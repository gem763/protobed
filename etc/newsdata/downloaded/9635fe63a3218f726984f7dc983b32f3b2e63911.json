Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in September 2018. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nA Columbia Journalism Review poll released this year found that half of all Americans have \u201chardly any confidence at all\u201d in the media, which beat out even Congress as the institution for which the public has the lowest confidence. It\u2019s not hard to see why. Last week, CNN reported that the CIA was forced to pull a highly placed source inside the Kremlin because of concerns that President Trump might burn him \u2014 when it turns out the decision to extract the source was made before Trump took office because of leaks from senior Obama administration officials.\n\nNow, the New York Times has published an adapted excerpt from a new book by Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly in which they breathlessly describe a \u201cpreviously unreported story\u201d about how Max Stier, a male college classmate of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, notified senators and the FBI that he saw Kavanaugh expose himself to a girl at a Yale party and that \u201cfriends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\u201d\n\nOne small problem: In the book, Pogrebin and Kelly write that the female student in question \u201crefused to discuss the incident\u201d and that \u201cseveral of her friends said she does not recall it.\u201d That calls the entire allegation into question. Yet the Times did not include this vital information in the excerpt it published.\n\nPogrebin and Kelly conveniently blamed their editors for the omission. Why didn\u2019t they insist it be included when they reviewed the story before publication? And how then do they explain the fact that they also failed to mention it in an interview with NPR? When asked by Terry Gross the specific question \u201cAre there other women who have come forward?\u201d (emphasis added), they repeat their uncorroborated accusation without mentioning that this \u201cother woman\u201d not only did not come forward but also does not recall the incident.\n\nThe Times was later shamed into appending an editors\u2019 note to the story saying \u201cthe book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.\u201d Too little, too late. This is simply journalistic malpractice. Indeed, if prosecutors in a court of law were to do what the Times did \u2014 fail to disclose evidence that goes toward negating a defendant\u2019s guilt \u2014 they could have their case thrown out and face potential disbarment for prosecutorial misconduct. But apparently in the court of public opinion, anything goes.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. In their article, the reporters innocuously describe Stier as someone \u201cwho runs a nonprofit organization in Washington.\u201d They fail to share with readers in the story the fact that Stier was a member of Bill Clinton\u2019s legal team at the same time that Kavanaugh was working for independent counsel Kenneth Starr on the other side of the Monica Lewinsky investigation. That seems relevant information that could call his motives into question.\n\nAmazingly, the Times story leaves out the one truly newsworthy revelation in the book. During the Kavanaugh hearings, Leland Keyser \u2014 whom Christine Blasey Ford named as a witness to her alleged assault \u2014 never testified, but her lawyer wrote the Senate Judiciary Committee that while she \u201chas no recollection of the incident in question \u2026 she believes Dr. Ford\u2019s account.\u201d In their excellent book, \u201cJustice on Trial,\u201d Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino first broke the news that Keyser told friends she did not in fact believe Ford. But Pogrebin and Kelly got Keyser to speak on the record for the first time. \u201cIt would be impossible for me to be the only girl at a get-together with three guys, have her leave, and then not figure out how she\u2019s getting home\u201d she told them, adding \u201cI just really didn\u2019t have confidence in the story.\u201d She also said she was pressured by many who \u201cwanted me to remember something different\u201d and threatened \u201cbehind the scenes that certain things could be spread about me if I didn\u2019t comply.\u201d\n\nFor some reason, the Times did not find this news fit to print \u2014 perhaps because it strengthens the case that Kavanaugh was smeared. The only thing more shameful than the Times\u2019s irresponsible reporting was news of all the Democratic presidential candidates who seized on theTimes story to call for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment. In light of Keyser\u2019s comments, they should be apologizing to Kavanaugh instead. And if the media wants to understand why it has surpassed Congress as the least-trusted institution in the country, here is a textbook example.\n\nRead more:\n\nHenry Olsen: Calls for impeaching Kavanaugh are damaging our democracy\n\nJennifer Rubin: This is the Kavanaugh mess we feared\n\nAlexandra Petri: There\u2019s nothing wrong with good, harmless fun!\n\nE.J.
