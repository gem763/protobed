No one will convince me otherwise. Why? Because comics have given me so much, taught me so much, shown me so many things. And I\u2019m not so dumb as to give all this up.\u201d\n\nDmitry Yakovlev, head of one of Russia\u2019s leading indie comic producers, the St Petersburg-based Bumkniga, was unfazed by the minister\u2019s dig. \u201cMedinsky\u2019s comment was pure stupidity, therefore supporting the comic industry,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cSales increased.\u201d\n\nYakovlev said that the number of comics published in Russia in recent years has significantly increased, with \u201ca fully-fledged comic book market forming in Russia\u201d.\n\n\u201cPhrases like \u2018comics are for children\u2019, for those who do not like to read or for idiots are present everywhere. But comics are a form of storytelling, like literature, cinema and theatre,\u201d he said. \u201cComics are read in Russia in the same way as in other countries. The value of comics is their universal language: the language of drawing is understandable anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nChrissy Williams, editor of comics including the Eisner award-nominated series The Wicked + the Divine, said she was \u201cappalled that any skepticism still remains on this point\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe language of comics, by definition, contains more components than the written word alone. It asks its audience to read words, but also images, in sequence, and the spaces between the images,\u201d she said. \u201cMaus \u2013 a moving and innovative memoir about the holocaust that spans multiple genres, utilising word and image to communicate so powerfully \u2013 won the Pulitzer prize in 1992. Of course comics are literature.\u201d\n\nCartoonist Stephen Collins, author of the forthcoming graphic novel Susan Wogan\u2019s Journey to the Stars, agreed. \u201cPeople often get this backwards, in my view,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat people are really saying when they ask this question is \u2018but are they literary?\u2019, which is essentially just a question about genre prejudice.\u201d\n\nFor Collins, \u201cmaking a comic feels very much the same as writing, so comics are certainly literature\u201d.\n\n\u201cWriting is just feeding information to the reader in deliberate sequence to get a desired response,\u201d he said. \u201cNovelists do that within a sentence, cartoonists do the same in dialogue and narration, as well as \u2018writing\u2019 the order of the panels, too. The only thing we can\u2019t generally do is write similes and evocative description of visuals, because typically they are shown. But in general, comics are very much \u2018literature\u2019 in their creation. I think that to question that is just to get confused by one\u2019s own genre biases.\u201d", "description": "Vladimir Medinsky\u2019s comments have sparked backlash from fans and boosted sales, according to one Russian publisher", "authors": ["Jade Cuttle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/941cabc79f030ffc46009e1dd0cdb0ab49e1f9e0/684_193_2675_1605/master/2675.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=11b06f25f102b0aaa600e8412154a10d", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
