And Boris Johnson knows it very well.\u201d\n\nBritish officials have so far remained tight-lipped in the face of the reports.\n\nThe reported plan would create a customs border in the Irish Sea with goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland being subject to tariffs which Britain would collect on behalf of the EU.\n\nBusinesses would then be able to claim a rebate once they had shown the goods were for consumption in the UK market.\n\nHowever it would mean that Northern Ireland would be able to benefit from any post-Brexit trade deals the UK struck with other countries around the world.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson refused to say whether he had offered a compromise (Alastair Grant/PA)\n\nSpeaking during a school visit on Friday, Mr Johnson repeatedly refused to say whether he had offered any concessions on the issue of the customs union.\n\nHe stressed however that he would not accept anything that \u201cdamages the ability of the whole of the United Kingdom to take full advantage of Brexit\u201d.\n\nTalks have been continuing in Brussels after the EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier gave the green light on Friday for intensive discussions between officials to start.\n\nIt followed apparent progress in talks on Thursday between Mr Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar at a country house retreat on the Wirral.\n\nTheir discussions appeared to unblock the negotiations which had seemed to have been running into the ground following the publication of Mr Johnson\u2019s Brexit blueprint.\n\nThe Prime Minister cautioned it was not a \u201cdone deal\u201d and there was still \u201ca way to go\u201d if they were to get an agreement which would enable Britain to leave on October 31, as he has promised.\n\nMr Barnier is due to brief EU ambassadors and MEPs on Monday on progress \u2013 but time is rapidly running out if they are to get an agreement in place in time for EU leaders to sign off on it at next week\u2019s Brussels summit.", "description": "Nigel Dodds says Boris Johnson `knows very well\u00b4 Northern Ireland must remain fully part of the UK customs union.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/18/wire-19632258-1570901925-611_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
