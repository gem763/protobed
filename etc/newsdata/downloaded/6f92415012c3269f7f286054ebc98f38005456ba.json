Right now, it\u2019s being called the iPhone 11R.\n\nI\u2019ve been using an iPhone 6S for about three years, and I can\u2019t wait to buy the iPhone 11R. It\u2019s said to come in beautiful new colors and have an incredible screen and an excellent camera.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nWe may be getting our first look at Apple\u2019s next iPhones on September 10, and I, for one, can\u2019t wait.\n\nThe new phones are said to be fairly similar to last year\u2019s iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max except for a few features, mainly that the cameras on all three phones are likely getting a redesign.\n\nWhile we won\u2019t know until next Tuesday what the devices are named, various reports have pointed to two different naming conventions: Apple could change the style to iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max, or it could keep the names similar to last year and call the phones iPhone 11R, iPhone 11S, and iPhone 11S Max.\n\nRead more: I\u2019ve tried every single iPhone currently available \u2013 here\u2019s my ranking of the 7 iPhones you can buy right now\n\nWhile most of the world is apparently losing interest in buying new phones, I feel the opposite: For the first time in several years, I can\u2019t wait to buy a new iPhone.\n\nI haven\u2019t gotten a new phone in about three years, since I upgraded to an iPhone 6S from an iPhone 5S. I\u2019ve been lucky enough to try lots of new phones over the years, which is part of the reason I haven\u2019t needed to upgrade. And for a long time, I was trying to decide whether I should switch to Android \u2013 especially after the Pixel 3 came out last fall, and again after trying Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S10e in April.\n\nBut through it all, I\u2019ve accepted the fact that it\u2019s easier for me to remain an iPhone user. I use Apple products for work, and being able to sync my computer to my phone makes life a lot easier. When it comes to my personal life, it\u2019s easier for me to stay on the iPhone too. The majority of people in my life \u2013 except for two of my sisters and a few friends \u2013 use iPhones, so messaging is a lot easier. Plus, I use other Apple products at home, like an Apple TV, an iPad, and a MacBook.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m a diehard Apple fan \u2013 it\u2019s just that it\u2019s easier to stay on the platform that I\u2019m already on.\n\nWhich is why, after trying most of the most popular high-end phones on the market over the past year or so, I still can\u2019t wait to buy a new iPhone. But I\u2019m not after the biggest, most expensive iPhone 11S Max, or even the smaller-but-still-expensive iPhone 11S.\n\nNo, the phone I\u2019m most excited about is the iPhone XR successor, the so-called iPhone 11R. Here\u2019s why.\n\nThe iPhone 11R is going to be cheap \u2014 at least relatively speaking.\n\ncaption The iPhone XR was $250 cheaper than the iPhone XS. source Anton NovoderezhkinTASS via Getty Images\n\nIf last year\u2019s iPhone XR is any indication, we can expect the iPhone 11R to be Apple\u2019s \u201cbudget\u201d iPhone.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear just yet whether Apple will stick to the same pricing structure it had last year: $750 for the \u201ccheap\u201d model, and $1,000 and $1,100 for the two premium models.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping Apple opts for a similar \u2013 or cheaper! \u2013 price range. While $750 is still a lot of money, it\u2019s significantly easier to pay up-front than $1,000 or more, and cheaper in monthly installments too. The iPhone XR costs about $32 a month right now, while the iPhone XS starts at $10 more a month.\n\nThe iPhone 11R will reportedly come in new, improved colors and have a \u201cfrosted glass\u201d look.\n\ncaption The iPhone XR came in six bright colors. source Anton NovoderezhkinTASS via Getty Images\n\nWhen the iPhone XR arrived last year, I was initially excited that Apple was embracing color for the first time since the iPhone 5C. Phones have gotten too boring, and Apple has been the ringleader for the past several years, opting for premium-looking, high-end colors (black, white, silver, gold, rose gold) instead of fun, eye-popping hues.\n\nBut when the wraps came off the iPhone XR, I was disappointed. The colors Apple chose \u2013 blue, yellow, coral, and red, along with black and white \u2013 were garish and cheap-looking. I had been set on buying an XR but ultimately held off because, quite frankly, I couldn\u2019t decide on a color I liked enough to own.\n\nBut Apple appears to have rethought its color scheme this year. The company is tweaking the colors to something more muted and stylish, according to the blog Macotakara.\n\nAnd here\u2019s what appear to be your next-generation iPhone XR colors (lavender purple and green instead of blue and coral) as @idanbo reported earlier this week: https://t.co/KQQ6JKmZg9 pic.twitter.com/7k3WZC2ZUi \u2014 Mark Gurman (@markgurman) May 14, 2019\n\nPlus, when Apple sent invitations to its event, it provided what seemed like another hint about the iPhone 11R colors:\n\nThose little glass shards, along with the top and bottom colors on that Apple logo, are giving me a lot of hope that the iPhone 11R will come in prettier colors. If they\u2019re accurate, it looks as if the most difficult decision I\u2019ll face this time around will be choosing between green and purple.\n\nThe iPhone 11R will have a gigantic screen, which might be OLED.\n\nOf the three iPhones Apple unveiled last year, the iPhone XR had the second-largest screen \u2013 smaller than the iPhone XS Max, but larger than the iPhone XS.\n\nIf Apple keeps the same dimensions for this year\u2019s iPhones, we can expect the iPhone 11R to be the same, and it\u2019s one more reason I\u2019m excited to buy it.\n\nAt 6.1 inches, the iPhone XR\u2019s screen is something like the Goldilocks of iPhones \u2013 not too big and not too small. While I don\u2019t love that it also means the body of the phone is a bit bigger and heavier than the iPhone XS (or, theoretically, iPhone 11S) I can live with it.\n\nOne thing that may change this year is the display technology. One of the main features that differentiated last year\u2019s premium iPhones from the iPhone XR was that the iPhone XS and XS Max had OLED displays, while the iPhone XR had an LCD display that Apple named \u201cliquid retina.\u201d\n\nBut that could change this year. In May, Reuters described a report from the South Korean news outlet Electronic Times as saying Apple might decide to go with OLED screens for all three models.\n\nThe iPhone 11R is probably going to have an incredible camera.\n\ncaption A dummy model of what could be the iPhone 11S or 11S Max. source YouTube/Unbox Therapy\n\nTruth be told, the iPhone XR already has a great camera \u2013 and it could be getting even better.\n\nApple seemed to take a page out of the Google Pixel playbook when it unveiled the iPhone XR last year. The phone featured a single-lens camera that relied heavily on software to achieve some of the features its more expensive siblings were capable of (namely, portrait mode).\n\nThe results were impressive, and there weren\u2019t many major differences between photos taken on the iPhone XR and on the iPhone XS.\n\nStill, Apple is expected to upgrade the camera on this year\u2019s iPhones. The iPhone 11R is said to be getting a second rear lens for better zooming, which is likely to feel like an improvement over last year\u2019s model. It\u2019s not clear whether the selfie camera is getting an update too, but that would be great \u2013 every little improvement helps.\n\nThe iPhone 11R will offer more for your money than the iPhone 11S and 11S Max will.\n\ncaption Dummy models of what insiders think the next iPhone lineup will look like. source YouTube/Unbox Therapy\n\nChances are, this year\u2019s iPhones will be similar to last year\u2019s iPhones. And if we\u2019re going by last year\u2019s prices and specs, it\u2019s hard to justify paying more for the top-of-the-line phone.\n\nThe iPhone XR cost $250 less than the iPhone XS and $350 less than the iPhone XS Max. It still has an excellent camera, an excellent screen, the same new A12 Bionic chip, plenty of storage, and wireless charging. Plus, it runs the same software as the higher-end phones.\n\nNo, you\u2019re not getting the premium-looking finishes or the unspoken air of luxury that comes with the iPhone XS. But you\u2019re still getting a very nice device, and one that does all the things you need it to \u2013 and you have at least $250 to spend on something else.\n\nI suspect that this year\u2019s lineup will offer the same, and in my view, you\u2019re making the wiser choice by buying the \u201cbudget\u201d iPhone.\n\nOverall, there are plenty of cool rumored features that will make it a major upgrade from my iPhone 6S.\n\nsource Avery Hartmans/Business Insider\n\nListen, it\u2019s not like my life is so tough. I have access to a lot of really nice phones because of my job, so I haven\u2019t been using my iPhone 6S full time for a few months.\n\nBut the thought of going back to it right now fills me with dread. To me, it feels antiquated and slow, the camera isn\u2019t up to snuff anymore, and the battery life is abysmal. Plus, the space-gray color is just so \u2026 boring.\n\nInstead, I could be using a device that comes in a bunch of fresh, fun colors and has a large, gorgeous display, an excellent camera, wireless charging, and great battery life. It\u2019s sort of a no-brainer.\n\nSo while I\u2019m not exactly excited to spend several hundred dollars in a few weeks, I still can\u2019t wait to buy the iPhone 11R.", "description": "Business Insider - I can't wait to buy the iPhone 11 because of the beautiful new colors, as well as the incredible screen and camera..
