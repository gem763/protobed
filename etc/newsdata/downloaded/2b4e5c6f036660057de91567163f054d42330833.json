Africa is expected to be certified free of wild polio by early next year following an independent evaluation process, however vaccine-derived cases of the disease still pose a challenge.\n\n\"We are confident that very soon we will be back here trumpeting the certification that countries have, once and for all, kicked polio out of Africa,\" said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa\n\nMoeti attributed present progress to an \"unprecedented scale\" of multinational effort by governments, partners, and health workers, who have deployed financial and technical resources to provide vaccination and education, especially in remote areas.\n\n\"It has involved men and women volunteering in the thousands, sometimes putting themselves in harm's way,\" Moeti said.\n\nOnce Africa is declared free of the disease, five of the WHO's six regions will be free of wild polio. Only what the WHO calls the Eastern Mediterranean is still fighting the disease, with polio still endemic in Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nWild vs vaccine-derived polio\n\nCases due to the wild poliovirus found in nature have decreased by more than 99% since 1988, from an estimated 350,000 cases then, to 33 reported cases in 2018, according to the WHO.\n\nMost of the time the virus dies off but it can sometimes spread in an area where there is low vaccination coverage. The solution for stopping this type of polio is for every child to be vaccinated to stop its transmission, according to WHO, which has noted that if a population is fully immunized, they will be protected against both vaccine-derived and wild polioviruses\n\nThe circulating vaccine-derived polio will be subject to a certification process that's separate from the wild polio process, according to WHO.\n\nThis year, 65 cases of wild polio virus and 51 cases of circulating vaccine-derived polio have been recorded , according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, compared to 18 cases of wild polio and 53 circulating vaccine-derived polio cases in 2018.\n\n\"Suboptimal routine immunization coverage remains a critical challenge in some countries,\" the WHO said in a statement. \"As a result, outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus -- a rare occurrence in communities with low levels of population immunity -- are still possible in several countries across Africa.\"\n\nPolio, or poliomyelitis , is transmitted person-to-person through the fecal-oral route or contaminated food.\n\nChildren under 5 are most vulnerable to the disease. Symptoms of the paralyzing disease include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness in the neck and pain in the limbs. There is no cure for polio. However, it can be prevented by a vaccine.\n\nBut owing to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative -- a partnership of WHO, UNICEF, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Rotary International and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation -- only Afghanistan and Pakistan have recorded cases of wild polio virus in three years.\n\nPolio remains a problem globally and a WHO committee designated the disease a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" in November 2018 due to its risk of international spread.\n\nEradication challenges\n\nIn August 2016, Nigeria reported a case of wild poliovirus in the northern state of Borno two years after it had reported none.\n\nPhotos: 10 diseases you thought were gone Photos: 10 diseases you thought were gone In the 19th century, scarlet fever was a common killer in Europe. In 2016, nearly 20,000 cases were reported in the United Kingdom -- the biggest increase in 50 years.\n\n\n\nScarlet fever is just one disease that many have forgotten but that is by no means gone, despite our best efforts to eliminate it.

Rickets is caused by a lack of vitamin D, which we get from sunlight. Experts believe rickets is making a comeback in developed countries because of the use of sunscreen and less time spent outdoors.
