But Netflix ads will no longer run on ABC, FX and Freeform and National Geographic.\n\nOne notable event that Netflix will miss is ABC's annual telecast of the Oscars. The company didn't respond to CNN Business' request for comment.\n\nDisney's decision comes less than a month after CEO Bob Iger resigned from Apple's board , a sign that the two companies are about to be serious rivals in the streaming game. Apple is launching its own streaming service in November.", "description": "Disney has taken the unusual move of banning Netflix from advertising on some of its networks as it continues to build its own streaming ambitions.", "authors": ["Jordan Valinsky", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191004110727-disney-netflix--stock-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
