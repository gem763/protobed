I will then take two TGV high-speed trains through France and Spain,\" he says.\n\n\"It will be a long journey but that is part of the fun - about 24 hours of travel but I should get to see some beautiful countryside.\"\n\nHe estimates that moving from aircraft to trains as his main mode of travel will be about 20% more expensive, but says his trip to Catalonia will only cost \u20ac40 (\u00a336) more.\n\nMr Molyneaux says there has been a lack of investment in Danish railways in recent years, but that appears to now be changing. He is also disappointed about the reduction in ferry services between the north of England and mainland Europe, with a number of routes axed in recent years.\n\nOnly 16% of British respondents said they were cutting back on flying, but 24% of US travellers were worried enough to change their flying habits.\n\nThe survey was first conducted in May this year and UBS said there had been a marked change since then.\n\nThe bank now expects the number of flights in the EU will increase by just 1.5% per year, which is half the rate expected by plane maker Airbus. The bank forecasted that growth in US flights would fall from the 2.1% expected to just 1.3%.\n\nAnd that could have a big impact on aircraft manufacturers.\n\nUBS estimates it could reduce the number of smaller planes ordered from Airbus and rival Boeing by 110 each year.\n\nThe bank said that would reduce revenues at Airbus, which controls around 57% of the market, by around \u20ac2.8bn (\u00a32.5bn) a year.\n\nAre you planning to fly less to help combat climate change?
