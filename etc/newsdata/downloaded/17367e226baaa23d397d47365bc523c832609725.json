Some passengers intervened and desperately tried to protect him while others assaulted him.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nIn the video, a woman shouts at the mob to back off and a Tube worker wearing a high-vis vest runs in to help the activist.\n\nPeople are heard pleading \u201cdon\u2019t do it\u201d as the protester is assaulted.\n\nFurther down the train, a commuter climbs on top of a carriage and shoves the other protester off the roof and onto the platform to cheers from the mob.\n\nAnother scuffle breaks out around the assaulted protester who is down on the platform. He is taunted by some of the passengers, including one man who calls him a \"f***ing d***head\".\n\nA commuter on top of the train then knocks off items belonging to the protesters to more cheers.\n\nAs the assaulted protester is hauled back onto his feet, the Tube worker shouts: \"No-one touch him.\"\n\nThe battered protester's face appears bruised.\n\nPolice arrived and detained the two protesters, according to witnesses.\n\nWitness Aaron Ramsden told Mirror Online: \"The protesters used a portable ladder to mount the train. I had arrived via the DLR to catch the Jubilee and over the tannoy the announcement was for people to leave the station.\n\n\"The protesters were being filmed and abuse and objects were thrown at them.\n\n(Image: mahatir_pasha/Twitter)\n\n\"People were asking for them to get down. People became restless and tried to grab their legs.\n\n\"The guy in the black suit tried to fend off people but eventually was dragged off and got kicked in by about five to ten people before others and the TfL staff could intervene.\n\n\"The other guy was chased along the top of the train and managed to get off further down away from the crowd and didn\u2019t get hurt.\"\n\nMr Ramsden added: \"The protester in the suit tried to fend people off before eventually getting grabbed by the ankle.\n\n\"The other protester didn\u2019t do anything. He looked worried when people started to try to grab them.\"\n\nAccording to another witness, one commuter yelled \"I need to get to work, I have to feed my kids\" as the crowd became angry.\n\nThe local MP reacted angrily to Thursday's travel disruption.\n\nJim Fitzpatrick, Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse, asked: \"So what point is Extinction Rebellion making shutting down east London's public transport system, preventing ordinary people from getting to work, school, hospital?\"\n\nJubilee line service was temporarily halted between North Greenwich and Stratford stations, and Canning Town was shut due to the stunt and the attack.\n\nExtinction Rebellion (XR) protesters also targeted Shadwell and Stratford stations in east London during Thursday morning's commute, the latest in a series of demonstrations by the anti-climate change group, who have been banned from protesting in London.\n\nAny assembly of more than two people linked to the XR Autumn Uprising action is now illegal in the capital.\n\nA Jubilee line passenger on a different train told how the service was halted and the driver later announced that it was moving again because \"your fellow commuters\" had dragged the protesters off a carriage at Canning Town.\n\nBritish Transport Police (BTP) said there had been four arrests so far at Stratford and Canning Town as the protests caused severe delays on the Jubilee line and the Docklands Light Railway (DLR).\n\nIt said: \"Shortly after 7am this morning British Transport Police were called to simultaneous action by Extinction Rebellion at Stratford, Canning Town and Shadwell.\n\n\"Protesters had dangerously obstructed Jubilee Line and DLR services by either climbing on top of services or by gluing themselves to the trains.\n\n\"Four arrests have been made in connection to the Stratford and Canning Town incidents, with those detained being taken to police custody.\n\n\"Specialist Protest Removal Teams remain at Shadwell station, and are working to resume services as soon as possible.\n\n\"We continue to urge protesters to not target the London Underground network.\n\n\"This is dangerous, not only for protesters but for commuters.\n\n\"We have increased our patrols on the London Underground and at other rail hubs throughout London.\"\n\nXR protesters continued demonstrations on Thursday and ignored a police warning not to target the Tube as part of its protests demanding action on climate change.\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan said of the disruptive demonstrations: \"I strongly condemn the Extinction Rebellion protesters who have targeted the London Underground and DLR this morning.\n\n\"This illegal action is extremely dangerous, counterproductive and is causing unacceptable disruption to Londoners who use public transport to get to work.\n\n\"It is also an unfair burden on our already overstretched police officers. I urge demonstrators to protest peacefully and within the boundaries of the law.\"\n\nBTP said they had engaged with XR members to prevent the planned 'disruptive and potentially criminal' action on the transport network.\n\n(Image: mahatir_pasha/Twitter)\n\nExtinction Rebellion co-founder Clare Farrell defended the Tube action and said: \"The public, I don't think, realise quite how serious this situation is.\"\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she added: \"It is still peaceful, and it is still non-violent.\n\n\"People did a similar action in April on the DLR train, those people were safe.\n\n\"It makes them vulnerable, and that's what people are there to do when they put their body on the line.\n\n\"There is a vast vulnerability that people have in the face of climate and ecological emergency.\"\n\nIt comes as XR's bid to defy the blanket protest ban on its protests across the whole of London will come before the High Court on Thursday.\n\nThose bringing the court action on behalf of the group, including Caroline Lucas MP and Guardian columnist and activist George Monbiot, are seeking to overturn the order imposed by the Met.\n\nLawyers representing the climate protesters will argue in a preliminary session that a full hearing of the case should happen 'as a matter of urgency'.\n\nThey will argue that the section 14 order imposed by the Met effectively banning all XR protests in London is unlawful.\n\nSince last week, protesters have targeted London City Airport, shut down areas around Parliament and the Bank of England, and blockaded Google's HQ, with more than 1,600 people arrested.\n\nMeanwhile, BTP has increased the number of visible patrols across London Underground, the DLR and other rail networks throughout the day to keep the trains moving.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan said BTP is working with partners to keep disruptions to a minimum.\n\nHe said: \"We are really disappointed that they have since announced fresh action on the London Underground network.\n\n\"The Tube and rail networks are one of the greenest transport methods in London, any action goes against what they campaign for and will only cause misery for London's commuters.\"", "description": "Extinction Rebellion protesters sparked travel chaos when they climbed on top of a Jubilee line train at Canning Town station in east London - but they were dragged off by furious commuters who didn't want to be late for work", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Sophia Dourou", "Caitlin Doherty", "Image", "Mahatir_Pasha Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20638941.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_BLPP_CHP_PMI_16148J1PG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
