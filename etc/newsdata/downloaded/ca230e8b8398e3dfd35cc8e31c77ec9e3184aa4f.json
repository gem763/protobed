They will grown hydroponically from nutrient-rich water solutions instead of using soil.\n\nThe scheme will require the UK\u2019s largest heat pumps, which will channel heat from warm water into the greenhouses to help speed the growth of the crop, before returning cool water back to the river system.\n\nThe carbon emissions from an on-site electricity plant will also be funnelled into the greenhouses for the plants to absorb as they grow.\n\nGreencoat Capital, the fund behind the world-first plans, estimates that the greenhouses will produce vegetables with a quarter of the carbon footprint of regular greenhouses. It could also create 360 permanent jobs in the area, and up to 460 at peak season, it said.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nGreencoat plans to start construction immediately and begin growing its crops by the autumn of 2020.\n\nJames Samworth, a partner at the fund, said Greencoat saw \u201cconsiderable opportunity\u201d to invest in renewable heat in the UK. This could help generate stable returns for its pension fund clients while helping to reduce carbon emissions as the UK worked to become a carbon neutral economy by 2050, he said.\n\nThe agriculture sector is considered a \u201chard to treat\u201d area of the UK\u2019s carbon-cutting agenda but renewable heat from power plants, factories or underground geothermal stores could help cut emissions.", "description": "Greenhouses bigger than O2 centre will be able to grow 10% of UK\u2019s homegrown crop", "authors": ["Jillian Ambrose"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa257e009111c97d193f7bd2a210a1549a794dfe/0_300_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=50d0d1a89b32da63abc78303899f15dc"}
