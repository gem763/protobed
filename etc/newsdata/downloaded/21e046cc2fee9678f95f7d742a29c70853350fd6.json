But I am not going to go into details, the page has turned. This is the first time I am saying this and it will be the last, because my head is now dedicated to Paris and I hope to help my team mates in our games.\u201d\n\nSome of the fans cheered the player after he scored the winner but there were also boos. During the game, supporters also barracked the controversial striker and held up offensive banners.\n\nNeymar, though, brushed off the incidents and appealed for fans to put their dislike of him to one side.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time I was totally booed. I was booed away from home in Brazil. I played in France away from home and I was booed.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s sad but I know that all the games from now on will be away games. I have nothing against the fans or PSG. I don\u2019t need them to cheer my name or be there for me.\n\n\u201cI want them to be there for PSG,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThey say PSG is bigger than any player. They need to forget that player and support the team, that is more important than booing. It didn\u2019t bother me at all. It\u2019s very sad. It bothers my team mates but it\u2019s part and parcel.\u201d", "description": "Paris St Germain striker Neymar expects to get a hostile reception no matter where he plays this season after sections of the home crowd turned a blind eye to his match-winning performance on Saturday and booed the want-away Brazilian.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429907787&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D0S7", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
