REUTERS/Rodrigo Garrido\n\nRepresentative Diego Ibanez told Reuters he had filed a petition with the country\u2019s Inspector General over fears that excavation work approved by regulators last month could cause irreparable damage to the site, which lies within a national park.\n\n\u201cThis is an affront to the law that regulates national parks in Chile,\u201d Ibanez, a member of Chile\u2019s far-left Convergencia Social party, said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe hope the Inspector General declares it illegal.\u201d\n\nAt issue is a collection of jewels and silver and gold coins that purportedly includes papal rings and Incan artefacts.\n\nTreasure hunters speculate the loot was buried by Spanish sailor Juan Esteban Ubilla y Echeverria on one of the three volcanic islands that make up the Juan Fernandez archipelago 600 kilometers (372 miles) west of Chile\u2019s central coast.\n\nRobinson Crusoe Island was so named because it was where Scottish explorer Alexander Selkirk was marooned in the 18th century, a tale documented by Daniel Defoe\u2019s novel, Robinson Crusoe.\n\nSaid to be worth as much as $10 billion, it has been the subject of an extensive, 20-year search by Dutch-American textiles businessman Bernard Keiser.\n\nIn the petition, Ibanez said his concern is with bringing heavy machinery into the 85-year-old national park and excavating the island\u2019s volcanic soils and bedrock, among the unusual natural features which initially prompted its protection.\n\nHe cited a prohibition in the park\u2019s management plan on \u201cremoving or extracting soil ... rock, or earth,\u201d and said government permits issued earlier this year violate this clause.\n\n\u201cKeep in mind that they\u2019ve been looking for this treasure for 20 years and still haven\u2019t found it,\u201d Ibanez said in the interview on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no indication that this new bedrock excavation is going to bear fruit. We\u2019re talking about causing irreparable geological damage. There is simply no justification for that.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Bernard Keiser did not reply to requests for comment.\n\nChile\u2019s CONAF forestry commission said in a statement released this week that Keiser\u2019s latest request to excavate an area of 20 meters by 20 meters (65.6 feet by 65.6 feet) was in keeping with Chilean environmental law.\n\n\u201cCONAF\u2019s main concern is the conservation and protection of the valuable natural and cultural resources in the state\u2019s protected wild areas,\u201d it said. \u201cAny type of intervention in this area will be duly supervised with the utmost rigor.\u201d\n\nChile\u2019s heritage minister, Felipe Ward, said in an interview with CNN Chile this week that he backed CONAF\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense to be able to rebut or confirm the existence of these historical remains,\u201d he said. \u201cThis authorization has existed for 20 years, so the criticism is a bit surprising.\u201d", "description": "A 20-year quest for a legendary trove of 18th century treasure on Chile's far flung Robinson Crusoe Island is facing fresh obstacles after a local lawmaker filed a claim seeking to block efforts to dig it up.", "authors": ["Dave Sherwood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433918519&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O27D", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
