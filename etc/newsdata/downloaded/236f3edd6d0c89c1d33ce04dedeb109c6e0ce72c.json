Two months ago the app, Tavola, went live, and 1,000 customers, along with 20 restaurants, are already using it. He and his small team hope to double those numbers by the end of the year.\n\nHassan is modest about his success. He says after his family, which is originally from Somalia, moved to the US when he was aged nine, he was determined to make it, despite not speaking English upon arrival.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

He also launched a blistering attack on congresswoman Ilhan Omar, whose family moved to the US when she was a teenager, from a refugee camp for Somalis in Kenya. Today, Minnesota\u2019s Somali-American population is around 70,000, mostly made up of people whose families fled civil war, and is the largest in the US.\n\n\u201cCongresswoman Omar is an American-hating socialist. How do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota?\u201d the president asked. \u201cShe is a disgrace to our country.\u201d\n\nExperts believe the decision to focus on Omar, 38, who last year won Minnesota\u2019s 5th congressional district and in doing so became one of the first two Muslim woman elected to congress, is deliberate. By demonising the progressive Omar, a member of the so-called \u201cSquad\u201d of Democratic congresswomen, the president hopes to portray the entire Democratic Party as extreme.\n\nOmar\u2019s supporters have rallied around her. In the first six months after taking office, she upset many with comments that were seen as ill-judged or taken out of context, about the attacks of 9/11, and the power of the pro-Israel lobby in the US. As a result, there was talk of her being challenged in the party\u2019s primary.\n\n(The 5th has long been heavily Democratic, and it is the primary contest, rather than general election, that decides the winner here.)\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

They say they have chosen her to represent them, and the president should respect that.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just really sad to see my president slandering my congresswoman,\u201d says 20-year-old Kiran Baum, emerging from the Hard Times Cafe in the Cedar-Riverside neighbourhood, that has a large Somali-American population. \u201cShe\u2019s very progressive and in line with Minnesota\u2019s values. She was elected because she represents the people here ... He\u2019s not in line with Minnesota\u2019s values. He\u2019s got a long track record of ignoring facts and only supporting things that benefit his view of white supremacism.\u201d\n\nLike many Somali Americans, Samjam Jummah, a mother-of-three who is hurrying to catch the commuter train, is mystified by the president\u2019s apparent obsession with the young congresswoman.\n\n\u201cHe should not be saying that about her,\u201d she says. \u201cShe is a good person. She likes everyone \u2013 black and white.\u201d\n\nAnother recent migrant to the city, who asks to be identified only as Abdul, says he found the president\u2019s comments \u201cdespicable\u201d. He says migrants who were successful in entering the US\u2019s visa lottery, or diversity, programme, considered themselves incredibly lucky. \u201cI have an MBA from California, after coming to the US. People come because they have a chance to to better themselves,\u201d he says.\n\nAsha Mohammad, a 35-year-old woman who was working at a store selling perfume and household goods, says she thought Trump was \u201ccrazy\u201d. \u201cIlhan \u2013 I like her a lot. She supports a lot of people.\u201d\n\nDavid Fettig has a regular show, called Write on Radio, on the area\u2019s largely-volunteer KFAI radio station network, that is dedicated to books, readers and writers.\n\nHe says he took part in the protests against Mr Trump\u2019s rally and found it cathartic. \u201cI went down there to be with people and celebrate those in opposition,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to be positive. I wanted to be with people who were for something, rather than against something.\u201d\n\nTrump and his re-election campaign have placed Minnesota at the top of the list of states won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 they hope to flip.\n\nDemocrats here are proud that it has the longest-winning streak of any state in the country. Even amid Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1984 re-election landslide when he bagged 49 of 50 states, local senator Walter Mondale, the party\u2019s presidential candidate, clung on to Minnesota.\n\nBut in 2016, Trump came within two points of defeating Clinton, whose campaign here, as in many parts of the upper northwest, was rather haphazard. And he did that without major investment.\n\nBrad Parscale, Trump\u2019s campaign manager has vowed that in 2020 they will spend millions of dollars to target Minnesota and its 10 electoral college votes.\n\n\u201cIn 2016 we spent less than $30,000 here. In 2020, we\u2019ll have a tens-of-million-dollar campaign. I think Minnesota is winnable,\u201d says Parscale, as he waits for Trump\u2019s arrival at the Target Centre, the location of the rally.\n\n\u201cI think it was probably winnable in 2016, but it\u2019s more winnable now, because millions of people in this state have been successful under a Trump government.\u201d\n\nLocal Democrats are aware of the challenge and are determined to see off Trump\u2019s bid to pick up new states, as his path to re-election appears to narrow.\n\nKen Martin, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labour Party, an affiliate of the Democratic Party, says people are ready to confront him head on.\n\n\u201cI think there is a personal element about his interest in Minnesota,\u201d he says. \u201cDonald Trump is a trophy hunter. There could not be be a bigger feather in his cap [than flipping Minnesota].\u201d\n\nOmar declined The Independent\u2019s request for an interview, and her office failed to respond to written questions. When Trump made his attacks, she said his \u201chate is no match for our movement\u201d.\n\nAbdi Hassan, the entrepreneur whose family hails from Somalia and who expresses gratitude every day to be living in the United States, says he found the president\u2019s comment deeply offensive.\n\nAt the same time, he says he has little time for negativity, as he works on his project to connect customers and restaurants by having people order and pay online in advance. This helps speed up the process and gives restaurant staff an idea of how many people they might expect.\n\nHe pitched the idea two years ago at a tech start-up competition, where he came in second, allowing him to attract some early investors even as he finished studying at the University of St Thomas.\n\n\u201cNever wait in line again,\u201d says Tavola\u2019s website. \u201cReserve your table at a restaurant and pre-order your food directly from the app.\u201d\n\nHe says the media should consider stopping giving Trump the constant attention he receives when he makes negative comments, thereby starving him of oxygen.\n\n\u201cThe president should have a much higher standard. Those things he said were just really rude and unfair,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s been getting hate since she went to DC. But she\u2019s been focused really well. She\u2019s been working.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cShe\u2019s been growing on social media. Her ticket price has gone up. She\u2019s made the best of the situation. She\u2019s trying to be positive and trying to ignore the hate and still work, which is really hard to do.\u201d", "description": "Abdi Hassan has a quick response to Donald Trump\u2019s race-baiting claim that Minneapolis had accepted too many Somali immigrants: immigrants, he i", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/25/04/abhi-msp-2.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
