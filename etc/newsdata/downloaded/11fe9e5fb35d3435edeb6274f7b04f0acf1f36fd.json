IHS Markit has released its flash estimates for September\u2019s Purchasing Managers\u2019 Indexes (PMIs) in the Eurozone along with those for France and Germany. The German data were downright ugly. There\u2019s no oomph or oompah in Germany. Instead, has fallen into a recession and is dragging down the rest of the economy. Real edged down 0.3% (saar) during and is up just 0.4% y/y (Fig. 1). Another q/q decline is likely during Q3.\n\nIn the Eurozone, Markit estimates that the (C-PMI) fell from 51.9 during August to 50.4 this month (Fig. 2). The drop was led by the (M-PMI), which is down from a recent peak of 60.6 during December 2017 to 45.6 this month. However, the (NM-PMI) also contributed to the month\u2019s decline, falling from 53.5 to 52.0. Germany stands out with an M-PMI that is now down to 41.4 compared to 50.3 in (Fig. 3). Also weakening in Germany is the , which is down from this year\u2019s high of 55.8 during June to 52.5 in September (Fig. 4).\n\nI\u2019ve previously observed that there is something wrong with Germany\u2019s economy. Trump\u2019s trade wars may be part of the problem, but Germany\u2014along with most of the rest of the world\u2014has a serious homegrown problem: not enough babies and too many seniors. Babies tend to stimulate consumption as they grow older, while old people don\u2019t stimulate much of anything. It\u2019s hard to stimulate people who are already old to do much of anything.\n\nThat may explain the weakness in global auto sales in recent years (Fig. 5). Germany\u2019s manufacturing economy is particularly dependent on the auto industry. Let\u2019s have a closer look at Germany\u2019s economy:\n\n(1) Tougher emission standards. In the Eurozone, regulators made things worse for the industry with new emission standards imposed a year ago. The new EU-wide test procedure was the authorities\u2019 reaction to VW\u2019s 2015 admission to widescale cheating on diesel vehicles, with suspicions since spreading to other manufacturers.\n\n(2) Losing cache. Germany\u2019s high-performance and high-priced Bimmers and Benzes may not be as popular with Millennials around the world as they were with the Baby Boomers. Millennials tend to be minimalists. They are more concerned about fuel economy and are likely to favor electric vehicles once EVs become cheaper and have more range.\n\n(3) Competing with Chinese EVs. A 9/20 Bloomberg article titled \u201cChina Is Winning the Race to Dominate Electric Cars\u201d hits on several of the issues plaguing Germany\u2019s automakers. For starters:\n\n\u201cThe global auto market is not only not growing, but it is also shrinking. Sales peaked in 2017 at nearly 86 million on a trailing-12-months basis; right now in 2019, sales are closer to 76 million.\u201d\n\nThe future for the auto industry is EVs, which are mostly made in China:\n\n\u201cThere is only one company in the top 10 by percent of electric passenger vehicle revenue that isn\u2019t Chinese: Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi Corp. Two Chinese automakers get more than 40% of revenue from electric vehicle sales; a third gets nearly a quarter of its revenue from EVs.\u201d\n\n(4) Fiscal stimulus coming? In August, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she sees no need for a stimulus package \u201cso far\u201d but added that \u201cwe will react according to the situation.\u201d She pointed to plans to remove the so-called solidarity tax, an added income tax aimed at covering costs associated with rebuilding the former East Germany, for most taxpayers.\n\n(5) Green new deal. The problem is that the government plans to spend $60 billion through 2030 on green new deals, which are more likely to weigh on the economy than to stimulate it. According to the 9/20 WSJ article on this subject:\n\n\u201cThe measures, including subsidies for green power generation, will be financed by revenues from higher taxes on polluting activities, such as air travel and car fuel, as well as a new carbon emission certificate trading scheme to be launched in 2021. The package won\u2019t affect Germany\u2019s balanced budget. Despite international pressure on Berlin to loosen the purse strings and revive a slowing economy, the country\u2019s budget surplus is projected to stand at over \u20ac40 billion in 2019.\u201d\n\nThe government will help to finance more than a million charging stations for EVs by 2030. Owners and buyers of EV cars will get government subsidies, which might further depress gasoline-powered auto sales.\n\nDraghi Saying Give MMT a Chance. Outgoing ECB President Mario Draghi told European lawmakers that Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) should be considered to stimulate the slowing economy of the Eurozone. \u201cIt\u2019s a government decision, not [that of] the central bank,\u201d he said. During his tenure, Draghi\u2019s monetary policy commitment to \u201cdo whatever it takes\u201d to save the Eurozone economy hasn\u2019t been enough, so I am not surprised that before his 10/31 departure he is calling on fiscal policy to save the day.\n\nThe basic tenet of MMT is that a government may borrow and spend to infinity and beyond because it controls the creation of money. Under MMT, governments can never run out of money to pay their debts, say MMT advocates. They would only cease MMT if inflation heated up.\n\nOn his way out the door, Draghi set the stage for MMT in the Eurozone by lowering the ECB's official deposit rate from -0.40% to -0.50% and restarting the asset-purchase program. The ECB is set to buy \u20ac20 billion per month in Eurozone securities, including government bonds.\n\nIt is unlikely that German leaders will readily take the advice of the ECB, let alone its outgoing president, to consider an idea like MMT. Officials of the EU\u2019s largest economy deeply value fiscal discipline. They undoubtedly will protest that MMT violates the principles of the Maastricht Treaty, the official treaty on the European Union signed in 1992, which emphasizes sound fiscal policies and limits on debt.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Ed Yardeni covering: .
