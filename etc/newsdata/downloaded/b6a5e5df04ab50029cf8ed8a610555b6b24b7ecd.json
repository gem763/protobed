We accept the verdict of the people and the PDK moves to the opposition,\u201d conceded Kadri Veseli, whose party is tied to President Hashim Thaci and has been in power since 2007.\n\nWith no one taking an absolute majority, the opposition camps will need to unite to seal the PDK\u2019s place in the opposition.\n\nThey have little overlap ideologically but have already signalled interest in joining forces.\n\n\u201cI will offer them a hand of cooperation as Prime Minister of Kosovo to crown the change,\u201d Vetevendosje leader Albin Kurti said late Sunday of the LDK.\n\nMeanwhile, the LDK\u2019s prime minister candidate Vjosa Osmani, said she believed the parties would \u201csit down and talk about a coalition\u201d.\n\nKurti, who will be tasked with forming the government if his party\u2019s lead is cemented, first gained fame as a student activist protesting Serbian repression in the 1990s before the war broke out.\n\nThe 44-year-old has since become a strident critic of Kosovo\u2019s political elite, and his place at the helm would herald a new era for the young democracy.\n\n\u201cWe have waited a long time for this victory,\u201d said Ardi, a student in Pristina who joined exuberant crowds celebrating with flags and fireworks in the capital late Sunday.\n\nKurti\u2019s party \u201cbrings a big change and gives us young people hope to see a future here,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 Serbia talks \u2013\n\nSunday\u2019s snap poll was called after ex-prime minister Ramush Haradinaj, a former guerrilla commander, resigned in July to face questioning by a special court in The Hague investigating war crimes from the 1998-99 separatist conflict with Serbia.\n\nHis party, which was allied with the PDK in the former government but this time ran alone, had one of the weaker showings with 11.6 percent.\n\nIn addition to tackling a host of social and economic problems at home, the new leaders will now be under heavy pressure from the West to resolve Kosovo and Serbia\u2019s \u201cfrozen conflict\u201d.\n\nThe neighbours have yet to normalise ties two decades after they clashed in war, a lingering source of instability in Europe.\n\nKosovo, a former Serbian province, is recognised by most of the West but it needs Belgrade \u2014 and its allies Russia and China \u2014 to accept its statehood to get a seat in the United Nations.\n\nSerbia is also under pressure to make peace with Kosovo in order to move forward with its EU accession process.\n\nYet their EU-led dialogue has been at a standstill for more than a year, with frequent diplomatic provocations souring efforts to build goodwill.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Let them negotiate\u2019 \u2013\n\nIf the dialogue with Belgrade does resume, one of the most sensitive issues will be settling what powers to grant Serb-majority administrations in Kosovo.\n\nThere are approximately 40,000 Serbs living in the north and 80,000 scattered in and around a dozen enclaves in other parts of Kosovo, whose 1.8 million population is mainly ethnic Albanian.\n\nSerbs have 10 reserved seats in parliament and the Srpska Lista party, which aligns with Belgrade, looked set for a landslide.\n\nSpeaking in Belgrade, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said he would be ready to talk to Kurti\u2019s party if they are deemed the \u201clegitimate representatives\u201d of Kosovo.", "description": "Pristina (AFP) \u2013 Opposition parties won the night in Kosovo\u2019s election Sunday, taking the lead over former guerrillas who have dominated", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/bb65e4_diplomatic-hopes-polls-local-people-are-far-concerned-issues-high-unemployment-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
