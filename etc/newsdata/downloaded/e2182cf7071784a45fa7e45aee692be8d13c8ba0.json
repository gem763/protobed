However, unbeknownst to him, a teacher saw the young man and snapped a picture while he stood alone in the parking lot, waiting for the song to end.\n\n\u201cNo one was there,\u201d Pope recalled. \u201cI just stopped because it was the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nBefore the teacher posted the touching image to social media, she called his mother, Lauren Pope, to ask for permission.\n\n\u201cShe wanted to point out what a proud moment and how special he was for doing something like that when no one was looking,\u201d his mother said.\n\nThe photo quickly received over a thousand likes and shares and lots of positive comments online.\n\n\u201cThey said God bless this boy. I know he\u2019s been raised right. Amen. Awesome kid,\u201d the teenager told reporters.\n\n\u201cCharacter is what you do when no one else is looking,\u201d his mother said of her son\u2019s patriotic gesture. \u201cHe defines that.\u201d\n\nIn September 2018, Breitbart News reported a similar instance, where four teenage boys stopped in the parking lot of a high school in Midland, Michigan, when they heard the national anthem begin playing at a football game.\n\nThe report said Mike Ullery Jr. snapped a picture of the moment when the boys removed their ball caps and placed their hands over their hearts.\n\n\u201cI was impressed by these Bullock Creek boys. Running late to the game they heard the national anthem and stopped, took off their hats and placed hands over heart,\u201d Ullery wrote in a Facebook post, adding \u201cRespect.\u201d", "description": "A high school football player in Davidson County, North Carolina, is being praised for his quiet act of patriotism.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Jacob-Pope-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
