No \u201cguts,\u201d no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator!\u2019 President Trump\n\nThe comments from the president via Twitter mark his latest demand from the Fed to aggressively slash benchmark borrowing costs and his most recent rebuke of the Fed boss for not doing so at Trump\u2019s hoped-for pace and magnitude:\n\nJay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No \u201cguts,\u201d no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2019\n\nThe 45th U.S. president has frequently blasted Powell, who he nominated, and has called on the Fed to deliver easier monetary policy to sustain the economic expansion in its 11th year, as well as boosting stock markets. The Fed chairman has said that the central bank\u2019s decisions aren\u2019t political.\n\nThe Fed on Wednesday voted to cut interest rates by a quarter-percentage point to range of 1.75%-2%, as expected, marking the second cut this year. Voting against the action were St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who preferred to lower the target range for the federal-funds rate to 1.50% to 1.75%. Kansas City Fed President Esther George and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren both preferred to maintain the target range at 2% to 2.25%.\n\nPowell & Co. have described the reduction decision, even as the U.S. economy has appeared to be relatively healthy, as an \u201cinsurance cut\u201d to forestall the negative effects of the yearlong trade dispute between the U.S. and China that has hurt major corporations in the U.S., including FedEx Corp. FDX, -12.92%. Internationally tariff disputes have threatened to dampen already-wobbly global economic growth.\n\nFollowing the Fed rate moves, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.13% fell 200 points, or 0.8% to 26,907, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.03% was 27 points, or 0.9%, lower, at 2,978. The Nasdaq COMP, -0.11% lost 99 points, or 1.2%, to trade at 8,089.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday afternoon delivered further harsh criticism of the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after the central bank cut...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HO840_fed_MG_20190805141546.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
