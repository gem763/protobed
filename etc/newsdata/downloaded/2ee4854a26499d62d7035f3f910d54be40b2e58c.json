None have won nine straight.\n\nAfter Friday night, it\u2019s still none. The Houston Astros took enough small bites out of the Nationals\u2019 baby shark carcass Friday night for a 4-1 win in Game 3 of the World Series.\n\nThis means that with a 2-1 Washington lead in the best-of-seven series, there will be a Game 5 Sunday night at Nationals Park. That means if he follows through on his statement, President Trump will be in attendance.\n\nLet us not forget that in June 2017, when the champion Chicago Cubs made their visit to the White House, Cubs executive Todd Ricketts told the president that they would probably be meeting the Nationals in the playoffs later that year and \u201cyou\u2019ll see them crumble.\u201d\n\nTo which Trump reportedly replied, \u201cThey probably will.\u201d\n\nNever mind that they did. Plan accordingly.\n\nThe Nationals guaranteed a Game 5 with their worst game since their last loss \u2014 10-4 in Game 3 of the National League Division Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nThey won the next two to clinch the division series, swept the St. Louis Cardinals in four games in the NL Championship Series and then won the first two games of this World Series in Houston.\n\nThey came home to Washington knowing that the odds of a team coming back from a 2-0 deficit in a best-of-seven series are like 20%.\n\nThe Astros knew that too, but they didn\u2019t seem to care.\n\nThis was Washington\u2019s first misfire since the Dodgers loss.\n\nAnibal Sanchez, who carried a no hitter into the eighth inning in his last start in Game 1 against St. Louis, struggled with home plate umpire Gary Cederstrom\u2019s strike zone and gave up four runs on 10 hits and one walk over 5 1/3 innings pitched.\n\nThe Astros worked over the Nationals one run at a time \u2014 an RBI single by Josh Reddick in the second inning, an RBI single by Michael Brantley in the third, another RBI single by Brantley in the fifth and a solo home run by Robinson Chirinos in the sixth.\n\nThe powerful Nationals offense made it easy for Houston starter Zach Greinke, with their big bats like Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto going after balls early in the count.\n\nIt was a rough 21st birthday for Soto, who had one error in left field and went 0 for 4 at the plate, including the final out, looking at a third strike from Astros closer Roberto Osuna. Washington scored once in the fourth inning when Ryan Zimmerman walked and Victor Robles brought him home with a triple to left.\n\nThe Nationals came into Game 3 hitting 7 for 21 with runners in scoring position. They left 12 runners on base Friday night.\n\nThe sold-out crowd of 43,867 was primed for more.\n\nThe atmosphere on Half Street leading up to the centerfield gate was as energized as I\u2019ve ever seen it before the game \u2014 loud and raucous, with street performers dressed in sparking suits singing Ray Charles to a fan standing on a folding stool in an umpire\u2019s costume reading out loud the baseball rule book.\n\nIt was crazy, befitting the first World Series game the city has hosted in 86 years.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t Houston\u2019s first rodeo, though. The Astros may not be as lovable and fun as the Nationals, but they have their own culture of winning that has brought them three straight 100-plus win seasons and a 2017 World Series title.\n\nHere\u2019s how Astros manager A.J. Hinch described that culture before the game. \u201cWe have a great vibe in our clubhouse and chemistry amongst our guys,\u201d he said. \u201cIf one guy is down the next guy steps up. If one guy is struggling the next guy helps him. Part of that is just the experience. We\u2019ve been around a lot of winning. But winning doesn\u2019t come for free. It\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s not just throw the balls out there and end up at the end of the game doing well. It\u2019s a lot of preparation. It\u2019s a lot of dealing with some adversity. It\u2019s about dealing with slumps or not a lot of people just lay fastballs right down the middle for these guys.\u201d\n\nThe Astros won 107 games this season in the American League. They had winning streaks of 10 games twice and one eight-game streak during the season.\n\nIf Washington can win eight straight playoff games, then Houston can win four out of five.\n\nOf course, that would qualify as crumbling \u2014 even at this late stage of the postseason, farther than any of the four previous Nationals playoff teams have gone.\n\nWhat Washington has to avoid crumbling is a safety net of quality starters, with lefthander Patrick Corbin (14-7, 3.25 ERA, 238 strikeouts) on the mound for Game 4 Saturday night. Houston is out of quality starters and will go with a bullpen game \u2014 four or five relievers stitching together a start.\n\nThe Astros could find themselves fraying at the edges.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
