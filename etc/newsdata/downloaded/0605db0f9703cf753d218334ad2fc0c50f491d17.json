About 6.8 percent of male undergraduates reported being victims of similar incidents.\n\nThe survey used data from 33 universities, including half of the Ivy League\u2019s eight members \u2014 Harvard, Yale, Brown and the University of Pennsylvania \u2014 and other major campuses including the University of Virginia and Washington University in St. Louis, The Washington Post reports.\n\nAbout 181,000 students responded to a confidential online questionnaire.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe results provide cause for both hope and continued concern,\u201d AAU President Mary Sue Coleman said in a statement. \u201cThey reveal that while students know more about university-sponsored resources for victims of sexual assault and misconduct, they still aren\u2019t using these resources often enough.\u201d\n\nThe survey is the group\u2019s second to be published in recent years. The Post reports that its results show similar patterns of campus sexual misconduct as earlier findings, however students in the most recent survey seem to know more about what sexual assault is and how to find help.\n\nMany students who are victims of sexual violence still don\u2019t report the incidents to officials, researchers found, for reasons including shame, feeling they can handle it on their own or that they didn\u2019t think the event was that serious.", "description": "Approximately 25 percent of undergraduate women report being victims of sexual violence since they started college, according to a new survey analyzing data from 33 universities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/yaleuniversity_michaelmarsland.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
