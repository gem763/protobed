Eduardo Verdugo/Pool via REUTERS\n\nFormula One stewards also imposed two penalty points on the 22-year-old Red Bull driver for the incident after Mercedes driver Valtteri Bottas crashed on the final corner at the end of qualifying.\n\nVerstappen compounded the offence by appearing defiant in a news conference before he was summoned.\n\n\u201cI was aware that Valtteri crashed,\u201d the Dutchman, whose pole now goes to Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc, had said.\n\nAsked whether he had backed off, he replied: \u201cDidn\u2019t really look like it, did it? No.\u201d\n\nYellow flags warn drivers that they must reduce speed for safety reasons and be prepared to change direction suddenly.\n\nVerstappen was handed a three-place grid drop at last year\u2019s Russian Grand Prix for failing to slow for yellow flags in qualifying, and a similar drop looked likely from the moment of the summons.\n\nAsked about the safety perspective, Verstappen had said: \u201cI think we know what we are doing, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be driving an F1 car.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s qualifying and you go for it. If they want to delete the lap, then delete the lap.\u201d\n\nThe comments drew a firm response from Bottas\u2019s team mate Lewis Hamilton, who now starts third and could seal his sixth championship if results go his way in Sunday\u2019s race, when asked about respecting the flags.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really, really important that the FIA are very, very strict with the double yellow flags. There could be marshals on the scene,\u201d he told reporters, recalling previous incidents that raised safety concerns.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t even need to stay flat out, he\u2019d already got pole basically.\n\n\u201cLuckily there were no marshals on the track. For all he knew, Valtteri could have been in the middle of the circuit and marshals could have been there. That\u2019s what double yellow means \u2014 could be a massive incident ahead.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he ignored it, I mean it\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s done and hopefully the right calls are made and put in place. The drivers need to know to respect those things,\u201d added the Briton.\n\nVerstappen set his pole time with the first flying lap of the final top-10 session and faced yellow flags on his later second effort.\n\nHe has a chequered record with stewards, particularly in Mexico \u2014 in 2016 he was demoted from third to fourth in the race after stewards ruled he had gained an advantage by leaving the track limits.", "description": "Max Verstappen was stripped of his Mexican Grand Prix pole position and handed a three place grid drop on Saturday for failing to slow for yellow warning flags.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445376640&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q04N", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
