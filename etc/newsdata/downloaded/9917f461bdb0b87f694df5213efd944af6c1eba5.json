There were a lot of first-home buyers, a couple of investors and some downsizers interested in thir particular property.\"\n\nIn Canberra, a three-bedroom brick house in Hackett, in the city's north, sold for $865,000 to another couple buying their first home. Of the six registered bidders, three were looking to get into the market for the first time.\n\nThree first-home buyers registered to bid on this Canberra property which sold for $865,000.\n\n\"There hasn't necessarily been an increase in first-home buyers but the pattern I've seen is the increase in the price they are purchasing at, which is symptomatic of the market as a whole because obviously prices are going up. \"The number of first-home buyers paying over $800,000 or even $1 million has increased,\" LJ Hooker's Nic Salter-Harding said.\n\nMr Salter-Harding said the government's price cap for Canberra properties at $500,000 would push people to the outskirts of the city or to compromise on size.\n\n\"Mostly what $500,000 will get you in Canberra is a basic two-bedroom apartment around the city, depending on the quality and size, or probably a three-bedroom house on the outskirts of the ACT,\" he said.\n\nTreasurer John Frydenberg and Minister for Housing Michael Sukkar released the government's draft Investment Mandate for the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme on Sunday. It revealed the \"appropriate price thresholds\" for properties depending on city and region.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven the latest Domain Group data puts Sydney's median house price at $1,079,491, the scheme's $700,000 price threshold for the city would ultimately push first-home buyers into the apartment market, according to property analyst Louis Christopher of SQM Research.\n\n\"This is actually not going to help anyone who is trying to buy a house. The threshold is quite clearly well below the median house price for what sounds like nearly every capital city. So this, in effect, is only going to assist those first time buyers intending on buying units and a fairly modest units at that,\" Mr Christopher said.\n\n\"Yes okay the ambitions of first-home buyers shouldn't be buying grand mansions to begin with, but this is obviously disqualifying a whole lot of property, particularly in the Sydney market,\" Mr Christopher said.\n\nAMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said that while the number of applicants, which will be capped at 10,000 a year, was \"marginal\" the scheme would nevertheless add to the buying pressure already felt just four months into the property market's recovery, during which time prices have risen about 5 per cent in Sydney and Melbourne.\n\n\"The problem now is that there was some sense to [the scheme when it was first announced in May] because the property market was down. Now I think the risk is that there will be a 10,000 first-time buyers with extra spending power and that will push up prices at a time when they're already going up,\" Mr Oliver said.\n\nFirst home buyers who apply for the government's scheme in Queensland will be able to purchase properties in Brisbane and the Gold Coast up to $475,000 in value.\n\nThe initiative begins on January 1, 2020 and removes the cost of lenders mortgage insurance for individuals with an annual income of up to $125,000 or couples with a combined $200,000 per year who haven't saved the standard 20 per cent deposit required by banks. It is expected to cut the time taken to save for a deposit for by at least half.\n\nThe Property Council welcomed the announcement saying the scheme came at a time of declining construction levels for new housing, which had an an impact on jobs, housing affordability and supply.", "description": "Frst-home buyers are stretching themselves financially to remain competitive at auction as the government announces a cap on prices for its new first home buyers scheme.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3677%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_988%2C$y_374/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/afe22e680284914d710283f8892f6bfd5d13d59c", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
