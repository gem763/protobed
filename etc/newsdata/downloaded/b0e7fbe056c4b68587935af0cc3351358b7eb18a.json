The goods manufactured at the plant will be labeled with \u201cMade in the USA\u201d tags.\n\nOver the past three decades, free trade agreements and globalization of the U.S. economy have devastated American fashion manufacturing production and U.S. garment workers. Since 1990, fashion manufacturing jobs in the U.S. have declined by more than 80 percent, dropping from about 900,000 jobs to just 150,000 jobs in 2011, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports.\n\nTwo years after the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), companies laid off a total of 706 American workers from fashion manufacturing jobs in the U.S.\n\nBetween 1996 and 2011, companies laid off an average of 323 American workers every year in the fashion manufacturing industry. In that same period, American workers in textile mills suffered an average of 200 layoffs per year. In 1996, some 1,040 American workers in the clothing, textile, and leather manufacturing industry were fired from their jobs.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
