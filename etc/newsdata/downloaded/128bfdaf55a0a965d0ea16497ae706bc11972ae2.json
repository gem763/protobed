Even being an identity \u201ctwo-fer\u201d does not suffice, as demonstrated by a New York Times story in March 2019. In that case, a young black man who identified as gay was employed as a \u201csensitivity reader\u201d by several publishing houses\u2014i.e., an enforcer of \u201ccancel culture.\u201d Then he wrote and tried to publish a book of his own. The result, as the Times story put it, was a \u201ckarmic boomerang.\u201d Despite the author\u2019s conformity overall to an identity-first narrative, he made the catastrophic mistake \u2014 by identity-first standards \u2014 of situating some of his story among Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo\u2019s civil war in the late 1990s. Following a Twitter storm, he withdrew his debut book before circulation. As the reporter summarized, \u201cHe was Robespierre with his own neck in the cradle of the guillotine.\u201d\n\nAll of which raises an interesting question about these and many others hoist on the identitarian petard: What, exactly, explains the primordial passion behind identity politics?\n\nHere\u2019s a guess: Decades into the potent experiment of the sexual revolution, a great many human beings now live as if we are not the intensely communal and familial creatures that we always have been; and systemic consequences of that profound species-wide shift are now emerging. These include our increasingly surreal politics. Identity politics is driven in large measure by a question that generations before us never had to answer: Who am I? Until very recently, that question has been answered at least implicitly by reference to one\u2019s role in a familial social order: I am a mother, a sister, a cousin, an aunt, and so on. Today, in an age when families form and re-form and un-form at record speed, all of those \u201cgivens\u201d have become attenuated. The result is a frantic search for self via other groups that substitute for the loss of familial gravity\u2014namely, identity politics.", "description": "", "authors": ["Mary Eberstadt", "Thebulwark.Com Trudeau-Buttigieg-Harris-Yang-Identity-Politics-Eats-Its-Own"], "top_image": ""}
