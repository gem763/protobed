REUTERS/Lisa Baertlein/File Photo\n\n(Reuters) - Kroger Co (KR.N) said on Monday it would stop selling e-cigarettes at its stores and fuel centers, making it the latest U.S. supermarket chain to take the step amid growing regulatory scrutiny of the product.\n\nThe company said it would discontinue sales after selling through its current inventory and cited \u201cmounting questions and increasingly-complex regulatory environment associated with these products\u201d for its decision.\n\nKroger\u2019s move comes a month after Walmart Inc (WMT.N) said it would stop selling e-cigarettes and electronic nicotine delivery products at its U.S. stores. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) had also said it would take down vape paraphernalia from its website.\n\nE-cigarettes have been marketed as tools to help smokers quit, but rising use among youth in the United States and a spate of severe lung illnesses and some deaths tied to vaping have triggered a backlash and heightened regulatory scrutiny.\n\nNew York and Michigan have already banned the sales of flavored vaping products, while the Trump administration has announced plans to remove all flavored e-cigarettes from store shelves as officials warned that sweet flavors had drawn millions of children into nicotine addiction.\n\nUp to last week, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 18 deaths due to a mysterious lung illness linked to e-cigarettes and other vaping products and said the number of confirmed and probable cases of the condition now exceeds 1,000.", "description": "Kroger Co said on Monday it would stop selling e-cigarettes at its stores and fuel centers, making it the latest U.S. supermarket chain to take the step amid growing regulatory scrutiny of the product.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438164164&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF961HF", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
