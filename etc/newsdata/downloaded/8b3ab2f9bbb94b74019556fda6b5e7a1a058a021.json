Locked down.\u201d\n\nVideos of the action posted on social media showed several demonstrators had scaled an awning above the entrance and displayed the group\u2019s flag \u2014 an hourglass symbol \u2014 on the building as staff looked on through windows from inside.\n\n\u201cWe, the people, have decided to do your job and Tell the Truth from the BBC Broadcasting House about where we\u2019re headed if we don\u2019t change course,\u201d Extinction Rebellion said in a statement on its Facebook page about the latest stunt.\n\n\u201cWe hold you accountable for your criminal and corrupt complacency for totally marginalising the seriousness of the #PlanetaryEmergency.\u201d\n\nA BBC spokeswoman said the news company \u201calready covers many climate change and environmental issues across its output\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe know how important these issues are to audiences and will continue to focus on them across both news and non-news programmes,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nThe demonstration is the latest in a week of long-planned protests by Extinction Rebellion in countries around the world to highlight what it claims is the inadequate response of governments to climate change.\n\nThe protests in Britain have seen more than 1,000 people arrested since Monday.\n\nThursday\u2019s actions included an attempted \u201cHong Kong-style occupation\u201d of the terminal building at London City Airport in the east of the capital, with hundreds blocking the main entrance.\n\nOne demonstrator, identified by the protest group as former Paralympic cyclist James Brown, climbed on top of a British Airways jet.\n\nThat prompted criticism from Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick who called the act \u201creckless, stupid and dangerous\u201d.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Extinction Rebellion climate protesters on Friday blocked the main entrances at the BBC\u2019s London headquarters, with one", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/219001_activists-managed-scale-an-awning-entrance-bbc-london-headquarters-climate-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
