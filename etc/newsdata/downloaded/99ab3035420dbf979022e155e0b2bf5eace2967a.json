Getty Images\n\n\u201cYou choose profit over planet, profit over people, profit over our future.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental activists aren\u2019t the only threat LFW is facing this season. With the increasing likelihood of a no-deal Brexit and concerns that the move could potentially cost the fashion industry up to \u00a3900m, many fear that this season could mark the last time the bi-annual trade event occurs in its entirety.\n\nNonetheless, designers are remaining defiant, instead choosing to channel current events into their designs.\n\nLast week\u2019s New York Fashion Week (NYFW) proved that fashion isn\u2019t afraid to get political, with Prabal Gurung presenting pageant-style sashes printed with the words, \u201cWho gets to be American?\u201d\n\nBut, it\u2019s here, on the other side of the pond, where the real change is happening.\n\nThe week-long event kicked off with a strong showing from the city\u2019s emerging creative class who, as well as proving that London is a global hot bed for fashion talent, used their platforms to spread a message.\n\nFrom environmentalism to women\u2019s rights, here\u2019s our roundup of the best moments from the first day of shows.\n\nMark Fast mourns the Amazon rainforest\n\nCanadian-born Mark Fast opened LFW on Friday with a collection inspired by his love for the Amazon rainforest.\n\nA timely muse considering that just a few months after he began researching for the new collection, the area was ravaged by devastating fires.\n\nThe designer, who said he fell in love with the colours of the Amazon \u2013 from the macaws and birds of paradise to the different species that inhabit the vast undergrowth \u2013 witnessed all that beauty disappear right before him.\n\nAlas, the sentiment behind Fast\u2019s collection quickly converted from a \u201cparty in the jungle\u201d to a tribute to the beauty, colours and creations that were lost.\n\nUtilising a vibrant palette of aqua blue, neon green and hot pink, models displayed an abundance of feathers, snake print booties and bodycon blouses.\n\nThrough these pieces, Fast\u2019s signature edgy glamour ran wholeheartedly throughout the collection, as did his unique approach to celebrating the natural curves of the female form with his tight-fitting silhouettes.\n\nA decade on from his catwalk debut, during which the knitwear designer caught the attention of LFW-goers by enlisting size 12 and 14 models to walk in his show, Fast resurrected an important conversation about body image.\n\nWith a cast of models equally as broad ranging and an eco-activist undertone, Fast\u2019s spring/summer 20 offering served as a reminder of the need for more diversity and a better understanding of the fragility of our environment, within the fashion world.\n\nBora Aksu celebrates female empowerment\n\nTurkish designer Bora Aksu has been a mainstay on the LFW calendar for many years, regularly showing on the first full day of the week-long event.\n\nSo much so, that by now show-goers have become accustomed to his design aesthetic which seamlessly fuses romantic sensibility with raw elegance.\n\nFor spring/summer 2020, the London-based designer delivered his usual ethereal quirks, this season inspired by Persian princess Taj Saltaneh.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the royal was considered a trailblazer of feminism: she founded Persia\u2019s inaugural underground women\u2019s group, the \u201cWomen\u2019s Freedom Association\u201d, was the first woman to take off the hijab and wear western clothes, and even led a march to Parliament.\n\nIt was this journey from young princess to activist that formed the basis for Aksu\u2019s collection, which saw opulence contrast with simplicity, a mix of hard and soft textures, and layered gowns saunter down the runway alongside boyish tailoring.\n\nThe colour palette reflected this juxtaposition too, gradating from powder pinks to fluorescent orange and deep blue brocade.\n\nBy channelling the voice of Saltaneh, Aksu articulated his concerns with the industry in. the era of #MeToo while simultaneously cementing female empowerment as his raison d\u2019\u00eatre.\n\nAmanda Wakeley rebukes fast fashion\n\nAmanda Wakeley wants you to shop less. It\u2019s an odd mission statement for a fashion designer, considering they make a living out of people who shop. But at a time when the fashion industry\u2019s carbon footprint is under more scrutiny than ever before, designers such as Wakeley are changing tact, encouraging us to shop consciously and trade hasty fast fashion buys for investment pieces you can cherish.\n\nWakeley\u2019s spring/summer 2020 collection is packed with such pieces. For the upcoming season, the British designer, whose high-profile clientele ranges from Scarlett Johansson to the Duchess of Sussex, was inspired by the balmy climes of Havana, Cuba.\n\nPalm tree prints have been stitched into sunshine yellow frocks while shades of exotic fruits including papaya and pomegranate have been splashed across billowing beach dresses and loose-fitting blouses.\n\nThere are some delightful anomalies to the theme, such as a tailored sleeveless suit whose deep mustard plaid conjures up a thrilling Clueless-for-grown-ups mood.\n\nThere\u2019s also something for fans of Wakeley\u2019s infamous eveningwear \u2013 usually a perennial mix of liquid silk gowns and breezy chiffons \u2013 via a gold beaded gown with a central black ribbon and a leaf-like print. It\u2019s Edie Sedgewick goes to the ball, if the ball is in a glamorous tiki hut and serves pina coladas in crystal coupes.\n\nWakeley is a seasoned traveller, with collections often inspired by past trips. But not this one, because the 56-year-old designer not actually been to Cuba. I\u2019m assured she will visit soon.", "description": "The commencement of London Fashion Week (LFW) conjures many images, from crowds of peacocking people to window-tinted Mercedes and the flashing camera bulbs of frenzied paparazzi.
