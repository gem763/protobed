I revere Marty, & I do see his point, but\u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Well there\u2019s a reason why \u201cI\u2019m always angry\u201d. (sic)\n\nIt comes after Martin previously admitted he\u2019d tried and failed to enjoy the Marvel movies, which include money-spinning franchises like Infinity War and Endgame, Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America.\n\nMartin has his views (Picture: Invision)\n\nAccording to the director, the genre simply didn\u2019t chime with his own cinematic tastes.\n\nWhich is fine, sure, but he\u2019s enraged a whole franchise of fans in the process\u2026\n\nHe shared: \u2018I don\u2019t see them. I tried, you know? But that\u2019s not cinema.\n\n\u2018Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks.\n\nJames Gunn is a beloved Marvel director (Picture: WireImage)\n\n\u2018It isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\u2019\n\nOver the weekend James spoke out on social media about Martin\u2019s comments.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018Martin Scorsese is one of my 5 favorite living filmmakers. I was outraged when people picketed The Last Temptation of Christ without having seen the film. I\u2019m saddened that he\u2019s now judging my films in the same way,\u2019 James wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe went on to add: \u2018That said, I will always love Scorsese, be grateful for his contribution to cinema, and can\u2019t wait to see The Irishman.\u2019\n\nJames\u2019 comments saw mixed reactions from fans \u2013 while some agreed with him and argued that Martin\u2019s claims were unwarranted, others argued that the two situations can\u2019t be compared.\n\nThe 53-year-old went on to write: \u2018For those tweeting me I\u2019m somehow saying zealots picketing Last Temptation is the same as Scorsese judging my films, I\u2019m not. What outraged me about the picketers at the time of Last Temptation is NOT that they thought the film was blasphemous. Nor that they were picketing.\n\n\u2018Doing those thing are within their rights. What bothered me was that 99% of them were doing it without having seen the movie.\u2019\n\nCan we just all agree all their films are amazing.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
