He was given a caution, while a 25-year-old student is being investigated by the university.\n\n\"There was a Chinese student who even threatened that he would kill us if we openly criticise China,\" said a second year software engineering student at Sheffield.\n\n\"I never thought he would actually throw glass bottles at us, it reminded me of being on the train in Hong Kong when pro-China triads assaulted me. I thought Sheffield was a safe city. Why should I suffer from a similar situation as I did in Hong Kong when I am now in the UK?\"\n\nVincent Mak, president of Sheffield's Hong Kong society, said that students feel the lack of support they have received from the university has been \"shocking\".\n\n\"There is a very serious sense of hyped up nationalism among Chinese students,\" he said. \"I don\u2019t think the university understands the severity of the danger that we face as Hong Kong students.\n\n\"We don\u2019t trust the university can help us anymore. We don\u2019t feel safe in Sheffield, we don\u2019t feel welcome here. There are more Chinese students who bring more profit to the university. As a stake holoder we don\u2019t have much more say.\"\n\nThe number of Chinese students applying to British universities has increased by 30 per cent since last year, from 15,240 to 19,760.\n\nThere is huge demand among the growing Chinese middle class for their children to have an English education, while British institutions are rushing to cash in on the higher, international student tuition fees they bring in.\n\nNick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said that universities have become \u201cover-reliant\u201d on student numbers from China in recent years.\n\n\u201cAs the Indian numbers have tailed off we are now left with a disproportionate number of Chinese students and that leaves universities very conscious about their relationship with China,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to be very careful not to come down on one side or another and ensure the safety of all students.\u201d\n\nMPs were warned last month that the \"sheer number\" of Chinese students in the UK means that their influence should be considered as they can \"change the nature\" of an institution.\n\nDr Christopher Hughes, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Sciences (LSE), told the foreign affairs select committee that some Chinese students at British universities \"are being manipulated and used by the embassy and their agents\" in an organised fashion.\n\nLiverpool University students have told how during a pro-democracy rally on campus they were \"surrounded\" by Chinese students.\n\n\"They were singing their national anthem in a provocative manner,\" said Sam Lai, a first year Liverpool student. \"Some of them approached us and threatened us, saying they will find us and beat us up. One of them attempted to assault us but the police stepped in.\"\n\nMeanwhile, an Aston University student described the harassment she faced while taking part in a pro-Hong Kong event in Birmingham city centre.\n\n\"It varies from taking close-up pictures and videos for identification purposes, shouting abuse and even physically following us after our events,\" she said.", "description": "Police have been called following a series of clashes between Hong Kong and Chinese students as universities are accused of failing to protect them.", "authors": ["Camilla Turner"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oX2vWWYxi_tuOu60ozkhJg--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/904fcc4dcbceaacdef6a41896e070acc", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
