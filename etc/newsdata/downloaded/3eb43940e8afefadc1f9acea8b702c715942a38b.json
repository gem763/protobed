The entire communities of Windsor and Healdsburg, where one of the original evacuation shelters was set up, were ordered to evacuate.\n\nThe Sonoma county sheriff\u2019s office said it is expected to be the biggest evacuation in the county in more than 25 years, with warnings to be prepared to leave reaching the coast. Traffic snarled roadways leading out of the communities of Windsor and Healdsburg as residents scrambled to close up their homes, find last-minute accommodations and transport their livestock to safety.\n\n\u201cOnce we get that red-flag warning starting at 8pm and we get those high winds, we\u2019re going to see some erratic fire behavior,\u201d said the Cal Fire captain Stephen Volmer, a fire behavior analyst with the agency. \u201cThere is the potential for a lot of this fire-weakened timber to be falling down across power lines, across roads. There is also the potential for those long-ranged spotting issues that we have to ignite new fires.\u201d\n\nThe National Weather Service described the conditions as \u201cthe strongest since the 2017 wine country fires and potentially a historic event given the strength and duration of the winds\u201d. The Tubbs fire of that year killed 22 people.\n\nThe Kincade fire broke out late on Wednesday night and has so far destroyed nearly 50 structures. There have been no fatalities but a firefighter and two civilians were injured when they were overwhelmed by fire as they tried to evacuate from approaching flames, authorities said.\n\nMeanwhile, millions across the state will have their power cut again as California\u2019s largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), said it would shut off electricity for the third time in as many weeks. PG&E said the power cuts would be implemented in stages through Saturday afternoon and evening for about 940,000 homes and businesses in 36 counties for 48 hours or longer throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, wine country and Sierra foothills. An estimated 2.35 million people are due to be affected, thousands more than previously predicted.\n\nTwo previous power shutdowns were done amid concern that gusty winds could disrupt or knock down power lines and spark devastating wildfires.\n\nThe Kincade fire burned near Geyserville, California on 24 October.

The Tick fire, which started on Thursday, has destroyed nine homes and businesses while threatening 10,000 more, according to firefighters. While some evacuees were allowed back into their homes as of Friday night, certain mandatory evacuation orders still remained.\n\nAs of Saturday afternoon the Tick fire was 25% contained, while the Kincade fire was 10% contained.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, has declared a local emergency to assist with battling the blazes, and thousands of firefighters have been deployed to both locations.\n\nPG&E has a history of sparking wildfires throughout the state, including two of the deadliest disasters in recent California history.\n\nFirefighters battling the Kincade fire discovered what appeared to be a broken jumper by a PG&E transmission tower that had lost power. Though PG&E had shut off power to the area as part of planned shutoff, the transmission lines remained energized, the utility said. The cause of the Kincade fire is still under investigation.", "description": "Fresh evacuations in Sonoma county as Kincade fire spreads and wave of power blackouts begin across the state A firefighter works to extinguish the Tick fire in a factory near Santa Clarita, California, 24 October 2019.
