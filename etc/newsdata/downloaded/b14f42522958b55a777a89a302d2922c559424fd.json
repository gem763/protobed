WinFuture reports that the G8 Plus will feature a triple-camera array on its rear, and it will feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor powered by a 4,000mAh battery.\n\nThe phone\u2019s three rear cameras will reportedly consist of a 48-megapixel main camera, a 16-megapixel 117-degree wide angle camera, and a third 5-megapixel depth sensor alongside a laser autofocus system. That\u2019s pretty much the same as what we saw on the Motorola One Zoom when it was announced last month, minus that phone\u2019s titular telephoto lens. It\u2019s a decent upgrade over the basic dual camera found on last year\u2019s Moto G7 Plus.\n\nBattery is another area where the G8 Plus is rumored to improve on its predecessor. The G7 Plus included a 3,000mAh battery, which is three-quarters of the 4,000mAh battery in this year\u2019s model. That\u2019s not quite as big as the 5,000mAh battery in the G7 Power, but it\u2019s still a big improvement.\n\nOtherwise, the specs reported by WinFuture are more typical of a device that\u2019s likely to be released at a budget price point. The phone includes a 1080p 6.3-inch IPS display with a small notch up top and the option of either 64GB or 128GB of internal storage alongside its 4GB of RAM. There\u2019s also a 3.5mm headphone jack alongside the USB-C port used for charging.\n\nIf Motorola\u2019s past device history is anything to go by, the Moto G8 Plus could be accompanied by as many as three other devices when it\u2019s announced. Mobielkopen has unearthed images of one such device, which it speculates could be either the Moto G8 or G8 Play. Details are a little bit thinner for this device, but the images suggest it has one fewer lens on its rear, perhaps an indication that it lacks the laser autofocus system found on the Plus.\n\nWinFuture reports that the lineup is expected to be announced at an event in Brazil on October 24th. That\u2019s a little early, considering the G7 lineup was only announced back in February. But since the Moto G7 phones are some of the best budget smartphones around, we\u2019re not going to complain too much about an early follow-up.", "description": "Images and details about Motorola\u2019s unannounced Moto G8 Plus have just leaked online.
