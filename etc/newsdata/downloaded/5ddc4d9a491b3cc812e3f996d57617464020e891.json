It was anyway before, but now it has additional meaning, knowing this is where we hung out together.\"\n\nHis son, Jerry, was home visiting from college when he died in a drowning accident on Kentucky Lake in July 2016.\n\nMorgan came back to the Opry this past summer to sing the tribute song he wrote about his son.\n\nHe sang about crying until he passed out, praying until he thought he couldn't anymore and realizing that one day he'll be reunited with his son.\n\nMorgan stepped off stage, physically and emotionally exhausted from the performance, and told his friend Ricky Skaggs, the bluegrass singer and Country Hall of Famer, that he didn't know if he could sing that song again.\n\n\"Ricky told me, 'You have to sing this song for the rest of your life,'\" Morgan recalled.\n\nCRAIG MORGAN REFLECTS ON SON'S TRAGIC DEATH: 'EMOTIONALLY, HE'S WITH US'\n\nMorgan's first song in three years has now been championed by his peers at the Opry and the music community at large.\n\nHis friend and fellow Opry member Blake Shelton spent several days tweeting about the song and urging his 20 million followers to download the track from iTunes and push it up the charts.\n\nSoon other celebrities -- including Clarkson, Ellen DeGeneres, Luke Combs and Carson Daly -- joined Shelton's impromptu social media campaign.\n\nThe song hit No. 3 on Billboard's country digital song sales without the help of a label or radio play.\n\n\"I didn't even know what was happening,\" Morgan said. \"I was in Alaska and had no idea what was going on until I started getting texts from everyone.\"\n\nMorgan, an Army veteran who has had hits like \"That's What I Love About Sunday\" and \"Redneck Yacht Club,\" said that since releasing the song, he's been reading the hundreds of messages sent daily to him by fans who identify with the grief and pain, but also the hope that he described in the song.\n\nCOUNTRY SINGER CRAIG MORGAN RESCUES CHILDREN FROM BURNING HOUSE\n\n\"I felt a push,\" he said. \"I felt shoved to do this, and not by people. For me, it was God.\"\n\nThe song lyrics are also a reference to Morgan's conversion to Roman Catholicism, which his family, including Jerry, had been going through at the time of the teen's death.\n\nMorgan's faith and religious education are something he leaned on heavily over the past three years, he said.\n\n\"And I know I'll see my son again because I know his faith,\" Morgan said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMorgan, who announced in September a new record deal with Broken Bow Records, said that the song has given him a purpose to help comfort others, especially people who have lost a child, and that this was always God's plan.\n\n\"You know, the thing is, I would much rather none of this stuff happen and him to be able to be here,\" Morgan added. \"But that's not the way it is. And now he's in a place where what's happening has a different meaning.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Since bringing the music world to tears last Thursday while performing\u00a0his tribute song,\u00a0\u201cThe Father, My Son and the Holy Ghost,\u201d to his late son, Jerry, on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show,\"\u00a0Craig Morgan\u00a0has\u00a0been inundated with widespread support from fans and\u00a0artists, empathizing with the country crooner in his bereavement.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/05/craig_morgan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
