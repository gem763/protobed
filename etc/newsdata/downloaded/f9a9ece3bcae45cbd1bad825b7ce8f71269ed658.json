My integrity has never been questioned until now.\"\n\nHowever, he maintained, \"I believe that I handled this matter in full compliance with the law at all times.\u201d\n\nMaguire has come under fire from Democrats for initially withholding a copy of the complaint from lawmakers. That standoff was resolved when the complaint was declassified, and released to the public, in advance of the hearing. But Maguire was still pressed for answers from Democratic committee members on why his office did not hand over the complaint at first.\n\nCommittee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., questioned Maguire Thursday over the timeline of his cooperation with the committee. Maguire said he was not able to release the document at first because of executive privilege concerns and other issues. He also said he is not aware of any instance where such a complaint dealt with such \"complicated and sensitive issues.\"\n\n\"I believe that this matter is unprecedented,\" he testified. He also said he does not know the identity of the whistleblower, but said they acted in \"good faith.\"\n\nThe complaint cites \u201cmultiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call\" between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and accuses Trump of attempting \u201cto pressure the Ukranian leader to take actions to help the President\u2019s 2020 reelection bid.\u201d It also presents allegations that the White House tried to \"restrict access\" to records of the call.\n\nREAD THE WHISTLEBLOWER'S COMPLAINT\n\nThe complaint goes on to allege that White House officials said they were \"directed\" by White House attorneys to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they are normally kept. Instead, the transcript was allegedly kept on a different system normally used for classified information.\n\nWHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT HAS BEEN DECLASSIFIED AND CONTAINS NO 'SURPRISES,' GOP LAWMAKER SAYS\n\nThe complaint contains allegations related to Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July, when he urged him to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nRep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, told Fox News late Wednesday that he had viewed the declassified complaint, and said it didn't contain any new damning information.\n\nStewart told \"The Ingraham Angle\" late Wednesday that he was initially \"anxious\" before he viewed the complaint, but now is \"much more confident than I was this morning that this is going nowhere.\"\n\n\"There are just no surprises there,\" he said.\n\nThe White House, on Wednesday, released an unclassified version of the transcript of that highly controversial phone call. The memo, which does not reflect a \u201cverbatim transcript\u201d but is based on \u201cnotes and recollections\u201d of those memorializing the call, shows Trump congratulating Zelensky on his election victory before Trump eventually gets to the subject of the Bidens, seeking an investigation of some kind.\n\nTrump first asked Zelensky to do a \"favor\" and \u201cfind out what happened\u201d with the hacking of the DNC server in 2016. He referenced CrowdStrike, a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks.\n\nThen, Trump went on to seek assistance in investigating the Bidens.\n\n\u201cThe other thing, there\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it\u2026It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nThis refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings \u2014 where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.\n\nDEMS DOUBLE DOWN ON IMPEACHMENT AFYER UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE\n\nWhile the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to \u201clook into\u201d the Bidens, it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid \u2014 which had been frozen days earlier, a detail that fueled impeachment calls earlier this week and helped prompt House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday.\n\nHours after the transcript was released, Trump met with Zelensky on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. Reporters asked Zelensky about the call with Trump, and whether he felt pressured by the U.S. president, as alleged by the whistleblower\u2014an accusation he denied.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI think you read everything. I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t want to be involved in democratic elections of the USA,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a good phone call. It was normal, we spoke about many things.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI think you read it that nobody pushed me.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have also raised concerns about the whistleblower's possible \"political bias,\" as the intelligence community inspector general found indications the whistleblower was \"in favor of a rival political candidate\" of Trump.\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram, Gregg Re, Ed Henry, and Jake Gibson contributed to this report.", "description": "Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, in tense testimony Thursday on Capitol Hill,\u00a0defended his handling of the explosive whistleblower complaint alleging President Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the Biden family --\u00a0while calling the issue \"unprecedented.\"", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
