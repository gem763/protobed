But Lampard made a big step.\n\n(Image: Darren Walsh)\n\n\u201cHis arrival at Chelsea means the club are caring for their legends. I joked with him after the Chelsea move, I want to be his assistant when I retire.\n\n\"I hope he will be successful at Chelsea for many more years. I also want to see John Terry in similar jobs in the future because he was our leader on the pitch.\u201d\n\nMikel won the Champions League, the Europa League, two Premier League titles, three FA Cups and a League Cup with Chelsea.", "description": "Former Chelsea midfielder knew Lampard would make it as a manager - but thought John Terry would get there first", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Getty Images Sport", "Darren Walsh"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article7293905.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/5_John-Terry-Chelsea-Career-Europa-final.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
