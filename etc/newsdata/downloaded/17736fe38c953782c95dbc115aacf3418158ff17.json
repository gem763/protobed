It is also one of the world's top destinations of foreign direct investment.\n\nHong Kong is a hub for start-ups in places like Science Park, with tech companies large and small in a campus-like environment.\n\nGetting a \"good turbo boost early on\"\n\nAnd there\u2019s Cyberport, which has incubated companies like 'Valoot', an e-payment system used by Hong Kong taxi drivers. It\u2019s the brainchild of a Romanian former banker.\n\n\"I couldn\u2019t recommend Cyberport more for someone who\u2019s trying to break ground in Hong Kong,\" said Ovidiu Olea, CEO of 'Valoot Technologies'.\n\n\"It does give you a pretty good turbo boost early on. We\u2019re actually using Hong Kong as a springboard and we\u2019re looking to expand our taxi payment project next door to Macau.\"\n\nMacau and its casinos are in the Greater Bay Area, or Pearl River region that includes Hong Kong and the cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou.\n\nAlso at Cyberport, Pierre Mouette is chief technical officer at 'Clim8'. The start-up makes wearable heaters with thermal sensors that adjust to body temperature via the 'Internet of Things'.\n\n\"There are more than 1,000 start-ups here in Cyberport, so it\u2019s huge,\" Mouette told reporter Chris Burns.\n\n\"We started in Cyberport. We became incubatees almost two years ago. So the incubation programme helped us a lot. First for money, because every start-up needs money..That's the game. But Cyberport also helped us meet with potential investors and also for all the media. So having all these kinds of start-ups just at Cyberport helps us to engage and also find the right talents.\n\nHigh-rent, high-rise solutions\n\n\"We have R&D in France, we\u2019ve got PhDs there, so it\u2019s really good. And here we have production, based in Hong Kong and also Shenzhen - mostly Shenzhen and the Dongguan area, so for me it\u2019s a two-hour ride, just from here. So it\u2019s really efficient.\"\n\nThe shared workspace concept in high-rent Hong Kong is rising fast, making it easier for start-ups that don't want to invest in bricks and mortar.\n\nAcross the city are seven buildings belonging to 'Campfire', a firm that provides flexible office space, hot desks and common areas with creative facilities.\n\nAmong the companies there, Karena Belin founded 'WHub', now a network of more than 2,000 start-ups.\n\n\"I think the best way to describe it is, it\u2019s one of the most diverse eco-systems, with regard to different verticals,\" she said.\n\n\"It\u2019s not only about fintech. We have a lot of sectors that are involved. If we look at our unicorns, they come from various sectors. They come from fintech, they come from logistics, they come from travel tech, they come from AI. And Hong Kong is very strategically positioned geographically. You\u2019re in a five hour\u2019s radius of half of the world's population. And you're next to the manufacturing powerhouse, which is the Pearl River Delta. It's easy and safe. It's highly connected.\n\n\"There\u2019s even more to come about the Greater Bay Area. It\u2019s basically 11 cities here. And if you would need to compare it to other eco-systems like the US, if you think about putting Silicon Valley, Las Vegas and New York into one area, this is what the Greater Bay Area is.\"\n\nTamim Batcha is Head of Community at Campfire, whose job it is to stir the embers.\n\n\"We build micro-communities that are either fashion-based, tech-based, fintech-based, ed tech-based, health tech-based, prod design, marketing-based, and we put them within a space that's geographically suitable for their business,\" Batcha told 'Spotlight'.\n\nWe\u2019ll be back again soon with another edition from Hong Kong, looking at how people there work hard but also play hard!", "description": "Hong Kong is a magnet for worldwide talent, where professional dreams come true", "authors": ["Chris Burns"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/16/93/25/1000x563_cmsv2_3b271856-4970-53a8-8535-fc25a8d089aa-3169325.jpg", "published_at": "2018-06-11"}
