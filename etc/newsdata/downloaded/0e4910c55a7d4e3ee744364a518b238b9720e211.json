Valuable workers flee to cheaper cities. People end up living on the streets. Rent control is a relatively quick way for lawmakers to take action as tensions rise.\n\nGo deeper: Curbed LA has more details about the new law, including its exemptions.", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
