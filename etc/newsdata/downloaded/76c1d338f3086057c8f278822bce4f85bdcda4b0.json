Facebook have dropped a ban on \u201cdeceptive, false or misleading content\u201d in political ads.

I asked if we could scan ads for misinfo. Engineers had great ideas. Higher ups were silent. Free speech is b.s. answer when FB takes $ for ads. Time to regulate ads same as tv and print.https://t.co/eKJmH7Sa7r \u2014 Yael Eisenstat (@YaelEisenstat) October 9, 2019\n\nIn a further question, Collins asks what specific proposals Eisenstat\u2019s team made; to what extent Facebook determined them to be feasible; and on what grounds were they not progressed.\n\nHe also asks what plans Facebook has to formalize a working relationship with fact-checkers over the long run.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson declined to comment on the DCMS letter, saying the company would respond in due course.\n\nIn a naked display of its platform\u2019s power and political muscle, Facebook deployed a former politician to endorse its \u2018fake ads are fine\u2019 position last month \u2014 when head of global policy and communication, Nick Clegg, who used to be the deputy prime minister of the UK, said: \u201d We do not submit speech by politicians to our independent fact-checkers, and we generally allow it on the platform even when it would otherwise breach our normal content rules.\u201d\n\nSo, in other words, if you\u2019re a politician you get a green light to run lying ads on Facebook.\n\nClegg was giving a speech on the company\u2019s plans to prevent interference in the 2020 US presidential election. The only line he said Facebook would be willing to draw was if a politician\u2019s speech \u201ccan lead to real world violence and harm\u201d. But from a company that abjectly failed to prevent its platform from being misappropriated to accelerate genocide in Myanmar that\u2019s the opposite of reassuring.\n\n\u201cAt Facebook, our role is to make sure there is a level playing field, not to be a political participant ourselves,\u201d said Clegg. \u201cWe have a responsibility to protect the platform from outside interference, and to make sure that when people pay us for political ads we make it as transparent as possible. But it is not our role to intervene when politicians speak.\u201d\n\nIn truth Facebook roundly fails to protect its platform from outside interference too. Inauthentic behavior and fake content is a ceaseless firefight that Facebook is nowhere close to being on top of, let alone winning. But on political ads it\u2019s not even going to try \u2014 giving politicians around the world carte blanche to use outrage-fuelling disinformation and racist dogwhistles as a low budget, broad reach campaign strategy.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before on Facebook of course, during the UK\u2019s Brexit referendum \u2014 when scores of dark ads sought to whip up anti-immigrant sentiment and drive a wedge between voters and the European Union.\n\nAnd indeed Collins\u2019 crusade against Facebook as a conduit for disinformation began in the wake of that 2016 EU referendum.\n\nSince then the company has faced major political scrutiny over how it accelerates disinformation \u2014 and has responded by creating a degree of transparency on political ads, launching an archive where this type of advert can be searched. But that appears as far as Facebook is willing to go on tackling the malicious propaganda problem its platform accelerates.\n\nIn the US, senator Elizabeth Warren has been duking it out publicly with Facebook on the same point as Collins rather more directly \u2014 by running ads on Facebook saying it\u2019s endorsing Trump by supporting his lies.\n\nThere\u2019s no sign of Facebook backing down, though. On the contrary. A recent leak from an internal meeting saw founder Mark Zuckerberg attacking Warren as an \u201cexistential\u201d threat to the company. While, this week, Bloomberg reports that Facebook\u2019s executive has been quietly advising a Warren rival for the Democratic nomination, Pete Buttigieg, on campaign hires.\n\nSo a company that hires politicians to senior roles, advises high profile politicians on election campaigns, tweaks its policy on political ads after a closed door meeting with the current holder of the office of US president, Donald Trump, and ignores internal calls to robustly police political ads, is rapidly sloughing off any residual claims to be \u2018just a technology company\u2019. (Though, really, we knew that already.)\n\nIn the letter Collins also presses Facebook on its plan to rollout end-to-end encryption across its messaging app suite, asking why it can\u2019t limit the tech to WhatsApp only \u2014 something the UK government has also been pressing it on this month.\n\nHe also raises questions about Facebook\u2019s access to metadata \u2014 asking whether it will use inferences gleaned from the who, when and where of e2e encrypted comms (even though it can\u2019t access the what) to target users with ads.\n\nFacebook\u2019s self-proclaimed \u2018pivot to privacy\u2018 \u2014 when it announced earlier this year a plan to unify its separate messaging platforms onto a single e2e encrypted backend \u2014 has been widely interpreted as an attempt to make it harder for antitrust regulators to break up its business empire, as well as a strategy to shirk responsibility for content moderation by shielding itself from much of the substance that flows across its platform while retaining access to richer cross-platform metadata so it can continue to target users with ads\u2026", "description": "In yet another letter seeking to pry accountability from Facebook, the chair of a British parliamentary committee has pressed the company over its decision to adopt a policy on political ad that supports flagrant lying.
