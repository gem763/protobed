With him on the 30-man shortlist are Alisson, Roberto Firmino, Giorginio Wijnaldum, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Sadio Mane and Mo Salah.\n\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says his seven players deserve to be nominated for Ballon d\u2019Or\n\nLiverpool and Holland defender Virgil van Dijk has been shortlisted for the Ballon d'Or award\n\nAnd Klopp does not think this will be the final time on his watch Liverpool have such a healthy representation. Having won the Champions League in June, there is a determination to defend their title in Istanbul next May. If they do that, Klopp knows further recognition will be forthcoming.\n\n\u2018It is a very good sign after last season and how we played,\u2019 said Klopp, who will shuffle his starting line-up in Genk on Wednesday night.\n\n\u2018It is normal that a lot of players have to be nominated if there are football experts. Is this about playing in a specific tournament? Yes, it is important. Our seven players are all deserved. If it is a sign that we are a destination, I do not know. We will see. It looks like we are comfortable with each other. We want to work together for the next couple of years or more but we will see what the future brings.\u2019\n\nLiverpool star Sadio Mane is among the names on the 30-man shortlist for Ballon d'Or prize\n\nLiverpool\u2019s opening performances in Europe have been scratchy. They won the trophy last season after losing all three away group games and this campaign began with another away defeat in Naples.\n\nKlopp, who will make a late check on Salah\u2019s fitness following an ankle injury which kept him out of Sunday\u2019s draw at Manchester United, is respectful of the threat carried by Belgian champions Genk and has made it clear that Liverpool will not get away with further mistakes on the road, as they seek a first group-stage away win since October 2017 in Maribor.\n\n\u2018Last year we were lucky with how tight the group was,\u2019 said Klopp.\n\nLiverpool striker Mohamed Salah was also included on the 30-man shortlist on Monday night\n\n\u2018That will not happen this year. We know it\u2019s not historically good what we have done (in the away group games) in the last few years but in general the Champions League was obviously really good.We know we have to improve and we try again and again and again until it works out.\u2019\n\nHowever, one of Liverpool\u2019s best performances of 2019 came when the pressure was on in the Allianz Stadium and club vice-captain James Milner said: \u2018Bayern Munich stands out as a good result away. A massive win against one of the best teams in Europe.\n\n\u2018We go into every game wanting to win. We haven\u2019t been good enough away from home, that\u2019s the simple fact, but we want to put it right.\u2019", "description": "Jurgen Klopp believes Liverpool's septet of Ballon d'Or nominees is the surest indication his club have re-established themselves as a leading European force.", "authors": ["Dominic King For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/23/20058532-0-image-a-14_1571782373384.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
