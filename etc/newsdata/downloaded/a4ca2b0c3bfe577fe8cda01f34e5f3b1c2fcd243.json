Fifteen years is a long time, catching every day. I got to play in my hometown.\u201d\n\nMcCann, from Duluth High School in the Atlanta area, played his first nine seasons with the Braves. Following three seasons with the New York Yankees and two with Houston, McCann returned to Atlanta to renew a friendship with Braves manager Brian Snitker that began in the minors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Snit for a long time, since he was a Double-A manager,\u201d the seven-time All-Star said. \u201cI enjoyed the chance to do this with him.\u201d\n\nMcCann won a World Series title with Houston in 2017 but couldn\u2019t realize his dream of helping to bring Atlanta its second championship.\n\n\u201cThis organization is where it needs to be going into the future,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got so much talent. I\u2019m really proud I got to put this uniform on again.\u201d\n\nMcCann\u2019s announcement produced a quick response from former teammate Chipper Jones, who tweeted McCann is \u201cthe best out there\u201d and \u201cone of my favorite teammates ever.\u201d\n\nJones described McCann as \u201ca true pro, a leader of men, a great father and a best friend!\u201d\n\nMcCann started in every game of the series but hit only .188. He was only one part of the middle of the Braves\u2019 lineup that struggled against Cardinals pitching.\n\nMcCann\u2019s final regular season was more productive. He hit .249 - his highest average since 2013 - with 12 homers and 45 RBIs while he shared playing time with Tyler Flowers.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a part of this team, to be back home and play in front of my family every night,\u201d McCann said, adding he didn\u2019t think he would change his mind on ending his playing career.\n\nMcCann ranks fifth in Atlanta history with 236 doubles, sixth with 706 RBIs, seventh with 1,139 hits and eighth with 188 home runs. Overall, he hit .262 with 282 homers.\n\n\u201cI went to high school here, I grew up here, I got to play nine years here to start my career,\u201d he said. \u201cI got to play with some of my heroes growing up and coming back to play with a new generation, I\u2019d say it was a success.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Brian McCann's Atlanta homecoming didn't end the way he hoped.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Charles Odum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/nlds_braves_cardinals_baseball_56926_c0-191-4571-2856_s1770x1032.jpg?836d6f250e8752ca4395d9d542e65fd10d4c440f", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
