Today, that enthusiasm has spilt over into the stock markets.\n\nChinese blockchain A-share firms max out\n\nOn Monday, stocks in Chinese blockchain A-share firms maxed out at their 10% limit. Co-founder of crypto investment holding firm Primitive Ventures Dovey Wan tweeted out:\n\nas expected, almost ALL (over 100) Blockchain-related Chinese A-shares hit the daily upper limit (10% intraday gain) New money in China will first hit the stock to follow on the Xi/Blockchain news, and later ______ pic.twitter.com/sC5IZgAojo \u2014 Dovey \u4ee5\u5fb7\u670d\u4eba Wan \ud83d\udddd \ud83e\udd96 (@DoveyWan) October 28, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nThis massive influx of capital into blockchain comes after the technology was endorsed by China\u2019s most influential figure. Last week, he spoke out in favour of the new technology, calling it a breakthrough.\n\n\u201cWe must take blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies, clarify the main directions, increase investment, focus on a number of key technologies, and accelerate the development of blockchain and industrial innovation.\u201d\n\nThe crypto markets subsequently spiked, seemingly sparked by the fact that China is officially all-in on blockchain technology.\n\nAlthough, as several people have pointed out, Xi was quick to say \u201cblockchain\u201d and not \u201cBitcoin\u201d. The likes of Coinmetrics.io co-founder Nic Carter even downplayed the news, asking:\n\nSo just because xi jinping said \u201cblockchain\u201d were all gonna pretend that it means something? \u2014 nic carter (@nic__carter) October 25, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s far more likely that he was talking about centralised blockchains to track movements further rather than offer citizens economic freedom or self-sovereignty. As economist, trader, and influencer in the space Alex Kruger pointed out:\n\nAssume China's president has private blockchains in mind. Blockchain, not crypto. Control and surveillance, not freedom and privacy. https://t.co/Az6haBQAd9 \u2014 Alex Kr\u00fcger (@krugermacro) October 25, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nChinese banks to increase usage of blockchain for finance\n\nBeyond the explosion in the stock market, the head of technology at the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) is also getting in on the game. He has urged Chinese banks to step up their use of blockchain for digital finance, according to a Reuters report today.\n\nIt appears as if interest in the technology is catching on everywhere. According to data from WeChat, the search volume for both blockchain and Bitcoin has spiked. Two days ago, the number of searches for \u201cblockchain\u201d was at 777,000. After the Xi Jinping endorsement, they reached a massive 9.2 million.\n\nWeChat searches (10/23/19):\n\n\u2013 \u533a\u5757\u94fe (Blockchain): 777K\n\n\u2013 \u6bd4\u7279\u5e01 (Bitcoin): 572K WeChat searches (10/25/19):\n\n\u2013 \u533a\u5757\u94fe (Blockchain): 9.2MM\n\n\u2013 \u6bd4\u7279\u5e01 (Bitcoin): 1.3MM Incredible! pic.twitter.com/gXvqEQOmVn \u2014 Cole Kennelly \u2b19 \ud83e\udd84 (@ColeGotTweets) October 27, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth Chinese blockchain projects NEO and Tron made staggering gains as well. NEO skyrocketed by 45% while Tron gained almost 25% on the news.\n\nBinance CEO says the exchange will \u2018scale up\u2019 operations\n\nUpon the news of the blockchain stocks maxing out, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) confirmed that the crypto exchange will be scaling up and is waiting for the \u201cgains in the stock markets\u201d to \u201cspill over to crypto\u201d.\n\nThose gains in stock markets will spill over to crypto soon\u2026 Told ours guys to scale up system capacity, waiting. https://t.co/8S0LhCXoV3 \u2014 CZ Binance (@cz_binance) October 28, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nThe timing couldn\u2019t have come better for Facebook\u2019s chief Mark Zuckerberg as well. Standing in front of an antagonistic and at times bloodthirsty US Congress, he claimed regulators should push Libra forward or else China would steam ahead.\n\n\u201cWhile we debate these issues, the rest of the world isn\u2019t waiting. China is moving quickly to launch similar ideas in the coming months. If America doesn\u2019t innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed.\u201d\n\nIt seems as if President Xi Jinping was listening.\n\nThe post Binance to \u2018scale up\u2019 capacity based on China blockchain fever appeared first on Coin Rivet.", "description": "After Chinese President Xi Jinping's endorsement of blockchain technology last week, the crypto markets rallied spectacularly.
