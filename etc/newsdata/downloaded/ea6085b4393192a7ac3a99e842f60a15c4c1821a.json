Still, overall the is trading lower, weighed down by struggling investment firms and airlines.\n\nChina economic data upsets Asian markets\n\nAsian markets proved equally cautious, upset more by comments from the Chinese Premier than the rally in oil prices. Premier Li Keqiang warned that it will be very difficult for China to grow at 6% or more this year given the current state of the global economy and his predictions were further borne out by the country\u2019s data which was released later and showed a slowdown to the slowest rate since the early 1990s of only 4.4%, significantly below expectations of 5.2%.\n\nUK September slip\n\nBrexit turmoil has squeezed UK house sellers into a corner, causing prices to slip by a small margin in a move that is very untypical for September when prices normally rally after the market gets back into full swing following summer holidays. However, buyers remain hesitant while the political situation remains unresolved causing September prices to drop on an annual basis for the first time in nine years.\n\nWith the Parliament closed for the next few weeks and speculation about possible outcomes when it reopens reaching fever pitch, there is little to support the pound in the meantime. Sterling has slipped nearly half a percent against the dollar and is weaker 0.36% against the common currency; there are no signs that there will be any turn around in this trend for the moment.\n\nDisclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
