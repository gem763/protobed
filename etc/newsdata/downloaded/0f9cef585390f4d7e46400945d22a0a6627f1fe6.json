They sat in the visitors room for a few hours and spoke.\" However, seeing her mother in her dark green prison jumpsuit was \"hard for Georgia.\"\n\nIn May, Huffman pleaded guilty to paying admissions consultant Rick Singer $15,000 to have a test proctor boost her older daughter Sophia\u2019s SAT score. Huffman was sentenced to 14 days in prison, plus a $30,000 fine, one year of supervised release and 250 hours of community service. Huffman reported to prison early \u2014 on Oct. 15 \u2014 and is expected to be released on Oct. 27.\n\nFederal prosecutors alleged that Huffman discussed running the same scheme with Singer for Georgia. And Macy, who wasn\u2019t charged in the scandal dubbed Operation Varsity Blues, allegedly had a phone call with Singer to discuss the process. However, they didn\u2019t pursue it.", "description": "\u201cGet it u guys?
