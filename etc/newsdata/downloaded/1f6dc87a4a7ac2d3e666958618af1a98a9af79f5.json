The global growth outlook cannot take any more angst in the US and China relationship.\n\nThe grim September ISM survey \u2013 it fell to 47.8 from 49.1 in August \u2013 highlighted the threat to the US economy from the weak global growth, lacklustre trade and a strong US dollar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tough times in the US industrial economy speaks to another point of concern: has the US Federal Reserve acted boldly enough with two cuts in as many meetings to underwrite growth in the world's largest economy?\n\nBNY Mellon FX and macro strategist John Velis said the employment component of the ISM sends a negative signal about the prospects for the US jobs market. This will test the US central bank, which has signalled it's in no rush to ease monetary policy again.\n\n\"This reinforces our view that while the Fed is still stubbornly clinging to its view that rates are currently appropriate for an economy that continues to perform well, it will ultimately have to accept that the pillars of support \u2013 the labor market and the consumer \u2013 are weakening,\" said Velis.\n\nTrump v Powell\n\nFutures markets priced in a 60 per cent chance of another 25 basis point cut at the Federal Reserve's October meeting after the ISM numbers, up from 40 per cent beforehand.\n\nIf it wasn't bad enough that traders are betting the Fed will need to cut again, Fed chair Jerome Powell received yet another dose of constructive criticism from President Trump who said the central bank doesn't \"have a clue\" and was \"pathetic\".\n\nUnfortunately, Trump's crash or crash-through approach may have worked in New York's 1980s property scene, but in a world looking for certainty and clarity it's little wonder that the smart money are worried.", "description": "The boss of the world's largest hedge fund says all investors \"need to worry\" about capital flow retributions becoming a new weapon in the trade war.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b39113b190dadaf00ca42893ad5b6fb68fe398ea", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
