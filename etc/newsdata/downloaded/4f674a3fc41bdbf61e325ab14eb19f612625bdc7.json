The Ryman was home to the Grand Ole Opry from 1943 to 1974, and has returned there in winter months since 1999. (Mark Humphrey/AP)\n\nJeff Manuel is an associate professor of history at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville and the author of \" Taconite Dreams: The Struggle to Sustain Mining on Minnesota\u2019s Iron Range, 1915-2000 .\"\n\nKen Burns\u2019s latest documentary, \u201cCountry Music,\u201d begins tonight. Over eight episodes, Burns and his production team tell country music\u2019s story from its roots in the 1920s through the mainstream success of artists like Garth Brooks in the 1990s. In showcasing the history of this quintessentially American genre, the series will no doubt feature the music of figures like Jimmie Rodgers, Hank Williams, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and Merle Haggard.\n\nBut it will do more than replay the music of cherished favorites. It will also make an argument about who and what counts as country music \u2014 a process that has, until now, privileged the genre\u2019s connection to rural Southern white culture over a more complex but more accurate history of country music\u2019s multiracial roots in the past century.\n\nMore than other popular music genres, country music journalists, radio and fans police the genre\u2019s boundaries in ways that keep country music stubbornly white and focused on mass market audiences. Most recently, Lil Nas X\u2019s smash hit \u201cOld Town Road\u201d was removed from Billboard\u2019s Hot Country chart because, it claimed, the song \u201cdoes not embrace enough elements of today\u2019s country music.\u201d\n\nBut country music\u2019s fans and artists also assert control of the genre by carefully shaping the historical narrative of the music. And while Burns commendably emphasizes the contributions of African Americans and women to country music, he used artists and fans to construct his historical narrative, foregrounding the perspectives of participants, rather than the work of scholars who have explored the genre\u2019s roots and history. Explaining why he skipped historians, Burns said: \u201cWhat we found early on is that with country music, the people themselves understood the history. They protected it.\u201d\n\nBut privileging the voices of country\u2019s most successful artists is very different from showcasing an accurate understanding of its history, and this narrow view of country music\u2019s history has made it difficult to understand the genre as a rich, complex art form that was not strictly rural, white or aimed at a mass market.\n\nCountry music has always battled over control of its historical narrative. Before World War II, folklorists and ethnomusicologists who traveled the American South collected songs. They sought out the \u201cplain white folk\u201d of the South and believed country music emerged organically from their culture. Resulting from their own biases and assumptions, these early scholars retroactively gave the new genre of country music a white, rural history that belied the rich interracial and cross-class mixing that spawned the music.\n\nCertain songs, stories and recordings were selected, preserved and amplified by researchers who believed that white Southerners were \u201ca lost tonal tribe in America.\u201d But in the process, similar songs by black Southerners were dismissed as derivatives of white originals and not seen as influential in shaping the music\u2019s roots.\n\nCountry musicians have also advanced these biases. While they have valuable insight on their own careers, their perspective on the genre\u2019s history should be treated skeptically. Consider one of the artists Burns uses to narrate the genre\u2019s history in his docuseries: Merle Haggard.\n\nWhile songs like \u201cMama Tried\u201d and \u201cSing Me Back Home\u201d are canonical in country music\u2019s history, Haggard was himself an unreliable historical narrator. In his first autobiography (yes, country musicians often write multiple autobiographies), Haggard admitted that he was so tired of talking about his past that he started fabricating his own history and waiting to see how long it took for the made-up stories to get back to him. Consumers and scholars of country music longed to hear authentic stories about musicians\u2019 roots \u2014 an expectation that musicians like Haggard could manipulate.\n\nHaggard is best-known for 1969\u2019s \u201cOkie from Muskogee,\u201d a song that became a conservative backlash anthem in the late 1960s. Conservatives seized the song as an authentic representation of the \u201cSilent Majority\u201d of white Americans who rejected the counterculture. But Haggard was cryptic about the song\u2019s meaning. At times he said it was written as a parody and other times he stood by the song\u2019s patriotic message. Instead of seeing Haggard as a reliable guide to country music\u2019s past, he might better be considered a shape-shifter in the mold of Bob Dylan, an artist who toyed with audiences\u2019 desire for authenticity.\n\nThe skewed perception formed by unreliable narrators like Haggard and misunderstandings of country\u2019s early roots have had a significant negative impact. Failing to acknowledge country music\u2019s multiracial origins has made it difficult to shake the perception that it is a genre by and for white people. But historical research over the past 25 years has shown a different reality.\n\nSince the early 20th century, a musician\u2019s race has defined their inclusion in the genre as much as the music itself. Music by black artists was labeled \u201crace music\u201d while nearly identical music by white artists was categorized as \u201chillbilly,\u201d a precursor to country. Violations of music\u2019s color line were treated harshly. In 1927, Columbia Records mistakenly released songs by the Allen Brothers, who were white, under the label\u2019s race records series. The Allen Brothers sued Columbia \u201cfor damaging their reputation\u201d and moved to a new record label, a story told by historian Patrick Huber.\n\nThese distinctions began with the color line of the Jim Crow South, but they later channeled radio playlists, record catalogues and entire genres into grooves defined by race. Even today, black and white artists in country, hip-hop and R&B strain against racialized genres. Linking race and genre involved decisions by record labels, but it also developed out of historical narratives told about country\u2019s origins and who counted as a legitimate country musician.\n\nTonight\u2019s start of the documentary provides an opportunity to tell a more inclusive story about country music\u2019s past, and Burns says the series will emphasize the \u201cAfrican American mentors or influences\u201d behind country music\u2019s founding figures. Featured prominently is Rhiannon Giddens, an exceptionally talented bluegrass and Americana musician who has done more than anyone to highlight country\u2019s multiracial roots. But Burns\u2019s reliance on musicians rather than historians to tell the story of country music upholds a flawed narrative that overlooks country music\u2019s deeper legacies of racism.\n\nCountry music itself has tried to downplay the history of segregation that shaped its commercial explosion in the late 20th century and its present position as one of America\u2019s favorite genres. Select historical narratives have played a key role in creating a seamless mythology that country music offers simple songs about the emotional lives of rural white Americans, at the expense of a richer, more complex history about country music\u2019s multiracial and historically specific origins. As Burns\u2019s \u201cCountry Music\u201d begins, viewers should watch with an awareness that the series is not just recounting country music\u2019s history but also telling the latest version of an old story of who\u2019s in and who\u2019s out of the genre.\n\nCountry music emphasizes its authenticity and simplicity, saying it is little more than \u201cthree chords and the truth.\u201d Historians know that the real truth is much more complex.", "description": "The popular genre's history is complex, multiracial \u2014 and segregated.", "authors": ["Jeff Manuel", "Jeff Manuel Is An Associate Professor Of History At Southern Illinois University Edwardsville", "The Author Of", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/J8401kSeHpf7KCYeHHLyRyHT1eY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SS6W2GSRR4I6TPNXIT4URTAGAU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
