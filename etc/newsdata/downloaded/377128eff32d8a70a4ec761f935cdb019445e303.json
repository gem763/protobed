Haha, just kidding. Everyone knows the Hunger Games \u2014 a series of books and movies about a government that separates children from their families and lets them die in federal custody \u2014 is fiction. Actually, Ivanka\u2019s traveling around South America to promote her women\u2019s economic empowerment initiatives. On her tour, she stopped in Colombia, where she met with Vice-President Marta Luc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, and wore what appeared to be a live, oversize succulent. Maybe a very large jade plant, or a Portulacaria afra, I think.\n\nOr perhaps it\u2019s actually some sort of frilled-neck lizard, like the one that kills Newman in Jurassic Park, because as later photos from the event show, unless they\u2019re provoked by a potential predator, the sleeves usually hang down demurely.\n\nPhoto: Guillermo Legaria Schweizer/Getty Images\n\nThis is not Ivanka\u2019s first official trip to Central and South America. In April 2018, she visited Peru to talk about women\u2019s empowerment initiatives at the Summit of the America\u2019s, but not before stopping to learn all about quinoa.\n\nThis week, Ivanka is also scheduled to visit Argentina and Paraguay to promote the administration\u2019s new Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, which was established earlier this year.\n\nOver the course of the trip, she will likely require minimal watering, but plenty of sunlight.\n\nStay in touch.
