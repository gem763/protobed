It showed the at R15.1717, with the expected trend to be that we break lower to R14.85-14.64 in the coming days, provided R15.34 was not broken above. (click to enlarge our forecast below)\n\nUSDZAR Short term Outlook\n\nAnd so our subscribers went into the week with some clues as to what the days ahead would bring...\n\nAnd boy, didn't we need that, with a tumultuous week of events creating more noise than ever. Here are some of the biggest headlines:\n\nGDP revival - out of nowhere, SA's GDP was flying high again to avoid a technical recession a huge turnaround\n\n- out of nowhere, SA's GDP was flying high again to avoid a technical recession a huge turnaround - after 13 straight weeks of protests, there was finally some backing off from the government as we saw some of the protestors demands answered\n\nTrade War updates - and surprisingly, some say that the Trade War had more to do with Hong Kong than we realize, as we saw things turning to the positive again between the US and China\n\n- and surprisingly, some say that the Trade War had more to do with Hong Kong than we realize, as we saw things turning to the positive again between the US and China chaos - as for Britain and its exit...wow. It was an incredible week, as the tables kept on turning on Boris Johnson\n\nSo, first things first...\n\nThe Rand opened around R15.22 to begin the week, and actually gained ground toward the South African market open despite the latest Trade War news which had come over the weekend - with President Trump adding more tariffs.\n\nIt was certainly one of the more interesting weeks in the Trade War as we saw a couple of key elements playing out between the US Tariffs, China's economy and the Hong Kong situation.\n\nPresident Xi is not normally one to compromise, but has been forced into a corner by the situation in Hong Kong to finally allow the Hong Kong extradition bill to be taken off the table.\n\nThis means that one of the demands of the millions of protesters has now been met, and while this is not a complete solution, it was their biggest demand.\n\nThis then combined with the latest news on China's economic growth made for some very interesting reading, as predictions are seen heading for sub 6% in 2019, thanks mainly to the Trade War...\n\n...this was not helped by President Trump lumping further tariffs onto China of another 15% on $110bn worth of goods.\n\nAnd so the perfect storm continued for China...and the net result is that the US and China have agreed to create favourable conditions ahead of their trade talks in October (with threats to increase tariffs still in place of course).\n\nThe feeling that comes out of the week is that President Xi has had to lessen his demands through the difficulties which China is now facing...\n\n..perhaps a real resolution on the horizon?\n\nPresident Xi's tight position was confirmed on Friday by China cutting its cash reserve ratio from 13.5% by 0.5% to 13.0%, and being forced to inject $126bn into its slowing economy...interesting times!\n\nSo, all in all, a positive week when it came to Trade War news, which was Rand-positive for sure...\n\n...which brings us to some of the other Rand-Positive news: SA's GDP\n\nSeemingly out of nowhere, SA's GDP sprung to life on Tuesday with a massive turnaround for Q2 of positive 3.1% growth! This was mainly in the mining sector, which has been a thorn in the flesh for a long time - so a massive and important turnaround for the country's growth.\n\nFollowing this news, SARB governor's view was a confident one, with him being hopeful of an economic turnaround following the excellent GDP results.\n\nInterestingly enough, the Rand's reaction to this was fairly muted - proving again that you cannot rely on news events to trigger massive moves.\n\nRands Prediction Movement\n\nRaging on amongst all of this news was Brexit, which had almost too much happening to keep track of. In short however (to the best of our understanding):\n\nBoris Johnson tried to ensure Britain leaves the EU at the end of October, deal or no deal. This motion was blocked, and by the end of the day, British MPs had taken control of parliament to push for a definite solution to a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThis was business-positive according to the general public - but that is debatable depending which side of the fence you stand.\n\nBoris Johnson was very unimpressed with this, and he suggested that if the Labour party doesn't want Brexit, then he will have an election on October 15, before the Brexit deadline...\n\n...this motion was also rejected and voted down. Leaving everything basically just as uncertain as it began.\n\nAnother election would effectively be a Second Referendum on Brexit, giving the final yay or nay from the now (hopefully) more informed public.\n\nAs for the Pound in amongst all of this, it had a jittery week against the Rand, but made a good recovery vs the USD:\n\nPound Recovery Vs Rand & USD\n\nAs for other news headlines, there was plenty in the economic figures:\n\nSA Current Account deficit worsened to 4% instead of the expected 3%, countering against the positive GDP news...\n\nGlobally, the US ISM manufacturing index dropped to 49.1 points. This is first time since 2016 that the index has dropped below 50 points, which is the tipping point between contraction and expansion.\n\nUS Non farm payroll added 130k jobs vs the 165k expected. Hourly earnings rose 3.2% while unemployment held steady at 3.7%.\n\nAs for the Rand, we saw one of the best week's in recent months, with the local currency gaining all of 50c during the course of the 5 days, to turn the tide on the resilient Dollar...\n\n...this has been a long time coming, and was exactly as per our forecast from the previous Friday, as we saw the market track down into the low R14.70s, before closing the week around R14.80.\n\nAnd that was the wrap!\n\nThe Week Ahead (9-13 Sept 2019)\n\nWell, after an interesting week, there are plenty of prospects ahead of us in the next 5 days:\n\nAnother Brexit vote sometime on Monday\n\nECB Interest & Deposit Rate Decisions\n\nUS Retail Sales\n\nAnd then we will wait to hear of any further updates on the Trade War and the yet to be concluded Hong Kong\n\nSo expect a bumpy ride, folks!\n\nBig question: How is this likely to impact the Rand?\n\nAnd again, our simple answer is, we do not try and decipher the news or fundamentals to give us direction. We simply let the market itself tell us what is happening, by analyzing the patterns of sentiment .\n\nApplying the Elliott Wave Principle (the study of human behaviour in financial markets) to the market provides us with the best guess as to where the market is likely to be headed - much better than anything else we know.\n\nSo, as you saw in the review above, a forecast based on an objective analysis gives us something valuable and actionable. As opposed to gut feel, which leaves us indecisive.\n\nLook forward to sharing my outlook with you.\n\nTo your success~\n\nJames Paynter\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Forex Analysis by James Paynter covering: USD/ZAR, BTC/ZAR.
