The Smart Set collection, comprising a trouser suit, white shirt, dress and a leather bag, goes beyond awareness raising with an ambitious plan to improve the quantity and quality of clothing stock at the charity. For each piece sold on the shop floor one will be donated to Smart Works.\n\nHow Meghan's workwear collection will help women into work Read more\n\nThe launch was also something of a celebration of Meghan\u2019s image as the modern \u201crelatable\u201d face of the royal family. The duchess, who wore jeans to Wimbledon and is said to have the weekly shop delivered by Ocado rather than Harrods, reminded the audience that almost exactly a year ago she had launched the Together cookbook with the women of the Hubb Community Kitchen who were affected by the Grenfell tower fire.\n\n\u201cToday is about fashion not food, but this is a similar project because both have women helping women at their core,\u201d she said. She was joined on stage by Smart Works staff and clients, who recalled her \u201creally getting stuck in\u201d as a volunteer, putting together outfits and regaling clients with tales of her own first job serving frozen yogurt over the counter in Los Angeles.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The duchess seen during a photo shoot for the Smart Set collection.

It was a nice jacket, but I thought to myself, these women need and deserve to feel their best not just to wear whatever hasn\u2019t sold at the end of the season,\u201d the duchess said at the launch.\n\nSo, she said, she approached her friend and designer Misha Nonoo, the retailers John Lewis and Marks & Spencer (chosen \u201cbecause I have worn a lot of their clothes since I moved to the UK\u201d), and also the Jigsaw chain because she was \u201creally touched\u201d by the message \u201cin celebration of immigrant culture in this country\u201d of the brand\u2019s award-winning Love Immigration campaign. That Smart Set would be sold through several rival retailers was, said Meghan, \u201canother layer to this communal success story\u201d.\n\nThe royal connection and Meghan\u2019s reputation as an elegant and stylish dresser, could drive sales. At the launch the duchess reported she had just been told that the \u00a3109 John Lewis bag was already sold out online.\n\nJill Stanton, the women\u2019s and children\u2019s director at Marks & Spencer, where the machine-washable Smart Set tunic dress will retail at \u00a319.50, said: \u201cBy offering our customers the opportunity to purchase a dress and gift one to a Smart Works client, together we are empowering and supporting women.\u201d\n\nJigsaw\u2019s Smart Set suit has wool-blend trousers at \u00a3120 and a matching Italian stretch gabardine blazer for \u00a3199. \u201cPieces like these make a woman feel ready to face the day,\u201d said Louise Long, the head of womenswear buying at Jigsaw.\n\nA spokesperson for the duchess said she had been involved in the design process. The collection\u2019s minimalist aesthetic reflects the personal style of a woman who wore a black trouser suit rather than a gown to her first official evening engagement with Prince Harry and sparked a frenzy for Nonoo\u2019s \u201cHusband\u201d classic white shirt when she wore one to the Invictus Games in 2017.\n\n\u201cThere is often a misunderstanding about Smart Works being a makeover, a fashion show of \u2018before and after\u2019,\u201d the duchess wrote in Vogue when she was guest editor last month. \u201cBut \u2026 this is not a fairytale. In fact, if it\u2019s a cultural reference you\u2019re after, forget Cinderella \u2013 this is the story of Wonder Woman, ready to take on the world in her metaphorical and literal cape.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Patron of Smart Works charity at launch of collection meant to help women at job interviews", "authors": ["Jess Cartner-Morley", "Archie Bland"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/150bfb306b094a4d9fcd365b7563d35dd193e245/0_80_3720_2232/master/3720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=adf1d6b809013c77815c9d6e7d62ac7f", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
