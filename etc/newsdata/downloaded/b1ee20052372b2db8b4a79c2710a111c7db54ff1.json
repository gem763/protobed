I\u2019m not waiting for them (to) either.\u201d\n\nRutgers coach Chris Ash is in the early stages of a crucial fourth season in charge, having won just eight of his first 37 games with the Scarlet Knights. Rutgers appeared to be in trouble again when UMass jumped ahead 21-7 last week, but the Scarlet Knights closed the game on a 41-0 run.\n\nThe Hawkeyes won\u2019t be so easy to brush aside.\n\nRutgers is 0-15 against ranked Big Ten opponents since joining the league, and it finished 2018 on an 11-game losing streak. Still, Ash was pleased with his team\u2019s resilience after falling into a 14-point hole.\n\n\u201cWe found out a lot about our team,\u201d Ash said. \u201cTo be able to handle some adversity the way we did told us a lot about our football team.\u201d\n\nSTANLEY\u2019S TIME\n\nIowa senior quarterback Nate Stanley had a sterling debut, completing 21 of 30 passes for 252 yards and three touchdowns - to three different receivers - with zero interceptions. Stanley, in his third season as the starter, has 55 career TD passes against just 16 picks.\n\n\u201cNate works at it so hard, he\u2019s extremely conscientious that way, and he\u2019s got good mental toughness,\u201d Ferentz said. \u201cHopefully this is his most productive and enjoyable season of his career.\u201d\n\nTHE CARTER III\n\nTexas Tech transfer McLane Carter gave Rutgers an enormous boost behind center by throwing for 340 yards and a pair of touchdowns against the Minutemen. But he also threw three picks.\n\n\u201cBiggest thing coming out of Friday night offensively is just the three interceptions. We haven\u2019t had it. We have to eliminate it,\u201d Ash said.\n\nRutgers\u2018 quarterbacks were abysmal in 2018, ranking last nationally with a passer rating of 78.8 and with just five TD throws against 22 interceptions.\n\nIOWA\u2019S DEFENSE\n\nIowa, which ranked 11th in the country allowing just 17.8 points per game a year ago, picked up right where it left off. Despite communication issues that helped lead to a pair of TDs, eight of Miami\u2019s 10 drives ended with either a punt or an interception last week.\n\nPACHECO-MATE\n\nRutgers sophomore Isaih Pacheco ran for 156 yards and four touchdowns against UMass, becoming the only player nationally to score from the ground four times in the opener. Pacheco ranked second on the Scarlet Knights in 2018 with 910 all-purpose yards.\n\nHE SAID IT\n\n\u201cIt was unreal. It\u2019s been a dream of mine to play college football here.\u201d - Iowa sophomore walk-on guard Kyler Schott, who has unexpectedly blossomed into a starter after receiving zero NCAA offers coming out of high school.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Iowa's matchup against Rutgers on Saturday will be the earliest Big Ten game the Hawkeyes have ever played and coach Kirk Ferentz isn't exactly thrilled about it.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Luke Meredith"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/31/miami_ohio_iowa_football_36741_c0-232-5526-3453_s1770x1032.jpg?0b6d2f0cfc25968d8d2f9622ec1e4aa62dab7cba", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
