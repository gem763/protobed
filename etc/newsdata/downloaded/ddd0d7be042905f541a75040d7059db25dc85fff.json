Trump congratulated Xi Tuesday on the 70th anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday ripped the Federal Reserve after a weak manufacturing report and congratulated the People\u2019s Republic of China on its 70-year anniversary even as Republicans condemned it.\n\nFED\n\nAfter a survey showed the U.S. manufacturing sector posted its biggest contraction in September since the end of the 2007-2009 recession, Trump said the Fed and its Chairman Jerome Powell were the culprit.\n\nRead: U.S. manufacturers experience worst month since 2007-2009 Great Recession, ISM finds.\n\nHe said Powell and the central bank \u201chave allowed the Dollar to get so strong, especially relative to ALL other currencies, that our manufacturers are being negatively affected. Fed Rate too high. They are their own worst enemies, they don\u2019t have a clue. Pathetic!\u201d\n\nTrump has pressed the Fed to cut rates aggressively.

The call is at the heart of Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe.\n\nNow read: Trump campaign spent as much as $2 million on impeachment ads on Facebook, researcher finds.\n\nSign up for Trump Today and more MarketWatch newsletters.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday ripped the Federal Reserve after a weak U.S. manufacturing report and congratulated the People\u2019s Republic of China on its...", "authors": ["Robert Schroeder", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GH642_trump__ZG_20180419111126.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
