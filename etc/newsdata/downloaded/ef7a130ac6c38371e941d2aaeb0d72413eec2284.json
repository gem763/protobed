Euronews looks at the climate change movement", "language": "en", "text": "Pledging to use non-violent civil disobedience as a weapon to wage their battles, Extinction Rebellion began in 2018.\n\nThey attracted more than 1,500 people to London's Parliament Square where they first declared a 'rebellion'.\n\nSince then, the social movement has spread rapidly throughout the world, organising protests in over 70 countries.\n\nIn protests that began on October 7, London's Metropolitan Police said that at least 1000 people had been arrested in London.\n\nEuronews takes a look at this international movement.\n\nWhat is Extinction Rebellion?\n\nIt is a self-described international social movement that uses civil disobedience to pressure governments to take action on the \"climate and ecological emergency\".\n\n\"Campaigning as usual hasn't worked, and so we are using non-violent civil disobedience. We are disrupting roads; we are occupying sites so that our voices are heard and so that governments take action,\" said Extinction Rebellion political strategist Ronan Harrington told Euronews.\n\nIt was first launched in 2018. A crowd of more than 1500 people gathered in London's Parliament Square and announced a \"Declaration of Rebellion\" against the UK government.\n\nThe decentralised and volunteer-led organisation encourages people to set up local groups in their towns. They organise large scale protests and actions through WhatsApp and Telegram.\n\nWhat is the social movement's goal?\n\nThe group has three demands in the United Kingdom, where they were founded: for the government to declare a \"climate and ecological emergency\", for the government to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2025, and for the UK to create and listen to a Citizens' Assembly on \"climate and ecological justice\".\n\nThe idea is to have citizens consult with governments on the issue of climate. Extinction Rebellion has even created a draft bill in the UK that incorporates their demands.\n\nThe movement uses arrests as a tactic to draw attention to the cause.\n\n\"Getting arrested in a core part of the Extinction Rebellion strategy because it shows just how important this issue is,\" Harrington said.\n\n\"The prisons in London are now too full to cope with the amount of people being arrested,\" Harrington added. The Metropolitan Police told Euronews that they have not yet reached full capacity during the most recent set of protests.\n\nHas the movement been successful?\n\nExtinction Rebellion brought London to a standstill in April 2019, blocking key areas of the city for 11 days. The protest resulted in over 1,000 arrests.\n\nEleven protesters even stripped off in the public gallery at the House of Commons to address the \"elephant in the room\" which they said was the climate crisis.\n\nOver the past month, protesters have sprayed fake blood on Britain's Treasury, dressed as bees in Sydney, and staged a die-in on Wall Street.\n\nA Paralympic medallist climbed atop a British Airways plane on the runway at London City airport as part of an Extinction Rebellion protest.

But sometimes an issue is so grave and that all you have left are these means to get attention that it's justified,\" Harrington said.", "description": "Extinction Rebellion is a social movement that uses nonviolent civil disobedience to draw attention to the climate crisis.", "authors": ["Lauren Chadwick"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/21/99/80/1000x563_cmsv2_2a15c09c-9126-59b7-aea1-ebbd27ecb358-4219980.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
