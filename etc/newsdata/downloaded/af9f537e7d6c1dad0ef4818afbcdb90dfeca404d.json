With all the arguments on social media and with extended family at Thanksgiving dinners, political discussions can become heated. Internet trolls come out, tempers flare and dinners get ruined.\n\n\"Typically we think of political interest and political engagement as a civic good \u2014 this is the stuff that makes democracy work,\" said Kevin Smith, a professor of political science from the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, who led the study, in conversation with Quirks & Quarks host Bob McDonald.\n\n\"At least in the current political environment, our survey seems to suggest that there potentially is a very real cost to that interest engagement.\"\n\nIf our numbers are even halfway accurate, I mean, there's tens and tens of millions of Americans who see politics as exacting a serious toll on their social emotional psychological and even physical health. - Kevin Smith, University of Nebraska, Lincoln\n\nMeasured impacts of political engagement\n\nSmith and his colleagues constructed a a survey built on questions used by Alcoholics and Gamblers Anonymous to measure the impact on gambling and alcohol on peoples feeling of wellness. They adapted the questions to look into what extent politics were causing problems in Americans' lives.\n\nThey conducted their survey on a representative sample of the U.S. adult population in March 2017 following the contentious U.S. presidential election.\n\nA protester who was wearing a media pass is restrained after interrupting the Leader of the Conservative Party Andrew Scheer as he was speaking to members of the Chambre de commerce du Montreal on Friday, Sept. 6, 2019. (Peter McCabe / THE CANADIAN PRESS)\n\nSmith said they got some \"eye-popping results\" from the people that were surveyed about how politics was affecting them, which he found shocking:\n\n40 per cent felt stressed\n\n12 per cent felt their physical health was adversely affected\n\n20 per cent were losing sleep\n\n20 per cent had a friendship damaged\n\n4 per cent experienced thoughts of suicide\n\n\"If our numbers are even halfway accurate, I mean, there's tens and tens of millions of Americans who see politics as exacting a serious toll on their social emotional psychological and even physical health,\" said Smith.\n\nImpact skewed by political affiliation\n\nThe results of this survey skewed heavily with the political spectrum. Those on the political left were more likely to report experiencing negative effects than those on the right.\n\nSmith said he'd really like to know how the results of his study would have been different if the Democrats had won the U.S. federal election.\n\n\"That's something that we're really interested in ourselves,\" said Smith.\n\nUnlike the recent protests in Hong Kong, as seen in this photo, political engagement in the U.S. and in Canada has remained relatively quite peaceful.
