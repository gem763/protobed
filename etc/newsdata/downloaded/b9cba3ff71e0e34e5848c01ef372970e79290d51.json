We all know that we have a problem. What is needed is responsible global action.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year Faure gave a groundbreaking speech from a submersible hundreds of meters below the Indian Ocean surface to highlight the fragility of one of the world\u2019s least explored ecosystems.\n\nHe said the time to act on climate change is now.\n\nFaure recently visited the British-led Nekton Mission, which earlier this year spent seven weeks surveying Seychelles waters. The island nation of fewer than 100,000 people is on track to protect almost a third of its waters by next year, a sea area larger than Germany.\n\nBut already rising water temperatures are bleaching the Seychelles\u2019 coral reefs. The increased frequency of extreme weather events is another threat.\n\nEven plastic waste poses a problem.\n\nThe UNESCO World Heritage site of Aldabra, an important turtle nesting site, receives mounds of plastic waste brought on the waves.\n\n\u201cA total of 25,750 kilograms of marine debris was collected, out of which 50,000 single flip flops,\u201d Faure said. \u201cIt just shows you the amount of pollution caused by marine debris to one of the pristine sites that we have.\u201d\n\nFor the Nekton Mission, marine scientists from the University of Oxford surveyed underwater life, mapped large areas of the sea floor and ventured deep beneath the waves with manned submersibles and remote vehicles.\n\nThe scientists plan to present their research at a summit on the state of the Indian Ocean in 2022.\n\nResearcher Paris Stefanoudis said they are \u201cpretty confident\u201d they have discovered new species, from small zooplankton to soft corals, but the discoveries are yet to be scientifically verified.\n\n\u201cThere was an incredible diversity and abundance of fish, especially in protected areas like Aldabra, which shows that marine protected areas do work when they are put in place,\u201d Stefanoudis said.\n\nResearch assistant Nico Fassbender said it is clear the Seychelles\u2019 policy of protecting its waters is working.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s reflected in the fish,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just by the amount that we see, as in there\u2019s more fish than on unprotected islands, but also because there\u2019s bigger fish, which then tells us it\u2019s a healthier ecosystem.\u201d\n\nFaure said he is hopeful the scientists\u2019 conclusions will give the international community more reason to protect marine areas.\n\n\u201cWe as a country will be in a position scientifically to say, \u2018This is how we measure and this is the difference,'\u201d he said.", "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 The Seychelles president is warning there's no time for a \"blame game\" in the fight against climate change and he urges major nations to do", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/30/c44c2d_seychelles-climate-change-91533-in-saturday-13-2019-file-photo-seychelles-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
