For students, that is. For parents, like Kate Middleton, who dropped Prince George and Princess Charlotte for their first day this morning, not so much: She recycled a look that\u2019s very familiar for any Sussex Wedding fans.\n\nDressed in a classic shirtdress with a pink floral pattern, Middleton held her daughter's hand as they approached Thomas\u2019s Battersea in London this morning.\n\nView photos Princess Charlotte's First Day Of School WPA Pool More\n\nThe dress is a Michael Michael Kors piece that was first spotted on the Duchess of Cambridge in May of last year\u2014when she attended Prince Harry and Meghan Markel\u2019s rehearsal dinner. Since it's from a past season, there aren't many styles left in stock. The ones that are, though, are on major sale: You can buy Middleton's exact same style (in a slightly different colorway) for $78, down from the original $195.\n\nIt\u2019s always an impressive move when a member of royalty recycles a party look. Not because they\u2019re suddenly like nearly every other person on the planet, who repeats clothing all the time, but because it suggests an honest endorsement for whatever they\u2019re wearing, considering that a world of options is always at their fingertips.\n\nView photos Princess Charlotte's First Day Of School WPA Pool More\n\nShe paired the Michael Michael Kors shirtdress with Prada shoes and Asprey earrings.\n\nHer exact floral dress might be nearly out of stock, but there are plenty of similar styles out there on the market.
