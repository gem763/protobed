Rogers on Impeachment: \u2018Shameful,\u2019 \u2018A Rigged Sham of an Inquiry\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "There are many questions surrounding the handling of the so-called impeachment inquiry by Democrats under the direction of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), and they \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d of the process was described as \u201cshameful\u201d by Rep. Mike Rogers (R-AL).\n\nDuring an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio\u2019s WVNN on Tuesday, Rogers raised some of those questions by noting the contradiction in the closed-door proceedings of the inquiry by the House Intelligence Committee under the direction of Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA). Rogers described the process as \u201cshameful\u201d but noted that transcripts were available to members of Congress and were not limited by secrecy.\n\n\u201cShameful, just shameful \u2014 it\u2019s political,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cEverybody knows it is. The fact that they\u2019re having these interviews behind closed doors is indefensible. This is not classified information. In fact, we were told just a little while ago that the transcripts of these interviews are available for any member of Congress to go down and read, and we can come out and talk about them. If we can come out and talk about them, then why can\u2019t they just have the things in public? Or disclose the transcripts?\u201d\n\nThe proceedings bucked impeachment precedent and according to Rogers, was done so to prevent President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers and congressional Republicans from having a more significant role in the process.\n\n\u201cThey are doing this in secret because they don\u2019t want Republicans to call their own witnesses,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey don\u2019t want us to be able to cross-examine. They don\u2019t want the president to have lawyers in the process. It\u2019s just really a rigged sham of an inquiry. It is my hope that we can get them to \u2014 if they\u2019re going to proceed with this, give us a vote on the floor just like was done with Nixon and like was done with Clinton \u2014 with fair rules that allow us to subpoena witnesses as well, call witnesses, cross-examine witnesses. [I am] just very disappointed from an institutional standpoint that the Speaker of the House has allowed this to happen.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "description": "There are many questions surrounding the handling of the so-called impeachment inquiry by Democrats under the direction of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), and they \"why\" and \"how\" of the process was described as \"shameful\" by Rep.
