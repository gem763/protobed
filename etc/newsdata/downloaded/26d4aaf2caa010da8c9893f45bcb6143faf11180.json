Her activities occurred during the same period as the contacts investigated by the former special counsel.\n\n'It's an outrage': Putin attacks 18-month prison term for Maria Butina Read more\n\nThe Russian official with whom Butina conspired was later identified as Alexander Torshin, a deputy governor of Russia\u2019s central bank. He was never charged in the case, but was hit with sanctions by the US treasury department.\n\nOne of the two Americans referenced in her case was conservative political activist Paul Erickson, her boyfriend. Erickson was not charged for his links to Butina, but was indicted on unrelated wire fraud and money-laundering charges in South Dakota. The case against Erickson is still pending.\n\nIn addition, the chief executive officer of Overstock.com, Patrick Byrne resigned in August after confirming a report by the Fox News contributor Sara Carter that he also had an intimate relationship with Butina.\n\nFederal prosecutors have said Butina did not engage in \u201ctraditional\u201d spy craft, but worked behind the scenes to make inroads in conservative political circles and promote friendlier US-Russian relations. She arranged dinners in Washington and New York and attended events to meet prominent politicians.\n\nNRA acted as 'foreign asset' to Russia before 2016 election, says Senate report Read more\n\nButina in 2015 appeared at a Trump campaign event and asked him a question about whether he wanted better relations with Russia. Trump responded by telling Butina that he would \u201cget along very nicely with Putin\u201d.\n\nRussia\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs last year accused the United States of forcing Butina to make a false confession to \u201cabsolutely ridiculous charges\u201d of being a Russian agent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear what she was convicted of or what crime she committed,\u201d Putin said in April. \u201cI think it\u2019s a prime example of \u2018saving face\u2019. They arrested her and put the girl in jail. But there was nothing on her, so in order not to look totally stupid they gave her, fixed her up, with an 18-month sentence to show that she was guilty of something.\u201d", "description": "Butina, 31, who conspired with conservatives to infiltrate gun lobby, freed early from 18-month sentence for good behavior", "authors": ["Reuters In Washington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2b3d08a8f449090876001ba35a11d3e87720dd1/0_76_2266_1359/master/2266.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=305394be2c84814db428aa81c4f97bb9", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
