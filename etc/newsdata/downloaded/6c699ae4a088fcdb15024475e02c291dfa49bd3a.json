Well, he\u2019s still dead. He was indicted on various sex crimes charges, with heinous allegations of abuse and assault involving underage girls. He\u2019s the textbook example of what a lot of money, power, and influence can afford you. Hat tip to The Miami Herald who reported on Epstein\u2019s sweetheart deal in the mid-2000s that led to him escaping full accountability. It was cupcake time and it led to the resignation of former Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, who served as a U.S. attorney at the time. There have been reports that Epstein's private island was wired for sound, possibly to provide him with blackmail tapes. His Manhattan residence was searched and troves of incriminating (and bizarre) evidence were also discovered.\n\nWhile awaiting trial, Epstein killed himself in his cell. The cause of death is officially self-strangulation, but the circumstances that led to his death raised the eyes of many, even in the liberal media. He was taken off suicide watch only after he had attempted to take his own life two weeks prior, there were allegations that the prison logs were falsified, that there were guards falling asleep on duty, and that the one on watch the night Epstein died was a substitute. Oh, and shrieks were reportedly heard from his cell the night of his death. You know about the Clinton Body Count conspiracy theory; the folks who are into this are having a field day. It\u2019s all too coincidental, right? Well, a pathologist hired by Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s brother now says that the injuries the convicted sexual predator sustained during his reported suicide attempt are more aligned with homicide victims than those who have taken their own lives. He said in 50 years he\u2019s never seen injuries like the ones exhibited on Epstein\u2019s body on those who have committed suicide in this way (via NYT):\n\nA forensic pathologist hired by Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s brother claimed on Wednesday that evidence suggested that Mr. Epstein did not die by suicide, but may have been strangled. The authorities, including the New York City medical examiner, have concluded that the death of Mr. Epstein, the financier who was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, was caused by hanging in his jail cell. But the pathologist, Dr. Michael Baden, said on the morning TV show \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that Mr. Epstein, 66, experienced a number of injuries that \u201care extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation.\u201d \u201cI think that the evidence points to homicide rather than suicide,\u201d Dr. Baden said, who observed the autopsy, which was conducted by city officials. Dr. Baden, a former New York City medical examiner and a Fox News contributor, added, \u201cI\u2019ve not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case.\u201d\n\nSo, we have two differing opinions from two medical professionals about the death of Epstein. And now the rumors and theories will fly again, as they should perhaps in this case. Just for once, those who wear tinfoil hats shouldn\u2019t be so quickly dismissed because something is very, very off with this whole fiasco. The guards watching Epstein were reportedly suspended and the warden was reassigned. Attorney General William Barr was appalled that Epstein was allowed to die under federal custody. He\u2019s opened up a full investigation into this matter with the Department of Justice\u2019s inspector general\u2019s office.\n\nUPDATE: Could the case be reopened?\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/30/2019 19:18:51PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Beth Baumann", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/196/84f53d9c-642a-4ad6-a6de-768737bfa57a.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
