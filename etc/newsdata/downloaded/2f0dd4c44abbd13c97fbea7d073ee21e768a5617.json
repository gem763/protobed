(Reuters) - At a retirement community in central Florida, elderly residents waited for a bus on Monday to take them to a shelter as one of the most monstrous Atlantic hurricanes on record crawled toward the state.\n\nMatt Apuzzie, Javina Apuzzie, Steven Apuzzie, and Brian Apuzzie (L-R) get their last few supplies they gathered in their minivan at Pedro Menendez High School where they will be covering for shelter for Hurricane Dorian in St. Augustine, Florida, U.S. September 2, 2019. REUTERS/Maria Alejandra Cardona\n\nMary McNiff, 92, sat in her wheelchair waiting to board at the Good Samaritan Society in Kissimmee, near Orlando, one of more than a million people under evacuation orders along the U.S. East Coast on the Labor Day holiday.\n\n\u201cKind of anxious to get it over with,\u201d she said before a rare trip off the property. \u201cI haven\u2019t been out for two years really with this leg,\u201d she said, pointing to a cast on her left leg that she has been wearing since she had complications with a blood clot.\n\nHurricane Dorian was still miles out to sea, squatting over the Bahamas where it had already destroyed homes with maximum sustained winds of 155 miles per hour (249 kph). Forecasters warned it could still be dangerous as it drew closer to Florida even if its eye did not make landfall in the state.\n\nThe National Weather Service warned of hurricane-strength winds, several feet of storm surges and the risk of dangerous flash floods along much of the Florida coastline in the coming days.\n\nSue Watson, one of McNiff\u2019s neighbours, was reluctant to move from the place she has called home for 14 years.\n\n\u201cI was all set to stay home until they had to turn the water off,\u201d she said as she waited for the bus to pull out. She was not afraid, she said. \u201cGod knows what he\u2019s doing and he\u2019s in control.\u201d\n\nAnother Florida resident, Randy Hightower, 71, evacuated from his mobile home in Daytona Beach to the Volusia County Fair Grounds shelter on Monday with his wife and dog. He called himself \u201can old Florida cracker\u201d and said: \u201cI\u2019m more scared of this one than I\u2019ve ever been of one in Florida before.\u201d\n\nMANDATORY EVACUATIONS\n\nNine counties in Florida have ordered mandatory evacuations, while seven counties have voluntarily evacuations. Farther north, officials in coastal South Carolina and Georgia ordered hundreds of thousands of people to leave their homes for shelter.\n\nOn what would have usually been a bustling Labor Day holiday, historic downtown St. Augustine was instead filled with the sound of power saws, drills and hammers as bay-front businesses fortified themselves against impending winds and flooding.\n\nIt is the third storm Joy Warren and her husband, Andrew, have weathered since buying their 16-bedroom waterfront bed and breakfast more than a decade ago.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many hurricanes it\u2019s been through,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s still here. I love it. I\u2019m going to get in as soon as I can. If it\u2019s trashed, I\u2019ll rebuild again.\u201d\n\nThe Pedro Menendez High School in St. Augustine has been converted into a shelter with space for 500 people. Lee Franco headed inside clutching a pillow and a box of tissues. She had only moved to Florida six months ago but felt prepared.\n\n\u201cBecause I was following the news, I knew what I needed, so we have sleeping bags, our papers and everything we need,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so boring there, there\u2019s nothing to do. You read and play with the telephone and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nSteven Apuzzi, 49, was hoping he and his three children would get in. His family has been homeless and arrived at the shelter in a gray Dodge caravan in which they have been sleeping.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going through it,\u201d he said, describing the problems a single father faces getting access to shelter. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be able to get into this shelter. I\u2019m hoping and praying.\u201d\n\nThe shelter eventually let him in and he called it a blessing. Once the hurricane passed, he was not sure where the family would head next.", "description": "At a retirement community in central Florida, elderly residents waited for a bus on Monday to take them to a shelter as one of the most monstrous Atlantic hurricanes on record crawled toward the state.", "authors": ["Gabriella Borter", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425516906&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF811II"}
