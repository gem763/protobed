REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nSince Johnson won the top job in July, Britain\u2019s Brexit crisis has spun more furiously, leaving investors and allies bewildered by an array of decisions that diplomats compare to the disorientating style of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nJohnson said on Tuesday he would not request an extension to Brexit, hours after a law came into force demanding that he delay until 2020 unless he can strike a divorce deal. Before its suspension, parliament refused his demand for a snap election.\n\nCummings, the puppet master of Brexit who is cast by enemies variously as an anarchist, Britain\u2019s Rasputin or a political vandal, was serene on Tuesday at the centre of the Brexit maelstrom.\n\nWhen asked what his next move would be on Brexit, Cummings told Reuters: \u201cYou guys should get outside London and go to talk to people who are not rich \u2018remainers\u2019.\u201d\n\nAsked if the United Kingdom would leave on Oct. 31, the 47-year-old Oxford graduate said: \u201cSure.\u201d\n\nIf there is a grand strategy, Johnson\u2019s next move will shape the future of the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy for generations; at stake is the fate of the Brexit endeavour, which both sides cast as the United Kingdom\u2019s most significant decision since World War Two.\n\nBut the chessboard has several dimensions: Johnson must factor the absence of any majority in parliament and the electoral threat from the Brexit Party of Nigel Farage, which increases if Brexit is delayed beyond Oct. 31.\n\nUltimately, Johnson has five choices: strike and ratify a deal with the EU in 50 days; renege on his promises to leave the EU on Oct. 31; somehow get around the law; resign to let another leader request a delay; or an election is triggered.\n\nDEAL OR RESIGN?\n\nAs sterling markets see-saw on the different Brexit outcomes, Johnson says he can get a deal on the last day of the Oct. 17-18 EU summit.\n\n\u201cThere is a way of getting a deal but it will take a lot of hard work. We must be prepared to come out without one,\u201d he said on Tuesday.\n\nGiven there is so little time left, any deal would in effect be a modified version of the Withdrawal Agreement that his predecessor Theresa May struck in November.\n\n\u201cBoris will try to ram through a modified Withdrawal Agreement,\u201d said one Brexit-supporting source. \u201cHe\u2019ll pivot to trying to get a deal.\u201d\n\nCummings, though cast as a Brexit extremist by enemies, was a supporter of a smooth exit from the EU as was his political patron, Michael Gove.\n\nGoldman Sachs said its base case was a deal, giving it 55% probability, but cut its no-deal probability from 25% to 20% and lowered its probability of no Brexit from 30% to 25%.\n\n\u201cWe think the prime minister will re-engage in Brexit negotiations with the EU, aiming to confront MPs in late October with a binary choice between a Brexit deal and a pre-Brexit general election,\u201d Goldman Sachs said.\n\nBut the lack of any majority in parliament has reduced the inclination of the EU to negotiate and even if Johnson did get a deal means he would have trouble ratifying it.\n\n\u201cThere is no majority in the House of Commons for anything that Johnson wants,\u201d said one EU official.\n\n\u201cWe have no other choice but to see if we can get a deal with them. But so far the UK side has not put anything on the table that would make us think this is really what they are aiming at,\u201d the official said.\n\nThere are, though, much more radical options.\n\n\u201cTRUST THE PEOPLE\u201d\n\nCummings, who alongside fellow campaigner Matthew Elliott, drove Vote Leave to victory in the 2016 referendum is cast by allies as a ruthless strategist who cares little for the conventions of traditional British politics.\n\nHe provoked a row inside Westminster when he sacked a 27-year-old adviser to finance minister Sajid Javid. The adviser, Sonia Khan, was escorted by armed police from Downing Street without Javid\u2019s knowledge.\n\nFormer Prime Minister John Major cast Cummings as an overmighty \u201cpolitical anarchist\u201d who should be sacked as Johnson\u2019s de-facto chief of staff before he poisoned British politics beyond repair.\n\nCummings\u2019s response? \u201cTrust the people\u201d - a slogan used by government advisers to cast Johnson\u2019s Brexit-supporting team as the true servants of the people fighting a London political and financial elite that wants to thwart their will.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Monday that the United Kingdom was in dangerous territory as voters were concluding that parliament was hindering Brexit. He said the government would respect the law but that interpretations of the law can sometimes be complex.\n\n\u201cAt this point, our view is that resignation is the most likely,\u201d U.S. investment bank JPMorgan said. \u201cIn our view, neither seeking to defy the law, nor encouraging the EU not to grant an extension, are likely to succeed.\u201d\n\nThe Cabinet Manual, which sets out the laws, rules and conventions on the operation of government, says if the prime minister resigns on behalf of the government then Queen Elizabeth will invite the person who appears most likely to be able to command the confidence of lawmakers to serve as prime minister and form a government.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nA Conservative Party lawmaker said he thought Johnson would resign soon after the EU summit, ensuring that he is not blamed for any delay to Brexit.\n\n\u201cThe question is: what has Cummings got up his sleeve?\u201d said a former Conservative adviser.\n\n\u201cHe is one of the smartest people I have ever worked with. He thinks several steps ahead, thrives on chaos and has sat in a bunker for three years thinking about this: so what is he going to do?\u201d", "description": "Boxed in by parliament, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's next move on the Brexit chessboard will most likely be played with the ruthless bravura that his senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, built his reputation on.", "authors": ["Guy Faulconbridge", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428368091&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF891GF", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
