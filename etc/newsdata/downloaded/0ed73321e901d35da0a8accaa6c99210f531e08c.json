Photo: Screenshots via CNN\n\nJust two weeks after hiring Rudy Giuliani to serve as his personal attorney, the former New York mayor appeared on Sean Hannity\u2019s show and contradicted several of his client\u2019s key claims in a performance so bonkers that Fox News hosts deemed it \u201ca problem.\u201d Though this incident and subsequent gaffe-filled media spots reportedly left Trump \u201cfurious,\u201d no one reeled Giuliani in. And for whatever reason, Giuliani\u2019s appalling public comments \u2014 like when he acknowledged in May that some might find his efforts to make Ukraine investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals \u201cimproper\u201d \u2014 had few immediate consequences.\n\nSo, as reports of a mysterious whistle-blower complaint began to blot out all other news in Washington, the Trump administration stuck with this de facto strategy. Giuliani embarked on an especially unhinged media blitz that has seen him lob insults at journalists, pretend to be a robot, proclaim himself \u201cthe real whistle-blower.\u201d Here are the highlights.\n\nSeptember 19: Giuliani\u2019s CNN meltdown\n\nIn a painful, tense, and altogether unwatchable 28-minute interview with Chris Cuomo, Giuliani promoted allegations of corruption against Joe Biden, whom Trump and his allies say pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor to benefit Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. Naturally, the version of this story that Giuliani and Trump are telling is full of holes and outright lies.\n\nAs Cuomo pointed out these problems to Giuliani, the former New York City mayor contorted his face and called the CNN host names. He also denied asking Ukraine to investigate Biden 30 seconds before he admitted asking Ukraine to investigate Biden.\n\nSeptember 22: Giuliani retreats to friendly territory, faces unfriendly questions\n\nA few days later, Giuliani appeared on Fox News, perhaps hoping for better treatment on Trump\u2019s favorite news network. He didn\u2019t get it. In an interview on Fox News Sunday, John Roberts asked Giuliani about contradicting himself on CNN and the broader impropriety of his mission in Ukraine. \u201cHow is your coverage so distorted?\u201d the former mayor shot back, later accusing Robert of being \u201creally unfair.\u201d\n\nSeptember 24: Giuliani tells fellow panelist to \u201cshut up, moron\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Giuliani to forgive Fox. On Tuesday, he joined Laura Ingraham, one of the network\u2019s more reliable Trump defenders, who gave him a platform to clean up the mess he\u2019d made the previous few days. In a rambling interview, Giuliani invoked Tammany Hall, referred to himself as a humble \u201ccountry lawyer,\u201d and claimed that the State Department asked him to conduct the investigation in Ukraine (the White House\u2019s own summary of Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukraine\u2019s president disputes that).\n\nThe most unhinged moment of Giuliani\u2019s appearance came when he blew up at liberal radio host Christopher Hahn, calling him a \u201cmoron\u201d and an \u201cidiot.\u201d\n\nLOL! Rudy Giuliani made a guest appearance later during Ingraham's show and immediately started calling a co-panelist \"an idiot\" and yelling at him to \"shut up.\" pic.twitter.com/Mh2LbJXuaT \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 25, 2019\n\nSeptember 25: Giuliani explains this is all Obama\u2019s fault\n\nAfter ripping into Hahn on Ingraham\u2019s show, Giuliani was up late tweeting about John Kerry\u2019s stepson, the nephew of Whitey Bulger, and Barack Obama. To anyone not steeped in the language of right-wing conspiracy mongering, it\u2019s head-spinning stuff. But as Media Matters explains, Giuliani\u2019s claims are part of the Trump campaign\u2019s plan to promote the claims made in a 2018 book by Breitbart News senior editor Peter Schweizer. And on the morning of September 25, he went on Fox & Friends to repeat them.\n\nThe hosts looked miserable.\n\n\"What did Obama know and when did he know it?\" Giuliani is fixated on Obama-era scandal-mongering. Fox & Friends hosts keep trying to steer the conversation back to Trump but Rudy won't let them. It's a bizarre spectacle. pic.twitter.com/VE6A0swTAO \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 25, 2019\n\nSeptember 26: With a font this big, it has to be true\n\nBack on Ingraham\u2019s show on September 26, Giuliani tried to prove his claim that the State Department asked him to look into Biden\u2019s history in Ukraine and push back against the suggestions that he\u2019d gone rogue. A few hours after tweeting screenshots of his personal text messages with Kurt Volker, the U.S. special representative for Ukraine until his resignation last Friday, Giuliani read the texts on TV \u2014 which for some reason required glasses and 900-point font.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s Kurt saying, \u2018Great, I will tell Yermak and he\u2019ll visit you there, thanks,\u2019 [and] \u2018Mr. Mayor, how was your meeting with Andriy? Do you have time for a call? Best, Kurt,\u2019\u201d Giuliani read. Andriy Yermak is an aide to Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. \u201cThey\u2019re all over me, asking me to do it. I was happy to do it. I helped my country get this relationship in good shape,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nHere's Rudy Giuliani reading personal text messages live on air in an effort to prove just how deeply involved in this Ukraine mess the State Department is pic.twitter.com/4uUWiE5mjA \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 27, 2019\n\nLater on the show, he did an impression of Mitt Romney.\n\nSeptember 27: Giuliani angrily informs reporters that he\u2019s \u201cthe real hero\u201d\n\nAfter an epic week on TV news, Giuliani remembered to let print media in on the fun. In quotes published on Friday, Giuliani told Politico that he is the real whistle-blower and suggested that he might be assassinated as the details of the Ukraine story come out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the real whistleblower,\u201d declared Giuliani, who claimed to possess more damaging information and insisted that he, too, should be entitled to whistleblower protections. \u201cIf I get killed now,\u201d he warned, \u201cYou won\u2019t get the rest of the story.\u201d\n\nSeparately, in an \u201cangry\u201d phone call with The Atlantic\u2019s Elaina Plott, Giuliani revealed that the whistle-blower is not the hero of this story \u2014 he is.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible that the whistle-blower is a hero and I\u2019m not. And I will be the hero! These morons\u2014when this is over, I will be the hero,\u201d Giuliani told me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not acting as a lawyer. I\u2019m acting as someone who has devoted most of his life to straightening out government,\u201d he continued, sounding out of breath. \u201cAnything I did should be praised.\u201d\n\nSeptember 29: If it\u2019s Sunday, it\u2019s mock the press\n\nYou may have taken the weekend off, but Giuliani didn\u2019t. He appeared on two Sunday morning talk shows, including This Week With George Stephanopoulos, where Giuliani spent nearly 15 minutes sparring with the host and pushing the Trump administration\u2019s line on Ukraine. When the interview came to a merciful end, Giuliani mocked Stephanopoulos.\n\nGiuliani was insulting and wouldn't stop talking as Stephanopoulos tried to wrap up an interview in which the president's lawyer relentlessly pushed Biden/George Soros/Ukraine conspiracy theories pic.twitter.com/3x0JpLO5Kn \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 29, 2019\n\nLater Sunday, reports surfaced that the Biden campaign had asked TV news networks to step letting Giuliani on air. On Monday, he was back on Fox Business.\n\nSeptember 30: Biden Isn\u2019t Even Good at Being Crooked\n\nWrapping up the month, Giuliani went on Hannity to make fun of Joe Biden for not having nice stuff. He also forwarded a theory that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama colluded with Ukraine to find compromising material in 2017, which would be a poorly-timed plot for the Democratic leaders.\n\nGiuliani still isn't making much sense pic.twitter.com/Wwwb3Fn5EU \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 1, 2019\n\nGiuliani begins his Hannity interview by pushing a conspiracy theory about Obama and Hillary Clinton colluding with Ukraine to dig up dirt on Trump in January 2017 -- which doesn't make much sense since the presidential election had come and gone by then pic.twitter.com/08yHvUYcgJ \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 1, 2019\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
