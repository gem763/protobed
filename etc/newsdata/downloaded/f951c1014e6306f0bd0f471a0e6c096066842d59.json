And remember, the man behind the decks does not take requests. Follow these simple edicts and you\u2019ll thoroughly enjoy this idiosyncratic bar\n\nThere are few places in Tokyo as polarising as Bar Martha. Online reviews congregate heavily around both ends of the scale and, depending which you listen to, it is either the \u201cworst experience in Tokyo\u201d or \u201cbrilliantly unapologetic\u201d and \u201ccoolest place in the city\u201d.\n\nThis is no accident \u2013 few things are at this bar. Rather it is the product of the take-no-prisoners attitude of the bar\u2019s owner, Wataru Fukuyama, a 56-year-old visionary or tyrant, according to your take on him.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Visionary or tyrant?\u2019 \u2026 Wataru Fukuyama. Photograph: Oscar Boyd\n\nBar Martha is what is known in Japan as a listening bar, where music comes first and talking a definite second. Though there are others in the city \u2013 JBS and Grandfather\u2019s are among the better-known \u2013 Bar Martha, in Tokyo\u2019s Ebisu neighbourhood, is further off the beaten track, patronised by Japanese audiophiles and well-dressed locals.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Oscar Boyd\n\nThose who talk too loudly or disturb the atmosphere are liable to be unceremoniously thrown out. This is not a place to visit in a large group ready for loud and lively conversation; groups larger than two or three should head instead to an izakaya (pub).\n\n\u201cI have never run a bar that has considered what the customer wants,\u201d says Fukuyama tells us one evening at his bar. \u201cPeople often say that the customer is always right, but I\u2019m not confident that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t do something just because it will attract customers. [Bar Martha] is about what I like doing and the kind of place I want to run.\u201d\n\nWhat Fukuyama likes is music. Enter the softly lit, cavernous bar space and, after a brief explanation of the rules, you\u2019ll be greeted by a vast wall of more than 6,000 vinyl records, which Fukuyama plays on twin turntables. Music is played across two 1960s Tannoy speakers, which Fukuyama chose for a vintage quality that sounds \u201cakin to a rainy day in the UK\u201d, where the speakers were originally built.\n\n\u201cI look at the customers and think \u2018who is listening?\u2019\u201d says Fukuyama. \u201cOnly 50 people can be in here at any one time. I often play music for the one person who is listening most intently. I think to myself, \u2018How old are they? What would they want to listen to?\u2019 I play something and watch for their reaction.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The bar has more than 6,000 vinyl records. Photograph: Oscar Boyd\n\nOver the course of an evening, the soundtrack shifts from mellow Ella Fitzgerald to the raucous clang of The Clash\u2019s \u201cShould I Stay or Should I Go\u201d, shifting with the flow of customers in and out of the bar. The music is never static, never dwells on one genre for too long.\n\nNestled between and in front of the speakers are rows of high-end bottles of whisky, glistening beneath spotlights. The spirit is Bar Martha\u2019s main focus, but the menu is all-encompassing, and ranges from draft beer through to a very enjoyable mango mojito.\n\nThe 50 seats are spread between a long wooden counter (sit here to be closest to the bartenders, the vinyls and the watchful eye of Fukuyama) and more intimate hardwood tables in the recesses toward the back.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The modest, but stylish, exterior. Photograph: Oscar Boyd\n\nAll designed by Fukuyama, it is extraordinarily photogenic, but here comes the most frequent sticking point: photos are absolutely forbidden; Fukuyama doesn\u2019t use the internet and has no desire for a presence on social media. If caught, you will be politely but firmly be asked to leave or have your next drinks order refused.\n\nCertainly, Bar Martha is not for everyone, but if you\u2019re prepared to follow the rules, it could just be the best bar in Tokyo.\n\n\u2022 \u00a5800 (\u00a36) per person cover charge (added to bill), 1 Chome-22-23 Ebisu, Shibuya City, martha-records.com/martha/\n\nOscar Boyd is the travel and food editor at The Japan Times.
