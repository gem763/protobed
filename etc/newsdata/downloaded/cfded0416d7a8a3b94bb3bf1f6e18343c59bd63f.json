First, the team signed Ziggy Ansah \u2013 who had four sacks in seven games for the Detroit Lions in 2018 and 12 sacks in 14 games in 2017. The second big move came about a week before the start of the season when the team traded for Jadeveon Clowney from the Houston Texans.\n\nSeattle\u2019s two moves give them one of the best defenses in the league.\n\nOn offense, quarterback Russell Wilson will have to deal with the retirement of Doug Baldwin. Tyler Lockett becomes the team\u2019s No. 1 receiver and on the other side, the team will have a rookie in D.K. Metcalf to throw to.\n\nSeattle might have taken a hit offensively, so it will be interesting to see how Wilson \u2013 who signed a major contract extension in the offseason \u2013 handles a new receiving core.\n\nRead below for more about the Seahawks heading into the 2019 season.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n--\n\n2019 SCHEDULE\n\nWeek Date Time (ET) Channel Opponent 1 Sept. 8 4:05 pm CBS Cincinnati Bengals 2 Sept. 15 1:00 pm FOX @ Pittsburgh Steelers 3 Sept. 22 4:25 pm CBS New Orleans Saints 4 Sept. 29 4:05 pm FOX @ Arizona Cardinals 5 Oct. 3 8:20 pm FOX/NFL Los Angeles Rams 6 Oct. 13 1:00 pm FOX @ Cleveland Browns 7 Oct. 20 4:25 pm FOX Baltimore Ravens 8 Oct. 27 1:00 pm FOX @ Atlanta Falcons 9 Nov. 3 4:05 pm FOX Tampa Bay Buccaneers 10 Nov. 11 8:15 pm ESPN @ San Francisco 49ers 11 Bye 12 Nov. 24 8:20 pm NBC @ Philadelphia Eagles 13 Dec. 2 8:15 pm ESPN Minnesota Vikings 14 Dec. 8 8:20 pm NBC @ Los Angeles Rams 15 Dec. 15 1:00 pm FOX @ Carolina Panthers 16 Dec. 22 4:25 pm FOX Arizona Cardinals 17 Dec. 29 4:25 pm FOX San Francisco 49ers\n\n--\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nQB: Russell Wilson\n\nWR: Tyler Lockett\n\nWR: D.K.
