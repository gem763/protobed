I was sending back more than \u00a31,000 working 18 hours days, seven days a week.\n\n(Image: James Breeden)\n\n(Image: James Breeden)\n\n\u201cMy day in the UK would start at 6am and I wouldn\u2019t finish until midnight.\n\n\u201cIt was extremely hard but what kept me going is that I needed to support my family back home.\u2019\n\nA raid by immigration officials then put an end to his \u201cdream life\u201d and he was deported back to Vietnam.\n\nBut Nguyen says: \u201cI earned in two years in Britain what would take me 20 years in Vietnam.\n\n\u201cThe paddy fields that once provided me with a living now stand in stagnant water as we drown in a mountain of debt.\n\nThe only way out is to risk our lives and try to reach the UK, where the money can support all our families and pay off our debts.\u201d\n\n(Image: James Breeden)\n\nNguyen spoke to me as it was revealed the family of a teenage boy fear he is the youngest victim of the tragedy in Essex.\n\nThe sister of 15-year-old Nguyen Huy Hung has told how communications with her brother ended on October 22, the day before the bodies were found.\n\nShe posted on Facebook: \u201cOn Monday evening, my brother left France for the UK and we haven\u2019t been able to contact him since then.\u201d\n\nThe father of another victim revealed he was told of his death by the traffickers he had paid to get his son to Britain.\n\nThat does not surprise Nguyen, who tells me: \u201cThe planning of these gangs is military-like. They know when and where everyone is at any given time and that is why it is the traffickers, not the police, who told the families last week that their loved-ones did not make it.\u201d\n\n(Image: James Breeden)\n\n(Image: James Breeden)\n\nNguyen was smuggled to Hanoi in 2011 then flown to the Czech Republic on a tourist visa for \u00a34,600. Before landing in Europe, he had to pay another \u00a3800. After a week in Prague, Nguyen was told to pay another \u00a31,000 and go to Germany, where he was smuggled over the border in a minivan.\n\nAn attempt to claim asylum failed and after 18 months he fled Dresden and his family paid a further \u00a39,000 to smuggle him into the UK.\n\nHe says: \u201cPeople seem to assume it is the gangs who seek us out. It\u2019s not the case. Families in my area decide which of them should be sent to the UK before they all raise money to pay traffickers. Those that died last week are saddled with huge debts and the UK for them was the only way out.\u201d\n\nHe was deported in late 2017, and his family are still enjoying the spoils of his time in Britain, living in their new brick house. But Nguyen is still in the grip of gangsters who run this area, where 25 of the Essex victims were from.\n\nAs we speak, he receives a chilling call, threatening violence if he keeps talking about the trafficking network. Yards away from us is the home of grieving relatives of Essex lorry victim Le Van Ha, 30.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe family reveal how Le Van Ha was taken from Ha Tinh to Saigon, then Malaysia, Turkey, Greece and France before going into the trailer.\n\nAnother victim, Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, travelled through Russia in 2017, then Ukraine, Germany and France before boarding the lorry.\n\nEveryone in the hamlet seems to know someone who has made the journey using what they call \u201cthe line\u201d.\n\nWalking the streets, it is clear why families send loved ones on the perilous journey. Throughout the area are two and three-storey houses, built in the last decade with money earned overseas. Some are next to the owners\u2019 original rickety homes.\n\nNguyen Dinh Sat mourns his son Nguyen Dinh Tu in the shadow of the palatial home he had built.\n\nLast year, after local farming collapsed, 26-year-old Dinh Tu went to Romania, working illegally in a factory for \u00a3400 per month.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThat money failed to cover the loan he had taken out to build his house and the debts mounted as his wife Hoang Thi Thuong struggled to feed their one-year-old daughter.\n\nHe hoped a move to the UK would give him the income he needed, and so his family paid \u00a311,000 to smugglers.\n\nHis father tells me the gang had trafficked his son from Vietnam to Romania, Germany and France before sending him to his death in the trailer.\n\nIt was the traffickers who broke the news of his son\u2019s death to 70-year-old Dinh Sat. Sitting next to a shrine dedicated to his son in the house where he had planned to raise his family, Dinh Sat tells me: \u201cHe is gone now. There is nothing left of him. He died.\u201d\n\nOfficials here are collecting DNA from relatives to identify victims, but families want loved one\u2019s bodies back.\n\nDinh Sat says: \u201cHe had a mountain of debt on the house and was frightened the bank would take it and our land, that is why he went to Europe.\n\n\u201cNever did I think he would be put at such grave risk. Not only have I lost my son, but we could lose everything my family has worked so hard for over the generations.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Nguyen Dung, 32, worked at a Birmingham curry restaurant for years after surviving trafficking", "authors": ["Christopher Bucktin", "Image", "Getty Images", "James Breeden", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20743434.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_39-Bodies-Discovered-In-Lorry-In-Thurrock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
