I was constantly worried about putting on weight, and I had insecurities about people watching me eat.\n\n'And it even got to the point, instead of going to the kitchen, I'd often cook and eat my food on a stove in my room.\n\n'But when I started watching Mukbang videos I realised that food wasn't the big bad wolf, or something to be afraid of - so I decided to try making one myself.'\n\nHaving previously tried counselling to ease her anxiety around food without success, Fabio said her videos are like 'home therapy' and she is now happy to make money by wolfing down takeaways online.\n\nThe former office administrator (pictured in one of her most popular clips), who boasts an 8,000 strong following, is one of the first UK YouTubers to join the fad after watching one of the films back in 2014\n\nUpon making her first video in 2018, Fabio (pictured) said she found it strangely therapeutic after worrying about gaining weight and struggling to eat in front of people since her late teens\n\nShe continued: 'I get a lot of people who suffer from anxiety messaging me. They say my videos have helped take their mind off things, which, in turn helps me by boosting my self-esteem.\n\n'Also, if someone's a bit lonely they message me and say, \"Thanks for keeping me company.\" I want my videos to be a warm and inviting space - it's like an online community of friends.'\n\nFabio has a growing fan base for her Mukbang output, with almost 90 per cent of her viewers living in the USA and has now made more than 50 clips - capturing herself eating an array of foods, ranging from chocolate fudge cake to chicken nuggets and chips.\n\n'Fast food is the most popular, though. I think people like watching it as a guilty pleasure,' she explained.\n\n'The food you eat on camera needs to be exciting, so I always try and research what is doing well. Eating salads is never going to be as popular as eating a takeaway, as its way too virtuous.\n\nHaving previously tried counselling to ease her anxiety around food without success, Fabio (pictured) said her videos are like 'home therapy' and she is now happy to make money by wolfing down takeaways online\n\n'If someone's trying to cut out carbs, or is allergic to a certain type of food, I think they get a kick out of watching someone else eat what they can't.'\n\nWhile she believes many of her subscribers watch her videos for some innocent fun, Fabio \u2013 who also uploads make-up tutorials to YouTube - admits there are some who get their kicks from watching her scoff.\n\n'I can understand why people with food fetishes would watch my videos,' she said, admitting that her family were initially sceptical about her films and struggled to 'get their heads around' the idea of her eating food online.\n\n'I can see how some viewers might find some aspects of my videos arousing - like my lips being around a burger or hot dog.'\n\nBut as well as a platoon of fans, Fabio has also attracted her fair share of online trolls.\n\nFabio (pictured) has a growing fan base for her Mukbang output, with almost 90 per cent of her viewers living in the USA and has now made more than 50 clips\n\n'You have to take the bad with the good, but some people can just be plain rude,' she said. 'People will say stuff like, \"Who is that creature?\" or \"Look at those lips?\" It can be disheartening, but I know it's just Internet trolls with nothing better to do.'\n\nFabio has even learnt how to control her video budgets, by first making Cookbang videos - another Korean-inspired trend for cooking clips - and then eating what she makes on a Mukbang film.\n\nBut as well as a platoon of fans, Fabio, pictured, has also attracted her fair share of online trolls\n\n'It can be expensive to film with junk food all the time, so I started doing Cookbangs,' Fabio explained.\n\n'I had requests from my subscribers who wanted me cook too. I think it gives them a different perspective on the food I eat. I take the audience through the cooking process of dishes like chilli or sausages and mash, and then they can watch me eat it at the end.'\n\nUnlike some of her Mukbang contemporaries, who gorge on vast amounts of food, Fabio \u2013 who films her content in the corner of her living room - says her portions are more controlled.\n\n'I'm more relatable than other Mukbang stars,' she said. 'I don't just sit there and eat as much as I can - I eat plenty, but I limit it. If I'm eating a takeaway like KFC, I'll always order a selection - but no more than four pieces.'\n\nObserving how making Mukbang videos has improved Fabio's self-confidence, her family, although initially sceptical, now see them as a good thing. 'Now my mum watches my videos and she even suggests what I can eat on them,'\n\nUnlike some of her Mukbang contemporaries, who gorge on vast amounts of food, Fabio \u2013 who films her content in the corner of her living room - says her portions are more controlled\n\nFabio said. 'She can see that making them has helped my head space. It's not just eating it's about sharing a story too. You can chat to the camera about anything while you eat, and for me that's like having therapy at home.\n\n'And, rather than my videos being just about food, I talk to the audience about everything from my life to just how my day has been. I'm quite real, and if I'm feeling sad, I'll tell my viewers.'\n\nFor the future, Fabio hopes to continue to develop her YouTube channel and has ambitions to increase her following in the UK.\n\nShe concluded: 'I'd love to have millions of followers from all over the world. But I'd really like to grow a fan base closer to home. I hope by continuing to make videos I can help other people too.'", "description": "Fabio Mattison, 28, who lives in North Yorkshire is one of the first UK YouTubers to adopt the South Korean Mukbang craze and films herself eating food as she interacts with followers.", "authors": ["Jessica Green For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/08/19980900-0-image-a-4_1571644577857.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
