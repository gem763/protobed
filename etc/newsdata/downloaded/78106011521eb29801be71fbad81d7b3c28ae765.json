I promise I will send it back to you,\" she explained.\n\nIt's frustrating for Jessica because people will contact her when its got nothing to do with her.\n\nShe said: \"They even give them my Instagram to say that this is my page and this is who I am so they are literally stealing my identity.\n\n\"This man on Facebook messaged me and he was aggressive, I said sorry, it hasn't been me messaging you.\n\n\"A lot of people do fall for it and its really worrying to think about actually. They take it personally and get quite emotionally involved.\n\n\"They tend to use my old modelling pictures, they even used an old picture of me and my granddad who has now passed away. That was a picture that my brother uploaded so they had searched for personal photos.\n\n\"Its stressful and I feel awful, it's just an invasion of privacy really.\n\n\n\n\"I hate to draw attention to it but I feel like I have to say its not me as people generally feel that people are talking to them.\n\n(Image: Jess Davies/Instagram)\n\n\"It always seems to be lonely or older men they target. Young people are more aware of catfishing. The older generation seem to take everything face value.\"\n\nShe admits that she doesn't know what can be done to stop it from happening.\n\n\"It happens on such a large scale. All you need is an email address and you can be whoever you want to be.\n\n\"Its out of control, you don't know who you are speaking to.\n\n\n\n\"My family and friends think its bizarre, its not something that you think would happen.\"", "description": "Jessica Davies, who used to model for glamour magazines has opened up about her struggles preventing criminals and pranksters stealing her photos to 'catfish' others online", "authors": ["Katie Bellis", "Image", "Jess Davies Instagram", "Media Wales"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20572221.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jessica-Davies1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
