They just don\u2019t understand. All right. Go home to mom.\"\n\nMore laughter.\n\n\u201cExplain to mom that you tried to take on very powerful people, and many of them physically as well as mentally,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a good thing to do \u2014 not in this room. Be careful. Make sure you don\u2019t hurt them, please. Thank you.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe powerful people in the room were attending the annual Shale Insight conference, an annual energy-industry event focused on fracking in the Marcellus shale basin, a region that overlaps in part with the key voting states of Ohio and Pennsylvania. Many of those in attendance comported with Trump\u2019s central-casting view of toughness \u2014 a number of big guys in hard hats sat near him on the stage.\n\nAD\n\nHis response to the protesters was itself quintessential Trump. During the 2016 campaign, he was occasionally more explicit, at one point telling supporters at a rally that if they assaulted a protester who was about to throw a tomato, he would pay the supporter\u2019s legal bills. At another rally, Trump said of a protester that he\u2019d like to \u201cpunch him in the face.\u201d\n\nAfter several incidents in which protesters at Trump rallies were assaulted, Trump modified his language. He embraces physical toughness as a virtue and has demonstrated few qualms about those who speak out against him being handled roughly. But he has mastered the ability to say what he means in a way that he can claim to have meant the opposite. So when the protest began in Pittsburgh, he said what he was supposed to say \u2014 but with a wink.\n\nAD\n\nNot that he was being particularly subtle. A few hours later, he tweeted out a clip of his comments with a stage wink so exaggerated that no would could mistake what he was saying.\n\nAD\n\nTrump embraces this idea that he\u2019s the representative of the toughest Americans, people who would do battle for him if necessary. In an interview with Breitbart in March, Trump made that point explicitly.\n\n\u201cI can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump \u2014 I have the tough people, but they don\u2019t play it tough,\u201d he said \u2014 \u201cuntil they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad.\u201d\n\nTrump has said similar things before, and the message isn\u2019t lost on his supporters. Lawyers for a veteran who pushed a protester at a rally during 2016 said that he did so \u201cin response to \u2014 and inspired by \u2014 Trump and/or Trump campaign\u2019s urging to remove the protesters.\u201d Others have pointed to Trump\u2019s rhetoric as an inspiration for attempted or actual acts of violence. Cesar Sayoc, the man who mailed inert pipe bombs to Democratic politicians and members of the media last year, was a Trump supporter, and Trump\u2019s rhetoric was similarly identified as one causal factor in his actions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs it turns out, Trump\u2019s rhetoric was the focal point of the protesters in Pittsburgh.\n\nWATCH: 8 Jews just disrupted @realDonaldTrump\u2019s speech in Pittsburgh \u2014 one year after the Tree of Life shooting.\n\n\n\nTrump continues to endanger Jews and all of us. #OurSolidarityWill defeat white nationalism.\n\n\n\nJoin us & @IfNotNowOrg in pledging solidarity: https://t.co/SXzEFCFrlM pic.twitter.com/i6FjZOeg6b \u2014 Bend the Arc: Jewish Action (@jewishaction) October 23, 2019\n\nIn late October last year, a gunman entered the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh\u2019s Squirrel Hill neighborhood, murdering 11 Jewish worshipers ranging in age from 54 to 97. Shortly before the attack, the alleged shooter identified a Jewish immigration group as a focus of his hatred, merging anti-Semitism with an anti-immigrant sentiment that had escalated as the 2018 midterm elections approached.\n\nImmigrants, in the alleged shooter\u2019s description, were \u201cinvaders\u201d \u2014 language that Trump himself used both before and after the shooting. Trump\u2019s use of the term became a focus after a mass shooting in El Paso earlier this year, when that alleged shooter claimed to be responding to an invasion of immigrants.\n\nAD\n\nThe Pittsburgh protesters, affiliated with an organization called Bend the Arc, posted a statement about their intent.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe gunman who entered the synagogue a year ago was driven by fear and lies to kill Jewish people and stop new immigrants \u2014 but he didn\u2019t invent these lies. He heard them from the mouth of this President and the white nationalists this President and his allies have emboldened and enabled,\u201d it read in part. \u201cAnd what did this President do? Instead of changing his ways, he doubled down on his ugly rhetoric and policies of fear, leading to more violence and deaths, from Poway to El Paso to our nation\u2019s immigrant detention facilities, and beyond.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur lives are in danger,\u201d it concluded, \u201cbut our solidarity will set us free.\u201d\n\nHappily, the protesters were not met with physical violence during Trump\u2019s speech, just angry yelling and some middle fingers \u2014 and, of course, a president who wanted to remind them and anyone else listening of how strongly he objected to his powerful, imposing supporters using physical aggression to silence the opposition.\n\nAD", "description": "At an event in Pittsburgh, Trump noted his supporters' physical power to a group of Jewish protestors.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dYARjL7VgpkbYK4moBUL2FqCm7A=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SOOFFKXV3AI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
