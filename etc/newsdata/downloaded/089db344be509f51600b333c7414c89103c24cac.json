FOREX-Hopes for Brexit delay rally pound, dollar slips on US factory data\n\n* Sterling recovers but under pressure amid Brexit chaos\n\n* Aussie dollar jumps as GDP data meets expectations\n\n* Plummeting pound: https://tmsnrt.rs/2N6T2JO\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\n\n\nBy Tom Westbrook\n\nSINGAPORE, Sept 4 (Reuters) - The British pound bounced on\n\nWednesday in the wake of a parliamentary vote opening the door\n\nfor another Brexit delay, while the dollar drifted lower after\n\nweak manufacturing data stoked wagers on aggressive U.S. policy\n\neasing.\n\nThe greenback's doldrums helped the Australian dollar\n\nAUD=D3 shine when June-quarter economic growth, while soft,\n\nwas in line with forecasts, and the currency rose 0.3% to reach\n\na one-week peak of $0.6775.\n\nSterling, pushed to a near three-year low on Wednesday,\n\nclimbed almost 0.2% against the dollar to $1.2100 and firmed\n\n0.1% against the euro.\n\n\"I think there's a real opportunity for the pound,\" said\n\nNick Twidale, director at Sydney FX brokerage Xchainge.\n\nHe said the rise was driven by British lawmakers voting to\n\ndefy Prime Minister Boris Johnson to put a proposal delaying\n\nBritain's exit from the European Union beyond October on\n\nparliament's agenda on Wednesday. \"It now opens up the possibility again of, I suppose the\n\nextreme would be a no-Brexit, but a softer Brexit,\" Twidale\n\nsaid. \"We'd priced in so much of a hard Brexit with Boris\n\nJohnson coming in, that I think there's real opportunity for\n\nsome sterling appreciation.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, sterling dropped under $1.20 and hit its lowest\n\nsince a flash crash in October 2016 and the outlook is still\n\npretty cloudy. Johnson has said he will now push for a snap\n\nelection, which would add yet another major source of\n\nuncertainty.\n\nThe dollar gave up a two-year high touched on Wednesday\n\nagainst a basket of currencies to trade at 98.915, giving\n\nground to the yuan CNY=D3 and steadying against the euro, with\n\none euro buying $1.0975.\n\nThe yen JPY=EBS weakened slightly to 106.11 per dollar\n\nafter a Bank of Japan board member said the central bank must\n\npre-emptively ease monetary policy to fend off risks to the\n\neconomy. The dollar's pullback was prompted by manufacturing activity\n\nin the world's biggest economy contracting for the first time in\n\nthree years last month, according to data from the Institute for\n\nSupply Management. That knocked the wind out of a previously rising greenback\n\nand rallied the bond market as investors increased bets on a\n\ncouple of Federal Reserve rate cuts before Christmas.\n\nA 25-basis-point cut is now fully priced in, while yields on\n\nbenchmark 10-year Treasuries , which fall when prices\n\nrise, dropped to their lowest in two years.\n\n\"The expectation that the Fed will come to the rescue has\n\nincreased,\" said Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at\n\nNational Australia Bank in Sydney.\n\n\"But it's not a capitulation on the dollar. It's just merely\n\nstopped the recent rise of the dollar.\"\n\nThe dollar's weakness help pull the yuan CNY=D3 from an\n\n11-year low to reach 7.1669 per dollar. Its rise was tempered as\n\ntraders kept a wary eye on trade risks, with U.S. President\n\nDonald Trump promising a tougher line on Beijing if trade talks\n\ndrag on.", "description": "FOREX-Hopes for Brexit delay rally pound, dollar slips on US factory data", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC44011_L.jpg"}
