Actual Whistleblowers go on to have their whole lives upended.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, @realDonaldTrump,\u201d Kiriakou responded to the president\u2019s tweet. \u201cPlease pardon me!\u201d\n\nThe White House did not immediately return a message requesting comment.\n\nKiriakou, 55, first made waves after he gave an interview to ABC News in 2007 in which he disclosed the CIA\u2019s use of waterboarding on foreign detainees. He was charged several years later in connection with leaking information about two CIA agents to the media and ultimately entered a plea agreement that resulted in him spending near two years behind bars.\n\nDemocrats in the House of Representatives initiated impeachment proceedings against the president last month amid revelations about a whistleblower complaint filed by a member of the U.S. intelligence community. Mr. Trump and his defenders have since sought to discredit the whistleblower on a regular basis.\n\nKiriakou, as quoted by Mr. Trump, also said on \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d that the person responsible for the complaint is not a whistleblower, but an \u201canonymous source for the Democratic Staff in the House.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet repeating his comment was retweeted more than 19,000 times in 18 hours\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
