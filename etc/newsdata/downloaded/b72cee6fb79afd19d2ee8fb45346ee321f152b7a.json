He tells City Press that the community built the school from scratch.\n\nIt started with two classrooms and has grown to nine.\n\n\u201cGovernment provided us with prefabs in 2012, promising to build permanent structures immediately because the numbers of pupils at the time kept on increasing. But now, seven years later, we are still where we were back then, having no permanent classrooms.\n\n\u201cThe toilets are in a terrible state and with all the stories of children drowning, we always warn pupils to be vigilant. We have submitted a requisition for toilets \u2013 a basic necessity in any school environment \u2013 along with other requirements such as more classrooms, but we are still waiting. We do not know where we stand because there is no communication forthcoming.\u201d\n\nThe school has 367 pupils and 20 teachers, including two who are employed by the school governing body (SGB). Classes cater for Grades 8 to 12.\n\nDespite the challenges, Cele says, the school still managed a 64.5% matric pass rate last year.\n\nCele believes that if the basics were provided \u2013 namely, proper classrooms, a library, a computer room and a well-equipped science laboratory \u2013 the school could achieve even better results.\n\nAnother challenge, he says, lies in the lack of basic necessities in the community itself. Given the scarcity of water and electricity in the village, none of the school\u2019s teachers lives nearby. Instead, they commute from Mbizana, which is 35km away.\n\n\u201cThat has its own challenges because the gravel road between Mbizana and the school is in a poor state, with huge potholes and rocks. So, by the time the teachers get to school, riding at the back of bakkies, they are already tired,\u201d said Cele.\n\n\u201cWhichever way you look at our situation, the conditions are just not favourable. We would like government to fix the roads and supply us with electricity and water.\u201d\n\nThobeka Bhaca, the SGB\u2019s treasurer, adds that it is disappointing that, to date, the government has not provided any assistance.\n\nREAD: How Mam\u2019 Winnie changed my life\n\n\u201cThe government should have at least met us halfway. Look at these dilapidated pit latrines. It is such an embarrassment. What kind of government cannot even provide basic needs such as toilets for young, innocent children?\u201d says Bhaca.\n\n\u201cWe have shown initiative as parents. We built the school from nothing, using our hard-earned money, as poor as we are. Even those toilets were built by us.\n\n\u201cWhat has government done? Why did we vote if this is how this government is going to treat us? It is even more embarrassing because this school is named after one of the great struggle icons of this country, umama Winnie.\u201d\n\nProvincial education spokesperson Mali Mtima said the department was aware of the situation at the school and promised to provide further details later.", "description": "A school named after late struggle icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela does not have a single permanent structure built by the ANC-led government 23 years after the institution was established.", "authors": ["Lubabalo Ngcukana"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9363/0129a448d32743e7b78df9c870fbc800.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
