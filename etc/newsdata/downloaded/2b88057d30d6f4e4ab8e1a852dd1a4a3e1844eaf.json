Thank you for welcoming me into you inbox yet again.\n\nLast week was a short one, but I talked about the merger of a couple of the worst adtech companies in the world.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this on the TechCrunch site, you can get this in your inbox here, and follow my tweets here.\n\nI would also like to take the time to say screw you to Apple for shipping such an awful keyboard that made typing this newsletter so damn difficult\u2026. God! Now, onto the news.\n\nThe big story\n\nOne thing I rarely cover these days is the smart home, this, despite my apartment hosting two HomePods, two Echos, three Google Home devices and a Facebook Portal+.\n\nI\u2019m dying for this stuff to be useful and fun, and, instead, after a few years of playing with the stuff, I just have a handful of commands that I shout out every so often. All of my digital friends can turn on my lights, turn on my TV, play music, tell me the time and weather and a few other things that probably weren\u2019t worth the thousands of dollars it took to bring them and their accompanying IoT gadgets into my home.\n\nIn short, I\u2019m an idiot. On Tuesday, Google will again show off its Pixel 4 smartphone but also its latest visions for the Google Home/Nest line.\n\nI\u2019ve witnessed a few improvements since the first Google Home was announced nearly 3 years ago. After several hardware iterations from Google, Amazon and Facebook, these devices have gotten better looks, better sound and better voices \u2014 occasionally courtesy of celebrity partnerships. These devices are growing more capable in distinguishing user voices and offering feedback based on their individual data.\n\nAt the same time, home virtual assistants still feel awfully alien and firmly stuck in the 1.0 era.\n\nThe Google Home still feels like a flip phone with its basic set of stock apps. Third-party integrations are sparse and largely useless. Plenty of things are \u201cpossible\u201d through smart home integrations, but every added set of rails turns the device into a Swiss army knife, rather than a \u201cnew computing platform.\u201d Google has seemingly had to reorganize some of its devices around IoT with its Nest renaming just to give them a more cohesive mission.\n\nThis is partially an AI problem, but it seems like that element is overplayed when considering long-term potential. Saying a device should \u201cjust know\u201d what to say is hardly a suggestion and there isn\u2019t enough context in the world for a virtual assistant to annoy me less with unheeded guidance or advice. There\u2019s just such a narrow runway for success in using these devices as predictive engines, something that severely impedes their potential as commerce or ad platforms. Even adding a screen has failed to help this along.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a shot at Google any more than it is against Amazon, Facebook and Apple. The only reason I give Google shit here is because I generally like their products the most. The Home boasts by far the most intelligent assistant in my experience; I am still shocked by some of the answers it can pull out of its hat that are leaps and bounds past my HomePod\u2019s Siri capabilities.\n\nBut that still isn\u2019t enough.\n\nI want to be bullish on these devices and voice interfaces as a platform, but they are so painfully unimpressive after several years even as natural language processing has made impressive advances. They are great to demo and are fun to play with but I can\u2019t help but wonder whether this is just an endless march towards further marginal utility, not \u201cthe future.\u201d\n\nI will be watching to see what Google releases, my colleague Brian has summed up some of his expectations for the Pixel event.\n\nSend me feedback\n\non Twitter @lucasmtny or email\n\nlucas@techcrunch.com\n\nOn to the rest of the week\u2019s news.\n\nTrends of the week\n\nHere are a few big news items from big companies, with green links to all the sweet, sweet added context:\n\nApple pulls HKMap from App Store\n\nApple has found itself smack dab in the middle of a PR crisis that\u2019s pissing off pretty much everybody. Apple\u2019s app store approval, rejection, approval and seemingly final rejection of HKMap has been quite the saga.\n\nApple has found itself smack dab in the middle of a PR crisis that\u2019s pissing off pretty much everybody.
