It\u2019s where I spent my formative teenage years, it gave me the accent I still have and Carmarthenshire is where my parents and extended family are all from. Unlike Haverfordwest, the Carmarthenshire of my youth was majority Welsh-speaking, and the language of our family gatherings has always been entirely Welsh.\n\nThis occasionally surprises people from more anglicised parts of Wales, but it was, and still is, as natural as wrapping sandwiches in tinfoil or lying to your dentist about how often you floss.\n\nMy dad\u2019s print works wasn\u2019t just a business \u2013 it was an ink-spattered dream factory | Emma Jane Unsworth Read more\n\nOne of my favourite things about Wales is the extreme pride people have in the towns and villages they grew up in. On an away trip to watch Wales play football in Moldova, I asked a fellow fan where he was from. \u201cCilfynydd,\u201d the man replied (population 2,855), before adding: \u201cCentre of the fucking universe.\u201d In fact, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d is the default ice-breaker when Welsh people meet, especially abroad. Like most Welsh people, I have a mental Rolodex of things to say about each town and village I come across, facts I can feel in my bones and which I blurt out involuntarily. \u201cAaaah, Treforest,\u201d I\u2019ll nod. \u201cI know it. It\u2019s where Tom Jones was born and it\u2019s got a massive Tesco.\u201d It\u2019s therefore predictable that I absolutely love Carmarthen (known simply as \u201cTown\u201d to its residents), and I can get quite chippy if anyone from elsewhere criticises it.\n\nTown can justifiably claim to be Wales\u2019s oldest town, and has one of only two surviving Roman amphitheatres in Wales. The amphitheatre serves almost as many purposes today as it would have done in the second century, attracting both history buffs and teenagers who like snogging and drinking cans. As a history undergraduate, I always thought a Carmarthenshire upbringing was perfect preparation for the aspiring Welsh historian, with its historic mix of heavy industry and agriculture, rural villages and urban towns. I now think Carmarthen provides the perfect upbringing for comedy, as it\u2019s small enough for everyone to know each other but big enough to sustain plenty of \u201ccharacters\u201d.\n\nCarmarthen is resolutely unpretentious, which I think affected the kind of comedy I write, as in the early years I\u2019d try to give my ideas \u201cthe Carmarthen test\u201d \u2013 would the people I\u2019d known growing up laugh at this? In 1999, at the age of 18, I entered a standup competition and won \u00a3150. News of my winnings spread around town like wildfire, and a few days after the competition a curious townie who I vaguely knew approached me outside the Angel Vaults pub with an inquiring look on his face. \u201cNoodle told me that you won \u00a3150 for getting your knob out on stage in a comedy competition,\u201d he said, the sophistication of my performance having been lost slightly in Carmarthen\u2019s bush telegraph. \u201cIs that true?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d I responded, \u201cI was actually doing standup, so in fact there was an awful lot of craft in what \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019d get my knob out for free,\u201d he added, before dropping his trousers in Nott Square. He then stood there, satisfied that he had his penis out in the street for creative reasons rather than piffling financial concerns, as I sipped my pint and wondered if anything like this had ever happened to Monty Python after their first gigs.\n\nI\u2019d been doing standup for 10 years before I wrote a show in my first language. I talked a bit about Wales in my English set, and some of your references don\u2019t always land when you\u2019ve been to a Welsh-medium school. There was definitely something missing, a part of my personality I was unable to express satisfactorily in English. So writing a standup show in Welsh for the first time was an uplifting experience. Rather than simply translate my English material, I decided to deliberately concentrate on the parts of Welsh culture and my upbringing that didn\u2019t translate into English, knowing they would chime with a Welsh-speaking audience.\n\nI went to a Welsh-language school, a Welsh-language Sunday school (only until I was about 14 \u2013 I was actually pretty cool), and did all of the normal things a boy growing up in a small town does. I played a lot of football and collected stickers and watched too much telly, but it was the cultural differences that set Carmarthen apart that I tried to find humour in, because I wanted to write jokes that a Welsh-language audience would find unique to them.\n\nI talked about how impossibly hard the questions on my chapel\u2019s annual treasure hunt were, and the minefield of having to go to Welsh Language Society gigs to meet girls. The complexities of interpreting the subtle facial cues and signals of the opposite sex is difficult enough when you\u2019re 15, but was this pretty girl from Crymych flirting or did she actually want to discuss the 1993 Welsh Language Act? Surely no one does? Don\u2019t you just pretend you do, because you don\u2019t want to look too predatory and we were all given a leaflet about it on the way in?\n\nMy children are teaching me to love the housing estate I fled | Lynsey Hanley Read more\n\nIt was fun to comedically explore some of the things I had thought as a teenager (girls from Aberystwyth are glamorous, everyone from Llanelli has a hard brother), and as someone who grew up as a townie, to discuss the phenomenon of the \u201chambon\u201d (it would be \u201cjoscyn\u201d in north Wales) \u2013 the term for Welsh-speaking farmers who live in rural west Wales.\n\nA tricky first gig in Welsh knocked my confidence, so the euphoria I felt when I eventually started getting laughs from this new material was unlike anything I\u2019d ever known in my career. It really clicked for the first time at a show in Swansea, and I drove home, banging the dashboard of my car with delight.\n\nIt\u2019s a profound experience, finally getting to make jokes about your life in the language those things happened in, to an audience who have shared similar cultural experiences. I still love performing in English. But now I don\u2019t have this nagging feeling that I\u2019m only able to tell part of my story. A story that thanks to an upbringing in Carmarthen needs to be told in two languages.\n\n\u2022 Elis James is a standup comedian. You can hear him on the Elis James and John Robins show on BBC Radio 5 Live, every Friday, 1-3pm. He is going on a Welsh-language standup tour in the autumn (elisjames.co)\n\n\u2022 The caption on this article was amended on 6 September 2019 because Holly Walsh had been misidentified", "description": "My standup act won \u00a3150 \u2013 and made me realise how funny life in a Welsh town can be, says comedian Elis James", "authors": ["Elis James"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a37d3465fbe5d471ae30c8a8535c14561a2b1937/0_1739_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b4366893ccc43d95414b489a11faed1e", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
