Post partum pads aren\u2019t hot. Stay home and rest your body and bond with your baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just cannot imagine wanting to go party a few days after giving birth,\u201d someone wrote on the Daily Mail\u2019s story.\n\nAnother reader quipped, \u201c\u2018Never letting go\u2019... except 5 days after you\u2019re born to go party. Babies need their mommies 24/7 when first born. Sad.\u201d\n\nThat last one was a dig at the sweet caption that Mitchell used for the first photo she shared of her baby girl on Monday.\n\nMitchell, who experienced a devastating miscarriage last year and documented much of her pregnancy on her YouTube series, Almost Ready, actually didn\u2019t say exactly when her daughter was born. She also hasn\u2019t revealed the baby\u2019s name yet.\n\nHer fans and friends, including Vanessa Hudgens and Nikki Reed, gushed over the Instagram photo of her baby girl\u2019s tiny hands. Lots of heart emojis were posted and congratulations were shared.\n\nThe comments on that one were, overall, much nicer, although we imagine that she\u2019s too in love with her daughter to care.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
