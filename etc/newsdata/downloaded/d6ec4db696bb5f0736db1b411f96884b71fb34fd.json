As a result, he and husband Aaron (Danny Miller) decided to go on the run together before the police could catch up with Robert.\n\nWhen Robert learned that Victoria (Isabel Hodgins) had been raped, he decided to seek revenge on behalf of his sister. As a result, he went to great lengths to antagonise Lee, and things got out of hand several months back when he picked up a shovel and hit the rapist on the back of the head. Robert was charged with a GBH with intent and, as he\u2019s facing a stretch in prison, he\u2019s been making the most of what time he has left with Aaron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, things went from bad to worse tonight, as an emotional Victoria headed round to her brother\u2019s house to inform him that Lee had died. Robert was stunned, and didn\u2019t know how best to proceed. However, it was Liv (Isobel Steele) who provided them with an answer, when she suggested that both him and Aaron go on the run.\n\nRobert was clear that he didn\u2019t want Aaron to have to face life on the run, but he had no choice in the matter, as Aaron had already made up his mind.\n\nLater, Aaron informed Chas (Lucy Pargeter) of his plan and, while she was adamant that he was making a mistake, he was determined to stand by his husband.\n\nAs the episode drew to a conclusion, an emotional Victoria bid farewell to Robert, as both he and Aaron exited their home. They said one final emotional farewell to their nearest and dearest before getting into the car and driving off.\n\nThe question is: will the pair manage to evade the law?\n\nWith Lee having died as a result of the injuries Robert inflicted on him, the police will no doubt come calling real soon, and when they realise he\u2019s gone, it\u2019s likely that they\u2019ll pull out all the stops to locate him.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, a recent trailer showed both Aaron and Robert hiding \u2014 seemingly from a police car\u2014 so they\u2019re not out of the woods just yet.\n\nEmmerdale continues on Tuesday 15th October at 7pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "But do they manage to get away?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/15_10_emm_robert_aaron_leave_01sssffgsffgfgfggssgsss-39bc_1571164883.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
