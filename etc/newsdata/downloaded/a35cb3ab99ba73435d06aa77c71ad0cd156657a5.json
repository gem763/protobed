Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.\n\nA high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for Tradelink Electronic Commerce. It would not be a surprise to discover that many investors buy it for the dividends. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nSEHK:536 Historical Dividend Yield, October 30th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. In the last year, Tradelink Electronic Commerce paid out 86% of its profit as dividends. It's paying out most of its earnings, which limits the amount that can be reinvested in the business. This may indicate limited need for further capital within the business, or highlight a commitment to paying a dividend.\n\nWe also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Tradelink Electronic Commerce paid out 116% of its free cash last year. Cash flows can be lumpy, but this dividend was not well covered by cash flow. Tradelink Electronic Commerce paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough free cash flow to cover the dividend. Were it to repeatedly pay dividends that were not well covered by cash flow, this could be a risk to Tradelink Electronic Commerce's ability to maintain its dividend.\n\nWhile the above analysis focuses on dividends relative to a company's earnings, we do note Tradelink Electronic Commerce's strong net cash position, which will let it pay larger dividends for a time, should it choose.\n\nWe update our data on Tradelink Electronic Commerce every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Tradelink Electronic Commerce's dividend payments. The dividend has been cut by more than 20% on at least one occasion historically. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was HK$0.091 in 2009, compared to HK$0.095 last year. Its dividends have grown at less than 1% per annum over this time frame.\n\nModest growth in the dividend is good to see, but we think this is offset by historical cuts to the payments. It is hard to live on a dividend income if the company's earnings are not consistent.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nStory continues", "description": "Dividend paying stocks like Tradelink Electronic Commerce Limited (HKG:536) tend to be popular with investors, and for...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KtWR6Wn9KZowyicngPxZag--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/8d586a1c447759d5753ae3bd6fb5417e", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
