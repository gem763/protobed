Who could succeed Theresa May as Conservative leader? 1/9 Boris Johnson Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has long been hopeful, he previously stood in the leadership contest that followed the Brexit vote and has at many times since been thought to be maneuvering himself towards the goal. He remains a darling of the party's right wing, particularly those in the ERG, and is the most popular choice among Tory voters but his leadership bid would be fiercely opposed by many MPs PA 2/9 Michael Gove Environment secretary Michael Gove is another member who has long wanted to be leader. He has lately been known for rousing his party in the commons, his recent speeches on the Brexit deal and Labour's no confidence motion have overshadowed the Prime Minister's. He has been loyal to the Prime Minister, partly to shed his reputation as a backstabber who abandoned Boris Johnson to stand against him in the 2016 leadership election Getty 3/9 Dominic Raab Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab has emerged as a favourite to be the Brexiteer candidate in a contest to succeed to Ms May. He displayed a grip on detail in his role as Brexit secretary. When asked recently if he would like to become prime minister he replied \"never say never\" Getty 4/9 Rory Stewart International development secretary Rory Stewart is pitching himself as the sensible candidate, promising to rule out both a second referendum and a no-deal Brexit. He was only recently promoted to the cabinet, previously serving as prisons minister, where he caught headlines with a pledge to resign if he could not reduce levels of violence within a year PA 5/9 Esther McVey The former work and pensions secretary announced that she will be standing for the leadership when May leaves. McVey is the first to explicitly state that she intends to stand. She resigned from the cabinet in protest over May's Brexit deal AFP/Getty 6/9 Sajid Javid Home secretary Sajid Javid is said to have a plan in place for a leadership race. He made headlines over Christmas when he declared that people smuggling over the English channel was a \"major incident\" and more recently when he revoked the citizenship of ISIS bride Shamima Begum. Son of a bus driver, he wants the Conservatives to be seen as the party of social mobility PA 7/9 Jeremy Hunt Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt was recently thought to be the favourite in the event of a leadership race as he could sell himself as the man to unite the party. Critics worry that his long stint as health secretary could return to haunt him at a general election. He has reportedly been holding meetings with Tory MPs over breakfast to promote his leadership PA 8/9 Andrea Leadsom Following the Prime Minister's second defeat over her Brexit deal, Leader of the house Andrea Leadsom hosted a dinner party at which \"leadership was the only topic of conversation\", The Times heard. Leadsom ran against Theresa May in the 2016 leadership election before dropping out, allowing May to become Prime Minister AFP/Getty 9/9 Priti Patel Former international development secretary Priti Patel is thought to be positioning herself as a contender. One MP told The Independent \"she knows she's from the right of the party, the part which is going to choose the next leader, so she's reminding everyone she's there.\" Patel left the government late in 2017 after it emerged that she had held undisclosed meetings with Israeli officials PA 1/9 Boris Johnson Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has long been hopeful, he previously stood in the leadership contest that followed the Brexit vote and has at many times since been thought to be maneuvering himself towards the goal.

We continue to seek to agree a way forward in order to secure our orderly withdrawal from the EU.\u201d\n\nTuesday's Cabinet meeting is expected to feature a substantial debate on the state of talks, with some Tories warning that Ms May has no prospect of securing a deal which could win the backing of her own party.\n\nSome urged her to stand down after the May 23 Euro-elections, which polls suggest will deliver a drubbing for her party.\n\nThe latest YouGov study for The Times put the Tories on just 10 per cent for the European poll, in an unprecedented fifth place behind Liberal Democrats and Greens. Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party enjoyed a comfortable lead on 34 per cent, ahead of Labour's 16 per cent.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

No, it's worse than that.\u201d\n\nLeading Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg hit out at the \"complete vacuum of leadership\" at Westminster, and pleaded with Tory voters to stick with the party in order to provide a base for a new leader to rebuild.\n\nAnd former minister Ed Vaizey said Ms May should go after the Euro-elections, naming Michael Gove as his preferred replacement.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I can see that would keep her in office would be if by some miracle she can produce a deal with Labour and argue that she needs time to see if she can get it through Parliament,\u201d he told Channel 4 News.\n\nJeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said it was \"crunch week\" for the cross-party negotiations, but rejected the possibility of a second referendum as \u201ca betrayal of what people voted for\u201d.\n\nBut Sir Keir Starmer, warned it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to get an agreement through Parliament without the promise of a confirmatory ballot, as up to 150 Labour MPs would reject it.\n\nAnd Mr Watson said it would be \u201cvery, very difficult\u201d to construct a deal which could secure Commons approval without a referendum.\n\nIn direct contradiction of close Corbyn ally Barry Gardiner\u2019s insistence that Labour was \u201cnot a remain party\u201d, Mr Watson said it was \u201ca remain and reform party\u201d in the context of the Euro-elections.\n\nTheir stance puts them at odds with Mr Corbyn\u2019s position that a second referendum remains an option only to prevent no-deal or a \u201cdamaging Tory Brexit\u201d.\n\nOne Labour opponent of a People\u2019s Vote, backbencher Stephen Kinnock, warned that talks risk being \u201ctorpedoed\u201d if Labour introduced an \u201cadditional red line\u201d of a second referendum.\n\nCampaigning in Labour MP Yvette Cooper\u2019s West Yorkshire constituency, Mr Farage denounced calls for a confirmatory referendum as \u201cthe most outrageous proposal I've ever seen\u201d.\n\nHe said Labour was \u201cvulnerable in the most extraordinary way\u201d in Leave areas and predicted a second referendum could pave the way for a Brexit Party majority at the next general election.", "description": "Cross-party talks on a compromise Brexit deal are hanging in the balance, with Theresa May expected to come under pressure at Tuesday's Cabinet to pull the plug.
