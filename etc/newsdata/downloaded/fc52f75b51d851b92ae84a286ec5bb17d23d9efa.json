Schiff (D-Calif.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on next steps.\n\nAD\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Karoun Demirjian and Rachael Bade\n\n10:45 a.m.: Kent is appearing under subpoena\n\nKent was subpoenaed to appear Tuesday morning after an attempt by the State Department, in coordination with the White House, to block his testimony, according to an official working on the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door session, said Kent is complying with the subpoena issued by the House Intelligence Committee and answering questions from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers and staff.\n\n10:15 a.m.: Former Pompeo adviser set to testify Wednesday\n\nAD\n\nMichael McKinley, the former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, will testify before House investigators leading the impeachment inquiry on Wednesday morning, according to people familiar with the decision.\n\nAD\n\nMcKinley resigned last week amid worsening morale at the State Department and widespread concern that Pompeo has done little to defend diplomats who became ensnared in efforts by Trump to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nMcKinley will come to the Hill with an intimate understanding of how Pompeo wielded power in the highest echelons of the State Department, given his proximity to the top diplomat on his many trips abroad.\n\nThe format for the testimony is a \u201ctranscribed interview,\u201d said a congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss matters not yet made public, which places fewer restrictions on the interview process than in a formal deposition.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMcKinley is one of several current and former State Department officials who have defied White House orders to avoid testifying before House investigators. On Tuesday morning, Kent arrived on Capitol Hill to testify.

I knew it at the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI will prove beyond any doubt it came from the United States of America.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGiuliani had previously said he worked for Fraud Guarantee in 2018 and 2019 but had not confirmed how much he was paid, a figure that was first reported by Reuters. The payment means Giuliani\u2019s firm was earning $500,000 from Parnas just as Giuliani began working closely with Parnas and a business partner, Igor Fruman, to dig up dirt on Democrats in Ukraine.\n\nThe information the three men collected prompted Trump to press Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden, prompting the Trump impeachment inquiry by the House.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Josh Dawsey and Rosalind S. Helderman\n\n9:45 a.m.: Trump complains about lack of \u2018transparency\u2019 in proceedings\n\nPresident Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday morning to complain that witnesses in the impeachment inquiry are being deposed behind closed doors.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDemocrats are allowing no transparency at the Witch Hunt hearings,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cIf Republicans ever did this they would be excoriated by the Fake News. Let the facts come out from the charade of people, most of whom I do not know, they are interviewing for 9 hours each, not selective leaks.\u201d\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) has said that transcripts of depositions will be released and that some witnesses may be called back to testify publicly.\n\nDemocrats argue that private depositions are advantageous because it is harder for witnesses to coordinate their accounts.\n\n9:40 a.m.: Kent arrives at Capitol ahead of scheduled testimony\n\nKent made no comment to reporters as he arrived at the Capitol. He has been summoned to testify about a campaign by Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens.\n\n9:10 a.m.: Zeldin claims coverage of depositions are based on \u2018cherry-picked leaks\u2019\n\nRepublicans renewed complaints Tuesday morning about depositions being held behind closed doors and again called for opening the process to the public.\n\nRep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) said that media coverage of what occurred Monday was based on \u201ccherry-picked leaks\u201d by Democrats and that House investigators should \u201cat least release the transcripts\u201d of those being deposed.\n\nAppearing on Fox News, Zeldin also took aim at Schiff (D-Calif.).\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff is making it up every single morning as he goes along,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cThere are no rules.\u201d\n\nDuring an appearance Monday night in New York, Schiff said lawmakers \u201care going to be releasing all of these transcripts\u201d of the depositions.\n\nHe said some witnesses who have testified behind closed doors may be brought back for an open hearing.\n\n8:45 a.m.: Sean Spicer says scrutiny of Hunter Biden is justified\n\nFormer White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday that scrutiny of Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings is justified, citing the scrutiny that the business dealings of Trump\u2019s children has received.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the scrutiny with the Trump family and all of their business dealings.

This is fair game,\u201d Spicer added.\n\nSpicer said he sees a \u201cbig difference\u201d between the business activities of the Trump children and the service of Hunter Biden on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no expertise in the field,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing except for your last name, and frankly, not just your last name, but your connection to the sitting vice president, who\u2019s overseeing the policy in that country.\u201d\n\n8 a.m.: Top State Department official expected to face questions about Ukraine and Giuliani\n\nKent is expected to testify Tuesday morning in the House impeachment inquiry of Trump. He is a key witness on whether Giuliani tried to push out the former ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nThe longtime Foreign Service official has been summoned for a deposition in the investigation, with Democrats expected to question him behind closed doors about a campaign by Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into investigating Biden and his son.\n\nA lawyer for Kent did not respond to emails asking whether he intended to answer the summons \u2014 though Democrats were ready to subpoena him if he did not.\n\nGiuliani accused Yovanovitch and Kent, formerly the No. 2 ranking diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, of trying to protect the Bidens from an investigation by Ukrainian prosecutors. Yovanovitch adamantly pushed back on those accusations during testimony before investigators on Friday. Kent also is likely to be asked about those assertions.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Rachael Bade\n\n7:30 a.m.: Bolton declines comment on testimony that he was alarmed by Giuliani\n\nJohn Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, declined to comment Tuesday on reports that Fiona Hill, the White House\u2019s former top Russia adviser, told impeachment investigators Monday that he was alarmed by Giuliani\u2019s activities in Ukraine.\n\nHill testified behind closed doors Monday that Bolton was furious over Giuliani\u2019s politically motivated activities in Ukraine, according to two officials familiar with her testimony. She recounted how Bolton likened the former New York mayor to a \u201chand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up,\u201d one of these people said, after Bolton learned about Giuliani\u2019s Ukraine campaign.\n\nHouse investigators are now considering summoning Bolton, who was Hill\u2019s direct superior at the National Security Council, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss closed-door deliberations.\n\n\u2014 Anne Gearan\n\n7:25 a.m.: George Conway pushes back on Republican demands to hear from whistleblower\n\nGeorge Conway, the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, pushed back against Trump and fellow Republicans who have expressed alarm in recent days that Democrats may not seek testimony from the whistleblower whose complaint sparked the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cSomeone calls 911 because they hear shots down the street at the bank,\u201d tweeted Conway, a conservative lawyer and frequent Trump critic. \u201cThe cops show up at the bank, and, sure enough, it\u2019s been robbed, and there are numerous witnesses there who saw the crime. The suspects confess. Normally, at this point, no one cares about who called 911.\u201d\n\n7:15 a.m.: RNC highlights effort aimed at House Democrats in swing districts\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel highlighted the RNC\u2019s expanded efforts to target Democrats in swing districts for their support of the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cDemocrats in Congress are hiding their baseless impeachment \u2018hearings\u2019 behind closed doors, but they can\u2019t hide from their constituents!\u201d McDaniel wrote in a tweet that included a link to a Washington Examiner piece detailing a $2.3 million RNC effort that includes online ads with a \u201cStop the Madness\u201d theme targeting 30 House Democrats.\n\n7:10 a.m.: Jordan takes aim at Hunter Biden\n\nAs ABC was airing its Hunter Biden interview, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a key Trump ally, appeared on Fox News, where he criticized Biden\u2019s tenure on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president.\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t fair. This wasn\u2019t proper. This wasn\u2019t right,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cWe just know that this stuff smells.\u201d\n\nJordan also took issue with Hunter Biden\u2019s assessment in the interview about whether he would have been offered the position on the board of Burisma Holdings if his last name weren\u2019t Biden.\n\nHunter Biden told ABC \u201cprobably not.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot probably not, definitely not,\u201d said Jordan, who went on to criticize the Democratic-led impeachment proceedings as \u201can all-out attack on the president.\u201d\n\n6:30 a.m.: Hunter Biden concedes mistake but not an \u2018ethical lapse\u2019\n\nHunter Biden conceded in a television interview that aired Tuesday that it might have been a mistake to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president, but he insisted that he did not have an \u201cethical lapse.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah,\u201d Biden said on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d referring to the fallout from his service. \u201cBut did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden, whose tenure on the company, Burisma Holdings, began in 2014, said he didn\u2019t foresee that his work would become central to a political controversy. Trump and Giuliani have pressed the idea that Joe Biden\u2019s efforts as vice president to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor was tied to the fact that he had examined the company.\n\n\u201cWhat I regret is not taking into account that there would be a Rudy Giuliani and a president of the United States that would be listening to this, this ridiculous conspiracy idea, which has ... been completely debunked by everyone,\u201d Hunter Biden said.\n\n\u201cI gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That\u2019s where I made the mistake,\u201d he added.\n\nRead more here.\n\n6 a.m.: Democrats to huddle Tuesday night on status of inquiry\n\nComing off a two-week recess, House Democrats plan to huddle at 6 p.m. Tuesday to discuss the status of the impeachment inquiry, according to a Democratic aide.\n\nIt\u2019s been three weeks since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced the launch of the formal inquiry.
