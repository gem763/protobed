Of what we\u2019ve seen so far, one of the more notable changes is that Google will require new Android devices to be compatible with USB-C PD chargers.\n\nUSB-C PD is an open standard for USB-C that allows for fast charging speeds. But as is often the case with new standards, it\u2019s something that some manufacturers have skirted in favor of proprietary fast-charging methods. According to testing done by Android Authority, OnePlus\u2019 Warp Charge, Samsung\u2019s Fast Charge, and other technologies haven\u2019t played nicely with third-party accessories in the past. In order to get the advertised speeds, you had to use the chargers that came in the box.\n\nXDA Developers points out at Android 7 Nougat\u2019s launch, Google merely suggested that developers shy away from proprietary charging methods, and that, someday, it \u201cmight require all type-C devices to support full interoperability with standard type-C chargers.\u201d Now, it has supposedly made it mandatory moving forward.\n\nThese changes supposedly went into effect on September 3rd, 2019\n\nAnother big change is the requirement of Digital Wellbeing, Google\u2019s tools introduced in Android 9 Pie that can monitor app usage and notifications, adjust your screen\u2019s color profile to reduce eye fatigue, and more, as well as its Family Link parental controls that help parents monitor and control their family\u2019s devices.\n\nAccording to the document, manufacturers must implement these features into new phones and tablets using Android 9 or Android 10 moving forward, and that devices updated to either operating system after September 3rd, 2019 must also contain these features. The document supposedly states that Google will accept custom solutions from manufacturers, so long as they offer the same feature set as Digital Wellbeing and Family Link.\n\nGiven that the document obtained by XDA Developers has been chock-full of interesting details, I expect more news to follow soon. We\u2019ll be updating this post once more findings have been published.", "description": "According to a document obtained by XDA Developers, Google is tightening the rules for phones and tablets running Android 9 Pie and Android 10.
