The show was nominated for 32 awards \u2013 the most for any single season of television ever \u2013 and had already won 10 Creative Arts Emmys last week. Game of Thrones took home the night\u2019s final prize for outstanding drama series and a best supporting actor nod for American star Peter Dinklage \u2013 bringing its total to 12 awards and breaking its own 2015 record for the most awards per series \u2013 but was otherwise shut out of the telecast.\n\nEmmy winners 2019: the full list Read more\n\nInstead, Fleabag emerged as the night\u2019s big winner, upstaging Veep, HBO\u2019s other Emmys mainstay in its final season, and last year\u2019s darling The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. Fleabag, which originated as Waller-Bridge\u2019s one-woman show at the Edinburgh festival fringe, took home the awards for outstanding writing, best comedy series and best directing. Waller-Bridge also claimed lead actress in a comedy series \u2013 a surprise win over Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who would have become the most decorated Emmys performer of all time had she won a ninth award for her role as Selina Meyer on Veep.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jodie Comer.

Chernobyl, HBO and Sky Television\u2019s brutal, critically acclaimed limited series on the 1986 nuclear disaster, won for best writing, best directing and best overall for limited series. John Oliver won his fourth consecutive Emmy for best variety series for Last Week Tonight, and Jesse Armstrong took home best drama writing for HBO\u2019s upstart Succession. Black Mirror\u2019s choose-your-own-adventure flick Bandersnatch also won for best television movie.\n\nIn a hostless awards show packed with more awards than anything else, perhaps the most stirring moment of the night was Michelle Williams\u2019s speech for best lead actress in a limited series (Fosse/Verdon), in which she heralded gender pay equity. \u201cMy bosses never presumed to know better than I did about what I needed in order to do my job and honor Gwen Verdon,\u201d said Williams, now an outspoken activist for gender pay equity following the revelation \u2013 to herself and the public \u2013 that she was paid significantly less than costar Mark Wahlberg in the movie All the Money in the World. \u201cThe next time a woman, and especially a woman of color \u2013 because she stands to make 52 cents on the dollar compared to her white, male counterpart \u2013 tells you what she needs in order to do her job, listen to her,\u201d Williams said to some tears from the audience.\n\n\u201cBelieve her, because one day she might stand in front of you and say thank you for allowing [her] to succeed because of her workplace environment and not in spite of it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jharrel Jerome wins lead actor in a drama series.

Arquette dedicated the award to her sister Alexis, a trans woman who died in 2016, and urged an end to discrimination of trans people. \u201cGive them jobs. Let\u2019s get rid of this bias that we have everywhere,\u201d she said.\n\nOutside of the Brits, other highlights of the evening included two nods to The Marvelous Mrs Maisel \u2013 Tony Shalhoub and Alex Borstein for supporting actor and actress in a comedy series, respectively \u2013 and an underdog win for Ozark\u2019s Julia Garner as best supporting actress, besting Danaerys Targaryen herself, Emilia Clarke.\n\nGame of Thrones still got its recognition, however, as a portion of its massive cast and crew took the stage for the night\u2019s biggest honor. Given all the fire and ice, dragons and long shoots, \u201cit is amazing that all of you are still alive\u201d, said co-showrunner DB Weiss. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we finished it.\u201d", "description": "Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s comedy was the surprise victor while the final season of HBO\u2019s fantasy drama picked up the most awards", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baa966e48356ec7312449f83317e12cf4ec89786/0_79_3933_2358/master/3933.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8c9252a36979cdb906a1f2ee19e0a8e5", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
