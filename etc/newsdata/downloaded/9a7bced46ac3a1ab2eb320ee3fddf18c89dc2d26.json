Both alleged incidents are part of the same criminal case.\n\nHe is charged with one count of forcible touching and one count of sexual abuse, which are misdemeanors, in connection with each alleged incident.\n\nCuba Gooding Jr charged with forcible touching after incident in New York Read more\n\nGooding, 51, won a best supporting actor Oscar in 1997 for the film Jerry Maguire and is known for roles in movies including A Few Good Men and The Butler and in the television miniseries The People v O J Simpson.\n\nProsecutors said at a hearing in Manhattan supreme court on Tuesday that they hope to establish a pattern of behavior at Gooding\u2019s trial using testimony from 12 additional women who have said they were subjected to unwanted touching and advances by the actor in bars and clubs.\n\nNo criminal charges have been brought in connection with those additional women.\n\nMark Heller, Gooding\u2019s attorney, told reporters outside the courthouse on Tuesday that he would seek to have the two alleged groping incidents tried separately. Heller expressed confidence that his client would not be convicted, and said prosecutors had brought the new indictment because they were not ready to go to trial with their original case.\n\nGooding had been scheduled to go to trial on the original charges on Thursday, but the additional charges mean the trial will be delayed. No new trial date has been set.\n\nGooding, who is divorced, is one of dozens of men in politics, entertainment, sports and the business world who have been accused of sexual misconduct since allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein triggered the #MeToo movement.\n\nWeinstein is scheduled to stand trial in New York in January on charges of rape and assault involving two women. He has denied any non-consensual sex.", "description": "The actor was accused of pinching a woman\u2019s buttocks and, in a separate incident, groping another woman\u2019s breasts", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa3657bafb26616b0fa1e96fedc595aced9228e5/0_161_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d77614946b214eaa12b83b3182ea409a", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
