Your move, Ed.\n\nTravis Perkins\n\nIt's an important third-quarter update for Travis Perkins on Tuesday, amid fears of an economic slump, scribblers at Peel Hunt say.\n\nThey reckon the builders' merchant is making operational improvements, but fears most of these 'will be lost to tougher trading'.\n\nAny details on plans to split off Wickes could soften the blow for investors, but if Travis paints a gloomy picture it could hit shares in rivals such as Kingfisher.\n\nAmazon\n\nShares in Amazon have taken a hit since it announced weak second-quarter results in July.\n\nSo it is now some way off the 'world's largest listed company' status, jointly held by Apple and Microsoft, which both have a market capital of just over $1 trillion (\u00a3750 billion).\n\nBut strong third-quarter data on Thursday could help its stock recover. Earnings of $4.46 a share are expected \u2013 down 22 per cent on last year. The key is if it can beat that consensus figure.", "description": "He may have lost the battle for a seat on the board, but activist investor Edward Bramson hasn't given up on forcing change at Barclays just yet.", "authors": ["Jamie Nimmo For The Financial Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
