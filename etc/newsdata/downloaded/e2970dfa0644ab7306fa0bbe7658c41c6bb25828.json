Can you take kids? We have answers", "language": "en", "text": "Asbury Park Press\n\nThe boys are back.\n\nJay and Silent Bob, the Jersey Shore stoner duo introduced by writer/director Kevin Smith in his landmark 1994 debut \"Clerks,\" return to the big screen this week via Fathom Events with \"Jay and Silent Bob Reboot.\" The duo, who made a surprise cameo in Drake's \"I'm Upset\" video, were last seen in theaters in 2006's \"Clerks II.\"\n\nWith Jason Mewes returning as Jay and Smith himself as Silent Bob, this is a film that fans have been waiting more than a decade for. We're here to bring you up to speed with a spoiler-free preview.\n\nSo what's it about?\n\nElements from across Smith's View Askew interconnected cinematic universe are at play here: As established in Smith's \"Chasing Amy\" (1997), Central Jersey drug dealers Jay and Silent Bob are the inspiration for the comic book series \"Bluntman and Chronic.\" \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" (2001) found them traveling to Hollywood in an attempt to stop a \"Bluntman and Chronic\" movie from being made.\n\nNow, almost 20 years later, the dynamic duo learn that a \"Bluntman and Chronic\" reboot is in the works, set to be directed by none other than ... Kevin Smith. Our heroes hit the road again in a film that has plenty of thoughts on our nostalgia-centric modern popular culture.\n\nWhich movies do you need to see first?\n\nYou could probably go into \"Reboot\" having never seen any other Kevin Smith movie, but you'd miss out on a lot of the deep-cut jokes. If you're short on time, you'll want to at least watch or re-watch \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" and \"Mallrats\" (1995).\n\nTo truly maximize your Easter egg fun, though, add \"Chasing Amy\" to the list.\n\nAnd though you don't need to see it to understand \"Reboot,\" but it's worth checking out \"Clerks,\" Smith's excellent first entry into his View Askew universe.\n\nWho's in it?\n\nNo spoilers here, so let's just say a lot of people. Quite a few cameos are seen in the trailer \u2013 and on Smith's Instagram page.\n\nHere's a suggestion, though: One of the funniest bits starts up around the 1 hour, 10 minute mark, so don't choose that time to go to the bathroom or get popcorn. You're welcome.\n\nWhere can you see it?\n\nFathom Events will show the movie in select theaters on Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nFollowing the Fathom screenings, Smith and Mewes will take the film on tour for the \"Jay and Silent Bob Reboot Roadshow,\" kicking off with a home state show on Oct. 19 at the Paramount Theatre in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The tour is currently slated to run through Feb. 26 in New Orleans.\n\nIs it appropriate for kids?\n\nThis movie is very much not appropriate for kids: It's rated R.\n\nSmith and Mewes have included their children in the film \u2013 actually, Smith's entire family, even his dog, are in \"Reboot\" \u2013 but no, you don't want to include yours when you go see it.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nFollowing \"Jay and Silent Bob Reboot,\" Smith will return to the View Askew universe with a third \"Clerks\" film. Mewes and Smith are set to return as Jay and Silent Bob alongside returning \"Clerks\" stars Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson as Dante Hicks and Randal Graves, respectively.\n\n\"I've traveled the world on the backs of Dante and Randal and Jay and Silent Bob; they're as real to me as raincoats,\" Smith told the Asbury Park (N.J.) Press in August. \"I know they're fictional characters in a movie but those individuals \u2013 who, granted, I created \u2013 are responsible for presenting me to the world, giving me a job, giving me something to do for 25 years. So I feel like I owe them.\n\nWith \"Jay and Silent Bob Reboot,\" \"I get to pay back Jay and Silent Bob in a way of like (acknowledging that) these cats have taken me everywhere, so I'm giving them a movie where they get to do something special or grow up. ... The same, I think, is owed to Dante and Randal.\"\n\nSmith is also collaborating with Dave Willis, co-creator and writer of cult classic Adult Swim series \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force,\" on an animated \"Howard the Duck\" series for streaming service Hulu.\n\nHe's also set to serve as executive producer and showrunner for Netflix's \"He-Man\" series \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation.\"", "description": "Kevin Smith returns to his View Askew universe with \"Jay and Silent Bob Reboot,\" the characters' first appearance on the big screen since \"Clerks II.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/02/PAPP/fd67acab-d75d-4b3d-811d-6c97d16be7c9-JSB_1196.jpg?crop=5747,3233,x1,y20&width=3200&height=2134&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
