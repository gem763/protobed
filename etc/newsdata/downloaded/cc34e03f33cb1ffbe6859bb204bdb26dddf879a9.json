When I went to the High Court [acting as a judge], I could write proper or very good judgments,\" she said.\n\n\"Being in the district court, you are in the forefront, you are accessible to the community. In the High Court we are not that accessible, we speak to people through our judgments.\n\n\"That is why when I write my judgments, I use the simplest language so that anyone who comes across it can understand their rights and what I am trying to say.\"\n\nAccording to the Judges Matter website, Daniso completed her B.Proc at the University of Limpopo in 1996 and completed her LLB through the University of South Africa.\n\nWhile the Black Lawyers Association (BLA) raised concerns that she had acted for less than two terms in the High Court, adding that it did not support her appointment at this stage, Daniso defended herself and said that, while acting for five months, she had managed to write judgments in \"all\" sections of the High Court.\n\nShe said she did not believe that a competent woman judge should be delayed in getting an opportunity to be a judge so that she could do another acting stint.\n\nOther candidates who interviewed for the position on Thursday were Thiloshini Ramdeyal, who has been a regional magistrate for 14 years, and advocate Ilse van Rhyn.\n\nThe JSC did not recommend either of them for the position.\n\n", "description": "The Judicial Service Commission has recommended Nokuthula Sylvia Daniso to President Cyril Ramaphosa for a judge vacancy in the Free State High Court.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/775/c214fcf09b66452c9f1777078792767c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
