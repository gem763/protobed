The updated list of citizens, known as the National Register of Citizenship, was created with a view to target \u201cillegal immigration\u201d from the neighboring Muslim-majority Bangladesh.\n\nMr. Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has promised to carry out the exercise across India and \u201cremove every single infiltrator from the country, except Buddha, Hindus and Sikhs.\u201d It is a clear threat against every Dalit, Muslim, Christian and Jewish citizen of the country \u2014 the absolute opposite of the Gates Foundation\u2019s mission of considering all lives equal.\n\nAnd as I write, Mr. Modi\u2019s recent assault on Kashmir is foremost on my mind. Seven million people are currently under virtual incarceration in Indian-occupied Kashmir. That is my home, and those are my people. On Aug. 5, Mr. Modi\u2019s government unilaterally abrogated the semiautonomous status of Kashmir after placing the valley of Kashmir under a military siege and cutting off phone, internet and television connections.\n\nDespite Mr. Modi\u2019s rhetoric about bringing greater economic growth to Kashmir, the suffering of the people of Kashmiris has only been exacerbated by his actions. By Tuesday evening, as the Gates Foundation presented the award to Mr. Modi in Manhattan, Kashmir completed 51 days of being cut off from the rest of the world. There are reports of illegal detention and torture of teenagers, of night raids terrorizing families, sparing no one.\n\nMr. Modi\u2019s government is explicitly following what United Nations human rights experts have described as the \u201ccollective punishment\u201d of the people of Kashmir. The lockdown and the communications blackout has made it difficult for patients to reach hospitals and access lifesaving drugs in time. And it has banned foreign reporters from Kashmir.\n\nSeveral staff members at the Seattle and New Delhi offices of the foundation expressed their concerns about the decision to reward Mr. Modi, but the foundation publicly chose to normalize him. They claim that the award is \u201cspecifically for achievements in sanitation.\u201d\n\nAs world leaders meet at the United Nations General Assembly this week and questions are raised about Kashmir and Mr. Modi\u2019s policies in India, the Gates Foundation has provided him with a global platform to divert attention, to change the narrative. But the problem with the award wasn\u2019t merely its timing, which made it a public relations disaster for the foundation. The decision to honor Mr. Modi would be wrong on any date.", "description": "By honoring India\u2019s divisive and authoritarian prime minister Narendra Modi, the foundation is going against its professed belief of considering every life valuable.", "authors": ["Sabah Hamid"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/opinion/26Hamid-Sub/26Hamid-Sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
