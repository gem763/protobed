The suit was filed in federal court for the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nThe suit doesn\u2019t seek to prevent the distribution or sale of the book\u2014which could run afoul of First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech. Rather, the government is asking a court to seize the financial proceeds from the sale of \u201dPermanent Record\u201d as well as to enjoin Mr. Snowden, who has lived in Russia since 2013, from giving speeches related to the book.\n\n\u201cIntelligence information should protect our nation, not provide personal profit,\u201d said G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement. \u201cThis lawsuit will ensure that Edward Snowden receives no monetary benefits from breaching the trust placed in him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis book contains no government secrets that have not been previously published by respected news organizations,\u201d said Ben Wizner, an attorney for Mr. Snowden who runs the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s speech, privacy and technology project. \u201cHad Mr. Snowden believed that the government would review his book in good faith, he would have submitted it for review. But the government continues to insist that facts that are known and discussed throughout the world are still somehow classified.\u201d\n\nMacmillan, part of Germany\u2019s Holtzbrinck Publishing Group, referred to ACLU\u2019s statement and declined further comment.\n\nIn a tweet, Mr. Snowden noted the lawsuit over his book, and then linked to the Amazon.com listing for his memoir, saying: \u201cThis is the book the government does not want you to read.\u201d\n\nBy filing a civil lawsuit, the U.S. government could make Mr. Snowden\u2019s book financially unprofitable for his publisher. But the suit is also likely to garner more attention for Mr. Snowden\u2019s book, and could help boost its overall sales.\n\nTypically, government employees and contractors with access to classified information must submit any published works\u2014even works of fiction\u2014to their agency for pre-publication review. That restriction applies even after they leave government service. In its lawsuit, the government alleges that Mr. Snowden failed to do so\u2014violating his contractual obligations to both the CIA and the NSA, where he worked as a contractor.\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest effort by the Trump administration to crack down on leaks of classified information to reporters, a stepped-up campaign officials have spoken publicly about. Such efforts expanded greatly under the Obama administration, but the cases have accelerated in recent years. For example, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was indicted earlier this year for conspiring to hack a military computer and for violating the Espionage Act.\n\nIn 2013, Mr. Snowden leaked to journalists secret details about the National Security Agency\u2019s highly classified surveillance programs, prompting an international uproar over the scope of the U.S. electronic-spying capabilities. The revelations included the disclosure of a domestic phone surveillance program\u2014set up clandestinely shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks\u2014that collected in bulk the metadata records of unsuspecting Americans. Metadata include the numbers and time stamps of a call or text message but not the contents of the conversation.\n\nMr. Snowden\u2019s new book, which was distributed to reviewers and others ahead of its public release, doesn\u2019t contain any major new revelations about U.S. intelligence programs.\n\nMr. Snowden, 36 years old, has remained beyond the reach of U.S. law enforcement since fleeing the U.S. before the leaks were published. He faces U.S. criminal charges that he violated the Espionage Act for his theft and disclosure of top-secret intelligence programs. In a recent interview with CBS, Mr. Snowden said he would one day like to return to the U.S., but only if he could be guaranteed a fair trial in which he could argue his leaks served the public interest.\n\nMr. Snowden\u2019s disclosures had a significant impact on the public debate over intelligence collection and continue to affect public policy in the U.S. and abroad. Congress in 2015 passed a law, the USA Freedom Act, that effectively ended the bulk phone data collection program, replacing it with a narrower system under which the government can seek records from telecommunications company on an as-needed based with judicial approval.\n\nOn Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee will hold a public hearing with representatives from the NSA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation about intelligence programs, as lawmakers begin drafting legislation to renew surveillance provisions due to expire in December.\n\nThe committee is expected to introduce a bill in the coming weeks seeking to end the phone program entirely, according to congressional aides and other people familiar with the matter, amid revelations about ongoing compliance issues and a recognition within the intelligence agencies that the program contains little national security value.\n\nWrite to Dustin Volz at dustin.volz@wsj.com and Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com", "description": "The Justice Department argued Edward Snowden violated nondisclosure agreements by publishing a book about his 2013 disclosures of classified surveillance programs.", "authors": ["Dustin Volz", "Byron Tau", "Dustin.Volz Wsj.Com", "Byron.Tau Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107896/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
