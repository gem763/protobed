The podcast marks the third collaboration between Marvel and Stitcher, following Wolverine: The Long Night and its sequel Wolverine: The Lost Trail.\n\nThe scripted Marvels series is meant to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the comics series, and it will largely follow the same story, seeing Sheldon (and other ordinary, non-superpowered people) deal with the aftermath of an attempted invasion by the world-devouring Galactus and his battle with the Fantastic Four.\n\nJust in time for the 25th anniversary of the original comics\n\nAccording to the announcement, the Marvels podcast will see these ordinary people \u201cembark on an investigation to confirm or debunk one of the most super-powered conspiracy theories of all time.\u201d It sounds like the show will be offering a more grounded, personal take on the superhero genre, much like the two Wolverine series, which looked to emulate modern podcasts like S-Town and Serial.\n\nMuch like the Wolverine shows, which starred The Hobbit\u2019s Richard Armitage, Marvels will also feature a star-studded cast, with Cliff \u201cMethod Man\u201d Smith as Ben Urich, AnnaSophia Robb as Marcia Hardesty, Ethan Peck as Mr. Fantastic, and Seth Barrish as Phil Sheldon. The podcast will launch this fall, and it will be exclusively available on Stitcher Premium until 2020.", "description": "Marvel and Stitcher have announced their next superhero podcast partnership: a radio drama adaptation of Kurt Busiek and Alex Ross\u2019 limited Marvels series, which sees news photographer Phil Sheldon trying to get by in the chaos of a superhero world.
