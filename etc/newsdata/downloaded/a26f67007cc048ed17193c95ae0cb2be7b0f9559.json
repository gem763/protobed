But he was so eager to meet the 14-year-old, federal prosecutors say, that he began walking to meet her, setting out on a 351-mile odyssey that took him through three states along the Great Lakes.\n\nOn Thursday, four days after he set out on his trek, he made it to his destination \u2014 Winnebago County, Wis. \u2014 and was promptly arrested. The teen girl who Jenkins thought he had been corresponding with was actually an undercover cop.\n\nAccording to the Oshkosh Northwestern, Jenkins had previously caught the eye of local law enforcement. In 2011, while living in Oshkosh, Wis., he was charged with two counts of repeated first-degree sexual assault after two boys, ages 7 and 8, told police that Jenkins had touched them inappropriately and threatened that they would get in trouble if they told anyone.\n\nJenkins reportedly denied the allegations, telling investigators that the boys were \u201cmaking the whole thing up,\u201d but he later pleaded no contest to four counts of child abuse, a reduced charge. He was sentenced to four years of probation and his 360-day jail sentence was stayed, the paper reported.\n\nAccording to a police affidavit, Jenkins moved to Whitestown, Ind., after the incident, but he soon came into the crosshairs of law enforcement once again. Earlier this month, a deputy with the Winnebago County Sheriff\u2019s Office, who was working with the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, created a fake Facebook profile, posing as a 14-year-old girl from Neenah, Wis., named \u201cKylee Marie.\u201d The deputy, who recognized Jenkins from his stint in the Winnebago County Jail, sent the 32-year-old a friend request. Jenkins accepted.\n\nThe two struck up a conversation. Court records filed in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Eastern District of Wisconsin show that \u201cKylee\u201d was candid about her supposed age, asking Jenkins, \u201cdo u care im 14 and drink?\u201d The 32-year-old replied that he didn\u2019t. When the undercover deputy brought up the issue again, typing \u201ci dont drive tho im only 14 lol,\u201d Jenkins allegedly responded, \u201cYa. At your age I was 15 when I got the first DUI,\u201d before asking for a photo of \u201cKylee.\u201d\n\nAuthorities say that Jenkins soon began expressing interest in meeting the supposed 14-year-old, telling her, \u201cif i had the money i would put u on a bus.\u201d He allegedly told \u201cKylee\u201d that they could get a house together, and she would be able to drink and party as much as she wanted. She should tell her parents that she was going to spend the next two to three weeks helping out a friend\u2019s parents, he suggested, and would call everyday.\n\n\u201cU would be my kid for ever,\u201d Jenkins wrote, according to the police affidavit. \u201cI have people that would take care of it with the paperwork.\u201d\n\nThe conversation quickly turned sexually explicit, with the 32-year-old requesting nude photographs, police wrote. On Oct. 6, he allegedly asked \u201cKylee\u201d if she would like him to come up to Wisconsin and get her. Not long after the undercover cop playing the part of a teenager agreed, Jenkins said that he had started walking. He predicted it would take him two to four days to get to her: 108 hours if he walked, 30 hours if he biked.\n\nHe decided to walk, police say. The arduous trek would have taken him through the farm country surrounding Indianapolis to the industrial southern shore of Lake Michigan, then through Chicago. Along the way, authorities say, he updated \u201cKylee\u201d on his progress, sending pictures of exit signs and local landmarks such as churches that he passed along the way, and selfies taken during his walk.\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear how many of the 300-plus miles Jenkins actually covered on foot. According to court documents, he messaged \u201cKylee\u201d on Thursday, four days after he had started walking, and said that he was in Wisconsin. Someone had bought him a bus ticket that got him to Milwaukee, he explained, before telling \u201cKylee\u201d that he wanted to have 500 kids with her, including one in the next year. When Jenkins arrived in Winnebago County later that same day, an FBI agent and local authorities arrested him.\n\n\u201cOur nation faces an epidemic of child sexual abuse, with the Internet making it too easy for predators to communicate with children across the country,\u201d U.S. Attorney Matthew D. Krueger said in a Friday statement.\n\nJenkins faces charges of using a computer to attempt to persuade, induce or entice a minor to engage in unlawful sexual activity, which comes with a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years and the potential for life in prison. Court records show that he has been assigned a federal public defender, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Sunday night.", "description": "Tommy Lee Jenkins, 32, was arrested as soon as he arrived in Winnebago County, Wis.", "authors": ["Antonia Noori Farzan", "Reporter For The Morning Mix", "October At Am", "Antonia Noori Farzan Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
