Pound Rally Fizzles as Ireland Puts Dampener on Brexit Hopes\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The pulled back from a two-month high as Ireland warned a Brexit deal is not close, calming a rally sparked by optimism from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\nThe currency halted two weeks of gains after Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the \u201cmood music\u201d has improved yet there is still \u201cquite a wide gap\u201d between the U.K. and European Union. Sterling had been closing in on its longest run of weekly increases since January after Sky News reported Thursday that Juncker thinks a deal can be reached by the Oct. 31 deadline.\n\nPound traders are hanging on every word from both sides as they try to ascertain if an economically damaging crash-out scenario can be averted. Negotiations around Brexit have been stuck for months with little sign of movement as the October deadline looms for the U.K. to leave the EU.\n\n\u201cThe pound could have more to gain on the upside over the short-term,\u201d said Derek Halpenny, the head of markets research at MUFG, adding the bank remained skeptical until it hears supportive comments from Brussels on any U.K. proposals. \u201cWe certainly have to acknowledge there might be something in this but equally this could so easily be much ado about nothing.\u201d\n\nThe pound was down 0.2% at $1.2501 by 13:12 p.m. in London, after touching the highest since July 15. It\u2019s the best performer among peers this month, with a 2.9% rally.\n\nThe positive noise around efforts to forge a deal for now is just rhetoric that can be interpreted either way. Juncker himself said Wednesday that a risk of a no-deal Brexit was \u201cpalpable.\u201d\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s \u201creally unclear as to where things actually stand,\u201d said Brendan McKenna, a foreign-exchange strategist at Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) Securities in New York.\n\nSterling could rise 5% if a deal is clinched, or tumble to parity with both the dollar and the euro if the U.K. crashes out of the bloc, according to Shamik Dhar, chief economist at BNY Mellon Investment Management.", "description": "Pound Rally Fizzles as Ireland Puts Dampener on Brexit Hopes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED5S049_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
