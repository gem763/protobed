She quickly became an advocate and activist for those living with a terminal illness. She died in 2018.\n\n\"Finding your purpose is not some grandiose moment,\" Wineland says in the documentary. \"It's slowly realizing that you have potential as a human being, and that there's absolutely nothing that can stand in the way of that.\"\n\nThe new film was directed and produced by the Academy Award-winning documentarian Nicholas Reed (who has produced films like \"The Lady in Number 6: Music Saved My Life\"), and was released on September 2, one year after Wineland died at 21 years old from a stroke following a double lung transplant. To make the film, Reed and his collaborators followed Wineland for more than a year before she died.\n\nClaire Wineland at the Dream Foundation's 2017 Dreamland Gala.

She shared her inspirational message in a 2017 TEDx Talk, called \"Don't wait to be healed to start serving humanity,\" and among several other recognitions, she was named one of Seventeen Magazine's \"17 Power Teens\" in 2016.\n\nReed hopes Wineland's message will reach people who need it.\n\n\"The goal is to reach 1 billion views and get the message to as many people around the world,\" Reed told Business Insider about the project. The film can be found on Wineland's YouTube Channel, Claire Wineland, and does not have advertising running on it.\n\nWineland had the ability to bring people together and make them feel less alone, Reed said. Filming Wineland go through four hours of treatment every day, and then wake up and do four hours of treatment again, amazed the filmmakers, they said. She formed the direction of the project, which they began working on with Wineland and finished after she died.\n\n\"She had her hand in so many parts of the project, and still does,\" Azevedo said. \"Intentionally, we just let her go, not taking away from her message. And that has more magic than any cinematic techniques.\"\n\nWatch the documentary on Wineland's YouTube Channel.", "description": "YouTube depicts the life of the late vlogger, Claire Wineland, with a new YouTube Originals documentary, \"Claire.\"", "authors": ["Amanda Perelli"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6eadf32e22af0a2e390572-1536-768.jpg"}
