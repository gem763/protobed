Wake up!:' Nationals react to umpires in Game 5", "language": "en", "text": "Victor Robles tossed his gear in disgust. The Nationals outfielder couldn\u2019t believe umpire Lance Barksdale had ruled Gerrit Cole\u2019s fastball a strike, thus ending the at-bat and the seventh inning. He threw his helmet, yelled and then hurled his batting gloves toward the plate, as well.\n\nThe reaction spotlighted what turned out to be a controversial night for the umpires. Replays showed Cole\u2019s pitch off the plate, and it wasn\u2019t the only call that was off the mark.\n\nBut standing at his locker inside the clubhouse, his anger subsided, Robles downplayed the impact the vall had in Washington\u2019s 7-1 loss Sunday in Game 5 against the Houston Astros. Down 3-2, the Nationals are now on the brink of elimination and have bigger problems to worry about as the series shifts back to Houston.\n\n\u201cIt was a very important at-bat and I\u2019ve always said we\u2019re all human, we all make mistakes,\u201d Robles said through a translator. \u201cI feel like he might have made a mistake on that pitch, but that\u2019s part of being human, human nature.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals have plenty to point to as to what went wrong, why they\u2019ve now lost three straight after taking a 2-0 lead in Houston. Their starting pitching hasn\u2019t been quite as strong, and that was again the case when Joe Ross made an emergency start after Max Scherzer was scratched with a neck injury. Their bats have gone quiet, registering just four hits in Game 5.\n\nBut Barksdale\u2019s outing will still draw plenty of criticism nationally \u2014 especially since there\u2019s a strong push from fans and experts to replace umpires with \u201crobot umps,\u201d or let technology call balls and strikes.\n\nRob Friedman, who runs the popular Twitter account \u201cPitching Ninja,\u201d tweeted a video out to his nearly 180,000 followers highlighting two botched calls from Barksdale. One showed a Tanner Rainey pitch that seemed to paint the corner, only to be called a ball. And the other showed Cole\u2019s high-and-away fastball that was called a strike.\n\nFriedman included four \u201crobot\u201d emoji in the caption, making his thoughts clear on the matter.\n\nThe Nationals, too, were upset in the course of the game. On Rainey\u2019s pitch, mics picked up catcher Yan Gomes saying, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s my fault?\u2019 when discussing the call with Barksdale.\n\nManager Dave Martinez then shouted: \u201cCome on, Lance! It\u2019s the World Series! Wake up!\u201d\n\nUmp doesn\u2019t call strike three. Tells Gomes he was taking off on him. Gomes replies \u2018Oh it\u2019s my fault?\u201d\n\n\n\nThen Martinez kindly asks the ump to wake up because its the World Series. pic.twitter.com/iRUr349bQh \u2014 Jomboy (@Jomboy_) October 28, 2019\n\nAt his locker, Gomes said he wasn\u2019t going to talk about the calls.\n\nThen, he continued.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep saying, the fact you\u2019re asking about him,\u201d Gomes said. \u201cYou\u2019re answering your own questions.\u201d\n\nIn his post-game press conference, Martinez also avoided the subject. He said he wasn\u2019t going to criticize, telling reporters umpires have a \u201ctough job, and they try to do the best they can.\u201d\n\nReliever Sean Doolittle, though, said the Nationals can\u2019t use the calls as an excuse \u2014 adding he didn\u2019t think anyone was doing that.\n\nRyan Zimmerman echoed the same.\n\n\u201cLance did not lose us the game tonight, the first baseman said. \u201cGerrit Cole beat us. I think that\u2019s the best way to put it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
