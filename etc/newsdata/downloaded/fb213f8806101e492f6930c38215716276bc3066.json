He touched a splintered beam of wood and pointed to the fallen trees, overcome by memories.\n\n\"We planted those trees ourselves. Everything has a memory, you know,\" he said. \"It's so, so sad. ... In the Bible there is a person called Job, and I feel like Job right now. He's lost everything, but his faith kept him strong.\"\n\nThe devastation wrought by Dorian \u2014 and the terror it inflicted during its day-and-a-half mauling of the Bahamas \u2014 came into focus Wednesday as the passing of the storm revealed a muddy, debris-strewn landscape of smashed and flooded-out homes on Abaco and Grand Bahama islands. The official death toll from the strongest hurricane on record ever to hit the country jumped to 20, and there was little doubt it would climb higher.\n\nWith a now-distant Dorian pushing its way up the Southeastern U.S. coast, menacing Georgia and the Carolinas, many people living in the Bahamas were in shock as they slowly came out of shelters and checked on their homes.\n\nIn one community, George Bolter stood in the bright sunshine and surveyed the ruins of what was once his home. He picked at the debris, trying to find something, anything, salvageable. A couple of walls were the only thing left.\n\n\"I have lost everything,\" he said. \"I have lost all my baby's clothes, my son's clothes. We have nowhere to stay, nowhere to live. Everything is gone.\"\n\nThe Bahamian government sent hundreds of police officers and marines into the stricken islands, along with doctors, nurses and other health care workers, in an effort to reach drenched and stunned victims and take the full measure of the disaster.\n\n\"There are many in Grand Bahama who are suffering,\" Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said at a news conference. \"We know there are many Bahamians that are in need of help. I want to assure you that more help is on the way.\"\n\nHe thanked the international community for its response, especially the U.S. government for what he called their \"exceptional assistance.\"\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard, Britain's Royal Navy and relief organizations including the United Nations and the Red Cross joined the burgeoning effort to rush food and medicine to survivors and lift the most desperate people to safety by helicopter. The U.S. government also dispatched urban search-and-rescue teams.\n\nLonda Sawyer stepped off a helicopter in Nassau, the capital, with her two children and two dogs after being rescued from Marsh Harbor in the Abaco islands.\n\n\"I'm just thankful I'm alive,\" she said. \"The Lord saved me.\"\n\nSawyer said that her home was completely flooded and that she and her family fled to a friend's home, where the water came up to the second floor and carried them up to within a few feet of the roof. She said she and her children and the dogs were floating on a mattress for about half an hour until the water began receding.\n\nSandra Cooke, who lives in Nassau, said her sister-in-law was trapped under her roof for 17 hours in the Abaco islands and wrapped herself in a shower curtain as she waited.\n\n\"The dog laid on top of her to keep her warm until the neighbors could come to help,\" she said. \"All of my family lives in Marsh Harbor, and everybody lost everything. Not one of them have a home to live anymore.\"\n\nThe storm pounded the Bahamas with Category 5 winds up to 185 mph (295 kph) and torrential rains, swamping neighborhoods in brown floodwaters and destroying or severely damaging, by one estimate, nearly half the homes in Abaco and Grand Bahama, which have 70,000 residents and are known for their marinas, golf courses and all-inclusive resorts.\n\nBahamian Health Minister Duane Sands said 17 of the dead were from the Abaco islands and three from Grand Bahama. He said he could not release further details because the government still had to contact family members.\n\nSome people in the Abaco islands complained that they had not seen any aid except for medical supplies for the main hospital, where hundreds of people were temporarily living as they awaited help.\n\nBy late Wednesday, Dorian has crept back up to Category 3 force with 115 mph (185 kph) winds and was pushing toward a brush with the Carolinas \u2014 with a direct hit on the outer banks possible. An estimated 3 million people in Florida, Georgia and North and South Carolina had been warned to clear out, and highways leading inland were turned into one-way evacuation routes.", "description": "The ground crunched under Greg Alem's feet on Wednesday as he walked over the ruins of his home, laid waste by Hurricane Dorian.
