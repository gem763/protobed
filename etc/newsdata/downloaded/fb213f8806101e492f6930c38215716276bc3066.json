(Curtis Compton/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP)\n\nFREEPORT, Bahamas (AP) \u2014 Bahamians rescued victims of Hurricane Dorian with jet skis and a bulldozer as the U.S. Coast Guard, Britain's Royal Navy and a handful of aid groups tried to get food and medicine to survivors and take the most desperate people to safety.\n\nAirports were flooded and roads impassable after the most powerful storm to hit the Bahamas in recorded history parked over Abaco and Grand Bahama islands, pounding them with winds up to 185 mph (295 kph) and torrential rain before finally moving into open waters Tuesday on a course toward Florida.\n\nPeople on the U.S. coast made final preparations for a storm with winds at a still-dangerous 110 mph (175 kph), making it a Category 2 storm.\n\nAt least seven deaths were reported in the Bahamas, with the full scope of the disaster still unknown.\n\nThe storm's punishing winds and muddy brown floodwaters destroyed or severely damaged thousands of homes, crippled hospitals and trapped people in attics.\n\n\"It's total devastation. It's decimated. Apocalyptic,\" said Lia Head-Rigby, who helps run a local hurricane relief group and flew over the Bahamas' hard-hit Abaco Islands. \"It's not rebuilding something that was there; we have to start again.\"\n\nShe said her representative on Abaco told her there were \"a lot more dead,\" though she had no numbers as bodies being gathered.\n\nThe Bahamas' prime minister also expected more deaths and predicted that rebuilding would require \"a massive, coordinated effort.\"\n\n\"We are in the midst of one of the greatest national crises in our country's history,\" Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said at a news conference. \"No effort or resources will be held back.\"\n\nFive Coast Guard helicopters ran near-hourly flights to the stricken Abaco, flying more than 20 injured people to the capital's main hospital. British sailors were also rushing in aid. A few private aid groups also tried to reach the battered islands in the northern Bahamas.\n\n\"We don't want people thinking we've forgotten them. ... We know what your conditions are,\" Tammy Mitchell of the Bahamas' National Emergency Management Agency told ZNS Bahamas radio station.\n\nWith their heads bowed against heavy wind and rain, rescuers began evacuating people from the storm's aftermath across Grand Bahama island late Tuesday, using jet skis, boats and even a huge bulldozer that cradled children and adults in its digger as it churned through deep waters and carried them to safety.\n\nOne rescuer gently scooped up an elderly man in his arms and walked toward a pickup truck waiting to evacuate him and others to higher ground.\n\nOver 2 million people along the coast in Florida, Georgia and North and South Carolina were warned to evacuate. While the threat of a direct hit on Florida had all but evaporated, Dorian was expected to pass dangerously close to Georgia and South Carolina \u2014 and perhaps strike North Carolina \u2014 on Thursday or Friday. The hurricane's eye passed to the east of Cape Canaveral, Florida, early Wednesday.\n\nEven if landfall does not occur, the system is likely to cause storm surge and severe flooding, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.\n\n\"Don't tough it out. Get out,\" said U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency official Carlos Castillo.\n\nIn the Bahamas, Red Cross spokesman Matthew Cochrane said more than 13,000 houses, or about 45% of the homes on Grand Bahama and Abaco, were believed to be severely damaged or destroyed. U.N. officials said more than 60,000 people on the hard-hit islands will need food, and the Red Cross said some 62,000 will need clean drinking water.\n\n\"What we are hearing lends credence to the fact that this has been a catastrophic storm and a catastrophic impact,\" Cochrane said.\n\nLawson Bates, a staffer for Arkansas-based MedicCorps, flew over Abaco and said: \"It looks completely flattened. There's boats way inland that are flipped over. It's total devastation.\"\n\nThe Red Cross authorized $500,000 for the first wave of disaster relief, Cochrane said. U.N. humanitarian teams stood ready to go into the stricken areas to help assess damage and the country's needs, U.N. spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric said. The U.S. government also sent a disaster response team.\n\nAbaco and Grand Bahama islands, with a combined population of about 70,000, are known for their marinas, golf courses and all-inclusive resorts. To the south, the Bahamas' most populous island, New Providence, which includes the capital city of Nassau and has over a quarter-million people, had little damage.", "description": "Bahamians rescued victims of Hurricane Dorian with jet skis and a bulldozer as the U.S. Coast Guard, Britain's Royal Navy and a handful of aid groups tried to get food and medicine to survivors and take the most desperate people to safety.
