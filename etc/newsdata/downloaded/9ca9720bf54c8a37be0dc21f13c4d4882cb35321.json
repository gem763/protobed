Special Envoy Geir Pedersen talks to reporters after a meeting with Chinese Special Envoy Xie Xiaoyan at the United nations in Geneva, Switzerland August 20, 2019. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo\n\nThe U.N. announced on Monday the formation of a constitutional committee for Syria, a long-awaited step in a stalled peace process.\n\nU.N. officials say such a committee is key to political reforms and new elections meant to unify Syria and end a war that has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced about half of the pre-war 22 million population.\n\n\u201cAfter eight and a half years of war and conflict we actually have some positive news,\u201d envoy Geir Pedersen told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.\n\n\u201cThis is a deeply divided society, there is a lack of trust, obviously between the two parties, but there is also a lack of trust between Syria and the international community,\u201d Pedersen said. \u201cSo hopefully the constitutional committee can be a first step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nAccording to a letter sent to the Security Council from U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, dated Thursday, and seen by Reuters, the committee will meet under U.N. auspices in Geneva on Oct. 30.\n\nA congress convened by Russia, a leading ally of President Bashir al-Assad, asked the United Nations to form a committee to draft a new constitution after many rounds of talks to end the war had failed.\n\nThe body will compromise 150 people, split three ways between the government, opposition and civil society with each side selecting 15 people to prepare and draft constitutional proposals.\n\n\u201cOne important confidence building measure ... the release of abductees and detainees ... in my opinion it hasn\u2019t been at the scale we really need to send a proper message,\u201d Pedersen said.\n\n\u201cIf we do this at scale ... together with the constitutional committee and other aspects of changes on the ground in Syria, it will send an important message that a new beginning for Syria is possible.\u201d\n\nSuccessive U.N. envoys have failed to stop Syria\u2019s civil war. Pedersen, the fourth man in the job, has started with the constitutional committee, a modest effort compared with former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan\u2019s attempt to reach a peace agreement at an international conference in 2012.\n\nPedersen acknowledged that there will be \u201ca lot of cynicism.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuestions will be asked why is it different this time? Why will this not just be another round of futile discussions in Geneva? But ... this is the first time that we actually have an agreement between the two parties,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the first one to admit this will not be easy,\u201d he said.\n\n(This story has been refiled to delete extraneous word \u201cthe\u201d in first paragraph.)", "description": "The Syrian government and opposition should move forward on large-scale prisoner exchanges to build confidence ahead of their first talks next month in more than a year, the United Nations special envoy for Syria said on Friday.", "authors": ["John Irish", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434612204&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q1GH", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
