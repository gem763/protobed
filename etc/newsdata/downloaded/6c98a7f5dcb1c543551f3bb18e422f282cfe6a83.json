Two Ukrainian gas industry experts say the gas-market reforms pushed by Biden and others in 2014 and 2015 hit Firtash in the wallet, and badly. One knowledgeable outside observer estimated that the 2014 and 2015 gas reforms and legislation cost him hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nOn Dec. 9, 2015, Biden gave a speech to Ukraine\u2019s parliament. He praised the protesters who forced out Ukraine\u2019s Russia-friendly president, he recited Ukrainian poetry, and he called for reforms to Ukraine\u2019s gas market, too.\n\n\u201cThe energy sector needs to be competitive, ruled by market principles\u2014not sweetheart deals,\u201d he said, basking in the audience\u2019s repeated applause.\n\nFirtash, who built his fortune in part through a rather sweet gas-trading deal, hated it. Earlier this year\u2014more than three and a half years after the talk\u2014he was still seething. Firtash told The Daily Beast that the Ukrainian parliamentarians in the audience were humiliatingly subservient to Biden.\n\n\u201cHe was the overlord,\u201d Firtash said. \u201cI was ashamed to look at this. I was repulsed.\u201d\n\nNow people linked to Firtash are at the heart of Republicans\u2019 efforts to find dirt on Biden, and a document Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has said is key to his theory of Biden World malfeasance was produced for Firtash\u2019s legal team. The reporter who published that document, The Hill\u2019s John Solomon, is a client of Firtash\u2019s new lawyers, Victoria Toensing and Joe DiGenova. Over the summer, Trump pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to cooperate with Giuliani\u2019s efforts. That pressure stunned many Republicans and gave House Democratic leadership the impetus they had long sought to announce an impeachment inquiry.\n\nAnd two Giuliani associates reportedly brought up Firtash\u2019s name when talking about their plans for Ukraine\u2019s energy sector. Those two associates also worked with Giuliani to find dirt on Biden, and they\u2019ve both been charged with financial crimes. On top of that, Firtash\u2019s lawyers say one of them, Lev Parnas, has worked as a translator for his legal team.\n\nFirtash\u2019s blunt assessment of Biden\u2019s speech at the parliament and influence on Ukraine\u2014shared earlier this year with The Daily Beast and published here in full for the first time\u2014highlights how a battle over the future of Ukraine bled into the highest levels of American politics.\n\nFirtash\u2019s company did not respond to requests for comment. Biden\u2019s campaign called Firtash \u201ca Kremlin-friendly Ukrainian oligarch who\u2019s been wanted on bribery and racketeering charges in the U.S. since 2014.\u201d\n\nGas Man\n\nFirtash was born in Ukraine and\u2014like many other up-and-coming oligarchs\u2014grew rich in the rubble of the Soviet Union. After spending some time in Moscow, he started trading gas from Central Asia to Ukraine. His renown as a gas trader grew, and he made deals with Russia\u2019s state-owned giant Gazprom to move Russia\u2019s abundant gas to energy-hungry Ukraine.\n\nWith Gazprom\u2019s blessing, he got deals widely characterized as of the sweetheart variety: Firtash bought cheap gas from Russia, sold it for a lot more in Ukraine, and profited. He then bankrolled Russia-friendly politicians in Ukraine. One such politician was Viktor Yanukovych, who hired Paul Manafort. American diplomats at the time saw Firtash as a vector of Russian influence\u2014part of the connective tissue between the Kremlin and Kyiv.\n\nAnd American law enforcement saw him as a crook. On April 2, 2014, the Justice Department announced that he had been indicted for authorizing $18.5 million in bribes to Indian government officials. The case involved efforts to mine for titanium that would be used in Boeing planes.\n\nAustrian authorities arrested Firtash a few weeks before the DOJ\u2019s announcement. He posted about $174 million in bail and has since been living in Vienna, fighting extradition from his palatial corporate offices there. And while the allegation isn\u2019t part of the DOJ\u2019s indictment of Firtash, U.S. government lawyers have said in court that he\u2019s an \u201cupper echelon\u201d associate of a Russian criminal organization. Firtash says the claim is baseless.", "description": "Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast/Photos GettyIndicted Ukrainian gas oligarch Dmytro Firtash spent more than $1 million hiring key figures in Republican efforts to investigate the Biden family.\u00a0His lawyers\u2014who often go on Fox News to defend President Trump\u2014say they needed the dirt on", "authors": ["Betsy Swan", "Adam Rawnsley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.gNzRNV_9ObI3Di1ebkuDw--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/6c12b6075ddbf35cb1bf036ad7c37555", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
