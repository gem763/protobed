William stopped his weekly visits to the family home and his parents did not call him on his birthday in October.\n\n\u201cMy father said that if William doesn\u2019t take the initiative to talk to him, he doesn\u2019t want to see him\u2026My mother is normally the mediator, but even she doesn\u2019t have a solution,\u201d said Brian.\n\nThe summer of huge, sometimes violent, pro-democracy protests in the semi-autonomous Chinese city have been cross-generational but are overwhelming led by the young. Academic research has shown that half of those at rallies are between 20 and 30 years old, reported the Hong Kong Free Press.\n\nAn anti-government protester throws a Molotov cocktail in Hong Kong Credit: Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters More", "description": "The Wongs had always been a close-knit family.
