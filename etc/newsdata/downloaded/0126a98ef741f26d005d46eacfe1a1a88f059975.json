A whistleblower complaint by a CIA officer alleges the president solicited foreign interference in the 2020 elections by pressing Ukraine\u2019s president in a July 25 call to pursue investigations, including into the activities of Biden, a Democrat who is running for president.\n\nThe complaint cites Yovanovitch\u2019s ouster as one of a series of events that paved the way for what the whistleblower alleges was an abuse of power by the president. Trump has described the call with his Ukrainian counterpart as \u201cperfect\u201d and the House inquiry as a \u201choax.\u201d\n\nState Department officials were told this spring that Yovanovitch\u2019s removal was a priority for the president, a person familiar with the matter said. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo supported the move, an administration official said. Yovanovitch was told by State Department officials that they couldn\u2019t shield her from attacks by the president and his allies, according to people close to her.\n\nIn an interview, Giuliani told The Wall Street Journal that in the lead-up to Yovanovitch\u2019s removal, he reminded the president of complaints percolating among Trump supporters that she had displayed an anti-Trump bias in private conversations. In Giuliani\u2019s view, she also had been an obstacle to efforts to push Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\n\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\n\nThe seven-year auto loan: America\u2019s middle class can\u2019t afford its cars.\n\n\u2018Active interest\u2019: Insurance tycoon spied on women who caught his eye.", "description": "President Donald Trump ordered the removal of the ambassador to Ukraine after months of complaints from allies outside the administration, including his...", "authors": ["Rebecca Ballhaus", "Michael C.
