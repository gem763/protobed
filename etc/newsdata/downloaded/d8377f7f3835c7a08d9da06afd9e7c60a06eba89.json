Kamala Harris speaks at a townhall on LGBTQ issues in Los Angeles, Calif., October 10, 2019. (Mike Blake/Reuters)\n\nSenator Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) accused her fellow Democratic presidential candidates and debate moderators of failing to adequately prioritize the discussion of abortion rights during Tuesday evening\u2019s debate.\n\n\u201cThis is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word, with all of these discussions about health care, on women\u2019s access to reproductive healthcare, which is under full-on attack,\u201d Harris said from the CNN debate state in Ohio.\n\n\u201cPeople need to keep their hands off of women\u2019s bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives,\u201d she added.\n\nOver the last year, several states have passed what the Harris campaign has called \u201cdangerous and deadly laws\u201d abortion bans, including so-called \u201cheartbeat bills,\u201d which would ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, around four weeks of pregnancy.\n\nSuch bills are designed to spark court challenges that could potentially trigger a relitigation of Roe vs. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court case that legalized abortion nationwide. Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Alabama and Ohio have all passed strict abortion bans.\n\nHarris has also pledged to require states and localities with a history of restrictive abortion regimes to obtain approval from the Justice Department before enacting laws further restricting the procedure. Under her plan, the DOJ would determine if a restriction was consistent with Roe vs. Wade before it could take effect.\n\nThe former California attorney general has also promised to fight to protect Planned Parenthood from Republican attempts to defund the mammoth abortion provider, nominate judges who respect Roe, and work to repeal the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the direct federal funding of abortions.", "description": "Senator Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) accused her fellow Democratic presidential candidates and debate moderators of failing to adequately prioritize the discussion of abortion rights during Tuesday evening's debate.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Kevin D.
