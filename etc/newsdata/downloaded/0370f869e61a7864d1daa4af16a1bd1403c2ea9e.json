The biggest obstacle to the restoration of power-sharing is an Irish-language act.\n\nColum Eastwood, the leader of the moderate nationalist SDLP, said there was negligible progress despite urgency over Brexit and atrophying public services. \u201cThe cold truth is that we are no closer to Irish-language legislation now than we were three years ago. We are facing a national emergency on this island as a no-deal Brexit draws nearer.\u201d\n\nThe murder of the journalist Lyra McKee in April by dissident republicans galvanised British and Irish officials to shepherd parties into talks at Stormont, with all sides expressing concern at armed groups filling the political void.\n\nTalks stalled amid mistrust between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in. Not even the imminent decriminalisation of abortion on 22 October \u2013 unless the assembly reconvenes before that date \u2013 persuaded the anti-abortion DUP to return.\n\nNaomi Long, the leader of the Alliance party, called the political stalemate \u201cshameful\u201d. A campaign group, We Deserve Better, is due to hold a protest outside Stormont on Sunday.\n\nThe gloom in Belfast contrasted with hope in Brussels after British and EU negotiators got the green light to enter a \u201ctunnel\u201d of intense talks to try to hammer out a Brexit deal.\n\nThere have been two key sticking points: Downing Street\u2019s insistence on a customs border on the island of Ireland; and a mechanism for gaining democratic consent for Northern Ireland\u2019s alignment with the EU\u2019s single market . The latter had raised anxiety in some quarters over a DUP veto on trading arrangements.\n\nThursday\u2019s meeting between Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, ended with both sides declaring a \u201cpathway\u201d to a possible Brexit deal, suggesting compromise on both issues.\n\nAfter speaking to Johnson later on Thursday Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, told the BBC there would not be a situation where \u201cone community has a veto\u201d over Brexit plans.\n\nHe said there was \u201ca range of options\u201d for finding consent. He did not rule out a Northern Ireland-only referendum. \u201cThe key thing is we have to have regard to the Good Friday agreement and have regard to the need to have a cross-community approach to how we resolve this.\u201d\n\nThe absence of a DUP veto would alarm the party\u2019s leaders \u2013 Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds \u2013 as well as its grassroots.\n\nEven more problematic would be any fudging on customs that could be interpreted as creating a border along the Irish Sea, a \u201cblood red line\u201d for a party dedicated to protecting Northern Ireland\u2019s status in the UK.\n\nRival unionists pounced on that possibility. Jim Allister, the leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice party, said: \u201cIf the proposals we\u2019re beginning to hear about are correct it would totally disintegrate that economic unity \u2026 No matter how you dress it up, that is a fundamental assault upon our position within the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nJim Nicholson, a UUP former MEP, said the region could be left on the \u201cwindow ledge\u201d of the union. \u201cI fear that Northern Ireland is being offered up by Boris Johnson as the sacrificial lamb to save Brexit for the rest of the UK, the ERG and especially English nationalists.\u201d\n\nThere was no immediate response from DUP leaders. The party\u2019s 10 Westminster MPs and influence over some hardline Tory Brexiters could make or break any deal that emerges from Brussels.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s business community has repeatedly warned of ruin if the UK leaves without a deal. Two-thirds of the region\u2019s small- and medium-sized enterprises with investment plans have either cancelled or postponed them owing to the uncertainty, according to the latest AIB Brexit Sentiment Index, a quarterly survey. Its Northern Ireland index has reached -41, an all-time low.", "description": "Leaders voice scepticism about ending 998-day impasse, leaving obstacle to Brexit deal", "authors": ["Rory Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f5f5544599078b13c426649b4ebeb467bc10556/0_156_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=99a34a3f6c70100a53889e66d16015f8", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
