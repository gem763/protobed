This retirement savings contributions credit can be claimed in addition to any tax deduction you earn by contributing to a traditional retirement account.\n\nHere's how to qualify for the saver's credit on your 2019 tax return:\n\n-- Check the saver's credit income requirements.\n\n-- Save in a qualifying retirement account, such as a 401(k) or IRA.\n\n-- Contribute enough for the full credit.\n\n-- Meet the saver's credit contribution deadline.\n\nFind out if you are eligible for the saver's credit and what you need to do to claim the saver's credit in 2019.\n\nCheck the Saver's Credit Income Requirements\n\nIndividuals with an adjusted gross income of up to $32,000 in 2019 could qualify for the saver's credit if they contribute to a retirement account. \"If you're single and earning $20,000, people in that income level have a hard time saving for retirement,\" says Gil Charney, director of The Tax Institute at H&R Block. \"It's difficult pragmatically to be able to make these kinds of savings decisions, but if you can, it is a very good deal.\" Heads of household have a higher saver's credit income threshold of $48,000 in 2019. Married couples can earn as much as $64,000 in 2019 and remain eligible for the saver's credit.\n\n[See: How Much Should You Contribute to a 401(k)?]\n\nContribute to a Saver's Credit Qualifying Retirement Account\n\nThere are several types of retirement accounts that might qualify you for the saver's credit. Contributing to a 401(k) plan will often allow you to claim the saver's credit. Other types of eligible workplace retirement accounts include 403(b) plans for employees of public schools, 457 plans for state or local government employees, SEP or SIMPLE plans, which are sometimes used by smaller employers, and the federal government's Thrift Savings Plan. But you don't necessarily need a workplace retirement account to qualify for the credit. Contributions to a traditional IRA, Roth IRA or ABLE account of which you are the designated beneficiary could also make you eligible for the saver's credit.\n\nSave Enough to Qualify for the Full Saver's Credit\n\nThe saver's credit can be claimed on retirement account contributions of up to $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for couples. However, distributions from your retirement account might reduce the amount that is used to calculate the credit.\n\nMeet the Saver's Credit Contribution Deadline\n\nContributions to 401(k) plans and similar types of workplace retirement accounts that might qualify for the saver's credit are typically due by the end of the calendar year. However, you have until the due date of your tax return in April to make an IRA contribution that counts toward the saver's credit. So retirement savers have until April 15, 2020, to make a traditional IRA or Roth IRA contribution that makes them eligible for the saver's credit on their 2019 tax return.\n\n[Read: New 401(k) and IRA Limits for 2019.]\n\nDon't Expect a Large Saver's Credit\n\nThe saver's credit could reduce the income tax you owe or boost your refund. \"The saver's credit is better than a deduction,\" says Mark Steber, chief tax officer for Jackson Hewitt Tax Service. \"It's reduced tax liability or money back on your tax return.\" The maximum possible credit is $1,000 for an individual or $2,000 for a married couple. However, most people receive smaller credits.\n\nAccording to a statement from the IRS, \"It is often much less and, due in part to the impact of other deductions and credits, may, in fact, be zero for some taxpayers.\"\n\nThe saver's credit was claimed on 8.1 million income tax returns in 2015, and the government paid out nearly $1.4 billion for this retirement savings incentive, according to IRS data. However, most workers don't know about the tax savings they could be eligible for by claiming the saver's credit. Some 38% of workers say they are aware of the saver's credit, but that's up from a quarter in 2012, according to a 2018 Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies online survey of 5,923 workers at for-profit companies. Millennials (42%) are more likely to know about the saver's credit than members of Generation X (33%) or baby boomers (34%), the survey found.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Low- and moderate-income workers who save for retirement in a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account could qualify for the saver's credit.
