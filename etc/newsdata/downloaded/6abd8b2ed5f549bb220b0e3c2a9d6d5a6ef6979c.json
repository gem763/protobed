He closed his own car door, which is against royal protocol as I\u2019m sure you know. A nightmare situation. Though I haven\u2019t spoken to him, I\u2019m quite sure he is aware that this is a \u201cforgive but never forget\u201d sort of thing, and while I wish him peace, I know that we will never find it ourselves. Alas. He seems to be attempting to get back in our good graces by releasing an admittedly tantalizing bit of information regarding his (and Meghan Markle\u2019s) baby, the young Prince Archie. Please, Harry \u2014 do tell.\n\nPrince Archie, as I\u2019m sure you know, was potentially named after a cat who got fat by eating too many grapes. Whether or not that tail (cat tail) is based in fact, it seems Archie has at least one thing in common with his potential namesake: the ability to gain mass.\n\nWhile Prince Harry was visiting a high school in Luton (in England) this week, a student reportedly asked him, \u201cHow is everything with Archie?\u201d A simple question \u2014 or is it?\n\n\u201cHe is really well, thanks,\u201d Harry replied, according to Page Six, which viewed the response in an Instagram video that has since been made private. Prince Harry continued, releasing the bit of information for which we have all been waiting; giving us a small taste of royal life; attempting to win us back after his grievous error regarding the car door:\n\n\u201cHe is getting so big.\u201d\n\nPrince Archie is getting so big. He is getting so big. He is growing. We know that now, and we are better for it. Whether it is enough to heal the damage Harry has caused due to his inability to follow royal protocol regarding car doors, well \u2026 of course, that is to be seen.", "description": "Prince Harry recently shared a pretty \u201cbig\u201d update about his and Meghan Markle\u2019s baby, Archie.
