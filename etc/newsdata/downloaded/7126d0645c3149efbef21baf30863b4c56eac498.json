Mitt Romney (R-UT) once again on Saturday, this time calling for the NeverTrumper to be impeached.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing that the Great People of Utah are considering their vote for their Pompous Senator, Mitt Romney, to be a big mistake. I agree! He is a fool who is playing right into the hands of the Do Nothing Democrats! #IMPEACHMITTROMNEY,\u201d the president wrote on Twitter.\n\nI\u2019m hearing that the Great People of Utah are considering their vote for their Pompous Senator, Mitt Romney, to be a big mistake.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2019\n\nIn a subsequent tweet, President Trump argued retired Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), an outspoken anti-Trump critic, was \u201cbetter\u201d than the Utah Republican.\n\nNo Kevin, Jeff Flake is better! https://t.co/IyENBffEjp \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2019\n\n\u201cNo Kevin, Jeff Flake is better!\u201d he tweeted in response to Fox News White House correspondent Kevin Corke, who asked, \u201cHas #MittRomney become the new #JeffFlake or is the latest back and forth much ado about nothing?\u201d\n\nDespite President Trump\u2019s wishes, senators are unimpeachable and Utah lacks state laws to recall a senator.\n\nA Utah Political Trends survey conducted in July, found Romney has the highest disapproval rating among the Salt Lake State\u2019s congressional lawmakers.\n\nEarlier Saturday, President Trump mocked Romney as an \u201cass\u201d after the failed Republican presidential candidate criticized Trump for bringing attention to the dealings of former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in China and Ukraine.\n\nPresident Trump wrote on Twitter.:\n\nMitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous \u201cass\u201d who has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him), and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn\u2019t give it to him). He is so bad for R\u2019s!\u201d President Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nMitt Romney never knew how to win.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2019\n\nThe president said in a separate tweet:\n\nSomebody please wake up Mitt Romney and tell him that my conversation with the Ukrainian President was a congenial and very appropriate one, and my statement on China pertained to corruption, not politics. If Mitt worked this hard on Obama, he could have won. Sadly, he choked!\n\nSomebody please wake up Mitt Romney and tell him that my conversation with the Ukrainian President was a congenial and very appropriate one, and my statement on China pertained to corruption, not politics.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2019\n\nOn Friday, Romney labeled President Trump\u2019s suggestion for foreign countries to probe the Biden family\u2019s business activities \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d Romney wrote on Twitter:\n\nWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated. By all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.", "description": "President Donald Trump took aim at Sen.
