Local authorities were called to the house, where they found thousands of fetal remains packed neatly in his garage. How the remains were preserved, authorities haven\u2019t said. But they are investigating how Klopfer transported the remains from his Indiana clinics to his home in Illinois.\n\nKlopfer hasn\u2019t practiced medicine since 2016, when his medical license was permanently suspended after the Indiana Medical Licensing Board found that Klopfer had illegally performed abortions on two 13-year-olds without filing paperwork that could have led to investigations into child sex abuse. Upon further investigation, the board discovered Klopfer hadn\u2019t been properly filing paperwork on the abortions performed at his South Bend, Gary, and Fort Wayne clinics for years.\n\nHe was charged with two misdemeanors, but the charges were later dismissed under the terms of a plea deal. Klopfer fought to keep his medical license, but his attempts were rejected.\n\nThe case of Ulrich Klopfer should shock the conscience. These unborn infants were his prizes. He kept them, stored them, and hid them from his family. Like a serial killer holding on to mementos from his victims, Klopfer returned to the unborn children in his garage.\n\nRarely does such brutality manifest itself in such an obvious and horrific way. The abortion industry is good at hiding its ugliness, disguising it behind neat Planned Parenthood brochures that advertise women\u2019s healthcare. Klopfer is what happens when the mask comes off.\n\nEven in the abortion industry, Klopfer\u2019s crimes are shocking. Few men and women could or would do what he did. Few abortion doctors revel in and treasure their work. Fewer Planned Parenthood employees would work for someone who did. Abortion is a medical procedure, nothing more, they say. Still, Klopfer should remind us of an important, ugly truth about the abortion industry: it desensitizes the soul. Abortion becomes nothing more than a medical procedure when the humanity of both patient and doctor are removed from the equation. Abortion isn\u2019t murder if the fetus isn\u2019t a person in the first place, right?\n\nThe abortion industry has become numb to its own cruelty. Sometimes it takes a man like Klopfer to remind us that it\u2019s still there under the surface, packed away in an Illinois garage.", "description": "The garage is where Ulrich Klopfer kept his trophies: 2,246 of them, each \u201cmedically preserved.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7ed58da/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5646x2964+0+206/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2Fa5%2Fe7%2Fc4ba39d62df52b32bdefa51658fc%2F9404cd4be10addad8d332b6c17e92099.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
