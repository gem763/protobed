There are some 14,000 US troops in Afghanistan, deployed at various bases across the country.\n\nKhalilzad is expected to meet Afghan and Nato officials to explain the draft agreement, which must still be approved by President Donald Trump before it can be signed. Khalilzad, a veteran Afghan\u2013American diplomat, has shared details of the draft with the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, and sought his opinion before firming up an agreement that could bring an end to America\u2019s longest military intervention overseas.\n\nHowever, Ghani\u2019s government is seeking clarifications from the United States on the draft agreement.", "description": "Bomb attack in centre of Kabul close to Afghan government buildings", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/269b0750e58149b2aedaabb181562910b01dea45/0_30_1674_1004/master/1674.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bd3710b8f843064b315f2c83c0cedefc", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
