Debunks GOP Conspiracy Theory", "language": "en", "text": "National intelligence inspector general Michael Atkinson, right, leaves a closed intelligence briefing Photo: Jacquelyn Martin/AP/Shutterstock\n\nLast Thursday, Sean Davis of the conservative news site The Federalist broke an explosive revelation. The Intelligence Community had secretly changed a requirement in its whistle-blower statute to allow whistle-blowers to report secondhand allegations, whereas firsthand knowledge had been required before. This suspicious rule change allegedly allowed the whistle-blower to accuse President Trump of misconduct despite lacking firsthand knowledge of said conduct. The shocking exposure of yet another Deep State plot quickly became the foundation for Trump\u2019s defenders as they fanned out across the media.\n\n\u201cThe hearsay rule was changed just a short period of time before the complaint was filed,\u201d claimed Senator Lindsey Graham. The whistle-blower \u201chas no firsthand knowledge,\u201d charged Congressman Jim Jordan on CNN, and when host Jake Tapper noted that firsthand knowledge is not required to file a complaint, Jordan shot back that this was only \u201cbecause they changed the form. You used to.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump demanded, in all caps, \u201cWHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT?\u201d\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy claimed, \u201cJust days before the Ukraine whistleblower came forward, the IC secretly removed that requirement from the complaint form,\u201d and promised that Republicans would \u201cnot rest until we have answers.\u201d\n\nThey had answers. They just didn\u2019t like them. Actual experts in intelligence law immediately pointed out that Davis\u2019s reporting was false and was based on a simple misreading of a change in the wording of a form.\n\nThen yesterday, the Intelligence Community\u2019s inspector general, Trump appointee Michael Atkinson, posted a short statement online correcting Davis. Using heavily bureaucratized language and the patient and polite tone city officials use to assure the local gadfly that the water department is not sending alien nodes through his plumbing, the I.G. made a few basic points. First, the rules governing whistle-blowers have not changed. At all.\n\nSecond, the I.G. had developed a new form for whistle-blowers to use to file their complaints because the old form may have been confusing. (\u201c[C]ertain language in those forms and, more specifically, the informational materials accompanying the forms, could be read \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 as suggesting that whistleblowers must possess first-hand information.\u201d) That\u2019s the change Davis seized upon \u2014 a clarification of the wording in the submission form, not a change in the requirement.\n\nThird, Atkinson noted that the entire issue is moot because the Trump whistle-blower did have firsthand knowledge. (\u201cThe whistleblower stated on the form that he or she possessed both first-hand and other information.\u201d) So no, the law was not changed to allow complaints without firsthand knowledge. And no, this wouldn\u2019t have mattered anyway, because the whistle-blower did have firsthand knowledge.\n\nIn a rational world, The Federalist would be publishing mortified corrections and Republicans would be engaged in soul-searching as to how such a simplistic fallacy had gained credence at the highest levels of their party. In a world where the conservative movement had at least some slight attachment to reality, the Federalistas would be quietly slinking away and changing the subject.\n\nBut in the actual world, they are continuing to insist they were right all along. The Federalist reporting team has not even developed its own alternative sources. Instead, they are plucking out sentences from the I.G. report that was written to correct their errors and claiming them as vindication.\n\nLots of people not reading actual text of ICIG statement. The statement admits that forms were changed, as reported. pic.twitter.com/gyFOuArzwx \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 30, 2019\n\nI missed this the first time I read -- ICIG says instructions that whistleblowers have first-hand knowledge was changed to no longer requiring first-hand knowledge in relation to press inquiries about this whistleblower complaint! THAT SURE IS INTERESTING. https://t.co/ytfuKxbwpl \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) October 1, 2019\n\nNot only did the IC IG admit tonight that it eliminated its requirement for first-hand evidence and changed its forms accordingly, it admitted that it changed its own whistleblower rules *because of the anti-Trump complaint.* https://t.co/Hch0L8DdIC pic.twitter.com/Iz9AGQOzR4 \u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) October 1, 2019\n\nNo! The letter says that the form changed but the requirement did not change. The HOW INTERESTING change is that the I.G. was trying to correct the confusion being spread by right-wing pseudo-journalists and clarified the language in a form, but the underlying requirements to submit a complaint did not change. Also, again, the whistle-blower did have firsthand knowledge, so even if the requirement had been weakened, it would not have had any relevance to this matter.\n\nIt\u2019s probably better that Trump\u2019s defenders simply claim the I.G. supports their erroneous stance, because the actual alternative would be for them to decide Atkinson is in cahoots with the Deep State cabal and have him fired and replaced with somebody from Fox News.", "description": "Republicans have seized upon an incorrect report in the conservative site The Federalist claiming the intelligence community eliminated a requirement that whistle-blowers have firsthand knowledge.
