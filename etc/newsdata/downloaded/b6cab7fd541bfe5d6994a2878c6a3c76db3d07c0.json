If the clubs cannot agree, then the committee will choose.\n\nThe Spanish league wanted the match to be moved from Barcelona to Madrid because of security concerns, with the return match automatically switched from Madrid to Barcelona. But the competitions committee rejected that idea, saying that it was against its rules to invert the order of the games.\n\nThe federation, in consultation with government officials, said Thursday it wasn\u2019t safe to play on the same day as the rally.\n\nThe Spanish league runs the top two soccer divisions in the country, while the federation controls regulations and matches for professional and amateur games.\n\nThe northeastern Catalonia region has seen violent protests for the last few days with police clashing with protesters angered by a Supreme Court decision to sentence nine separatist leaders to prison. Separatist groups have called for supporters to rally in Barcelona on Oct. 26, the original date of the match.\n\nThere appear to have been fears that protests could again get out of hand and make access difficult to the Camp Nou.\n\nCatalan independence flags are a regular feature at Barcelona\u2019s home games, as are collective shouts for \u201cindependence\u201d by separatist supporters.\n\nAbout half of Catalonia\u2019s 7.5 million residents support a break with Spain, according to polls.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Next week's \"cl\u00e1sico\" between Barcelona and Real Madrid was postponed Friday by the Spanish soccer federation to avoid coinciding with a large separatist rally in riot-stricken Catalonia.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/spain_soccer_la_liga_01362_c0-104-2500-1562_s1200x700.jpg?2d5ddaaeb405183379a395b29cf0e643d3db558f", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
