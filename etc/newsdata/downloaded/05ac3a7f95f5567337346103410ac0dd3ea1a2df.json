Letwin's just the useful idiot\".\n\nAfter he was accused of \"collusion\", Sir Oliver confirmed the pair had worked together and added \"I\u2019ve \u2018colluded' with the Lords.\"\n\nBut he said he would not describe such behaviour as collusion - simply that \"I think politicians should work together\" in a democracy.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAsked if Lord Pannick helped draft the legislation, he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: \u201cYes, we\u2019ve had some of the best lawyers in the land who are in the House of Lords working for us.\n\n\"Without being paid by anybody I may say, purely pro bono, and I\u2019m extremely grateful to them.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re putting forward legislation it should be proper professional legislation that really first class lawyers have looked at.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson had wanted to force MPs into a straight \"meaningful vote\" on his Brexit deal.\n\nBut instead, MPs voted 322-306 for an amendment to \"withhold\" approval for the deal, \"unless and until\" every part of it has passed into UK law.\n\n(Image: Dan Kitwood)\n\nSir Oliver insisted he wasn't trying to scupper Brexit - merely setting up an insurance policy to prevent no-deal by accident.\n\nHe feared there'd be a legal loophole if the deal still wasn't encoded in law by the time it was too late to change the October 31 deadline.\n\nDefending his actions today Sir Oliver said: \"Yesterday wasn\u2019t about the deal, despite all the hype.\n\n\"Yesterday was about the question, whether the Benn Act will still be effective and whether we\u2019ll get an extension, if for any reason we haven\u2019t got the deal completed by October 31.\n\n\"And that, I felt, and have continued to feel, is very important. We need the safeguard, the insurance policy that if we don\u2019t get this passed by October 31 we don\u2019t just crash out of the EU.\n\n\"That was what yesterday was about. Next week is about the deal and the Bill, I\u2019ll vote for the deal, I\u2019ll vote for the Bill.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMost (though not all) of those who backed his amendment were against Boris Johnson's deal - despite Sir Oliver being in favour.\n\nHe admitted sometimes \"you have to ally yourself with some strange people\u201d.\n\nBut he insisted \"I'd vote for any deal\" and said he will now put forward no further amendments.\n\n\"There will be no more Oliver Letwin amendments next week,\" he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely behind the government now.\n\n\"As long as they continue with this bill continue with the deal I will support it I will vote for it, as I did with Theresa May three times.\u201d", "description": "The ousted Tory MP confirmed he worked with Lord Pannick - but said that was a perfectly reasonable thing to do", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Pa", "Dan Kitwood"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20659223.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-Andrew-Marr-Show.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
