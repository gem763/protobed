In tonnage terms, the latest inflow totals 5.9 tons, and follows the addition of about 99.8 tons over the prior nine months.\n\nBullion hit the highest in more than six years in September as slower growth, the trade war and rate cuts spurred investor demand. Central banks have been major buyers too, especially in emerging markets. Official purchases will likely continue as protectionist policies and geopolitical concerns add to demand, according Suki Cooper, precious metals analyst at Standard Chartered Bank.\n\n\u201cGiven strained relations with the U.S., China needs a hedge against its large holdings of the dollar, and gold serves that function,\u201d said Howie Lee, an economist at Singapore-based Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. \u201cAs China becomes a superpower in its own right, I expect more gold-buying.\u201d\n\nThe PBOC\u2019s run of bullion-buying has come against the challenging backdrop of the trade war with the U.S. and marked slowdown in growth at home. While high-level negotiations are set to resume in Washington this week, Chinese officials are signaling they\u2019re increasingly reluctant to agree to a broad deal.\n\nSpot gold rose as much as 0.4% to $1,511.31 an ounce on Monday and traded at $1,507.58 in early Asian trade. While prices fell 3.2% in September, they are still up nearly 18% this year. The PBOC data were released at the weekend.\n\nAlong with China, Russia has also been adding substantial quantities of bullion. In the first six months, central banks worldwide picked up 374.1 tons, helping push total gold demand to a three-year high, the World Gold Council has said.\n\nWhile a 10th straight month of accumulation marks a steady buying pattern for the PBOC, China has in the past gone for long periods without disclosing moves in gold holdings. When the central bank announced a 57% jump in reserves to 53.3 million ounces in mid-2015, that was the first update in six years.\n\n(Updates to add comment in fourth paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ranjeetha Pakiam in Singapore at rpakiam@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Phoebe Sedgman at psedgman2@bloomberg.net, Jake Lloyd-Smith\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- China has added more than 100 tons of gold to its reserves since it resumed buying in December, reinforcing its standing as one of the major official accumulators as central banks stock up on the precious metal.The People\u2019s Bank of China picked up more gold last month, raising holdings", "authors": ["Ranjeetha Pakiam"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZtE.fNwyx2mJHl8GJwJzng--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/bc9221577d541d979071abbe35dc313e", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
