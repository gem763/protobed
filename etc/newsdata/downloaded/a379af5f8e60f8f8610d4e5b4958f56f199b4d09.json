She stops me from being a head-in-the-clouds actor p**ck.\n\n'As soon as I get home I\u2019m picking up the dog s**t in the courtyard, though I do have a courtyard which is p**ckish, to say the least.'\n\nIn March, the British actor's personal trainer Nick Lower uploaded a shirtless snap of the star on social media, which showcased his six pack and slender arms.\n\nNot impressed: While there a strong reaction from fans to his look, Simon has revealed that his wife Maureen McCann was far from impressed. Pictured together in July 2018\n\nDivisive: Some fans of the star appeared impressed by his dramatic transformation, while many of them expressed their concern that he had slimmed down too much\n\nAs well as giving a breakdown of Simon's fitness statistics, Nick wrote: '#SimonPegg 6 month body transformation for #InheritanceMovie The brief for this role was lean, VERY lean. It required a specific body shape & look.'\n\nFans were divided about the actor's dramatic transformation, with some stating that they were impressed with his new look, while many others expressed concerns that he had slimmed down too much.\n\nOver the summer, Shaun Of The Dead star Simon spoke with GQ Hype about the huge reaction to his body transformation, branding it 'weird' and claiming that his wife thought he 'looked ill'.\n\nTelling all: Speaking at MCM Comic Con in London on Sunday, he told MailOnline, 'I did have to get very, very skinny for a job I did this year and my wife was in tears about that\n\nWhile he dropped 19lbs for a movie role in which he had to be 'very lean', the actor admitted that his look was never meant to be 'aspirational'.\n\nHe said: 'The response from that picture was so weird... And the thing is, it wasn\u2019t meant to be an aspirational thing. It was a snapshot that my trainer took and I really didn\u2019t expect the furore that followed.\n\n'All I can think of is that people still think of me as that schlubby guy from Shaun Of The Dead.'\n\nSlender: During his appearance at the event, the Gloucestershire native still appeared slender\n\nElsewhere in his interview at MCM Comic Con on Sunday, Simon spoke about the unconventional way in which filmmaker JJ Abrams offers him film roles.\n\nHe said: 'I\u2019ve been offered roles by JJ via email. He goes straight to you, he doesn\u2019t do the whole agent thing. So I literally have an email somewhere which says, \u201cDo you want to play Scotty?\u201d\n\n'I got off the back of a flight from New York and I turned my phone on and it came through, and I was so disgusted because I thought, \u201cHow can you say that without some kind of dinner, wine, or some sort of sexual favour first?\"\n\n'I can\u2019t just say, yeah or sure. It took me three days to say yes and he was like, \u201cWell, do you want it or not?\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know! You\u2019re asking me to play Scotty.\u201d But eventually I said yes.'\n\nHuge reaction: Simon admitted that he found the huge reaction to his transformation 'weird'", "description": "Speaking at\u00a0MCM Comic Con in London on Sunday, he said: 'I did have to get very, very skinny for a job I did this year and my wife was in tears about that, because I kind of got down to just skin and bone.'", "authors": ["Ryan Smith", "Roxane Simons For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/21/20256704-0-image-a-58_1572212835305.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
