Prosecutors said she gave Rick Singer, the consultant at the center of the scheme, a sample of her son\u2019s handwriting to provide to proctor Mark Riddell.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBuckingham\u2019s son scored a 35 out of 36, after which she wired $35,000 to a bank account connected with Singer\u2019s dummy charity and said she would have her ex-husband pay another $15,000, according to CNN. A government sentencing memo indicated her ex-husband had no knowledge or involvement in the scheme. Prosecutors said she was arrested before she had a chance to conduct a similar operation for her daughter.\n\nThe sentence was significantly less than the six-month sentence sought by prosecutors. In a sentencing memo, Buckingham\u2019s lawyers wrote, \"Ms. Buckingham's acceptance of responsibility was immediate after her arrest because she already understood that she had committed a crime. Unlike other defendants, she never tried to convince herself that her actions were legitimate.\"\n\n\"She told her children on the day of her arrest that she would be pleading guilty. She had spent the day in jail, after having lost consciousness upon her arrest, and when she got home her first priority was making sure her children understood that she would be accepting responsibility for her crime,\" they added.\n\nOther parents caught up in the scandal include actresses Felicity Huffman, who pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 14 days, and Lori Loughlin, who has pleaded not guilty.", "description": "Author and CEO Jane Buckingham, writer of the parenting book \u201cThe Modern Girl\u2019s Guide to Motherhood,\u201d was sentenced to three weeks in prison Wednesday after pleading guilty to paying a proctor $50,000 to take the ACT exam for her son in connection", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/gavel_istock_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
