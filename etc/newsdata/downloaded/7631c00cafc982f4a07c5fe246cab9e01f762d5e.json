It also looked at the role of women in the Church's work, and environmental issues.\n\nThe Catholic Church is the oldest institution in the Western world, tracing its history back almost 2,000 years, and counts more than a billion members.\n\nWhy are priests so scarce in the Amazon?\n\nResidents of least 85% of villages in the region cannot attend Mass every week, Reuters news agency reports.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Deacons like Shainkiam Yampik Wananch minister to Catholics in the Peruvian Amazon\n\n\"Sometimes it takes not just months but even several years before a priest can return to a community to celebrate the Eucharist, offer the sacrament of reconciliation or anoint the sick,\" the synod document says.\n\nThree out of five bishops at the synod came from the nine Amazon countries, AFP news agency notes.\n\nHow would the change be justified?\n\nUnder the synod's proposal, passed by 128 votes to 41, married \"men of proven virtue\" could join the priesthood in remote parts of the region.\n\nAdvocates of the change argue that it would not be a reversal of the rule on celibacy for priests but an exemption, like that already given to married Anglican clerics who convert to Catholicism.\n\n\"Legitimate diversity does not harm the communion and unity of the Church, but expresses and serves it,\" the synod's final document says, as quoted by the Catholic News Agency.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference at the end of the synod, the Archbishop of Benevento, Cardinal Michael Czerny, explained the decision: \"Things have to change.\n\n\"We cannot keep repeating old responses to urgent problems and expect to get better results than we've been getting so far.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Is Pope Francis kissing goodbye to ring tradition?\n\nPope Francis is expected to issue his guidance on the issue by the end of the year.\n\nWhat was decided about women and the environment?\n\nThe bishops recognised that in the Amazon \"the majority of Catholic communities are led by women\".\n\nThey looked at the issue of ordaining women as deacons, who are a rank below priests in the Catholic Church, being allowed to celebrate weddings and baptisms but not to say Mass.\n\nWhile they did not endorse the idea, the bishops decided to consult with a papal commission on the subject.\n\nThe bishops also called on the Pope to make \"the acts and habits of pollution and destruction of the harmony of the environment\" an \"ecological sin\", AFP reports.\n\nHow did 'idols' disrupt the synod?\n\nPope Francis apologised after indigenous Amazonian statues were stolen from a church in Rome and dumped into the Tiber River during the assembly.\n\nThe five wooden statues of a naked, pregnant woman were taken from the church on Monday.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images\n\nUnidentified perpetrators - believed to be conservative Catholic militants - described the statues as \"idols\".\n\nThey later posted a video showing how the so-called Pachamama statues were stolen and then thrown in the river.\n\nPachamama is a goddess revered by indigenous communities in the Amazon.", "description": "The Pope will consider a proposal to allow married men to become priests in the Amazon region.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F8B7/production/_109417636_mediaitem109417634.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
