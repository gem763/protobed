But after reviewing five recent notable surveys, I believe many people are actually feeling three big financial pain points now.\n\nOverall, according to the Bank of America Workplace Benefits Report of 996 retirement-plan participants, just 55% of employees rate their financial wellness as good or excellent, down from 61% a year ago. \u201cThat\u2019s something to keep a close eye on,\u201d says Lisa Margeson, head of Retirement Client Experience and Communications at Bank of America.\n\nBank of America found that employees pay an average of $7,685 annually for out-of-pocket health expenses and health insurance premiums.\n\nHere\u2019s more about what the surveys show about today\u2019s financial pain points, and ways Americans and employers can relieve some of the stress:\n\nPain Point No. 1: Caregiving and family assistance\n\nThe financial \u2014 and sometimes emotional \u2014 stress faced by family caregivers and by parents assisting their grown children came up repeatedly in the Bank of America BAC, -2.50% survey, as well as the new Wells Fargo/Gallup Investor and Retirement Optimism Index survey and the 2019 American Family Survey from Brigham Young University\u2019s Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy.\n\nThe Wells Fargo/Gallup survey of 2,091 U.S. investors found that 45% have provided financial assistance to a parent or parent-in-law, an adult child, an adult sibling, a grandchild or another relative and 21% have provided personal assistance or care to them.\n\nIn the past year, they\u2019ve spent $10,000 on average financially supporting adult family members (not including college expenses for an adult child). \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to us that number is as large as it is,\u201d says Mary Sumners, regional president for the Northern Region at Wells Fargo WFC, -2.74% Advisors. And, she adds, \u201cmany felt [providing financial assistance to family members] would have an impact on their ability to save for retirement.\u201d\n\nNearly half of employees Bank of America surveyed (45%) said they perform caregiving duties for a family member. And 65% of caregivers for people other than their children said they spend 10 or more hours a month doing so. They they shell out a not insignificant $3,263 out-of-pocket annually, on average, on caregiving costs.\n\nBofA researchers say the percentage of workers who are also caregivers is significantly underestimated by employers.\n\nOne reason employers are in the dark, says Kevin Crain, managing director and head of workplace solutions for Bank of America, is the stigmatization of caregiving. That means, Crain says, \u201cwhether you step up and tell your employer\u201d that you have a parent who needs your help from time to time.\n\n\u201cI think this will become an increasingly growing topic,\u201d says Crain. \u201cWe need to get more employees to feel comfortable about stepping forward.\u201d\n\nThat starts with creating a workplace culture where employees are encouraged to talk about their caregiving responsibilities. Says Margeson: \u201cPart of it is the employer\u2019s responsibility to drive the conversation down to the manager level, not an HR department off somewhere else.\u201d\n\nThe top benefits caregiving employees want, according to the survey: leave of absence or sick days to give care to family members; flexible scheduling to accommodate caregiving needs and the ability to work from home when needed.\n\nIn The American Family Survey of 3,000 people, 10% of respondents said they wanted to take family leave but were unable to do so.\n\nOne suggestion for family caregivers from Sumners at Wells Fargo: \u201cGet together as a family and have a conversation\u201d about the parents\u2019 caregiving and financial needs.\n\nPain Point No. 2: Health costs\n\nThree of the surveys I reviewed cited health costs as a serious stressor for millions of Americans. That comes as no surprise, since the cost of health care is often one of the top issues for voters in the 2020 election.\n\nAs Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren said in the most recent debate: \u201cFamilies pay every time an insurance company says, \u2018Sorry, you can\u2019t see that specialist.\u2019 Every time an insurance company says, \u2018Sorry, that doctor is out of network. Sorry, we are not covering that prescription. Families are paying every time they don\u2019t get a prescription filled because they can\u2019t pay for it. They don\u2019t have a lump checked out because they can\u2019t afford the copay.\u201d\n\nBank of America found that employees pay an average of $7,685 annually for out-of-pocket health expenses and health insurance premiums. And, this survey said, 53% of employees have skipped or postponed medical appointments, procedures, hospital visits or the purchase of medications, health supplies or health insurance. \u201cThat\u2019s really scary,\u201d says Margeson.\n\nIn The American Family Survey, 14% of respondents said that in the past 12 months, someone in their household needed to see a doctor or go to the hospital but couldn\u2019t because of the cost; 11% said there was someone in their household who needed a medication and couldn\u2019t get it because of the cost.\n\n\u201cEven in economic good times, a meaningful percentage of Americans are not going to the doctor or getting their needed medications,\u201d says Chris Karpowitz, principal investigator of The American Family Survey and co-director of Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy at Brigham Young University. \u201cIn the past, we called these \u2018measures of economic crisis.\u2019\u201d\n\nOne problem, according to the surveys: Some employees don\u2019t understand or take advantage of their employer-sponsored health benefits, particularly Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) with high-deductible health plans. HSAs are tax-advantaged accounts to help pay for health costs.\n\nBank of America\u2019s survey found that only 11% of respondents correctly identified the basic attributes of HSAs. (Get this: just 7% of benefits decision makers at employers surveyed identified them correctly.)\n\nOne way to help reduce this pain point would be if more people saved for future health care expenses. According to the HSA Bank Health & Wealth Index, a survey of 2,000 adults, 40% of consumers never save for future health care expenses.\n\nPain Point No. 3: Not enough savings, too much debt\n\nIt hardly seems worth repeating how little many Americans have in emergency savings and retirement savings. But here\u2019s one distressing stat from the recent Clever debt survey of 1,000 adults: 31% of boomers and 32% of Gen Xers have no emergency savings funds.\n\nAs for retirement savings, Bank of America\u2019s survey showed that women have median retirement savings of $30,000 and men have $100,000. The disparity helps explain why just 43% of women BofA surveyed said they felt financially well. By contrast, 65% of men did.\n\nThe financial wellness result for women \u201cwas a concerning statistic, but not unexpected,\u201d Margeson said. \u201cWomen have a fundamentally different financial journey then men \u2014 they\u2019re more likely to spend time out of the workforce for caregiving responsibilities, they live five years longer than men, on average, and retire two years earlier.\u201d\n\nOn the flip side of savings, crushing debt loads remain a problem for many people.\n\nThe new Northwestern Mutual 2019 Planning & Progress Study of 2,003 adults found that of those with debt, 45% feel anxious about it monthly or more often. Gen X, according to the survey, has the highest debt level: $36,000, on average. Boomers are right behind, with $28,600\n\nAlso, the survey said, 15% of Americans expect to be in debt for the rest of their lives.\n\nAnd 31% of respondents are paying interest rates on credit cards higher than 15%. Boomers are more likely than other generations to hold four or more credit cards, according to Northwestern Mutual; 23% do.\n\nPut all these pain points together, and the financial picture for the public isn\u2019t so rosy, after all. \u201cThe main message from our survey is that many of our investors don\u2019t feel in control of their financial future,\u201d says Wells Fargo\u2019s Sumners.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling one or more of these pain points, you may want to meet with a financial adviser to discuss ways to address them. In fact, you may even want to do it with your parents or your millennial kids along with you, so the adviser and your family can better understand the whole picture and offer suggestions to help all of you.", "description": "The major pain points, and some ways Americans and employers can lighten the load.", "authors": ["Richard Eisenberg"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS131_na_pai_ZG_20190926104026.jpg"}
