(Michael Becker/Fox)\n\nTV critic\n\nWhy does prime-time network television exist? We ask this every fall.\n\nOne obvious answer has been quite plain for almost two decades now: ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox are the places to win singing and talent competitions; stage big musicals (ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Little Mermaid Live!\u201d will air Nov. 5); overcome obstacle courses; hand roses to Bachelorettes; survive social betrayal in remote jungles or a group house under hyper surveillance; dance the rumba with quasi-celebrities; reinvent old game shows; try not to get a sexually transmitted disease on a so-called love island; and, in our latest favorite, \u201cThe Masked Singer\u201d (returning Sept. 25 to Fox), try to guess the famous person singing songs in an elaborate costume.\n\nThe premium cable networks and streaming services long ago cornered the market on the top-notch dramas, comedies and miniseries \u2014 the Emmy bait. Snootier viewers (including critics) started to treat prime-time shows like clay pigeons at target practice, but the condescension came with inaccurate insults, the biggest of which is that \u201cnobody\u201d watches network TV. And that just isn\u2019t true.\n\nNielsen, which continues to deliver the most precise and reliable viewership data in an era when buzz often trumps factual research, estimates that there are 120.6 million homes ready to watch the 2019-20 TV season, which translates to 307.3 million potential viewers ages 2 and older. And 96.1 percent of U.S. households are getting TV over the air, by cable, digital, streaming Internet \u2014 you name it. That number isn\u2019t going down; it went up last year by a fraction of a percentage.\n\nNow, with the networks\u2019 parent companies (Disney, Comcast, CBS) getting more aggressive (and possessive) about where and how their branded shows will stream online, it\u2019s interesting to sense a newfound confidence in the way they pick and promote new shows.\n\n[12 new fall shows to watch (\u2018Unbelievable,\u2019 \u2018Evil,\u2019 \u2018Watchmen\u2019) and 5 you can probably skip]\n\nFor several seasons I\u2019ve wondered why the networks didn\u2019t simply fight off their competitors with better, edgier television shows. But they were right to stick to some proven formulas, such as the franchise crime and drama procedurals, those easy-to-watch stalwarts like CBS\u2019s \u201cNCIS\u201d shows or Dick Wolf\u2019s \u201cChicago\u201d titles for NBC. On their worst weeks, those shows get ratings that the buzzier dramas, such as HBO\u2019s extravagantly praised and parsed \u201cSuccession,\u201d can only dream of. The difference is millions of viewers.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s why Karey Burke, ABC\u2019s president of entertainment, came out with some actual swagger during a Q&A session with the Television Critics Association in August. Why apologize for being the person in charge of another fall season? Have you seen the size of ABC\u2019s actual and potential audiences? Have you seen how low the ratings are for some of these streaming-only shows?\n\n\n\n\u201cMixed-ish\u201d is one of the rare cases of a spinoff series premiering this fall. It tells the story of Rainbow Johnson\u2019s (\u201cBlack-ish\u201d) 1980s childhood. (Eric McCandless/ABC)\n\nGetting reliable data about streaming viewership (Netflix, et al.) is still next to impossible, but Burke cited one Nielsen statistic: \u201cOf the thousands of original episodes on streaming services each month, 5 percent perform below a 0.1 [Nielsen] rating \u2014 which is to say, they don\u2019t really perform at all,\u201d she said. They might get a billboard for a few weeks on Sunset Boulevard, she added, but then they disappear into the sunset.\n\nBurke also asked critics to consider a list of the 50 most-watched shows across all platforms last season: \u201cLook at how many were on broadcast \u2014 all but six. This surprised even me.\u201d\n\n[Ken Burns\u2019s \u2018Country Music\u2019 is full of high praise and heartbreak, but short on analysis]\n\nThere is a sense, these days, that network programming may yet pull through TV\u2019s platform renaissance, especially if younger audiences keep finding and consuming the content on a streaming platform \u2014 even if it\u2019s not called Netflix. Network execs always spin positive, but lately I like their chances.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because, as far as this fall is concerned, the shows finally seem a little better. Because the networks\u2019 schedules are mostly already filled with returning hits (or semi-hits), I haven\u2019t had to watch any reboots this fall, which seems like a miracle. Except for ABC\u2019s \u201cMixed-ish,\u201d I haven\u2019t had to watch more franchise spinoffs.\n\n\n\nTom Payne portrays a criminal psychologist whose father (Michael Sheen) is a serial killer in \u201cProdigal Son.\u201d (David Giesbrecht/Fox)\n\nBilly Gardell, left, and Folake Olowofoyeku play the title characters in \u201cBob Hearts Abishola,\u201d in which a businessman falls for his cardiac nurse. (Sonja Flemming/CBS)\n\nPilots this season are surprisingly strong and often topical: Robert and Michelle King\u2019s \u201cEvil\u201d on CBS is a scary rumination on demonology and technology. \u201cAll Rise,\u201d also on CBS, is a taut legal procedural with an eye on racial injustice. Chuck Lorre\u2019s latest comedy for the network, \u201cBob Hearts Abishola,\u201d verges on intercultural enlightenment while being tolerably cute; \u201cThe Unicorn\u201d stars Walton Goggins as a widowed father who, as one character says, \u201cis like catnip\u201d to women in the neighborhood \u2014 and the show is not as off-putting or mediocre as it might sound.\n\nI liked two ABC dramas \u2014 \u201cStumptown\u201d and \u201cEmergence\u201d \u2014 enough to include them on my list of fall\u2019s most promising shows. Fox has a couple of stinkers (the animated \u201cBless the Harts\u201d and the DNA drama \u201cAlmost Family\u201d), but also a potential standout: \u201cProdigal Son,\u201d which stars the excellent Michael Sheen as an imprisoned serial killer who lends his criminal-psychologist son (Tom Payne) some expertise in investigating cases.\n\n[Fall premiere dates for returning shows, including \u2018The Crown,\u2019 \u2018Mrs. Maisel\u2019 and \u2018This Is Us\u2019]\n\nNBC can keep its shoddy new Southern legal drama, \u201cBluff City Law,\u201d but I\u2019m glad the network has stayed focused on its comedy chops, especially with \u201cThe Good Place\u201d soon headed for the hereafter. I was charmed by \u201cSunnyside,\u201d starring Kal Penn as a disgraced politician who agrees to help a group of immigrants pursue U.S. citizenship, and \u201cPerfect Harmony,\u201d in which Bradley Whitford plays an Ivy League music professor helping a Kentucky church choir up its game.\n\nWill any of these shows turn television on its head or single-handedly save the prime-time commercial network business model? Certainly not, but they are notably solid representatives of their respective brands. At this stage of TV\u2019s metamorphosis, \u201cpretty good\u201d can look pretty great.", "description": "Rather than flail anxiously in the streaming era, the big broadcasters have some confident new offerings.", "authors": ["Hank Stuever", "Tv Critic", "Hank Stuever Has Been The Washington Post'S Tv Critic Since He Joined The Paper In As A Reporter For The Style Section", "Where He Covered Popular Culture."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jQ0Y1EeI68_S8A5uP-aL30i1gl4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5LUYCRWQCYI6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg"}
