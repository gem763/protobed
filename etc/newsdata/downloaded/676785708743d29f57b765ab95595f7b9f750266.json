But they never broke through against Cole, who went seven innings to win his 19th straight decision despite walking five batters for the second time in his career.\n\nCole pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the first and stranded nine runners through five, improving to 3-0 with a 0.40 ERA in three outings this post-season. Poised to become a prized free agent this fall who could command more than $200 million, he's putting together a dominant run that's beginning to rival some of baseball's greatest October pitching performances.\n\nThe 29-year-old right-hander, unbeaten in 25 starts since his last loss on May 22, allowed four hits and struck out seven. That ended a streak of 11 consecutive games with double-digit strikeouts \u2014 the previous big league record was eight. Cole led the majors in strikeouts this season.\n\nGame 4 in the best-of-seven playoff is scheduled for Wednesday night \u2014 but that could change. The gloomy weather forecast calls for a substantial storm with steady-to-heavy rain and wind all night in New York, potentially forcing a postponement that would likely alter pitching plans for both teams.\n\nGleyber Torres homered in the eighth off Houston reliever Joe Smith, one batter after replay umpires reversed a call and ruled Edwin Encarnacion out at first base. That led to a little trash and a ball being thrown onto the field before public address announcer Paul Olden reminded fans not to toss any objects out of the stands.\n\nRoberto Osuna got three quick outs in the ninth for a save.\n\nCole got away with several pitches in key situations and, other times, flashed the nasty breakings balls and 98-100 mph heat that have made him so unhittable in these playoffs \u2014 and unbeatable since May.\n\nWith two on in the fifth and the Yankees trailing 2-0, Didi Gregorius flied out to Reddick at the right field fence.\n\nHouston got a rally going in the seventh against scuffling reliever Adam Ottavino. George Springer walked and went to third on Altuve's perfectly executed hit-and run single through the right side.\n\nAfter some savvy baserunning by Springer to stay in a rundown long enough to get runners to second and third, one run scored on a wild pitch by Zack Britton.\n\nYuli Gurriel made it 4-0 with a sacrifice fly.", "description": "A gritty Gerrit Cole held the New York Yankees scoreless without his sharpest stuff, Jose Altuve sparked Houston at the plate and the Astros locked down a 4-1 victory Tuesday to take a 2-1 lead in the AL Championship Series.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5322174.1571184007!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1181306175.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
