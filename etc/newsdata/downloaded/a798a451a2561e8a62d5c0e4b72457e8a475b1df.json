Maybe you\u2019d like every room of your house to properly hear your Google Assistant voice commands, too?\n\nNow, Google is about to offer a way to extend both your internet and the range of your voice at once \u2014 with the just-announced Nest Wifi mesh router system.\n\nWe\u2019re learning about it right now live at Google\u2019s Pixel 4 hardware event: the two-pack is now composed of a new, bulbous \u201cRouter\u201d and a separate similarly shaped \u201cPoint\u201d that now extends your coverage 25 percent further than the previous generation \u2014 which Google claims is enough for a 3,800 square foot home. Only the \u201cPoint\u201d has a Google Assistant smart speaker built in, though.\n\nThe two-pack costs $269, and there\u2019s a three-pack for $349, with preorders today and devices available on November 4th. The Point will come in three different pastel colors, a white, brown, and blue, though it looks like the Router may only be white. Presumably, it\u2019s got an Ethernet port somewhere around back to plug in your modem, but Google hasn\u2019t shown the backs of these units so far.\n\nGoogle didn\u2019t mention whether it supports the new Wi-Fi 6 standard, but the company does claim these new routers are twice as fast as the previous generation. They\u2019ll also have Bluetooth Low Energy and support for the long-in-development-yet-still-nascent Thread smart home protocol that rival Eero has also been chasing a good long while, though Google says Thread capabilities aren\u2019t coming till 2020.\n\nGoogle says you can use the Assistant to control your Wi-Fi network, too, as easily as saying \u201cHey Google, pause the Wi-Fi for Daniel\u201d to get your kid\u2019s attention. (That\u2019s an exact example from Google\u2019s blog post.) We\u2019re definitely curious if it\u2019s anywhere near that easy.\n\nWe\u2019ll fill in more details as we go \u2014 but since we were kind of expecting this announcement, I\u2019ve already filled in some background you can read below.\n\nSince Google first introduced its Google Wifi system three years ago at $299 for a three-pack, mesh routers have become a popular way to eliminate Wi-Fi dead zones in a house, with every major router company offering a set. Google says its Wifi has been the best selling router in the US and Canada.\n\nBut while many rivals offer higher speeds and more power user features, Google\u2019s closest competition for a simpler Wi-Fi experience that blends into your house has been Eero \u2014 which also pioneered the idea of making mesh Wi-Fi cheaper and easier to install by replacing two of the three main routers and their cords with \u201cbeacons\u201d that can hang right off the power outlets on your walls.\n\nAmazon bought Eero earlier this year, giving Google\u2019s greatest rival in voice assistants a foothold in the Wi-Fi market, too, and it quickly introduced a new $99 Eero router that lets you shut off internet to specific devices with Alexa voice control. But now it appears Google may leapfrog Amazon by adding actual microphones to its hardware, so you don\u2019t need to additionally set up a Google smart speaker in that room of your house.\n\nDeveloping.
