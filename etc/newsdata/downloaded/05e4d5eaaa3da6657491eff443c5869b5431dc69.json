But who will live and who will die?\n\nAfter Cain discovers the shocking truth of what has been going on behind his back, he temporarily swallows his rage in order to trick Moira and Nate into joining him for a fishing trip. But before long, Moira realises that something is amiss \u2013 and, as Cain launches a ferocious attack on Nate, things get out of control.\n\nA series of terrible events brings Cain and Nate to the brink of death and as Moira ends up trapped underwater, a catastrophic explosion follows, leaving everyone at serious risk.\n\nNatalie J Robb, who plays Moira, told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Cain asks Moira to go below into the cabin to make them all bacon butties and a cup of tea whilst they talk. She\u2019s really uncomfortable down in the cabin as she can\u2019t really hear what they are saying up above and she is just thinking \u2013 \u201cOh no what is going on up there?\u201d\n\n\u2018She knows something is really weird when she hears a bump \u2013 a big thud from up on deck. First there is no noise, then suddenly this solid thud and of course she doesn\u2019t know who the thud belongs to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The fight was very well choreographed by the stunt coordinator and director it was really good and quite a long fight actually and equally matched too. It looks rather dangerous as they are on this tiny sailboat. The stunt doubles were brilliant, but Jeff and Jurell did the whole fight too.\u2019\n\nAs disaster takes place, Natalie promises spectacular scenes as an explosion brings the fight to an abrupt end \u2013 but she was remaining tight lipped over who would make it out alive.\n\nShe shared: \u2018We did see the explosion as that was the first thing that we did when we were away filming on location in the Halifax area. We watched all that before we did our scenes. It was good to see, it was really nice they set the bar high and from then on we worked up to that and shot all the before and aftermath. We shot all the sequences out of order. It was really good to do.\n\n\u2018It was a really good experience and I loved getting out of my comfort zone. Jeff and I found the underwater stuff much harder than the stuff we normally get to do. I think it is really good to push yourself and I believe if you can get out of your comfort zone regularly then you will always better yourself. It may be mental, physical or emotional but I think it\u2019s good to scare yourself at times.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Cain's revenge ends in disaster.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/00_emmerdale_wk_43_lake-d451_1570985957.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
