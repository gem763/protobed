While nearly every country will be impacted, longstanding economic weakness and the fragile state of its political institutions mean that a potential downturn will disproportionately batter Latin America.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest economies should work together to coordinate policies before the storm breaks. President Trump\u2019s conflict with Beijing should be resolved, shelved or postponed to prevent needlessly intensifying a downturn.\n\nHere\u2019s what the region is facing.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s economy imploded long before any signs of a potential recession in the United States surfaced, but lower oil prices will make matters worse. More than four million Venezuelans have fled the country. The number could rise to six million if economic conditions worsen.\n\nAn international downturn could also exacerbate Argentina\u2019s current economic crisis and lead to another default, as in 2001. Inflation has soared to 54 percent, interest rates even higher , and the peso has depreciated 30 percent since last month\u2019s primary election almost guaranteed a win for the center-left, Peronist candidate in the presidential elections in October. The price of soybeans \u2014 the country\u2019s main export \u2014 has dropped to half its mid-2012 peak .
