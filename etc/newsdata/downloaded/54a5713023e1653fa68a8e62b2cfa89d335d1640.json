Being thin was the thing,\" she said.\n\n\"It's health that's important, not appearance,\" she continued. \"I make choices that are good for me \u2014 and not just in my body \u2014 but for my soul, for my mind. And sometimes that's eating ice cream because I want to eat ice cream.\"\n\nThe actress now focuses on using her platform to emphasize an active lifestyle and prioritizing your health.\n\nYou can seek help by calling the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800.656.HOPE (4673) to be connected with a trained staff member from a sexual assault service provider in your area.", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/camila-mendes-gty-jt-190910_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
