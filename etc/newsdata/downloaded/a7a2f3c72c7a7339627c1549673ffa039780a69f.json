Those include a range of security tools that we have been working on.\n\n'Specifically to Northern Ireland, we are very conscious and we are working with all organisations, agencies to ensure that we remain safe.'", "description": "The extraordinary rebuke came as Home Secretary Priti Patel defended the government's tough stance towards negotiations with the EU.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/12/19652432-0-image-a-13_1570964736531.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
