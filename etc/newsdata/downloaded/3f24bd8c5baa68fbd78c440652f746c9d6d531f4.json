I was getting a lot of phone calls from some of the staff here.\n\n\u201cBoth of my sons had been to the game with me. When I dropped them off I answered my phone and it was one of the girls from the club making sure I was OK.\n\n\u201cI said: why? And they told me what had happened.\n\n(Image: SWNS.com)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cI then realised I had missed it by about two minutes because we had actually seen the fire brigade.\n\n\u201cI had my two kids in the car with me so it brought it home - 'wow', it could have been a lot worse for us.\n\n\u201cIf I had left two minutes later I could have witnessed it or even worse for my family and many other people too.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of public grief afterwards and not just from the football club and the fans.\n\n\u201cThe owners did a lot for the city of Leicester - especially for the children at the Leicester Royal Infirmary.\n\n(Image: Sunday Mirror)\n\n\u201cThat was one of the reasons why the outpouring was as great as it has been.\n\n\u201cIt has taken a lot of time to get over what happened but now the ball is rolling.\n\n\u201cI expect in years to come the club will make sure they progress through the Vichai Foundation and ensure the legacy will stand the test of time.\n\n\u201cIt is a massively important role for the club to play and the legacy of the owner and this football club will carry long into the future.\n\n\u201cThat is one of their ambitions. I don't think they are anywhere near finishing it. We are just at the beginning of something.\u201d\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIn the days following Vichai's death , the King Power was turned into a huge shrine amid thousands of floral tributes.\n\nMore are expected on Saturday with fans planning 'A Walk for Vichai' from the City's Magazine Square to the stadium ahead of the Burnley home game.\n\nOn the exact anniversary a week on Sunday, Leicester will open a memorial garden at the crash site where staff members Kaveporn Punpare and Nusara Suknamai, and pilots Eric Swaffer and Izabela Lechowicz also died in the south-east corner.\n\nThe memorial will ensure the victims are never forgotten after Vichai's son Top succeeded his dad at the helm of the club and their duty free empire.\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\n\nOther bigger projects are in the pipeline too , including a state-of-the-art \u00a3100million new training ground to be opened next summer to mark 10 years since the club's Thai takeover.\n\nDon't bet against it being named after the club's former chairman.\n\nWhile there are also plans to expand the ground from its current 32,000 capacity.\n\nBut more than anything, Vichai came to symbolise a determined attitude to strive for excellence which paved the way for the club's amazing 5,000-1 title success.\n\nIt is this outlook that the close-knit club and its squad continue to aspire to in what is shaping up to be a highly-promising season under manager Brendan Rodgers.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nRodgers, who succeeded Claude Puel in February, said: \u201cThe year has gone so fast but it comes upon us and the club will show the solidarity on and off the pitch that was really created by Vichai.\n\n\u201cThe feeling he gave people, the players and staff, you cannot buy that.\n\n\u201cHe was close to many people at the club and the players had a real affinity with him and still do.\n\n\u201cWhat I've tried to ensure since I've come in is to try to bring all that emotion out in a really positive way.\n\n\u201cBecause he was a fighter and he wanted his teams to fight and he wanted his people to fight for the very best.\n\n\"I think that's what we see in the performances of the players and what we've tried to do since I came in.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Leicester's players and fans will remember late owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha against Burnley this weekend", "authors": ["James Nursey", "Image", "Getty Images", "Swns.Com", "Pa", "Sunday Mirror", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Empics Sport", "Afp Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20647167.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FILES-FBL-ENG-PR-LEICESTER-BURNLEY-THAILAND.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
