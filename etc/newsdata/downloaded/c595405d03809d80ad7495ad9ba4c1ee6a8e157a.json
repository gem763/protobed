Even Wendy\u2019s joined in on the fight.\n\nAnalysts at alternative financial data firm Thinknum, Inc. noted that Popeyes\u2019 Twitter following nearly doubled after the exchange\u2014going from 106,000 followers to 191,000 followers at the time of this article. It didn\u2019t harm Chick-Fil-A\u2019s or Wendy\u2019s plus million following, but it did start a frenzy no one expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom selling out of inventory in two weeks to irate customers who have pulled out a gun on Popeyes employees or threatened a lawsuit over the shortage\u2014the marketing tactic was overwhelmingly a hit.\n\nDespite other reports of long lines, overwhelmed staff and pandemonium, Popeyes\u2019 promised online that the in-demand sandwich will make a comeback.\n\nIf Popeyes can keep up the momentum it built up through social media, that could mean trouble to its fast food competitors. At least that\u2019s what KeyBanc Capital Market\u2019s Eric Gonzalez implied in a report by Barron\u2019s, which is published by the Dow Jones & Company.\n\nGonzalez analyzed the potential impact Popeyes\u2019 chicken sandwich can have on its Canadian parent company, Restaurant Brands International, and how it stacks up against other publicly traded fast food brands.\n\nRestaurant Brands, owner of Popeyes and Burger King\n\nOverweight rating: $85 price target, according to Gonzalez.\n\nTicker Security Last Change %Chg QSR n.a. 71.68 -0.12 -0.17%\n\nGonzalez based his estimates on proprietary data sets, which led him to conclude that Popeyes\u2019 same-store sales growth will increase by 8 percent in the third quarter.\n\nHe estimated the chicken sandwich may have accounted for about 30 percent of sales during its availability window.\n\nGonzalez added that this figure was closer to 40 percent at the select high volume Popeyes restaurants he predicted to have sold approximately 1,000 sandwiches per day.\n\n\u201cOur analysis of geolocation data implies the chain doubled its share of fast food industry traffic at its peak,\u201d Gonzalez said. This data also suggested that Popeyes held on to some of the traffic after the sandwich was removed from the menu.\n\nAdditionally, he made it a point to mention that his estimate for 8 percent same-store sales growth at Popeyes could be conservative.\n\nIn his own words, Gonzalez said the Popeyes chicken sandwich launch and Twitter debate was a \u201cviral sensation that would disrupt the fast food industry.\u201d\n\nThat disruption he talked about is likely to shape the fast food category\u2019s third quarter results and competing bystanders.\n\nGonzalez noted the eagerness surrounding Popeyes\u2019 chicken sandwich was so high, it inadvertently took away excitement from its sister company Burger King and the meatless Impossible Whopper campaign.\n\nHe went on to add that he raised Burger King\u2019s third quarter same-store sales estimates. \u201cOur positive revisions are tempered by the impact of Popeyes\u2019 share gains,\u201d Gonzalez said.\n\nWendy\u2019s\n\nSector weight: $22.38 price target, according to Gonzalez.\n\nAmy Schumer and Alyssa Milano urged people to boycott Wendy's.

Though, this has happened while Popeyes mania has died down.\n\nGonzalez elaborated on his predictions by saying Wendy\u2019s system-wide same-store sales will grow 3 percent in the third quarter. His prior estimate was at 2.5 percent.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s\n\nOverweight rating: $235 price target, according to Gonzalez.\n\nFILE - This Tuesday, June 28, 2016, file photo shows a McDonald's sign at one of the company's restaurants in Miami.

He also maintained his estimate of a 5 percent same-store-sales growth.\n\nHowever, Gonzalez told Barron\u2019s he sees a limited upswing to that estimate.\n\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s had a solid July largely due to a rising average check even as it struggles at breakfast,\u201d he noted.\n\nConversely, when it comes to same-store-sales trends, Gonzalez said it \u201ctook a step down in the second half of August, coinciding with Popeyes\u2019 chicken sandwich, and have only partially recovered since.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nHe added that his estimate assumes same-store-sales trends will normalize in September thanks to McDonald\u2019s upcoming Spicy BBQ Chicken Sandwich and Spicy BBQ Chicken Tenders, which will be available starting Sept. 11.\n\nCounting in the fast food chains other promotions, Gonzalez said, \u201cWe no longer view our estimate as conservative.\u201d", "description": "Don't count the Popeyes chicken sandwich out just yet, the momentum is still leaving a lasting impression on fast food stocks.", "authors": ["Cortney Moore"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-EBzoEDVX4AAbUS7.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
