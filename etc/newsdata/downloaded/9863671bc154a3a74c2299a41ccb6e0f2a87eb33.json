Ace Max Scherzer (10-5, 2.56) is slated to make start on Friday night, which is Anthony Rendon bobblehead night.\n\nThe Nationals entered Thursday\u2019s contest at Minnesota with an 80-64 record. The Nationals are ahead in the wild-card race and, if they stay there, would host a one-game playoff Oct. 1.\n\nBut Washington has one of the most difficult schedules down the stretch of any playoff contender, with 14 of their last 17 games against teams with winning records. That begins Friday against the Braves, who were 91-56 before Thursday\u2019s game in Philadelphia. Atlanta, which won the division last season, was 9\u00bd games ahead of the Nationals before Thursday.\n\nThe Braves\u2019 offense is paced by first baseman Freddie Freeman (38 homers through Wednesday), third baseman Josh Donaldson (37) and outfielder Ronald Acuna, Jr. (38).\n\nOn the mound, young pitchers such as Mike Soroka (11-4, 2.67) and Max Fried (16-5, 4.02) have been vital cogs, while Atlanta reliever Chris Martin had an immaculate inning in the seventh Wednesday at Philadelphia, fanning three Phillies batters on nine pitches.\n\nReliever Shane Greene, acquired from the Detroit Tigers in late July, pitched a scoreless eighth and new closer Mark Melancon pitched the ninth in the 3-1 victory.\n\nThat combination of Martin, Greene and former Nationals closer Melancon could be used in the playoffs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the formula,\u201d analyst Tim Kurkjian said during the ESPN telecast Wednesday.\n\nAtlanta had a 4.34 bullpen ERA through Wednesday to rank sixth in the National League, while the Nationals were last of 15 teams at 5.77. The Nationals are 7-9 this year against the Braves.\n\nOther wild-card contenders in the National League hoping to catch Washington are:\n\n\u2981 Chicago Cubs (77-68 through Wednesday): Standout shortstop Javier Baez is injured and is expected to miss the rest of regular-season play. The Cubs begin a series at home Friday with the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\n\u2981 Milwaukee Brewers (77-68): Outfielder Christian Yelich, last year\u2019s MVP, is done for the season after fouling a ball off his kneecap Tuesday. But the Brewers won their sixth in a row Wednesday, as closer Josh Hader recorded his 30th save. Hader is a native of Millersville, Maryland. The Brewers begin a series Friday at the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\n\u2981 Philadelphia Phillies (75-70): The Phillies host the Boston Red Sox this weekend and play five games in Washington the last week of the season.\n\n\u2981 New York Mets (75-70): The Mets had won six of 10 after beating Arizona on Wednesday. New York hosts the Dodgers, who have clinched the National League West, this weekend.\n\n\u2981 Arizona Diamondbacks (75-71): The Diamondbacks had one of the easier schedules down the stretch among contenders but lost for the fourth game in a row Wednesday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
