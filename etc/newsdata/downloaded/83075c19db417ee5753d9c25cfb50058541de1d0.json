And Amazon? It's one of the biggest companies in the world, of course.\n\nBut way back in the summer of 1998, Bezos' Amazon was still a fledgling startup \u2014 and Bezos was using a recycled door as a desk.\n\nIt wasn't just Bezos who was using the makeshift desk, though.\n\n\"His desk, and the desks of the two other people he shared the office with, were made of doors mounted atop 4 \u00d7 4 wooden legs, braced with triangular metal pieces,\" Netflix's first CEO Marc Randolph writes in a newly published Wall Street Journal story. \"I suddenly realized that every desk I'd seen in that office was the same.\"\n\nThe recycled door desk has gone on to become a legend within Amazon \u2014 the company even created a video showing how to create your own:\n\nBut the makeshift desks weren't a measure of Amazon not having enough money to pay for, you know, actual desks.\n\nInstead, as Randolph remembers Bezos telling him, it was a \"deliberate message.\" Specifically: \"It's a way of saying that we spend money on things that affect our customers, not on things that don't.\"\n\nIt may sound extreme, but it's this obsessive focus on customers above all else that defines Amazon \u2014 and that has defined Amazon's leader, Jeff Bezos, as the company has grown from an early ecommerce company to an international retail giant.\n\nA photo of an early Amazon \"door desk.\" Note the metal brackets on the right side!
