However, investigators have only definitively identified the remains of one of the 43.\n\nLopez Obrador, who took office in December, promised during his election campaign to launch a truth commission to find out what happened to the students.", "description": "Mexican prosecutors will investigate officials who under the previous government handled a \"discredited\" probe into the 2014 disappearance of 43 student teachers, the attorney general's office said on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
