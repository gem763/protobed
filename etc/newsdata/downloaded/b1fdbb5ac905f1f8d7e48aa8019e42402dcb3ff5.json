London protesters keep the cry alive.", "language": "en", "text": "The defeat does not halt Brexit. But it does inject a serious dose of uncertainty about the way forward.\n\nFor supporters of a referendum redo, that gives them a fresh dash of hope \u2014 even though another Brexit plebiscite still appears an unlikely prospect.\n\nAD\n\nHundreds of thousands of protesters \u2014 up to 1 million, according to organizers \u2014 spilled onto the streets of London even as lawmakers gathered for the pivotal vote on Brexit.\n\nThe \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote rally\u201d called for a fresh Brexit vote \u2014 more than three years after the first stunning result to leave the E.U. family.\n\nSome marchers held placards that read \u201cBrexit is a dog\u2019s breakfast\u201d and \u201cStop Brexit, Have Tea.\u201d Many wore a yellow anti-Brexit sticker on their lapels, including John le Carr\u00e9, the best-selling author of spy novels. Small dogs donned E.U.-blue sweaters.\n\nAD\n\nAddressing the crowds, \u201cStar Trek\u201d actor Patrick Stewart noted how many more people were there compared to a rally of about 1,000 people he addressed at a similar event in early 2018.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWell, I say to you all today, there\u2019s more than a thousand of us now, isn\u2019t there? We haven\u2019t just filled a nice bar, we\u2019ve taken over an entire city!\u201d he said.\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan told the crowds, \u201cLook around, this is what democracy looks like.\u201d\n\nJohnson dismissed any chance for a second referendum, sticking to his motto of \u201cdo or die\u201d to leave the bloc by Oct. 31.\n\nVideo posted on social media showed senior Conservative politicians \u2014 allies of Johnson \u2014 being jeered at by demonstrators as they left Parliament. Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, tweeted: \u201cWhy do the so called \u2018People\u2019s Vote\u2019 protesters think it\u2019s ok to abuse, intimidate and scream in the face of someone they don\u2019t agree with? So frightening, and so grateful to the police.\u201d\n\nNicholas Cook, 61, a lawyer standing near Big Ben, said Johnson\u2019s deal was a bad one.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Brexit for? What\u2019s the tangible benefit? No one has given us any idea, any real point of difference as to why this is a good idea, other than \u2018gaining control,\u2019 whatever that means,\u201d he said.\n\nIn June 2016, Britons voted 52 percent to 48 percent to leave the E.U. Three years on, polls show that Britons would vote, by a similarly small margin, to stay in with the 28 other E.U. nations.\n\nPollsters say that it\u2019s not that people have changed their minds, but rather that some older voters have died and young people are overwhelmingly pro-E.U.\n\n\u201cIf politicians voted on it three times and couldn\u2019t make up their minds, it should go back to the people,\u201d said Clare O\u2019Neill, 22, an education worker.\n\nAD\n\nBrenda Beckett, 56, a school administrator, said she was marching on behalf of herself and her kids.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have two children who speak fluent Spanish, and they would like to work freely in Spain if they could. But once we leave the E.U., they would have to jump through hoops. It\u2019s a right we had in our 20s and 30s, and I feel like they should, too,\u201d she said.\n\nJohnson said that the way to heal the rift in Britain would be for Britain to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d and to leave the E.U. by the end of the month.\n\nKevin Kibble, 65, a charity worker standing near Westminster subway station, said that the best way to heal divisions would be to revoke the E.U. divorce papers filed by Britain, known as Article 50. But he predicted that even if Johnson does ultimately steer Britain out of the E.U., it would only be temporary.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf we are thrown out, we will go back in,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is only one place for us. We are a tiny little island, and we\u2019re a part of Europe whether we like it or not.\u201d\n\nWilliam Booth in London contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets as Boris Johnson lost a key vote in Parliament.", "authors": ["Karla Adam", "London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/sA7Z4N_ZOzRKY8whIxiTBm2i7Ig=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UT2YIUXSUYI6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
