While markets were volatile on a flare-up in trade relations with China, widespread global monetary policy easing helped the broader market to a large extent.\n\nOverall, the S&P 500 lost about 0.1% in Q3, the Dow Jones added about 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.9%. All-world ETF iShares MSCI ACWI ETF ACWI retreated 1.2% in the third quarter.\n\nLet\u2019s see how investors reacted to this situation and parked their money in the third quarter. The data is from etf.com (as of Sep 30, 2019).\n\nS&P 500 Win\n\nDespite subdued performance of the S&P 500,iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) garnered about $8.01 billion and $4.16 billion in assets in the third quarter. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY raked in about $2.85 billion in assets.\n\nGold Glitters\n\nGold bullion ETF SPDR Gold Trust GLD raked in about $6.05 billion in assets.Gold prices have been on a tear of late, with GLD rallying 8% in the third quarter (as of Sep 27, 2019) against the S&P 500\u2019s 0.1% loss. Heightened tensions related to the U.S.-China trade war in recent months led to the upside. Also, a barrage of rate cuts, Brexit uncertainty and the upcoming U.S. presidential election have played a crucial role in boosting the yellow metal (read: 5 Reasons to Buy Gold ETFs as Price May Touch $2000).\n\nLow Volatility Prevails\n\nThe U.S. market was subdued, taking the spotlight away from low-volatility products. These apparently safe products, which normally do not surge in a bull market but offer protection in troubled times, were much in demand in the third quarter. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, tariff worries, overvaluation worries \u2014 all have contributed to investors\u2019 interest in low-volatility products. iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol U.S.A. ETF USMV has attracted about $5.27 billion in assets in the third quarter.\n\nInternational Bonds Rule\n\nAs several international economies cut rates in the third quarter, bond yields fell and international bond fund Vanguard Total International Bond ETF (BNDX) hauled in about $4.18 billion in assets. In fact, the Fed enacted two rate cuts in the third quarter, which dragged down the treasury bond yields and pushed investors toward Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND). The fund hauled in about $3.21 billion in assets.\n\nSheen for Small-Caps Rekindle\n\nSmall caps, which have been under pressure, were on investors\u2019 favor. Small-cap ETF iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM accumulated about $2.70 billion in assets in the quarter. A dovish Fed, trade war tensions, global growth worries, geopolitical risks, compelling valuation and a decently growing U.S. economy have probably worked in favor of pint-sized stocks.\n\nEmerging Market ETFs Lost\n\nTrade tensions dealt a blow to the emerging market bloc.iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) and iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG) lost about $5.7 billion and $2.44 billion in the quarter (read: ETF Asset Report of September).\n\nFinancial Stocks Shed Assets\n\nFinancial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) lost about $1.80 billion in assets in the quarter due to low-yield environment (read: Guide to 10 Most-Heavily Traded ETFs).\n\nWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?\n\nZacks\u2019 free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.
