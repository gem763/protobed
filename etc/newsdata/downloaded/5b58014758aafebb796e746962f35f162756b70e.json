When two police officers knocked on my door to tell me that Gary was dead, my whole world came crashing down,\" said Mr Clarkson's mum in her statement.\n\n(Image: Hull Live/MEN MEDIA)\n\n\"It was as if I was in a nightmare that I can\u2019t wake up from and I am still like that one year on.\n\n\"Gary should still have had plenty of years to live and enjoy his life.\n\n\"He only had two days left before he was going to start at a new job and move away with his girlfriend.\n\n\"But due to Brodie Palmer's idiotic driving, I will never be able to hear Gary's voice again, never see him again, never be able to spend a birthday or a Christmas with him again and I can't bear it.\n\n\"I keep thinking, why was it my son that died? It should have been the driver.\n\n\"I always wonder to myself, what if Gary had rung in sick that day and not gone to work? What if he was set to have moved in with his girlfriend any earlier? What if he hadn't have just got in that van? If he'd any of these things happened he would still be alive.\"\n\nIn her statement, Mr Clarkson's mum went on to say that the driver had \"no shame or guilt\" following the crash.\n\n\"The driver has no shame or guilt in what he is done and has just gone back to work at the same company and carried on. I'm so angry and will never forgive or forget and want justice.\n\n\"Brodie's parents still have him, but we don't have Gary. It's the most painful thing for a parent to go through when their child dies first and it's something that should never happen.\n\n\"I never said goodbye and losing Gary has left me heartbroken.\n\n\"I think of Gary every day and he will always be missed.\"\n\nPaying tribute to Mr Clarkson in a victim impact statement, his girlfriend expressed her anger towards the defendant for \"taking Gary away from her\" and said that she had lost \"the love of her life.\"\n\n\u201cGary was my absolute world but my whole world turned around when I got the devastating news on June 27. Every single morning I wake up and think about the plans we had made,\" she said.\n\n\"I was very unhappy but my Gary changed that as he made me so happy. Your carelessness ended his life at a time when we should have been starting our new life together.\n\n\"You have the future to look forward to - all I have is heartbreak and memories.\n\n\"Gary is the love of my life but he has been taken from me by you.\"\n\nProsecuting the case, Chris Smith told the court that the defendant was unable to give any explanation for not being able to control the vehicle and keep it on the carriageway on the \"dry and bright day\" that the accident happened.\n\nMr Smith gave evidence that an eyewitness coming in the opposite direction saw the van \u201crocking and out of control\u201d and pulled over out of concern for her own safety.\n\n\"The vehicle left part of the carriageway with the nearside wheels entering the soft grass verge that neighbours the tarmac. It left the road and entered a drainage ditch before it hit a short tree line,\" said Mr Smith.\n\n\"It was decent downwards slope and once the vehicle was left in an irrecoverable state with extensive damage to the vehicle. The defendant was able to walk away from the vehicle but Gary was left trapped inside and unconscious.\n\n\"He tragically stopped breathing while paramedics were on the way to save him and he was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\n\"It is hard to say what happened other than there was insufficient regard and lack of care being paid to driving a commercial vehicle of some weight down a perfectly straight road. The defendant was not applying himself sufficiently to the management of the vehicle.\"\n\nThe court heard that Palmer told police he hit a dip in the road at 50mph and went \"totally off course\" and \"had no time to brake\".\n\nA reconstruction saw a similar vehicle drive over \"without such difficulty\" and the van was also found to be without fault, so Mr Smith argued that the only cause of the accident could be \"driver error\".\n\nAlex Jamieson, defending, read out a letter from Palmer, apologising and accepting full responsibility for the death of Mr Clarkson, who he considered a friend.\n\nThe pair worked for Green Team, an organisation which provides gardening and socialising services for people who are disabled and elderly, with Mr Palmer volunteering there for more than two years before he was taken on as a staff member.\n\n\"I fully accept that I'm responsible for Gary's death. I was the driver of the vehicle and he was my passenger so I was responsible for keeping him safe,\" he said.\n\n\"He was not only my passenger, but my work colleague and I considered him a friend.\n\n\"My guilty plea is to acknowledge what I did and take responsibility and I understand that the anger from Gary's family must be unsurmountable.\n\n\"I think about Gary and his family every day and there is no way I can appreciate the pain, loss and suffering that they have gone through.\n\n\"Gary was a quiet man that kept himself to himself but when I was with him, he would always open up to me and have a joke and he was always quick to help others in the group.\n\n\u201cMy heart goes out to his family and I know my words can never return to them what I have lost, but I wish to say to them I am so sorry.\u201d\n\nMitigating for Palmer, Mr Jamieson produced good character references from his manager and family.\n\nIn the statements, Palmer was described as a good driver with a clean record since he passed his test in 2011 and as a man that liked to help others.\n\nSince the tragedy Palmer has been unable to go back to work, and in his defence, Mr Jamieson said that the defendant has become depressed since the crash.\n\n\"The shadow of the event has fallen very darkly on the defendant. Mr Clarkson was a close friend of his and he killed him, which he has to deal with and think about every day,\" he said.\n\n\"All who know him say that he has become withdrawn and leaves the house little, is resigned and has retreated from his social circle and are conscious of his wellbeing.\n\n\"He is depressed and cries himself to sleep and needs help to work on his emotional wellbeing.\"\n\nJudge David Tremberg told Palmer, who admitted causing death by careless driving, that whatever sentence he passed \"cannot undo the harm done\" and told the court that his sentence is in \"no way designed to put a value on human life.\"\n\n\"You lost control of the vehicle, a commercial vehicle, in circumstances where there was no objective reason to have done so if you had been exercising any meaningful degree of care\",\" said Judge Tremberg.\n\n\"The victim impact statements set out in \u201cclear and painful terms the enduring legacy of your foreseeable and avoidable lack of care.\n\n\"You are a young man from a decent family with a pro-social outlook and you lost a friend and colleague and I believe that your remorse is genuine.\n\n\"You have experienced physical harm, but also mental anguish and your parents have described in their observation that you are suffering survivor's guilt and are feeling isolated and depressed and that it is hard for you to move on from such a catastrophic event.\"\n\nThe judge handed Palmer a four-month jail term, suspended for two years, 100 hours of unpaid work, 15 days of community rehabilitation and disqualified him from driving for two years.", "description": "Brodie Palmer appeared in Hull Crown Court charged with causing the death of Gary Clarkson", "authors": ["Anna Riley", "Image", "Hull Live Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20470550.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHPP_051019Slug_2409JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
