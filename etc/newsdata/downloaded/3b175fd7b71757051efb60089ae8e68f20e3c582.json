Their strike with teachers has closed school", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Chicago public school teachers say they're walking the picket lines to get more resources for students and smaller class sizes, not more money in their pockets. teachers. They went on strike Thursday after failing to reach a contract deal. (Oct. 17) AP, AP\n\nCHICAGO \u2014 Whenever her two kids would ask to go to Chuck E. Cheese, Evelyn Davis West would check her wallet.\n\n\u201cI would hate to tell them, 'Well, Mommy only has five dollars, so I hope there\u2019s a dollar meal.' That feeling was very gut-wrenching,\" West said.\n\nLife on the hourly wages of a Chicago Public Schools staff worker has never been easy, West said. Staff workers teach students one-on-one, scrub schools clean, keep kids in line on the bus \u2014 and more than half earn less than $35,360 a year, according to the Service Employees International Union, which represents the workers.\n\nThat doesn't go far in Chicago. For a two-person household in Cook County, the Department of Housing and Urban Development defines low-income as $57,050 a year and very low-income as $35,650 a year.\n\nUnion members say worker pay is among the key points driving approximately 7,500 CPS staffers \u2014 including special education assistants, security guards, janitors, bus aides and more \u2014 to join Chicago teachers on strike. After walking out Thursday, educators were expected to be back on picket lines at 6:30 a.m. Friday. Class for about 360,000 students is canceled until the strike ends, although buildings are open for students who need shelter, me or supervision by administrators.\n\nA day without teachers: 32,000+ educators in Chicago went on strike\n\nMembers of CTU and SEIU march in downtown Chicago on Oct. 14, 2019.

The support staff's campaign places a greater emphasis on compensation.\n\nWhile Chicago teachers on average earn nearly $79,000, and even a second-year teacher earns nearly $54,000, many school clerks and teaching assistants are living paycheck to paycheck. Many work second or third jobs, and some earn just $28,000 a year, according to CTU. Two-thirds of them qualify for free and reduced-price lunch for their children.\n\nThe school district says it's already offered staffers a raise, and it can't afford to give them more. Under the city's proposed contract, CPS workers, along with teachers, would receive a 16% raise over five years.\n\nCPS strike: What you need to know\n\nThat's in a city where you need to earn at least $48,480 a year to afford a two-bedroom apartment, according to a 2019 report by the National Low Income Housing Association.\n\nAs a second-grade teacher, Evelyn Davis West said she recalls making about $42,000 a year. She left her job in 2002 to have two children, but, when her second child was old enough to go to kindergarten, West went back to work \u2014 this time, as a bus aide. She recalls \u201cworking off crumbs,\" making somewhere between $18,000 and $20,000 at that time.\n\n\u201cThat was very hard,\" West said. \"Being at that salary, being a bus monitor, it makes you feel so bad, so low, like you\u2019re a loser. ... When you\u2019re making $11.15 an hour, that didn\u2019t seem right. And it was like no one cared.\u201d\n\nWest searched for a higher-paying position, and she became a special education classroom assistant in 2014, initially earning less than $30,000 a year.\n\nAccording to SEIU, special education assistants have a current starting rate of $31,720 per year and an average salary of about $36,000 per year.\n\nNow, at 49, with a bachelor's degree and a family of four, West said she makes $34,000 a year. For a four-bedroom home in the Ashburn neighborhood on Chicago's South Side, West pays $1,690.40 a month, she said.\n\nEvelyn Davis West, 49, poses with a sign at SEIU Local 73 in Chicago on Oct. 16, 2019.

Right now, keeping it real, I can buy a loaf of bread and a jar of peanut butter,\" West said.\n\nWest estimated that she'd need to be making at least $50,000 a year to have a \u201cliving wage.\"\n\nAlong with a raise, workers are also demanding staff \"stop being pulled into random assignments\" outside their job descriptions and asking the school to stop contracting with private facilities management companies.\n\nTeachers in America:No matter where they work or what they're paid, they feel disrespect\n\nEven as a full-time special education classroom assistant, West finds herself juggling various roles.\n\nIn one kindergarten classroom of 30 kids, West works with three children who have Individualized Education Programs for their special needs. One student uses a wheelchair, and the other communicates via a tablet. Both students should be working one-on-one with a staff member, West said, but she's \"shared\" between them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m constantly being pulled to do other jobs,\" West said. \"I\u2019m pulled away to be a lunch and recess monitor. I\u2019m pulled away to co-teach, to do bus monitoring ... to be security. It\u2019s constantly like being pulled like a rubber band.\"\n\nJonathan Williams (left) joins the picket line outside Wilma Rudolph Learning Center in Chicago on Oct. 17, 2019. (Photo: Grace Hauck)\n\nAnother special education classroom assistant, Jonathan Williams, said the strike is about securing \"the basic necessities in life.\"\n\nIn his current role, Williams, 37, works with six students who require one-on-one assistance.\n\nEven though his school has a nurse, Williams said that some of his students have epilepsy, and, in some cases, he must call an ambulance if a seizure lasts longer than one minute.\n\nJonathan and Crystal Williams pose with their daughters Karson, Kennedy and Kaydence.

He now earns $38,000 a year as the sole breadwinner for his family of five. His wife, Crystal, has multiple sclerosis.\n\nWilliams, who is on the bargaining team for CPS support staff, wants to see the school keep health care costs low and implement a \"transformative wage structure.\"\n\n\"We want to be able to provide for our families, and maybe take our kids out to the movies,\" Williams said. \"We take care of the most vulnerable kids in the city of Chicago, and we should be compensated fairly.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re not looking to harm anybody. We\u2019re looking to lift our members out of poverty,\" said Dian Palmer, SEIU Local 73 President. \"I\u2019m always hopeful of the city coming around.\"\n\nCPS did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the status of negotiations with SEIU.\n\nJonathan Williams and his daughter, Kennedy, demonstrate outside Christopher Elementary School in Chicago in the early morning on Oct. 17, 2019.
