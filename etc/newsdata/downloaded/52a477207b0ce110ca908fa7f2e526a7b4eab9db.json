They said the larger rate cut would reduce the risks of a possible recession.\n\nBut a third group of \u201cseveral participants\u201d argued that the Fed should not be cutting rates at all, saying that the current outlook for the economy had changed little since the central bank\u2019s last meeting.\n\nThis rare three-way split on the Fed\u2019s top policy panel indicates that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell may face challenges in reaching consensus on future moves on rates.\n\nMany investors are hoping the Fed will cut rates for a third time this year when it meets again at the end of this month. The Fed\u2019s benchmark rate currently stands in a range of 1.75% to 2% with the next meeting coming on Oct. 29-30.\n\nThe CME Group, which tracks futures trading on the Fed\u2019s policy rate, is currently putting the chance of a third cut in October at around 84%.\n\nChris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, a global financial group, said, \u201cWe would bet that Powell will deliver the third rate cut the markets are clamoring for on Oct. 30 but rate cuts beyond this \u2026 start to look less like the insurance style cuts\u201d that Powell has referred to.\n\nMichael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said he found the minutes \u201cnoticeably ambivalent\u201d about the timing of the next cut. He said many Fed officials may be nearing the limits of how far they are comfortable cutting rates in the face of trade uncertainty and would prefer to \u201cwait instead for more concrete signs of weakness in the incoming data.\u201d\n\nThe September rate cut, which followed a cut in July that was the first in a decade, was approved on a 7-3 vote. Two Fed officials, Esther George, president of the Fed\u2019s Kansas City regional bank, and Eric Rosengren, president of the Boston bank, dissenting in favor of no cut.\n\nJames Bullard, president of the St. Louis regional bank, dissented in the other direction, arguing that the threats to the economy were large enough that a bigger cut was needed.\n\nThe minutes however showed that there were other Fed officials who disagreed over the quarter-point rate cut although not strongly enough to dissent.\n\nFollowing custom, the Fed does not name the Fed officials cited in the minutes, which were released after the customary three-week delay following a meeting.\n\nThe minutes showed officials also discussed the turbulence in a short-term funding market called the repo market that occurred in the week the central bank was meeting.\n\nIn remarks this week, Powell has said the Fed will be taking moves to deal with this turbulence.\n\nThe minutes showed that among the options discussed would be to allow the Fed\u2019s balance sheet to grow again. The Fed had been reducing its holdings that had surged to a peak of $4.5 trillion in the wake of the Great Recession as it engaged in several rounds of bond purchases aimed at lowering long-term rates and giving the economy a boost.\n\nThose bond purchases were known as \u201cquantitative easing.\u201d Powell said that while various options were being weighed for providing more stability for the short-term funding markets, the effort should not be considered a new round of quantitative easing.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal Reserve officials were sharply divided last month when they decided to cut their key policy rate for a second time this year, a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/09/5187aa_federal-reserve-minutes-92553-jerome-powell-in-oct-2019-file-photo-federal-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
