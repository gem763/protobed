Experts weigh in", "language": "en", "text": "The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board (WSJ) recently suggested that the Obama administration pulled off \u201cthe biggest accounting fraud in history\u201d with student loans when eliminating the role of private lenders in the federal student lending market.\n\nExperts who spoke with Yahoo Finance acknowledged the issue with the general policy in hindsight, though they disagreed on who exactly is to blame.\n\nIn 2010, Democrats \u201cnationalized the market to help pay for Obama Care,\u201d WSJ asserted. \u201cThe Congressional Budget Office at the time forecast that eliminating private lenders would save taxpayers $58 billion over 10 years. This estimate was pure fantasy, and now we\u2019re seeing how much.\u201d\n\nThe WSJ op-ed also highlighted the rising number of severely delinquent student loans since then and blamed the Obama administration for expanding plans in 2012 for new borrowers \u201cto reduce defaults, buy off millennial voters and disguise the cost of its student-loan takeover.\u201d\n\nThe editorial board then added: \u201cThis may be the biggest accounting fraud in history.\u201d\n\nFormer President of the United States of America Barack Obama discusses democracy with students at Church Congress on May 25, 2017 in Berlin, Germany.

Bush administration and currently president of the center-right American Action Forum, agreed that the accounting discrepancy manifested because of the \u201ctechnique\u201d used by the CBO to evaluate the cost of these loan programs.\n\n\u201cA widely known deficiency of the Federal Credit and Reform Act is that it does not allow the CBO to incorporate [market risk] into assessments,\" Holtz-Eakin told Yahoo Finance. \u201cSo the loans, when they're evaluated are evaluated as safer than they truly are, and thus, the losses are smaller than they may truly be. And there's no way around that \u2014 the techniques force you to do that.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cthat's why when you when they switched from the private loans to the government loans, it appeared to save money... that is misleading. I don't disagree, but it's not the CBO's fault \u2014 those are the rules.\u201d\n\nSheila Bair, the chair of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) from 2006 to 2011, agreed that the WSJ was \u201cright to call out the government\u201d on the accounting issue and stressed that it is \u201ca huge problem with federal budgeting and transparency generally.\u201d\n\n(Source: New York Fed) More\n\nIncome-based repayment plans were \u2018poorly designed\u2019\n\nThe WSJ argued that the key catalyst for the student debt crisis today \u2014 $1.48 trillion student loans outstanding, with 35% of the consumer loans in the \u201cseverely derogatory\u201d category \u2014 was a result of the Obama administration\u2019s policies regarding income-driven repayment (IDR) plans.\n\nIDR plans allow borrowers to cap monthly student loan payments based on how much money they are making at a given time. As of September 2018, \u201calmost half of the $898 billion in outstanding federal Direct Loans [were] being repaid by borrowers using IDR plans,\u201d according to the Government Accountability Office.", "description": "The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board (WSJ) recently suggested that the Obama administration pulled off \u201cthe biggest accounting fraud in history\u201d with student loans.", "authors": ["Aarthi Swaminathan", "Finance Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pO1XN4rTqH..iZE9z7p1Yw--~B/aD0xNDA4O3c9MjEzMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/83217100-cfe8-11e9-bf7f-8c7017fd3786", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
