Sign up here.\n\nTom Steyer was the only billionaire on stage during Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate, and the moderators used it to launch a discussion about how he and his rivals would tackle income inequality.\n\n\n\nBut it was the plan\u2014and the answer\u2014of Sen Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) that sparked debate on the topic, by taunting the other candidates whose own plans to tax the wealthiest Americans aren\u2019t as far-reaching as hers.\n\n\u201cMy question is not, \u2018Why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax?\u2019\u201d Warren said, vocalizing support for her proposal to levy a two-cent tax on the accumulated wealth of people with more than $50 million. \u201cIt's, \u2018Why is it, does everyone else on this stage, think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?\u201d\n\n\n\nWarren has said that her wealth tax will pay for a universal pre-k program, investments in historically black colleges and universities, and raising the wages of child care workers.\n\nThe line landed Warren one of her loudest rounds of applause of the night, but it didn\u2019t play well with her colleagues in the Senate. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who took Tuesday\u2019s debate as an opportunity to roundly jab Warren every chance she got, swiftly fired back.\n\n\u201cI want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires,\u201d Klobuchar said, referring to Steyer, who has previously called for a one percent tax on those worth more than $20 million. \u201cWe just have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar has previously said she would support removing Bush-era tax cuts for families making more than $250,000 annually, though that proposal would not address a family\u2019s accumulated wealth, as Warren\u2019s plan does.\n\n\n\n\u201cTaxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way taxing wealth does,\u201d Warren responded. \u201cThe rich are not like you and me. The really, really billionaires [sic] are making their money off their accumulated wealth, and it just keeps growing. We need a wealth tax in order to make investments in the next generation.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden had a garbled explanation for his own proposal to reduce income inequality. After suggesting that the government hike taxes on the sale of assets like stocks and bonds, he said, \u201cBecause guess what, why in God's name should someone who's clipping coupons in the stock market make, in fact\u2014pay a lower tax rate than someone who in fact is, like I said, the a school teacher and a firefighter. It's ridiculous and they pay a lower tax.\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen.
