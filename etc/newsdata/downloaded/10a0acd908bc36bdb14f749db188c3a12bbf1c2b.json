Retail sales in the city have slumped and tourists are staying away, and the impact of the skirmish on Hong Kong's economy has prompted some economists to warn of a recession.\n\nNow, the financial industry, part of the bedrock of the city's economy, has shown some early signs of discomfort.\n\nWhether it's putting work trips on hold, cancelling events, or more people in the financial industry in Hong Kong looking to transfer out, it seems jitters about the protests, which began to pick up steam in June, have begun to seep into the high-rise office buildings.\n\nOne banker who declined to be named said Singapore clients at one bank cancelled business trips to Hong Kong, opting to do video calls instead.

She did not cite specific businesses.\n\n\"I think it is a combination of uncertainty as far as the world and China, and on top of this all the protests,\" Branthover said. \"The atmosphere is people thinking about leaving, and people not investing in the area.\"\n\nBranthover said one recent senior placement she made at a bank in Hong Kong was let go after the firm announced plans to shift business out of Hong Kong.\n\nOne banker told Business Insider that private banks have been getting more inquiries from clients about moving accounts from Hong Kong to Singapore, a trend that has accelerated in step with mounting data security concerns about China's potential access to sensitive information.\n\nMeanwhile, events planned in the city have been put on hold, or outright cancelled.

A second recruiter that declined to be named said they've already come across a handful of people at banks and hedge funds looking to leave. The source said the reason all were looking to relocate was specifically related to the protests.\n\n\"People have learned from the past \u2014 when they were surprised or waited thinking things were going to be ok \u2014people have learned don't do that,\" Branthover said. \"People have really learned if there is something that is uncertain, make sure your job is certain.\"\n\nTo be sure, one other Hong Kong-based financial professional said they've noticed very little disruption to their day to day activities.\n\nBut Aaron Hantman, CEO at outsourced trading firm Tourmaline Partners, told Business Insider that recently, when hiring for open trader positions in his firm's Sydney office, he saw an influx of Hong Kong applications.\n\n\"We have seen a notable increase in interest from candidates currently living in Hong Kong and looking to leave,\" Hantman said. \"Although very early on, this could be an indication of longer lasting impact on Hong Kong as a financial center.\"", "description": "Three straight months of protests in Hong Kong have given some in the financial community pause about dealing with Asia's financial hub.", "authors": ["Dan Defrancesco", "Trista Kelley"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d83df972e22af36b6300c63-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
