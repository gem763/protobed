After all, if you know what works with your skin when it's causing a fuss and you're happy with it, then there's no need to add a new product into the mixture. If, however, you're on the lookout for a cream that will work with your skin even when it's at its most angry-looking or parched, then you might want to consider giving the Intensive Moisturising Cream a go.\n\nDesigned for use on the body (especially hands, feet, elbows and knees) and for dry to very dry skin, the cream sinks in upon application fairly quickly, and leaves you feeling soft without that lingering sticky feeling that some moisturising creams have. There's really very little fragrance to the product, and it promises to be paraben free - which is great news for people who are sensitive to scents and eczema sufferers.\n\nDid I love the Cetaphil Intensive Moisturising Cream? No, but I didn't hate it either. Would I repurchase? Probably not as a daily body moisturiser; only because I've already got moisturisers I know work well for me. But it'll probably be the first product I reach for in the event of an eczema flare-up, or during the harshest and coldest of winter months.\n\nPrice: HK$124.9 citywide", "description": "If you want a cream that will work with your skin even when it's at its most angry-looking or parched, then you might want to consider giving the Intensive Moisturising Cream a go.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/intensivemoisturizingcream85g.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
