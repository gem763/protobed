REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Files\n\nAs the greenback gave ground to major currencies, the biggest gainer was the Australian dollar AUD=D3, which jumped 0.4% from the session's low after jobs data showed buoyant hiring, lowering chances of monetary easing in November.\n\nSterling GBP= edged higher to $1.2828 after swinging about a five-month high overnight, knocked around by a series of mixed headlines on the likelihood of progress at an EU leaders summit in Brussels later on Thursday.\n\nIt has surged some 5% since last week as negotiations stepped up.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re all grateful that we might be coming to some sort of an end to the recent saga,\u201d said Nick Twidale, director of Sydney-based trade finance provider Xchainge.\n\n\u201cAnything that isn\u2019t a hard Brexit is going to be positive for the sterling,\u201d he said, adding a deal or something close to one could push the pound to $1.3500 or above.\n\nFailure could drop it below $1.2200, Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Richard Grace said in a note.\n\nThe U.S. dollar, meanwhile, had dropped on Wednesday as U.S. retail sales fell for the first time in seven months, painting a gloomy picture of the economy.\n\nIt drifted 0.1% weaker against the euro EUR= to $1.1083 and was steady against the Japanese yen JPY= at 108.76. Against a basket of currencies .DXY the dollar hit a month low of 97.898 overnight and was steady around that level on Thursday.\n\nThe Aussie AUD=D3 jumped to $0.6786 after figures showed joblessness unexpectedly contracting a bit last month, taking some pressure off the central bank to further reduce interest rates in November.\n\n\u201cThis is just what the doctor ordered,\u201d said CBA Chief Economist Craig James.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason for the Reserve Bank to cut rates again in November \u2013 giving the central bank more time to gauge the effectiveness of early rate reductions.\u201d\n\nLingering worries about trade tensions between the United States and China kept a lid on gains for trade-exposed currencies.\n\nReports of a partial trade deal between the world\u2019s two largest economies last week initially cheered markets, but a lack of details on the agreement has since curbed enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cEven if a deal is signed, it remains uncertain if the obligations can be fully met on both sides,\u201d strategists at Singapore\u2019s DBS Bank said in a note.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar NZD=D3 was lower, following dovish comments from a top central banker on Wednesday, and sits at $0.6287, not far from a four-year low hit two weeks ago.\n\nChina's yuan CNY= weakened slightly to 7.0975 per dollar.", "description": "The dollar drifted lower on Thursday after lacklustre U.S. retail data and gathering doubts about a Sino-U.S. trade deal, while the volatile pound was on edge as Britain and the European Union scrambled to secure a last-minute Brexit deal.", "authors": ["Tom Westbrook", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441696426&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G004", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
