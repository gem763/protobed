They began the night five games behind the second wild card.\n\n\u201cI think first and foremost we still have odds, right, and we know that,\u201d Hoskins said. \u201cSure, we know they may be long and we still may have some work to do, but we\u2019re still in it.\u201d\n\nPhillies manager Gabe Kapler said he doesn\u2019t want his players to focus on the standings.\n\n\u201cWe know where we are in the standings,\u201d Kapler said. \u201cWe know what the numbers say, but it\u2019s not what we\u2019re paying attention to right now. We\u2019re paying attention to fighting for each other down the finish line.\u201d\n\nThe Phillies\u2018 bullpen almost blew a 5-2 lead.\n\nAdeiny Hechavarr\u00eda\u2019s pinch-hit homer off Jos\u00e9 Alvarez in the eighth cut Philadelphia\u2019s lead to two runs. Adam Duvall led off the ninth with a homer off Phillies closer H\u00e9ctor Neris, cutting the lead to one.\n\nNeris walked Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr., who stole second and moved to third on Ozzie Albies\u2019 groundout to Hoskins at first. Neris walked Freddie Freeman before striking out Josh Donaldson on a called third strike. Neris earned his 27th save when Nick Markakis popped out to end the game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happened so much here that you expect it,\u201d Braves manager Brian Snitker said of the ninth-inning comeback attempt. \u201cThey always put themselves in position to win. \u2026 It\u2019s a good trait to have.\u201d\n\nThe Braves still need a combination of three wins and Washington losses to clinch the division.\n\nVince Velasquez (7-7) gave up two runs in the first before recovering with four straight scoreless innings for his first career win over the Braves. The right-hander allowed five hits in five innings.\n\nKeuchel\u2019s streak of five straight wins ended when he gave up five runs in five innings. Keuchel (8-6) allowed a combined four earned runs in his winning streak but topped that total in the fourth.\n\nThe Phillies\u2018 big inning began when Braves third baseman Donaldson bobbled Bryce Harper\u2019s grounder after cutting in front of shortstop Dansby Swanson in an attempt to field the ball. Hoskins followed Harper\u2019s infield hit with his 29th homer to right field.\n\nPirela\u2019s first homer, off the facing of the second deck in left field, drove in Sean Rodr\u00edguez, who singled. C\u00e9sar Hern\u00e1ndez drove in Scott Kingery, who reached on an infield hit.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nBraves: OF Ender Inciarte (right hamstring strain) worked on outfield drills before batting practice but is \u201cstill a ways away\u201d from game action, according to Snitker. Inciarte has been out since Aug. 17. \u2026 IF Charlie Culberson, already declared out for the season, was placed on the 60-day injured list when the team recalled C John Ryan Murphy from Triple-A Gwinnett. Culberson suffered multiple broken facial bones when he was hit in the face by a pitch from Washington\u2019s Fernando Rodney on Saturday. He will not require surgery.\n\nPhillies: OF Corey Dickerson was placed on the 60-day IL with a broken bone in his left foot. Kapler said a follow-up test revealed the fracture after initial X-rays were negative. Dickerson had not played since Sept. 11. RHP Edubray Ramos (right shoulder impingement) was reinstated from the 60-day IL.\n\nBRAVES HOMER RECORD\n\nHechavarr\u00eda\u2019s homer was the Braves\u2018 franchise-record 236th of the season. Duvall\u2019s homer pushed the record to 237. Atlanta hit 235 homers in 2003.\n\nKEUCHEL\u2019S REGRET\n\nKeuchel bemoaned his inability to get out of the fourth with no more damage after giving up Hoskins\u2019 homer. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been so good at, limiting the damage,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that tonight.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPhillies: RHP Zach Eflin (8-12, 4.20) is 0-3 with an 11.57 ERA while lasting only a combined 9 1/3 innings in three starts against Atlanta this season.\n\nBraves: RHP Julio Teheran (10-9, 3.50) will try for his first win of the season against the Phillies. He is 0-2 with an 8.00 ERA in two starts against the Phillies this year.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Rhys Hoskins and the Philadelphia Phillies haven't given up on their NL wild card hopes.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Charles Odum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/phillies_braves_baseball_89650_c0-84-2006-1253_s1770x1032.jpg?d428b774fe78106b5d3f859509636163f175cafe", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
