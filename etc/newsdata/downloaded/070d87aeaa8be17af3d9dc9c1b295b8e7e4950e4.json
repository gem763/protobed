That, though, was certainly not a reference to fine footwork and Mick McCarthy\u2019s side had little cause for a jig after this goalless and soulless draw.\n\nIt was their worst performance yet under McCarthy and bore all the hallmarks of the latter days of Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s reign - a display void of energy and imagination. The effervescent Flatley it most definitely was not. Flat, more like.\n\nMcCarthy kept Brighton forward Aaron Connolly on the bench until deep into the second half and the 19-year-old debutant - scorer of two goals versus Spurs last weekend - provided a belated attacking threat. It was, on reflection, mystifying that he did not start.\n\nRepublic of Ireland full-back Seamus Coleman challenges Georgia's Valeri Qazaishvili\n\nAaron Connolly looks dejected after missing a late chance on his full international debut\n\nMATCH FACTS Georgia: Loria, Kakabadze, Kashia, Tabidze, Grigalava, Kankava, Kiteishvili (Aburjania 90), Okriashvili (Lobjanidze 79), Ananidze, Qazaishvili, Kvilitaia (Shengelia 73) Subs not used: Khocholava, Kvirkvelia, Daushvili, Makaridze, Kupatadze, Kharaishvili, Navalovski, Lobzhanidze Bookings: Grigalava Goals: None Ireland: Randolph, Coleman, Duffy, Egan, Doherty, Whelan, Hourihane (Williams 90+3), Robinson (Browne 73), Hendrick, McClean, Collins (Connolly 79) Subs not used: O'Hara, Maguire, Hogan, Byrne, Travers, O'Dowda, Judge, Cullen, Long Bookings: Whelan Goals: None Referee: Marco Guida\n\nBut Ireland, in truth, did not deserve to emerge with anything other than the point which means they will probably have to beat one of Switzerland or Denmark in their two remaining fixtures if they are to progress automatically to Euro 2020.\n\nThe conditions did not aid the aesthetics of the football, a fierce wind whipping around the Dinamo Stadium bowl. But Typhoon Hagibis it was not and Ireland have played just as poorly in far more serene surrounds.\n\nIt took just 25 seconds for Georgia to penetrate Ireland\u2019s backline and they would have been in front had Valeri Qazaishvili not sliced wide when in need of more composure 12 yards out.\n\nAll of the major incident from an otherwise drab first half came within four minutes of kick-off and, at the other end, John Egan glanced his header against the post having connected with Conor Hourihane\u2019s whipped free-kick.\n\nThereafter, Ireland were absent of inspiration. The sight of James McClean and James Collins tackling each other on the touchline and conceding a throw-in just about summed up their half.\n\nLuton Town striker James Collins is hauled to the turf by Georgia defender Guram Kashia\n\nSet-pieces were always going to be their most likely avenue of joy but so poor were those deliveries that Georgia nearly scored from one Ireland corner when they broke and Jano Ananidze dragged wide.\n\nLuton striker Collins was making his first start for his country but the targetman was not proving much of a target at all and very little stuck in the final third.\n\nIt left Ireland exposed to Georgian counters and, but for the intervention of Seamus Coleman with one far-post interception early in the second half, they would have trailed as Ananidze looked to steal in.\n\nSheffield United forward Callum Robinson battles for the ball with jimmy Tabidze\n\nHaving spoken bullishly of coming here to win, McCarthy would have been forgiven for downgrading his expectations as the hour mark passed with Georgia in control.\n\nIt was crying out for a change but McCarthy did not act until the 73rd minute, and even then he kept Connolly on the bench behind him and introduced midfielder Alan Browne with the ineffective Callum Robinson making way.\n\nFinally, with 12 minutes remaining, Connolly replaced Collins, another who had failed to impact.\n\nRepublic and Ireland fans congregate in one corner of the Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena\n\nAnd the teenager drew the first save of the night from Giorgi Loria when pouncing on a loose ball in stoppage time and firing into the grasp of the goalkeeper.\n\nConnolly then burst clear in the inside left channel but located the side of the netting rather than the back of it with a snap shot from 14 yards.\n\nIt was evidence enough, however, of the trouble his pace could have caused the hosts had he been on the pitch from the start.\n\nMcCarthy could well come to regret that decision.", "description": "CRAIG HOPE IN TBILISI: Ireland were compared to Lord of the Dance's Michael Flatley by Georgia's coach on the eve of the game.
