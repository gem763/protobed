Wealth inequality, in other words, is an anti-democratic force. A remarkable study by Lee Drutman found that just 31,385 people \u2014 one ten-thousandth of the population \u2014 accounted for more than a quarter of all political donations in the 2012 campaign cycle, with politicians getting more money from fewer people than in any other year analyzed. No wonder low-income households\u2019 policy preferences have little effect on political outcomes in the United States, whereas high-income households\u2019 policy preferences do, as research by Martin Gilens of Princeton University and Benjamin Page of Northwestern forcefully shows. One of those political outcomes? Inequality itself: Unequal societies tend not to correct their own inequality, because of the political influence of the rich.\n\nAnnie Lowrey: Curse of the cult of the founder\n\nThe country\u2019s inequality is also stifling mobility and damaging the country\u2019s human capital. As the country has become more unequal, it has also become more sclerotic and class-dominated. Despite all the money the government spends on public education, private education, health, and welfare, rich kids are likely to stay rich and poor kids are likely to stay poor. Measures of absolute mobility have fallen: Children born in 1940 had a 90 percent chance of doing better than their parents did, whereas children born in the 1980s had just a 50 percent chance of the same. The steps of the income ladder are too far apart for kids to climb them, in other words. Safe neighborhoods, quality education, and security at home are out of reach for too many children. Inequality is now driving a longevity gap, an educational-attainment gap, and a health gap. It lurks behind the country\u2019s falling entrepreneurship rate, too. The country will not prosper through growth alone, but only through sharing its prosperity more widely.\n\nInequality, finally, is likely affecting growth\u2014in no small part because it is affecting the country\u2019s human capital, making it hard for would-be entrepreneurs and scientific geniuses and business leaders who happen to be born towards the bottom of the income scale to fulfill their potential. If the rich have all the money, there is less spending throughout the whole of the economy and fewer opportunities for businesses to pursue. Given those dynamics, one study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found that rising inequality slashed five percentage points from the United States\u2019 GDP per capita between 1990 and 2010.\n\nGiven all this evidence, wealth taxes are not simply a way to pay for programs for the poor. They are a way of reducing the incentive for the rich to soak up all that money in the first place. They are a way of pushing the steps of the income ladder closer together to make them easier to climb. They are a way of ending what two leading economists on inequality, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, call \u201coligarchic drift,\u201d and its attending political risks. They are a way of building a healthier economic future for everyone\u2014including those 400 families up at the tippy top.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
