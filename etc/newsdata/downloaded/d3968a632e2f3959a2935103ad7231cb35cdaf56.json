She said \u201ca lot of people died\u201d and that she started praying when her home collapsed in the hurricane.\n\nOther survivors, some with no more than the clothes they escaped in, also arrived in Florida at the weekend on a cruise ship that went to the islands\u2019 assistance.\n\nMeanwhile, emergency officials in the Bahamas said they have had to \u201cclamp down\u201d on aircraft demanding payment for evacuating displaced people from some of the areas devastated by Hurricane Dorian.\n\nThe Bahamian government\u2019s National Emergency Management Agency (Nema) said aviation authorities are aware of reports of \u201ccommercial activity\u201d and would revoke flight permission for any aircraft charging fees.\n\nThe agency said in a statement on Sunday that no flights are permitted to bill the authorities for evacuations and that consumer protection officials are investigating \u201cincidences of price gouging\u201d.\n\nA website started by a member of the public in the Bahamas for people unofficially to log missing persons has at least 6,500 names on it and, as of Sunday afternoon, while many have the status \u201cknown\u201d recorded next to the name, more names have \u201cunknown\u201d written next to them.\n\nCivil aviation authorities said they were restricting air space over the devastated Abaco and Grand Bahama islands to prevent accidents and ensure only approved aircraft that are providing aid can fly there.\n\nOfficials have authorized 200 private planes in the area and say \u201csaturated airspace was creating a volatile situation\u201d.\n\nPhillip Smith, the executive director of the Bahamas Feeding Network, a non-profit organisation, was organising the delivery of 20,000 meals to those most in need in Freeport, on Grand Bahama island.\n\n\u201cJust going into the communities here is tough. Seeing kids who haven\u2019t had a drink of water in quite a while, it\u2019s a confronting thing,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are fears that patchy remaining water supplies in the damaged areas will be contaminated and survivors are at risk from disease, also with dead bodies yet to be recovered.\n\nThe government is scrambling to find shelter for tens of thousands left homeless.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to get crazy soon,\u201d Serge Simon, a 39-year-old ice truck driver, told the Associated Press in Freeport on Friday as he waited with his wife and two sons, five months old and four. \u201cThere\u2019s no food, no water. There are bodies in the water.
