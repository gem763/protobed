I was at a joke 'end of the world' theme party - nobody thought Donald Trump would actually win. His victory sealed the deal and pushed me to run.\"\n\nBack then, Phillipe Cunningham, a transgender man of colour, was working as a policy advisor in the mayor's office in Minneapolis in America's Midwest. Trump's arrival in the White House was the tipping point that persuaded him to run for election to the city council there in 2017.\n\nAnd it seems he's not alone in being persuaded to take the plunge into politics in the wake of the 2016 presidential election. Across the US, there's been a rise in individuals from the LGBT community winning electoral office.\n\nIn 2018, this increase in representation was described as \"a rainbow wave\" by pro-LGBT leadership group, the Victory Institute. In a report published in June, it says the number of trans elected officials at state and local level has grown by almost 54% over the past year.\n\n\"More diversity in elected leadership is always a good thing, because it adds perspectives from people with different lived experiences. It makes for a more equal system,\" Phillipe, 32, tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\n\n\"I have lived my life for 23 years as a black woman and the last nine as a black man - I know what it's like to be marginalised.\"\n\nImage copyright Phillipe Cunningham Image caption Phillipe Cunningham is passionate about making an impact at a local level\n\nBreaking barriers\n\nAccording to the Victory Institute, there are currently 20 elected officials who identify as transgender, including Phillipe.\n\nNone of these, though, are at the highest level of state or national government - such as the US Congress or state senates.\n\nThere is a chance this could change, however, with Sarah McBride, a 29-year-old trans woman running to be a state senator in Delaware in 2020.\n\nIf she wins, she'd be America's first openly transgender state senator.\n\nSarah was an intern in the Obama White House - making her the first openly trans woman to work in the White House.\n\nShe already enjoys the support of prominent figures such as Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\nHe wrote the foreword to her memoir about her fight for trans equality and the death of her late husband, Andy - a trans man and fellow activist.\n\nImage copyright Friends of Sarah McBride Image caption Sarah McBride became the first trans person to speak at a major US party convention in 2016\n\n'Dismantling protections'\n\nThe Trump administration has been \"pretty thorough in attacking and dismantling pretty much all of the protections\" introduced under Obama, according to Sharita Gruberg - who oversees LGBT policy research at the liberal US think tank, Center for American Progress.\n\nFrom the military and education to healthcare and the workplace, the Trump administration has made some \"pretty significant attacks on trans people,\" says Sharita.\n\nA new rule banning certain transgender people from the military was allowed by the US Supreme Court in January - with legal challenges around this issue ongoing.\n\nIn 2017, President Trump tweeted that \"tremendous medical costs and disruption\" was the reason behind the trans ban.\n\nUnder Obama, the US government was prepared to pay the medical costs of transgender people serving in the military.\n\nA spokeswoman from the US Department of Defence said the military treats \"all transgender persons with respect and dignity\" and the new policy was \"based on professional military judgement\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption President Trump's policy of banning certain transgender people from the military has sparked protests\n\nRule changes have also been proposed for healthcare and the workplace - which would remove sex discrimination protections for trans people.\n\nThis means it would be harder for trans people to find proper healthcare and that employers could sack someone for being transgender.\n\nBut the Trump administration says its healthcare policy is intended to reduce costs and points to $3.6bn (\u00a32.9bn) it could save - which would be used to provide additional services.\n\nFighting back\n\n\"Members of the community want to fight back against the Trump administration,\" says Taylor Glickman, a 23-year-old trans man from Massachusetts.\n\nHe adds that the current atmosphere in the US makes it \"more important than ever\" for people from his community to feel represented.\n\nAlthough he currently has no plans to run for office himself, Taylor is acutely aware of the need for people in power to understand the challenges LGBT people come up against. For him, it really hit home when he faced difficulties getting his hormone injections.\n\nImage copyright Taylor Glickman Image caption Taylor is a second year master's student studying social work at Westfield State University\n\nThe first National Trans Visibility March is due to take place in Washington DC on 28 September, with attendance expected to be in the thousands.\n\nIt's a response to the \"blatant disrespect the president has shown\", Taylor claims.\n\nPhillipe thinks there's been a social shift which means more trans individuals feel able to openly run for office and fight back.\n\n\"We live in a time when it's more socially acceptable to show kindness to the LGBTQ community.\"\n\nMark Mellman, a columnist for US political newspaper The Hill, wrote in June that attitudes towards transgender people are improving, partly due to \"increased awareness of those we know and love having different kinds of gender identities\".\n\nHe adds that younger people have \"more liberal attitudes\" than previous generations, so the attitude shift is likely to intensify.\n\nBroken promises?\n\nDuring his election campaign, President Trump said he'd be an ally of the LGBT community and would \"do everything\" in his \"power to protect\" them.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump Thank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 14, 2016 Report\n\nEarlier this year, he also became the first Republican President to acknowledge Pride month:\n\nSkip Twitter post 2 by @realDonaldTrump As we celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation, let us also stand in solidarity with the many LGBT people who live in dozens of countries worldwide that punish, imprison, or even execute individuals.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2019 Report\n\nAnd in a speech to the UN this week, he expressed \"solidarity with LGBTQ people\".\n\nBut for Taylor, the government's actions make these empty words by President Trump.\n\n\"I don't trust a single word that comes out of his or his administration's mouth.\n\n\"Quite frankly, him being an ally to the transgender community is not a thing I ever expected to happen.\"\n\n'An epidemic of violence'\n\nPhillipe says one of the \"top issues\" that needs to be tackled on a national level is attacks against trans women of colour.\n\nIn 2018, there were at least 26 deaths of transgender people in the US from fatal violence, the majority of who were women of colour, according to the Human Rights Campaign - America's largest civil rights organisation.\n\nThis year, the organisation has recorded 18 incidents of transgender people being killed.\n\nThe American Medical Association describes this as an \"epidemic of violence against the transgender community\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Violence against transgender women of colour is a cause for concern in the LGBT community\n\nAnd is running for office just about trans issues?\n\nNot for Phillipe, who says he wants to improve life in Minneapolis for everyone.\n\n\"I'm focused on poverty and making sure all of my constituents are safe from gun violence.\"\n\nHe adds that he's motivated by the idea of building a better, more equal, future.\n\n\"I am constantly meeting parents of trans kids who want their kids to be reflected in their government.\n\n\"We're changing the course of history.\"\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "\"I know what it's like to be marginalised\" - the first National Trans Visibility March is on Saturday.", "authors": ["Manish Pandey", "Newsbeat Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7505/production/_108975992_1925305a-b92e-4333-a45d-2874f0574d29.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
