'[Thunberg] is such an amazing young girl, and so brave and courageous to stand up to these grown-ups that can be very scary and for her to be so open and honest is exactly what we need.'\n\nMother-of-three Kim regularly takes private jets when she travels for both work and pleasure - once even infamously taking over an entire private Boeing 747 for a 'long flight' with husband Kanye West and a handful of employees.\n\nBy contrast Greta spent two weeks sailing across the Atlantic from England to New York for the UN conference. The schoolgirl deliberately avoids airplanes, one of the worst causes of carbon emissions.\n\nUnlikely environmentalist: Despite her love for private jets, Kim claims to do her bit to stop climate change, including recycling and choosing compostable trash bags\n\nMaking changes: Kim said she was raising her four children to care about the world\n\n'Climate change is a serious problem,' said Kardashian, who was attending the World Congress on Information Technology (WCIT) in the Armenian capital Yerevan.\n\nKim said she was raising her four children to care about the world around them.\n\n'My kids are extremely cautious. We took out all the plastic in our home, and we make specific decisions that are based on the environment. Just even to teach them, like, why are all of the plastic containers in our home and our pantry gone and its now all glass. And how do we recycle.'\n\nShe said she also wanted to talk to Thunberg's parents to understand how they support the teen, and how they have helped Greta navigate social media.\n\n'I would really love to speak to her parents and to see how they've encouraged her. Did she always have that in her?'\n\n'Speaking on a big platform invites a lot of different opinions and personalities and how they [Greta's parents] manage that.'\n\nSpeaking up: 'Climate change is a serious problem,' said Kardashian, who was attending the World Congress on Information Technology in the Armenian capital Yerevan on Monday; she is seen here on Tuesday, visiting the Tsitsernakaberd Armenian Genocide Memorial Complex\n\nKim said that all members of her family were very cautious about the environment and she defended other famous people like Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, who have been criticized for using private jets.\n\nThey were 'very passionate about decisions that change the world,' Kardashian said of the royal couple.\n\n'I still love and value the fact that they bring such attention to such important movements that need to happen and they are really passionate about, because they are still changing the world,' she said.\n\nPrivate jets: Greta would surely not approve of Kim's love of private jets; here the reality star flies with her children in March of this year\n\nConsumer: Kim and daughter North are seen on a private jet, surrounded by the trappings of their consumer-focused celebrity lifestyle, in July\n\nIs that an ad? Kim even promoted a private plane charter company back in 2017\n\nMother-of-three Kim regularly takes private jets when she travels for both work and pleasure - once even infamously taking over an entire private Boeing 747 for a 'long flight' with husband Kanye West and a handful of his employees\n\nCarbon footprint: Kanye on the private Boeing 747 in November last year\n\nKardashian, who has over 60 million followers on Twitter, said she was very determined to complete her studies as a lawyer, although it was 'challenging for her' due to her tight schedule.\n\nShe wants to promote the hiring of ex-prisoners so they are able to return to the workforce.\n\n'Some of the (most) enlightened people I've ever met, smartest people, people that know law the best, are people that are spending time in prison,' said Kardashian, who in the past has talked about her vocal support for criminal justice reform.\n\nThe reality-star-turned-activist said she had no plans to enter politics and does not want to have any more children with her musician husband Kanye West.", "description": "While she isn't the most obvious environmentalist, and regularly flies on private jets, the reality star claims she's a big supporter of 'brave and amazing' teen climate activist Greta Thunberg.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/21/19461584-0-image-a-81_1570567372640.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
