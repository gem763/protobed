By opening up to Raffy (Olivia Deeble) about her own epilepsy, she\u2019s managed to inspire the Morgan teen to get on top of her management of the condition.\n\nBut Raffy isn\u2019t the only Morgan Alex has been spending time with. After signing up at the gym and getting to know Willow (Sarah Roberts), she has also crossed paths with Mason (Orpheus Pledger). His name gets mentioned again when Raffy opens up to Alex about her epilepsy following a severe seizure, saying she\u2019s tried everything to keep them from happening.\n\nWhen Alex suggests keeping a journal to identify symptoms, Raffy tells her that\u2019s what Mason made her to do on their home CBD trial. Alex gets Raffy to backtrack when she hears this, forcing her to talk about how Mason ran an illegal medical trial, but the oil is the only thing which actually helped her.\n\nAlex is surprised to learn Mason is a doctor (Picture: Seven)\n\nAlex says that if she had things her way, CBD would be legal, and also wonders why Mason is working at Summer Bay Fit if he trained to be a doctor. Later, she checks in with Mason about Raffy, and asks about his internship plans. When he says he will be going to Western Australia as he wasn\u2019t offered a place locally, Alex is left with a lot to consider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter spending some time at the hospital, Alex returns to Mason and says she\u2019s put in a good word for him at Northern Districts. She\u2019s hoping to get him an interview so he can move him closer to home. Surprised and happy, Mason starts to see her in a new light\u2026\n\nMORE: Home and Away spoilers: Karen asks Maggie if she can sleep with Ben\n\nMORE: Home and Away spoilers: Robbo attacks Dr Alex in terrifying scenes\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "After Dr Alex offers to help Mason, he starts developing feelings for her.", "authors": ["Imogen Groome"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-07-at-00.33.45-c531_1570449263.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
