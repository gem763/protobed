Omar Bayless had six receptions for 149 yards, including a 71-yard catch and run for a touchdown, and Ryan Graham ran for 103 yards and a score on 12 carries for Arkansas State (1-1).\n\nOn the third play from scrimmage, Jeremy Smith picked off a pass from Armani Rogers and returned it 35 yards for a touchdown and, after UNLV went three-and-out, Blake Grupe\u2019s 26-yard field goal gave Arkansas State a 10-0 lead with 4:40 left in the first quarter.\n\nThe Rebels answered with a 16-play, 64-yard drive but had to settle for a 27-yard field goal by Daniel Guttierez but Arkansas State scored the next 23 points, capped by Kirk Merritt\u2019s 37-yard TD catch, to take a 30-3 lead with 12:30 left in the third quarter.\n\nCharles Williams had 168 yards rushing and a score on 19 carries for UNLV (1-1).
