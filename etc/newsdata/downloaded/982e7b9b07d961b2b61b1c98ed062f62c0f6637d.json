Wade, specifically by disregarding whether the fetus is viable at the time of the abortion.\n\nIn the majority opinion, Judges Bernice Bouie Donald, an Obama appointee, and R. Guy Cole, a Clinton appointee, affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling and noted the state\u2019s argument that the decision in Roe v. Wade \u201cexpressly rejected the claim that the right to abortion is \u2018absolute\u2019 and therefore entitles a woman to obtain an abortion \u2018for whatever reasons she alone chooses.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe state said the intention of Ohio\u2019s law was to prevent discrimination against children with a disability; hence, its name is the Antidiscrimination Law.\n\nThe judges said, however, that 20 years later in Planned Parenthood v. Casey the Supreme Court upheld Roe, affirming that \u201c[t]he woman\u2019s right to terminate her pregnancy before viability is the most central principle of Roe v. Wade.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a rule of law and a component of liberty we cannot renounce,\u201d the judges said.\n\nSenior Judge Alice Batchelder, a George H.W. Bush appointee, dissented, however. She affirmed the state\u2019s interest in fighting discrimination against those with disabilities.\n\nBatchelder also cited Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 statement that an abortion law in Indiana \u201cand other laws like it promote a State\u2019s compelling interest in preventing abortion from becoming a tool of modern-day eugenics.\u201d\n\nBatchelder continued:\n\nOhio enacted the Antidiscrimination Law, H.B. 214, to counteract such eugenicist practices concerning the prenatal Down Syndrome population. The law prevents a physician from performing an abortion when the physician knows the abortion is sought not because the woman did not intend to become pregnant, but because the child in the woman\u2019s womb tested positive for Down Syndrome.\n\nIn 2017, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) signed the bill into law that prohibited abortion in the case of unborn babies with Down syndrome.\n\nThe following year, Judge Timothy Black, an Obama appointee, said, \u201cFederal law is crystal clear,\u201d and he struck down the law.\n\n\u201cIt violates the right to privacy of every woman in Ohio and is unconstitutional on its face,\u201d he stated.\n\nAccording to Cleveland.com, a spokesman for Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said the office would ask the full Sixth Circuit Appeals Court to hear the case.\n\nSusan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser expressed disappointment with the panel\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cDiscrimination abortions have no place in any modern, inclusive society,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cOhio lawmakers acted on the will of the people in creating a safe haven for unborn children with Down syndrome, and two years later they are still fighting to implement the law.\u201d\n\nDannenfelser added that when the Supreme Court declined to review a similar Indiana law, the Court \u201cleft open the question of whether the Constitution allows states to protect unborn children from the eugenic practice of discrimination abortion and made clear they welcomed further consideration by the lower courts.\u201d\n\n\u201cUrgency is growing for the Supreme Court to weigh in on this question so these precious children can be protected from lethal discrimination,\u201d she said.", "description": "A federal appeals court panel affirmed a lower court's ruling that Ohio cannot ban abortion because of a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/young-boy-with-down-syndrome-stock-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
