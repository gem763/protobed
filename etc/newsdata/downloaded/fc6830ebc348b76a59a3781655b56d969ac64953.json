(AP) - Ian Book threw a career-high five touchdown passes and Notre Dame\u2019s defense came up with three first-half interceptions as the seventh-ranked Fighting Irish rolled past New Mexico 66-14 on Saturday in the final tuneup for a showdown at No. 3 Georgia.\n\nThe senior quarterback rebounded from a lackluster opening performance in a victory at Louisville to complete 15 of 24 passes for 360 yards. Book finished with another 46 yards rushing yards and a 1-yard TD. He sat the final 1\u00bd quarters.\n\n\u201cIt felt good getting the confidence up for everybody,\u201d Book said. \u201cTo come in here and get the win that we wanted felt really good. We\u2019ll enjoy it tonight and once tomorrow hits it\u2019s Georgia week and everyone knows that.\u201d\n\nBrian Kelly\u2019s Fighting Irish (2-0) had their way with the Lobos (1-1), who were without head coach Bob Davie. Saga Tuitele acted as head coach for Davie, the former Irish head coach from 1997-2001 who was hospitalized following New Mexico\u2019s opening victory Aug. 31 against Sam Houston State and did not make the trip.\n\nNotre Dame finished with 591 total yards to 363 by New Mexico, which got touchdown runs by Bryson Carroll (47 yards) and Bobby Cole (37). The Lobos outrushed the Irish 212-157.\n\n\u201cWhen you turn the ball over and give anybody a chance, it\u2019s going to be a tough uphill swing,\u201d Tuitele said. \u201cAgainst a good team like that, it could\u2019ve gotten uglier, but our kids fought our tails off. They didn\u2019t give in.\u201d\n\nThree of Book\u2019s \u201clong\u201d scoring passes were short throws that receivers turned into big plays. Avery Davis went 59 yards, Javon McKinley went 65 and Chris Finke had a 54-yarder. The touchdowns by Davis and Finke came on shovel passes while McKinley turned a 3-yard crossing pass into his score.\n\nMcKinley added another TD on a 20-yard scoring reception in the third quarter after Chase Claypool had a 37-yard TD reception in Notre Dame\u2019s 31-point second quarter.\n\nFreshman safety Kyle Hamilton opened the scoring with a 34-yard interception return for a touchdown. Notre Dame later got interceptions from Jalen Elliott and Shaun Crawford in the second quarter that the offense converted into touchdowns while taking a 38-7 halftime lead.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nNew Mexico: The Lobos struggled offensively in the first half, gaining just 80 yards on 35 plays in their seven possessions before going 75 yards on five plays, three of them rushes, the last being Carroll\u2019s 47-yard TD run. Starting quarterback Sheriron Jones, who was 4-of-15 passing for 19 yards with three interceptions in the first half, was replaced by sophomore Tekava Tuioti at the start of the second half.\n\nNotre Dame: The Irish were outgained 136-54 on the ground in the first half. Book threw for 251 yards and three touchdowns as offensive coordinator Chip Long had the Irish senior throwing from the start to build his confidence for next Saturday night\u2019s rumble between the hedges in Athens.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNew Mexico: The Lobos return home next Saturday afternoon to play New Mexico State in the Rio Grande Rivalry for the 110th time.\n\nNotre Dame: The Fighting Irish play Georgia for the third time, looking for their first victory.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ian Book threw a career-high five touchdown passes and Notre Dame's defense came up with three first-half interceptions as the seventh-ranked Fighting Irish rolled past New Mexico 66-14 on Saturday in the final tuneup for a showdown at No. 3 Georgia.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Fineran"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/new_mexico_notre_dame_football_09106_c0-176-4206-2628_s1770x1032.jpg?75bf4eab8b0f692aab80dc62509a0f1d3dfe65be", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
