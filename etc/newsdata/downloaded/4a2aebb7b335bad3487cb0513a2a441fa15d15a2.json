He said his victory should send a message nationwide that voters were rejecting the \u201cradical, liberal policies being pushed by today\u2019s Democratic Party\u201d.\n\nMr Trump attempted to take credit for the win, tweeting: \u201cDan Bishop was down 17 points 3 weeks ago. He then asked me for help, we changed his strategy together, and he ran a great race.\u201d\n\nBut no polling has emerged publicly that showed Mr Bishop with a deficit that big. Operatives from both parties and analysts had previously described the race as too close to call.\n\nThe win was a high point in a difficult few days for the president, who fired his national security adviser John Bolton after Afghanistan peace talks collapsed \u2013 Mr Bolton maintains he resigned \u2013 and a new opinion poll suggested his ratings were slipping amid fears of an economic recession.\n\nThe North Carolina results underscored the rural-urban split between the parties, with Mr Bishop running up substantial numbers in outlying areas and Mr McCready eroding GOP advantages in suburban regions.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

And it was only slightly greater than when then-GOP candidate Mark Harris seemed to win the seat over Mr McCready, 36, last year \u2013 before those results were annulled due to evidence of vote tampering.\n\nRepublicans have held the seat since 1963, and its loss would have been a worrisome preface to the party\u2019s presidential and congressional campaigns next year.\n\n\u201cI think it means Trump is going to get a second term, and Republicans will retake the majority,\u201d House minority leader Kevin McCarthy said. Many analysts think a GOP takeover will be difficult.\n\nA second Republican, Greg Murphy, also won a House seat on Tuesday in North Carolina\u2019s third congressional district.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Dan Bishop, the conservative Republican, has won the special election for US Congress in North Carolina\u2019s ninth district.
