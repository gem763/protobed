Less than two years later she was dragged back to trial with prosecutors demanding she be sentenced to 40 years for aggravated homicide. The now 21-year-old spent three years going through trials, jail and scrutiny, all while she was still recovering. In her first trial, Hernandez didn\u2019t use the sexual assault as defence out of fear of violent repercussion. It wasn\u2019t until she later received therapy that she would share this information.\n\nHernandez has since been acquitted and is now a free woman, with plans to go back to school. Her case is a win \u2013 albeit a long-awaited one \u2013 for El Salvador activists. She can now return to her old life.\n\nBut dozens of women are still serving decades-long sentences in El Salvador for miscarriages and stillbirths. Women continue to be handcuffed to hospital beds, still bleeding as they are arrested. There is a systemic fight targeting women in this Central American country \u2013 and local activists warn it is being perpetuated by the state.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

After fainting in an outhouse near her home in April 2016, her mother took her to the hospital, where doctors found she had given birth. The body of a baby was later found in a toilet septic tank and the teenager was arrested.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Forgotten Women: The ordinary lives of extraordinary people 1/13 Raped during the Kosovo war, a woman's life 20 years on Sihana was in a house full of women and children when she was raped by a member of the Serbian paramilitary. The men took five of the younger women into separate rooms; one of them had given birth just four days before. \u201cThey raped us until they\u2019d had enough. The children were screaming, the old women were screaming, we were screaming,\u201d Sihana says. The Kosovo war ended 20 years ago, but its effects are all too present for this young nation. Approximately 20,000 women and girls were raped during the 14-month conflict; thousands of people remain missing \u2013 both Albanian and Serbian \u2013 with multiple mass graves uncovered over the last two decades. Tom Ford 2/13 How a child bride left her abusive husband in the nation with the highest rate of underage marriage Hadiza was walking home from school one day when people started calling out: \u201cThe young bride! The young bride!\u201d The 14-year-old had no idea who they were talking about, and kept on walking. She returned home to find her mother crying but when Hadiza asked her sisters why their mother was so upset, no one answered. This would be the start of Hadiza\u2019s new life as a child bride. Every year 12 million girls are married before they turn 18. Niger has the highest prevalence of child brides, with 76 per cent of girls married by 18, and 28 per cent by 15 in the West African nation. In some regions, girls as young as 10 are married, and after the age of 25, very few women remain unmarried. Tom Ford 3/13 How women get into the sex industry - and how they get out of it Rachel Lloyd was forced to leave her school in England after her abusive, alcoholic stepfather drained her mother\u2019s finances then left the family. As an underage teen she was raped by an adult and battled with substance abuse. After moving to Germany, her boyfriend \u2013 who was a crack addict \u2013 eventually became her pimp. This is by no means an isolated tale. Studies show anywhere from 50 to 90 per cent of women who end up in the sex industry were sexually abused as children. Poverty is another driving force that sees women turn to prostitution. Although some people may choose to work in the sex industry, many are forced into it by circumstance. Tom Ford 4/13 How one woman escaped FGM and saved thousands more from the cut When she was eight, Nice Nailantei Leng\u2019ete ran away to avoid being cut. Along with her elder sister, she left her home in the early hours of the morning and hid. When their uncles found the girls, they beat them. \u201cWhen I was hiding in the trees I was thinking: 'Will they find me and force me to go through FGM? I saw death because of circumcision and I was worried that I might die, or if I did not die I would not be able to go back to school and I would be married.'\u201d Nice is from a Maasai community in Kilmana, Kenya, a nation where the practice has been prevalent for centuries. Tom Ford 5/13 Displaced women in Syria are fighting for change Seven years into a civil war that has left devastation in its wake, campaigns and aid are beginning to dry up in Syria. The suffering of those still facing untold hardships is fading from public view as the world moves on to the latest crisis. Thousands are still displaced, living with limited access to basic necessities such as food, electricity and fuel. Unknown numbers are detained or missing. Many of those left behind are women doing what they can to support their families, often mourning the loss of loved ones. Even though there are fewer battlefields, fighting continues, leaving civilians in mortal danger. The message from women in Syria rings clear: \u201cI want you to feel our suffering.\u201d Tom Ford 6/13 A woman's tale of gun violence and domestic abuse Gun violence in the United States has become so destructive and all-encompassing, Amnesty International have branded it a human rights crisis. Despite 80 per cent of all gun deaths in the world taking place in America and 30,000 adults and children dying every year in the nation, Congress has done little in recent years. With gun control a divisive issue that some fear to touch due to voter backlash and the right to bear arms enshrined in the second amendment, the government has been quiet. Zero gun control laws have been passed in Congress in the last three years. Tom Ford 7/13 The sisters fighting religious extremism in Pakistan Saba Ismail woke up in her Brooklyn home to a voicemail from her sister, Gulalai. She was calling to say she had been apprehended by Pakistan officials upon landing in Islamabad after a flight from London. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) told Gulalai she had been put on an exit control list (ECL) and was going to be immediately detained. \u201cThe space is shrinking and closing out spaces for civic voices, voices who are raising for peace,\u201d Gulalai says in the message recorded as she was being detained. Illustration by Tom Ford 8/13 The terrifying crisis of North America's murdered and missing indigenous women It is North America\u2019s dark, open secret that native women are far more likely to be raped, and far more likely to be murdered. No justice. That is the constant cry from friends and families of victims as countless cases are left unresolved and ignored. Marita Growing Thunder, a 19-year-old Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women (MMIW) activist from Montana, has experienced this lack of justice \u2013 five times. Tom Ford 9/13 Why violence in Zimbabwe is more than just political As with so many other countries, women and girls are constant targets for violence in Zimbabwe. Data from Zimbabwe National Statistics Office indicates sexual assault is on the rise. From 2010 to 2016 there was a 42 per cent increase in rape cases, with at least 21 people raped every day. Taking into account the fact that many don\u2019t report sexual violence, this figure is likely higher. Womankind Worldwide 10/13 How Rwanda rose to the top of the world for women's representation The only one of 14 siblings to survive, with four children of her own as well as nieces to look after, Vestine survived the Rwandan genocide. Unique conditions grew from the horror, leading Rwanda to become a female-led African nation. As Vestine says, \u201cOur genocide is not something that can be easily forgotten but we try to live with them and work with fellow citizens for the development of our nation. I can say that Rwanda has tremendously tried to rebuild itself. We remember our loved ones who perished during 1994 genocide against Tutsi as we rebuild ourselves. We have enough security in our nation and we are all working together to rebuild our nation. Specifically, women are rebuilding.\u201d With male bias dominating so many nations, Rwanda shows that not only can a country thrive and grow with proper gender representation, but that it can help a nation heal from the unimaginable. Illustrations by Tom Ford 11/13 Why women in South Africa are carrying the burden of HIV South Africa has the biggest HIV epidemic in the world, with 7.1 million people living with the virus. There is a huge gender disparity in infection rates, with nearly four times the number of young women infected than men their age. Not only are women disproportionately infected, but there is another burden tying them to this life-changing illness - childbirth. Many women have been unknowingly infected with HIV, then unknowingly passed it on to their children. Tom Ford 12/13 One Syrian mother's remarkable journey to find her son More than 500,000 people have died since the Syrian conflict began in 2011. With thousands of men imprisoned or killed at the hands of Isis and the Syrian army, many women are left behind fighting for survival, without even the solace of knowing whether their husbands and sons are dead or alive. Tom Ford 13/13 The fight against brutal land grabs in Uganda A 30-year-old mother with six children, Patience is doing everything she can to rebuild her life. Her husband, Isaac, died four years ago in a Ugandan land grab, which saw her family forcefully evicted so a sugar factory could be built on the land. \u201cOne day, we were at home and we heard screams. There was so much violence. Guns, teargas and machetes. If you delayed they burned down your house. I heard screams everywhere and I started running. They took our goats, cows, chickens and our whole home.\u201d WomanKind Worldwide 1/13 Raped during the Kosovo war, a woman's life 20 years on Sihana was in a house full of women and children when she was raped by a member of the Serbian paramilitary.

They took our goats, cows, chickens and our whole home.\u201d WomanKind Worldwide\n\nThe case \u201clegally doesn\u2019t make any sense\u201d, says Paula Avila Guillen, a human rights lawyer who has worked closely with Hernandez. \u201c[The prosecutor] recognised that Hernandez didn\u2019t do anything intentional and they just practically created a theory of a case of what it would be seen as negligence.\u201d After arguing that Hernandez, a teenager with no medical training, was negligent for not knowing how to respond to an obstetric emergency, prosecutors wanted to convict her of aggravated homicide.\n\nGuillen, who is also a director at the Women\u2019s Equality Centre, says this case is even more \u201coutrageous\u201d than similar instances in El Salvador. \u201cShe was already sentenced one time then appealed, and then she was released \u2026 but still the prosecutors took her to retrial; that just shows a level of malice to really use all the weight of the state to charge these women.\u201d\n\nIn cases such as Hernandez\u2019s the state is the prosecutor, bringing women to trial for their supposed crimes. \u201cIt is the attorney general wanting to use all its weight and power to criminalise women,\u201d Guillen says.\n\nHuman rights groups warn women are being sent to prison with little to no evidence of a crime. Maricela Albizuri, another woman charged with aggravated homicide, was almost immediately handcuffed to her bed after arriving at hospital following stillbirth in a bathroom. She was then given a gynaecological exam, for which police were present.\n\nFour days later she was taken to prison and detained for six months. It had a serious effect on her mental health.\n\n\u201cThe immediate detention and interrogation of a woman seeking urgent medical care in the wake of a traumatic incident, including the presence of police investigators during private examinations, implicates the basic rights to health and dignity,\u201d David Pressman, executive director of the Clooney Foundation for Justice, says. He adds: \u201cWhen charges are brought without evidence, it raises concerns about a state\u2019s compliance with international standards \u2026 and, in some cases, it can suggest an ulterior motive for the charging decision.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

With the fear of punishment hanging ahead of them, many women and girls are avoiding medical help, which can lead to long-term health problems. And it isn\u2019t just mothers that face prison. In El Salvador, the person assisting or facilitating birth or obstetric emergencies can also be prosecuted. \u201cHospitals are becoming crime scenes. And women cannot access abortion even to save their own lives\u201d, Guillen says.\n\nThere was little evidence differentiating Albizuri\u2019s stillbirth from any other, but prosecutors went ahead with charges, leaving her in prison for months before trial. \u201cIn the cases of Ms Hernandez and Ms Albizuri, based on our monitors\u2019 reports there was a significant lack of evidence brought forward during the judicial proceedings themselves. We were also deeply concerned by a number of aspects of the pre-trial investigation, which are likewise within the state\u2019s control,\u201d Pressman says.\n\nBoth women are now free due to the tireless work of activists, legal teams and global attention on their cases, but many aren\u2019t so fortunate. \u201cIt is impossible for things to get worse in El Salvador. There are still 50 women in prison serving sentences up to 30 years for miscarriages and stillbirths. That is the reality,\u201d Guillen says.\n\nLong before these cases reach a judge, the state works to put women with at-risk pregnancies behind bars. Alberto Romero, founding partner of the Citizen Group for the Decriminalisation of Abortion in El Salvador, says the situation is \u201cactive persecution of women\u201d. After the total criminalisation of abortion in 1998, the attorney general\u2019s office said all hospitals must report any suspicion of abortion. \u201cIf they did not, they would be accused of covering up or collaborating,\u201d Romero says.\n\nThese policies have a disproportionate impact on the least-privileged women. Roughly two-thirds of the women prosecuted are 25 or younger and in 72 per cent of cases the father is no longer present. \u201cIn other words, this penalising legislation only applies to young women of low educational level, with very low or no economic income and who live in situations of marginalisation and poverty and also face this situation alone without a partner,\u201d Romero says.\n\nDespite such difficult circumstances, women\u2019s movements are growing to battle the harsh, restrictive laws, as seen in the eventual acquittal of Hernandez and Albizuri. \u201cThere have been certain signs of change; a female MP in El Salvador has insisted on a change in the legislation. Women\u2019s movements have made progress in terms of organising themselves and reporting on women who have been incarcerated for abortions and miscarriages,\u201d Ada Zambrano, deputy regional director of Care International, says.\n\nWomen wrongly imprisoned for obstetric emergencies have been sharing their stories with the UN, drawing the world\u2019s attention to the human rights abuses they face. \u201cThere is nothing more powerful than to hear it in their own voices, from someone who spent 10 years in prison and to come out and share their own story,\u201d Guillen says. \u201cThat has really clicked with El Salvador and with society, to hear the stories of these women, and women who were separated from their child.\u201d\n\nNow a free woman, Hernandez \u201chas many goals for the future\u201d, according to her lawyer Elizabeth Deras. She plans to finish high school and study for a degree in computer science or English. Deras adds: \u201cShe\u2019s also told us that she wants to get a job to help her family and especially her mother.\u201d\n\nThis case could be the much-needed springboard for those still languishing behind bars, and potentially even change how women are prosecuted in the future. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt this case set a precedent, it has also provided us with jurisprudence for future cases to be known and to strengthen the defence arguments against judgments of women already convicted,\u201d Deras says.", "description": "After 33-months in prison for having a stillbirth as a result of rape, Evelyn Hernandez was released.
