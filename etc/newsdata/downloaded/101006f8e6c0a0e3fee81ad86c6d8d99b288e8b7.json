What\u2019s wrong with looking at a league table and wanting to be top of the pile?\n\nAnd a bit of discipline never did 14-year-olds any harm.\n\nMy PFA Academy All-Stars under-14 team plays in the Timperley and District junior league, and this season they introduced sin bins \u2013 primarily to cut out dissent.\n\nAs the manager, I\u2019ve told my players that if anyone is sin-binned for backchat to referees or officials, they will miss the next two games \u2013 with no promises that they will get back in the side.\n\nSo far, it has worked. None of my boys has been sent to the naughty step.\n\n(Image: SIPA USA/PA Images)\n\nAnd it\u2019s something well worth looking at higher up the food chain.\n\nSince we are in the middle of another international break, I am climbing on my high horse and revisiting an area of the game I\u2019m passionate about \u2013 grass-roots football \u2013 because we need to get a grip.\n\nIn some regards, my lads are lucky, and not because they\u2019ve got me as their manager!\n\nWe play our home games on a 4G pitch, so at least the boys wake up on a Sunday morning and know their game will be on, whatever the weather.\n\nBut here we are, early in October, and already other games are being postponed because grass pitches are waterlogged.\n\n(Image: Surrey Advertiser)\n\nWhat chance have we got of playing in January if we can\u2019t maintain pitches to a decent standard barely two months into the season?\n\nI went to watch one game a few weeks ago and the \u2018surface\u2019 was a joke. The grass must have been five inches high \u2013 you could only see the top half of the ball \u2013 and the council hadn\u2019t bothered to mark the white lines.\n\nHow are kids going to develop when conditions are so poor?\n\nBut the sin bins have been a revelation. They are an excellent deterrent to ill discipline.\n\nIf you are ordered to cool down for 10 minutes, and your team concedes a goal while you're off the pitch, you are not going to be popular with your team-mates \u2013 or the manager.\n\nI\u2019ve adopted a hard-line approach to my players being sin-binned as part of a sea-change in my grass-roots mentality.\n\nAbove all, I still want the boys to enjoy playing \u2013 but at under-14 level, I\u2019ve decided that winning matters, too.\n\nAlready this year, we\u2019ve had three lads picked up by professional clubs \u2013 Liverpool, Preston and Rochdale \u2013 which gives me immense satisfaction.\n\nAnd if we go through the rest of the season without winning a game, but another 10 of my players are signed by clubs, I will regard that as success.\n\nBut the best way for these lads to get noticed by scouts is to play with ambition \u2013 in a team where winning is the target, not just having a game with your mates.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nI\u2019m trying to give them the best of both worlds \u2013 grass-roots ethics with Premier League desire.\n\nWhen I was lucky enough to be taken on by Manchester United as a teenager, I played for the youth team at weekends \u2013 but I was also allowed to play for the grass-roots team managed by my dad back home.\n\nI once played for United on a Saturday morning, went home and scored the winner in a derby game for my dad\u2019s side in Wrexham.\n\nIt meant that while I was cleaning boots and sweeping the dressing rooms at one of the biggest clubs in the world during the week, I never lost touch with the grass-roots culture where I came from.\n\nMy major incentive now, as manager of a team where all the boys have suffered the disappointment of rejection by professional club academies, is to get as many of them as possible back into the system.\n\nWe work hard, play to win, and if you play well, you keep the shirt. All the boys have bought into that mindset because they know there are scouts out there watching.\n\nAnd they know that if they are sent to the sin bin for dissent, it may be a long time before they get back in the side.\n\nI know there will be parents out there who disagree but, for me, from now on \u2013 at under-14 level and upwards - it\u2019s all about a combination of development and winning.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nLionel Messi played every minute of every game coming through grass roots and the age groups at Barcelona\u2019s academy.\n\nDo you think he would have become one of the greatest players of all time if he had been subbed every week to give a player of lesser ability a run?\n\nGrass-roots football exists for players to enjoy football, to develop... and in the case of my players, win.", "description": "There is nothing wrong with healthy competition - it develops a competitive edge in the younger players", "authors": ["Robbie Savage", "Image", "Reuters", "Sipa Usa Pa Images", "Surrey Advertiser", "Mirrorpix", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20562404.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Netherlands-Netherlands-vs-Northern-Ireland.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
