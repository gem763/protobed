Confusing. Cryptic.\n\nThose are some of the words one could use to describe what House Democrats are doing when it comes to impeachment.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is a very divisive issue,\u201d said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).\n\nDivisive, as to what impeachment even means.\n\nDEMS CLASH ATY THIRD DEBATE\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) tried to tamp down the semantic jousting at a meeting where Democrats set up parameters for an impeachment probe.\n\nOr something.\n\n\u201cSome call this process an impeachment inquiry. Some call it an impeachment investigation. There is no legal difference between these terms, and, I no longer care to argue about the nomenclature,\" lectured Nadler.\n\nThe word \u201cimpeachment\u201d is radioactive. Toxic.\n\nThat\u2019s why Pelosi bristled when reporters peppered her with questions about impeachment at her weekly press conference.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not answering your questions,\u201d said a defiant Pelosi when reporters posed their impeachment interrogatives. \u201cI said what I\u2019m going to say on the subject.\u201d\n\nYet reporters continued to prod and poke. All on impeachment.\n\n\u201cWhy is it that you are hung on the word over here?\u201d fumed Pelosi.\n\nThe Speaker then tried to pivot to an issue where Democrats believe they have the upper hand.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we spend some time going over to see (Senate Majority Leader) Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and asking him why he doesn\u2019t want to save lives?\u201d scolded the Speaker.\n\nSo, is it an impeachment inquiry?\n\n\u201cIt has been an impeachment inquiry,\u201d said Nadler.\n\nBut you\u2019ll understand the confusion.\n\nWhen asked if he thought it was an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) replied with an emphatic \u201cno.\u201d\n\nBut a couple of hours later, Hoyer wasn\u2019t as declarative. The Leader\u2019s office sent out a statement \u201cclarifying comments at Pen and Pad Press Conference.\u201d\n\nHoyer\u2019s mulligan reads as follows:\n\n\u201cI thought the question was in regards to whether the full House is actively considering articles of impeachment, which they are not at this time,\u201d said Hoyer. \u201cThe investigations by six different House committees into the widespread dishonesty, abuses of power and corruption in the Trump Administration are ongoing. I strongly support Chairman Nadler and the Judiciary Committee Democrats as they proceed with their investigation \u2018to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment to the full House,\u2019 as the resolution states. It is critical that Congress have access to all of the relevant facts, and, we will follow those facts wherever they lead, including impeachment.\u201d\n\nHoyer\u2019s toggling crystallizes the conundrum facing Democrats. They\u2019re not quite sure what to call the investigation by the committee. Democrats aren\u2019t actually impeaching the President \u2013 yet. But they are digging deep.\n\nRep. Al Green (D-TX) has tried to advance articles of impeachment on the House floor twice in the past two years. But even Green wasn\u2019t certain what House Democrats were doing.\n\n\u201cI am disappointed in the Judiciary Committee because there is no indication that the President\u2019s bigotry in policy will be part of their impeachment\u2026\u201d said Green, his voice trailing off.\n\nGreen was hunting for a word.\n\n\u201cOr whatever they are calling it,\u201d finished Green a few seconds later, triumphantly exclaiming \u201cimpeachment effort!\u201d\n\nThis is why Democrats are grousing behind closed doors. Liberals are worried they aren\u2019t doing enough on impeachment. Conservative Democrats will tell you privately that impeachment is like a black hole. Its gravitational pull is irreversible once your cross the political event horizon. Impeachment consumes everything.\n\nThere\u2019s risk in this impeachment-but-not-impeachment tactic for conservative Democrats from swing districts.\n\nRep. Anthony Brindisi (D-NY) is a case in point. He\u2019s a freshman Democrat who flipped an upstate New York seat from red to blue in the midterms.\n\n\u201cI would say that as a Democrat representing a moderate district, the voters sent me here to get things done. Health care. Prescription drugs. Infrastructure. I\u2019m worried that as investigations ramp up, it does take attention away from those issues.\u201d\n\nRep. Donna Shalala (D-FL) is also a freshman who seized a district last year which had been in Republican hands for decades. She shares Brindisi\u2019s concerns on impeachment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sucking all the air out of the good things we\u2019re doing,\u201d said Shalala. But Shalala conceded that Democrats may have no choice but to forge ahead with impeachment because it\u2019s a key tenet among liberals.\n\nMeantime, the impeachment inquest appears to be a gift to Republicans, striving to portray Democrats as too extreme. Republicans won\u2019t have too much trouble doing that if all of the talk is about impeachment.\n\nNo wonder Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA) said he would \u201cdouble dog dare\u201d Democrats to try to impeach President Trump. That could work to the GOP\u2019s advantage.\n\nThe problem for Democrats is that the public starts to interpret all of this as impeachment, regardless of gymnastics with the lexicon.\n\nIt will soon be up to Pelosi to determine how far they should go with impeachment. But frankly, the public is the final arbiter. Voters will determine if the Democrats\u2019 impeachment scramble is the right or wrong approach. Voters will make their positions known at the ballot box in 14 months.\n\nThere is also concern that the Democrats approach on impeachment - seeping into regular TV news coverage - could inflame the President. Lawmakers and Mr. Trump have to reach an agreement soon to avoid a government shutdown. There are also questions about advancing gun legislation and the U.S./Mexico/Canada trade agreement (USMCA). Lawmakers are concerned that talk about impeachment could incense the President if impeachment commands every headline he sees on TV. That could upend potential accord on any of those fronts. Remember, President Trump incinerated a meeting with Democrats on infrastructure in May. The President said it was because Pelosi was forging ahead with investigations and accused him of corruption.\n\nThe word \u201cinfrastructure\u201d has ne\u2019er been uttered at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue since.\n\nDoes Mr. Trump\u2019s unpredictability concern Hoyer when it comes to other issues?\n\n\u201cIt damn well does,\u201d thundered Hoyer.\n\nSo, this is impeachment. No articles of impeachment are ready to go to the House floor. Or maybe ever. But we are in the full gravitational clutches of impeachment now in Washington, regardless of what you call it.\n\nPerhaps Jerry Nadler summed it up best, chatting with reporters Monday night in the Speaker\u2019s Lobby just off the House floor: \u201cWhat we are doing is clear. It has been very clear. It continues to be very clear,\u201d said Nadler.", "description": "Those are some of the words one could use to describe what House Democrats are doing when it comes to impeachment.", "authors": ["Chad Pergram"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/10/694940094001_6084972916001_6084968699001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
