Here are the top three things she says will help you to stay physically healthy (and the last one might surprise you)\u2026\n\nIf you sit for one or two hours, you\u2019ll undo all the good work your exercising has done. Sitting is the new smoking. Professor Janet Lord\n\n7. Regular aerobic exercise is good\n\nBasically anything that increases your heart rate and gets your lungs going. \u201cYou know you\u2019ve been doing aerobic exercise,\u201d says Janet, \u201cif you\u2019re a little bit sweaty and your heart\u2019s beating a little bit faster.\u201d And how much? \u201cYou want to do about 150 minutes a week in 10 minute bursts. So it might be when you\u2019re going for a newspaper in the morning or you\u2019re walking the dog. Don\u2019t dawdle, go at a good pace, that\u2019s number one. That\u2019s looking after your heart and also your brain.\u201d\n\n8. Muscle strength matters\n\n\u201cYou need to keep your muscle strength,\u201d says Janet. \u201cThis means that you can get out of a chair easily, and that in turn means you can get off the toilet and with that you can keep your independence \u2013 it\u2019s as simple as that. Cross your arms and see how many times you can get out of your chair in 30 seconds. If you can only do it two or three times, do it every day and see if you can build your muscles up. Other simple things could be having a carrier bag with potatoes either side and gently lifting them up and down to build your strength.\u201d\n\n9. Don\u2019t sit still for too long\n\nIt\u2019s important to watch how much time you\u2019re sedentary, which is bad news for office workers. \u201cIf you sit for one or two hours,\u201d says Janet, \u201cyou\u2019ll undo all the good work your exercising has done. Sitting is the new smoking.\u201d\n\nYou can catch up with every episode of Woman\u2019s Hour on BBC Sounds, including the installments of this series on socialising, diet and exercise.
