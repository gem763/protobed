But while Harry has been visiting Botswana and Angola, the Duchess decided to make an unscheduled trip to an important place.\n\nLast month, 19-year-old Cape Town student Uyinene Mrwetyana was raped and murdered at a post office in the city. The crime highlighted South Africa's ongoing issue of gender-based violence, and sparked outrage across the country.\n\nAfter \"following what had happened from afar\" and being \"eager to learn more\", Meghan took the time to visit the spot where Uyinene was killed. The @SussexRoyal Instagram account posted a photograph of Meghan tying a ribbon this week at the site of the student's death.\n\n\"The Duchess of Sussex has tied a ribbon at the site... to pay her respects and to show solidarity with those who have taken a stand against gender based violence and femicide,\" the Instagram post read.\n\nPrior to her visit to the place of Uyinene's death, Meghan spoke to the student's mother of Uyinene to share the Sussexes' condolences. In recent days, the Duchess has also undertaken \"private visits and meetings... to deepen her understanding of the current situation and continue to advocate for the rights of women and girls.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Prince Harry has been in Angola retracing the steps his late mother, Princess Diana, made through a live minefield back in 1997.\n\nA statement from the palace regarding Harry\u2019s visit read: \"The Duke is humbled to be visiting a place and community that was so special to his mother, and to recognise her tireless mission as an advocate for all those she felt needed her voice the most, even if the issue was not universally popular.\"\n\nPhoto credit: Pool/Samir Hussein - Getty Images More\n\nHarry and Meghan will be reunited on Tuesday next week when the Prince flies back to South Africa. The family will meet in Johannesburg, where Meghan will attend a roundtable discussion with the Association of Commonwealth Universities to discuss the difficulties for women trying to access higher education.\n\nFollow Cat on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "This one wasn't on the itinerary.", "authors": ["Catriona Harvey-Jenner"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DWCsPxhIIqtYAIEsp4VtvQ--~B/aD0xNDQwO3c9Mjg3ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/542662dbef140be643d5effd611e0c9d", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
