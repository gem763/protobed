He\u2019s back, baby!\u201d The host highlighted another \u201cclassic gaffe\u201d when Biden called the Vermont senator \u201cPresident Sanders\u201d before correcting himself. As Biden, he added, \u201cSorry, I mean, President Sanders, I mean commander-in-chief Sanders, I\u2019m sorry, I mean, Colonel Sanders. His plan is finger-licking bad!\u201d\n\nFinally, Colbert dug into the fiery attack from Julian Castro against Biden when the former Housing and Urban Development secretary appeared to go after the former VP\u2019s age directly. \u201cAre you forgetting what you said just two minutes ago?\u201d he asked Biden as the crowd groaned in response.\n\n\u201cOhhhh!\u201d Colbert said. \u201cThe crowd did not like Julian playing the \u2018old man card.\u2019 I think he should really think twice about his new slogan: \u2018Castro 2020: Shove the Elderly onto an Ice Floe.\u2019\u201d The host then added, \u201cDon't worry, Julian, it\u2019s not like old people vote.\u201d", "description": "At the same time, the \u201cLate Show\u201d host called out Julian Castro for playing the \u201cold man card\u201d against Biden during the debate.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1434,w_2549,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568348987/SC_3_ruhhrb", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
