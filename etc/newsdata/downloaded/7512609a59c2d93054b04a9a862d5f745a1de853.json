Five years without going to stadiums. People don't deserve to suffer.' The 53-year-old then leaned forward and appeared to start to cry as the conversation moved on to the other guests.\n\nIt is believed Stoichkov is talking about a similar punishment to that imposed by UEFA in the aftermath of Heysel.\n\nEnglish club sides were banned from European club competitions for five years after 39 people were killed before the start of the 1985 European Cup final in Belgium.\n\nStoichkov won the Ballon d'Or in 1994 and won numerous titles with CSKA Sofia and Barcelona during his career.
