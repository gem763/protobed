As of yesterday that slide appears to have accelerated.\n\nThe most popular cryptocurrency by market cap slumped more than $600 in 30 minutes, falling back below $10,000 on Wednesday. Today it's down 2.8%, or -$270.6, heading lower for the third day, trimming a total of 8.85%, or $920, so far this week.\n\nNevertheless, even after a $3,290 or 25.5% drop since its high, Bitcoin is still up $,5606 or 146.35% for the year.\n\nThere's little clarity on why the cryptocurrency started moving higher, though some credited Facebook's (NASDAQ: ) , while others point to a rush to get in before halving, where the number of coin rewards generated will be divided by two.\n\nThe fundamentals behind Bitcoin's current plunge are equally murky. But the technicals are clear: the downside breakout of a pattern that\u2014should the price close lower\u2014suggests sellers have overwhelmed demand and are starting to lower their offers in order to find new buyers.\n\nBTC Daily Chart\n\nThe price has fallen below the bottom of a symmetrical triangle. This pattern\u2019s converging trendlines demonstrate an impasse between buyers and sellers. The downside breakout demonstrates that the stalemate has been resolved in favor of the bears.\n\nIf prices lock in below the triangle, it would be a signal that the market has synced into a coherent downtrend. Adding emphasis to this scenario: the downside breakout coincided with that of the uptrend line since late March.\n\nThe next break would be the support line between the May 30 high and the July 17 low, at $9,100. However, even then, the peak-trough succession would still be up.\n\nTrading Strategies\n\nConservative traders would short after a descending peak and trough series or go long after a high above the June 26, $13,764 peak to extend the uptrend.\n\nModerate traders may short after the price closes below the $9,100 presumed support line.\n\nAggressive traders may short after a close below the triangle.\n\nTrade Sample\n\nEntry: $9,750, upon a rally\n\nStop-Loss: $10,000, to absorb a return move to the key figure\n\nRisk: $250\n\nTarget: $9,000\n\nReward: $750\n\nRisk:Reward Ratio: 1:3", "description": "Market Analysis by Investing.com (Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com) covering: Facebook Inc, Investing.com Bitcoin Index.
