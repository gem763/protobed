Mandatory Credit: Douglas DeFelice-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWashington Redskins rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins might have the same chance Sunday when the NFC East rivals meet in the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J.\n\nWashington starter Case Keenum (foot) didn\u2019t participate in a walkthrough Wednesday after undergoing an MRI exam, reportedly walking around the team facility in a walking boot. Redskins coach Jay Gruden said Keenum would get the start if at all possible, but conceded he\u2019ll have to look at other options just in case.\n\nThose options include veteran backup Colt McCoy \u2014 who has been out since breaking his leg late last season \u2014 or Haskins, the 15th overall pick in April\u2019s draft out of Ohio State. With Washington off to an 0-3 start and already three games behind NFC East-leading Dallas, there is sentiment that it might as well begin Haskins\u2019 developmental clock.\n\nBut Gruden sounded Wednesday like someone who might prefer a veteran \u2014 whether it\u2019s Keenum or McCoy \u2014 to pilot the Redskins\u2019 fourth attempt at their first win.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll evaluate everything (later in the week), see where Case is,\u201d Gruden told reporters after the walkthrough. \u201cI assume Case is going to be able to play. He\u2019s a tough guy.\u201d\n\nKeenum has statistically been good, ranking fourth in the NFL with 311 passing yards per game and completing nearly 70 percent of his passes. But he also hurt Washington\u2019s chances Monday night in a 31-15 home loss to Chicago by tossing three interceptions and losing two fumbles, more than negating 332 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nMcCoy, who broke his leg in December and hasn\u2019t practiced fully in six weeks, was listed as a full participant on Wednesday\u2019s injury report. But Haskins got most of the work during Wednesday\u2019s walkthrough.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just wait and see,\u201d Gruden said about deciding on a starter. \u201cWe got a little ways to go before I make any crazy decisions.\u201d\n\nThere are no decisions right now for New York coach Pat Shurmur regarding his starting quarterback. Jones, making his first career start in place of benched Eli Manning, was spectacular last week in a 32-31 win at Tampa Bay. He hit 23 of 36 passes for 336 yards and two scores while adding another two scores on the ground \u2014 including the go-ahead 7-yard run with 1:16 remaining as the Giants improved to 1-2.\n\nHowever, there were teachable moments for the No. 6 overall selection from Duke. Jones lost a couple of fumbles, but they were forgiven somewhat in the glow of his performance.\n\n\u201cThe main thing is ball security,\u201d Jones told reporters. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to turn the ball over twice like that in critical points in the game. I think that\u2019s the first thing. There are other things, specific to plays, that I look to correct and learn from, but I\u2019m excited to do that.\u201d\n\nJones will have to make those adjustments without Saquon Barkley around. The second-year running back from Penn State will miss the next four-to-eight weeks with a high ankle sprain suffered against the Buccaneers.\n\nBarkley was off to another good start, rushing for more than 100 yards in losses to Dallas and Buffalo while adding 11 receptions in his two-plus games. Wayne Gallman will replace Barkley in the lineup.\n\n\u201cI view it as a big opportunity, an opportunity I\u2019ve had since I\u2019ve been in the league,\u201d Gallman said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate for my brother to go out, but this is what I\u2019ve prepared for, so I\u2019m ready for it. I knew at some point he could get hurt, and I always have to be ready.\u201d\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "New York Giants rookie quarterback Daniel Jones made a strong first impression in Week 3.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434039832&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0D7-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
