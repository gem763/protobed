It\u2019s not just Trump they are branding illegitimate, but anyone who voted for him.\n\nThey have been trying to cancel the last election since November 2016, and have driven themselves collectively mad in the attempt.\n\nForget that they are closer to the next election than the last and that their latest impeachment gambit will only make their task next November more difficult.\n\nAll that matters is Hillary\u2019s vindication.\n\n\u201cThree years after the historic election of 2016, she is still grappling with defeat,\u201d intoned Jane Pauley on \u201cCBS Sunday Morning\u201d by way of introducing the failed presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cHow are you doing now,\u201d Pauley asked Hillary, voice oozing with compassion. \u201cAnd what are the metrics by which you know how you\u2019re doing on any given day?\u201d\n\nIt was as if she were talking to a cancer patient.\n\nBut it was just Hillary, self-engrossed, artificially calm, eternally aggrieved, her mute daughter, Chelsea, sitting beside her like a human prop.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I\u2019m doing well and having my grandchildren \u2026 has been a gift beyond measure. I feel very blessed. I feel good. But I can\u2019t deny that a big part of me cares deeply about what\u2019s happening in the country and what I fear is the damage that\u2019s being done to our future.\u201d\n\nThis is the great Hillary psychodrama which has consumed the Democratic Party for almost three years. No one is willing to come out and declare that she screwed up all by herself, so they are forever doomed to repeat her mistakes. She is the real human tornado \u2014 an F5 of rage, indignation, spite and pain.\n\nCrates of Chardonnay in Chappaqua didn\u2019t calm her. Nor did \u201calternate nostril-breathing\u201d yoga. She tried writing a cathartic book about the race, \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d but it just showcased her narcissism and refusal to admit fault.\n\nEarlier this month, she was reduced to tweeting bizarre photos of herself at the Venice Biennale, a flesh-and-blood art exhibit, sitting at a replica Resolute Desk, reading aloud her infamous e-mails.\n\n\u201cFound my emails at the Venice Biennale,\u201d she gaily tweeted. \u201cSomeone alert the House GOP.\u201d Boom tish.\n\nFortuitously for her, last week, the impeachment saga gave her a new lease on life, and maybe a glimmer of hope that the great injustice of 2016 might at last be righted.\n\nAnd now, she has an excuse to insert herself into the 2020 campaign as a last-resort candidate: a new book, co-written with her faithful sidekick Chelsea, 39.\n\nThe subtext of \u201cThe Book of Gutsy Women\u201d is that Hillary is the gutsiest of them all.\n\n\u201cPick me, pick me,\u201d she all but plaintively wails, as she embarks on a \u201clistening tour\u201d like the ones she used to launch other ill-fated campaigns.\n\nThe Clintons\u2019 Gutsy Woman Tour officially kicks off in Brooklyn on Tuesday night.\n\nBut we had a sneak preview last week.\n\nAs House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday, Hillary popped up in People magazine to denounce Trump as \u201ca reckless, corrupt human tornado who cares only about himself.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, after Trump released the transcript of his phone call with the Ukrainian president, she took to Twitter: \u201cThe president of the United States has betrayed our country\u201d.\n\nThursday night, she surfaced at a National Abortion Rights Action League function: \u201cThis occupant of the Oval Office is a clear and present danger \u2026 If you are more outraged than ever that Brett Kavanaugh has a lifetime job, you have to make it a voting issue.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, it was Georgetown University. Trump \u201chas turned American diplomacy into a cheap extortion racket,\u201d said Hillary, who would know. After all, when she was secretary of state, her Clinton Foundation raked in millions of dollars from foreign governments.\n\nBut politics is all projection these days.\n\nThe bottom line is Hillary isn\u2019t going away. As much as DNC operatives on Sunday-morning TV shows tried to close down any mention of her, there she was on CBS, dutiful Chelsea by her side.\n\n\u201cThe objective is to field whoever is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump,\u201d Hillary said. Hint, hint.\n\nLosing the 2016 election \u201cwas like applying for a job and getting 66 million letters of recommendation and losing to a corrupt human tornado,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t kill me because he knows he\u2019s an illegitimate president.\u201d\n\nIt really is demented for a 71-year-old adult to be so psychologically incapable of accepting defeat.\n\nShe has been on a near three-year hissy fit. She cloaks her rage and neediness with the pretense that she is a stateswoman assisting the next generation of women when every woman knows she is a born Mean Girl.\n\nNo champion of women would reduce her adult daughter to dumb note-taker and adoring cipher. Forever cowering in her mother\u2019s shadow, Chelsea is not allowed to be a gutsy woman.\n\nThere\u2019s only ever been room for Hillary on the stage. And unless the Democrats finally find the guts to push her off, they may as well sit out the next election.\n\nNo, Rudy, you\u2019re not \u201cthe hero\u201d\n\nWith a friend like Rudy Giuliani, who needs enemies? Donald Trump\u2019s TV lawyer has only made things worse for him over Ukraine. It\u2019s sad.\n\nThose of us who remember \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor\u201d from 9/11 can only feel maudlin at the freak show he has become. It\u2019s hard to shake the image of Giuliani, covered in white dust, two blocks from Ground Zero, comforting police, calling for calm, the staunch leader who went to every funeral and held this city together.\n\nNow he\u2019s the lunatic on Fox News, yelling at a fellow panelist, \u201cShut up, moron. Shut up. Shut up. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, idiot.\u201d\n\nOr the delusional egomaniac telling The Atlantic, \u201cIt is impossible that the whistleblower is a hero and I\u2019m not. And I will be the hero! These morons \u2014 when this is over, I will be the hero.\u201d\n\nTime to step away from the microphone.\n\nRisking their lives with every arrest\n\nIf Mayor Bill de Blasio needs a reminder of how dangerous arrests are for police, the death of NYPD Officer Brian Mulkeen early Sunday says it all.\n\nMulkeen, 33, was shot in The Bronx by a gang member resisting arrest. He was a good cop doing his job, despite the climate of disrespect for law enforcement.\n\nYet if you follow the logic of de Blasio and his Police Department when they sacked Officer Daniel Pantaleo over the Eric Garner tragedy, arrests are a breeze and police have no reason to fear for their lives. Reality says otherwise.
