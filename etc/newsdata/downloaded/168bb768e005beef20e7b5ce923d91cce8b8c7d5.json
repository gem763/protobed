(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nStock futures were higher Friday morning ahead of the August employment report\u2019s release and Federal Reserve Jerome Powell\u2019s speech.\n\nHere were the main pre-market moves, as of 7:30 a.m. ET:\n\nS&P futures (ES=F): +0.30%, or 9 points\n\nDow futures (YM=F): +0.33%, or 87 points\n\nNasdaq futures (NQ=F): +0.24%, or 18.50 points\n\nCrude oil (CL=F): -2.13% to $55.10 per barrel\n\nGold (GC=F): -0.72%, or $1,514.50 per ounce\n\nThe ongoing U.S.-China trade war continued to whipsaw markets this week. September was off to a rocky start until top negotiators of the world\u2019s two largest economies spoke on the phone Thursday and agreed to hold high-level trade talks in early October.\n\nBoth the August jobs report and Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech will be the focal points for investors Friday. August\u2019s jobs report comes at a critical time, as trade tensions, slowing global growth and overall uncertainty keep investors on edge. August was a brutally volatile month for the stock market with wild swings in both directions. In addition, with multiple brief inversions of the yield curve during the month, fears of a possible recession sent market watchers into a frenzy.\n\nJobs, jobs, jobs\n\nEconomists polled by Bloomberg are expecting the U.S. economy to have added 160,000 nonfarm payrolls in August, down from the 164,000 positions added in July. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.7%.\n\n\u201cAmid the volatility of financial markets seeming to mirror the rest of the world, the U.S. job market has remained a veritable pillar of stability,\u201d Mark Hamrick, Bankrate.com\u2019s senior economic analyst, wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance. \u201cIn terms of relatively stability, the upcoming August employment reading should be no exception, with the emphasis on \u2018should.\u2019 The key question is whether the U.S. economy continues to grow in the face of these headwinds.\u201d\n\nThe BLS report comes after a new report from ADP Research Institute and Moody\u2019s on Thursday showed that job growth in the U.S. private sector was better than economists\u2019 expectations in August . The U.S. private sector added 195,000 positions in August, higher than the 148,000 positions Wall Street was predicting.\n\nJuly\u2019s figure was revised down to 142,000, from the 156,000 positions that was initially reported.\n\n\u201cIn August we saw a rebound in private-sector employment,\u201d Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute said in a statement. \u201cThis is the first time in the last 12 months that we have seen balanced job growth across small, medium and large-sized companies.\u201d\n\nMark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, added, \u201cBusinesses are holding firm on their payrolls despite the slowing economy. Hiring has moderated, but layoffs remain low. As long as this continues recession will remain at bay.\u201d\n\nThough the ADP report is not always a reliable indicator of what the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) report will illustrate, it does provide a bit of insight into the health of employment in the U.S.\n\nPowell speaks\n\nMeanwhile, Fed Chair Powell is expected to speak in Zurich on the \u201cEconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy\u201d around 12:30 p.m. ET.\n\nInvestors have been hyper-focused on the Fed in recent days as the September policy meeting approaches. Markets are expecting another rate cut at this month\u2019s meeting following the central bank\u2019s first interest rate cut in more than a decade at its July meeting.\n\nA couple of weeks ago at the Jackson Hole conference, Powell expressed that the Fed would do what it needs in order to prolong the current economic expansion. He explained that the U.S. is facing more challenges now than it was at the Fed\u2019s most recent policy meeting. \u201c\u201cThe three weeks since our July FOMC meeting have been eventful, beginning with the announcement of new tariffs on imports from China,\u201d Powell said in Jackson Hole. On Sunday, 15% U.S. tariffs were added on more than $100 billion worth of Chinese imports, as the trade war between the U.S. and China continues to rage on.\n\nSTOCKS: Lululemon jumps, Zoom video falls on earnings\n\nAthleisure brand Lululemon (LULU) shares jumped in pre-market trade after second-quarter results beat expectations Thursday evening. Lululemon also boosted its full-year sales and profit outlook. Same-store sales, a key industry metric, rose 15% during the quarter with men\u2019s sales continuing to dominate with 35% growth. Sales were also strong in North America. Revenue in the region surged 21%. Lululemon reported earnings of 96 cents per share on $883.35 million in revenue.
