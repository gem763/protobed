The problem, apparently, is energy-efficient lightbulbs.\n\nTalking before an audience of Republican legislators in Baltimore on Thursday night, Trump gave a rambling speech in which he tackled criticism of his recent plans to weaken regulations on environmentally friendly bulbs.\n\n\u201cThe lightbulb,\u201d the president began. \u201cPeople said: what\u2019s with the lightbulb? I said: here\u2019s the story. And I looked at it. The bulb that we\u2019re being forced to use! No 1, to me, most importantly, the light\u2019s no good. I always look orange. And so do you! The light is the worst.\u201d\n\nBut that was not the end of it. Trump \ufeffcomplained that the energy-efficient bulb is many times more expensive than its incandescent predecessor and, he claimed, needs to be treated as \u201chazardous waste\u201d if it breaks.\n\nEnergy-efficient bulbs such as halogen incandescents, compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) typically use about 25 to 80% less energy than traditional incandescents, and can last up to 25 times longer.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t good enough for Trump. He continued: \u201cWhat are we doing? It\u2019s considered hazardous waste, but it\u2019s many times more expensive and frankly the light is not as good. So we\u2019re going to sell them, but we\u2019re also going to sell incandescent bulbs. People are very happy about it. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d", "description": "President says energy-efficient bulbs do him no favours: \u2018The light\u2019s no good. I always look orange.
