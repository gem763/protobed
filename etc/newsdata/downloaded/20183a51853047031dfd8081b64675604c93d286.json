She asked him why \u201call roads lead to Putin,\u201d as she stood up and pointed a finger at Trump before leaving the meeting.\n\nIn his remarks Sunday, Trump said the United States had informed Russia of the mission because U.S. forces were going to fly over certain \u201cRussia-held areas.\u201d Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, was quoted by Russian state media as saying that his ministry has \u201cno reliable information\u201d about the raid.\n\nTrump also said he had contacted two Senate Republicans, Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (N.C.) and Judiciary Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), ahead of his announcement in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House. He called Burr \u201ca great gentleman\u201d and Graham \u201ca very strong hawk\u201d who \u201cagrees with what we\u2019re doing now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAsked whether he had informed Pelosi, Trump replied, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t do that. I wanted to make sure this kept secret. I don\u2019t want to have men lost, and women. I don\u2019t want to have people lost.\u201d\n\nAt another point in his remarks, Trump said he was \u201cgoing to notify [congressional leaders] last night, but we decided not to do that, because Washington leaks like I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\n\u201cWashington is a leaking machine,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I told my people, we will not notify them until our great people are out \u2014 not just in, but out. I don\u2019t want to have them greeted with firepower like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d\n\nTrump did not cite evidence for his accusation that Pelosi would have leaked details of the raid. Pelosi served on the House Intelligence Committee for more than 20 years and has not been known to reveal sensitive information. Last weekend, she led a high-level congressional delegation to Afghanistan and did not publicly disclose the trip until the group had returned.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn an interview on ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said Trump did not contact Pelosi, Schiff or any of the other congressional leaders with whom the White House typically shares information on national security and intelligence matters.\n\n\u201cIn terms of notifying the Gang of Eight, that wasn\u2019t done,\u201d Schiff said, referring to the House speaker and minority leader, the Senate majority and minority leaders, and the chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate intelligence committees.\n\nSchiff said Trump made \u201ca mistake\u201d by not informing congressional leaders of the raid, although he noted that such notifications are \u201cfrankly, more important when things go wrong.\u201d The executive branch usually informs the Gang of Eight, Schiff said, so that if a mission goes awry, the White House can at least say that Congress was made aware of the risks and was given the opportunity to provide feedback.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSusan E. Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama, said Sunday that the Obama administration typically sought to keep the Gang of Eight informed \u201cas a matter of courtesy.\u201d\n\nIn May 2011, for instance, when Osama bin Laden was killed, then-House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) told reporters that the Obama administration had been keeping him abreast of developments over several months.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been talking to Mr. Panetta over these four months and over this weekend,\u201d Rogers said, referring to then-CIA Director Leon Panetta. \u201cSo we knew when the president authorized it, and we had some discussions that it was likely to happen, and then got a call after it happened.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOther Democratic leaders on Sunday called for the White House to answer lawmakers\u2019 questions.\n\n\u201cNew Yorkers know all too well the destruction a small group of terrorists thousands of miles overseas can cause from so far away,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement.\n\nHe added that he looks forward to a briefing about the raid and the administration\u2019s next steps against the Islamic State.\n\nAD", "description": "The House speaker called on the president to brief lawmakers on the operation, which Trump said killed the Islamic State leader.", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/O4s4sDtEHqD9zMrFdb8LlLzrI3g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WJBJIRHY2AI6TAMQNPSN5NLOAE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
