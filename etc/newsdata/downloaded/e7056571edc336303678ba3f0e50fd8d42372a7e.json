Bouee resigned following the investigation.\n\n\"We are not commenting on the ongoing criminal proceedings,\" UBS said on Sunday. \"We are very happy to have Iqbal Khan in our team. He is concentrating fully on his role at UBS and is in close contact with employees and clients.\"", "description": "UBS wants new recruit Khan to drop criminal complaint over spying: paper", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9Q0EN_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
