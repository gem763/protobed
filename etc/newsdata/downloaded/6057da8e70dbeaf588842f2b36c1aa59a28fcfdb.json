I think it's time we stood up and say 'we are ginger, and we are going to fight'\".\n\nHarry replies: \"This is slightly awkward. There may have been a miscommunication - this is about World Mental Health Day?\"\n\nSheeran appears horrified by his error and the camera cuts to him hastily deleting the title of his \"Gingers Unite\" campaign from his computer.\n\nThe clip then finishes with the duke urging viewers to reach out to friends and family for World Mental Health Day which takes place today.\n\nThe video comes after a cryptic post about their meeting was also shared from the royal's Instagram account yesterday.\n\nWorld Mental Health Day is observed every year on October 10 and seeks to raise awareness about mental health issues.\n\nThis year, the World Federation for Mental Health (WFMH) has decided to make \u201csuicide prevention\u201d the main theme.\n\nMore than 800,000 people die by suicide a year, making it the main cause of death among young people.\n\nHarry, 35, recently completed a well-received tour of South Africa where he discussed his own mental health battles.\n\nOne local said after meeting the royal: \"Harry said that he often woke up and felt overwhelmed by too many problems in the world.\n\n\u201cThat sometimes it\u2019s hard to get out of bed in the mornings because of all the issues.\n\n\u201cBut he wanted to use their platform to enable grass-roots change and to try and create a better society.\u201d", "description": "Ed Sheeran had proposed that the pair team up for \"Gingers Unite\"\u00a0 - before being shot down by the duke - in a video recorded for World Mental Health day", "authors": ["Neil Murphy"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20549974.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BLPP_CHP_PMI_15889JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
