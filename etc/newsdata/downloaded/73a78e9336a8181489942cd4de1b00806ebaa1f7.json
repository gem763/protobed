It must be like kissing your grandma. I watched McFly on T4 afterwards and Dougie said how horny he thought that kiss was.

The kiss came at the last ever G.A.Y. night at the Astoria in Soho in July 2008\n\nThe big reveal comes after the Loose Women panelists were accused of hypocrisy after claiming women should get to retire earlier than men - to make up for not being paid equally during their working lives.\n\nFollowing the High Court ruling that raising the state pension age for women to 66, in line with men, is not discriminatory, Kaye Adams, Nadia Sawalha, K\u00e9ll\u00e9 Bryan and Carol discussed whether it's fair that women should be made to work later into life.\n\nNadia, 54, argued that the issue of equal pay needed to be dealt with before the age of retirement was raised, as the pay gap means women make less money in their working life.\n\nHappy days: He was feeling bashful about the steamy kiss\n\nHowever the presenter was met by hoards of comments, mainly from men, claiming that she doesn't want 'equality' and simply wants to 'have her cake and eat it'.\n\nThe debate followed the High Court ruling that means up to 4 million women must keep working after ministers raised their state pension age from 60 to 66.\n\nTwo women \u2013 Julie Delve, 61, and Karen Glynn, 63 \u2013 brought the legal challenge, arguing that the changes were discriminatory on the grounds of age and sex, and that they were not given adequate notice.\n\nBut two High Court judges dismissed their claims on all grounds, and yesterday's ruling means up to 4 million women must keep working after ministers raised their state pension age from 60 to 66.", "description": "Yet Carol McGiffin, 49, and McFly's Dougie Poynter, 31, revealed that 11 years ago they shared a steamy kiss in a shock revelation on Thursday's Loose Women", "authors": ["Ciara Farmer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/15/19842124-0-image-a-4_1571322247231.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
