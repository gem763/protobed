The exhibition, by Swedish photographer Johan B\u00e4vman, has toured 65 countries, but this is its first time in the United States.\n\nAs he debuts his photo series for an American audience, B\u00e4vman hopes to tell a story of gender equality in parenting, of a new perception of masculinity and what a society could look like if it truly prioritized both.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if there were women in the pictures,\u201d B\u00e4vman said as he unveiled the exhibition at the Swedish Embassy on Thursday night. \u201cThese dads aren\u2019t super dads. This is just a discussion about why we see these men as special, not because they are special. They\u2019re doing the work women have done for decades.\u201d\n\nOnly 6 countries give women the same work rights as men. The U.S. isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nWhile the United States is the only industrialized country that does not guarantee workers paid leave, Sweden has one of the most generous paid family leave policies in the world. It became the first country to introduce a gender-neutral paid parental leave benefit \u2014 in 1974. And today, parents are allowed to take 480 days of paid parental leave per child. For 13 of those months, they are entitled to 80 percent of income, up to a certain income level, and for three months, are given a flat rate of about $20 a day, according to the Swedish Embassy.\n\nSweden has also offered fathers incentives to take more of the paid leave. Three of the paid months are reserved for each parent and cannot be transferred. Families can also get an \u201cequality bonus\u201d determined by the number of days divided equally between parents.\n\nAnd in recent years, Sweden has seen the impact of its policies on women. Economists at Stanford University recently examined the effects of paid leave reforms in Sweden and found that giving the father more work flexibility improved the mother\u2019s health and reduced her risk of experiencing physical postpartum health complications.\n\nSweden is also a leader among advanced economies in female labor participation. As of last year, more than 88 percent of women ages 25 to 54 worked. But in the United States, that figure was 74 percent, according to a report from the International Monetary Fund. Still, both countries have a similar fertility rate \u2014 at about 1.7.\n\nThis, the Swedish ambassador to the United States said on Thursday night, is proof that more women working does not necessarily mean fewer births.\n\nAmbassador Karin Olofsdotter spoke about her own division of parental leave. For example, when her first child was born, she took 10 months off work, and her husband took six months off. This shared caregiving has proved essential to her career, she said. And now, \u201cI can be the first female ambassador to the United States, with the help of my husband, of course.\u201d\n\nBut as Olofsdotter pointed out, Sweden is far from perfect. Despite all of the incentives for men to take leave, Swedish fathers still only use less than 30 percent of the total amount of parental leave days.\n\nEven in this place considered a \u201cutopia for gender equality,\u201d men are not holding up their end of the bargain, B\u00e4vman said.\n\n\u201cThe main reason is masculinity, the way men see themselves, and the way society sees men,\u201d B\u00e4vman said. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest issue we have to change. That men believe in themselves in the caregiving role, that it can also be masculine.\u201d\n\nB\u00e4vman began the project when he was on parental leave with his oldest son, now age 7. As a new father, he was terrified, afraid of making mistakes and not being the kind of parent he wanted to be, B\u00e4vman said. He sought out role models of other new fathers taking on the primary caregiving roles, but all he saw were \u201cglamorous pictures of dads on playgrounds\u201d on Instagram, he said.\n\n\u201cI wanted to have role models that could express failures, frustration, tiredness,\u201d he said. So he set out to make these images himself, first through selfies with his own son. He then began following the lives of men across Sweden, meeting some through posters he put up at day-care centers.\n\nHe wanted to capture fathers not only taking on the tasks that mothers are often known for \u2014 cooking, cleaning, potty training \u2014 but also fathers showing vulnerability. The image that stands out the most to B\u00e4vman shows a father looking out the window while a baby sleeps in a sling, against his chest. It\u2019s a nurturing image, one often associated with maternity. It also shows the man\u2019s fears, his uncertainties, B\u00e4vman said.\n\nB\u00e4vman reflected on his own father, who spent more time at home than many other fathers of his generation. But as a young adult and even now, B\u00e4vman said he doesn\u2019t feel that he can open up about his emotions to his father in the same way he could with his mother, who died seven years ago. He said he hopes that isn\u2019t the case with his own two sons.\n\n\u201cI am trying to cry as much as I can in front of my children,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s really important, to show that I as a dad can be vulnerable, that I can be also afraid of something. I want them to feel comfortable crying in front of me.\u201d\n\nDads win settlement with JPMorgan Chase over parental leave policy\n\nFollowing the lives of these Swedish families, B\u00e4vman said he also has seen women struggle to trust their husbands to take on more of the tasks at home.\n\nAs much as men need to confront their own uncertainties, B\u00e4vman said, \u201cit\u2019s also about women letting go.\u201d\n\nWalking around the exhibit on Thursday, Nya Alemayhu, a 31-year-old real estate agent, stopped to admire one image of a father vacuuming with an infant on his back.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see a lot of men in this position,\u201d she said, thinking of her childhood in Ethiopia. \u201cMy dad, my grandfather, my uncles would never be caught dead vacuuming with a baby on their back. That picture illustrates what women have been doing for so long.\u201d\n\nPatrick Gebhardt, a 49-year-old designer whose wife works for the Swedish Embassy, said he felt a pang of nostalgia while looking at a photo of a father watching his two children play. Gebhardt thought back to when he took his parental leave, in Sweden for his first son, Benjamin, and in Paris for his younger daughter, Charlotte. \u201cIt\u2019s like looking back again. It was such a good time,\u201d he said, smiling.\n\nWhen he lived in Sweden, especially in a bigger city, it was more culturally expected that fathers take their parental leave. He was surrounded by a community of fathers who were also taking time off work to be with their children. But when he moved to Paris, he felt more isolated as a stay-at-home father. And when he went back to work, his male colleagues in France hardly ever talked about their children.\n\n\u201cIn Sweden, people always talk about their children, like \u2018Yesterday she threw up and I had to take care of that,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nAs he walked around the photos on Thursday evening, he felt the urge to cry, he said. \u201cI don\u2019t really know why.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the most precious thing you can do, being with your child,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want to go home now and see them go to bed and maybe read for them.\u201d", "description": "The photo exhibition \"Swedish Dads\" is on display at the Embassy of Sweden in D.C., and aims to show the effects of Sweden's generous parental leave system.", "authors": ["Samantha Schmidt", "Reporter Covering Gender", "Family Issues"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7P3ISMWQ54I6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
