That would have made it available to airlines during the holiday travel period, critical to profits.\n\n\"Our top priority remains the safe return to service of the 737 Max, and we're making steady progress,\" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement.\n\nSeveral major airlines, suspecting that the plane's revisions would take longer than expected, have pushed back its return in their flight schedules into early next year.\n\nBoeing said \"for the purposes of the third-quarter results\" that it released Wednesday, it is assuming regulators will clear the plane for return to service in the current quarter. It, however, doesn't indicate whether it will be one regulatory body, like the Federal Aviation Administration, or several. Some global aircraft regulators have hinted, for instance, that they may not reapprove the plane at the same time as the FAA.\n\nBoeing is also careful to say the timing is out of its control: it's up regulators.\n\nMore about the 737 Max:FAA asks Boeing why it hid test pilot's discovery of 'egregious' 737 Max issues\n\nThe 737 Max is the latest version of the venerable jetliner that flown in various versions since the 1960s. The Max was grounded worldwide after an Ethiopian Airlines crash in March that killed 157 passengers and crew. It followed another accident a year ago in which a 737 Max flown by Lion Air crashed into the Java Sea, killing 189.\n\nIn both crashes, investigators' attention has focused on flight control software that had been put into the Max, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS. It was added in the latest version in an attempt to make the jets feel to pilots like previous versions of the 737 even though the Max has larger engines that were repositioned on the wing, making it respond differently in some circumstances.\n\nBut instead of helping, quietly operating in the background, MCAS appears to have factored in the crashes. The system overrode the actions of pilots in both accidents, pointing the noses of their jets down as crew tried to keep the planes airborne. Ultimately, they lost the battle and the 737s plummeted. Boeing has been redesigning the system to give pilots more control, the issue that's holding up the Max's return.\n\nMore fallout:Blasting Boeing, FAA recommends changes in certification process\n\n737 Max crash:Whistleblower complaint alleges corruption in Ethiopian Airlines\n\nTroubles with the Max continue to dog Boeing. Muilenburg was stripped of dual role as chairman of Boeing this month and the Chicago-based company just replaced the head of its Commercial Airplanes unit, Kevin McAllister. Muilenburg is likely to face tough questioning as he is scheduled to testify to a House committee for the first time about the Max next week.\n\nMaking matters worse, Boeing revealed that a test pilot voiced doubts about MCAS during simulator tests in an after-hours electronic message exchange with another employee in 2016 \u2014 and didn't turn over the information to the FAA until last week. The FAA has demanded to know why it wasn't informed sooner.\n\nThen there are the financial issues, led by the Max. On Wednesday, Boeing, citing lower 737 deliveries, reported it completed 62 new planes during the third quarter compared to 190 a year ago. Net earnings for the quarter fell 51% to $1.2 billion in the quarter. Revenue was down 21% to $20 billion.\n\nAnother setback for Boeing:FAA-ordered inspection finds cracks in wing supports of 36 Boeing 737s7", "description": "Boeing's 737 Max nightmare continues as the plane is yet to be certified to fly after two crashes.
