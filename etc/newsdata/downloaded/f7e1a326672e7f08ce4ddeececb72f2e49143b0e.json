USTR will continually re-evaluate these tariffs based on our discussions with the EU,\u201d USTR said.\n\nAirbus and U.S. firm Boeing (BA.N), the world\u2019s two largest planemakers, have waged a war of attrition over subsidies at the WTO since 2004, in a dispute that has tested the trade policeman\u2019s influence and is expected to set the tone for competition from would-be rivals from China.", "description": "Scottish whisky makers said on Thursday jobs and investment were at risk after the United States slapped a 25% tariff on their single malt spirit and France said the European Union could respond in the row over EU aircraft subsidies.", "authors": ["Kate Holton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436597269&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920Q2"}
