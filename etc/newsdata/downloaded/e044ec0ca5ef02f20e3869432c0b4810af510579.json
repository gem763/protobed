Nearly two-thirds were suicides. It was the largest yearly total on record in the C.D.C.\u2019s electronic database, which goes back 50 years, and reflects the sheer number of lives lost.\u201d\n\nTo my mind the goal is as simple as the task is daunting: We must reduce the overall number of guns in the population, especially those considered weapons of war; we must shrink the market desire for new weapons; and we must set a course to not only pass a new law in a moment but build in the expectation that federal legislation around guns will be the never-ending, ever-adjusting reality.\n\nPeople interested in reducing gun violence in America have to stop lying about what that would require. Opponents of new gun legislation will accuse its supporters of seeking the worse no matter what they do.\n\nBut also, the opponents are right in some of their arguments. Can I or anyone else point to a specific proposal and say it would have affected this or that specific mass shooting? Occasionally yes, but often not. But that\u2019s not the point. The point is to see a reduction in all shootings. And that argument actually reinforces a need to aggressively fund studies to figure out which measures would work best.\n\nThey are right when they say that restrictions on new purchases would place a burden on responsible gun owners \u2014 the overwhelming majority of gun owners \u2014 when only a tiny fraction participate in shootings. To that I say: AND?! Nearly 40,000 people in 2017 were killed by guns in this country. If a reduction in that number comes with more red tape for you, then so be it.\n\nThis is a public health crisis, as O\u2019Rourke points out, and anything we can do to prevent guns from being used in a crime, to prevent a child from accidentally shooting a sibling, to prevent a depressed person from putting a barrel in his or her mouth, must be a consuming priority for all of us.", "description": "Beto O\u2019Rourke is rare among politicians for speaking honestly of wanting aggressive limits.", "authors": ["Charles M.
