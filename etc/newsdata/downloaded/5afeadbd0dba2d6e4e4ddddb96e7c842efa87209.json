For instance, a partner at Bitazu Capital recently found that BTC\u2019s price is nearing a bottom. He noted that a number of technical indicators suggest that the bear trend is about to reverse.\n\nThe fundamental side of the Bitcoin story is also gaining traction. On Friday, Abigail Johnson, chief executive of Fidelity Investments, told Financial Times that the firm\u2019s cryptocurrency branch will finally be rolling out its Bitcoin and cryptocurrency custodial and trade execution services to all qualified accounts \u2014 institutional players.\n\nJohnson also said that she believes that Bitcoin is not a mere trend and is instead here to stay:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going away. As long as the value is there, people will look to preserve that value.\u201d\n\nNot In The Clear Just Yet\n\nWhile the bull case for Bitcoin is growing, this market is not in the clear just yet.\n\nPer previous reports from this very outlet, a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d which is when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average for an asset, is forming on the Bitcoin chart. Should this technical pattern come to fruition on Bitcoin\u2019s chart, it will show that bears have control of this market. As a trader pointed out, the last BTC death cross, which was observed in 2018, marked the commencement of a long-term price correction.\n\nAlso, Peter Schiff, a prominent libertarian investor, has suggested that BTC\u2019s price chart \u201clooks horrible.\u201d\n\nSchiff, in fact, remarked that the \u201c(bear) flag that followed the recent breakdown projects a move to $6,000,\u201d which would imply a 25% drop from current levels if this move pans out. He even added that not only has Bitcoin fallen below a flag, \u201cbut we are [also] close to completing the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top \u2026 that projects a collapse below $2,000.\u201d", "description": "Despite the harrowing price drop seen in late September, institutions are expecting for the Bitcoin (BTC) price to soon head higher \u2014 at least for", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_160968266-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
