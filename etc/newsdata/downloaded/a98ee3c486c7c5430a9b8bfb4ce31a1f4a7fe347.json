News Conference shortly with @VP and @SecPompeo. Thank you to @RTErdogan. Millions of lives will be saved! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2019\n\nLater on Thursday, Trump told reporters in Washington that he was \"very happy\" with the deal, saying that the agreement will prevent the loss of \"millions and millions of lives\", adding: \"This is an amazing outcome.\"\n\nThe safe zone is to be primarily enforced by the Turkish military, and the two sides will increase their cooperation to implement the deal.\n\nOnce the military operation is suspended, Trump will lift the sanctions that he imposed on Turkey earlier this week.\n\nThe agreement also stipulates that the White House will work with Congress - which has been engaged in efforts to impose sanctions on Turkey - to highlight the progress of the deal.\n\nThe top Democrats in Congress, however, called the agreement a \"sham\", saying that it gave Turkey everything while taking no concessions from Ankara.\n\nOn Thursday, a spokesperson for Lindsey Graham said the Republican senator would not drop efforts to impose additional sanctions on Turkey.\n\n'We got what we wanted'\n\nThe agreement stipulates that Kurdish militants, including the People's Protection Units (YPG), would have their heavy weapons collected and their fortifications and fighting positions disabled.\n\n\"We got exactly what we wanted out of the meeting,\" a senior Turkish official told MEE.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu echoed the official's comment.\n\n\"We got what we wanted. This is not a ceasefire. We only halt our operations,\" he said.\n\nThe Turkish operation, dubbed Peace Spring, will be completely suspended once the YPG completes its withdrawal, Pence said.\n\nHe added that Ankara would commit to a \"permanent ceasefire\" when the agreement is fully implemented.\n\nTrump ally will push for sanctions on Turkey despite Syria agreement: Spokesperson Read More \u00bb\n\nThe US-backed, Kurdish-led Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) played a major role in defeating the Islamic State (IS) group.\n\nAnkara, however, views the YPG, which is a major faction in the SDF, as a threat to its national security.\n\nTrump pulled US troops from northern Syria last week, effectively giving Turkey the green light to carry its military offensive against Syrian Kurds.\n\nTrump's decision proved to be wildly unpopular at home, with politicians from both major parties rebuking him, prompting him earlier this week to call on Turkey to end the incursion and to impose economic sanctions on Ankara.\n\nJoint statement\n\nA joint statement outlining Thursday's agreement, composed of 13 points, starts by reaffirming the strong alliance between Washington and Ankara.\n\n\"The US and Turkey reaffirm their relationship as fellow members of NATO,\" it reads. \"The US understands Turkey\u2019s legitimate security concerns on Turkey\u2019s southern border.\"\n\nThe pact also says that the US and Turkey will coordinate on anti-Islamic State efforts, including maintaining the security of detention facilities that house IS militants.\n\n'The US understands Turkey\u2019s legitimate security concerns on Turkey\u2019s southern border' - Joint US-Turkish statement\n\n\"The two countries reiterate their pledge to uphold human life, human rights, and the protection of religious and ethnic communities,\" it says.\n\nThe document states that Turkey has agreed to exercise \"maximum care\" to protect civilians in the safe zone.\n\n\"The two sides agreed on the continued importance and functionality of the safe zone in order to address the national security concerns of Turkey, to include the re-collection of YPG heavy weapons and the disablement of their fortifications and all other fighting positions,\" it says.\n\nQuestions remain\n\nIt remains unclear who will implement the deal in the absence of US troops, or whether the Syrian government, whose forces have been deployed to many border towns, will accept the agreement.\n\nJoe Macaron, a fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC, said the deal offers a \"face-saving outcome\" to Erdogan and Trump.\n\nThe announcement today is being portrayed as a victory. It is far from a victory - Mitt Romney, US Senator\n\n\"However, this agreement is not binding for either Russia or the Kurdish fighters,\" Macaron told MEE in an email.\n\n\"We are already seeing different interpretations of the agreement from the US, Turkish and Kurdish sides, including when it comes to the length of the 'safe zone' along the Syrian border that Kurdish fighters are supposed to retreat from in the next five days.\"\n\nMitt Romney, a Republican senator, also cast doubt over the viability of the deal.\n\n\"The announcement today is being portrayed as a victory. It is far from a victory,\" he said, adding that serious questions remain over Trump's decision to withdraw American soldiers from northern Syria.\n\nTrump says Turkey's Syria offensive 'not our problem', PKK worse than Islamic State Read More \u00bb\n\nWladimir van Wilgenburg, a political analyst specialising in Kurdish issues, said the SDF is open to a ceasefire, but certain territorial disputes could become a major issue in the implementation of the agreement.\n\n\"The SDF is accepting the ceasefire, but we have to see if they accept Turkish demands to take Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain without a fight,\" van Wilgenburg said.\n\nThe Turkish army has already captured the town of Tal Abyad, but has yet to fully take control over Ras al-Ain, which has a mixed population of Kurds and Arabs, he said.\n\n\"So we will have to see. But in general, SDF prefers peace over fighting,\" van Wilgenburg, who recently co-authored a book titled Kurds of Northern Syria: Governance, Diversity and Conflicts, told MEE.\n\n- Additional reporting by MEE staff in Washington\n\nThis article is available in French on Middle East Eye French edition.", "description": "Halt in fighting within five days would allow Kurdish fighters to withdraw from designated 'safe zone' along Turkish border", "authors": ["Marco Carnelos"], "top_image": "http://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/images-story/erdogan_pence_reuters.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
