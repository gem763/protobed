The Chicago 7: (L-R) Abbie Hoffman, John Froines, Lee Weiner, David Dellinger Rennie Davis, and Tom Hayden, Jerry Rubin pictured in October 1969) The Chicago 7 consisted of defendants and activists Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, John Froines, and Lee Weiner. The group played an active role in the fight against war, particularly the Vietnam War, and often held protests to promote their beliefs. Abbie (1936 \u2013 1989) and Jerry (1938 \u2013 1994) were founders of the Youth International Party (Yippies), David (1915 \u2013 2004) was a member of the National Mobilization Committee (NMC), Rennie (1941) and Tom (1939 \u2013 2016) were part of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), while Lee (1939) and John (1939) also took part in promoting social values. The group were first named the Chicago 8, but Black Panther founder Bobby Seale (1936) had his trial severed during the proceedings. The seven defendants were indicted on charges of conspiracy to incite a riot at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago and plead not guilty in March 1969. The trial - presided over by Judge Julius Hoffman - for the activists began in September 1969, with attorneys William Kunstler and Leonard Weinglass representing the group. Chicago 7's trial saw the activists even promote their beliefs - including racism and oppression - in court. Hoffman found the defendants and their attorneys guilty of 175 counts of contempt of court and sentenced them to terms ranging from two to four years, but were acquitted of conspiracy in February 1970. The jury declared all but John and Lee guilty of intent to riot, with the others sentenced to five years and fined $5,000. Despite the verdict, none of the defendants ended up serving time in prison as a Court of Appeal overturned the criminal convictions in 1972. Most of the contempt charges were later dropped.\n\nThe group were originally named the Chicago 8, but Black Panther founder Bobby Seale had his trial severed during the proceedings.\n\nFollowing a trial - which began on September 1969 and consisted of acquittals, convictions, appeals, and reversals, all of the defendants were acquitted of conspiracy.\n\nCo-founder of the Youth International Party, Abbie played an active role in promoting the civil rights movement between the 50s and 60s, before turning his attention to protesting against American's political system and the Vietnam War.\n\nThe revolutionary - who was also involved in the Flower Power movement - was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1980 and committed suicide by a phenobarbital overdose at 52 in April 1989.\n\nAaron's film will be distributed by Paramount Pictures, while Cross Creek president Tyler Thompson, Stuart Besser and Matt Jackson serve as the project's producers.\n\nOn the movie, playwright Aaron said: 'I\u2019m thrilled to be making a movie about one of one of the craziest, funniest, most intense, most tragic and most triumphant trials in American history.\n\n'C-7 may take place in the late \u201960\u2019s, but there\u2019s no better time to tell this story than today.'\n\nThe film was temporarily shut down by Amblin Entertainment in the pre-production phase last year, insiders told Variety.\n\nUpcoming: The actor was pictured channelling the anarchist for the first time on the set of the drama, which does not yet have a release date scheduled\n\nA-list cast: The Trial of the Chicago 7 will see screen star Eddie Redmayne (pictured left earlier this month) portray Tom (pictured right in 1969)\n\nLookalike?
