REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\n\n(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) said on Monday its deal-making unit is gaining momentum with midsized companies as it focuses on the sector to regain market share.\n\nRevenue from the middle market grew by 17% in the first seven months of the year. For the third quarter the bank estimated overall investment banking revenue to be up in the low single digits.\n\nBank of America, the second largest U.S. bank by assets, is focusing more on middle market clients and private companies following a turbulent year marked by falling revenue and market share and after a string of departures by senior leaders.\n\nInvestment banking income tumbled 11% last year.\n\n\u201cWe had fallen too far,\u201d Chief Operating Officer Tom Montag told analysts and investors at the Barclays Financial Services Conference. Taking advantage of the bank\u2019s broad network to reach more clients can help close the gap, he said.\n\nThe bank is also working with a longer list of private equity firms, hedge funds and other financial sponsors.\n\n\u201cWe were more focused on the top 100,\u201d he said at the Barclays Financial Services Conference. \u201cWe\u2019re now going 400-deep.\u201d\n\nThe number of merger and acquisition referrals coming from its wealth business has surged 67% so far this year as the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank is increasingly relying on that division to drum up business, he added.", "description": "Bank of America Corp said on Monday its deal-making unit is gaining momentum with midsized companies as it focuses on the sector to regain market share.", "authors": ["Imani Moise", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428078694&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881RE", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
