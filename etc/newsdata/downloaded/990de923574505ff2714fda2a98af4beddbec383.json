Meanwhile, the often-overlooked Ethereum Classic appears to have big plans of its own, like perhaps taking over from ETH 1.0. Some have even suggested that this was the plan from the start.\n\nFrom The Domain Of Ethereum Purists\u2026\n\nEthereum Classic emerged in 2016 following a contentious hard fork of the ETH network. The forking majority supported a rollback of the Ethereum blockchain, to reverse the damage done by a major hack on the DAO project.\n\nA minority of purists opposed this rollback as being against everything that blockchain immutability stood for. Thus, Ethereum Classic was born, building on the original blockchain.\n\nAnd there it might have stayed, as a curio, existing for conservative blockchainers and die-hard Ethereum purists. If that is, ETH hadn\u2019t since undergone so much development as to change beyond recognition.\n\nTo Flavour Of The Month?\n\nThe roadmap to ETH 2.0 was unveiled exactly a year ago, bringing \u2018advances\u2019 such as sharding and a transition to Proof-of-Stake.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum Classic developers have been slowly implementing the upgrades which will take the cryptocurrency to the pre-ETH 2.0 state. Whilst the ETH 2.0 upgrade is likely to make its own version of ETH 1.0 redundant, Ethereum Classic is positioning itself to step into the gap.\n\nSome think ETC might even seek to remerge the chains and keep all of the Decentralised Finance (DeFi) apps alive. This might not be as outlandish a suggestion as it seems.\n\nIn addition, Binance has certainly thrown some weight behind Ethereum Classic in recent weeks, as ETC has been present in all three phases of its crypto-lending product.\n\nOne satirical observer even suggested that this had been the plan from the start, and the DAO hack was an inside job to deliberately create a \u2018conservative\u2019 backup version of the \u2018progressive\u2019 ETH 2.0?\n\nOkay, so it was clearly a joke, but us crypto-kids do love a good conspiracy theory.\n\nWhat does the future hold for Ethereum Classic?
