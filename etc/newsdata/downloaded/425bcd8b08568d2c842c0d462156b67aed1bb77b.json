No more having to read about crazy tantrums over a helmet. No distraction of a diva receiver skipping meetings and walkthroughs. Nobody left who would interrupt practice to cuss out the general manager.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nAntonio Brown is gone before he ever played a snap with the Raiders, and while it\u2019s hard to say the Raiders are more talented without him, they also didn\u2019t miss him on Monday night.\n\nOakland played very well on Monday night in a 24-16 win over the Denver Broncos. For weeks, the only thing the Raiders heard about was Brown and his constant drama. It must have been nice to just play ball.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get the elephant out the room,\u201d quarterback Derek Carr told ESPN\u2019s Dianna Russini postgame. \u201cAntonio is no longer with us and we love Antonio. We wish him the best. But we knew with the guys we have in our locker room, we already had a good football team. And if he wanted to be part of it, awesome. If he didn\u2019t, awesome.\u201d\n\nOakland Raiders quarterback Derek Carr had a big game in a win over the Broncos. (AP)\n\nRaiders offense has a strong night\n\nThe biggest positive on Monday was that Carr played very well without Brown, who was supposed to be his All-Pro target all season. Carr was very efficient, spreading the ball around. He was 22-of-25 for 259 yards. Carr also played well in the second half of last season, though not too many people noticed after he stumbled early in the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nTyrell Williiams, another offseason addition who moves up to be the team\u2019s No. 1 receiver with Brown off to New England, scored early and looked like he could do just fine as Carr\u2019s new favorite target. Williams had six catches for 105 yards. Tight end Darren Waller was tough to match up with. Rookie running back Josh Jacobs made big plays, and became the first player in his NFL debut to have 100 total yards and two touchdowns since LaDainian Tomlinson in 2001.\n\nIt was just one game, and we\u2019ve seen weird outcomes in the second Monday night game of Week 1 before, but the Raiders looked like a team that has improved a lot, even with Brown having sabotaged his Oakland career before it started.\n\nFor the Raiders who were overshadowed by the sideshow, the coaching staff and front office who had to babysit Brown\u2019s drama and even the fans who felt betrayed by Brown (and broke out an explicit chant to voice their feelings), it had to feel pretty good to play that well on Monday night without him.\n\nOakland dominates Denver\n\nThe Raiders were the better team from beginning to end. They took an early 7-0 lead on a Williams touchdown and Denver was never really in the game after that.\n\nOakland\u2019s defense, which was not good last season, was stifling. The Raiders upgraded in a few spots and looked strong against the Arizona Cardinals in the preseason. The preseason generally means little, but that was a preview of what happened on Monday night. Denver didn\u2019t get in the end zone until 2:15 remained against a new-look Raiders defense. There will be some important questions about how the Broncos could look so bad in the season opener, but that\u2019s for another day.\n\nMonday night was for the Raiders, who have been beat up a lot since Jon Gruden came back to coach them. There were no jokes to be made about them after they controlled the Broncos. Maybe AB can post about that on social media.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
