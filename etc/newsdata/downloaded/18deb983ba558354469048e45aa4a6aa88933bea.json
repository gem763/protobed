GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares advance on U.S.-China trade hopes, ECB stimulus\n\n* Ex-Japan Asia MSCI up 0.16%, Nikkei gains 0.42%\n\n* S&P 500 near record peak hit in late July\n\n* Euro, bonds lose steam on profit-taking after ECB\n\n* Asian stock markets: https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\nBy Hideyuki Sano\n\nTOKYO, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Asian stocks advanced on Friday\n\nas hints of progress in the U.S.-China trade dispute and\n\naggressive stimulus from the European Central Bank helped to\n\ncounter worries about a global economic slowdown.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\nticked up 0.2%, while Japan's Nikkei\n\nrose 0.4%.\n\nSentiment was also supported by U.S. President Donald\n\nTrump's announcement that his administration would unveil a tax\n\noverhaul plan aimed at middle-income households next\n\nyear.\n\n\"Risk assets should find further support from accommodative\n\npolicies, which are set to remain in vogue for some time, and\n\nnot just in Europe as seen in the global easing trend,\" said\n\nEsty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis.\n\n\"Nonetheless, we believe that trade uncertainty and growth\n\nconcerns will not vanish, so any reprieve on either subject will\n\nbe welcome. We also believe that some earnings growth will be\n\nneeded for equities to grind higher,\" she said.\n\nAlthough conflicting reports on Thursday about whether Trump\n\nadministration officials had considered offering a limited trade\n\ndeal to China made U.S. markets choppy, investors overall were\n\nsticking to hopes of more progress in upcoming talks.\n\nThe United States on Thursday welcomed China's renewed\n\npurchases of U.S. farm goods while maintaining the threat of\n\nU.S. tariff hikes as the world's two largest economies prepared\n\nthe ground for talks aimed at breaking the logjam in their trade\n\nwar. Trump said he preferred a comprehensive trade deal with\n\nChina but did not rule out the possibility of an interim pact,\n\neven as he said an \"easy\" agreement would not be\n\npossible. Most economists in a new Reuters poll believed the trade\n\ndispute will worsen or at best stay the same over the coming\n\nyear. The U.S. S&P 500 closed within striking distance of its\n\nall-time closing high, rising 0.29% to 3,009.57, near record\n\nclosing high of 3,024.50 marked in late July. .N\n\nPhiladelphia semiconductor shares index hit an\n\nall-time high while MSCI ACWI also came near\n\nthis year's high after seven straight days of gains by Thursday.\n\nThe European Central Bank delivered bigger-than-expected\n\nstimulus, cutting interest rates by 0.10 percentage point to\n\nminus 0.50 percent, promising that rates would stay low for\n\nlonger and restarting bond purchases of 20 billion euros a month\n\nfrom November. The resumption of quantitative easing had been seen as a\n\nclose call and helped to boost risk assets.\n\nBut the euro quickly lost steam and European bond yields\n\nalso rose as profit-taking set in.\n\nECB President Mario Draghi stepped up his rhetoric in\n\ncalling for governments to spend their way out of a slowdown,\n\nhighlighting the limitations of monetary policy and also fanning\n\nexpectations of fiscal spending down the road.\n\nThe euro stood at $1.10615 , having risen 0.5 percent\n\non Thursday and staying near two-week high of $1.10875 hit in\n\nU.S. trade.\n\nRising risk appetite pushed the yen down to 108.15 yen per\n\ndollar . It hit a six-week low of 108.19 on Thursday.\n\nThe 10-year German Bund yields also rose back to minus\n\n0.521% .\n\nThat also helped to lift the yield on 10-year U.S.\n\nTreasuries to as high as 1.081 percent , its highest\n\nlevel since early August.\n\nFed funds rate futures 0#FF: price in an interest rate cut\n\nof 0.25 percentage point by the Fed next week but have\n\neffectively priced out any chance of a larger cut.\n\nThe Fed will announce its policy on Wednesday, followed by\n\nthe Bank of Japan (BOJ) on Thursday.\n\nSources told Reuters the BOJ is leaning towards standing pat\n\nnext week if markets are calm, but is brainstorming ways to\n\ndeepen negative interest rates at minimal cost. \"I think a rally in stock prices will run out of steam soon.\n\nIt's typical buy-on-rumour-sell-on-fact trade on central bank\n\nstimulus and will be over by the Fed and the BOJ's meetings,\"\n\nsaid Tatsushi Maeno, senior strategist at Okasan Asset\n\nManagement.\n\n\"People also seem to think there will be a deal between\n\nChina and the States soon but you never know when suddenly Trump\n\ndo about-face. We just saw that in May and August,\" he added.\n\nOil prices were softer as a meeting of the OPEC+ alliance\n\nyielded no decision on deepening crude supply cuts.\n\nBrent crude futures fell 0.2% to $60.29 a barrel\n\nwhile U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude lost 0.2%\n\nto $54.96.\n\n(Editing by Kim Coghill)", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares advance on U.S.-China trade hopes, ECB stimulus", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE020QH_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
