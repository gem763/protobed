The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said in March that the trade in waste materials will continue after the U.K. leaves the bloc \u2014 deals have been secured with EU countries to maintain all the U.K.\u2019s notified waste shipments in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe Netherlands is the largest importer of U.K. waste, receiving 1.3 million tons of British garbage in 2018 \u2014 almost half the country's total trash exports.\n\nBut that doesn't mean there are no worries outstanding.\n\nWaste operators say they\u2019re still concerned that exports of waste will be physically halted or delayed by port congestion following a no-deal Brexit. With 15 percent of the waste that the U.K. sends to the EU moving through the port of Dover, changes and disruptions to border controls may cause significant backlogs.\n\n\u201cResidual waste going to the EU cannot be stored for too long,\u201d said Jakob Rindegren of the U.K. Environmental Services Association, an industry lobby. With limited sites in the U.K. to deal with this garbage, rubbish from the more densely populated southeast could also be sent to landfills in northern England, he said.\n\nRindegren said the waste lobby is advising its member organizations to find \u201calternative routes\u201d and look at \u201cdifferent port options.\u201d\n\nGarbage complications\n\nThen there\u2019s the change of heart happening in the Netherlands, prompted by the country\u2019s own environmental crisis.\n\nSlashing garbage imports is one of 18 measures announced by the Dutch government in light of a 2015 court ruling finding it wasn\u2019t doing enough to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The court ordered the government to reduce emissions by 25 percent by 2020, compared with the government\u2019s own program of a more modest 17 percent reduction.\n\nThe result is the trash tax proposal, which would add charges of \u20ac32 per ton of imports from January 1, 2020.\n\nThe Netherlands is the largest importer of U.K. waste, receiving 1.3 million tons of British garbage in 2018 \u2014 almost half the country's total trash exports. In an average week, that's about 25,000 tons of waste, or a truckload every 15 minutes.\n\n\u201cThe introduction of an import tax risks more waste going to landfill in the U.K. each year,\u201d Robert Corijn, chair of the RDF Industry Group that represents incineration plant operators, waste trade associations and exporters, said earlier this year. According to the lobby, the tax would distort the market and force waste-to-energy plant operators to lower prices \u2014 making it cheaper to dump trash in landfills.\n\nIn the Netherlands, burning less waste for fuel will help cut emissions \u2014 making the court-ordered target easier to reach.\n\nBut any gain in carbon dioxide reductions in the Netherlands would be more than offset by methane emissions if that same garbage ends up in landfills in the U.K. Methane, which is released by rotting waste, is a more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2.\n\nThe U.K. government has said that even after Brexit, it will respect stringent new EU regulations setting a limit of only 10 percent of household waste going to landfill by 2035. Currently around 20 percent is sent to landfill (down from 80 percent in 2001).\n\nThat promise could be difficult to square with the likely surge of garbage trapped in the country.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s Sustainability Pro service, which dives deep into sustainability issues across all sectors, including: circular economy, waste and the plastics strategy, chemicals and more.
