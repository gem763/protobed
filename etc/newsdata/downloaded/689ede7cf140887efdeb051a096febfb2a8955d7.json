Pictured: Sealy, left, and Gentile\n\nSealy first noticed a lump in her breast during a self-exam in January 2017, but assumed it was a problem with her implants.\n\nAfter she found another lump, she decided to make a doctor's appointment and was diagnosed with breast cancer that same month.\n\nBreast cancer is currently the number one killer of women between the ages of 20 and 59 in the US.\n\nOne out of every eight American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during her lifetime, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nMore than 268,000 cases are expected to be diagnosed in 2019 and more than 41,700 people are predicted to die of the disease.\n\nOnly about two percent of women under-40 are expected to be diagnosed.\n\nSealy was diagnosed with breast cancer in January 2017. She had both breasts removed (pictured, in the hospital), but learned her cancer had progressed to stage IV after tumors were found in her hip and spine\n\nIt is the second leading cause of cancer death in women, behind lung cancer. Breast cancer does also occur in men but the incidence rate is less than one percent.\n\nThe Inquirer reported that Sealy underwent a double mastectomy, a medical procedure in which both breasts are surgically removed.\n\nHowever, despite this preventive effort, doctors discovered tumors on her right hip and on her spine.\n\nSimilarly, Gentile, a mother-of-three, first discovered her lump in May 2017 as she put on her bra to get dressed for work, reported the Inquirer.\n\nHer OBGYN assumed it was just a clogged milk duct from breastfeeding her seven-month-old son but recommended she get checked out.\n\nShe was referred to a surgeon who performed a biopsy and soon after diagnosed her with stage III breast cancer.\n\nPregnant with her third child at the time, Gentile underwent a lumpectomy, a surgical procedure to remove the lump of cancerous tissue from her breast, and chemotherapy.\n\nAfter she gave birth, she underwent 36 rounds of radiation, according to the Inquirer.\n\nLast summer, after experiencing back pain, Gentile's doctors discovered that the cancer had spread to her spine, meaning her cancer was now stage IV.\n\nGentile was diagnosed with stage III breast cancer while she was pregnant with her third child in May 2017 and underwent a lumpectomy. Pictured: Gentile, second from the right, with her husband and three children\n\nShe felt pain in her back in 2018 and went to the doctor, who told her the cancer was now stage IV after spreading to her spine. Pictured: Gentile after a session of radiation\n\n'The most common areas that [cancer] spreads to after it goes to your lymph nodes are bones, brains, liver, and lung,' Sealy told the newspaper.\n\n'[Doctors] keeping an eye on something on a lung for [Gentile] and a liver for me. I had a spot on my sternum. It could be anything.'\n\nThe two women say they met through friends and immediately felt a connection and similarities in their health journeys.\n\nThey decided to start a podcast, which they aptly named Making the Breast of It, to encourage other women to get self-exams and to motivate others undergoing similar health struggles.\n\nThe show launched on September 29 and releases new episodes every Wednesday.\n\n'We want to use the platform to tell people that life is short,' Gentile told the Inquirer.\n\n'Live your life the way you want to live it. Stop caring about what other people think. Be you. I was worried about what other people thought. That's out the window.'", "description": "Andy Sealy, 39, and Krysten Gentile, 37, from Pennsylvania, were both diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer and have launched a podcast together called Making the Breast of It.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/22/19760388-0-image-a-50_1571174468502.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
