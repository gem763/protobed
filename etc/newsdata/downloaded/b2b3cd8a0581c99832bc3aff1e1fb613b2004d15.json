But the Federal Reserve sees things a little differently.\n\nOn Wednesday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell instead said that low inflation can create problems for the U.S. economy, calling it one of the \u201clonger-term challenges\u201d facing the United States.\n\nIn a speech in Kansas City, Missouri, Powell also acknowledged that such a view might be confounding to many Americans: \u201cYou may be asking, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with low inflation and low interest rates?'\u201d he said.\n\nThe question highlights a problem for the Fed: It is struggling to get inflation closer to its 2% target, but also has to explain to the public why it wants to push inflation higher. Fed policymakers are also divided over how important it is to accelerate price gains, given that inflation is currently at 1.8%, according to the Fed\u2019s preferred measure, not far from its objective.\n\nThe Fed targets 2% inflation as a cushion against deflation, a destabilizing fall in prices and wages that can cause a recession.\n\nEsther George, president of the Kansas City Fed, voted against the Fed\u2019s cut in short-term interest rates last month, which lowered its benchmark to a range between 1.75% and 2%. It was the second rate cut this year. She said earlier this week that she isn\u2019t concerned by inflation that is just a few tenths of a percent below target.\n\n\u201cI hear few complaints about inflation being too low,\u201d George said. \u201cIn fact, I am more likely to hear disbelief when I mention that inflation is as low as measured in a number of key sectors.\u201d\n\nMany American consumers, George said, see health care costs, rents and food prices rising and \u201cdon\u2019t understand why the Fed would be concerned that inflation is too low.\u201d\n\nBusinesses also feel they are facing higher costs, George added, mostly in the form of higher wages and salaries, narrowing their profit margins.\n\nPowell and many other Fed officials, however, worry that low inflation makes it harder to raise interest rates, which then gives the Fed much less room to maneuver when the economy slows.\n\nOn Tuesday, Powell said at an economics conference in Denver that the Fed wants to avoid the same disinflation trends that are occurring in Japan and Europe.\n\nConsumer prices rose just 0.2% in Japan in August from a year earlier, according to data provider FactSet, and only 0.9% in September compared with a year ago in the nations that use the euro currency.\n\nPowell said he wants inflation centered at 2% to keep Americans from expecting inflation to fall even lower. Inflation expectations can be self-fulfilling: If companies expect slower price gains, for example, they may offer smaller raises.\n\nIn Japan and Europe, \u201cYou see inflation moving down, expectations move down \u2026 and it\u2019s been very, very hard for economies to get off that road once they\u2019re on it,\u201d Powell said on Tuesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get on that road.\u201d\n\nStill, it has been difficult explaining these concerns to the general public, Powell said.\n\nThey \u201cdon\u2019t really care whether inflation is 1.7% or 2%,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Thomas Peipert contributed to this story from Denver.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 When out shopping, most Americans like lower prices.
