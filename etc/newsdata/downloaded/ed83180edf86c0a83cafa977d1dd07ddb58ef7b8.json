REUTERS/Nigel Roddis/File Photo\n\nThe company had suspended the bond issue in August, citing adverse market conditions, but said it would try again if the market for high-risk bonds stabilised.\n\nOn Tuesday it said that the government had declined to provide support for financing of the mining project and it would now conduct a six-month review of its plan.\n\n\u201cThis is the most prudent decision to give the company the time necessary to restructure its plans to move the project forward,\u201d CEO Chris Fraser said, adding one option was to seek \u201ca major strategic partner\u201d.\n\nSirius\u2019 shares were trading 55% lower by 0730 GMT.\n\nThe plan would be Britain\u2019s biggest mining project and holds hopes of creating jobs in a part of the country that has felt left behind with the decline of heavy industry.\n\nMany local people are retail investors in the project, which involves tunnelling miles under the North York Moors and aims to exploit what Sirius says is the world\u2019s largest deposit of polyhalite, a multi-nutrient fertiliser.\n\nThe substance is meant to be superior to traditional potash, but both equity and bond investors have voiced concerns the market for polyhalite is not well established.\n\nSirius said its cash reserves of 180 million pounds as of the end of August provide liquidity for it to explore all strategic options.\n\nThe company needed to issue a bond of at least $500 million to gain full access to a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility from JP Morgan Chase.\n\nIt said discussions were paused with the British government in early 2019, but it re-engaged with the government in August, when it asked for a commitment to provide up to $1 billion in government bonds.\n\nThe government decided not to provide the support requested, it said. The government was not available for immediate comment.\n\nSirius says it has offtake contracts with customers in the United States, Europe, Brazil, India and Africa.\n\nApart from uncertainty over Britain\u2019s relations with Europe, investor appetite for risk has been hit by uncertainty over the global economy and trade tensions between the United States and China.\n\nSirius Minerals on Tuesday reported an operating loss of 14.3 million pounds for the six months ended June 30 versus a loss of 10.8 million pounds a year earlier.", "description": "Sirius Minerals scrapped a plan to raise $500 million (\u00a3402 million) through a bond sale, sending its shares more than 50% lower and delaying a project to mine for fertiliser under a national park in northern England.", "authors": ["Barbara Lewis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430765029&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0KI", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
