Stock image (right)\n\nA mother \u2018alienated\u2019 her children from their father in a case a judge described as \u2018heartbreaking.\u2019\n\nJudge Stephen Wildblood said the children would suffer \u2018significant and long-term emotional harm\u2019 and the fault \u2018lies squarely with this mother.\u2019\n\nA court heard the father was an intelligent and loving parent who had done absolutely nothing wrong.\n\nBut his former wife had \u2018demonised\u2019 him to such an extent that his children now refused to have anything to do with him or his family.\n\nAs such, he has now ended an eight-year legal fight to get contact with them.\n\nThe family cannot be named for legal reasons but Judge Wildblood said the public needed to know about the case.\n\nHe said it was an example of \u2018how badly wrong things can go\u2019 and of how complicated cases can be when one parent alienates children from the other parent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe judge said the man was intelligent and \u2018plainly\u2019 loved his children.\n\nHe added: \u2018No professional has suggested that there is anything about this father that renders him unsuited to have contact with his children.\n\n\u2018There have been consistent recommendations throughout the eight-year history of these proceedings from a wide spectrum of professionals that contact should take place between the father and the children.\n\n\u2018All professionals involved in this case have concluded that the mother has alienated the children from the father.\u2019\n\nJudge Stephen Wildblood said people had a right to know about the case (Picture: familycourtinfo.org.uk)\n\nJudge Wildblood said the children would have nothing to do with their father or his family.\n\nThey would not acknowledge cards or presents, expressed \u2018unjustified and illogical\u2019 complaints about his letters, and had \u2018false memories\u2019 of how he had behaved towards them.\n\nThe judge, who oversees cases in the West Country, said it was \u2018beyond doubt\u2019 that the children would suffer significantly because of the mother\u2019s actions.\n\nHe added: \u2018Whatever may be her difficulties, she is an adult and a parent with parental responsibility for her children.\n\n\u2018That parental responsibility, which she shares with the father, requires her to act in the best interests of her children.\n\n\u2018It also required her to promote the relationship between these children and their father.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018She has failed to do so.\u2019\n\nJudge Wildblood ended his ruling with a message to the father, saying: \u2018This has been a long, heart-breaking and expensive set of events for you to endure. I am truly sorry.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA judge at London\u2019s High Court recently ruled that a 12-year-old boy had to go and live with his father.\n\nMr Justice Keehan said the woman had \u2018alienated\u2019 the boy from her ex-husband and he had suffered \u2018emotional and social harm\u2019 because of his father\u2019s absence.", "description": "The judge said it was 'beyond doubt' that the actions of the dad's former partner meant their children would suffer 'significant and long-term emotional harm'.", "authors": ["Jane Wharton"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91451089_1571824779.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
