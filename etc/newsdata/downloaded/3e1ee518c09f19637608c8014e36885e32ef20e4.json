UK Parliament / Jessica Taylor\n\nDoubts among Conservative MPs about Johnson's strategy grew after Parliament voted on Wednesday to approve a bill proposed by Labour MP Hillary Benn which would force the prime minister to seek a Brexit delay until January 31 if he is unable to secure a deal before the middle of October.\n\nWhile Brexit-backing Conservative peers initially tried to disrupt the bill's passage through the House of Lords, the government was forced to accept that their attempts had failed and an agreement struck between all sides in the early morning meant that it should pass through the chamber by Friday afternoon, where it will return to the Commons before receiving approval.\n\nWhile there are still some fears among the rebels that Downing Street could try and renege on its commitment to let the bill pass, it appears all but certain that the legislation will be forced through.\n\nIt represents a significant victory for opposition MPs and the handful of formerly Conservative MPs who were kicked out of the party for supporting the plan.\n\nThe group was determined to prevent Johnson from forcing a no-deal Brexit without the consent of parliament on October \u2014 which he had repeatedly threatened \u2014 and he now appears certain to be required to seek a delay then if he is still in office.\n\nOne senior minister suggested that Johnson would resign as prime minister rather than request a delay.\n\n\"Make no mistake. The prime minister will resign,\" the minister told the Times.\n\nJohnson's election bid in doubt\n\nGetty Johnson's response to the bill's passage through the Commons earlier was to call again for a general election, with Downing Street insisting that blocking no-deal had wrecked the UK's negotiating position with the EU.\n\nHowever, Labour MPs, who are wary of a trap and of agreeing to a snap poll on Johnson's terms failed to vote in favour of the election motion, meaning it was rejected.\n\nA Downing Street source indicated that the government would ask parliament again next week to approve an October 15 election.\n\n\"If Labour's position is that they're just waiting for the bill to get sent, the most straightforward route is to bring back the FTPA [election vote] next week,\" the source said.\n\nHowever, Labour signaled that it could seek to delay the election until November.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn indicated that he favours an early snap election, but other MPs \u2014 including shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer \u2014 think Labour should force one after Johnson has been forced to delay Brexit beyond October 31.\n\nFollowing a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party on Monday, Ben Bradshaw, the Labour MP for Exeter, said it was the \"unanimous view\" of his colleagues that they \"won't vote for a pre-November election.\"\n\nHis stance appears to be backed by Keir Starmer, who told the meeting that \"the bill has to be implemented, not just passed, before a general election,\" according to a PoliticsHome report.\n\nJohn McDonnell, the shadow chancellor and Corbyn's key ally, also indicated that they may not back an October 15 election, saying that Labour was still considering \"a range of options.\"", "description": "Boris Johnson's plan to win an early election then take Britain out of the EU has been thrown into chaos after a series of parliamentary defeats.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson", "Adam Bienkov"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d70d2062e22af69c0609fe7-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
