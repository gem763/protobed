It is a disposal method that generates educational material for audiences dominated by children, in a country home to a strong tradition of shadow puppetry, known as wayang kulit.\n\nMost of the puppeteers are aged from about seven to 16. They collect and sort through waste from their own neighbourhoods, washing plastic containers and painting faces on paper cups, before assembling the figures using bamboo sticks.\n\nLatief also hoped children among the audience would pick up the lesson not to litter, saying people should be taught to care for the environment when young.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\n\u201cFor us, this is fun and we hope this can benefit many people and have an impact on our environment, the world\u2019s environment,\u201d said a plastic puppet artist, Fitri Rachmawati.\n\nIndonesia has been struggling to cope with the waste it produces, much of which goes into landfills and often seeps into rivers and oceans.\n\nThe sprawling Southeast Asian archipelago was the world\u2019s second-biggest contributor of plastic pollutants in the oceans, a 2015 study in the journal Science showed.", "description": "The scene is much like any other Indonesian puppet show: the beat of the gongs is frenetic, the musicians wear intricately-patterned traditional costumes and the puppets sway back and forth in a fast-paced exchange laced with maniacal laughter.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445663675&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R00I", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
