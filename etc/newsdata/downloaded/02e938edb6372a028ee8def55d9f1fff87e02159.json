USA TODAY\n\nSTUTTGART, Germany \u2014 Simone Biles often says she\u2019s not motivated by medals.\n\nExcept for one.\n\nBiles won the bronze medal on balance beam at the Rio Olympics and, three years later, it has stayed with her. Only this year does she feel she has regained her confidence on the event.\n\n\u201cIt took a while,\u201d she said Friday during an exclusive interview with USA TODAY Sports. \u201cI have this love-hate relationship with the beam. I\u2019ve always told myself, 'If you hate beam, the beam will hate you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSimone Biles was the world champion on balance beam in 2014 and 2015 but struggled in 2016 and has now regained her form. (Photo: Matthias Schrader, AP)\n\nBiles was the world champion on balance beam in 2014 and 2015, and she was expected to win gold on it in Rio after finishing first in qualifying. But her foot slipped on the landing of a front tucked somersault during the event final, and she wobbled and had to grab onto the beam to keep from falling.\n\nSo certain was she that she would finish off the podium that Biles put her regular Team USA warmup on, rather than the special gear U.S. athletes were given to wear on the medals stand. When the competition finished, however, Biles was still in third, slightly ahead of France\u2019s Marine Boyer and Brazil's Flavia Saraiva.\n\nDisappointed as she was at the mistake, some of the reactions she got were even more crushing, with some telling her she didn\u2019t deserve her bronze medal.\n\n\u201c2016 kind of shut me down,\u201d Biles said.\n\nEven the year she took off after Rio couldn\u2019t erase the negative memories.\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t want to do a performance like that. I had fallen on beam (again), so that also shot my confidence down,\u201d said Biles, who won a bronze medal on beam at last year\u2019s worlds after a wobbly performance.\n\n\u201cI was like, 'I guess I\u2019m just never going to do well on beam again.' \"\n\nIt is Cecile Landi, who coaches Biles with her husband Laurent, who helped her find her confidence again. They took out the front tuck, and reworked the routine. Biles also perfected a double-twisting, double somersault dismount \u2013 though she only does it sparingly because the International Gymnastics Federation watered down its value to discourage other, less-capable gymnasts from trying it.\n\nThe change is noticeable. Biles posted the highest score on balance beam in qualifying, team final and the all-around, and she now does her tricks with such assuredness the beam might as well be 4-feet wide instead of 4-inches.\n\n\u201cMy main goal is to go out there and compete beam with confidence, and hopefully do well in that event because I know how strong I am,\u201d Biles said. \u201cEven though I got a bronze, I\u2019m hoping for a little bit better because I know I\u2019m capable of it.\u201d", "description": "Simone Biles won the world title on balance beam in 2014 and 2015, but a mistake at the Rio Olympics rattled her confidence on the event.", "authors": ["Nancy Armour", "Published A.M.
