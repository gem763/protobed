Not just destroyed, it ended up looking like a \u2018lopsided turkey with leprosy\u2019.\n\nRena Davis (the bride) from Griffin, Georgia, paid a baker Rs 21,310 for her ideal peacock-themed celebration cake - featuring two birds, a heart shaped sponge and chocolate cupcakes. Everything went according to plan, that was until it didn't.\n\nKennedy News and Media\n\nAfter the baker left, Rena realised that the icing was actually buttercream - after one of the bird\u2019s heads fell off. And what\u2019s worse than that - the baker refused to offer a refund. Slamming the cake, Rena\u2019s sister-in-law, Annete Hill, wrote:\n\nDon't Miss 9.9 K SHARES 9.2 K SHARES 2.2 K SHARES 4.4 K SHARES 3.8 K SHARES\n\nThe one 'peacock' looks like a turkey with leprosy or something, and the white bird, which isn't white at all, doesn't even have a tail or look like a bird in any way, it's just a brown BLOB!\n\nThere's NOTHING supporting the 'birds' and the cake was already sinking so bad from their weight when it was delivered and it continued to sink worse overnight until the next morning, the day of the wedding, the birds were almost sitting on the bottom layer.\n\nSo, on the morning of her wedding, the bride was going from store to store trying to find a cake that would be suitable to use for her wedding.\n\nThey ultimately had to get two cakes from Walmart - one with purple and green flowers on it, one was triple chocolate and had a tractor on it.\n\nKennedy News And Media\n\nThankfully, the rest of the wedding went well!", "description": "There are so many things that you plan for your wedding day and it is depressing if something goes wrong, because you planned for your wedding day since like forever.
