REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo\n\nTokyo Electric, or Tepco, has collected more than 1 million tonnes of contaminated water from the cooling pipes used to keep fuel cores from melting since the plant was crippled by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011.\n\n\u201cThe only option will be to drain it into the sea and dilute it,\u201d the minister, Yoshiaki Harada, told a news briefing in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cThe whole of the government will discuss this, but I would like to offer my simple opinion.\u201d\n\nThe government is awaiting a report from an expert panel before making a final decision on how to dispose of the radioactive water.\n\nJapan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, in a separate press briefing, described Harada\u2019s comments as \u201chis personal opinion\u201d.\n\nTepco was not in a position to decide what to do but would follow the policy once the government made a decision, a spokesman for the utility said.\n\nThe utility says it will run out of room to store the water by 2022. Harada did not say how much water would need to be dumped into the ocean.\n\nAny green light from the government to dump the waste into the sea would anger neighbors such as South Korea, which summoned a senior Japanese embassy official last month to explain how the Fukushima water would be dealt with.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just hoping to hear more details of the discussions that are under way in Tokyo so that there won\u2019t be a surprise announcement,\u201d a South Korean diplomat told Reuters, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of bilateral ties.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement said it had asked Japan \u201cto take a wise and prudent decision on the issue\u201d.\n\nRelations between the East Asian nations are already frosty following a dispute over compensation for Koreans forced to work in Japanese factories in World War Two.\n\nCoastal nuclear plants commonly dump into the ocean water that contains tritium, an isotope of hydrogen that is hard to separate and is considered to be relatively harmless.\n\nTepco, which also faces opposition from fishermen, admitted last year that the water in its tanks still contained contaminants beside tritium.\n\n\u201cThe government must commit to the only environmentally acceptable option for managing this water crisis which is long term storage and processing to remove radioactivity, including tritium,\u201d Shaun Burnie, senior nuclear specialist with Greenpeace Germany, said in an email.", "description": "Japan's Tokyo Electric Power <9501.T> will have to dump radioactive water from its destroyed Fukushima nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean as it runs out of room to store it, the environment minister said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428230674&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8909Q", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
