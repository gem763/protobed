They supposedly will have noise-cancelling technology built in and will come in as many as eight different colours. Perhaps in order to match up with the recently-released iPhone 11.\n\nThis design appears to reflect images posted on tech site SlashLeaks (pictured above) that allegedly show a prototype version of the new gadgets.\n\nThere\u2019s no mention yet of anything like waterproofing or sweat resistance that might be useful for those who want wireless earphones during exercise. Perhaps because Apple-owned Beats by Dre already offers a product exactly like that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to serial gadget leaker Benjamin Geskin, the tech giant is showing off the products to select media this week and will unveil them officially in the next couple of weeks.\n\nAirPods Pro will be shown next week on Tuesday / Wednesday at an event / session with journalists at Apple's local offices pic.twitter.com/HFLqpHAGkg \u2014 Ben Geskin (@BenGeskin) October 27, 2019\n\nThe current AirPods received an updated charging case back in March, but the earbuds themselves were unchanged.\n\nAlthough they\u2019re on the pricey end of the wireless earbud spectrum, the AirPods have become a massive seller and another hugely popular product for Apple.\n\nIf the AirPods Pro are genuine, then there\u2019s every chance they could be just as successful.", "description": "Like AirPods, but more professional", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88321113_1572274588.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
