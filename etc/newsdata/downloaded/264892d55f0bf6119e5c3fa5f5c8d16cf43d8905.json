My insulin refills have been delayed countless times, not because of medical reasons, but because of what seem to be arbitrary insurance limits and requirements to continuously document my condition, which is permanent. Once, my insulin refill was delayed so long that I ran out, just when the insurance office closed for a three-day weekend. I was a student, away from home, with no other way to pay for my prescription. Terrified, I rushed to the pharmacy in tears. The pharmacist took pity on me and slipped me a vial of insulin without charge, saving my life.\n\nThe worst part about my story is that it isn\u2019t unique, at least not in this country. Young adults with Type 1 diabetes suffer life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis \u2014 a complication caused by insufficient insulin \u2014 at much higher rates in the United States than in Canada. Canada\u2019s single-payer system provides seamless, lifelong coverage. But in the United States, diabetics must wage war with insurance companies to get the care we need, if we have insurance at all.\n\nI\u2019m glad that politicians are finally talking about health care reform. But those who only want to \u201cprotect\u201d the Affordable Care Act or add a public option to our already byzantine mix of private and public plans are missing the point. Americans don\u2019t \u201clove\u201d their private insurance, as many of them claim. They\u2019re grateful for any coverage at all. Americans love their doctors, nurses and pharmacists, because those are the people who save our lives.", "description": "I am alive today not because of insurance companies but despite them.", "authors": ["Rachel Madley"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/17/opinion/17Madley/17Madley-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
