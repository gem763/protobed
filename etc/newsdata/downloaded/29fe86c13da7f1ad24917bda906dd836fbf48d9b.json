Photo: Luke Sharrett\n\nI don\u2019t know what the president expected Jay Powell to do.\n\nThe Fed chairman\u2019s remarks at the Jackson Hole Federal Reserve conference on Friday were in line with his comments after July\u2019s Fed meeting, and with the minutes from that meeting. There are increasingly worrying signs in the global economy, he said. Global trade tensions are one factor worsening the outlook. And the Fed stands ready to pursue appropriate policy adjustments to support the economy as needed.\n\nThe financial markets took Powell\u2019s statement as mildly dovish. Bond yields fell a little, stocks rose a little, the dollar fell a little \u2014 all signs the speech gave market participants a little more confidence the Fed would pursue at least a couple more interest rate cuts. But mostly, the speech seemed to contain what people expected it to contain.\n\nIn response, the president attacked Powell on Twitter, asking who\u2019s the bigger enemy: him, or Chinese president Xi Jinping.\n\nThat tweet didn\u2019t move financial markets. But the next few tweets did. The president declared he\u2019d be announcing a response to China\u2019s most recent tariff escalation this afternoon, and that he \u201chereby\u201d instructs U.S. companies to find somewhere other than China to do business. Stocks promptly fell by 500 points.\n\nObviously, there has often been market turmoil related to the president\u2019s trade policies. But today feels different. For the last couple of years, there had been a pattern: The president escalates, the markets hate it, then the president finds a way to back off, and stocks go back up. For a long time it looked like the president\u2019s China policy was a negative factor for economy, but its effects were manageable, in significant part because Trump faced political incentives to limit the damage.\n\nNow, as the economy shows signs of weakening (in part for reasons unrelated to the president\u2019s actions) he seems panicked. He wants the Fed to clean up his mess but \u2014 despite public perception \u2014 his public jawboning of the Fed appears to be having little effect on monetary policy. The main way the president has been affecting monetary policy has been by taking concrete policy actions that hurt the economic outlook, which changes the parameters the Fed considers as it decides how to set interest rates. The bigger a mess Trump makes, the more rate cuts he can get, but not enough rate cuts to actually offset the mess. And this is making him angry.\n\nThe main lever he has left is his trade policy itself. If he wanted less China-related economic drag, he could back off the tariff threats. And indeed, he did a little of that a couple of weeks ago, delaying some of the new tariffs he announced for September 1 so they won\u2019t take effect until December 15. His administration said this delay was for national security reasons, though he said himself it was because he didn\u2019t want to interfere with the Christmas shopping season.\n\nBut the Chinese appear to have read the delay as a sign of weakness. This week they announced more tariffs, infuriating the president. Since backing off didn\u2019t work, he decided to escalate today. And that\u2019s what\u2019s so nerve-racking for the markets: His trade policy no longer appears to be self-limiting. In fact, it could be self-reinforcing, where tariffs cause damage and the president tries to \u201cfix\u201d the damage with more tariffs.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth considering the possibility that we have gotten too far down the trade-war road for the president to unwind the problems he\u2019s caused. To the extent there are signs of weakness in the domestic economy, they are largely on the producer side. The consumer sector still looks decent. But tariffs and uncertainty over future tariffs have already discouraged businesses from producing and investing. And China has less reason to participate in a de-escalation than they did a year ago, since they can just ride out the next year and hope to be facing a new, less-hostile president. As Jonathan Chait notes, Xi Jinping doesn\u2019t have to worry about reelection like Trump does.\n\nWith a China less willing to back down and a trade war maybe too far along to stop, the president is backed into a corner. He may feel he can\u2019t save the economy by folding. And so he may follow his instinct \u2014 one of the few consistent policy views he has expressed for decades \u2014 that protectionism is good for the economy, and that despite what the markets and his advisers are telling him, trade wars are good and easy to win and more tariffs and more disruption will only mean more winning for the U.S.\n\nWhat the president showed us today is he\u2019s prepared to hit the gas as he approaches the cliff. That should make us all worried about the economic outlook \u2014 and it should make Republicans very worried about the political outlook.", "description": "In the past, Trump\u2019s trade war and his tweets have had negative but negative effects.
