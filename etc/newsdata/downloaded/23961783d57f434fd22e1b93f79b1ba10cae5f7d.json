Why didn\u2019t you think I could do it on my own?\u2019 I had no adequate answer for her then. I have no adequate answer for her now. I can only say, I am so sorry, Sophia. I was frightened, I was stupid, and I was so wrong.\u201d\n\nHuffman recalled the 20-minute drive to the testing center with Sophia sitting next to her. The girl was unaware that Huffman had arranged a $15,000 payment to an admissions consultant to correct and improve her daughter\u2019s SAT test scores after the fact.\n\nOn the way Sophia asked if, after taking the test, the two of them could go for ice cream, Huffman told the judge. \u201cAs we made plans, I kept saying to myself \u2018turn around, turn around, turn around.\u2019 To my eternal shame, I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am profoundly ashamed of what I have done,\u201d Huffman told Judge Indira Talwani in a federal courtroom in Boston. \u201d In trying to help my daughter, I have inflicted more damage than I could ever imagine. I now see all the things that led me down this path, but ultimately none of the reasons matter. Because at the end of the day, I had a choice. I could have said no.\u201d\n\n\u201cI now realize with my mothering, love and truth must go hand in hand. I see that my love coming at the expense of truth is not real love.\u201d\n\n\u201cI take full responsibility for my actions, as a first step in making amends for my crime,\u201d she said.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Felicity Huffman Sentenced to 14 Days Behind Bars in College Admissions Scandal\n\nFelicity Huffman | Charles Krupa/AP/Shutterstock More\n\n\u2022 For more on Felicity Huffman and the college admissions scandal, subscribe now to PEOPLE or pick up this week\u2019s issue, on newsstands Friday.\n\nIn addition to the 14 days incarceration, the judge fined the 56-year-old Huffman $30,000 and placed her on supervised release for one year. She also will have to do 250 hours of community service.\n\nIn a written statement prepared for the judge, Huffman said:\n\n\u201cI accept the court\u2019s decision today without reservation. I have always been prepared to accept whatever punishment Judge Talwani imposed. I broke the law. I have admitted that and I pleaded guilty to this crime. There are no excuses or justifications for my actions. Period.\u201d\n\nRELATED: William H.
