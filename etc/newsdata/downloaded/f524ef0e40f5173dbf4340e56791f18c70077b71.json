We haven't said anything about ether\u2014until now. It is my view as chairman of the CFTC that ether is a commodity,\u201d Tarbert said on stage at Yahoo Finance\u2019s All Markets Summit in New York City on Thursday. Moreover, he also anticipates the CFTC allowing ether futures trading on U.S. markets in the near future, according to the report by Yahoo Finance.\n\nAlso, Tarbert acknowledges \u201cambiguity in the market\u201d on the status of many coins, but says that ultimately \u201csimilar digital assets should be treated similarly,\u201d the report added.\n\n\u201cIt is entirely possible to see Ethereum derivatives this year.\u201d \u2014 Kevin Sekniqi (@kevinsekniqi) October 10, 2019\n\nThe Chairman also said that \u201cforked\u201d coins should be treated by regulators the same as the original asset.\n\n\u201cUnless the fork itself raises some securities law issues under that classic Howey Test [a test created for determining whether certain transactions qualify as investment contracts],\u201d Tarbert was quoted as saying.\n\nMeanwhile, as reported, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), America\u2019s top tax authority, in its new set of guidelines on cryptocurrency taxation said that hard forks will all be taxable.\n\nAt pixel time (14:02 UTC), ether trades at c.
