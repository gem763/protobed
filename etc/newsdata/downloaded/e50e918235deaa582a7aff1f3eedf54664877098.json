Rex Tillerson US Secretary of State\n\nThe agreement, which was branded by Donald Trump as the \u201cworst\u201d ever negotiated, saw Tehran curtail its nuclear program, in exchange for sanctions relief.\n\nHowever, Tillerson branded the deal a failure, as Trump ordered a review of how the US is countering the threat from Iran.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe evidence is clear: Iran\u2019s provocative actions threaten the United States, the region, and the world. As I indicated at the beginning, the Trump administration is currently conducting a comprehensive review of our Iran policy. Once we have finalized our conclusions we will meet the challenges Iran poses with clarity and conviction.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that, without intervention, \u201cIran has the potential to follow the same path as North Korea and take the world along with it\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe United States is keen to avoid a second piece of evidence that strategic patience is a failed approach,\u201d he continued.\n\nHis strong criticism of the country came the day after the State Department officially notified Congress that Iran had met all its commitments under the agreement, something which must be confirmed every 90 days.\n\nTillerson lashed out at the Obama administration, which negotiated the deal alongside other nations, saying that the Trump administration \u201chas no intention of passing the buck to a future administration on Iran\u201d.\n\nThe historic deal was struck between Iran and six other world powers \u2013 the United States, Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany, with help from the European Union \u2013 during the Obama administration, however, it did not address Iran\u2019s support of terrorist organisations or its dismal human rights record.\n\nInstead, it focused on the country\u2019s commitment not to build a nuclear weapon for at least a decade, and to open its military facilities to UN inspections.\n\nThe historic agreement was negotiated with Iran by the United States, Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany, with help from the European Union", "description": "As President Donald Trump orders a review of US policy regarding Iran, Tillerson compares Iran to North Korea", "authors": ["Luke Barber", "Rex Tillerson"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/363644/1000x563_363644.jpg", "published_at": "2017-04-20"}
