It will become law once it is approved Wednesday by the unelected House of Lords, which does not have the power to overrule the elected Commons.\n\nJohnson is pushing for an election in hopes of breaking the parliamentary stalemate that blocked his plan to take Britain out of the European Union this month. This week the EU granted Britain a three-month Brexit extension until Jan. 31.\n\nJohnson is gambling that an election will give his Conservative Party a majority. But after three years of inconclusive political wrangling over Brexit, British voters are weary and the results of an election are hard to predict.\n\nJohnson \u2014 who has had to abandon his vow to lead Britain out of the EU on Oct. 31 \u201cdo or die\u201d \u2014 accused his opponents of wanting to prolong the Brexit process \u201cuntil the 12th of never.\u201d\n\nHe told lawmakers in Parliament on Tuesday there was no choice but \u201cto go to the country to break free from this impasse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is only one way to get Brexit done in the face of this unrelenting parliamentary obstructionism, this endless, willful, fingers crossed, \u2018not me guv\u2019 refusal to deliver on the mandate of the people \u2014 and that is to refresh this Parliament and give the people a choice,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe road to polling day opened up when the main opposition Labour Party, which had opposed three previous attempts by Johnson to trigger an election, changed its position.\n\nNow that Brexit has been delayed, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his opposition party would vote in favor of an early election because the prospect that Britain could crash out of the EU without a divorce deal had been taken off the table.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said consistently, when no-deal is off the table we will back an election,\u201d Corbyn said. \u201cToday, after much denial and much bluster by the prime minister that deal is officially off the table, so this country can vote for the government that it deserves.\u201d\n\nThe looming vote comes two and a half years before the next scheduled election, due in 2022, and will be the country\u2019s first December election since 1923.\n\nLawmakers rejected an attempt by the Labour Party to hold the election on Dec. 9. The party argued the earlier date would mean more students could vote because universities would not have begun their Christmas holidays.\n\nCabinet Office Minister Oliver Dowden said the 12th was preferable because it gave lawmakers a few more days to finish up parliamentary business, and retained Britain\u2019s tradition of holding elections on Thursdays.\n\nEarlier, a last-minute hitch to the government\u2019s plans emerged when opposition parties announced plans to try to amend the terms of an early election to lower the voting age from 18 to 16 and expand the voting base to include citizens of the 27 other EU nations who are living in Britain.\n\nThe government said it would abandon the bill if that plan succeeded. The amendments were not chosen for a vote by parliamentary authorities, who judged that they would have fundamentally altered the legislation.\n\nJohnson took office in July vowing to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d after his predecessor, Theresa May, resigned in defeat. But the Conservative leader, who said just weeks ago that he would \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than postpone the Oct. 31 Brexit date, was forced by Parliament to seek the extension in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit, which would damage the economies of both Britain and the EU.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk tweeted Tuesday that the EU had formally approved the extension, and added, pointedly \u2014 \u201cIt may be the last one. Please make the best use of this time.\u201d\n\nJohnson plans to campaign as a leader who has a viable, strong Brexit plan for the country but who has been stymied by an anti-democratic opposition and a bureaucratic EU.\n\nHe has argued that without an early election, the British government would be like the cartoon character Charlie Brown, \u201cendlessly running up to kick the ball only to have Parliament whisk it away.\u201d\n\nAn election is a risk, though, not only for Johnson\u2019s Conservatives but also for Labour. Opinion polls currently give Johnson\u2019s Conservatives a lead over Labour, but there\u2019s a strong chance that an election could produce a Parliament as divided over Brexit as the current one.\n\nJohnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May called an early election in 2017 with the aim of boosting the Conservatives\u2019 majority and strengthening her hand in negotiations with the EU. The party ended up losing its majority in Parliament, and May failed to pass her key Brexit measures.\n\nMany voters are fed up with politicians from all sides after more than three years of Brexit drama, and all the parties are worried about a backlash from grumpy voters asked to go to the polls at the darkest, coldest time of the year.\n\n\u201cWe all know that a poll in December is less than ideal,\u201d said Pete Wishart, a lawmaker with the opposition Scottish National Party. \u201cBut it is worth that risk in order that we remove this prime minister.\u201d", "description": "Britons will be heading out to vote in the dark days of December after the House of Commons on Tuesday backed an early national vote that could break the...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP830_boris__ZG_20190821054807.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
