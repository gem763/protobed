What do you wish you had done differently in that moment?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I wrote a whole book about it because it was devastating,\u201d Mrs. Clinton responded. \u201cIt was devastating as it was, I know, for the McCain family and your family [with Jon Huntsman in 2012]. \u2026 I\u2019m a serious person but I\u2019m also a fun person, but I think I probably came across as too serious,\u201d she replied. \u201cI really believed that my job, especially as a woman and the first woman to go as far as I did, that I had to help people feel good about a woman in the Oval Office, a woman commander-in-chief, and so I may have over-corrected a little bit because sometimes people say, well why can\u2019t you be like that or why weren\u2019t you like that.\u201d\n\nThe Democrat added that caveat that circumstances beyond her control \u2014 statistical outliers \u2014 also contributed to her loss.\n\n\u201cI really believe that there were unprecedented events in this election, the last election I mean, that were beyond my understanding and nearly anybody else\u2019s. When we started talking in the summer of 2016 about the Russians, you know I think most of the press and the public goes \u2018what is she talking about?\u2019 You know?\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
