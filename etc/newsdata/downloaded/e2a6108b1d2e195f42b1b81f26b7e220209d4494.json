Doha denies the allegations.\n\nLENGTHY DIVERSIONS\n\nThe spat between Qatar and the four Arab countries has cut the number of direct flights to Doha and those operated by state airline Qatar Airways have to make lengthy diversions.\n\nDubai in the UAE could offer a potential reprieve for 2022 World Cup fans seeking entertainment. However, those travelling between Doha and the UAE have to fly through a third country because of the boycott, compared to what was once a roughly a one-hour direct flight.\n\nNasser al-Khater, chief executive of the 2022 World Cup, promised in a recent interview with a group of reporters, that Qatar expected one million fans and there would be plenty to keep them occupied on non-match days.\n\n\u201cWhen their teams are not playing, there is a lot of things they can do,\u201d he said, adding they could go to other matches thanks to the proximity of the eight hosting stadiums.\n\nKhater said that alcohol would be more easily accessible and affordable while the organising committee recently published a list of \u201c10 things to do in Qatar besides football\u201d.\n\nThese included a stroll on the seven-kilometre waterfront promenade, bartering at the Waqif souq, visiting museums and \u201cshop until you drop\u201d.\n\nThe country has tried to make itself more attractive to tourists and launched a \u201cSummer in Qatar\u201d initiative this year to try to attract visitors during the brutally hot months of June, July and August.\n\nA sleek new metro opened this year and is expanding and, although stations appear isolated, they are served by feeder buses and a discounted taxi service.\n\nThe World Cup organisers have not yet announced their visa policy for 2022 and whether fans will be allowed in without tickets or accommodation.\n\nHowever, the country relaxed its visa requirements two years ago. Citizens of more than 80 countries, including all in South America and Europe, have been granted visa-free travel while e-visas for the remainder are generally issued in four days.\n\n\u201cEighty-five nations can come and visit Qatar without a visa making it certainly easier to visit than any World Cup in Europe or the United States,\u201d said Andreas Krieg, assistant professor at King\u2019s College London who has previously worked as a consultant in a Qatari military academy.\n\n\u201cConsidering that it will be between 20\u201325 degrees Celsius, I would think that this makes actually for a great backdrop for fan zones, public viewings etc.\u201d\n\nHowever, others have their doubts, suggesting that organisers of the athletics championships failed to understand that it takes more than a shiny, air-conditioned stadium to make a success out of an event.\n\n\u201cI am not sure that Qatar understands visitors and their needs sufficiently well nor do I think visitors to Qatar are as open-minded and understanding as they could be,\u201d said Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at Britain\u2019s Salford Business School.\n\nChadwick feared that fans from outside the Middle East could indeed be put off by \u201cprevailing perceptions of the region across the world, the likely costs of being there and a possible feeling that low attendances might undermine the event experience\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt seems to me that Qatar needs a holistic strategy for fan engagement, otherwise it could be exposed again to the criticisms it has just faced with the IAAF World Championships.\u201d", "description": "Qatar's hosting of the world athletics championships brought criticism for poor attendances and hot conditions for road events but there was something else which struck many visitors about 2022 World Cup host nation - a lack of things to do.", "authors": ["Brian Homewood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439515458&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A05J", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
