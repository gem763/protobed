Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nSomeone ingenious has finally combined Singapore millennials\u2019 two favourite things: Instagram and bubble tea.\n\nA photogenic pop-up exhibit celebrating the sweet drink, created by local startup El Masno, is launching here on Saturday (Oct 19), with plans to go to other Asian countries afterwards.\n\nBusiness Insider visited the event at a media preview on Tuesday (Oct 15). Here\u2019s what it was like inside:\n\nAttention, boba lovers: Singapore\u2019s first-ever bubble tea-themed exhibition, The Bubble Tea Factory, is opening at *Scape this Saturday (Oct 19).\n\ncaption Entry is free for the first 1,000 in line at 12pm on Oct 19. Expect insane queues. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe exhibition, which runs until Dec 18, costs S$24 for weekday entry and S$28 for weekends and public holidays.\n\ncaption It\u2019s open on weekdays (4pm to 10pm) and weekends (10am to 10pm). source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nTickets are sold at the entrance counter, which was painted a lurid shade of Barbie pink.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nMuch like at a bubble tea stall, people milled around the counter waiting for their ticket number to be called.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nEvery visitor got a pack of eight game cards, which could be exchanged for snacks, a drink, and a mystery gift (only for lucky winners).\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe exhibit\u2019s first room was largely empty, except for a conveyor belt with plastic purple balls going round and round.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nIn line with the factory theme, the setup was meant to look like a taro boba production plant.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nTo get to the next room, I had to walk through a dark corridor with glittering lights that looked a bit like the Matrix.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nIt opened into a room of what I thought were popsicles, but turned out to be upside-down bubble tea cups with neon straws.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nOther corners of the room also featured the upside-down cups.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nA loud fan in each of the cups kept blowing tapioca \u201cpearls\u201d (black plastic balls) inside them up and down.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe next room was toilet-themed, and featured an Instagram must: a neon sign. Paper money was scattered everywhere.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe influencers in our group rushed to the gold bathtub and started staging pictures straight away.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nMeanwhile, I wondered who stuffed money into the toilet bowl.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Inside\n\nI poked around and found a secret room hidden behind a mirror in the fake toilet.\n\nIt was filled with glowing boba balls that changed colour every minute, and reminded me of Japan\u2019s teamLab exhibit.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nI left the money-filled toilet and walked right into another room built for Insta pictures.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThere was a small room for people to recreate the iconic scene from Miley Cyrus\u2019 Wrecking Ball video\u2026\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\n\u2026 and another with a bubble tea IV drip, whose pop culture reference went right over my head.\n\ncaption Grey\u2019s Anatomy?
