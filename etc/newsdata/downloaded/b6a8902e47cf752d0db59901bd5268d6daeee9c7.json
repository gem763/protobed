A rebel alliance of opposition lawmakers and some from his own Conservative Party had forced through a law requiring Johnson to ask the EU to delay Brexit by three months if no deal was agreed by Oct. 19.\n\nAsked how he planned to overcome that obstacle, Johnson ignored the question and repeated his view that an Oct. 31 exit was the legal default.\n\nDemonstrators react on the ruling of the Supreme Court during a protest outside the Supreme Court in London, Britain September 24, 2019. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nThe source in Johnson\u2019s office said the prime minister would return to Britain after giving a speech at the United Nations later in the day.\n\n\u201cThis evening he will be flying back overnight to the UK and there will be a cabinet call today while the PM is in New York,\u201d the source said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the opposition Labour Party declined to comment on whether it would put forward a motion of no confidence to seek to bring down Johnson\u2019s government.\n\nIn financial markets, sterling initially hit a day\u2019s high of $1.2479 after the ruling before falling back to stand at $1.2454 at 1045 GMT, up 0.2% on the day and only slightly stronger than before the court decision.\n\nPEOPLE VS PARLIAMENT?\n\nMore than three years after the United Kingdom voted by 52%-48% in a referendum to leave the European Union, the country remains deeply divided and the Brexit process has become mired in confusion, with options ranging from a turbulent no-deal exit to abandoning the entire endeavor.\n\nIn his comments in New York, Johnson sought to portray the court ruling as the latest attempt by Brexit opponents to thwart the will of the people as expressed in the 2016 referendum.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be in no doubt there are a lot of people who want to frustrate Brexit. There are a lot of people who want to stop this country coming out of the EU,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson\u2019s critics say that such language, pitting parliament and the independent judiciary against the voters, is divisive and dangerous for British democracy.\n\nSlideshow (16 Images)\n\nThe Supreme Court had repeatedly made it clear that it was passing no judgment on the pros and cons of Brexit, but rather was deciding a narrow legal point on whether or not the prime minister\u2019s advice to the queen was unlawful.\n\nFormer Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who had joined anti-Brexit campaigners and opposition lawmakers in the legal challenge against the prorogation, said Johnson should give an \u201cunreserved apology\u201d to parliament.\n\n\u201cNo prime minister must ever treat the monarch or parliament in this way again,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nBuckingham Palace declined to comment.", "description": "The UK Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that Boris Johnson's decision to shut down parliament in the run-up to Brexit was unlawful, but a defiant prime minister said he disagreed and vowed that Britain would leave the EU by Oct. 31, come what may.", "authors": ["Estelle Shirbon", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433288828&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0PC", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
