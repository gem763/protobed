Giuliani in 2017 to discuss \u201cpolitical support and investment\u201d but nothing else. \u201cWe never ever spoke about commercial companies,\u201d Poroshenko said about his conversations with U.S. officials during his time leading Ukraine from 2014 to 2019.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n10:03 a.m. Trump attorney Giuliani elaborates on his late-night text to a reporter announcing plans for a \u201cTrump v The Swamp\u201d lawsuit, which he misspelled as \u201cjaw suit.\u201d Now, he writes on Twitter, \u201cWe are carefully considering our legal options to seek redress against Congress and individual members, for engaging in an organized effort to exceed their limited powers, under the Constitution, and to trample on the constitutional rights of citizens in an illicit plan carried out by illegal means, to remove the President of the U.S., on deliberately falsified charges.\u201d He does not clarify what he means. The Constitution gives the House \u201cthe sole Power of Impeachment\u201d and the Senate \u201cthe sole Power to try all Impeachments.\u201d Courts have interpreted these lines as instructions to stay away. In a ruling of a 1991 case, a court quoted Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 81 explaining that the legislative responsibility for impeachment is an important \u201cconstitutional check\u201d on the judiciary.\n\n10:19 a.m. Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) releases a memo announcing his intention to subpoena on Friday key White House documents as part of the impeachment inquiry. \u201cI do not take this step lightly,\u201d he writes.\n\n10:45 a.m. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) announces that he has signed on to a resolution to censure Intelligence Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.). Last week, Schiff dramatized Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine using made-up words in the voice of a mob boss. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d McCarthy says. The censure motion is unlikely to pass the Democratic-controlled House, if it ever comes to a vote.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n11:07 a.m. The Democratic message of the day is that other work is still getting done. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi comes to a news conference at the Capitol with Schiff. She wants to talk about a bill to lower prescription drug costs. She says the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada is \u201con a path to yes.\u201d She shows her frustration when reporters ask about impeachment. \u201cDoes anybody in this room care about the cost of prescription drugs and what it means to America\u2019s working families?\u201d she says. She eventually allows the questions about impeachment. Schiff calls Trump\u2019s efforts to reveal the whistleblower\u2019s identity \u201can incitement of violence.\u201d\n\n11:19 a.m. Trump tweets that the \u201cimpeachment nonsense\u201d is responsible for a drop in stock markets, which are down roughly 2 percent since the open. This is not the dominant view on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average was effectively unchanged Monday from a week earlier, the day before Democrats announced an impeachment pursuit. But the Institute for Supply Management announced yesterday that its manufacturing index fell to the lowest level since the end of the 2007-2009 recession. \u201cGlobal trade remains the most significant issue,\u201d the report\u2019s author concluded, a reference to U.S.-China tensions. The Atlanta Federal Reserve subsequently l owered its GDP forecasts. On Tuesday, Trump blamed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell for the bad manufacturing numbers.\n\n11:48 a.m. In a tweet, the president calls the impeachment inquiry \u201cBULLSHIT.\u201d He says Democrats should focus instead on \u201cbuilding up our Country.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n12:19 p.m. Trump further responds to Pelosi\u2019s news conference in a whirlwind Oval Office meeting. He disputes Pelosi\u2019s contention that Democrats are focused on topics other than impeachment. He rails against the \u201ccorrupt\u201d media. He says his call with Ukraine\u2019s leader was \u201cperfect\u201d and the Biden family is \u201ccorrupt.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he says, when asked whether the whistleblower should be allowed to remain anonymous, as indicated by law. He says that Schiff should resign from office and be charged with treason, and that the Intelligence Committee chairman is less impressive than Pompeo. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t carry his \u2018blank\u2019 strap,\u201d Trump says, to explain the relative worth of the two men. This is a knock on Schiff\u2019s manliness, derived from the vernacular of locker rooms. \u201c \u2018Blank\u2019 strap\u201d means \u201cjock strap,\u201d but Trump doesn\u2019t want to say the word. The Finnish president, Sauli Niinisto, is sitting next to Trump. A Finnish reporter says Finland is a happy place and asks what the United States can learn from Finland. \u201cWell, have you got rid of Pelosi and you got rid of shifty Schiff?\u201d Trump asks. He is joking.\n\n1:08 p.m. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who has traveled repeatedly to Ukraine on behalf of the Trump Administration, says \u201cwe\u2019re going to work with Congress and answer all their questions,\u201d according to CNN. Democratic House and Senate leaders have requested information about these visits.\n\n1:40 p.m. Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is asked at a Las Vegas event whether he would allow his vice president\u2019s children to serve on a foreign company\u2019s board, as Hunter Biden did during the Obama presidency. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., refuses to answer. \u201cPlaying that game is playing the president\u2019s game,\u201d Buttigieg says. \u201cAnd the moment you\u2019re playing it, even when you\u2019re winning, you\u2019re losing.\u201d Several other Democratic candidates, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Sen. Michael F. Bennet (Colo.) and businessman Andrew Yang, have said they would seek to avoid a repeat of that situation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n1:55 p.m. Pelosi continues to challenge Trump\u2019s messaging dominance. ABC News releases an interview with the speaker in which she talks again about the Democratic focus on lowering prescription drug prices and passing a new North American trade deal. Then she turns to impeachment. \u201cI think the president knows the argument that can be made against him,\u201d she says, \u201cand he\u2019s scared.\u201d\n\n2:12 p.m. The New York Times reports more details on the whistleblower\u2019s efforts to raise his concerns. The whistleblower had a colleague convey a version of his accusations to the top lawyer at the C.I.A. before filing a whistleblower complaint, according to unnamed sources. The whistleblower also approached a House Intelligence Committee aide with some version of his concerns. Committee staff subsequently shared some of what the whistleblower conveyed with Schiff, the article reports. \u201cLike other whistleblowers have done before and since under Republican and Democratic-controlled committees, the whistleblower contacted the committee for guidance on how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of the intelligence community,\u201d a spokesman for the committee explains in the story. \u201cAt no point did the committee review or receive the complaint in advance.\u201d This appears to contradict a previous statement by Schiff. On Sept. 17, he told MSNBC, \u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower.\u201d\n\n2:25 p.m. Trump is back on television for a news conference with Niinisto, who tells Trump in the East Room that he has been visiting museums in Washington. \u201cMr. President, you have here a great democracy,\u201d he says. \u201cKeep it going on.\u201d After an extended discussion about U.S.-Finland policy, Trump gets an impeachment question and launches another monologue on Schiff, the \u201choax\u201d impeachment investigation and his \u201cperfect\u201d phone call with Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n2:48 p.m. Trump cuts off a reporter who has already asked a question but wants to ask another. The reporter, John Roberts of Fox News, says Trump might like his next question. Trump\u2019s interest is piqued. He lets Roberts ask a question about the New York Times scoop that dropped in the last hour. Trump is delighted. \u201cI love that question,\u201d he says. \u201cThank you, John.\u201d Trump says the report shows Schiff is a fraud. In the Oval Office a couple of hours ago, he was merciless in his criticism of the New York Times. Now he is not. \u201cI give a lot of respect for the New York Times putting it out,\u201d he says of the scoop. The president then says, without evidence, that he believes Schiff helped write the whistleblower complaint. \u201cIt\u2019s a scam,\u201d Trump says. \u201cThe whole thing is a scam.\u201d\n\n2:55 p.m. Reuters reporter Jeff Mason asks the central question of the impeachment scandal: \u201cCan you just make clear right here what do you or what did you want President Zelensky to do with regard to Joe and Hunter Biden?\u201d Trump gives an extended answer about his frustration about European financial support for Ukraine and corruption in the country. He says he had frozen financial support for Ukraine because he did not want the United States to be the \u201csucker country.\u201d Democrats have charged that the money was frozen to prod Ukraine to dig up dirt on a political rival. After Trump finishes, another reporter asks him to answer the original question about Biden. \u201cBiden and his son are stone-cold crooked,\u201d Trump says. \u201cAnd you know it.\u201d\n\n3:01 p.m. Mason won\u2019t let it go. \u201cThe question was, sir, what did you want President Zelensky to do about Vice President Biden and his son Hunter?\u201d Trump is unhappy with this follow-up. \u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d he asks. \u201cWe have the president of Finland. Ask him a question.\u201d Mason calmly repeats the question again for Trump about Biden. \u201cDid you hear me. Ask him a question,\u201d Trump says. \u201cDon\u2019t be rude.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n3:02 p.m. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be rude,\u201d Mason continues, calmly. \u201cI just want to give you a chance to answer the question.\u201d Trump will not answer the question. \u201cI\u2019ve answered everything,\u201d Trump says. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole hoax. And you know who is playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country.\u201d He goes on for a bit about the \u201ccorrupt media.\u201d \u201cAsk the president of Finland a question, please,\u201d Trump concludes.\n\n3:03 p.m. Mason does just that, addressing the Finnish leader with a question about the resolution of a trade dispute between the U.S. and Europe. Before Niinisto can answer, Trump interrupts. \u201cThat was a big win for the United States, right?\u201d Trump says. \u201cYou never had wins with other presidents.\u201d Mason points out that the case started long before Trump became president. Trump disagrees.\n\n3:40 p.m. CNN reports it has asked Mark Zaid, an attorney for the whistleblower, whether Schiff or the House Intelligence Committee helped in any way with the whistleblower complaint. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Zaid responds. Republican leaders continue to run with the story. \u201cChairman Adam B. Schiff just got caught orchestrating with the whistleblower before the complaint was ever filed,\u201d McCarthy tweets. \u201cDemocrats have rigged this process from the start.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n4:25 p.m. An \u201curgent\u201d briefing of House leaders by the State Department inspector general concludes with no official readout. Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the Oversight Committee, appears before reporters to announce that the inspector general turned over \u201ca package of propaganda, disinformation and conspiracy theories\u201d attempting to debunk special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s finding that Russia had sought to influence the 2016 election. Raskin says he doesn\u2019t know where the documents originated, but they were addressed to the secretary of state. \u201cThe whole thing looks rather amateurish to me,\u201d Raskin says. \u201cThere is nothing that relates to the president\u2019s impeachable conduct.\u201d\n\n5:09 p.m. The ranking Democrat of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Robert Menendez (N.J.), describes the documents from the inspector general as containing \u201clong-debunked theories and false statements about the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine and one of President Trump\u2019s political opponents.\u201d He says in a statement he wants to know Pompeo\u2019s role in handling the documents. \u201cIt appears that he discussed these documents with at least one of his top aides and that the documents were distributed at the highest levels of the State Department,\u201d Menendez says.\n\n5:51 p.m. The Washington Post reports on Trump\u2019s efforts to involve Vice President Pence in his pressuring of Ukraine. The article says people close to Pence insist he was unaware of Trump\u2019s urging Zelensky to find damaging information about the Bidens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n6:35 p.m. Pelosi\u2019s office releases quotes from a phone call she held with Democratic members earlier today. She calls Attorney General William P. Barr, Pompeo and Giuliani \u201chenchmen.\u201d She also repeats other talking points. \u201cI do think that this is a moment beyond Donald Trump,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s almost not worth it, to do an impeachment, because he is so what he is, but the Constitution is worth it, and our Democracy is worth it, and our \u2018Republic, if we can keep it\u2019 is worth it.\u201d", "description": "A tough question for Trump, Pelosi jockeys for attention, Giuliani threatens a \u201cjaw suit,\u201d and the White House Twitter war turns profane.", "authors": ["Michael Scherer", "National Political Reporter Covering Campaigns", "Congress", "The White House"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/X3hDUh9D0l7tsLumueJ6vBqiclw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H3MXSZHFLQI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
