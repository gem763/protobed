The modern standard of dangerous speech comes from Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969) and holds that speech that directly incites \u201cimminent lawless action\u201d or is likely to do so can be restricted. Domestic terrorists such as Dylann Roof and Omar Mateen and the El Paso shooter were consumers of hate speech. Speech doesn\u2019t pull the trigger, but does anyone seriously doubt that such hateful speech creates a climate where such acts are more likely?\n\nLet the debate begin. Hate speech has a less violent, but nearly as damaging, impact in another way: It diminishes tolerance. It enables discrimination. Isn\u2019t that, by definition, speech that undermines the values that the First Amendment was designed to protect: fairness, due process, equality before the law? Why shouldn\u2019t the states experiment with their own version of hate speech statutes to penalize speech that deliberately insults people based on religion, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation?\n\nAll speech is not equal. And where truth cannot drive out lies, we must add new guardrails. I\u2019m all for protecting \u201cthought that we hate,\u201d but not speech that incites hate. It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.", "description": "", "authors": ["Richard Stengel", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Why-America-Needs-Hate-Speech-Law"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
