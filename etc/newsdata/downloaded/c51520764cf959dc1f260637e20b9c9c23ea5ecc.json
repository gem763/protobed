While they both run in the same circles, they at least managed to escape bumping into each other on the red carpet.\n\nOvie, 28, rocked up to the awards ceremony looking dapper in a navy suit and white shirt, and was spotted taking time to sign autographs for fans. But once inside, he reunited with his best Love Island pal Amber Gill, whom he sat with for the show.\n\nThe besties were back to their usual antics of joking around with each other, and larked around in Amber\u2019s Instagram Stories. Coincidentally, India also spent time with Amber after they presented the young achiever award to Hezron Brown, a reformed gang member.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndia, also 28, looked stunning on the red carpet in a burgundy off-the-shoulder gown and seemed to be in good spirits while posing for photos.\n\nThe lingerie model publicly confirmed the split for the first time while speaking to the Mail Online on the red carpet.\n\n\u2018Obviously it\u2019s difficult, but any break-up is difficult,\u2019 she admitted. \u2018It\u2019s even more difficult when it\u2019s in front of the rest of the world, but I\u2019ll be fine.\u2019\n\nIndia admits break-ups are difficult (Picture: WireImage)\n\n\u2018I\u2019m lucky I\u2019ve got a really close group of girlfriends, they\u2019ve been really looking after me.\u2019\n\nWhen asked if guys had been sliding into her DMs now that she\u2019s single again, India laughed: \u2018Maybe they\u2019ll be a bit more full now!\u2019\n\nAlthough she did admit being single again feels strange, joking: \u2018I feel like I\u2019ve been dropped back in the ocean. We\u2019ll see.\u2019\n\nOvie was in good spirits (Picture: Splash News)\n\nOvie and India struck up a romance this summer after meeting on Love Island and made it to the final, finishing in third place.\n\nHowever, reports that their relationship was on the rocks emerged earlier this month with an insider revealing they were having \u2018crisis talks\u2019. It had been more than a month since they were seen together and sources say they were struggling to spend time together due to their busy work schedules.\n\nIndia hinted that she was receiving negative messages online as she posted on Instagram hours after the split: \u2018It\u2019s free to be kind\u2026 Think before you type\u2026 Thank you x.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOvie seems to be in high spirits as he shared an uplifting message for his fans after hitting the gym on Sunday.\n\n\u2018On this beautiful Sunday you should all remember: \u201cShine bright like a diamond.\u201d Because Rihanna said so,\u2019 he said in the video which he captioned: \u2018Post gym energy.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?\n\nIf you've got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.\n\nMORE: ITV2\u2019s Killer Camp dubbed \u2018murder\u2019 Love Island and we\u2019re already hooked\n\nMORE: Yewande Biala convinced winter Love Island will flop as hype dies down\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\na,abbr,acronym,address,applet,article,aside,audio,b,big,blockquote,body,canvas,caption,center,cite,code,dd,del,details,dfn,div,dl,dt,em,embed,fieldset,figcaption,figure,footer,form,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6,header,html,i,iframe,img,ins,kbd,label,legend,li,mark,menu,nav,object,ol,output,p,pre,q,ruby,s,samp,section,small,span,strike,strong,sub,summary,sup,table,tbody,td,tfoot,th,thead,time,tr,tt,u,ul,var,video{margin:0;padding:0;border:0;font-size:100%;font:inherit;vertical-align:baseline}h1,h2,h3{font-weight:400}article,aside,details,figcaption,figure,footer,header,menu,nav,section{display:block}body{line-height:1}ol,ul{list-style:none}blockquote,q{quotes:none}blockquote:after,blockquote:before,q:after,q:before{content:'';content:none}table{border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0}[data-alt-headline]{visibility:hidden} img{width:100%;height:auto;}", "description": "Love Island stars India Reynolds and Ovie Soko managed to avoid bumping into each other at the Pride of Britain Awards after their split.", "authors": ["Alicia Adejobi"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/love-islands-india-reynolds-and-ovie-soko_1572334004.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
