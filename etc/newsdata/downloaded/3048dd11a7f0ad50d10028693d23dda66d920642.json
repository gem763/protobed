George Walker, Nashville Tennessean\n\nThe Titans released kicker Cairo Santos on Monday, one day after he missed four field goals in a 14-7 loss to the Buffalo Bills at Nissan Stadium.\n\nSantos, who joined the Titans in the preseason after veteran Ryan Succop was placed on injured reserve, missed from 50 and 36 yards in the second quarter and 33 and 53 yards in the fourth.\n\nCody Parkey is the likely replacement for Santos, a person with knowledge of the team's intentions confirmed to The Tennessean after NFL Network first reported the Titans were flying in the former Bears kicker Monday night. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the move was not yet official.\n\nParkey was just 23-for-30 on field-goal attempts for Chicago last season. He also missed three of his 45 extra points tries. He was signed to a four-year, $15 million deal in 2018 before Chicago cut him in February, absorbing a $5.2 million cap hit in the process.\n\nThe Titans also released offensive lineman David Quessenberry, a cancer survivor who caught a touchdown pass earlier this season.\n\nSuccop is expected to miss at least three more games before he's eligible to return after Week 8.\n\nSantos made just four of nine attempts with the Titans this season.\n\n\"It was very painful, a very disappointing day,\" Santos said Sunday. \"I don't feel sorry for myself. I feel sorry for my teammates and coaches that work hard all week. I work hard, too, and it was not the performance I've been putting out there in practice and in games for a long time.\"\n\nSantos said he realized he hit the ball awkwardly on his first attempt and then tried to adjust with no success.\n\n\"Nothing felt right,\" he said. \"After the first one, I saw the ball sort of drawing away; it wasn't how I've been hitting the ball. I tried to make a correction and cut it a little more on the next one and then sliced it.\"\n\nHe has been in the NFL since 2014, playing for the Kansas City Chiefs, Chicago Bears, Los Angeles Rams and Tampa Bay Buccaneers before landing with the Titans.", "description": "The Titans have found their replacement for kicker Cairo Santos after he missed all four of his field goal attempts in a loss to the Bills.", "authors": ["Tommy Deas", "Mike Organ", "Erik Bacharach", "Published P.M.
