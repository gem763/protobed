(AP) - Stepping into the newly completed Mosaic Backyard Universe is more like stepping off a back porch with a direct view of the solar system and the inner workings of a tree all while digging up fossils, and it was designed to feel just that way.\n\nBuilt for \u201cearly learners,\u201d children about 2 to 8 years old, the Mosaic Backyard Universe at the Bishop Museum of Science and Nature aims to provide a safe, fun and familiar learning environment to foster curiosity and exploration in science and nature.\n\n\u201cThe museum has been around for 70 years but it wasn\u2019t built with the early-learning audience in mind. And when Mosaic came to us in 2011 and said they\u2019d like to help us with building a new exhibit for children we knew had an age range that we thought could benefit from a more immersive environment built just for them,\u201d said Brynne Anne Besio, CEO of the Bishop Museum of Science and Nature.\n\nThe long-awaited 3,290-square-foot addition opened to the public on Oct. 1 at the Bishop Museum of Science and Nature, 201 10th St. W. in downtown Bradenton.\n\nWork on the exhibit began in January.\n\nMatt Woodside, chief curator and director of exhibits at the museum, said the Backyard helps introduce basic concepts of natural history and science.\n\nNow, guests can turn their heads in different directions and see scaled-down versions of the planets (Pluto included), a cardboard spaceship, a hand-painted mural, a pond with live turtles, science shed, a dig pit and a treehouse (complete with an Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant elevator).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created what we know is a familiar space to children and to adults and that\u2019s the outside - your backyard or a park. And we are excited to be able to bring this to our region and community as a unique resource for learning,\u201d Besio said.\n\nA replica of a Southern Live Oak tree includes interactive features that show guests what the inside of a tree looks like. The tree, created by NatureMaker Steel Art Trees, is made from steel and clad with an artificial bark. Eventually, model animals will be added to the tree.\n\nBackpacks available inside aim to enhance the Backyard experience and provide tools and activities such as scavenger hunts and matching games centered around paleontology, geology, biology, astronomy and engineering.\n\n\u201cThis is being built as a parent and child engagement space or an adult and child engagement space. So when a parent comes in, they\u2019re the leader, they\u2019re the guide. They\u2019ll be able to check out a backpack on astronomy or biology or paleontology and work with their child to learn about those sciences. This is about them working together to learn,\u201d Besio said.\n\nIn a continued partnership with local schools, the museum will offer more school field trip opportunities. Four new themed field trips for pre-kindergarten through third grade students include life science, earth and space science, physical science and connections of the different sciences. Field trips are scheduled to begin in November.\n\nThe cost of admission to the museum has increased as of Oct. 1. Admission includes the Mosaic Backyard Universe.\n\nAdmission for adults ages 18 to 64 increased to $23.95, seniors 65 and older to $21.95, college students and children ages 12-17 to $17.95, children ages 5-11 to $14.95, children ages 2-4 to $8.95 and children under 2 are free with a paying adult.\n\nThe Mosaic Backyard Universe is part of an expansion to the museum that includes the North Education Center, which is set to open alongside the Mosaic Backyard Universe.\n\nMosaic and the Mosaic Company Foundation provided the museum with a $1.3 million grant for the expansion.\n\nFor the general expansion and other capital projects, the museum has raised nearly $15 million. The Backyard cost $9 million to construct.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Science and Nature changed its name and re-branded in April to bring the what was once South Florida Museum and Bishop Planetarium under one umbrella and name the entire space for the Bishop family.\n\nThe local family was instrumental in getting the museum off the ground and has continued to support it.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Bradenton (Fla.)
