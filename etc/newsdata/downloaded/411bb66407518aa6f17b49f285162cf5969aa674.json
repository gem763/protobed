Retailers will have two weeks to remove merchandise from store shelves.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, had proposed the emergency ban Sunday , citing surging use among young people.\n\nAccording to data from the state health department, nearly 40% of high school seniors and 27% of high school students overall in the state use e-cigarettes. Use among high-school students went from 10.5% in 2014 to 27.4% in 2018.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

He said smokers looking to quit will have fewer options under the ban. As for the breathing illnesses, Kruger said he believes they are the result of people buying black market vape liquid, not the items he sells.\n\n\u201cWe are bypassing the legislative process,\u201d he said of the ban. Kruger added that many adults seek out the flavored versions. He himself prefers blue raspberry. \u201cVaping has been around for 12 years. And now this.\u201d\n\nThe exemption for menthol was criticized by some health groups, who worried young people would switch to that variety. It includes all types of flavored vaping products, including disposable and refillable devices.\n\nJuul Labs, Inc., the company with the biggest footprint in the industry, has said it agrees with the need for action in the flavored e-cigarette sector and will comply with any final state and federal regulations.\n\nNationwide, health officials are investigating hundreds of cases of serious breathing illnesses in people who use e-cigarettes and other vaping devices. They have identified 380 confirmed and probable cases in 36 states and one territory, including six deaths. President Donald Trump has proposed a federal ban on flavored e-cigarettes and vaping products.\n\nNew York becomes the first state to enact the ban. Michigan approved a ban that includes menthol, but not tobacco flavor, but rules for enactment have not yet been put into place. Other states are also considering bans.\n\nThe statewide smoking age is going up to 21, after Cuomo signed legislation earlier this year. He also recently signed a mandate that requires state anti-tobacco campaigns to also include vaping.\n\nThe FDA has been able to ban vaping flavors since 2016 but has yet to take the step.\n\nThe global market is estimated to have a value of as much as $11 billion.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Retailers will have two weeks to remove merchandise from store shelves", "authors": ["Deepti Hajela"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/ap19259837096579.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
