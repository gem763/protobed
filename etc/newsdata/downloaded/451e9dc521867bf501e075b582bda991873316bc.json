Elizabeth Warren \u2014 is unconstitutional. It could hand down its ruling just weeks before Democrats' 2020 convention.\n\nThe big picture: The CFPB has a single director whom the president cannot fire at will. Critics say that's a violation of the president's constitutional powers. The court will have three options: uphold the CFPB's structure, rule that the director must be fireable (as Justice Brett Kavanaugh ruled previously), or throw out the CFPB altogether.", "description": "Brett Kavanaugh has previously said that it is.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/vObewEOO5-0e1FzmUBgRcOvyz2U=/0x0:5568x3132/1920x1080/2019/10/18/1571426316657.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
