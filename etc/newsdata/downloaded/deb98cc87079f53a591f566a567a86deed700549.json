At the heart of the anger over \u201ccancel culture\u201d is the fear that you might get canceled yourself \u2014 combined with the indignation that someone might ask you to change. But to make their griping seem noble \u2014 instead of just lazy \u2014 these anti-canceling crusaders declare that in fact it\u2019s the culture that\u2019s attacking them. Virtues like \u201caccountability\u201d and \u201ccourtesy\u201d are recast as \u201cauthoritarianism\u201d and \u201cgiving in to the mob.\u201d\n\nNot every \u201ccancellation\u201d is justified. We live in an unprecedented post-Internet moment: Most of us weren\u2019t expecting our past statements to be readily searchable at all times and might have been more thoughtful if we had. And I\u2019m not defending that woker-than-thou minority that really does exist, one which gangs up on others to highlight their own perfection. What used to be private reprimands now often take place in the public domain, and public dressing-downs rarely work as well as we would hope.\n\nBut social mores change, and so does humor.", "description": "", "authors": ["Christine Emba", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Virtues-Our-Cancel-Culture"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
