But it didn't work.\n\nTwohey and Kantor's reporting, along with stories by Ronan Farrow of The New Yorker, eventually led to more than 80 women in the film industry coming forward with allegations of assault and harassment against Weinstein, and helped kick off the global #MeToo movement, calling for powerful men to be held to account for sexual assault and misconduct.\n\nCourt officials say the disgraced movie mogul is due in court the same day an appeals court is expected to rule on his lawyers' motion to move his trial out of New York City. (Mark Lennihan/The Associated Press)\n\n\"This story went far beyond Harvey Weinstein,\" Twohey told The Current's interim host Laura Lynch. \"This ultimately was an X-ray into abuse of power, and the machinery that was in place to silence women.\"\n\nTwohey and Kantor detail many of those abuses of power, and their efforts to uncover them, in their new book She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement.\n\nThe two cross-referenced their interviews with victims (including a number of famous actresses like Gwyneth Paltrow and Ashley Judd) by speaking to many other parties in the industry and uncovering extensive documentation. That helped them to unveil the web of power that, they found, kept even huge celebrities from speaking out.\n\nActor Gwyneth Paltrow was one of the actresses who spoke to Kantor and Twohey about how Weinstein allegedly harassed her. (Thibault Camus/Canadian Press/Associated Press)\n\n\"This investigation had a lot of potential to help bring the broader issue of sexual harassment, and the use of work to manipulate and terrorize, to light,\" said Twohey.\n\nWeinstein pleaded not guilty in August to a new indictment that includes revised charges of predatory sexual assault, a development that caused the judge to delay the start of his trial until Jan. 6.\n\nHe previously pleaded not guilty to charges accusing him of raping a woman in 2013 and performing a forcible sex act on a different woman in 2006.\n\nSilencing accusers with non-disclosure pacts\n\nOne of the moments when the two reporters knew they were \"getting to bedrock\" in their investigation, Kantor said, was when Twohey uncovered a December 2016 memo to Weinstein from a famed feminist lawyer named Lisa Bloom, who had decided to \"cross over\" and work for him.\n\nIn the memo, Bloom detailed a six-point plan to discredit and manipulate actress Rose McGowan, who had tweeted that she had been raped by a prominent producer, who many in the film world believed to be Weinstein.\n\nThe plan included a \"counter ops online campaign\" to suggest McGowan was a pathological liar, working to make sure a Google search for her would show an article about the actress \"becoming increasingly unglued,\" and coming out publicly in a pre-emptive interview where Weinstein would talk about his evolving support for women's issues following the death of his mother.\n\nLisa Bloom, who became famous as a feminist lawyer representing women in lawsuits against Bill Cosby, Bill O'Reilly and Jeffrey Epstein, penned a memo to Weinstein with a plan for how to discredit his accuser. New York Times reporter Meghan Twohey uncovered the memo.

An ongoing case at the University of Windsor has ignited a conversation around these gag orders in Canada as well.\n\n\"I think that there is now a broader conversation happening about whether or not these secret settlements have helped conceal public dangers,\" said Twohey.\n\nEx-Mossad agents hired to intimidate reporters\n\nThe two reporters don't just expose how Weinstein tried to silence his victims. In their book, they document how he tried to silence their reporting as well.\n\nWeinstein reportedly hired the secretive Israeli private investigation firm Black Cube , staffed by ex-Mossad agents, to try to manipulate their reporting. The firm was offered $300,000 US if they successfully stopped the Times' investigation.\n\nKantor said that during their investigation a woman posing as a woman's rights advocate and actress approached her about a story. The woman was actually a Black Cube agent.\n\n\"She was trying to dupe and manipulate me \u2014 and not just me, but other reporters and and most significantly some of our sources,\" she said.\n\nKantor also described a scene in which Weinstein and his lawyers barged into the New York Times office, days before they published their first story, and tried \"to smear [his accusers] in the eleventh hour to stop our investigation,\" she said.\n\n\"It was the final hour when Weinstein realized that he was basically cornered and that we were in fact going to publish.\"\n\nMegan Twohey, left, and Jodi Kantor address colleagues in the newsroom in New York after the team they led won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 2018.

(Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times via The Associated Press)\n\nKantor said that, given that Weinstein wasn't very famous outside the film world, they were \"completely staggered\" that their story helped spur the worldwide #MeToo movement.\n\n\"We've believed for a long time that facts can drive social change,\" she said. \"But we had never seen a reaction like this in our lives.\"\n\nWritten by Allie Jaynes.
