In the last year, Twitter has deleted tens of thousands of accounts posting violent content, Facebook has created an oversight board for moderation and Youtube has purged millions of channels that broke their guidelines.\n\nLawmakers have discussed moderation at length, with some calling for amending, or even gutting, a law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\n\nThat law gives websites broad legal immunity for what their users write on their platforms, while also shielding them from liability for taking efforts to moderate their sites as they see fit.\n\nWednesday's poll suggests some public support for removing Section 230.\n\nTwenty-one percent of respondents said social media companies are always legally responsible for offensive content shared on their platforms, while 39 percent said they are sometimes legally responsible. Just 9 percent of respondents said companies are never legally responsible for the content.\n\nMorning Consult surveyed 2,072 self-identified social media users between Aug. 21-24. The margin of error for the sample is 2 points.", "description": "The majority of American social media users want the government to intervene in moderating content, according to a new\u00a0poll", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/tampingdown_socialmedia_082418istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
