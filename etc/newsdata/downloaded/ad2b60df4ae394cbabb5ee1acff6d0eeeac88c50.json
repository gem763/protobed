The bill now goes to the House of Lords.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to unite the country and get Brexit done,\u201d Johnson said after meeting Conservative Party lawmakers who cheered him.\n\nBefore the vote, Johnson had said parliament was obstructing Brexit and thus damaging the economy by preventing investment decisions, and corroding faith in democracy.\n\nThe first Christmas election in Britain since 1923 would be highly unpredictable: Brexit has variously fatigued and enraged swathes of voters while eroding traditional loyalties to the two major parties, Conservative and Labour.\n\nSome politicians feel an election so close to Christmas could irritate voters, while campaigning and getting voters out could be hampered by cold winter weather and darkness setting in by mid-afternoon.\n\nUltimately, the electorate will have a choice between an emboldened Johnson pushing for his Brexit deal or a socialist government under Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn renegotiating the deal before another referendum.\n\nThe election result will be announced in the early hours of Friday the 13th. If no party wins conclusively, the Brexit deadlock would continue.\n\nCHRISTMAS ELECTION\n\nAfter four years of arguing over Brexit, almost all British politicians now agree an election is needed to break the cycle of inaction that has shocked allies of a country once considered a bastion of stable Western capitalism and democracy.\n\nAn election, though, could decide the fate of Brexit as well as the main players - Johnson, 55, and his rival Corbyn, 70.\n\nWhen Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May, bet on an early election in 2017, she lost her slender majority - a failure that ultimately prevented her from ratifying her Brexit deal in parliament and sank her political career.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seen on Downing Street in London, Britain October 29, 2019. REUTERS/Yara Nardi\n\nJohnson\u2019s Conservatives are ahead of Labour by an average of about 10 percentage points in polls this month, though pollsters underestimated the support for Brexit in 2016 and admit that the models they use are wilting beside the Brexit furnace.\n\nBoth major parties will have to fight on at least three fronts: against each other while the hardline Brexit Party led by Nigel Farage seeks to poach Brexit voters and the Liberal Democrats seeks to win over opponents of Brexit.\n\n\u201cThis will probably be the most unpredictable election I have ever known,\u201d Anand Menon, director of The UK in a Changing Europe, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cIs it Brexit or is it not? We don\u2019t know. Second, the election is as volatile as ever and, thirdly, the potential for tactical voting - and tactical voting to go wrong - is very high given the Leave-Remain split,\u201d he said.\n\nBREXIT UP IN THE AIR\n\nLabour swung behind an election earlier on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready for it,\u201d Corbyn told parliament. He frames Labour as a socialist alternative to the inequality and close relations with U.S. President Donald Trump that he says characterise Johnson\u2019s premiership. \u201cChange is coming.\u201d\n\nAs Johnson moved closer to an election than he has ever been in his tumultuous three-month premiership, the EU granted a Brexit delay to Jan. 31 but warned it might be the last.\n\nSlideshow (16 Images)\n\n\u201cThe EU27 has formally adopted the extension. It may be the last one. Please make the best use of this time,\u201d outgoing European Union Chairman Donald Tusk said on Twitter.\n\nAmong voters, there was some relief that the Brexit debate might be ending soon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to bring this to some sort of resolution,\u201d commuter Matt Finch, 36, said outside London\u2019s Charing Cross rail station on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve had many votes in the last 12 months in parliament and I think a general election might be a way to sort it all out.\u201d", "description": "Britain will hold its first December election in almost a century after Prime Minister Boris Johnson won approval from parliament on Tuesday for an early ballot aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock.", "authors": ["Guy Faulconbridge", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446307480&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S1US", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
