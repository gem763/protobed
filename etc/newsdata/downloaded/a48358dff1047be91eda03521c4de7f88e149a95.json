It provides me with an opportunity to share my voice and bring attention to issues I believe are important, to meet inspirational people and to enjoy unforgettable experiences around the world, and I enjoy it almost every day. Yet even in progressive Iceland, and certainly abroad, there are lingering and dated assumptions about what I should be doing and how I should be acting that are at best disconcerting and at worst, downright abhorrent to my feminist nature.\n\nIn short, being a first lady, even in 2019, remains very, very peculiar.\n\nOn the one hand, to serve my adopted country in this way is a privilege and an honor for which I am very grateful. Moreover, it is an opportunity: Day to day, when choosing those activities in which I wish to take part, I am guided by preconceptions of my role as spouse and how I wish to modernize them. I delivered a keynote address at this year\u2019s StartUp Iceland conference, for instance \u2014 but declined to be involved in the process of redecorating the presidential residence\u2019s main reception area.\n\nOn state visits, which are scheduled to the minute around the dictums of protocol and bilateral priorities, for example, one of my aims is to confound the often gendered expectations of what \u201cthe wife\u201d should do: During what is usually called the \u201cspouse program,\u201d I deliver speeches that I write myself, or I participate in panels about issues in which Iceland can showcase its strengths \u2014 sustainable tourism, entrepreneurship and innovation, and yes, gender equality.\n\nYet I still resent the occasions when my presence is assumed rather than requested. I am not my husband\u2019s handbag, to be snatched as he runs out the door and displayed silently by his side during public appearances. (Of course, he doesn\u2019t even have a handbag; he has proper pockets in his clothes that discreetly store everything he will need. But that\u2019s another discussion.)\n\nAnd it\u2019s uncomfortable to have strangers tell me I now look much nicer with my hair longer, that I should more often wear blazers that flatter my figure or that I should not wear green again because it\u2019s not my color. On virtually every solo trip I make as first lady, I am asked who is looking after our four young children, as if their devoted father has no parental obligations. If I am ever asked about my professional background, it is always in the past tense, although I still continue much of my paid work. (Why should I get a new job because my husband was elected to one?)", "description": "The perils of navigating this unofficial, undefined role in 2019.", "authors": ["Eliza Reid"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/01/opinion/01Reid1/01Reid1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
