One version of the video has been viewed more than 123,000 times since February.\n\nSuda and her two children have been living with relatives in El Paso, Texas, for the past 1 \u00bd months while her husband \u2014 a Customs and Border Protection employee himself \u2014 is seeking a job transfer to join them. \u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d Suda said. \u201cOur lives are not the same, it\u2019s not the same anymore. These guys destroyed everything we have.\u201d\n\nHernandez has been living in Great Falls but still commutes to her job in Havre, said their attorney, Alex Rate of the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The agent, Paul O\u2019Neill, entered the store, overheard them and kept them in the parking lot for approximately 40 minutes while he checked their identifications.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am, the reason I asked you for your ID is because I came in here and I saw that you guys are speaking Spanish, which is very unheard of up here,\u201d O\u2019Neill said in the video.\n\nSuda was born in Texas and moved to Montana with her husband in 2014. Hernandez was born in California and has been living in Montana since 2010. Suda did not recognize O\u2019Neill as a colleague of her husband, nor did she say that her husband worked for the same agency. Havre is a city of nearly 10,000 people about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the U.S.-Canada border and near two Native American reservations. The city\u2019s population is mostly white and about 4% Hispanic, according to the U.S. Census.\n\nThe women filed their lawsuit in February, saying they were detained in violation of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against unreasonable search and seizures and the Fifth Amendment\u2019s equal protection clause. They are asking a judge to declare it is unconstitutional for the federal agency to detain anyone based on race, accent or language alone, to block the agency from doing so and to award them an unspecified amount for damages.\n\nThey say such stops are a pattern with the Havre sector of the Customs and Border Protection, and they cite other recent cases where Latino and Latinas were stopped.\n\n\u201cThey destroyed my life, but if I can help somebody else with this speaking out, I\u2019ll take it,\u201d Suda said.\n\nBorder officials and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office declined comment on Friday, citing the pending lawsuit.\n\nThe agency is seeking to dismiss the lawsuit, and a hearing is scheduled for Oct. 2. Attorneys for the agency say it has sovereign immunity against any damage claims, and that because the women were only stopped once after living there for years, there\u2019s no evidence there\u2019s any threat of it happening again to them.\n\nEver since the lawsuit was filed, Suda said the backlash has come in forms of angry faces on the street, backhanded comments made about her, high-volume confrontations and once a man shoved her. She said friends of border agents have told her to drop the lawsuit, but she did not file a complaint with the police because one woman who confronted her said she was friends with the police.\n\nOnce, a classmate of her young daughter called the girl an expletive in Spanish, Suda said. The potential threat to her children was a major factor in her decision to leave. She has a young son who is autistic and nonverbal, and she feared that something could happen to him and he wouldn\u2019t be able to tell her.\n\nHavre Police Chief Gabe Matosich did not return repeated calls for comment this week. Mayor Tim Solomon was out of the office on Friday and didn\u2019t immediately return a message.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "A woman suing Customs and Border Protection after being questioned when speaking Spanish says she has been harassed out of her Montana town", "authors": ["Matt Volz"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/montana-border-town.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
