This, perhaps, is the right moment to take a deeper look into the reasons of our fascination with the dark world of the Republic of Gilead.\n\nSince Gilead is run by Christian fundamentalists, the best way to begin is with theology.\n\nIn his Summa Theologica, philosopher Thomas Aquinas concludes that the blessed in the kingdom of heaven will see the punishments of the damned in order that their bliss be more delightful for them. Aquinas, of course, takes care to avoid the obscene implication that good souls in heaven can find pleasure in observing the terrible suffering of other souls, because good Christians should feel pity when they see suffering. So, will the blessed in heaven also feel pity for the torments of the damned? Aquinas\u2019s answer is no: not because they directly enjoy seeing suffering, but because they enjoy the exercise of divine justice.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

What makes Aquinas\u2019s formulation suspicious is the surplus enjoyment watching the pain of others secretly introduces: as if the simple pleasure of living in the bliss of heaven is not enough, and has to be supplemented by the enjoyment of being allowed to take a look at another\u2019s suffering \u2014 only in this way, the blessed souls \u201cmay enjoy their beatitude more thoroughly\u201d.\n\nWe can easily imagine the appropriate scene in heaven: when some blessed souls complain that the nectar served was not as tasty as the last time, and that blissful life up there is rather boring after all, angels serving the blessed souls would snap back: \u201cYou don\u2019t like it here? So take a look at how life is down there, at the other end, and maybe you will learn how lucky you are to be here!\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

And, incidentally, does the same not hold for our daily portion of Third World horrors \u2013 wars, starvations, violence \u2013 on TV screens? We need it to sustain the happiness of our consumerist heaven.\n\nAnd this brings us to Atwood\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale: a case of the direct \u201ccritical\u201d depiction of the oppressive atmosphere of an imagined conservative-fundamentalist rule. The novel and the television series allow us to dwell in the weird pleasure in fantasising a world of brutal patriarchal domination. Of course, nobody would openly admit the desire to live in such nightmarish world, but this assurance that we really don\u2019t want it makes fantasising about it, imagining all the details of this world, all the more pleasurable. Yes, we feel pain while experiencing this pleasure, but psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan\u2019s name for this pleasure-in-pain is jouissance.\n\nThe obverse of this ambiguity is the fundamental blindness of Atwood\u2019s tale for the limitations of our liberal-permissive universe: the entire story is an exercise in what American literary critic Fredric Jameson called \u201cnostalgia for the present\u201d \u2013 it is permeated by the sentimental admiration for our liberal-permissive present ruined by the new Christian-fundamentalist rule, and it never even approaches the question of what is wrong in this present so that it gave birth to the nightmarish Republic of Gilead. \u201cNostalgia for the present\u201d falls into the trap of ideology because it is blind for the fact that this present permissive Paradise is boring, and (exactly like the blessed souls in Paradise) it needs a look into the hell of religious fundamentalism to sustain itself.\n\nThis is ideology at its purest, ideology in the simple and brutal sense of legitimising the existing order and obfuscating its antagonisms. In exactly the same way, liberal critics of Trump and alt-right never seriously ask how our liberal society could give birth to Trump.\n\nIn this sense, the image of Donald Trump is also a fetish: the last thing a liberal sees before confronting class struggle. That\u2019s why liberals are so fascinated and horrified by Trump: to avoid the class topic. German philosopher Friedrich Hegel\u2019s motto, \u201cevil resides in the gaze which sees evil everywhere\u201d, fully applies here: the very liberal gaze which demonises Trump is also evil because it ignores how its own failures opened up the space for Trump\u2019s type of patriotic populism.", "description": "A well-crafted worldwide publicity campaign is raising expectations for The Testaments, Margaret Atwood\u2019s sequel to her Handmaid\u2019s Tale.
