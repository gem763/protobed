(AP) - George Springer turned a night of frustration into a ninth-inning celebration.\n\nSpringer hit a tiebreaking, three-run homer in the ninth inning, Gerrit Cole win his 13th straight decision and the Houston Astros beat the Kansas City Royals 4-1 Friday night to stop a three-game losing streak. The Astros maintained a 7 1/2-game lead over Oakland in the American League West.\n\nKyle Tucker singled with one out in the ninth off Heath Fillmyer (0-2) and pinch-hitter Michael Brantley walked. Josh Reddick struck out and Springer followed with his 35th homer. Springer was 0-for-4 and had struck out in his three previous at-bats.\n\n\u201cGeorge Springer is one swing away from having a great day every day,\u201d manager A J. Hinch said. \u201cHe hangs in there as well as anyone. He did have a tough night leading up to that point.\u201d\n\nSpringer also made a stellar catch on Alex Gordon\u2019s long drive to right in the fourth inning while the Royals\u2018 Hunter Dozier raced from first base all the way to third. Springer tossed the ball in and Dozier was easily doubled up at first.\n\n\u201cI got a good jump on it and it was getting close to the wall and I figured I might as well jump for it and was able to snowcone it,\u201d Springer said.\n\nCole (17-5) struck out 11 in eight innings, reaching double figures for the sixth straight start, and allowed an unearned run and four hits. He is 13-0 in 19 starts since losing to the Chicago White Sox on May 22, the longest streak of consecutive winning decisions in one season since Stephen Strasburg for Washington in 2013.\n\n\u201cGerrit was exceptionally nasty,\u201d Hinch said.\n\nCole called Springer the player of the game.\n\n\u201cI think it tells you a lot about a player when he\u2019s struggling at the plate and he\u2019s obviously frustrated with himself but he doesn\u2019t take it out on his defense. And, lo and behold, the biggest swing of the night comes from him in the ninth inning.\u201d\n\nRoberto Osuna worked around a two-out single for his 33rd save in 39 chances.\n\nJose Altuve hit his 28th home run in the first inning, breaking the Astros record for home runs by a second baseman, set by Jeff Kent in 2004. It was Altuve\u2019s 10th hit in 23 career at-bats (.435) against Danny Duffy but his first homer.\n\nDuffy allowed one run and four hits in six innings, throwing 54 of his 108 pitches in the first two innings.\n\nMeibrys Viloria hit a sacrifice fly in the eighth after Bubba Starling singled, stole second and took third on catcher Martin Maldonado\u2019s throwing error.\n\nGordon leaped near the left-field wall to grab Kyle\u2019s Tucker\u2019s drive in the second inning, then made a diving catch of Tucker\u2019s liner to the gap in the seventh.\n\n\u201cGordo sold out for that ball,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cIt\u2019s what he does. I think he\u2019s probably up there in triple digits in terms of catches made like that for me in my career.\u201d\n\nRoyals manager Ned Yost and Gordon, who was just called out on strikes, were ejected by plate umpire Lance Barrett after the seventh inning.It was the 47th of Yost\u2019s career but only the second for Gordon.\n\n\u201cI said something in the dugout when the inning was over,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t much, I didn\u2019t cuss at him. Just said one thing and then he threw me out.I didn\u2019t think I should\u2019ve been thrown out, but I probably shouldn\u2019t have said what I said\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAstros RHP Zack Greinke (15-5, 2.99 ERA) returns to his old home Saturday, matched with Royals LHP Mike Montgomery (3-8, 4.77 ERA). Since leaving the Royals after the 2010 season, Greinke started at Kauffman four times for four other teams. He had no decisions in 2012 with the Brewers and then the Angels, and losses in 2014 with the Dodgers and 2017 with the Diamondbacks. Greinke was 36-28 at Kauffman during seven seasons with Kansas City. Greinke is 5-1 with a 3.22 ERA in seven starts for the Astros after being obtained from the D-backs.\n\n_____\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "George Springer turned a night of frustration into a ninth-inning celebration.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dick Kaegel"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/astros_royals_baseball_17139_c0-138-3300-2062_s1770x1032.jpg?e1f564f8f6be3edbe5b27839a1e93c520c57831d", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
