Of the 39 people on board the ship, only five survived: the captain and four crew. As of Monday, one body is yet to be recovered.\n\nTruth Aquatics Inc., which owns the Conception, filed a lawsuit on Thursday \u2014 three days after the fire \u2014 arguing that it should not be liable to pay damages because the vessel was seaworthy when it caught fire.\n\nThe company and its owners, Glen and Dana Fritzler, using a maritime law from 1851, argued that their liability should be limited to the value of the boat's remains \u2014 which is nothing.\n\nMaritime legal experts called the move \"heartless,\" while also noting that it is not uncommon.\n\nYou can read the lawsuit here.\n\nThe Conception diving boat burns off Santa Cruz Island, California, on September 2, 2019. Santa Barbara County Fire Department/Handout via Reuters\n\nTruth Aquatics answered the criticism in a series of Facebook and Instagram comments on Friday and Saturday, in which it said that \"insurance companies\" and numerous unnamed \"stakeholders\" forced them to file the lawsuit.\n\nIn normal circumstances, they \"wouldn't even consider\" such a course of action, the company said.\n\nHere is the comment:\n\n\"Regarding the lawsuit, as we are learning, this is another unfortunate side of these tragedies. This wouldn't be something that we as a family would even consider, yet when something like this happens, insurance companies and numerous stakeholders convene and activate a legal checklist. The timing is on them.\n\n\"Our hearts and minds are on the tragedy and finding answers. We are a small-family run business. For 45 years we have never had an incident. We are grieving and reeling and just doing what we are advised by experts both on investigative and legal fronts.\n\n\"We understand there will be a lot of angst and anger around this event.\"\n\nTruth Aquatics did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for clarification into the \"legal checklist\" and the actions of their insurers and other stakeholders.\n\nPeople visit a memorial for the Conception victims' families at Truth Aquatics' offices in Santa Barbara on September 8, 2019, as FBI agents search the premises. Christian Monterrosa/AP\n\nThe comments came as the FBI, as well as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the U.S. Coast Guard opened a criminal investigation into the company over the fire.\n\nAuthorities served warrants and searched Truth Aquatics' offices and the company's two remaining boats on Sunday, but made no arrests, according to the Los Angeles Times and Associated Press.\n\nThe US Coast Guard said last week that the Conception had passed all its safety tests before it set sail.\n\nHowever, a preliminary investigation suggested that the boat lacked safety measures, including somebody whose job it was to stay awake in case of fires or other problems, the LA Times reported, citing unnamed law-enforcement sources.\n\nRead more: A family of 5 on a birthday trip, a father-daughter duo who loved diving, and a marine biologist leading the scuba expedition are believed to be among the 34 California boat fire victims\n\nJJ Lambert and Jenna Marsala hug after at a makeshift memorial near Truth Aquatics' offices in Santa Barbara on September 2, 2019.
