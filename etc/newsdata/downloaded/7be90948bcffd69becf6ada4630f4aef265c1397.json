Poultry purists have flocked to Popeyes in such a frenzy that the long lines have even caused traffic accidents.\n\nBut pull your car back into the garage and save yourself a phone call to Geico. There are other ways to get a chicken sandwich.\n\nThe Fast-Food Route\n\nIf you can\u2019t be bothered with brining, flouring and frying a sandwich that you\u2019ll eat in under 90 seconds, congratulations \u2015 you\u2019re human. Fast-food options for fried chicken sandwiches abound, but there\u2019s really only one clear competitor with Popeyes and Chick-fil-A when it comes to national chains, and that\u2019s Shake Shack. Sure, McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, Wendy\u2019s, Arby\u2019s and KFC all carry passable fried chicken sandwiches, but the Chick\u2019n Shack makes them all seem like wet garbage by comparison.\n\nIntroduced in 2016, the Chick\u2019n Shack is made from 100% all-natural and antibiotic-free chicken breast with lettuce, pickles and buttermilk herb mayo, and it\u2019s been lauded as better than Chick-fil-A. And now that Shake Shack is becoming increasingly ubiquitous with its 130 U.S. locations, it\u2019s not as hard to get your hands on as it used to be.\n\nIf you're lookin' for a chicken sandwich (without the beef \ud83d\ude09), you know where to find us. pic.twitter.com/2wtV2POvFf \u2014 SHAKE SHACK (@shakeshack) August 19, 2019\n\nThe Homemade Route\n\nIf you\u2019ve got bigger ambitions, roll up your sleeves and make a chicken sandwich yourself. But prepare yourself for the endeavor you\u2019re about to pursue. As someone who doesn\u2019t mind spending weeks nurturing a sourdough starter or taking three days to make the components of a Momofuku layer cake, I\u2019m happy to spend ridiculous amounts of time in the kitchen. However, if I went through the time-consuming and messy process of making one lone chicken sandwich that would be gobbled down in seconds, I might never cook again. So take heed: If you do this, invite a horde of friends to enjoy the feast with you, because making a single sandwich is a fool\u2019s journey.\n\nEach of the recipes below varies, but keep in mind these key tips to making the best fried chicken:\n\nStart with a brine: Sure, you can skip this step, but you can also choose to throw all your money into a river. (Don\u2019t skip this step.) As James Beard Award-winning chef RJ Cooper has previously told HuffPost, he puts pieces of raw chicken in a buttermilk brine and refrigerates the meat for 12 hours before coating it in flour and frying it. His mixture contains buttermilk, fresh sage, rosemary, thyme and garlic, but you can use whatever you want to replicate the fast-food sandwich of your choice, whether it\u2019s spicy or mild.\n\nSeason your flour: The brine will keep your chicken moist and give it some flavor, but the flour you dredge it in is the first flavor bomb that\u2019ll hit your tongue. Make sure it\u2019s seasoned well with salt and pepper, but kick it up with spices like garlic powder, paprika, cayenne and anything else you want.\n\nFry it low and slow: In case no one\u2019s told you, burned chicken skin is not delicious. Nor is raw chicken flesh. To avoid both, keep your oil around 320 degrees Fahrenheit and use a meat thermometer to ensure the inside of the chicken is cooked to 165 degrees Fahrenheit, as per guidelines from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nCondiments are everything: If you cook your chicken to perfection, it\u2019ll taste great naked. But everyone can benefit from accessorizing, so take some time to prepare a homemade ranch sauce, some fresh slaw or whatever floats your boat. The recipes below will give you inspiration.\n\nNow get frying, and see if you can give Popeyes a run for its money.", "description": "Who needs to wait in line when you can make one better than fast-food chains?", "authors": ["Senior Editor Of Food", "Style"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6552e2250000710a7294f8.jpeg?cache=6ftePenQ3L&ops=1778_1000"}
