He paid him 270,000 yuan (\u00a330,000) up front and an additional 500,000 yuan (\u00a355,000) when the deed was done.\n\nYet, Kangsheng offered Yang Guasheng 200,000 yuan (\u00a322,000) up front and then a further 500,000 yuan (\u00a355,000) after the job was complete.\n\n(Image: Universal Images Group)\n\nHowever, the fourth hitman hired the fifth - and final - hitman, Ling Xiansi, who agreed to do the job for 100,000 yuan (\u00a311,000), a court was told.\n\nXiansi met with estate agent Wei Miu in Guangxi but, instead of going through with the murder, told him about the plot and the outsourcing.\n\nAnd Xiansi faked the businessman's death by gagging him and sending photos to Guasheng, his hitman boss.\n\nThe pictures eventually reached the original client, Youhui, in 2013 and all involved considered the murder was done.\n\nBut police were notified at some stage and investigated the plot.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Tan was sentenced to five years in prison, the five hitmen were sentenced to between two and four years in jail.\n\nThey were each convicted of attempted murder after a lengthy trial.", "description": "Tan Youhui wanted his business competitor Wei Miu dead in Guangxi, China, but the sinister murder plot sensationally backfired", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Nanning Intermediate People'S Court", "Universal Images Group"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12522555.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Youth-brandishing-a-gun-London-2008.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
