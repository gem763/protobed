But anyone familiar with the brand will also know that it's going to cost a pretty penny.\n\nBang & Olufsen's New Headphones Make Me Feel Like A Peasant Bang & Olufsen just announced a new pair of noise-cancelling headphones that are so hot that I'm beginning to question my sexuality. Say 'hej' to the Beoplay H9, the latest flagship eardrum ticklers from the luxury tech brand. It combines style and sound with a price tag that will have you weeping into your two-minute noodles. Read more\n\nB&O has stated that it wanted to create a soundbar that provides people with a full cinematic experience without the need for multiple detached speakers.\n\nThe Beosound Stage has eleven speaker drivers - each with its own 50-watt amplifier.\n\nThe centre channel drivers include four 4-inch woofers which will apparently reduce distortion and improve the bass.\n\nThe mids are covered by tw 1.5-inch mid-range drivers and a 0.75-inch dome tweeter.\n\nThe left and right sides each have a 1.5-inch midrange and 0.75-inch tweeters that are positioned closely together and 45-degrees off-axis in order to create three-dimensional sound.\n\nIt also includes Dolby Atmos and five different listening modes (TV, movie, music, night and non) that can then be further customised with B&O's 'ToneTouch' equaliser. This lets users feel their way through the sound settings.\n\nThe Beosound Stage is also capable of multi-room streaming and is compatible with Chromecast (which is built in), bluetooth and Apple AirPlay 2.\n\n\u201cWe created Beosound Stage as a powerful soundbar that doesn\u2019t rely on a subwoofer or satellites to create an immersive experience. The first time you hear Beosound Stage, the impact of the deep, powerful sound hits you immediately, and the simple minimalistic Scandinavian design makes it stand out like a piece of furniture. It is simply clean, elegant and powerful\u201d, says Christoffer \u00d8stergaard Poulsen, Vice President of Product Management at Bang & Olufsen.\n\nThe Besound Stage will be landing in Australia in early November.\n\nAll four models are sleek and sexy, with the black and silver models being best able to fit into any home.\n\nHowever, the oak as bronze varieties are absolutely stunning from a design perspective. They're bold, and reminiscent of Mad Men-era architecture. They won't fit into every home decore setup, but would be gorgeous in the right environments.\n\nBoth the Silver Frame with Black Fabric cover and the Bronze Tone Frame with Warm Taupe Kvadrat Fabric cover will have an RRP of $2,500, with the Smoked Oak frame and Grey Kvadrat fabric cover models coming in at $3,500.", "description": "Bang & Olufsen has announced its first soundbar, the Beosound Stage, in the lead up to IFA.
