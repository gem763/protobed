Yovanovitch adamantly pushed back on those accusations during testimony before investigators on Friday. Kent will also likely be asked about those assertions.\n\nAD\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Rachael Bade\n\n7:30 a.m.: Bolton declines comment on testimony that he was alarmed by Giuliani\n\nJohn Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, declined to comment Tuesday on reports that Fiona Hill, the White House\u2019s former top Russia adviser, told impeachment investigators Monday that he was alarmed by Giuliani\u2019s activities in Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nHill testified behind closed doors Monday that Bolton was furious over Giuliani\u2019s politically motivated activities in Ukraine, according to two officials familiar with her testimony. She recounted how Bolton likened the former New York mayor to a \u201chand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up,\u201d one of these people said, after Bolton learned about Giuliani\u2019s Ukraine campaign.\n\nAD\n\nHouse investigators are now considering summoning Bolton, who was Hill\u2019s direct superior at the National Security Council, according to people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to discuss closed-door deliberations.\n\n\u2014 Anne Gearan\n\n7:15 a.m.: RNC highlights effort aimed at House Democrats in swing districts.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel highlighted the RNC\u2019s expanded efforts to target Democrats in swing districts for their support of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDemocrats in Congress are hiding their baseless impeachment \u2018hearings\u2019 behind closed doors, but they can\u2019t hide from their constituents!\u201d McDaniel wrote in a tweet that included a link to a Washington Examiner piece detailing a $2.3 million RNC effort that includes online ads with a \u201cStop the Madness\u201d theme targeting 30 House Democrats.\n\nAD\n\n7:10 a.m.: Jordan takes aim at Hunter Biden\n\nAs ABC was airing its Hunter Biden interview, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a key Trump ally, appeared on Fox News, where he criticized Biden\u2019s tenure on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president.\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t fair. This wasn\u2019t proper. This wasn\u2019t right,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cWe just know that this stuff smells.\u201d\n\nJordan also took issue with Hunter Biden\u2019s assessment in the interview about whether he would have been offered the position on the board of Burisma Holdings if his last name weren\u2019t Biden.\n\nAD\n\nHunter Biden told ABC \u201cprobably not.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot probably not, definitely not,\u201d said Jordan, who went on to criticize the Democratic-led impeachment proceedings as \u201can all-out attack on the president.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n6:30 a.m.: Hunter Biden concedes mistake but not an \u2018ethical lapse\u2019\n\nHunter Biden conceded that it might have been a mistake to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president but insisted that he did not have an \u201cethical lapse\u201d during a television interview that aired Tuesday.\n\n\u201cDid I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah,\u201d Biden said on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d referring to the fallout from his service. \u201cBut did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden, whose tenure on the company, Burisma Holdings, began in 2014, said he didn\u2019t foresee that his work would become central to a political controversy. Trump and Giuliani have pressed the idea that Joe Biden\u2019s efforts as vice president to remove a Ukranian prosecutor was tied to the fact that he had examined the company.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat I regret is not taking into account that there would be a Rudy Giuliani and a president of the United States that would be listening to this, this ridiculous conspiracy idea, which has ... been completely debunked by everyone,\u201d Hunter Biden said.\n\n\u201cI gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That\u2019s where I made the mistake,\u201d he added.\n\nRead more here.\n\n6 a.m.: Democrats to huddle Tuesday night on status of inquiry\n\nComing off a two-week recess, House Democrats plan to huddle at 6 p.m. Tuesday to discuss the status of the impeachment inquiry, according to a Democratic aide.\n\nIt\u2019s been three weeks since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced the launch of the formal inquiry.
