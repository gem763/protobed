The new Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who took over in July, has called these targets \u201ca relic of the past,\u201d and he is now trying to convince his country\u2019s partners to reduce them, starting in 2021.\n\nFor 2019, Greece is going to meet its primary surplus target \u201cmore or less,\u201d Peter Dolman, IMF mission chief for Greece told reporters in Athens on Friday. But there is a gap for 2020, and the question is what the quality of the measures taken to fill this gap will be, he said.\n\nCutting public investments is not a quality measure and the country should improve its sales-tax compliance and broaden its tax base to create more fiscal space for social policies and tax cuts, Dolman said.\n\nThe fund forecasts that Greece\u2019s growth rate for both 2019 and 2020 will be around 2%. It \u201cwill take another decade and a half for real per capita incomes to reach pre-crisis levels,\u201d the IMF said in the statement.\n\nTo support growth, the new government \u201cshould use its political mandate and improving investor sentiment to deploy a full range of policy tools and overcome long-standing vested interests,\u201d it said.\n\nFixing banks must be a top priority for the new government given that they are a misfiring engine. Apart from the implementation of an Italian-style project to massively cut bad loans, which is about to be approved by European authorities, the government should take further actions to make judicial processes more efficient and improve insolvency law, according to the IMF.\n\nWhile Mitsotakis\u2019s administration \u201cdeserves credit for unblocking privatization and pushing through business deregulation and digitalization,\u201d much of the needed structural transformation of the Greek economy still lies ahead, the IMF said.\n\nThe IMF expects Greece\u2019s public debt-to-GDP ratio to decline over the next decade with relatively low liquidity risks in the medium term also noting that the country has a large cash buffer to use if needed. But, in terms of debt sustainability analysis \u201cwe think the long-term sustainability is not assured,\u201d Dolman said.", "description": "IMF Says Greece Needs More Fiscal Space From European Partners", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic42576dd141714d1c38b52e93e2e0817b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
