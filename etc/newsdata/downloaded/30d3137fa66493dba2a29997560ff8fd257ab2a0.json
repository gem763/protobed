From his kick-heavy approach under Wanderlei Silva\u2019s wing to his more boxing-centric tactics since working with Luiz Doria (Junior Dos Santos\u2019 boxing coach), Maia is more than competent at throwing all four of his limbs.\n\nSure, his initial foray of striking with high-level opposition wasn\u2019t exactly his best stretch at middleweight (otherwise known as Maia\u2019s \u201cK-1 era\u201d to hardcores), but that provided a useful experience for the Brazilian to work through any discomfort or unknowns in his game. And regardless of what weight Maia was operating at, he has always wielded a deceptively heavy left cross that Ben Askren will need to be aware of.\n\nAskren, who made his name in the wrestling world by becoming one of two men to earn the Dan Hodge Trophy twice (amidst many other accolades), is no stranger to having an on-paper disadvantage when striking on the feet.\n\nThe former Mizzou Tiger makes no qualms about using his striking as more of a means to an end \u2013 though one has to wonder if Askren\u2019s attitude has changed since his last fight.\n\nIn Askren\u2019s defense, he\u2019s shown an ability to absorb big shots and damage throughout his career, but \u2013 perfect flying knee or not \u2013 you cannot rely too heavily on your chin at the upper echelons of MMA. Thankfully for Askren, he seemed to have taken the knockout loss to Jorge Masvidal well (all things considered), not appearing to let it affect his near-unshakable confidence.\n\nThat said, Askren\u2019s confidence, at least for me, will be the thing worth watching for in this fight.\n\nAskren arguably lets his confidence fuel him on the feet, showing little issue when having to stalk forward into turbulent territory, occasionally throwing spinning attacks when feeling in stride. Still, with wrestling being Askren\u2019s ultimate goal in mind, fighters who can offer up something in the counter-wrestling department have typically been the American standout\u2019s toughest tests.\n\nNext point of interest: Wrestling vs. presenting", "description": "MMA Junkie fight analyst Dan Tom takes a closer look at the UFC Singapore headliner between ground specialists Ben Askren and Demian Maia.", "authors": ["Dan Tom", "Simon Samano", "Abbey Subhan", "Mma Junkie Staff", "The Blue Corner", "Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "Simon Head"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ben-askren-demian-maia.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
