While the movie is a barrel of laughs like any other Akshay Kumar comedy, the viewers couldn't help but feel a bit confused by the story line.\n\nHere's what made the movie work on the box-office so far:\n\nA Houesfull Of Laughter\n\nThe last time Akshay Kumar managed to evoke such amount of laughter was in 2012\u2019s Housefull 2. Sajid Khan gets Akshay & he knows how to get the maximum out of him. Facial comedy is one of the hardest things to do & Akshay is the saving grace here. In the first half, both Akshay Kumar and Ritesh Deshmukh stood equal when it came to timing and dialogues. But Housefull 4 is all about Akshay Kumar.\n\nReincarnation at its best\n\nSince the movie is based around reincarnation, the makers have exhibited an incredible show of opulence and indulgence of the bygone past. Bringing to life a seemingly realistic feel, certain shots such as aerial shots of the medieval city, that display the city\u2019s magnificent-self - full of incredible water-falls, and intimidating giant-pillars \u2013 making for an exceptional cinematic experience. With the movie transporting into flashback and present day at a brisk pace, the transitions going from the palace to the original day is seamless, and takes you from one place to the other in a thoroughly enjoyable manner.\n\nMust-watch\n\nWith endless possibilities of new ideas and powerful next-gen hardware capable of making it real, the visual-effects leave an everlasting effect on the minds of the audience with beautiful recreation of animals featured in the film. For instance, the movie has a Tarantula, who despite being present in a brief scene sends the viewer on a laughter riot. Consisting of a vast percentage of CGI makes the movie spell bounding owing to the complexity of simulations involved.\n\nWhy VFX?\n\nOver the past decade, VFX has branched out to newer avenues in the Indian Cinema. Riding on these technological marvels, they\u2019ve integrated live-action and generated images to create environments that do absolute justice in ensuring the utmost realism and authenticity. What one sees in Housefull 4 too is an abundance of dangerous, expensive, scenes which one would consider impossible to capture on film. Here too, technology has raised the entertainment quotient in a manner that is sure to enthrall the audiences.\n\nSo like it or hate it , you can't ignore this laugh riot.", "description": "Back on the big screen after three years; the Housefull franchise returned on Diwali weekend with its 4th installment and wow, what a watch it was.
