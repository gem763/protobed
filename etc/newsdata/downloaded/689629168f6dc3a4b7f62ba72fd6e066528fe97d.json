But low blood pressure can also be bad thing. For most people, low BP is nothing to worry about. But, for some people, chronically lower than normal BP can signal health problems. I want to show you how to identify the symptoms of dangerously low BP, and how you can safely elevate it to healthy levels\u2026 without a prescription.\n\nSymptoms of Low Blood Pressure\n\nDizziness or lightheadedness\n\nNausea\n\nFainting (syncope)\n\nDehydration and unusual thirst\n\nLack of concentration\n\nBlurred vision\n\nCold, clammy, pale skin\n\nRapid, shallow breathing\n\nFatigue\n\nDepression\n\nCauses of Low Blood Pressure\n\nWe doctors are constantly checking blood pressure. Every doctor visit \u2013 whether you\u2019re sick or having a general checkup \u2013 usually begins with a blood pressure check. Even my dentist checks my blood pressure! The ideal blood pressure is 120/80 . Anything within 10 points, above or below either measurement, is considered within the normal range. Therefore, 130/90 or higher is considered borderline high BP (hypertension) and 110/70 or lower is borderline low BP (hypotension). This constant checking of your blood pressure is a good thing. The number of people with heart disease or diabetes is only getting larger each year, and tracking a person\u2019s blood pressure is a good way to get a pulse on a person\u2019s overall health. Most doctors \u2013 myself included \u2013 don\u2019t immediately view it as a bad thing when a patient has low BP. But chronic low BP can be considered dangerous if it\u2019s causing these noticeable signs and symptoms:If you have a history of low BP and you experience any of the above regularly, talk to you doctor immediately. These symptoms can be indicative of larger health problems.So what causes low blood pressure? According to the American Heart Association (AHA), there are host of underlying causes but these three are the most frequent:\n\nPrescription medications: Several drugs can lower your BP, most commonly drugs that treat hypertension, diuretics, beta blockers, drugs that combat Parkinson\u2019s disease, drugs that treat erectile dysfunction, and tricyclic antidepressants. The AHA also warns that some over-the-counter drugs can lower BP when taken in combination with hypertension medications. Always read labels and consult your doctor if you have questions.\n\nSeveral drugs can lower your BP, most commonly drugs that treat hypertension, diuretics, beta blockers, drugs that combat Parkinson\u2019s disease, drugs that treat erectile dysfunction, and tricyclic antidepressants.

Existing heart problems: Some heart conditions can lead to low BP, such as low heart rate, heart attacks, heart failure, or problems with heart valves. As a result of any of those, your heart may not be strong enough to pump blood efficiently through your entire body.\n\nSome heart conditions can lead to low BP, such as low heart rate, heart attacks, heart failure, or problems with heart valves. As a result of any of those, your heart may not be strong enough to pump blood efficiently through your entire body. Endocrine system problems: If your adrenal glands are releasing too many or too little of the body\u2019s many hormones, the whole body is affected. Underactive thyroid, parathyroid disease, low blood sugar, and adrenal insufficiency (known as Addison\u2019s disease) can contribute to chronic low BP. Doctors often fail to rule out possible adrenal gland problems. Be sure to discuss this as a possible cause.\n\nOther possible causes of low blood pressure are allergic reactions, severe infection, and deficiencies in vitamin B-12 and folic acid . This is why I take those seemingly unrelated symptoms of low BP very seriously. The health problems at the root of it are far bigger than your blood pressure itself.\n\nHow to Naturally Elevate Your Blood Pressure\n\nBefore I get into any tips about elevating your BP, understand that your goal is NOT to have high BP. Think of your goal to raise your BP like balancing a scale \u2013 you don\u2019t want either side to be flat on the ground or high in the air. So if you\u2019re holding out hope that I was going to recommend that you go on a pizza-and-cheeseburger diet to raise your BP, think again! But I do have some suggestions that are easy and safe. With all of these, keep a regular watch on how much they increase your BP and don\u2019t overdo them for that very reason. Perhaps the simplest way to increase BP is to mix and drink. All you have to do is put a half teaspoon of sea salt into 8 ounces of water, stir, and drink. Drink no more than one glass a day. I suggest that you also add some lemon juice to give it some taste.has been used as a sweetener and as a natural medicine for thousands of years. In fact, stores of licorice roots were found in King Tut\u2019s tomb when it was unearthed. While licorice has been long used to relieve indigestion and acid reflux, it also can safely increase BP. The root\u2019s power comes in many forms \u2013 extracts, tinctures, chewable tablets, topical creams, capsules, wafers, tea, and powder (no processed, sugary licorice candy!). Whichever you choose, follow dosage recommendations on the product\u2019s label. If you feel like it\u2019s not doing the trick, talk with your doctor first before increasing dosage. Personally, one of my favorite natural sources of energy can also help raise BP: Ocean-sourced\n\n. It\u2019s a fancy name for what it really is \u2013 concentrated minerals (sodium, magnesium, & calcium among dozens more) derived from evaporating pools of ocean water. I put several drops of it in my water and it gives me a boost of energy that lasts for hours. For your low BP, the naturally occurring salt in ocean water can help slowly elevate BP. Look for it at your local health store or online. Finally, I have a few suggestions for activities or behaviors that can help regulate your sodium levels, which can, in turn, help regulate your blood pressure:. It dehydrates your body. Instead, drink plenty of fluids, especially if you fall victim to a cold or flu during the winter.to improve blood flow. Rehydrate your body with electrolytes during and after exercising.. As much as you probably love a long, hot shower or bath during the winter, it also dehydrates your body. That\u2019s why your fingers and toes look like raisins if you\u2019re in the shower or bathtub too long. Follow up your showers and baths with a moisturizing cream. I believe that the plagues of heart disease and diabetes have conditioned us to think that high blood pressure is the only bad blood pressure. True, it\u2019s much more widespread and more life-threatening than low BP, but don\u2019t be lulled into a false sense of security by chronic low blood pressure. The good news is that it\u2019s safe and easy to elevate BP to normal levels without a prescription. And you can be guaranteed that every time you see a doctor, your blood pressure will be checked so you\u2019ll always know exactly where your BP stands.\n\nReferences\n\nAmerican Heart Association. \u201c Low Blood Pressure - When Blood Pressure Is Too Low \u201d Last Review October 2016.
