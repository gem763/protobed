It was a really good performance.\u201d\n\nBelgium needed only nine minutes to take the lead with their first serious foray into Scottish territory.\n\nMoments after Scotland had a free kick at the other end, Belgium counter-attacked in deadly fashion with Dries Mertens driving forward before finding De Bruyne who rolled a pass across the pitch for Lukaku to score with ease.\n\nIt completely knocked the stuffing out of the Scots and it was 2-0 in the 24th minute when De Bruyne whipped in a cross and Vermaelen arrived to side-foot past keeper David Marshall.\n\nThe game was effectively over already and Scotland\u2019s night got even worse in the 32nd minute when De Bruyne swung over a corner and an unmarked Alderweireld headed in off the crossbar.\n\nIt was a passion-less display by Scotland and Belgium could afford the luxury of playing the rest of the match in cruise control as they claimed another easy three points.\n\nDe Bruyne saved the best goal to last as he planted a first-time shot past Marshall after being played in by Lukaku.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nScotland dropped to second from bottom in the table after Cyprus beat San Marino 4-0 to move above the Scots by a point.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to try and sugarcoat a 4-0 defeat,\u201d Scotland manager Steve Clarke said.\n\n\u201cI thought we started the game well but we conceded a goal from our free kick. Then we conceded two goals from set plays and you can\u2019t afford three soft goals.\u201d", "description": "Belgium kept their 100 percent record intact in Euro 2020 qualifying Group I with a Kevin de Bruyne-inspired 4-0 demolition of a disappointing Scotland side at a subdued Hampden Park on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428093477&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881V3", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
