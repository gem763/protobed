Slater, assistant director in charge of the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office, which was involved in the investigation into Rogers. \u201cInstead of using donations to provide assistance and support to military veterans, as he advertised, Rogers used the money to benefit himself and his associates.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Rogers did not respond to a request for comment. No one else has been charged.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

While promising to fight Barack Obama and illegal immigration, internal emails and documents showed that Rogers and his associates instead funneled the money back to themselves.\n\nACU officials emphasized that they played no role in Rogers\u2019 scams and severed ties with him in 2012.\n\nUntil recently, PACs such as those operated by Rogers operated with little oversight from the federal government. But the Department of Justice began to take steps to crack down earlier this year. It sentenced another man, William Tierney, to two years in prison for operating multiple PACs that solicited money for charitable-sounding causes, such as fighting cancer, but did not use the money raised for those purposes.\n\nRogers\u2019 guilty plea represents a step forward for enforcement, said Larry Noble, former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission. \u201cOne fraud case doesn\u2019t make a change of policy, but hopefully this is just the beginning,\u201d Noble said. The DOJ\u2019s ability to charge PAC operators with fraud or tax evasion is one of the federal government\u2019s only avenues for cracking down on so-called scam PACs, he said, \u201cso it is significant if the Department of Justice is going to start going after these people.\u201d\n\nRogers, his consulting firm and a PAC he operated called the Conservative StrikeForce were sued in 2014 by Ken Cuccinelli, a Republican candidate for governor in Virginia who now serves as acting director of citizenship and immigration services in the Trump administration. Cuccinelli\u2019s suit alleged that Rogers raised more than $2 million by claiming he was assisting the Republican\u2019s campaign but spent almost nothing to support it. In 2017, the FBI raided Rogers\u2019 Annapolis, Maryland, office. The criminal charges against Rogers stemmed from his involvement in the 2013 Virginia elections.\n\nIn addition to misleading donors, Rogers also created fake invoices for at least four PACs that he controlled, including Conservative Majority Fund, court documents show. Rogers worked \u201cwith others in his inner circle, particularly telemarketing, email and direct mail vendors, to cause the creation of fake invoices.\u201d Rogers would pay the invoices to firms under his control or controlled by associates who would \u201ckick money back\u201d to him, according to the court documents.\n\nCourt filings also show that Rogers used two of the PACs he controlled, Conservative Majority Fund and Tea Party Majority, to pay debts the Conservative StrikeForce incurred as a result of Cuccinelli\u2019s lawsuit. The two committees paid about $249,000 to Conservative StrikeForce, violating federal campaign contribution limits. In addition, Rogers filed FEC reports \u201cin order to conceal from donors and the federal government the true nature of those payments,\u201d according to court documents.\n\nRogers agreed to pay $491,299 in restitution to victims of the fraud scheme, as well as a forfeiture judgment of $208,954 as part of his plea agreement. He is scheduled to be sentenced in January.\n\nThis story was co-published with ProPublica.\n\n", "description": "Kelley Rogers, who raised millions with red-meat conservative pitches but spent little on politics, admits he cheated donors.", "authors": ["Maggie Severns"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/17/e3/eee9809d4e3d8b0764bd10dcddb1/190806-justice-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
