The statistics laid bare how defence is now turning to attack at a rate slower than any under his regime.\n\nLast January Tottenham beat Watford at Wembley 2-1, with Toby Alderweireld playing the most passes, 81 in total, with a success rate of 73. On Saturday, Alderweireld again had the lion's share of ball and hit 114 passes, 90 accurately. Vertonghen, his defensive partner, had an even greater rate of increase - with 108 passes on Saturday, compared to just 66 last season.\n\nFor Watford, it was a gift and poor Harry Winks - whose statistics were almost identical, 77 passes on Saturday compared with 75 last season - was left with an impossible job getting the ball moving forward.", "description": "Danny Rose and Dele Alli slumped to the turf in apparent exhaustion as the whistle blew on Saturday's unconvincing crack-papering job at Tottenham Hotspur stadium.", "authors": ["Tom Morgan", "Sports News Correspondent", "Keith Hackett", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/20/TELEMMGLPICT000213511155-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqq0hXPkI_GX3QDYmEw99JfE5fpva0KquvcSbylcSlZ84.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
