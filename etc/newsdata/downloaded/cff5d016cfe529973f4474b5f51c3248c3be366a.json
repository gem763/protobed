The European soccer federation prohibits political statements in stadiums.\n\nBut Turkish players lined up again to show a military salute after Kaan Ayhan's late equalizer in Paris. Captain Burak Yilmaz was joined by goalkeeper Mert G\u00fcnok and several other outfield players in giving the salute toward the crowd - in apparent support of the Turkish forces involved in the country's invasion of Kurdish-held regions in northern Syria.\n\nDefender Merih Demiral urged Ayhan to salute, too, leading to what looked like a heated discussion between the two, but the goal-scorer desisted and made his way back to the pitch.\n\nAyhan and Turkey striker Kenan Karaman both play for German side Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, which had issued a statement after Friday's game to distance itself from \"politically motivated acts.\"\n\n\"Both players stand for values that the club lives by,\" D\u00fcsseldorf sporting director Lutz Pfannenstiel said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "PARIS (AP) - Turkish players defied UEFA with another military salute in Turkey's 1-1 draw with France in their European Championship qualifier on...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
