I don\u2019t play a ton of Pokemon, but I do enjoy the universe and I love learning more about the creatures in it. So, Here\u2019s Another Pokemon! It\u2019s Gourgeist!\n\nGourgeist Details\n\nType: Ghost/Grass\n\nAverage Height: 2' 04\" - 5' 07\"\n\nAverage Weight: 20.9 - 39kg.\n\nFirst Added In Generation VI\n\nIf this Jack fella did see Gourgeist in his town on Halloween, he was probably afraid of it honestly. These creatures will wander through cities and towns during full moons, singing eerie songs. That is spooky enough, but it gets worse. According to Pokedex entries listed on Bulbapedia, people who hear these songs are cursed. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any info on what happens to people who are cursed, which could be a bad sign for those folks. Or it might be a really lame curse that only makes your bread go stale faster or something like that. Annoying, sure, but not something that kills you or your family.\n\nGourgeist will also grab prey with its arms, which are those orange bits that look like pieces of long hair attached to the top head. When it grabs its prey it will sometimes sing a happy little song while it watches its prey suffer and squirm. The Pokedex entries don\u2019t specify if it eats humans, but considering this universe and how dark it is sometimes, I wouldn\u2019t be shocked to hear Gourgiest is out there killing orphans or babies.\n\nSome Gourgeist can unlock a secret ability called Insomnia. I assume this is why it is wandering the streets, late at night, while singing creepy songs. When I can\u2019t sleep I usually watch YouTube videos about old LEGO sets or eat a big bowl of cereal. Less creepy and more sad, really.\n\nFavourite Fan Art\n\nThis is such a perfect fit. And the whole piece is so well done too. I want more images like this. Classic paintings with Pokemon added into them.\n\nRandom Facts\n\nGourgeist comes in four variations: Small, average, large and supersize. Different sized Gourgeist can have different abilities and bigger ones even sound different.\n\nThis is one of the only two Pokemon in all of the games that can learn the ability \u201cTrick-Or-Treat.\u201d\n\nI looked around, but nobody seems to know what is inside the pumpkin part of this creature. Maybe that\u2019s for the best...\n\nBest Comment From Last Week\n\nWait wait wait, so that essentially means that human souls are Pok\u00e9mon? What the actual fuck, I\u2019m not OK with this. It also implies that there\u2019s no afterlife in the Pokeverse and that is an incredibly unsettling implication for a franchise made for kids. -Stunkydunk\n\nThere is an afterlife, it just sucks. In Pokemon, when you die you, you become a ghost stuck in a fucking tree stump or balloon or something like that. And then you wander around getting captured and traded until the universe ends.", "description": "Every Pokemon is interesting and worth talking about.
