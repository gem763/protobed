Now he\u2019s a case study on worries over Beijing\u2019s influence.", "language": "en", "text": "The investigation is widely seen as a potential deep dive into pro-Beijing networks and influence-peddling in Australia, which is struggling to balance its trade dependency with China and its older military and intelligence-sharing ties with the United States.\n\nAD\n\nIt also illustrates an awkward consequence of the explosion of Chinese capital around the world. Western countries have embraced the wealthy foreign investors from China but are discovering that many remain loyal to the Chinese Communist Party and its political agenda.\n\nAD\n\nBeijing\u2019s influence is becoming a particularly acute concern in Australia, which has a large Chinese population and whose mineral and natural gas companies have major export markets in China.\n\nFor the past two years, the suspected influence by Beijing has been an almost constant source of political and media debate \u2014 including intimidation tactics by pro-Beijing students from China on campuses, and politicians from all sides who may have been links to Chinese investment interests.\n\nAD\n\nTrump sought help with Mueller probe. He saw a friend in Australia\u2019s Morrison.\n\n\u201cTrying to collect 140 million [Australian dollars] is an exercise that\u2019s well and good,\u201d said David Chaikin, a former head of law enforcement and security in the international division of Australia\u2019s attorney general\u2019s department. \u201cBut the national security is worth more than 140 million.\u201d\n\nA court has frozen Huang\u2019s remaining Australian assets, and his Australian visa has been canceled. Huang, also known as Changran Huang, now appears to live in Hong Kong, where he owns a $66 million apartment, according to court documents.\n\nAD\n\nHaving made a fortune in property development in the Chaoshan area of southern China, Huang moved to Australia in 2013 and invested in shopping malls, apartment buildings and offices.\n\nAD\n\nHe bought a beautiful house in one of Sydney\u2019s most affluent suburbs, became a benefactor to prominent charities and educational institutions, and was appointed leader of several groups close to China\u2019s United Front Work Department, a group with close ties to Beijing\u2019s leaders that seeks to muzzle any opposition to the one-party state and its policies, said Alex Joske, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\n\nHuang\u2019s wealth and generous political donations made him a popular guest at fundraisers with senior politicians, including Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister from 2015 to 2018, Julie Bishop, the foreign minister from 2013 to 2018, and Bill Shorten, the former leader of the opposition Labor Party. Shorten attended Huang\u2019s daughter\u2019s wedding in Sydney three years ago.\n\nAD\n\nHuang\u2019s high profile and access to powerful people attracted the interest of the intelligence services, too.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2016, a Labor Party politician, Sam Dastyari, warned Huang that his phone was likely being monitored by government agencies, a warning that ended Dastyari\u2019s political career when the call was revealed by the Sydney Morning Herald a year later.\n\nHuang\u2019s involvement with pro-Beijing organizations and contact with senior politicians has fed speculation that he was pushing policies favored by the Chinese government.\n\nEven Turnbull, when he was prime minister, suggested that Huang\u2019s donations had led Dastyari to side with China in its international disputes over the South China Sea, where China\u2019s claims of full sovereignty are strongly opposed by the United States and its allies.\n\nAD\n\nHuang could not be reached for comment. His lawyer, wife and son did not respond to email requests seeking comment.\n\nAD\n\nHow a conservative Australian town rallied for family facing deportation\n\nIn 2015, Huang personally delivered 100,000 Australian dollars \u2014 worth about $70,000 and held together with rubber bands \u2014 to the Labor Party head office in the state of New South Wales.\n\nPolitical contributions by property developers are banned in the state. When a legal inquiry in Sydney last month revealed the donation, the party\u2019s top administrative official was forced to resign.\n\nHuang refused to give evidence in the inquiry, and a donation-disclosure filing asserted that the money came from 10 employees at a Sydney Chinese restaurant where he had dined with Shorten and other Labor politicians.\n\nAD\n\nWhen investigators ordered one of Huang\u2019s executives, Leo Liao, to answer questions in person about the money, he committed suicide. In a note to his wife and daughter, Liao said the summons triggered memories of his father being interrogated in China.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEventually he ended in jail,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was petrifying.\u201d\n\nAustralian officials are apparently collecting information about Huang\u2019s wider network in Australia.\n\nRoss Babbage, a former head of strategic analysis at the Office of National Assessments, an Australian intelligence agency, said that \u201cthere may be an interest in official circles in using such a prosecution to uncloak some of the realities\u201d of the Chinese Communist Party reach in Australia.\n\nAD\n\nReports submitted by tax officials to the court said that Huang had declared less than $35,000 in assets outside Australia and claimed earnings of about $1 million from 2012 to 2015. The tax office claims he generated about $120 million in income over the same period.\n\nHuang\u2019s lawyer has denied in court that his client owes the money.\n\nThe government canceled Huang\u2019s visa the day after he left for China in December 2018. Huang\u2019s wife, Jiefang, left Australia on Sept. 11, the day she and her husband were hit with the tax bill, according to government records.\n\nAD\n\nFive days later a federal court froze the Huangs\u2019 assets in Australia up to the value of $100 million, even though the judge, Anna Katzmann, said that it was unclear whether there was that much money left and that the debt couldn\u2019t be enforced in Hong Kong.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe amount of the tax liability is considerable and there is a real danger that, without the freezing orders, assets will be removed from Australia or otherwise dissipated,\u201d Katzmann wrote in the judgment.\n\nHuang has severed ties with his Australian business, Yuhu Group, which has extensive real estate assets and is run by his son, Jimmy. Yuhu officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nChina\u2019s influence on campus chills free speech in Australia, New Zealand\n\nThreat from China recalls that of Nazi Germany, Australian lawmaker says\n\nChina accuses Australian writer Yang Hengjun of espionage\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Developer Huang Xiangmo spent lavishly in Australia before fleeing.
