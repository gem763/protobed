He holds the league\u2019s all-time career scoring record, and he has been as automatic as you can get since 1996.\n\nBut he is struggling this year. Badly.\n\nHe missed two Indianapolis Colts extra points in Sunday\u2019s win over the Titans. That followed a Week 1 game in which he missed one extra point and two field goals of 46 and 29 yards. That\u2019s about as un-Vinatieri a performance as you can get.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAfter the game, Vinatieri had an ominous statement to assembled media:\n\nJust grabbed Adam Vinatieri was he headed to the bus. He said \u201cyou\u2019ll here from me tomorrow.\u201d I told him we don\u2019t see him tomorrow. And he said, \u201cYeah, you will.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Holder (@HolderStephen) September 15, 2019\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hear from me tomorrow,\u201d Vinatieri said. When reminded that Monday is usually an off day for the Colts, Vinatieri indicated that he would indeed be speaking to media Monday, regardless of the rest of the team.\n\nThe obvious extrapolation here is that Vinatieri will announce his retirement, and given that he\u2019s 46, that would come as no surprise. Here\u2019s how long he has been playing: his first season with the Patriots, the team lost to the Brett Favre-led Packers in the Super Bowl. At that point, the Patriots had won exactly zero Super Bowls. Steve Young, John Elway and Dan Marino were still playing. That\u2019s a long time ago.\n\nWe\u2019ll find out soon enough what Vinatieri has in mind. Regardless, he\u2019s one of the all-time greats, and if this is the end for him, he\u2019ll get all the praise he deserves while he waits for the call from Canton.\n\nColts kicker Adam Vinatieri reacts to hitting the right upright and missing a PAT during the fourth quarter against the Titans.
