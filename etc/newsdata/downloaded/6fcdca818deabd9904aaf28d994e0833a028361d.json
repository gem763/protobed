Gavin Newsom on Monday. Green addressed the topic during the Golden State Warriors\u2019 media day, likening college sports\u2019 governing body to a \u201cdictatorship.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone needs to force this dictatorship to change because that\u2019s exactly what it is,\u201d Green told reporters, according to the San Jose Mercury News. \u201cIt\u2019s no different than any country that\u2019s run by dictators. The NCAA is a dictatorship.\u201d\n\nGreen said the rule could affect the NCAA\u2019s ability to suspend players for getting compensation, and questions what organization President Mark Emmert will do.\n\nEmmert, who typically doesn't say much, will have to speak up now, Green said. \"I\u2019d love to see what his response is going to be to this, outside of \u2018Oh, well, you\u2019re going to be ineligible.\u2019\u201d\n\nFew players are worried about that now, he added.\n\nSherman, who has been a staunch advocate of payment for college athletes, said at a San Francisco 49ers practice that he hopes the bill \u201cdestroys the NCAA.\"\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s corrupt, and it\u2019s a bunch of people taking advantage of kids, and doing it under a mask of \u2018fair play,\u2019\u201d Sherman said. \u201cEven the things they\u2019re suspending these kids for are ridiculous. You\u2019re suspending kids for YouTube channels and they\u2019re saying, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s because other kids can\u2019t do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nCalifornia's action, he added, will \"cripple the NCAA in a way where they start to bend, make it more fair and more of a symbiotic relationship between players and the NCAA, or it's going to destroy them in general and start a whole new way of college athletics in general.\u201d\n\nThe law is set to take effect in 2023.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Champion pro athletes weigh in on California's \"Fair Pay to Play Act.\"", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/NCAA-Pay-stock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
