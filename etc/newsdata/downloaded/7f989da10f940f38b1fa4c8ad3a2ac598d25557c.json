It\u2019s very nice. I just don\u2019t see myself using it a lot, at least not on the Switch.\n\nThe Arctis 1 Wirelessly works spectacularly well with the Switch. SteelSeries\u2019 Arctis line has a lovely, mellow soundscape that\u2019s never too harsh or heavy on any end of the spectrum.\n\nThe SteelSeries Engine software lets users further customise their audio experience, fine-tuning equaliser settings and mic volume. They\u2019re light and comfortable. This particular model comes with a detachable ClearCast mic with noise cancelling that sounds quite nice in my noisy living room. It claims a 20-hour battery life, and so far it\u2019s held close to those claims. All-in-all, it\u2019s an excellent mid-range gaming headset.\n\nHandy on-ear controls are handy and on-ear.\n\nIt works well with the Switch. Plug in the dongle, hit power on the headset, and crisp, clear audio is piped into your ears. They sound great. The mic does a fine job of transmitting my voice in the handful of games that support direct voice chat and don\u2019t require Nintendo\u2019s mobile phone app. And when I want to play in handheld mode with a power cable attached, so I can charge and play at the same time, I am shit out of luck.\n\nWhen the battery on my Switch begins to die, the wireless headset must go bye-bye. There is no pass-through on the Arctis 1 Wireless\u2019 USB dongle, so it\u2019s either wireless sound or power. I can, however, plug a wired headset into the Switch in portable mode and never run into that problem. Seeing as I never play the Switch in portable mode from across a room, a short headset cable does not bother me.\n\nSteelSeries includes a number of cables with the Arctis 1 Wireless. For the Switch in docked mode there\u2019s a USB-A wire that terminates in a USB-C socket the dongle can be plugged into, so it\u2019s possible to use the headset in docked mode. There are a bunch of headsets out there that plug into USB-A for wireless, so the Arctis 1 isn\u2019t special in that regard. No, the main drawn for Switch owners is plugging that dongle into the bottom of the console. It\u2019s just not really that much of a draw in the long run.\n\nIt might not be perfect for the Switch, but the Arctis 1 Wireless is still a damn fine wireless gaming headset. I\u2019ve been using it on my laptop, its dongle fitting neatly into the USB-C socket. It\u2019s the same functionality as using the headset on the Switch, only now I can tweak with the SteelSeries Engine software whenever I please. With the included 3.5 mm cable I can plug the headset directly into my Xbox One or PlayStation 4 controller (the PS4 also sorts the USB-A dongle cable if the need arises).\n\nThe Arctis 1 Wireless is a pretty versatile gaming headset. I might not use the first truly wireless Switch headset for the Switch, but use it I certainly will.", "description": "Bundled with a first-of-its-kind USB-C 2.4GHz dongle that fits nicely in the bottom of the Switch, SteelSeries\u2019 $179 Arctis 1 Wireless gaming headset is the first truly wireless headset for Nintendo\u2019s latest console.
