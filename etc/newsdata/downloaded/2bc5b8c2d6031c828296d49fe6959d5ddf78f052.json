You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSo even for the top price, the rate per day (assuming you avoid February) is less than \u00a320. But where should you roam to maximise the opportunity?\n\nThe editors of Europe by Rail, Nicky Gardner and Susanne Kries, have prepared for readers of The Independent an optimal itinerary through the Alps and central Europe \u2013 spending the bulk of the time in countries where there\u2019s no need to pre-book trains and where Interrail passholders are not burdened with supplements.\n\n\u201dHead to Paris first,\u201c they urge. Interrail passengers can use Eurostar from London St Pancras for a payment of \u20ac30 (\u00a326).\n\nCross the French capital with the pass: Interrail is valid on the RER beneath Paris to Gare de Lyon. Locate the adjacent Gare de Bercy and travel on via Dijon and Beaune to the French Jura.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It sounds like a good place to pause for two or three nights, before taking to the rails again.\n\n\u201dOther than at the start of a trip, we rarely take trains two days in a row, other than perhaps for very short local trips,\u201c explains Gardner.\n\nFrom Lake Geneva, the duo suggest heading east through Liechtenstein; the principality does have a railway, stretching for six miles between Switzerland and Austria, and squeezing in four stations (but not the capital, Vaduz).\n\nThen join the mountainous Arlberg route through the Austrian Tyrol, making time for a two-night stop in Innsbruck.\n\nTravel on via Kitsb\u00fchel and Villach for a couple of days in Trieste, the gorgeous city at the head of the Adriatic where the Latin and Slavic worlds mingle. A dash of Habsburg flair adds something special to Trieste life.\n\nGardner and Kries then suggest taking the newly reinstated local train from Trieste to Ljubljana \u2013 a spectacular journey through barren limestone landscapes from Italy to the Slovenian capital \u2013 before making tracks north for Vienna \u2013 definitely worth a couple of nights.\n\nThen onto Prague, before catching the Alex train (run by a private German operator, but Interrail is accepted) through the hills of western Bohemia into Bavaria. Regensburg on the Danube is a good choice for an overnight stop.\n\n\u201dFrom there we\u2019d work our way west through Franconia to the Rhine Valley, which we would follow north (downstream) through the celebrated Rhine Gorge to Koblenz,\u201c says Gardner.\n\nThey recommend then following the Moselle Railway upstream beside the river to Trier and Luxembourg, for a last night on the continent.\n\n(People who want to travel completely free around an entire country should wait for next March, when Luxembourg abolishes all transport fares apart from first-class rail. Gardner and Kries will be on board on 1 March 2020.)\n\nFor the final full day of rail travel they suggest cutting through Belgium (\u201dthe Luxembourg to Li\u00e8ge railway is an unsung gem,\u201c says Kries) to reach the Dutch coast.\n\nFrom the Netherlands there is a choice of three overnight ferries to England: from Ijmuiden to Newcastle or Rotterdam to Hull and from Hook of Holland to Harwich; the Interrail pass confers a 30 per cent on the crossing to Essex.\n\nA dozen countries in 31 days may sound a bit of a dash, but the entire route can be accomplished in 17 travel days, with daily travel times ranging from four to seven hours.\n\nAll the routes mentioned are covered in the new 16th edition of 'Europe by Rail: The Definitive Guide\u200b\u2019 (\u00a316.99)", "description": "The concept of Interrail was launched in 1972: young people could buy, for \u00a332, a one-month pass that allowed unlimited travel on many of Europe\u2019s railways.
