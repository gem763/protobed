Flexibility. The other is tenacity. You stay persistent and never give up.\u201d\n\nGoodenough, who was in London when he received the news, said he, like Yoshino, didn\u2019t expect to be honoured, but expressed more pride in the worldwide impact of his work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely happy that my discovery has been able to help communication through the world. We need to build relationships, not wars. I am happy if people use this for good, not evil,\u201d he told reporters during a press conference.\n\nWhittingham, 77, said he was \u201covercome with gratitude at receiving this award\u201d. His research \u201chas helped advance how we store and use energy at a foundational level, and it is my hope that this recognition will help to shine a much-needed light on the (US) nation\u2019s energy future,\u201d he said on the website of Binghamton University in New York where he is a professor.\n\nYoshino, 71, works at the Asahi Kasei Corporation in Tokyo and is a professor at Meijo University in Nagoya, Japan, while Goodenough holds the Cockrell Chair in Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nThe trio will receive the prize from King Carl XVI Gustaf at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of scientist Alfred Nobel who created the prizes in his last will and testament.\n\nLast year, the honour went to US scientists Frances Arnold and George Smith and British researcher Gregory Winter for developing enzymes used for greener and safer chemistry and antibody drugs with fewer side effects.\n\nArnold was just the fifth woman to clinch chemistry\u2019s most prestigious honour since Marie Curie in 1911.\n\nThis year\u2019s Nobel season kicked off on Monday with the Medicine Prize, followed by the Physics Prize on Tuesday.\n\n\u2013 Peace Prize on Friday \u2013\n\nThe Literature Prize will follow on Thursday, with two laureates to be crowned after a sexual harassment scandal forced the Swedish Academy to postpone the 2018 award, for the first time in 70 years.\n\nNames creating a buzz ahead of this year\u2019s literature prize include Canadian poet Anne Carson, Kenyan writer Ngugi Wa Thiong\u2019o, Romanian poet and novelist Mircea Cartarescu and Polish writer and activist Olga Tokarczuk.\n\nOn Friday the action moves to Norway where the Peace Prize is awarded, with bookies predicting a win for Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nThe Economics Prize will wrap up the Nobel prize season on October 14.\n\nburs-po/rl", "description": "Stockholm (AFP) \u2013 Three researchers won the Nobel Chemistry Prize on Wednesday for the development of lithium-ion batteries, paving the way for", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/3f4ff9_trio-share-million-swedish-kronor-914-000-or-833-000-euros-prize-pioneers-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
