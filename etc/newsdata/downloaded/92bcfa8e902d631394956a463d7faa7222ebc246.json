Robert De Niro plays the real-life Mafia hitman Frank Sheeran, the film chronicling his decades-long involvement with labour union teamster Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) and crime boss Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci).\n\nThe $160 million drama, which marks Scorsese\u2019s fifth collaboration with De Niro and Pesci and his first with Pacino, clocks in at over three and a half hours long, and has sparked intrigue ever since it was revealed that the film\u2019s leading trio of actors were digitally \u201cde-aged\u201d for the film\u2019s extensive flashback sequences.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Rex Features\n\nBut the response to the film has otherwise largely been very positive. Here are just a selection of the reviews so far...\n\nStephanie Zacharek, Time\n\n\u201cFor the first two and a half hours of its three-and-a-half-hour runtime, The Irishman is clever and entertaining, to the point where you may think that\u2019s all it\u2019s going to be. But its last half-hour is deeply moving in a way that creeps up on you, and it\u2019s then that you see what Scorsese was working toward all along: A mini-history of late-20th century America as filtered through the eyes of a smalltime guy who needs and wants to believe in his own importance and capacity for decency\u2014and who can\u2019t see, though Scorsese can, that it\u2019s the end of a life that tells the truth about the middle.\u201d\n\nEric Kohn, IndieWire\n\n\u201cThe Irishman is Martin Scorsese\u2019s best crime movie since Goodfellas, and a pure, unbridled illustration of what has made his filmmaking voice so distinctive for nearly 50 years\u2026 the movie zips along at such a satisfying clip that its flaws rarely amount to more than mild speed bumps along the way.\u201d\n\nAO Scott, The New York Times\n\n\u201cThe Irishman finds its emotional centre in the vicissitudes of [the main trio\u2019s] friendship. This is Scorsese\u2019s least sentimental picture of mob life, and for that reason his most poignant\u2026 It\u2019s a gift for cinephiles, to be sure, but also a sombre acknowledgement of limitations.\u201d\n\nJesse Hassenger, The Verge\n\n\u201cThis is an Old Man movie \u2014 a slower late-period work by a filmmaker ruminating on his advancing age, and on the beloved classics he made as a younger guy. But it\u2019s Scorsese\u2019s version: pulsing with more life than most younger filmmakers, before giving way to stark, chilling regret.\u201d\n\nRichard Lawson, Vanity Fair\n\n\u201cScorsese, as ever, riskily courts sympathy for these thugs, and while there might be some notes of over-reverence in The Irishman, I think he mostly maintains the proper perspective. These are bad guys who\u2019ve done bad things, but in the movie\u2019s whispery allegory, all that misdeed is a harsh metaphor for the scrambling we do in our own lives. In The Irishman\u2019s arresting final act, Scorsese captures the smallness and loneliness of life, its pathetic flattening out\u2014time, in some senses but not all, eventually erodes away all of our context.\u201d\n\nThe Irishman will be released in selected UK cinemas on 8 November, before arriving on Netflix from 27 November.", "description": "The first reviews of Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman has seen the film dubbed a \u201csombre\u201d and \u201cemotional\u201d epic that is a \u201cgift for cinephiles\u201d.", "authors": ["Adam White"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/30/09/the-irishman-netflix.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
