Iran has reportedly attacked Saudi oil facilities. Both these events will generate more alarmist headlines, foretelling soaring oil prices or collapsing auto sales, and pointing to a looming recession. According to a recent tally, the word \u201crecession\u201d has occurred in more headlines over the past month than at any time since the financial crisis.\n\nDemocrats and their allies in the liberal media are so hoping for a downturn. The last thing they want to campaign against in 2020 is full employment and rising incomes. Consider last week\u2019s Democratic debate, during which 10 leading candidates avoided all mention of the economy. It was a formidable performance, ignoring for three hours what has always been, and will always be, the top concern for voters.\n\nIt was not an accident. The Democratic presidential candidates who gathered for the debate in Houston know that Americans are feeling upbeat about their own prospects and, despite the very best efforts of a compliant media, are optimistic about the future. Selling voters on policies that would torpedo the country\u2019s growth, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's proposal to overturn our capitalist system or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare-for-all\" or New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker\u2019s Green New Deal, is an uphill battle.\n\n2020 HOPEFUL JOHN DELANEY SLAMS TRUMP ON TRADE: 'EVERY ACRE OF GROUND IN IOWA IS WORTH LESS TODAY'\n\nWith unemployment low and jobs plentiful, incomes rising, and racial gaps narrowing, Democrats have a steep hill to climb even before they get to more contentious issues like abortion without limits or open borders.\n\nThe best Democrats can hope for is that the economy falls off a cliff between now and 2020. The liberal media has obligingly promoted dozens of reasons why this could happen at any moment. Interest rates are inverted! Interest rates are too low! Interest rates are too high! The Fed is not responsive; the Fed is too responsive! Trump\u2019s tariffs are killing consumers, the farmers, manufacturers, or somebody?\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nSurely, there is a recession looming somewhere.\n\nBut, as it happens, not yet. Consider last week\u2019s news. Retail sales in August rose 0.4 percent, double experts\u2019 forecasts. Likewise, the University of Michigan reported that consumer sentiment bounced higher, beating estimates. If you think that such reports frequently come in above forecasts, you\u2019re right. A spike up in Citi\u2019s Economic Surprise, which measures real reports against expectations, suggests that reports from the media and from Wall Street have consistently been overly pessimistic.\n\nConsider the alarm bells rung in recent weeks about the inversion of the yield curve, with short rates moving above those on longer-term bonds. Headlines blared that the shift guaranteed a recession was coming, if not already underway. But, as markets eventually realigned, and the flow of positive surprises continued, analysts came to conclude that this traditional precursor to a recession may no longer be reliable. The impact of the Federal Reserve and other central banks on interest rates is not only profound, it is also opaque. With a $4 trillion balance sheet, how the Fed buys and sells securities in its portfolio is unquestionably influential, and may have caused the rate inversion.\n\nNo matter. The harbingers of doom skipped seamlessly from inversion to the danger from rising mortgage rates, which increased along with a general recovery of long rates. \u201cMortgage rates had worst week in 3 years\u201d blared one headline on CNBC, adding \u201cit may be only the beginning.\u201d\n\nAfter breathlessly reporting that the rate on a 30-year mortgage had climbed 36 basis points (about a third of 1 percent) in the past couple of weeks, described as \u201cbad news for borrowers,\u201d the author had to concede that, \u201cThe good news is that rates are still incredibly low, and in the weeks before this turnaround, rates had fallen to the lowest level in three years.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Matthew Graham, chief operating officer of Mortgage News Daily is quoted saying, \u201cAugust was the best month for mortgage rates, and 2019 has been the best year since 2011. And that\u2019s precisely why this terrible week is possible: It\u2019s largely a technical correction to the feverish strength in August.\u201d\n\nForgetting the silly headlines, the author inadvertently raises yet another reason to be bullish. If the economy is a four-cylinder engine, we are currently running on only two \u2013 consumer (the largest) and government spending. Business investment has dropped, in response to uncertainty about the trade battle with China. Also, the large housing sector has been largely AWOL throughout this recovery. Before the financial crisis, real estate construction amounted to nearly 9 percent of GDP; last year it was barely above 6 percent.\n\nThere are a number of reasons for the surprising drought of new building, including an initial glut of inventory produced by the housing bubble. Young buyers face constraints such as high levels of student debt. At the same time, millennials have largely chosen to be city-dwellers; the high cost of rents has made it difficult for many to accumulate the funds needed to make a down payment on a home.\n\nMy theory is that, beyond those contributing factors, the country is less confident that home ownership is the first infallible step to wealth creation. Buying a home is attractive for many reasons, especially as rents climb in urban areas, but buyers are more cautious than they were before. They know that people can lose money on their homes, a sour aftertaste of the financial crisis.\n\nNevertheless, with mortgage rates extremely low, a shortage of houses on the market and with household formations growing, we will almost surely have a boom in home construction in the foreseeable future. Housing starts peaked in the last cycle at better than 2 million; last year they totaled 1.2 million. That number will likely increase, spurring further growth.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nConsumers are feeling positive about their prospects. A tight jobs market is driving wage gains and, in turn, consumer spending. It\u2019s a virtuous circle that benefits everyone.\n\nExcept for Democrats who want to take back the Oval Office.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY LIZ PEEK", "description": "Surely, there is a recession looming somewhere.", "authors": ["Liz Peek", "Liz Peek Is A Fox News Contributor", "Former Partner Of Major Bracket Wall Street Firm Wertheim", "Company.
