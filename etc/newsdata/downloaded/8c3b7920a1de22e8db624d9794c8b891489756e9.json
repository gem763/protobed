Focus takes a look at how the city is preparing for the sporting event, readying transport and venues which are set to leave a lasting legacy.\n\nThe Belarus capital Minsk is getting in gear for the second European Games. Four-thousand athletes, from across Europe will compete at the massive sports event which was first hosted by Azerbaijan in 2015.\n\nAnatol Kotau, the Deputy CEO of the Minsk European Games Organizing Committee (MEGOC), says Minsk is using well-established sports venues, long at the heart of the city.\n\n\u201cMinsk is some sort of unique situation...we didn\u2019t have to spend huge money for infrastructure, for sports venues and so on and so forth. We just had to renovate them and to make them be prepared to host sports in one city, at the same time.\u201d\n\nGoing for gold\n\n_\u201cThose competing at the Games here in Minsk will battle it out for medals across 15 different sports, ranging from rhythmic gymnastics to wrestling, and from beach soccer to basketball,\u201d says Euronews' Damon Embling.\n\n_\n\nRhythmic gymnast Ekaterina Galkina \u2013 from Minsk \u2013 will be among them. She\u2019s 22 and trains for up to nine hours a day.\n\n\u201cThe European Games for me is one of the main competitions this year...next year will be the Olympic Games and I see light at the end of the tunnel. And, of course, I want to do my best,\u201d she says.\n\nAlexander is also training hard for the European Games. Now 20, he first picked up a table tennis bat when he was six. The Games could provide him with Olympic qualification.\n\n\u201cThis is a very important, a very big competition, the European Games. It\u2019s only the second time, it's also very special because I didn\u2019t play in Baku, at the first European Games. And I try to do my best and I hope everything will be OK,\u201d he says.\n\nTransport infrastructure\n\nThe European Games will not only bring scores of athletes to Minsk, but also officials and spectators. To help get everyone around, the city\u2019s boosting its fleet of electric buses \u2013 all built in Belarus. They\u2019re yellow \u2013 but green.\n\n\u201cWhen people will come to the second European Games, they can easily find more than 80 modern electric buses, on the most popular routes. Visitors can easily get to any sports event and they will see how our buses are environmentally friendly, quiet and comfortable,\u201d explains Sergey Chistov, Deputy Chief Designer, Belkommunmash.\n\nVR games\n\nAs well as green technologies, Minsk is a city embracing all sorts of other innovations \u2013 like virtual reality and artificial intelligence. The IT start-up sector in the city is thriving and tech firm Synesis has designed a special app for the European Games\u2026 a one-stop shop for information.\n\n\u201cWhere the venues are, what programme of which sports are held there, even where you can buy tickets for the sports. All this kind of information is available in the app. Also, about places in Belarus, about Belarus itself, about Minsk. It\u2019s very interesting,\" says Alexander Gvozd from Synesis Sport.\n\nDevelopers here have also come up with a digital platform to help organisers manage the Games \u2013 providing all sorts of logistical information.\n\n\"We help to organise processes in accreditation, in accommodation, in arrivals and departures, transport, logistics, venue management,\u201d says Nailya Timerkhan, from Synesis Sport.\n\nLasting legacy\n\nBeyond the European Games, the buzz word is legacy with the event's organisers keen to ensure Minsk reaps long-term rewards.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have more than eight-thousand young volunteers, which will serve as a dynamic and energetic people during the Games and after the Games. We are also not spending money for the Games, we\u2019re investing them into the modernisation of the city infrastructure\u2026 to create a more green and friendly, for the citizens, city.\u201d says Anatol Kotau, from MEGOC.\n\nFor those competing in the Games, the countdown is now on. Gymnast Ekaterina is looking forward to a strong home crowd when she takes to the floor here at the Minsk Arena.\n\n\u201cOf course, a lot of my friends, my family will be there. I hope it will help me and a lot of people come to support me. And I think everything will be perfect,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Games run from the 21st to the 30th of June.", "description": "Focus looks at how Belarus capital Minsk is gearing up for the European Games, readying transport and venues which are set to leave a lasting legacy.", "authors": ["Damon Embling"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/77/56/48/1000x563_cmsv2_fb525966-52b4-5aab-9323-dc7fdd2d56cf-3775648.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-09"}
