It was still a more muted reception than expected, given the show\u2019s 14 remaining nominations heading into the night, spread across seven categories.\n\nBut HBO still ended the evening as the most decorated network, with nine total Emmys, thanks to three awards for limited series \u201cChernobyl,\u201d two awards for variety talk series \u201cLast Week Tonight with John Oliver,\u201d as well as nods for Bill Hader in \u201cBarry,\u201d and Jesse Armstrong\u2019s writing on \u201cSuccession.\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Netflix. After an impressive 23 wins at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards, Netflix took home only four trophies at the Primetime Emmys. Despite the critical acclaim for Ava DuVernay\u2019s limited series \u201cWhen They See Us,\u201d only lead actor Jharrel Jerome was recognized for his performance. Combined with a TV movie win for \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d for the third consecutive year, wins for \u201cOzark\u201d stars Julia Garner for supporting actress in a drama and Jason Bateman for directing rounded out the streaming service\u2019s underwhelming evening.\n\nSo what\u2019s it all mean? Why was \u201cVeep\u201d snubbed? What happened to the Television Academy\u2019s love affair with \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d? Will \u201cBarry\u201d or \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d be the comedy supreme in the future?\n\nAnd most importantly, where do we go from here?\n\nThere\u2019s a very simple answer: No one has any idea.\n\nWith the departure of Emmy favorites \u201cVeep\u201d and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d both the comedy and drama fields experience something of a vacuum, the likes of which we\u2019ve rarely seen. But that we\u2019ve seen before. Shows end all the time, even successful ones, even legendary ones. What\u2019s going to turn everything upside-down for the Emmys is the same thing that\u2019s going to turn all of television upside-down: the entrance of a new class of contenders.\n\nWith Apple TV+ and Disney+, there\u2019s a huge question looming over the industry that no one could possibly answer. Will \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d become the prestige drama fans can believe in? Will \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d be the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d replacement that dorks next declare undying devotion to? Is \u201cDickinson\u201d really having Wiz Khalifa play Death, and does that make him a perennial Emmy lock?\n\nOnly time \u2014 and maybe the Golden Globes \u2014 will tell.\n\nLaunch Gallery: 2019 Primetime Emmy Awards Highlights: The Best of TV's Big Night\n\nSign up for Indiewire's Newsletter.
