So do butts, it turns out.\n\nCreative folks over on Instagram have been slathering glitter all over their bits in order to create spooky looks.\n\nAnd the trend has just been resurrected ahead of this year\u2019s festivities.\n\nGlitter boobs did the rounds in 2018 with many a brave soul (it takes courage to leave the stuff on your body for weeks) eschewing clothes on the day and going bare.\n\nBut hey, at least they saved money on an outfit that\u2019s useless after 24 hours.\n\nPumpkin butts were all the rage last year, providing the perfect peach shape to paint the orange stuff on.\n\nAnd then people decided that the only thing better than one pumpkin is two and got out copius amounts of black and orange glitter to paint jack-o\u2019-lanterns onto their boobs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re inspired by these get-ups but don\u2019t want the same old pumpkin look then fret not, there are plenty of other options\n\nLeading the pack for the trend is Instagram page Go Get Glitter which pretty much does what it says on the tin.\n\nAnd this year they\u2019ve gone more scary than sexy, opting for some blood and gore.\n\nOne of the creations includes flesh, blood and\u2026mermaid scale? While that might not be the most frightening outfit, it certainly adds some edge to the mermaid look.\n\nAlso part of the latest designs is spider boobs, with two tarantulas \u2013 made out of beads \u2013 and plenty of baby spiders and cobwebs decorated all around the chest.\n\nSome people aren\u2019t just committing one body part to the costume but are painting their entire surface, with one woman painting a whole skeleton across her whole body.\n\nIf you don\u2019t fancy light refecting off residue glitter on your body for the rest of your life, you could always go for a tried and tested outfit \u2013 in which case Mean Girls costumes are there for you.\n\nIn the meantime, enjoy some more Halloween-inspired boobs.\n\nMORE: An American Horror Story themed Halloween party is coming to London\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: These mini haunted houses are the perfect Halloween treat for cats who love being spooky\n\nMORE: Best Mean Girls Halloween costumes and where to get them\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Creative folks over on Instagram have been slathering glitter all over their bits in order to create spooky looks for Halloween.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_88658014_1570429089.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
