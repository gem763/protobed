It will even allow you to pick a preferred provider and to opt for different ride options, including pool or economy.\n\nIf you prefer to cycle, there are also routes tailored specifically for cyclists. The app might, for example, recommend you get to a bus stop by bike to save time on a journey, or to take an Uber or Bolt at the end of a trip.\n\nGoogle Maps also recently introduced a \"Live View\" feature.
