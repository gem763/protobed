He'd been part of the social network for 14 years and realized that aside from eating and sleeping, scrolling Facebook had become his most consistent daily activity.\n\nHe concluded that some of his Facebook friendships were superficial, nothing more than filtered snapshots of people's best moments, and required little energy beyond scrolling and \"liking.\"\n\n\"We think if we look at someone [on Facebook], and we clock where they are in the world, then we've checked in,\" Avramenko said. \"And it's not. It's a one-way street. That's not a relationship. It's voyeurism.\"\n\nI'm not telling somebody to drop dead, I'm just getting them off of my Facebook - James Avramenko\n\nRather than post a long, dramatic farewell and abruptly abandon the network, he decided to phone up each friend for a one-hour conversation in which they reflect on their past, their present, and their future as friends \u2014 if they have one.\n\nHe turned it into a podcast called Friendless.\n\nBlast from the past\n\nIn July, Avramenko sent a message to Juno award winning fiddler Ben Plotnick. The pair, who went to elementary school in Calgary, hadn't spoken in nearly 20 years. Their phone conversation makes up an episode of the podcast.\n\nWhen they finally spoke, Avramenko said to Plotnick, \"We've been friends for 10 years on Facebook and the first time we've messaged was last week.\"\n\nThey laughed and apologized for not keeping in touch.\n\n\"I'm quite embarrassed about how little I know about the trajectory of your life,\" Plotnick said.\n\nJames Avramenko likes to joke that his podcast 'Friendless' is about losing friends, but says that, in a way, it's actually about finding them. (James Avramenko)\n\nThe childhood friends reminisced about how scared they were to get their measles vaccinations and reflected on schoolyard bullying, white privilege, and career milestones.\n\nWhen Avramenko declared their Facebook friendship over, the two quipped that they still have Instagram.\n\nTech users rethink their choices\n\nAlec Couros, a University of Regina professor who teaches about information and communication technologies, said people are trying to be more deliberate in how they use social media platforms.\n\nThat can include restricting public posts, casting Twitter or Facebook aside, or putting limits on how much time one spends online.\n\nCouros said it's a trend that fights against technology that's designed to be addictive and societal pressure to \"be connected\" online.\n\n\"We need to go back to a point where we are investing in relationships,\" he said. \"Otherwise, we may be well-connected, but we're still going to be very lonely.\"\n\nCouros points to research by British anthropologist Robin Dunbar that suggested humans can only ever maintain up to 150 meaningful relationships at a time, either online or in real life.\n\nDunbar's most recent study zeros in on Facebook relationships and concludes the average Facebook user has just 14 \"close\" friends amongst all their connections on the social network \u2014 and only four they can actually depend on in times of crisis.\n\nFriendships die a natural death\n\nAvramenko isn't sure how vigilant he'll be in connecting with his newly \"unfriended friends\" in person or by phone going forward.\n\nHe said that if some of the relationships flounder and die, that's just the natural conclusion of friendships that have been unnaturally kept alive in the digital age.\n\n\"I'm not telling somebody to drop dead, I'm just getting them off of my Facebook,\" Avramenko joked.\n\nHe says he believes friendship can be \"fluid\" with an expiry date.\n\n\"I think what Facebook has done is, it's erased our ability to edit our lives because now everything feels permanent. And so, when we make a friendship, we feel we have to maintain that friendship by maintaining this [online] connection.\"\n\nAvramenko purges some people from his Facebook friend list without a personal phone call if he can't remember the person, or can't imagine what they would talk about.\n\nBut, at least once a week, he plans to have a one hour conversation with a friend before his digital dump.\n\nAt this rate, he should be friendless in 10 years.\n\nOn Facebook, anyway.", "description": "Saskatoon writer James Avramenko calls a Facebook friend every week to personally reconnect, then ends their online relationship.
