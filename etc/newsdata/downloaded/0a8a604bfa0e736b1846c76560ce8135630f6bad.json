Ted Cruz (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nOn Sunday night, after a phone call between President Trump and Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the White House announced that the small number of U.S. forces in northern Syria would be withdrawn ahead of a Turkish invasion of the area, which is currently controlled by America\u2019s Kurdish allies. The White House press secretary also said that \u201cTurkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLess than two weeks ago, at a September 26 press conference, Trump said that America would \u201cnot forget\u201d our Kurdish allies who had died fighting ISIS. \u201cTens of thousands of Kurds died fighting ISIS. They died for us and with us and for themselves,\u201d President Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re great people and we have not forgotten.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cKurds are great people, great fighters, I like them a lot. We are trying to help them a lot. Don\u2019t forget that\u2019s their territory.They fought with us, they died with us, we lost tens of thousands of Kurds fighting ISIS. They\u2019re great people and we have not forgotten.\u201d pic.twitter.com/jNcP0a30Ot \u2014 Mutlu Civiroglu (@mutludc) September 27, 2018\n\nMany congressional Republicans condemned President Trump\u2019s decision as a betrayal of our Kurdish allies that could allow ISIS to come roaring back.\n\n\u201cIt would also be DISGRACEFUL if we sat idly by while Turkey slaughters the Kurds, as public reports suggest that Turkish leader Erdogan explicitly told President Trump he intends to do. Kurds risked their lives\u2014for many years\u2014to fight alongside us,\u201d Texas Republican senator Ted Cruz wrote on Twitter. \u201cOur enemies and rivals (Iran, Russia, etc.) don\u2019t abandon their allies; if we want allies to stand with America in the future, we shouldn\u2019t either. Honorable nations stand by their friends.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t see Donald Trump\u2019s name on the tweet, I thought it would be Obama\u2019s rationale for getting out of Iraq,\u201d South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham said on Fox & Friends on Monday morning. \u201cThe biggest lie being told by the administration is ISIS is defeated\u2026. This is going to lead to ISIS\u2019 reemergence. Nothing better for ISIS than to create a conflict between the Kurds and Turkey.\u201d\n\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell issued the following statement:\n\n\u201cIn January, a supermajority of the U.S. Senate voted for an amendment that expressed bipartisan concern about the continuing threat posed by ISIS and Al Qaeda in Syria, appreciation of the long-term American security interests in Syria and the region, and support for a continued military presence in northeastern Syria. \u201cThe conditions that produced that bipartisan vote still exist today. While the physical caliphate has been removed, ISIS and al Qaeda remain dangerous forces in Syria and the ongoing Syrian civil war poses significant security and humanitarian risks. \u201cA precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime. And it would increase the risk that ISIS and other terrorist groups regroup. \u201cI urge the President to exercise American leadership to keep together our multinational coalition to defeat ISIS and prevent significant conflict between our NATO ally Turkey and our local Syrian counterterrorism partners. Major new conflict between Turkey and our partners in Syria would seriously risk damaging Turkey\u2019s ties to the United States and causing greater isolation for Turkey on the world stage. \u201cAs we learned the hard way during the Obama Administration, American interests are best served by American leadership, not by retreat or withdrawal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the President sticks with this retreat, he needs to know that this bad decision will likely result in the slaughter of allies who fought with us, including women and children. I hope the President will listen to his generals and reconsider,\u201d Nebraska senator Ben Sasse said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Kurds have been a critical and reliable partner to the US, and have played an integral role in the fight against ISIS. We cannot abandon them now,\u201d Iowa senator Joni Ernst wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster,\u201d Utah senator Mitt Romney wrote on Twitter.\n\nWhile most congressional Republicans who spoke out on Monday opposed President Trump\u2019s new policy in Syria, the policy was supported by Kentucky senator Rand Paul and Utah senator Mike Lee. \u201cI stand with @realDonaldTrump today as he once again fulfills his promises to stop our endless wars and have a true America First foreign policy,\u201d Paul wrote on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCongress has never declared war or authorized the use of military force in Syria. While I remain concerned with Turkey\u2019s behavior and the threat they pose to the Kurds, I support President Trump\u2019s decision to draw down U.S. armed forces from Syria,\u201d Lee said in a statement. \u201cOur founding fathers established a system of separated powers between three branches and gave Congress the power to declare war. Returning to this constitutional system and restoring Congress\u2019s Article One powers would mitigate much of this confusion. Members of Congress have already begun discussing steps the U.S. can take to support the Kurds and deter Turkey. I look forward to engaging in those conversations.\u201d", "description": "Many congressional Republicans condemned President Trump\u2019s decision as a betrayal of our Kurdish allies that could allow ISIS to come roaring back.", "authors": ["John Mccormack", "Andrew C.
