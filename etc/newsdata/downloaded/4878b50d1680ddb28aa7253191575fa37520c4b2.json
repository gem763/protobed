It directed each of the NCAA's three divisions to update their bylaws no later than January 2021.\n\n\"The board's action today creates a path to enhance opportunities for student-athletes while ensuring they compete against students and not professionals,\" NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a statement on the website ncaa.org.\n\nThe Indianapolis-based NCAA reported total revenues of more than $1bn last year, about 80 percent of which came from television and marketing rights fees.\n\nCalifornia last month became the first US state to give college athletes the potentially lucrative opportunity to earn endorsement money, with Governor Gavin Newsom signing legislation into law that would take effect in 2023. Sponsors said the law could encourage star players to stay in school rather than dropping out to turn professional.\n\nThe state of New Jersey quickly moved to follow suit, with lawmakers last week introducing the \"New Jersey Fair Play Act\" to allow student-athletes compensation for the use of their names or likenesses and to also give them the ability to hire their own agents or lawyers.\n\nSimilar bills are under consideration in the states of Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Minnesota - and in the US Congress - according to media reports.\n\nThe NCAA said \"modernization\" of its guidelines should \"reaffirm that student-athletes are students first and not employees of the university\".\n\nThe NCAA board voted to allow student-athletes to endorse brands after hearing recommendations from a working group that gathered input from student-athletes, coaches, college presidents, faculty and commissioners from its three divisions, the NCAA said.", "description": "The change will likely benefit US athletes in high-profile sports such as basketball and American football.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/29/1a6b298ace354ffeb2551c423010a863_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
