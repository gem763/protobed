Kerry, who associates say has wondered aloud about whether he should have run and has found it hard to watch Mr. Biden\u2019s missteps, has also been urged to get in. But he still thinks the former vice president , who was once his longtime Senate colleague, is the party\u2019s best nominee.\n\nAnother Obama administration official who weighed a campaign at the start of the year, former Attorney General Eric Holder, is considering a last-minute entry but has conceded it may be too late, according to a Democrat familiar with his thinking.\n\nMr. Brown, who nearly entered the race earlier this year, said the pressure on him to reconsider from labor leaders, Democratic officials and donors has \u201cbecome more frequent.\u201d And Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor, who also weighed a campaign run before deciding not to, said he too has been nudged by friends to reconsider. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be rumored about,\u201d he said, before notably refusing to rule out a last-minute entry. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me that question,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Mr. Patrick suggested an 11th-hour bid was highly unlikely and had a message for increasingly angst-ridden Democrats: \u201cEverybody needs to calm down, it\u2019s early. It\u2019s so early.\u201d\n\nThe chances that another major contender decides to run are remote: While Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Bloomberg have both been encouraged to enter the race, Democrats close to them believe the only scenario under which they\u2019d consider running is if Mr. Biden drops out or is badly weakened.", "description": "Party leaders who are fatalistic about Democrats\u2019 chances in 2020 are musing about possible late entrants to the race.
