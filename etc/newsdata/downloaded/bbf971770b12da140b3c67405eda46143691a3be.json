Confidence could be eroded by continued deterioration of these and other variables.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump is heading into reelection with a deep manufacturing recession\n\nThe bad news has been piling up lately: U.S. manufacturing has fallen to its lowest level in more than a decade, while the services sector is at its weakest level in three years, according to data released by the Institute for Supply Management this week. Markets retreated Tuesday and Wednesday in a two-day plunge that wiped out more than 3 percent of the stock market. Job growth is slowing, and auto sales are contracting after seven years of brisk growth.\n\nAnd although the unemployment rate remains low \u2014 at 3.7 percent \u2014 economists say it could begin to inch up if companies cut back on hiring. The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits rose during the last week in September, according to Labor Department figures released Thursday. Monthly jobs data for September is scheduled to be released Friday morning.\n\n\u201cInvestors will be looking for further evidence of economic weakness in the labor market, which makes [Friday\u2019s jobs] report that much more important,\" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management. \"There are signs that trade-related tensions may have a broader impact on the overall economy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven so, many consumers continue to feel good about their personal finances, according to the National Retail Federation\u2019s chief economist.\n\nThe question now, he said, is whether political uncertainty will offset their \u201cwillingness and ability to spend this holiday season.\u201d Nearly 80 percent of consumers surveyed by the group said they were concerned that tariffs could lead to price increases and affect their shopping plans.\n\nAmerican consumers are holding up the global economy. But for how long?\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s months-long trade war with China continues to loom over the holiday season. Although consumers have been largely shielded from earlier rounds of tariffs, retailers say they may soon have little choice but to pass on cost increases on clothing, shoes, toys and electronics. More than $110 billion worth of Chinese goods were hit with a 15 percent tariff Sept. 1. An additional $160 billion in imports, including laptops, cellphones and video game consoles, will be taxed beginning in mid-December.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThose new tariffs are expected to raise the price of toys by 17 percent, shoes by 8 percent, clothing by 5 percent, and furniture and televisions by 4 percent, according to a report by Trade Partnership Worldwide, prepared for the National Retail Federation.\n\n\u201cNone of these retailers want to pass on any cost to consumers if they can avoid it,\u201d Shay said on a call with reporters Thursday. \u201cAll are hoping that we\u2019re going to find a constructive way to address these issues and resolve our trade disputes.\u201d\n\nRetailers struggled during boom times. What happens if there\u2019s a recession?\n\nOverall, the trade group expects holiday retail sales to increase between 3.8 percent and 4.2 percent from last year, to about $730 billion. Online sales are expected to increase as much as 14 percent, to $167 billion, according to the NRF.\n\nAD\n\nHoliday spending grew 2.1 percent last year, markedly lower than the NRF\u2019s original forecast of about 4.5 percent. The group attributed that \u201cunusually small\u201d showing to the government shutdown, stock market volatility and tariffs.\n\n\u201cThere are probably very few precedents for this uncertain macroeconomic environment,\u201d said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist for the NRF. \u201cThere is significant economic unease.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Consumers have so far been a bright spot in an otherwise flagging economy, and economists say this holiday season will be another test of their resilience.", "authors": ["Abha Bhattarai", "Reporter Covering The Retail Industry"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Hu4fUJvkm3HZ25sgLiuaueNc3Rw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MHMZZ5XF44I6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
