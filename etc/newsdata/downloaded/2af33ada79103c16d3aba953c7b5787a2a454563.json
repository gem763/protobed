The driver was on the wrong side of the road, which she admitted to police the next day while assuring them that she would not leave the country. After the boy\u2019s funeral, she fled to the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt turns out that the driver was the wife of a U.S. diplomat working at a Royal Air Force base in Northamptonshire. Though her husband\u2019s exact role has not been confirmed, media reports and the base\u2019s use as a U.S. listening station suggest that he might work in intelligence.\n\nSince 19-year-old Harry Dunn\u2019s death, Northamptonshire police have attempted to conduct an investigation into the incident with the American suspect\u2019s assistance. These efforts have been fruitless, as the U.S. government has afforded her diplomatic immunity and shielded her from possible prosecution.\n\nDominic Raab, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, telephoned the U.S. ambassador to the U.K., Woody Johnson, to express disappointment and \u201curge the Embassy to reconsider.\u201d Raab has spoken to his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to reiterate his disappointment, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that the suspect should lose immunity. But the U.S. embassy has stayed firm and refused to grant a waiver of immunity.\n\nThis story is not going away, nor is the pain felt by Harry\u2019s family. It appears likely that this tension will continue for some time, as the U.S. embassy has confirmed that the family left the U.K. on the advice of senior State Department officials, adding that it is uncommon for immunity to be waived in these circumstances. It seems that the British Foreign Office agreed, as it did not publicly object to the suspect\u2019s return to the U.S. at the time. But the British people do not agree: They are furious, and rightly so. As America\u2019s closest ally and the first nation to provide assistance when it is desired, Britain and its people deserve better than this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe wives of diplomats do not need to be protected from British justice. This is a fair and evenhanded country ruled by equitable laws and without cruel or unusual punishment. If it were a tyrannical, authoritarian regime with an inhumane criminal-justice system, then the U.S. government\u2019s actions would have some merit and justification. Last year, for example, an American diplomat killed a 22-year-old Pakistani after running a red light and was granted immunity and returned to the U.S. The recovery was fair. Put politely, Pakistan has a dubious justice record and access to a free trial is not guaranteed.\n\nBut, regardless of what some ethno-nationalists would have you believe, Britain is not Pakistan. Indeed, our sentencing guidelines for manslaughter via dangerous driving are lighter than those found in many U.S. states. And without the defense of an unfair trial to support its decision, the U.S. government\u2019s move to whisk her away and save her from justice says to many that it thinks its people can get away with killing British citizens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are some 23,000 people living in Britain with diplomatic immunity. It allows them to ignore the law-abiding principles and the taxes expected of other residents. For the most part, this is tolerated, as the immunity rarely extends beyond parking fines or congestion charges. It is not accepted when used to cover a killing carried out by a diplomat\u2019s family member.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the U.S. government has a strong reason for protecting the suspect in this way, it should announce it soon, as public discontent is only going to grow. A kind, good young man was killed, leaving his mother and family \u201cin complete ruin.\u201d Thanks to the elite nature of his suspected killer\u2019s role, she has gotten away with it. This is intolerable.\n\nAmericans who respect the rule of law and Britain\u2019s longstanding special friendship with the United States should campaign for justice to be served.", "description": "An American accused of killing an English boy through reckless driving should not be allowed to escape justice simply because she is a diplomat's wife.", "authors": ["Charlie Peters", "Andrew C.
