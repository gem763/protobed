Photo: Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s been a weird week or so for the presidential campaign of U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D\u2013Hawaii). She announced and then abandoned plans to boycott the Democratic-candidate debate in Ohio after denouncing it as the product of a DNC/\u201ccorporate media\u201d plot to rig the nominating contest. At the debate itself, she didn\u2019t get much attention other than some raised eyebrows for saying this (according to the Washington Post\u2019s transcript):\n\nI agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others, but when she said abortion should be safe, legal, and rare, I think she\u2019s correct.\n\nActually, although Clinton did use that language (famously deployed by her husband in 1992) in her 2008 campaign, she\u2019d abandoned it by 2016 in response to a growing concern from reproductive-rights advocates that the \u201crare\u201d part demonized women who wanted to have abortions, which were, after all, mostly legal. I don\u2019t know whether this comment annoyed HRC, but in any event, she sure as hell unloaded on Gabbard a couple of days later, as Axios noted:\n\nHillary Clinton said on David Plouffe\u2019s podcast, Campaign HQ, this week that Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D\u2013Hawaii) is Russia\u2019s \u201cfavorite\u201d 2020 candidate and said the country could be \u201cgrooming\u201d her to become a third-party candidate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions, but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She\u2019s the favorite of the Russians \u2026\u201d\n\nClinton didn\u2019t finger Gabbard by name, but the odds are very high that she was talking about her. Gabbard certainly took it that way and fired back with a tweetstorm of near-Trumpian grandiosity:\n\nGreat! Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain. From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a ... \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\n... concerted campaign to destroy my reputation. We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know \u2014 it was always you, through your proxies and ... \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\n... powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly. \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\nSorry, Elizabeth Warren. Sorry, Joe Biden. Sorry, Bernie Sanders. Sorry, Mayor Pete and Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar and all the others: This primary is between me and you.\n\nWhile it would most definitely enliven the Democratic race if Clinton leaped in, I would bet the farm I don\u2019t have that, even in that incredibly unlikely event, the race would not wind up being a Clinton-Gabbard throwdown. Perhaps the Hawaiian will get some fresh lefty street cred for saying nasty things about HRC out loud that others have simply thought, though even Hillary haters don\u2019t typically think of her as the \u201cqueen of warmongers.\u201d But this is more likely just a bizarre incident in which one pol tossed off a random remark in a podcast and another happily rose to the bait, happy for the attention.\n\nBesides, everybody knows the queen of warmongers is Cersei Lannister, not Hillary Rodham Clinton!", "description": "First, Tulsi Gabbard misstates HRC\u2019s position on abortion, then Clinton suggests Gabbard is Russia\u2019s \u201cfavorite,\u201d then Gabbard calls her the \u201cqueen of warmongers\u201d and challenges her to a political duel.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/18/18-gabbard-clinton.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
