The murderer who can\u2019t stop himself revisiting the scene of the crime. The subconscious nearly always betrays you. Midway through an afternoon on which he had avoided facing 45 minutes of prime minister\u2019s questions and a further two hours of interrogation at the liaison committee by proroguing parliament, Boris Johnson decided he would subject himself to a gruelling 14 minutes of cross-examination in \u201cpeople\u2019s PMQs\u201d on Facebook Live.\n\nThis was to be guilt expressed as hollow narcissism. Tinged with utter contempt. The only consolation is he must hate himself almost as much as he hates us. The 30-second trailer featured Johnson looking busy and promising to \u201cwork flat out to give the country the leadership it deserves\u201d. He really should stop talking Britain down. I know we\u2019ve all made some stupid decisions over the past few years, but surely we haven\u2019t sunk this low? This was politics that took the entire UK for mugs. A simple trolling exercise to which even The Jeremy Kyle Show wouldn\u2019t have stooped.\n\nCorbyn goes mainstream just as extremism comes back into fashion | John Crace Read more\n\nFrom a set that looked much like the scene of Nicolae Ceausescu\u2019s last broadcast before his execution \u2013 a wobbly union jack and a toy bus, behind a makeshift desk, the feed went live and a grinning face flickered into view. Smirky McSmirkface. More quiz show host than prime minister.\n\n\u201cI worry that people feel disconnected from politics,\u201d he began. Which is why he had felt obliged to mislead the queen, prorogue parliament, sack 21 moderate MPs and threaten to ignore the law of the country. Grand larceny in the name of democracy. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got some pretty tough questions here.\u201d Probably from girly swots. Though luckily he had been able to weed all of those ones out, so the only questions he had to answer were those that had been hand-picked so that even a complete idiot couldn\u2019t screw up.\n\nThe first question was from Rosie. Could he guarantee that everyone would have somewhere to live? Absolutely. He would do everything in his power to make sure he didn\u2019t become homeless. Would the NHS get extra money? Of course. He was building 12 hospitals single-handedly and was on the verge of a medical breakthrough that would cure all cancers.\n\nBoris prodded a pudgy finger absent-mindedly at an iPad. A question from Emma popped up. Why was he behaving in such an anti-democratic manner? \u201cPifflepafflewifflewaffle,\u201d he said. Nothing could be further from the truth, it was MPs who were being undemocratic by insisting on parliamentary democracy. He was just this honest guy who had wanted to take five weeks off to work on a Queen\u2019s speech in which he could promise whatever he liked because there would be an election long before anyone realised he couldn\u2019t deliver it.\n\nA follow-up question from Elizabeth in Balmoral, demanding to know why he had deliberately lied to her and dragged her into a constitutional crisis was hastily deleted by an unseen hand that unplugged the power cable to the internet router. Um, let\u2019s move on to something a bit easier, Johnson burbled. When would we be leaving the EU? \u201cOn 31 October,\u201d he said. Though he couldn\u2019t say how. Or whether the Northern Ireland backstop would or would not be removed. Definitely. Maybe.\u2026\n\nAndrea L from Westminster wanted to know if it was right to try to conceal the details of Operation Yellowhammer. \u201cVery good question, Andrea,\u201d Boris mumbled. He couldn\u2019t agree more. It was far better for people not to worry themselves about the fact that some of them would almost certainly die. They might even get run over and killed on their way home tonight. Or hit by an asteroid. With any luck. Then he wouldn\u2019t have to choose which bits of the plan not to reveal.\n\nThe questions came thick and fast. Dom C was in C&A and couldn\u2019t make up his mind whether to buy the green or blue puffa gilet. Green, definitely. It would go down a storm when they all got to meet some really poor people on their trips north. Carrie S wondered if he could buy some more dog food. Sajid J begged to be released from house arrest so he could announce the opening of a new duty free shop at Scratchwood Services. Kwasi K wanted all judges killed. Bit extreme, but he had a point.\n\n\u201cGosh,\u201d said Johnson. Was that the time? He had to bring the people\u2019s PMQs to a close. He\u2019d have loved to carry on but he was all wrung out. He\u2019d given so much of himself. No Clown Prince could have done more. He had the country exactly where he wanted it. A laughing stock.
