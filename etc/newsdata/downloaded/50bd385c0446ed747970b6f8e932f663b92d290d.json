Ilhan Omar wants Trump suspended from Twitter", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Ilhan Omar pressed Twitter to suspend President Trump after his account shared a tweet Wednesday that falsely claimed to show her partying during last week\u2019s anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nOriginally posted by conservative commentator Terrence Williams and subsequently shared by Mr. Trump, the tweet contained a video of Ms. Omar, Minnesota Democrat, dancing Friday at an event hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. Williams falsely claimed that the clip was filmed days earlier on the anniversary of Sept. 11, and Mr. Trump shared that tweet, adding that it depicted the \u201cnew face of the Democrat Party.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President of the United States is continuing to spread lies that put my life at risk,\u201d Ms. Omar reacted on Twitter. \u201cWhat is Twitter doing to combat this misinformation?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have a responsibility and they set community standards and clearly the president has shown many-a-times that he has violated their community standards,\u201d she later told Politico. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why his account is not fully suspended \u2014 why he\u2019s not deplatformed.\u201d\n\nThe original tweet posted by Mr. Williams was taken off Twitter later Wednesday, though the president\u2019s post amplifying the since-removed video remains online and has been retweeted more than 14,000 times within roughly a day of being posted by the president.\n\nA spokesperson for Twitter confirmed that Mr. Williams had deleted the erroneous tweet, Politico reported. The company did not comment on the president\u2019s post, the report said.\n\nMr. Trump has regularly taken aim at Ms. Omar, a former Somali refugee and naturalized U.S. citizen who is among a handful of fellow first-term progressive congresswomen of color colloquially known as \u201cThe Squad.\u201d He has repeatedly shared edited footage of the congresswoman that takes her past comments about 9/11 out of context, and he infamously said two months ago that Ms. Omar and fellow Squad members should \u201cgo back\u201d to the \u201ccorrupt\u201d countries where they are from.\n\nMs. Omar, a member of the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee, previously said that she has received death threats amid coming under fire from Mr. Trump.\n\nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
