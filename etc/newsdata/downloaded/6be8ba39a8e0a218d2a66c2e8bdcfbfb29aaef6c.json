Photo: David Hindley/Path\u00e9 Productions\n\nSaying that Ren\u00e9e Zellweger will definitely get an Oscar nomination for playing Judy Garland in Judy is not the same thing as saying Ren\u00e9e Zellweger is good as Judy Garland in Judy. A scale of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d doesn\u2019t really feel like the most accurate way to assess what the actress does in director Rupert Goold\u2019s biopic. It\u2019s a big, committed performance, one that veers between acting and impersonation, and between attempts to capture the real Garland and the outsize image of her. There are times in which Zellweger\u2019s absolutely electric \u2014 like the scene in which Judy is hustled, disoriented and anxious, on to an opening night stage in London where she\u2019s slated to perform for the next month or so. Disaster seems imminent, unavoidable even, but instead she pulls herself together out there in the bright lights, and belts out a bravura version of \u201cBy Myself\u201d that the movie captures in a long, agile take. Garland was one of the great entertainers of Hollywood, and Zellweger can\u2019t replicate her singing, but what she does is lovely and just as impressive \u2014 she evokes the spirit of a Garland performance, all rich voice and richer emotion.\n\nElsewhere, though, Zellweger\u2019s Judy can feel like a butterfly we\u2019re watching get pinned for display while it\u2019s still alive and desperately wriggling. Judy, which was adapted by screenwriter Tom Edge from Peter Quilter\u2019s Tony-winning musical End of the Rainbow, takes place at a time when, broke and in increasingly poor health, Garland booked a five-week run of shows at the Talk of the Town that one critic at the time described by saying \u201cShe doesn\u2019t really give a concert \u2014 she conducts a s\u00e9ance.\u201d Garland was an alcoholic and a drug addict whose reputation for being erratic and difficult had made it impossible for her to secure the kind of work that had once made her a star. She\u2019d weathered multiple suicide attempts and four divorces \u2014 her fifth marriage unfolds in a compressed form over the course of the film, with a smarmy Finn Wittrock playing her final husband, Mickey Deans. Judy is invested in Garland\u2019s talent, but the movie is really enraptured by her tragedy \u2014 the alcoholism and the breakdowns, the terrible taste in men and the bursts of self-loathing all put on display over a condensed stretch of time.\n\nThat particular conception of Garland gets underscored by a set of dire flashbacks to her early years as a teen star under the notoriously oppressive control of MGM\u2019s Louis B. Mayer (Richard Cordery), in which she\u2019s played by Darci Shaw. The film presents these sequences with the kind of leaden import usually seen in a Batman movie portraying the death of Bruce Wayne\u2019s parents. Mayer informs the young Judy that she\u2019s a \u201cfat-ankled gap-toothed rube\u201d \u2014 cut to 1968 Judy as a disaster of self-doubt. Studio handlers force pills down her throat, and as an adult she pops them with the open-palmed theatricality that you really only see in movies. The mistreatment Garland experienced as a young actor is a justifiably well-known part of her biography, an infamous example of how toxic the business could be to performers who had to present a smiling face to the public. But to treat it like an origin story the way Judy does, a key that so neatly unlocks all the components of her, ends up flattening Garland in ways that don\u2019t do her justice. She was an immensely complicated figure, but in Judy, she\u2019s a martyr.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that the best parts of the movie are the ones that make space for flickers of discomfort. There\u2019s the aforementioned scene in which Judy is essentially shoved onto the stage by her long-suffering handler Rosalyn (Jessie Buckley, so excellent in Wild Rose), a process that\u2019s repeated later with a lot less success. There are the times when Judy lashes out when her husbands, ex- and current, dare imply that her own behavior has had some bearing on the state of her career, and she stops being an object of pity and becomes one of exhilarating frustration. And there\u2019s the thread about how terrible she feels leaving her younger children, Lorna (Bella Ramsey, Lyanna Mormont herself) and Joey (Lewin Lloyd) in L.A., and about how that might actually be the best place for them to stay. Zellweger clearly did her homework for Judy, studying up on Garland\u2019s mannerisms and posture, and at one point offering up a laugh that makes her look eerily like the woman she\u2019s playing. But it\u2019s hard not to gather up these move complicated moments and wish for more of them \u2014 to think about how much better it would have been if she had gotten to play Garland as a flesh-and-blood person and not as the saint of suffering for showbiz.", "description": "An Oscar-ready Ren\u00e9e Zellweger plays Judy Garland and sings \u201cSomewhere Over The Rainbow\u201d in this biopic set later in the troubled icon\u2019s life, adapted from Peter Quilter\u2019s musical \u201cEnd of the Rainbow\u201d by Tom Edge and directed by Rupert Goold.", "authors": ["Alison Willmore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/27/27-judy.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
