This puts it in the \u201centry-level\u201d category of robot vacuums, but it brings more to the table than most of its unremarkable competitors. It has all the usual features including dual suction settings, multiple cleaning modes, drop and collision-detection sensors, automatic mapping and charging, and an app for monitoring and scheduling cleaning.\n\nCredit: Nicole Gray\n\nSpecifications:\n\nProduct Dimension: 32cm X 33cm X 7.6cmWeight: 3.1kg\n\nColor: Black\n\nDustbin capacity: 600ml\n\nCleaning mode: Path, Spot, Edge, MAX\n\nCharging time: < 300min\n\nCleaning time: up to 120min\n\nPower: 100-240VAC 50/60HZ 22W\n\nIt also features a proprietary filtration system that separates dust from larger pieces of debris, a physical remote control with a digital display, and portable electronic-fence you can turn on and place in front of areas you don\u2019t want the A9 to vacuum.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the most aesthetically pleasing robot vacuum I\u2019ve ever seen. As a hip-hop obsessed music lover, it feels like the \u201cvinyl record player\u201d design of the A9 was meant specifically for me. I absolutely adore it.\n\nThe A9 isn\u2019t just a pretty face, it\u2019s also a pleasure to operate. Like most robot vacuums, once it\u2019s setup you can operate it via a push-button control on the top of the device. You can start, pause, and resume cleaning cycles with the physical button or use the app (which currently isn\u2019t available on Android 10, but I\u2019m told support is incoming). The app\u2019s fairly no-frills, but covers all the basics such as monitoring the robot\u2018s status in real-time and scheduling cleaning sessions.\n\nWhere the A9 stands out from the crowd is the inclusion of an intuitive physical remote. While not everyone wants yet another remote control lying around the house, it\u2019s a godsend to those of us who are inundated by dozens of apps for dozens of gadgets. You can schedule cleaning cycles, choose between the four cleaning modes, start/pause/resume cleaning, and direct the robot to return to its charging base all using the remote.\n\nCredit: Nicole Gray\n\nOnce the A9 gets going it\u2019s a surprisingly smart and powerful robot. At $279 I wasn\u2019t expecting world-class cleaning capabilities, but it cleans as well as my Ecovacs Deebot (which costs more than twice as much). The two suction settings (normal and high) are incredibly useful.\n\nI have kids and a dog so my floors receive \u201cheavy traffic\u201d all day long. During the daylight hours, when I\u2019m constantly cleaning up food my toddler\u2019s slung across the room and muddy paw prints, I keep the A9 on its high suction setting so that I can get as much crud up as possible. On this setting I\u2019d describe it as just loud enough to distract you from your TV show. It does a fantastic job of sucking up heavy debris, dirt, and dust.\n\nAt night, I set it on \u201cnormal\u201d suction and let it operate on a schedule. It\u2019s not loud enough to wake anyone up since the A9 is quiet enough to blend in with the sounds from our white noise machines.\n\nIt also features two other distinct cleaning modes. There\u2019s an edge mode that focuses on corners and walls and a cyclone mode that deep cleans a specific area. You probably won\u2019t use these two as much, but it\u2019s nice to have the options available.\n\nWhile the cleaning capability is top-notch, it isn\u2019t the smartest robot around. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it does a fair job of getting around and you don\u2019t have to worry about it slamming into your furniture or falling down the stairs. But I had to experiment a little with the placement of its base station.\n\nI first placed it between the wall and a couch in my closet. When I started the cleaning cycle it navigated away from the charger and did its job perfectly. Upon finishing its cycle it tried to return to the base station and couldn\u2019t figure it out. I watched as the A9 bumped into it for a good solid three minutes before it jammed the base against the wall and turned it on its side. Then the A9 took off and started driving around in circles. Eventually I moved the base station to an open expanse of wall and I haven\u2019t had the problem since.\n\nThe A9 also doesn\u2019t handle clothes, towels, shoe strings, or wires very well \u2013 but neither does any other robot vacuum I\u2019ve tried. What\u2019s cool about the A9 is that it comes with an electronic wall. This little rectangle shaped device runs on two AA batteries and, when placed, creates an invisible wall that\u2019ll keep the robot away from those things.\n\nI\u2019ve used robots with apps that allow you to set up \u201cno-go\u201d zones, but this intuitive solution is great for those of us with a constantly changing room layout. I don\u2019t have to cancel cleaning for the night If my kid leaves a half-finished Lego project on the floor, I just toss the wall down and turn it on and the robot ignores the area.\n\nThe A9 is impressive. Its extra features make it a serious contender for best in class when it comes to robots under $300. I highly recommend this one to anyone in the market for their first robot vacuum cleaner. It also makes a fantastic second robot for people who have two or more floors or a home large enough to merit the extra coverage.\n\nThis post includes affiliate links to products that you can buy online.
