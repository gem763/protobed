Footballers' Wives will be making a comeback, with stage musical spin off of the hit TV show confirmed by its creators (Helen Latham, Zoe Lucker, Laila and Sarah, pictured)\n\nSpeaking to the Radio Times, Maureen Chadwick confirmed that a musical spin off of the show is being written.\n\nWith music and lyrics written by Kath Gotts, the adaption will be based on the first series of Footballers' Wives, which followed Tanya Turner and her marriage to footballer, Jason.\n\nIt's thought the show will feature a whole new cast with auditions taking place at the end of the year in the hope it will hit theatres in 2020.\n\nWhile the stage show is in the works fans will be disappointed by producer Liz Lake's admission that there are no plans to bring the show back to screens at present.\n\nDrama: With music and lyrics written by Kath Gotts, the adaption will be based on the first series of Footballers' Wives, which followed Tanya Turner and her marriage to footballer, Jason\n\nShe told the Radio Times: 'If there's an appetite for it, and enough people want it, it would be worth having that conversation,' but added: 'I think we'd prefer to have an update than a reboot, a revival moving it forward.'\n\n'It's more than just nostalgia, it's about seeing what life is like now.'\n\nZoe Lucker, who played Turner in the original, remains cautious, pointing out: 'The thing that would worry me is, what if it wasn't as good?'\n\n'I always panic about that. The fact that people still talk about it the way they do, I would hate for any of us to go back and for any of us to be disappointed and it would be such a shame.'\n\nLiz Lake appeared on BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier this month, joking about working on a reboot as the Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy story leaking scandal broke.\n\nIconic: It's thought the show will feature a whole new cast with the show's original stars including Zoe Lucker, who has remained cautious about a reboot, replaced\n\nMuch to the devastation of devoted fans, Footballers' Wives came off-air after five seasons in 2006, following its 2002 launch, with the programme reaching icon status due to baby-swapping, murder and cheating storylines.\n\nAnd despite being shelved a whopping 13 years ago, the show was hurtled back into prominence when Coleen and Rebekah's spat led to fans comparing some of the wild storylines to the real life row.\n\nLiz chatted on the Today show alongside Real Housewives Of Cheshire star Magali Gorr\u00e9, who is married to Surinamese former footballer Dean Gorr\u00e9 and claims to know Coleen.\n\nHost Nick Robinson opened up the chat with: 'It's one of those examples where truth is stranger than fiction I bet you wish you'd dreamt up this as we speak'.\n\nMuch to the joy of fans, Liz said: 'I'm typing as we speak! Wouldn't [another series] be nice? Coleen. We used to get accused of being hyperbole you know!\n\n'I can tell you there were times we were writing stories where honest to God there'd be news stories on the radio where I'd have to stop what I was doing because the writing happened prior to shooting and by the time it went out it would look like we had stolen the story on the radio'.\n\nShocker: Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy's story leaking scandal has understandably been likened to a storyline from the Noughties' TV hit (pictured together in 2017)\n\nShe said: 'I remember one time I had to call a producer saying \"What do I do? Do I write this because it will be old news by this time?'\n\nShedding light on the show and it's empowering ways, she went on: 'I'll make no mistake it was subversively feminist...\n\n'It was a fabulously fertile ground where we could explore this zeitgeist moment when celeb magazine culture was growing beyond the vanity pieces for actors singers and royals. It was't just OK! Magazine anymore smoothing feathers...\n\n'It was Heat Magazine being b****y. Big Brother was still a phenomenon, the internet was finding its feet and among this was a world of vast footballers salaries and youngbuck athletes...\n\n'Then there were their girlfriends and wives who could buy new faces and bodies to become these alpha females against these alpha males. that's a massively complex thing to want to examine but basically a load of thinking feminists'.\n\nIn a fantastic twist, Nick then demanded that she 'get back to writing'.\n\nThe full interview is available in Radio Times magazine, out now.", "description": "Fans have been desperate for a return of iconic TV show Footballers' Wives.", "authors": ["Joanna Crawley", "Ciara Farmer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/08/19980504-0-image-a-13_1571643616308.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
