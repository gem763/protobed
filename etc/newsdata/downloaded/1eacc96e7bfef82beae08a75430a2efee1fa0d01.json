The man, whose nationality had not been revealed, is expected to receive some or all of the $25 million U.S. bounty that had been placed on Baghdadi\u2019s head, according to the officials. One official said he was a Sunni Arab who turned against the Islamic State because one of his relatives had been killed by the group.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Islamic State turncoat had been cultivated as an asset by the Syrian Democratic Forces, the predominantly Kurdish militia that became the ground troops for the U.S.-led campaign to destroy the terrorist group\u2019s self-proclaimed caliphate in eastern Syria. SDF leaders then handed control of the agent to U.S. intelligence operatives, who spent weeks vetting him until they were sure he was genuine, the officials said.\n\nA months-long effort to exploit the intelligence breakthrough began over the summer, but only in the past month did the informant\u2019s tips lead to an opportunity to act.\n\n\u201cIt was assessed for quite a while that the person might have the key to the lock,\u201d said one U.S. official familiar with the matter. \u201cThat only really seriously became clear within the last couple of weeks.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post previously reported the contributions of a disaffected Islamic State operative in exposing the location of Baghdadi\u2019s hideout. SDF leader Gen. Mazloum Abdi told NBC News on Monday that one of his organization\u2019s informants had helped lead the Americans to Baghdadi\u2019s compound, and said personal items, including underwear, were taken from the compound for DNA testing to confirm Baghdadi\u2019s presence in the building. Neither the Pentagon nor the White House has officially commented on the presence of a high-level mole inside the mission to kill or capture Baghdadi.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nArmy Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, answered indirectly when asked Monday whether someone affiliated with the SDF was directly involved in the raid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on what may or may not have happened with the SDF on the objective,\u201d he said. \u201cThe actions on the objective, the aircraft coming in, the aircraft overhead and the soldiers conducting the assault, was a U.S.-only operation.\u201d\n\nThe description of the informant and his contribution was provided by two current and former U.S. officials and a Middle East-based official, all privy to detailed information about the Saturday raid. All three spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe what was a highly secret intelligence and military operation.\n\nAD\n\nOne official knowledgeable about the informant said the man was a trusted facilitator and logistics aide who was involved in helping Baghdadi move among safe houses in the Idlib area before relocating to the compound where he met his end. The informant, who was described as a committed and even enthusiastic participant in the mission, provided essential personal details about the reclusive terrorist leader, including the fact that he always traveled with a suicide belt so he could kill himself if cornered. The informant was so trusted that at times he escorted members of Baghdadi\u2019s family to get medical care.\n\nAD\n\nBaghdadi\u2019s compound was stormed by members of the military\u2019s elite Delta Force and 75th Ranger Regiment, several U.S. officials have said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation. Along with them were military working dogs that chased the militant leader as he tried to flee.\n\nThe commandos blasted their way into the house after a firefight and later cornered Baghdadi in a tunnel beneath the building. The Iraqi terrorist had taken three of his children with him, apparently as human shields.\n\nAD\n\nBaghdadi detonated his suicide belt after one of the U.S. team\u2019s military dogs charged him. He and his three children were killed and their bodies partly buried in debris as the tunnel\u2019s ceiling collapsed. Two of his wives also were killed in the operation.\n\nU.S. officials said the informant was vetted with particular care as intelligence agencies sought to avoid a repeat of the CIA\u2019s 2009 disaster at Khost, Afghanistan, when a Jordanian informant with promising information about al-Qaeda leaders detonated a bomb during a meeting, killing seven American intelligence operatives along with a Jordanian and an Afghan driver.\n\nAD\n\nOne U.S. official said the informant flipped sides because he had \u201cclearly lost faith\u201d in the Islamic State. Despite his help, plans to kill or capture Baghdadi were scuttled or shifted multiple times as the situation changed on the ground.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember how many times that we felt like, \u2018Okay, we\u2019ve got him,\u2019 \u201d the official said. \u201cThe last couple of months, we felt it was coming together, but it wasn\u2019t until about the last month where we felt, \u2018Okay, this time it\u2019s for real.\u2019 \u201d\n\nU.S. and Middle Eastern officials say the raid was the culmination of years of work involving a half-dozen foreign partners and allies. Since at least 2015, teams of U.S. commandos, accompanied by Iraqi and Kurdish forces, were embedded in the region specifically to search for Baghdadi and other senior Islamic State leaders. The teams achieved multiple successes, such as the killing of Islamic State propaganda chief Abu Muhammad al-Adnani in 2016. But Baghdadi proved to be a much more elusive quarry because of his frequent movement and refusal to use cellphones or other trackable devices.\n\nAD\n\nA Middle Eastern official privy to details of the search said the focus of the manhunt shifted to Idlib over the summer, with teams of U.S. and French operators and top-of-the-line surveillance equipment scouring the region for Baghdadi\u2019s whereabouts.\n\nAD\n\nIdlib, a province occupied by rival militias and far from the Islamic State\u2019s base, initially seemed an unlikely choice, the officials said.\n\n\u201cNobody can get in there,\u201d the U.S. official said, describing it as riddled with Islamist extremists. \u201cThe Russians own the airspace.\u201d\n\nWith the informant\u2019s help, U.S. officials narrowed their focus to the town of Barisha, in northwest Idlib province, where Baghdadi moved into a highly secure compound complete with tunnels. The planning for the raid began last Wednesday, with the expectation that the terrorist chief might be taken alive.\n\nAD\n\nThe assault force surrounded the compound and did a \u201ccall out,\u201d one official recounted, telling the occupants to surrender.\n\nAD\n\nAlmost a dozen children emerged along with several adults, but Baghdadi remained inside, fleeing with three of his children into the tunnel where he was finally cornered and triggered the suicide vest.\n\nThe assault force commander opted not to retrieve the bodies of those killed with Baghdadi who were still wearing suicide vests, the official said. \u201cPeople were lying there dead under all this rubble,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe\u2019d have to dig them out. And they\u2019ve got sensitized explosives on them. It\u2019s just too dangerous.\u201d\n\nBaghdadi\u2019s head was apparently intact after the explosion, and U.S. operators were convinced of his identity even before a field DNA test was conducted for confirmation, the official said.\n\nOne of the commandos radioed his impressions.\n\n\u201cLooking at him. This is Baghdadi,\u201d the operator said, according to the official. \u201cJackpot.\u201d\n\nDan Lamothe contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The informant, whose nationality has not revealed, is expected to receive some or all of the $25 million bounty that had been placed on Baghdadi\u2019s head, according to the officials.", "authors": ["National Security Reporter Covering Terrorism", "Rogue States", "Weapons Proliferation", "Ellen Nakashima", "National Security Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4hwxJjN7-OhWXYanuf1kkJ5Pcl8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SKLQNMX2UAI6TAMQNPSN5NLOAE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
