During the raid on the small community in the province of Idlib many householders were too terrified to go out. He said: \u201cWhoever was driving or walking outside that night got shot.\u201d\n\nHe said houses were hit with bullets, and there were reports of women being so terrified they suffered miscarriages.\n\nBarisha said several residents had been injured and had to be carried to hospital.\n\nAn elderly couple fleeing the gun battle had been shot in the legs as they tried to make it to their son\u2019s home.\n\nBarisha said: \u201cThe villagers had no clue as to who was in the house and what happened there that night.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images/EyeEm)\n\nKurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces claim a contact stole Baghdadi\u2019s underwear and Baghdadi\u2019s identity was confirmed using DNA testing before the raid.\n\nBut it is not known if the contact was then awarded the \u00a320million reward being advertised by the American authorities.\n\nThe location of Baghdadi\u2019s lair has surprised many counter-terror experts because it lies just 20 miles from the border with Turkey.\n\nIt bears some similarity to the way in which al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden hid out in a large compound in a military area of Pakistan before being killed in a US special forces raid in 2011.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE People in Barisha, a village in North West Syria, had no idea they were living next to the Islamic State leader until US forces attacked his home and Baghdadi blew himself up", "authors": ["Chris Hughes", "Image", "Abaca Pa Images", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Getty Images Eyeem"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20749915.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Abu-Bakr-Al-Baghdadi-IS-Leader-Appears-In-First-Video-In-Five-Years.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
