I was scared a little bit... very nervous. But she was pretty sure. She said, \u2018congratulations\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Oh, okay, that\u2019s great.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe plays top seed Kiki Bertens in the other semi-final after the Dutchwoman advanced on Thursday.", "description": "Fourth seed Aryna Sabalenka beat doubles partner and Belgian sixth seed Elise Mertens 6-4 3-6 7-5 to top their group and qualify for the semi-finals of the WTA Elite Trophy in Zhuhai, China on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
