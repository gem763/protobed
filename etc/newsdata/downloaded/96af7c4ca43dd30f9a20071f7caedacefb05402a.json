In a post on the Hydrogen-focused H4Vuser.net website, Jannard blames the Hydrogen One\u2019s unnamed Chinese ODM (original design manufacturer) for having \u201csignificantly under-performed\u201d and making it \u201cimpossible\u201d to fix the issues with the phone.\n\nNow Jannard\u2019s attention is on the Hydrogen Two as well as a long-promised camera module that will work with both phones. The Hydrogen Two is being designed \u201cvirtually from scratch\u201d in partnership with a new ODM that is \u201cclearly more capable of building and supporting the product we (and our customers) demand,\u201d Jannard says.\n\nMeanwhile RED itself is now working on the cinema camera module, since the previous ODM \u201cwas not going to competently complete the module that they committed and guaranteed to do,\u201d according to Jannard. The new module is called Komodo and its capability will supposedly \u201cvastly exceed\u201d the one that was originally planned. Jannard says it won\u2019t match the existing high-end RED cameras, unsurprisingly, but it\u2019s intended to be a \u201ccomplementary camera for cinema-grade images at the highest level at lower pricing.\u201d\n\nHydrogen One owners will get \u201csignificant preferential treatment\u201d for Hydrogen Two and camera module orders, Jannard says, including an unspecified discount. No word on when either product will land, though it\u2019d be best to be skeptical about RED\u2019s commitments in any case.", "description": "RED founder Jim Jannard has offered a partial explanation for the Hydrogen One phone\u2019s troubles while announcing the first details on the device\u2019s successor.
