Now, it\u2019s actually been delivered to people before that official release date. As The Guardian reports, Amazon shipped around 800 orders of the new novel on Tuesday in the United States, which, according to a statement from the book\u2019s publisher Penguin Random House, was \u201cdue to a retailer error which has now been rectified.\u201d \u201cWe appreciate that readers have been waiting patiently, in some cases for more than 30 years, for the much anticipated sequel,\u201d Penguin Random House said to The Guardian. \u201cIn order to ensure our readers around the world receive their copies on the same day, our global publication date remains Tuesday 10 September.\u201d\n\nblessed be The Testaments\n\n(may the book open) pic.twitter.com/hhJx1rULDt \u2014 Amy Cutlip (@amy_cutlip) September 3, 2019\n\nThe surprise early shipping has generated plenty of excitement from fans who\u2019ve gotten their hands on the novel a week early. \u201cIt\u2019s here! Can I use an excessive amount of exclamation points? It\u2019s here!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d tweeted Daniel Valentin, a high-school English teacher in Chappaqua. Some Amazon customers were informed they\u2019d be getting the book early: \u201cGood news!\u201d a note sent to Valentin read. \u201cWe\u2019re able to get part of your order to you sooner than we originally promised.\u201d Valentin assumed the embargo had been lifted. \u201cEvidently,\u201d he wrote in a note to Vulture, \u201cthat is not the case.\u201d\n\nLexi Beach, the co-owner of the Astoria Bookshop, says it\u2019s not that unusual for books to be shipped before their intended embargo, a point brought up on a Twitter thread discussing the early shipment of The Testaments by an Amazon customer named Erin Jones. \u201cI preordered Atticus\u2019s The Truth About Magic months ago,\u201d Jones told me. This week, the book showed up a week before it was scheduled for publication, along with some dog bones she\u2019d ordered. \u201cIt just showed up in the mail,\u201d she wrote in a message. \u201cWas completely surprised.\u201d\n\nWhether the early shipments were planned, as some contended, or not, the broken embargo did, in a sense, serve the customer \u2014 which Amazon is better equipped to do than fellow booksellers without facing repercussions in the industry. Indeed, the audience most frustrated by all this are independent booksellers. \u201cThe thing about these embargo agreements is that they\u2019re basically unenforceable, at least as far as Amazon is concerned,\u201d Matt Keliher, the manager of Subtext Bookstore in Saint Paul, Minnesota, explained to Vulture. \u201cBut I was just looking at the one I signed, and they list very clearly the punishments for breaking it. If an independent bookstore made an error like that, there are real punishments that Random House can inflict on us that they really can\u2019t on Amazon.\u201d If Keliher broke the agreement, he continued, they could stop sending him books, forcing him, essentially, to close. \u201cIt\u2019s a real threat to a store like mine, but it\u2019s not a threat to a store like Amazon, and that\u2019s why independents abide by these rules and Amazon doesn\u2019t.\u201d For independent booksellers, the harm mostly comes down to the perception that if readers want to get a book before its scheduled to be published, Amazon may be a better bet than placing a preorder with their local bookstore. \u201cAn event like this changes the mind of the consumer in a way that\u2019s not really measurable,\u201d Keliher continued. \u201cIt\u2019s what Amazon has been good at doing across all markets for a long time and it\u2019s why they are as powerful as they are.\u201d\n\nBack in May, I signed an embargo agreement on behalf of my bookstore stating that I would \"ensure that [#TheTestaments] is stored in a monitored and locked, secured area and not placed on the selling floor prior to the on-sale date.\" \u2014 Lexi Beach (@lexiatwork) September 4, 2019\n\nBut there will be ZERO consequences for $amzn violating not just the fine print but the entire basis of this embargo agreement some exec surely signed digitally through Adobe Sign just like the rest of us did. \u2014 Lexi Beach (@lexiatwork) September 4, 2019\n\nAs to why or how this really happened, both Amazon and Penguin Random House are unwilling to offer any insight. Amazon has given no public statement, and declined to give an interview to Vulture or any other publications; Penguin Random House declined to speak beyond their general statement to the press. While they did, vaguely, suggest they would be addressing the problem, they did not offer any information as to how they would go about reprimanding the most powerful retailer in the world.\n\nUpdate, September 5, 12:30 p.m.: Late Wednesday, the American Booksellers Association announced that it has already been in contact with officials at the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission about the damage Amazon is inflicting on the publishing industry. \u201cAmazon\u2019s latest actions only further underscore how important it is that the appropriate federal agencies thoroughly investigate Amazon\u2019s destructive business practices,\u201d the ABA wrote in a statement. On Thursday morning, Amazon finally broke its silence. \u201cDue to a technical error a small number of customers were inadvertently sent copies of Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Testaments,\u201d a spokesperson for the company wrote in an email. \u201cWe apologize for this error; we value our relationship with authors, agents, and publishers, and regret the difficulties this has caused them and our fellow booksellers.\u201d", "description": "An Amazon error, according to Penguin Random House, led to the release of around 800 copies of Margaret Atwood\u2019s \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d sequel \u201cThe Testaments\u201d before the book\u2019s planned release.", "authors": ["Lila Shapiro", "Jackson Mchenry"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/04/04-margaret-atwood-the-testaments.w1200.h630.jpg"}
