We really had to play for 80 minutes... it was a good day at the office for us,\" Itoje said.\n\nEngland started slowly in the World Cup with an unflashy win over Tonga, but they have steadily improved and handed Australia their heaviest defeat in the competition, 40-16, in last week's quarterfinals.\n\n\"I think we're just building,\" Itoje said. \"Game by game, week by week we're building. We're pushing in the right direction. We haven't done the job yet but we're one step closer.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Towering lock Maro Itoje warned England the job wasn't done yet after he inspired a stunning Rugby World Cup semifinal victory over New Zealand with a man-of-the-match performance on Saturday.
