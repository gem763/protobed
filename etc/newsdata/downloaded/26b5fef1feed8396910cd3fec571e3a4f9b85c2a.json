Jeffrey Clark Jr.\u2019s relatives reported concerns about his behavior and extremist rhetoric after the mass shooting. (Gene J. Puskar/AP)\n\nA D.C. man who expressed hatred for minorities and glorified violence on social media disavowed what he called his \u201cdisturbing online presence\u201d and pledged to \u201cstay away from the darkest corners of social media\u201d as he was sentenced Friday to 10 months\u2019 time served on a gun charge in federal court.\n\nJeffrey Raphiel Clark Jr., 31, will be released from jail after being locked up since his arrest in November at his Bloomingdale neighborhood home, where investigators found fliers from a neo-Nazi organization, boxes of ammunition and a Nazi flag.\n\nHis arrest came after family members reported concerns about Clark\u2019s behavior following the mass shooting at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in October and the suicide of Clark\u2019s younger brother. The FBI turned up Clark\u2019s name among social media followers of the man since charged with hate crimes in the synagogue attack.\n\n[Alleged D.C. white nationalist denied bail on gun-related charges]\n\nClark had told investigators he was a member of white-nationalist groups and that he and his brother became interested in guns \u201cbecause they believed there was going to be a civil war,\u201d according to an account of his statement filed in court.\n\nStanding at the courtroom podium Friday, and reading from notes, Clark said his experience at the D.C. jail had made him reevaluate his views and led him to try to improve himself \u201cmentally and morally.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy words did have consequences,\u201d he said before apologizing for the \u201cdamage\u201d he had caused friends, family and the community.\n\nProsecutors and Clark\u2019s attorney both recommended a sentence of 10 months, or time served, and the judge agreed after hearing directly from Clark for the first time.\n\nU.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly said he was concerned about the animosity Clark previously expressed toward racial and religious minorities, but \u201cwe don\u2019t punish people for having hate in their hearts.\u201d He praised Clark for seeming to have distanced himself from those views.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney John Cummings, in the government\u2019s sentencing recommendation, had urged the judge to consider Clark\u2019s mind-set before his arrest.\n\n\u201cThe defendant\u2019s online postings, statements, and items found inside his home, evidenced an individual with a deep-rooted hatred for certain minorities and a penchant for glorifying violence,\u201d Cummings wrote.\n\nThe charge against Clark involved the volatile mix of guns and drugs, but much of the courtroom discussion Friday centered on whether the government should or could restrict Clark\u2019s online speech after he is released from jail. The prosecutor had asked the judge, as a condition of ongoing supervision by the court, to prohibit Clark from \u201cthreatening behavior\u201d online \u2014 and to require follow-up meetings with the FBI as requested by the bureau.\n\nBut the judge asked, \u201cIs it appropriate for me to deal with the hatred?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs reprehensible as that may be, he has a right to hold those beliefs,\u201d Cummings responded. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking to interfere with his First Amendment rights, but he can\u2019t threaten people.\u201d\n\nThe judge agreed to impose a three-year term of court supervision but did not include the specific restrictions the prosecutor requested.\n\nIn explaining his client\u2019s new perspective, Clark\u2019s attorney David W. Bos told the court that Clark\u2019s brother\u2019s death and the time Clark has spent in jail have made him \u201creevaluate many of the choices he has made in his young life.\u201d Only days before his arrest, Clark\u2019s younger brother, Edward, 23, fatally shot himself on Roosevelt Island near Washington.\n\nClark \u201cis deeply sorry for those choices and is committed to making better choices,\u201d Bos wrote before the sentencing hearing. \u201cHe can\u2019t escape his past but he has the motivation and support for a brighter future.\u201d\n\nClark pleaded guilty in July to possessing a firearm while using or being addicted to illegal drugs \u2014 a charge that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Clark has no previous criminal convictions, and prosecutors agreed to seek a sentence within the federal guidelines ranging from 10 months to 16 months.\n\nThe office of U.S. Attorney Jessie Liu noted in the plea agreement that its investigation \u201cuncovered no evidence\u201d Clark had advance knowledge of the attack on the Pittsburgh synagogue or that he \u201cwas planning an independent attack against similar targets\u201d in Washington.\n\n[D.C. man arrested on gun charge after relatives alert police to his alleged white-nationalist outbursts]\n\nBefore he was arrested, two relatives contacted the FBI and reported that Clark had become increasingly outspoken and agitated following his brother\u2019s death, court filings show. The brothers had \u201cfantasized about killing \u2018Jews and blacks,\u2019 \u201d the relatives told the FBI, according to the filing.\n\nClark was arrested Nov. 9 during a search of the home he shared with his father, brother and sister, according to court records. Agents said in court filings that they seized a marijuana-growing operation from his bedroom and three firearms \u2014 a handgun, a shotgun and a rifle.\n\nCourt filings provide details about Clark\u2019s personal story. He moved from Utah to Washington as a teenager, and he graduated from St. John\u2019s College High School in Northwest in 2007.\n\nBefore his arrest, prosecutors said Clark led an \u201caimless lifestyle.\u201d He was unemployed, regularly used marijuana and played video games such as \u201cEthnic Cleansing.\u201d\n\nClark told investigators he had smoked pot \u201con a nearly daily basis\u201d since he was 15. \u201cClark had tried to stop using marijuana in the past, but had been unable to do so,\u201d according to prosecutors.\n\nHis father and mother have attended every court proceeding, Clark\u2019s lawyer wrote, and both have regularly visited him at the D.C. jail.\n\nRead more:\n\nMaryland top court upholds child pornography charge against teen who texted graphic video of herself to friends\n\nMan spends 82 days in jail after bringing in honey to the U.S.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Jeffrey Clark is sentenced to 10 months\u2019 time served on gun charge after relatives reported concerns about his behavior in the wake of Pittsburgh synagogue shootings.", "authors": ["Ann E.
