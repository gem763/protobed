With so much tissue being taken out, she then had plastic surgery to replace part of her heel.\n\nAlthough the procedure seemed to go to plan, the disease returned, invading her groin, leg, lung and stomach lining.\n\nAfter enduring further surgery and immunotherapy, Mrs Solvason has been told she is cancer-free for now but has been warned the disease could return.\n\nRachel Solvason claims she was left with a 'gaping hole' in her foot after she dismissed skin cancer for a verruca. The mother-of-three is pictured left in hospital being treated for melanoma. Having beaten the disease, she is encouraging people to dress up to raise money for Stand Up To Cancer with her sons Ciaran and Josh (pictured together right)\n\nMrs Solvason had an operation to remove the tumour from her left heel (pictured after). With so much tissue being taken out, she then had plastic surgery to replace part of her foot\n\nSpeaking of the ordeal, Mrs Solvason said: 'It started when I felt what I thought was a piece of glass stuck in the bottom of my foot\n\n'Eventually it grew into what looked like a verruca. I treated it with over-the-counter cream but nothing seemed to work.\n\n'Everyone I showed it to thought it was a verruca too, but by Christmas it had become the size of a penny and was quite sore to walk on.'\n\nMrs Solvason had a swab taken by her GP, who confirmed it was not a verruca.\n\nThe mother-of-three was referred for a biopsy at Kidderminster Hospital at the end of January 2017. She was later diagnosed with cancer, six months after she first noticed the blemish.\n\n'The diagnosis was so hard to take in,' Mrs Solvason said. 'I've always loved the sun but I'm sure the rest of my body has seen more sun than the sole of my foot.\n\n'Even the consultant was shocked as it didn't look like a typical melanoma and was in an unusual place.\n\n'The dermatologist decided to remove it there and then, so I was left with a gaping hole in the bottom of my foot.'\n\nMrs Solvason (pictured left in hospital) went on to develop cancer again, with the disease invading her leg, lung and stomach lining. The 'gaping hole' in her heel is pictured right\n\nMrs Solvason claims the 'worst thing' was breaking the news to her sons (pictured together)\n\nMrs Solvason, an administrator at a GP surgery, had further surgery to clear the diseased tissue at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital in March.\n\nThis left her with a 'hole' for eight weeks, forcing her to get about on crutches.\n\nMrs Solvason then had her heel 'filled' with a substance made from the cartilage of cows and sharks. This was covered with a skin graft from her thigh.\n\nThings seemed to be on the up until she noticed a lump in her groin in November 2017.\n\n'They thought it was just a cyst and I was told to enjoy my Christmas,' she said.\n\n'But between Christmas and New Year 2018 the biopsy results came back and showed the lump in my groin was in fact melanoma. I was devastated.'\n\nIn January last year, Mrs Solvason had all her lymph nodes removed in an effort to beat the disease.\n\nA few months later, however, scans showed the melanoma had spread to her leg, lung and stomach lining.\n\nSurgeons managed to remove the tumour from her stomach, however, she required immunotherapy to tackle the disease in her lung.\n\nMrs Solvason has been told she is cancer-free but still has immunotherapy every four weeks to prevent the disease returning.\n\nMrs Solvason's groin is pictured left after surgery to remove a recurring tumour. The scar from the procedure on her heel is seen right. Mrs Solvason has been told she is cancer-free for now but still has treatment every four weeks to prevent the disease returning\n\nMrs Solvason is raising money for Stand Up To Cancer, a joint fundraising campaign between Cancer Research UK and Channel 4.\n\nHer and two of her sons, Josh, 20, and Ciaran, 15, are sporting bright socks and orange tutus to encourage people to dress up and raise money for the cause.\n\nMrs Solvason, who is also mother to Lewis, 22, said: 'Having cancer has been a massive rollercoaster but the worst thing about it was having to tell my sons each time. Its been hard on the whole family.\n\n'I'm a feisty person, I've had to be, and it gives me great pleasure to kick back at cancer by jazzing up my damaged foot and joining the Stand Up To Cancer campaign.'\n\nJane Redman, from Cancer Research UK West Midlands, added: 'We are very grateful to Rachel, Josh and Ciaran for helping to raise awareness with such panache.\n\n'Supporting Stand Up To Cancer enables scientists to explore brave new ways to fight the disease and develop radical treatments, meaning more lives are saved.'", "description": "Rachel Solvason, 40, from\u00a0Worcestershire, had an operation to remove the tumour.
