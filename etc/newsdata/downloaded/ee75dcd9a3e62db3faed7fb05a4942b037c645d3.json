If the worst-case scenario were to come to pass and the NBA were to sever ties with China, where in the world would the league turn for growth?\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nFor nearly a decade the league has had a presence in Africa and just last week launched its first foray into India.\n\nBoth countries present opportunity, but sports economist Victor Matheson says the lure of the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy in India is perfect for the NBA. \u201cThe growth rate is way bigger than anything we\u2019ve seen in any other major sport,\u201d Matheson told FOX Business. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly potential. India\u2019s got 1.2 billion people and not a lot of big domestic leagues, so it\u2019s the sort of place you can get market penetration.\u201d\n\nStill, it is Africa that is getting a fast break from the league. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced the creation of the Basketball Africa League (BAL) in February at the NBA All-Star Game. A collaboration between the NBA and the sport\u2019s global governing body, FIBA, the 12-team league begins play in March. Recreational hoopster and former President Barack Obama will have a role with the new league.\n\nThe BAL will be a continent-wide effort that will involve six national champions -- Nigeria, Angola, Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia and Senegal \u2014 which will automatically qualify for the competition. The remaining six teams will come through international qualifiers later this year.\n\nThe BAL\u2019s host cities will be Cairo (Egypt), Dakar (Senegal), Lagos (Nigeria), Luanda (Angola), Rabat (Morocco) and either Monastir or Tunis (Tunisia). The host city for the first-ever BAL Final Four and BAL Final will be Kigali, Rwanda. Nike and Jordan Brand will be the exclusive outfitter of the new professional league featuring 12 club teams.\n\nThe \u201ccontinental\u201d approach, however, gives Matheson pause. \u201cI don\u2019t have a great grasp on whether you could have a Nigerian be the face of African basketball or whether he can only be the face of Nigerian basketball. I think we see a little bit of that in soccer, that the continent \u2013 at least to some extent \u2013 embraces all of the successes of the teams and players from continent. I suspect the ethnic and nationality boundaries are enough that you can\u2019t think of Africa as just one place and that, if you\u2019re the NBA, you want a star out of a really big market (within the continent).\u201d\n\n\"There is already an unprecedented demand for basketball in India\" - Sacramento Kings owner Vivek Ranadive\n\nIn India, where there may be more potential, there also may be more challenges. The NBA had to add seats, video screens fit for an arena, extra lighting and other elements considered standard at the NBA level for the first-ever preseason game in Mumbai\u2019s NSCI Dome.\n\n\u201cI think it's inevitable that there will be state-of-the-art arenas in major cities in India, in part because these are multi-use facilities and live entertainment is increasingly important here as well,\u201d Silver told ESPN in India, \u201cOf course, a great arena can have concerts and other shows. But we do need to see those arenas over time in order to play more games.\"\n\nIn 2017, India's sports sponsorship industry surpassed the $1 billion mark for the first time. The country\u2019s cricket league, the Indian Premier League, was founded in 2008 and has become the most-attended cricket league in the world. It ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues as recently as 2014.\n\nEY in its 2017 report, \u201cSports in India\u201d declared, \u201cThe sports sector in India has witnessed a number of recent developments, which have contributed to its significant growth.\u201d\n\nNo one may know that better than Sacramento Kings owner Vivek Ranadiv\u00e9. A native of India, he brought his Kings to Mumbai to square off against the Indiana Pacers.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"I have no doubt that these games will serve as an inspiration and catalyst for even more exciting things to come. There is already an unprecedented demand for basketball in India,\u201d Ranadiv\u00e9 told Indian publication ET Sport, \u201cSince my visit to India with Adam Silver five years ago, over 10 million boys and girls have participated in Jr. NBA camps and tickets to this week\u2019s games in my hometown nearly sold out in two hours.\u201d\n\nWhile the Kings were in Mumbai, the team joined the NBA in a week-long series of grassroots community activities in India, including programming from NBA Cares, Jr. NBA, Her Time to Play and NBA Academy.\n\nBut success will have to come from a hometown formula. \u200b\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine India embracing the NBA or the English Premier League (soccer) until you actually have a star that local people can grab onto,\u201d said sports economist Matheson, \u201cthat\u2019s exactly what happened in China.\u201d\n\nIt was Yao Ming, a 7-foot superstar in the Chinese Basketball Association, who was selected by the Houston Rockets with the first overall pick in the 2002 NBA draft. He became a superstar in the U.S. leading the Rockets to the NBA Playoffs four times and become a legend in China.\n\nToday, Ming is the head of the Chinese Basketball Association and is not happy with his former team or former league. Commissioner Silver at a press briefing in Japan on his way to China said that he had spoken with Ming and described him as \"extremely upset,\" \"extremely unsettled\" and \"extremely hot.\"\n\nWhere the NBA takes that next is being watched closely.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM", "description": "The NBA needs to explore other options now that it's facing roadblocks in China - a look at the league's efforts in Africa and India.", "authors": ["Jason Schott"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/India-NBA-GettyImages-1173853758-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
