When we decoded the results, I nearly fell off my chair.\n\n'The improvement in morphology - the size and shape of the sperm - was dramatic.'\n\nThe study involved 56 healthy men aged 19 to 30, more than half of whom were found to have poor-quality sperm.\n\nHalf were put on the lycopene capsules, taking them morning and evening with a glass of water, while half were given dummy pills which looked the same.\n\nWHAT CLASSES AS A LOW SPERM COUNT? A low sperm count, known medically as oligozoospermia, occurs when a man has fewer than 15million sperm per millilitre of semen. The NHS warns a low count makes it harder to conceive naturally. Problems with sperm, including a low sperm count and problems with sperm quality, are quite common, it adds on its website. 'They're a factor in around one in three couples who are struggling to get pregnant,' the NHS advice reads. Problems with sperm quality and quantity can be linked with: Hormone imbalances\n\nGenetic problems\n\nHaving had undescended testicles as a baby\n\nGenital infections\n\nPrevious surgery to the testicles or hernia repairs\n\nExcessive alcohol consumption\n\nSmoking and using drugs\n\nCertain medications\n\nAfter 12 weeks, the men taking the tomato pills had almost 40 per cent more fast-swimming sperm, which are important for fertilising an egg to get someone pregnant.\n\nTheir amount of normally shaped and sized sperm, which have a better chance of making a baby, almost doubled. It went from making up around 7.5 per cent of their sperm to 13.5 per cent after three months on the pills.\n\nThe results, published in the European Journal of Nutrition, are important because of the crisis in male fertility, which has seen a fall in the average sperm count of almost 60 per cent.\n\nUp to one in six couples in the UK are unable to conceive, ad in 40 to 50 per cent of cases the problem lies with the man.\n\nJunk food is thought to be part of the problem, although men also harm their sperm through wearing tight underwear, smoking and putting on too much weight.\n\nExperts believe tomatoes may improve sperm quality because the antioxidants they contain prevent damage to the sperm, so that they retain their size and shape and swim better.\n\nA previous study found men who drank tomato juice for six weeks had sperm which moved more efficiently.\n\nBut lycopene is best to get from cooked tomatoes, and the LactoLycopene pills used in the study, which make it easier to absorb into the gut.\n\nDr Elizabeth Williams, first author of the study from the University of Sheffield, said: 'This was a small study and we do need to repeat the work in bigger trials, but the results are very encouraging.\n\n'The next step is to repeat the exercise in men with fertility problems and see if lycopene can increase sperm quality for those men and whether it helps couples conceive and avoid invasive fertility treatments.'", "description": "The key ingredient is lycopene, the chemical which gives tomatoes their red colour and is already thought to reduce blood pressure, according to the researchers at the University of Sheffield.", "authors": ["Victoria Allen Science Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/14/19443788-0-image-a-14_1570541080957.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
