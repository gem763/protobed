She flew into Nepal on a Friday, climbed the 6,584m Chulu Peak on Sunday, drove 12 hours in a bumpy jeep and has arrived in Pokhara to run the Annapurna 100km mountain ultramarathon on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI did it for the challenge to see how far I can push it. For me, just running a race is becoming very boring. It\u2019s not an adventure for me,\u201d the Japan-based Frenchwoman said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like exploring. I hadn\u2019t climbed this year so far, I\u2019d focused on running, I hadn\u2019t done an 8,000m peak like I planned, so I thought I\u2019d do this instead.\u201d\n\nFuchs used a hypoxia chamber to train, but said it is not perfect preparation because it only replicates a lack of oxygen and does not replicate the lack of air pressure. However, she landed and went straight to the 5,000m-high camp, reached the summit through deep snow and then descended straight to Manang village, 3,000m below. The downhill in particular has left her legs tired ahead of the ultramarathon.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy. I\u2019m very sore,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was downhill like crazy, with a big expedition bag. I was my own porter. My Sherpa was not my Sherpa but my climbing partner as we did it alpine style as there are no fixed ropes.\u201d\n\nFuchs, 40, has been climbing since she was 14. Last year she climbed Everest, and plans to be the first woman to summit the five highest mountains in the world in just four months, if she can secure the sponsorship.\n\n\u201cWhen you are in the mountains nothing exists, you are just floating,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like meditation. You forget about everything else you are so focused. It is just magical.\u201d\n\nWhen you are in the mountains nothing exists, you are just floating. It\u2019s like meditation.

It is just magical\n\nCarole Fuchs\n\nFuchs works as a legal adviser, and was sponsored by Showa Holdings, a Japanese holding group and its sports brand Lucent. She said it wouldn\u2019t be possible without the time her employer gives her to do \u201cthese crazy things\u201d.\n\nBut not everyone is afforded that time and money, so Fuchs is raising funds for the Mira Rai Initiative, which has a Hong Kong branch called Exchange & Empower. Rai is a famous trail runner who was lifted out of poverty by the opportunities given to her via running, and hopes to share the same opportunities by getting more Nepalese women into mountain sports.\n\n\u201cIn the high-altitude sphere there aren\u2019t many women, it\u2019s a male world,\u201d Fuchs said. \u201cI want to inspire women to go and do some challenging things in the mountains.\u201d\n\nNow, as Fuchs re-enters populated areas, she is excited to get back into the mountains on Saturday. And then, even more excited to follow up on future expeditions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s peaceful, it\u2019s challenging, and it\u2019s just you. You are with yourself trying to overcome everything that comes you way, more than trail running,\u201d she said.", "description": "Japan-based mountaineer says running ultramarathons is becoming boring as she searches for her physical limit", "authors": ["Mark Agnew", "Carole Fuchs"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/25/a888839c-f6d1-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_image_hires_131615.jpeg?itok=rLpFg02B&v=1571980581", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
