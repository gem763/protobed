Every state but Alaska has confirmed at least one of the 1,604 cases of lung damage\n\nPHE claims vaping is 95 per cent better than smoking and still encourages traditional smokers to make the switch.\n\nIt says vape contains fewer harmful chemicals than standard cigarettes, which burn tobacco and produce tar. E-cigarettes allow users to inhale nicotine in vapour rather than breathing in smoke.\n\nCounterfeit or bootleg e-cigarettes that officials believe have been tinkered with to contain THC have become the prime suspects behind the US deaths.\n\nBut Professor Newton, director of health improvement at PHE, reiterated it had not changed its advice on nicotine containing e-cigarettes.\n\n'Smokers should consider switching completely and vapers should stop smoking,' he told The Sun.\n\n'We are as certain as ever that e-cigarettes are far less harmful than smoking, which kills almost 220 people in England every day.\n\n'Our concern is that the responses we have seen to the problem in the US and in other countries may increase the already widespread misunderstanding about the relative safety of nicotine e-cigarettes, deterring smokers from switching and risk driving vapers who have switched back to smoking.'\n\nThere were just 700,00 vapers in 2012 - a year after the electronic devices burst onto the scene as a 'healthier' alternative to cigarettes\n\n'SMOKING MUST BE STAMPED OUT BY 2030' The UK Government will aim to end smoking in England by 2030 as part of a range of measures to address preventable ill health. Its green paper, released in July, said more needs to be done to improve public health. The paper read: 'Thanks to our concerted efforts on smoking, we now have one of the lowest smoking rates in Europe. 'Yet, for the 14 percent of adults who still smoke, it\u2019s the main risk to health. Smokers are disproportionately located in areas of high deprivation. In Blackpool, one in four pregnant women smoke. In Westminster, it\u2019s one in 50.' The paper proposed offering stop-smoking help to all cigarette users who are admitted to NHS hospitals. It said it wants to reduce the smoking rate to 12 per cent by 2022 and to zero by 2030. 'This includes an ultimatum for industry to make smoked tobacco obsolete by 2030,' the paper added, 'with smokers quitting or moving to reduced risk products like e-cigarettes.'\n\nPHE said similar products were being sold on UK streets and warned users against buying unregulated devices.\n\nThe mystery US illnesses have been dubbed EVALI, which stands for e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury.\n\nIn each case, patients have reported shortness of breath, night sweats and low oxygen levels which almost always leads to feeling sick to their stomachs and vomiting.\n\nNearly half of the confirmed patients wound up in the ICU, and more than a fifth had to be put on ventilators to breathe for them.\n\nSeveral states, including New York, Oregon and Michigan, Washington, Utah, Montana and Rhode Island have attempted to ban flavored e-cigarettes in the wake of the epidemic. Massachusetts even put a temporary ban on the sale of all vapes.\n\nProfessor Newton's comments come after data revealed a record number of Britons were now hooked on the electronic devices.\n\nFigures show an estimated seven per cent of people in the UK regularly vape - up from 6.2 per cent in 2018.\n\nThis means 45 people took up the habit every hour in 2019, bringing the number of vapers from 3.2million to 3.6million in 12 months.\n\nAction on Smoking and Health (ASH) polled more than 12,000 people to come to the conclusion.\n\nThe majority of vapers were ex-smokers (54 per cent), a third of whom claimed their main reason for using them was to help them quit cigarettes.\n\nOne in five said they took up the habit to prevent a relapse back to smoking while 13 per cent said it was a way to save money.\n\nFourteen per cent said they started smoking e-cigarettes because they simply enjoyed it.", "description": "Professor John Newton from Public Health England (PHE) reiterated that vaping was '95 per cent less harmful than traditional cigarettes'.
