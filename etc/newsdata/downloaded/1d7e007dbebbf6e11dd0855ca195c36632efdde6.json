Since then, prices have fallen substantially, with CoreLogic data showing a price drop of 16.29 per cent.\n\nThe area has also seen a surge of renters, now accounting for more than half (56.4 per cent) of the residents compared to owner occupiers according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics \u2013 a sign that prices had been exceeding affordability levels.\n\nPrestige suburbs like Bulimba in Brisbane could see its desirability impacted when the second runway of the Brisbane Airport opens next year. Supplied\n\nWhile new infrastructure is generally a positive, it can also have an adverse effect to the surrounding areas and could turn them into less desirable locations said Zoran Solano, senior buyer's agent at Hot Property Buyers Agent.\n\nMr Solano cited Brisbane Airport's second runway, due to be completed next year, as an example of an infrastructure that could potentially impact the affected suburbs' desirability and growth prospects.\n\n\"The second runway at the Brisbane airport will mean that air traffic noise will effect new suburbs that have never been affected by air traffic noise in the past, potentially subduing demand,\" he said.\n\n\"These include the prestige suburbs of Bulimba, Hawthorne, Norman Park, Tarragindi and Kangaroo Point.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCapital growth shrinks\n\nMr Solano pointed out that gentrification could also potentially turn a previously good investment into a poor performer as it may no longer match the needs of the emerging demographic of the area.\n\nA case in point is Stafford, located 10 kilometres north of Brisbane. Mr Solano said that fundamentally, Stafford is sound - it's close to the Brisbane CBD, it enjoys good transport amenities and it's in an elevated location so the factors are in place for long-term capital growth.\n\nHowever, the suburb's gentrification has resulted in the deterioration of capital growth and rental incomes for some investors.\n\n\"Rental returns for unrenovated properties have dropped by 10 per cent in the last two years,\" said Mr Solano.\n\n\"A lot of people blame the suburb for lack of performance and returns, but what they don't realise is that the suburb has changed, and what people want in terms of housing is different now compared to five years ago.\n\n\"The new residents are generally young, growing family requiring at least three bedroom homes with plenty of space and storage. So investors who bought older, 3-bedroom unrenovated homes, may see their property languish in both value and rental income.\"", "description": "Property investors looking to ride the next wave of growth are being urged to be cautious as the markets move to a new cycle.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5174%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1abb499e1edb143154a9b82ef04f1a3e67539c48", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
