There has also been a 3-month bear channel since June 25 within that bigger channel.\n\nThursday\u2019s reversal up was from a double bottom at the bottom of both channels. Friday then reversed down from a double top at the top of the 3-month channel. A double top and a double bottom in a trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. That means the probability for the bears and bulls is just about the same over the next several days. Traders will look for at least one more reversal.\n\nFriday had a bull body after a big bull reversal up on Thursday. That follow-through makes at least a small sideways to up leg likely this week. Consequently, the bulls will look to buy around a 50% pullback from the 2-day rally.\n\nHowever, when the market is in a Breakout Mode pattern, the odds never greatly favor one side. Therefore, traders know that the 2-day reversal down could easily break below the double bottom. Since the daily chart is in a bear trend and there are measured move targets and a gap below at around 1.08, the odds favor lower prices. This is true even if the bulls get a rally up to the August lower highs first.\n\nOvernight EUR/USD Forex trading\n\nThe EUR/USD 5 minute Forex chart sold off in a tight bear channel overnight. Traders have only been selling.\n\nThe 5-minute chart is almost to a 50% retracement of the 2-day rally. As a result, the bears will begin to take profits. That profit-taking will probably begin within a couple of hours.\n\nOnce there is a 20 pip rally, the bears will switch to selling rallies from selling at the market. Furthermore, they will begin to take profits near the most recent low instead of holding for a further swing down.\n\nAlso, the bulls will begin to buy reversals up from near the most recent low. Both will scalp. This buying low and selling high should convert the tight bear channel into a trading range early in the US session.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Al Brooks covering: EUR/USD.
