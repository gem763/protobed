(Mike McArthur/CBC)\n\n\"I wasn't making a political statement,\" she said. \"My clothes were dirty and I wanted to be more comfortable.\"\n\nBut after the class, she was approached by an instructor and asked to cover up next time. Frizzley argued against the idea that it's up to her to not distract others.\n\n\"The onus is on the individual to stay accountable to their own self restraint and to focus on their practice,\" she said. \"I'm not going to tell someone with tattoos that they need to cover up because I find it distracting.\"\n\nGoing topless in B.C. is not illegal. In 2000, a B.C. Supreme Court judge ruled a woman has the right to bare her breasts in public in \"circumstances that do not offend criminal laws of nudity.\"\n\nFrizzley later wrote about her experience on social media in a post that generated hearty debate in the comments.\n\n\"I didn't expect it to turn into what it has become,\" she said.\n\nFrizzley demonstrates some of her yoga and talks about how 'we need to de-sexualize nudity'\n\nVictoria, B.C.'s Jennifer Frizzley says it's not fair men are allowed to go topless in yoga class while she was asked to cover up. 2:18\n\nDress codes for equality\n\nHot yoga, a type of exercise that's done in temperatures ranging from about 33 C to 40 C, promotes sweating.\n\nFrizzley said she was drenched and would have been very uncomfortable wearing the thick exercise shirt she had brought.\n\n\"I just simply was more comfortable being topless,\" she said. \"I don't think there's anything explicitly sexual about the nude body.\"\n\nAlmost all the men in the class were topless, she added.\n\nFrizzley is now trying to gather enough support to run a topless yoga event. (Mike McArthur/CBC)\n\nKen Mayes, the owner of Quantum Yoga Club, declined to comment. According to the studio's website, \"guests [are asked] to wear both bottoms and tops.\"\n\nThat dress code was added to the website after Frizzley was told to cover up, she said, and a cached version of the website page doesn't show one.\n\n\"Equality calls for the equal treatment of men and women and thus an equal dress code,\" Frizzley said.\n\nFrizzley said she recognized businesses can set their own rules and policies but, she added, customers can also choose where to spend their money.\n\nShe's started a Facebook group to create a community of yoga-enthusiasts comfortable going topless and hopes to connect with other local studios to host events.", "description": "Jennifer Frizzley wasn\u2019t thinking of making a statement when she first took off her shirt during her hot yoga class \u2014 she was simply overheating and didn\u2019t have a sports bra with her.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5269457.1567564335!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/jenni-frizzley-topless-yogi.jpg"}
