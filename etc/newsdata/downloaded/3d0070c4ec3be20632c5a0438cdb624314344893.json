However, if you don\u2019t care about torque or top speeds, there\u2019s the Toyota i-ROAD \u2013 an insanely cute three-wheeled smartcar that\u2019s only slightly bigger than a motorcycle.\n\nWe took one out for a quick spin at the Tokyo Motor Show\u2026 and almost spun out in the process.\n\nThe Toyota i-ROAD is a personal mobility vehicle (PMV) designed for city dwellers.\n\nIt\u2019s powered by a lithium-ion battery that provides juice to two 1.9kW electric motors mounted in the front wheels.\n\nPhoto: Gizmodo Australia\n\nBeing completely electric, it emits zero CO2 emissions during operation. A full recharge from a conventional residential power supply takes around three hours.\n\nToyota has been manufacturing the i-ROAD since 2013, but the latest version boasts significant improvements to weatherproofing and manoeuvrability. You can see it zipping around Tokyo in the video below:\n\nThe most striking thing about the car (if you can call it that) is its size. At under 2.5 metres long and 1.4 metres high, it\u2019s significantly smaller than the average golf trolley.\n\nIt\u2019s also a lot more nimble, boasting the agility of a motorcycle. Speed and range are another matter, however \u2013 it maxes out at a decidedly sluggish 60km/h and can only reach around 50km between charges.\n\nDuring the 2019 Tokyo Motor Show, Business Insider Australia was invited to test-drive the latest iteration of the i-ROAD. Considering one of its key demographics are the elderly drivers, it was a surprisingly challenging experience.\n\nPhoto: Gizmodo Australia\n\nAs you\u2019d expect from a car that measures 234 x 87 x 145 cm, the i-ROAD is a snug fit. It reminded me of clambering into a Daytona USA arcade cabinet as a grown adult. (If you\u2019ve never done this, we can\u2019t be friends.)\n\nTo give you an idea of its size, up to four i-Roads can be parked in a single standard parking bay. While this is great for economic and creative parking, it\u2019s not so great if you happen to be taller and wider than the average person.\n\nPhoto: Gizmodo Australia\n\nOn the plus side, the doors have an extremely wide axis to ensure they don\u2019t get in the way while entering and exiting the vehicle, which is handy. It uses a full-size steering wheel but there\u2019s no handbrake \u2013 instead, a second foot brake locks the vehicle in place.\n\nSo what is the i-ROAD like to drive?\n\nThe three-wheel design initially takes some getting used to. Turning sharply caused the un-powered rear wheel to slide outward which in turn prompted me to overcompensate with my steering.\n\nThere\u2019s also the patented Active Lean technology to contend with. This calculates the required angle of lean, based on steering angle, vehicle speed and information from a gyro sensor. The end result is car that leans out of corners like an Olympic skier.\n\nToyota reckons this enhances the vehicle\u2019s \u201csense of fun\u201d but it can also make for a white-knuckled ride; especially on your first hard turn. I never thought I\u2019d say that about a tiny battery-operated car, but here we are.\n\nMind you, I tested the i-ROAD in a wet, rainy car park which surely didn\u2019t help with performance. In any event, it only took a handful of corners to get used to the unique way the car handles. (I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d ever want to take a corner at the maximum speed of 60 kilometres an hour though \u2013 I\u2019d be worried it would tip over.)\n\nThe Toyota i-RIDE is currently being trialed in several European and Asian countries. There\u2019s no word on whether we will ever see one in Australia.\n\nDespite the snug fit, I\u2019d love to have one for zipping around in. It would be especially handy for navigating the labyrinthine backstreets of Sydney and Melbourne. Here\u2019s hoping an enterprising car rental service arranges a fleet for Australia.\n\nThis story originally appeared on Gizmodo Australia.
