He left the field briefly for treatment and tests but didn\u2019t miss a play in Cleveland\u2019s 32-28 loss Sunday.\n\nThe Browns have a bye this week, giving Mayfield time to recover before Cleveland (2-4) visits New England on Oct. 27.\n\nMayfield took part in pre-practice stretching Tuesday but stood to the side holding his helmet while the other quarterbacks did passing drills.\n\nMayfield has struggled in his second season. He leads the NFL with 11 interceptions - the most in six games by a Browns quarterback since 1984.\n\nNot all the interceptions are his fault, but accuracy has been a problem all season for the former No. 1 overall pick.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield is limited in practice after injuring his left hip against Seattle.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Withers"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/seahawks_browns_football_28425_c71-0-3873-2218_s1200x700.jpg?6e8ace4e22a43c390c46fd88ac18529ee8be4ab4", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
