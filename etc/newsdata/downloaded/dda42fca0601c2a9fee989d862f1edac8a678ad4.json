It was only up for a few days. It\u2019s confusing.\u2019 Experts are divided on the issue. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said it was fine to feed small amounts of bread to ducks but they should also get sweetcorn, porridge oats, peas and bird seed.\n\nTony Whitehead, of the charity, said: \u2018Just like us, birds need a varied diet to stay healthy.\u2019\n\nThe Canal and River Trust has previously campaigned against feeding bread to ducks, saying: \u2018Uneaten soggy bread can cause a build-up of bad nutrients which can lead to greater algal growth, spread disease and encourage pests such as rats.\u2019\n\nBut Swan Support, which rescues swans, ducks and geese, said some were starving because people had stopped feeding them bread. It blamed a campaign called Ban the Bread by a company selling bird food.\n\nThe charity\u2019s Wendy Hermon said: \u2018Bread has been fed to swans, ducks and geese for hundreds of years. It\u2019s absolutely fine to feed bread.\u2019\n\nThe Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust said feeding birds a small amount of bread was safe as part of a varied diet that also included vegetables and grain.", "description": "A photo of a sign near at pond in Pavilion Gardens in Buxton, Derbyshire has fuelled a debate over whether or not it is okay to feed bread to ducks.
