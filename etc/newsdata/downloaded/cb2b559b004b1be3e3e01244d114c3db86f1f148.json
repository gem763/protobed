Choose Your (70-Something) Fighter.", "language": "en", "text": "The youths love Bernie Sanders. In poll after poll, the 78-year-old Vermont senator leads all other candidates for the Democratic Party presidential nomination among Millennials and Generation Z.\n\nThat a man born before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor is Millennials and Gen Z\u2019s preferred candidate might raise some eyebrows. It\u2019s natural to assume that generational change candidates are supposed to look like generational change. John F. Kennedy was just 43 when he declared at his 1961 inaugural that \u201cthe torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans, born in this century.\u201d And sure, generational politics is probably far too bourgeois of a concept for a democratic socialist seeking to build a cross-generational working-class movement to embrace.\n\nBut generational change doesn\u2019t have to come from a candidate of the rising younger generations. That\u2019s at least what the late political consultant Pat Caddell, the foremost advocate of generational politics, said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a terrible misconception about generational politics \u2015 that somehow people vote because somebody is a certain age,\u201d he said in 1988. Instead, the generational politics argument is that people vote for candidates based on \u201cshared values and shared experiences.\u201d\n\nMillennial politicians agree. \u201cGenerational change doesn\u2019t mean elect whoever is younger,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said on Thursday about her endorsement of Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) over his much younger primary challenger Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.).\n\nThat\u2019s the sort of thing that Sanders is selling. Two-thirds of his Facebook advertising targets voters under 44 years old \u2014 the highest percentage of any of the candidates, according to Facebook advertising data collected by the progressive digital firm Bully Pulpit Interactive. And the time is ripe. The first election in which candidates argued that Baby Boomers should be running the country happened in 1984, when the oldest Boomers were 38 years old. That\u2019s how old the oldest Millennials are today.\n\nThe Cycles of American History\n\nDiana Walker via Getty Images Pollster Pat Caddell in his office speaking re: \"debategate\" and holding Carter briefing book and materials from his 1980 campaign. (Photo by Diana Walker/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images)\n\nThe concept of the \u201cgeneration\u201d \u2015 a coherent age cohort with shared life experiences \u2015 was invented in the mid-19th century by European philosophers seeking a way to calculate the ebb and flow of historical change. It\u2019s a slippery concept that may or may not mean anything at all. But the obsession with generations found its way into American politics nonetheless.\n\nFranklin Roosevelt told the 1936 Democratic National Convention crowd that \u201cthis generation has a rendezvous with destiny.\u201d Teddy Roosevelt pushed for the Spanish-American War as a means to test the mettle of his generation in war. And, of course, there was Kennedy.\n\nBut it\u2019s Caddell who shapes our contemporary understanding of generational politics. After helping Jimmy Carter win the White House in 1976, Caddell decided that the fight over which party would win the votes of the rising Baby Boom generation would define the elections of the 1980s and the future of the country.\n\nCaddell\u2019s plan was to contrive a Kennedy replicant for Baby Boomers. This Camelot copy was based on a fictitious presidential candidate \u2014 Sen. Smith \u2014 Caddell tested to focus groups. Smith was a 40-something senator; a passionate idealist who echoed the liberal patriotism of President John Kennedy, but campaigned on \u201cnew ideas\u201d that would break with stodgy New Deal policies of the past.\n\nColorado Sen. Gary Hart, born in 1936 and not a Baby Boomer, was the first to don the Sen. Smith persona in 1984.\n\n\u201cThe fault line of the party is now between those who have been in office for 20 or 25 years and those who have come into office in the last 10 years and who are less tied to the arrangements dating to Roosevelt and Johnson,\u201d Hart said.\n\nHart barely lost the nomination to Walter Mondale and then fled the 1988 nomination fight after he was caught in an extramarital affair. Historian Arthur Schlesinger\u2019s \u201cThe Cycles of American History\u201d further popularized generational arguments in politics in 1986. And Caddell\u2019s faith in generational politics did not waver. He found a new candidate to don the Sen. Smith persona: the then-44-year-old Delaware Sen. Joe Biden.\n\nThe choice of Biden didn\u2019t come out of the blue. Biden had made the same generational argument for some time and was pursued by Caddell to be the generational candidate in 1984, but declined.\n\nBut Biden suffered from the same problems as Hart. Born in 1942, he wasn\u2019t technically a Baby Boomer and he didn\u2019t participate in the animating dramas of the 1960s \u2015 the protests, the sit-ins, the boycotts, the drugs \u2015 that Caddell thought united the Baby Boom generation. He clumsily oversold his connection to the protest movements of the \u201960s and then when he tried to pivot from the generational message to one aimed at working-class voters, he wound up plagiarizing a British politician\u2019s biography. He dropped out of the race and later said he regretted overselling his Boomer radical bona fides, noting that \u201cwasn\u2019t me.\u201d\n\nThe Baby Boom generation would have to wait for one of their own, Bill Clinton, to take generational control of the White House in 1992. Clinton\u2019s advisers repeatedly told the press that they did not believe in the promise of generational politics and weren\u2019t campaigning on it. That\u2019s because their candidate already embodied it. Unlike Hart and Biden, Clinton had protested, dodged the draft and smoked pot (but didn\u2019t inhale). The campaign anthem\u2019s chorus, Stevie Nicks singing, \u201cDon\u2019t stop thinking about tomorrow,\u201d said it all.\n\nBaby Boomers \u2015 Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump \u2015 have held the White House ever since. But neither party ever gained a hold on the generation. Its main unifying generational experience turned out to be division.\n\nShared Values\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Carly Hein of Omaha, Nebraska, talks on her cell phone as she waits for Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to arrive at a rally for Omaha Democratic mayoral candidate Heath Mello, Thursday, April 20, 2017.\n\nAs Baby Boomers sought generational change by moving away from the New Deal government intervention policies of their parents, Sanders remained linked to the old consensus. The values he espoused and the policies he pushed seemed out of tune as the Baby Boom generation came into power, but today politics has come back around to him.\n\nHis calls for single-payer health care, free college and student loan forgiveness have been embraced by many young voters who have grown up during the slow-motion collapse of the neoliberal economic order.\n\nMillennials came of age in an era of spiraling inequality, booming child care and housing costs, the rise of student loan debt and the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Where Baby Boomers\u2019 vision of societal collapse was New York City\u2019s near bankruptcy, Millennials saw their future prospects dimmed by an overcooked global financial system, the same one that seized power after President Gerald Ford told New York to drop dead. Americans born in the 1980s were 34 percent worse off economically than expected due to the financial crisis, according to a 2018 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden gets a hug from Ruth Nowadzky, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, during the Hawkeye Area Labor Council Labor Day Picnic, Monday, Sept. 2, 2019, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\n\nLike Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is in her 70s, but she missed the rightward economic shift of the Democratic Party in the late 20th century. Despite actually being a Baby Boomer, she also didn\u2019t have the experiences that Caddell thought defined their generation. Warren dropped out of college at 19 in 1968 to get married. She spent most of the 1970s working her way through college and then law school while raising her children. Warren\u2019s entrance into electoral politics in 2012 came in response to the financial crisis that has come to define Millennial life. She consistently polls second to Sanders among younger voters while maintaining equivalent support across all age groups.\n\nAnd although Sanders may be the generational change candidate for the youth, Biden, today 76 years old, represents a different kind of generational politics \u2015 that of the older generations. His perch atop the polls is buoyed by wide support from voters over the age of 65, but limited support from the young. Thirty-five percent of his campaign\u2019s Facebook advertising targets over-65 voters \u2015 the most of any candidate \u2015 while only 16 percent targets voters under 45.\n\nOnce the avatar of generational change, today Biden says he was called to run again to put away the demons the Baby Boom generation he identifies with thought they had defeated in their youth. The \u201ccontorted faces\u201d of torch-bearing neo-Nazis marching in Charlottesville, an echo of the Ku Klux Klan of the 1960s, Biden said, forced him to run for president.\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d see something like that again in my life,\u201d he declared.\n\nNotice that word, \u201cagain.\u201d For a generation whose narrative involves successfully marching to end Jim Crow and pass civil and voting rights and fair housing legislation, the sight of the old evils \u2015 fueled by the rhetoric of a Baby Boomer president, no less \u2015 is a call to action.\n\nThis is no time to \u201cpass the torch,\u201d as Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a Millennial who briefly ran for president, suggested Biden do. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m not passing the torch is because I don\u2019t want them to burn their hands,\u201d Biden said at a fundraiser on Thursday.\n\nAs Bob Dole ran his 1996 presidential campaign as the last fight of the G.I. Generation, Biden\u2019s is billed as the last march \u2014 the last protest \u2014 of his own.\n\nMatt Fuller contributed reporting.", "description": "\"There's a terrible misconception about generational politics \u2014 that somehow people vote because somebody is a certain age,\" late political consultant Pa...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d83d0ed240000d3267ece8f.jpeg?cache=mmtcyb0m0p&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
