(BA) in terms of deliveries as its U.S. rival still struggles with the world-wide grounding of the 737 MAX following two fatal crashes and the halt in the plane deliveries.\n\nAirbus also cut its 2019 target for free cash flow before mergers and acquisitions and customer financing to EUR3 billion from a previous outlook of EUR4 billion after booking minus EUR5.13 billion in FCF for the first nine months of the year. The company typically generates most of its free cash flow during the last quarter as it recovers from delayed plane handovers.\n\n\"We are focused on the A320neo ramp-up and improving the industrial flow while managing the higher level of complexity on the A321 ACF in particular,\" Airbus's Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said.\n\nWrite to Olivia Bugault at olivia.bugault@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 02:26 ET (06:26 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
