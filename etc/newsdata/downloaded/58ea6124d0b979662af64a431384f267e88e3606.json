Most of which served to demonstrate a simple unyielding truth: contrary to Boris Johnson\u2019s bemusing claim that they are the \u201cparty of the NHS\u201d, the party clearly doesn\u2019t understand how and why the NHS survives and continues to be the jewel in the crown of British achievement.\n\nFrom the flagship pledge of building 40 new hospitals (in reality, six hospitals) to the inflammatory rhetoric of Priti Patel\u2019s gleeful anti-immigrant antipathy, the evidence demonstrates a pernicious misunderstanding of some of the basic truths about the NHS:\n\nFirstly, the NHS survives because of its staff \u2013 of which there currently are too few. And secondly, the NHS has thrived because of immigrants, with frontline staff from 212 nationalities consistently working harder and longer considering the salaries they are paid .\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Instead we will introduce an Australian style points-based immigration system. One that attracts the brightest and best. This daughter of immigrants needs no lectures from the north London, metropolitan, liberal elite.\u201d\n\nIt beggars belief that such statements are so replete with inaccuracy. Under Johnson, the government claims the elixir to the UK\u2019s immigration issues is the points-based Australian immigration system. However, the UK\u2019s immigration system is essentially already a points-based system and still fails to gauge healthcare staffing needs. The country is littered with examples, such as the case of Dr Mu Chun-Chiang \u2013 a doctor who has lived the majority of her life in the UK, working on an understaffed ward, yet is due to deported by the Home Office, despite the ongoing and public medical shortage \u2013 fulfilling the criteria of any points-based system. Her decision was overturned only after public outcry. In addition to her case, there are the many European doctors being refused settled status, even in shortage areas and specialties, as well as cases from outside the EU such as Luke Ong and a number of others who were told to leave despite their public service.\n\nEven those born and educated in the UK, such as myself, have not been exempt from this xenophobic lunacy. Meanwhile, the actual Australian points-based system has failed to address a crippling nursing shortage in Australia.\n\nIt seems that Johnson and Patel have not done their basic research into their immigration panacea, instead allowing the Home Office to deny visas to the brightest and best, but most importantly the needed.\n\nThe foundation of the mis-directed immigration policy has origins in policy from Johnson\u2019s old Etonian adversary, David Cameron. Cameron claimed that one just had to \u201clook at the crowded doctors\u2019 waiting rooms,\u201d to see the problems with the NHS and immigration. As a doctor with a waiting room, such a statement from a former PM betrays the degree of prejudice among politicians who wish to claim liberal legacies.\n\nThe evidence also runs counter to this narrative \u2013 a study conducted by Oxford University looked at 125 million patient records and found that a 10 percentage point increase in migrants leads to reduced waiting times of nine days for outpatient referrals, with no effect on waits for A&E or elective care. In the light of such a study, it\u2019s important to remember that the same ignorance of evidence spawned the Hostile Environment. It was a policy borne out of Cameron\u2019s decision to appeal to xenophobia, and Theresa May\u2019s zeal to implement it. It represents their true legacy and Patel, in her eagerness to please her political party, is clearly more than happy to champion it.\n\nJohnson\u2019s aforementioned plans to build \u201c40 new hospitals\u201d is an extension of the Conservative Party\u2019s ignorance over the NHS. Johnson and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, initially doubled-down on this number, and then rapidly changed tack, admitting to funding for only six. In many ways, approaches like these typify political thinking on the NHS: promise new shiny hospitals to the public in the hope that they\u2019ll be distracted, while ignoring fundamental problems and failing to acknowledge any role in creating them. Chris Hopson (CEO of NHS providers and often a voice of reason on such NHS pronouncements), helpfully delineated the problems faced by NHS trusts with regards to their infrastructure. His words state the issue better than I can: \u201cThe NHS has been starved of capital since 2010. There's a \u00a36 billion maintenance backlog, \u00a33 billion of it is safety critical. It's not just these six hospitals who have crumbling, outdated infrastructure.\u201d\n\nFurther, under such proposals, what comfort would I, a surgeon, take from walking into a new, bright and shiny operating theatre with no anaesthetist, ODP, scrub nurse, theatre runner or surgical assistant available to actually help the patient?\n\nSafe-staffing levels are not just about media sound bites. They are a fundamental part of patient safety \u2013 as stated by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, the Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College of Physicians among many others.\n\nAnd the solution to the problem of low levels of safe staffing is the same as it always has been for the NHS \u2013 the need for immigrant labour. From the Windrush generation, to the South Asian doctors and nurses of the 60s and 70s and to the currently 13.1 per cent of NHS staff being of a non-british nationality \u2013 without immigrant labour, the NHS will wither and die.\n\nEven Enoch \u201cRivers of Blood\u201d Powell recognised this basic truth during his time in government, yet our last three prime ministers have routinely refused to. If Johnson truly wants to help our NHS, he needs to look at investing in people rather than just the buildings. As for Patel \u2013 as a fellow child of immigrants \u2013 I would humbly suggest that she look at the evidence rather than pandering to base xenophobic illogical instincts for precarious career advancement.", "description": "We\u2019ve witnessed a slew of pronouncements from the Conservative Party in the last week.", "authors": ["Dolin Bhagawati"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/05/11/boris-johnson-priti-patel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
