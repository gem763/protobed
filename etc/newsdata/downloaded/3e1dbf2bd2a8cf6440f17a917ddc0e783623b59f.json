Dealing with the suits against the family would take time and attention of company officials away from the settlement, the filing argues.\n\nThe settlement deal calls for the Sackler family to hand over the company to trustees who would run it, with profits going into the settlement. The family would also sell its international drug companies and contribute between $3 billion and $4.5 billion to the settlement over time, depending on the sale price. Overall, the settlement could be worth up to $12 billion, though critics believe it won\u2019t come close to that.\n\nTwenty-four states have not agreed to the tentative deal. The attorneys general in many of the states say they don\u2019t want to give up their claims against Sackler family members, as would be required to settle.\n\nBut another 24 have agreed, as have lawyers on a committee representing local and tribal governments as well as unions, hospitals and others suing the company have also agreed.\n\nThe deal does not apply to Kentucky and Oklahoma, which have reached their own settlements with Purdue.\n\n___\n\nFollow Geoff Mulvihill at http://www.twitter.com/geoffmulvihill\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma on Wednesday asked a bankruptcy court judge to halt all lawsuits against the company and its former directors, including members of the Sackler family, which owns the company.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Geoff Mulvihill"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/opioid_crisis_purdue_bankruptcy_73962_c0-0-3000-1749_s1770x1032.jpg?4ec8ef4b5df28140b7ab4a06fbd1165bdd086b07", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
