California is one of the biggest prizes, offering nearly 500 delegates in the Democratic nominating contest.\n\nIndependent voters, known in the state as \u201cno party preference,\u201d make up roughly 28% of registered California voters. But experts predict they\u2019ll make up just 15% of the Democratic primary electorate because of extra steps they need to take to get a presidential ballot, said Paul Mitchell, who runs the nonpartisan firm Political Data, Inc., which gathers and sells voter data. Rather than skewing more moderate, the independents who will vote in the Democratic contest are likely to be young, more diverse and more progressive than the rest of the electorate, he said.\n\nIn state primaries, California puts all candidates on the same ballot regardless of party, and the two candidates that receive the highest vote totals move onto the general election. All voters use the same ballot regardless of party registration.\n\nBut the presidential primary doesn\u2019t work that way. Independent voters will need to specifically ask for a Democratic ballot at the polls or by mail ahead of the primary.\n\n\u201cThose hurdles seem to be enough to kind of slow down the pace of (no party preference voters),\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cPeople believe that they can freely vote in these primaries because that\u2019s how you do it for everything else.\u201d\n\nThe independent voters that do vote, he said, are likely to be younger, more diverse and more progressive than the typical Democratic electorate. That bucks conventional wisdom that no party preference voters are more moderate. Instead, more young people and minorities who dislike the traditional parties are registering without one, he said.\n\nOn the Republican side, it\u2019s unclear if President Donald Trump will even be on the ballot. State lawmakers passed a law barring candidates from participating in the state\u2019s primary if they do not release their tax returns. A federal court has blocked the law at the Trump campaign\u2019s request, but the state is appealing.\n\nThe Libertarian and American Independent parties will also allow voters not affiliated with a party to vote in their primaries. The American Independent Party is a far-right conservative party, but its name can confuse voters who think they are registering without a party.\n\nThe Green and Peace and Freedom parties will not allow independents to vote in their contests.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "California's more than 5.6 million independent voters will be allowed to vote in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, but not in the Republican contest, Secretary of State Alex Padilla announced Monday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/01/28/california_felon_voting_53652_c0-187-3000-1937_s1200x700.jpg?fc08441cf7ecb01730819faa0461971aad72d42e", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
