Four days later, police arrested a 36-year-old man for allegedly setting the fire that destroyed the oldest modern orthodox synagogue in northern Minnesota.\n\nMatthew J. Amiot was booked on first-degree arson Friday after allegedly setting the historic house of worship ablaze. No one was inside at the time, though six Torah scrolls \u2014 sacred Jewish texts handwritten on parchment paper \u2014 were destroyed.\n\nAt a Sunday news conference, Police Chief Mike Tusken said, \u201cThere is no reason to believe this is a bias or hate crime\u201d at this time. Authorities have not determined the motive.\n\nAccording to Duluth Fire Chief Shawn Krizaj, firefighters responded to the Adas Israel Congregation at 2:30 a.m. Monday. Krizaj explained at the news conference that the fire initiated outside the building but \u201cquickly spread through voids in the wall space and spread throughout the synagogue.\u201d\n\nThe structure was consumed by flames until dawn, when it collapsed. It took five hours of hosing down the building before the fire subsided, leaving behind charred debris in what Duluth Assistant Fire Chief Brent Consie called \u201cpretty much a total loss.\u201d\n\n\n\nFirefighters battle a blaze at the Adas Israel Congregation in Duluth, Minn. (Dan Kraker/AP)\n\nLocal police and fire departments and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have collaborated since Monday to determine the fire\u2019s cause. The investigation is still ongoing.\n\nRabbi Phillip Sher, who leads the Adas Israel Congregation, called the firefighters \u201cheroic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey went into a building that was still burning to save some of our artifacts,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bravery of these men is just incredible.\u201d\n\nPolice said they arrested Amiot on Friday but postponed until Sunday a news conference so the Jewish community could observe the Sabbath.\n\nAt the news conference, Amiot, who is not Jewish, was unknown to the Adas Israel Congregation. He is being held in the St. Louis County jail and will appear at court in Duluth on Monday.\n\nThe Adas Israel Congregation, built in 1901 and founded by Lithuanian Jewish immigrants, held 40 families or approximately 75 members.\n\nOn Sunday, Sher said he was consoling and reassuring his members, noting that \u201ctrue Judaism is in the heart, not in the building.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nWhy the N.Y.
