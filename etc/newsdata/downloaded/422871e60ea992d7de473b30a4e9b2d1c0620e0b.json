Both teams\u2019 stadiums are situated near Green Line stations.\n\n\u201cMetro is prepared to accommodate fans by running additional trains on the Green Line, both before and after the games, as we always do,\u201d Metro\u2019s statement said. \u201cWhile there has been no formal request to extend Metrorail service, we want to assure fans considering choosing Metro that we will get you home if the game runs later than expected. Trains will continue running at least 20 minutes after the end of the game, up to one hour later than our normal closing time, if necessary.\n\n\u201cWhile this announcement addresses the immediate concern around Tuesday\u2019s games, the Metro Board will take up the broader issues concerning Metro\u2019s closing time and accommodating fans during playoff season in the coming months.\u201d\n\nThis seemed to reverse a previous statement tweeted by Metrorail hours earlier, which said that Metro would operate on a normal weekday schedule and close at 11:30 p.m.\n\nGood afternoon. Tuesday 10/1, Metro will be operating on a normal rail schedule 5 am- 11:30 pm. You can view last train times departing from the Navy Yard station below. -KAhttps://t.co/yPoZNIxpxF \u2014 Metrorail Info (@Metrorailinfo) September 30, 2019\n\nThat tweet drew the ire of some fans who complained that Metro would not help the thousands of fans expected to be out on the town late attending these playoff games.\n\nMetro has kept trains running late for Nationals playoff games in the past, most recently in 2017. Trains also operated for extended hours for home games during the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs, when the Washington Capitals won the Cup.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
