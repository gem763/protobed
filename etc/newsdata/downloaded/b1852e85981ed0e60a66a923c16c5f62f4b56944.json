The Detroit automaker made $2.35 billion, or $1.60 per share, but the strike cost it 52 cents per share of earnings.\n\nMost of the impact from the 40-day strike will hit in the fourth quarter. GM said the strike will wind up costing it $2.86 billion in net income for the year. That forced the company to cut its full-year pretax profit guidance from $6.50 to $7 per share, to $4.50 to $4.80.\n\nExcluding one-time restructuring costs, the company made $1.72 per share, beating Wall Street estimates of $1.38, according to data provider FactSet. Revenue fell 0.9% to $35.5 billion, but still surpassed analyst estimates of roughly $35 billion.\n\nGM shares rose 1.6% to $37.22 in pre-trade. The stock is down 6% on the year.\n\nGM strike: Workers reach tentative deal with General Motors\n\nWorkers, who ended their strike on Friday, were able to win a mix of pay raises and lump sums. They also got an $11,000-per-worker signing bonus, faster pay raises for newly hired employees and a path to full-time work for temporary workers. They kept their current top-notch health insurance with workers picking up only a 3% of the cost.\n\nBut GM won significant cost savings because it was able to close three underused factories that made cars and transmissions. The company is closing factories in Lordstown, Ohio; Warren, Michigan; and near Baltimore.\n\nGM's profit declined even though sales jumped 6.3% in the U.S., the company's most profitable market. The average sales price rose 2.8% to $41,661 per vehicle compared with a year ago, according to the Edmunds.com auto pricing site. Edmunds provides content to The Associated Press.\n\n\"Despite the strike, GM had a lot working to the company's advantage in the third quarter,\" said Jeremy Acevedo, senior manager of insights, said in a statement. The company, he said, is showing benefits of shedding slow-selling cars from its lineup, and production of new full-size pickup trucks are getting up to speed.\n\nLight trucks accounted for just over 88% of GM's sales during the third quarter, and truck sales rose during the quarter for the first time. GM has been switching factories over to the new truck through the year, a process that was halted by the strike.", "description": "Labor action will slice automaker's profits for the year, though latest earnings top analyst forecasts", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/05/763c3ed5-c0cd-45e5-9db4-c6ac004040db/thumbnail/1200x630/cce7d755f85a74a1aa352f7d5a75439b/103420036.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
