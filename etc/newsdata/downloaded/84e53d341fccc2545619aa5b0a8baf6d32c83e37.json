And where there are the occasional lighthearted high jinks, the second \u201cMaleficent\u201d (\u2605\u2605\u2605 out of four; rated PG; in theaters nationwide Friday) harbors a surprisingly stygian side just as dark as its title antiheroine\u2019s horns of plenty.\n\nThe new movie picks up five years after the 2014 live-action adaptation when Maleficent, reformed villain and protector of the magical Moors, saved the day and embraced her role as godmother to Princess Aurora (Elle Fanning).\n\n'Maleficent': Angelina Jolie's kids steal the show at 'Mistress of Evil' premiere\n\nRanked: All the Disney live-action remakes (including 'Maleficent')\n\nSince then, Aurora has been installed as queen of the Moors, where her \u201cpeople\u201d are legions of fairies and large tree dudes, and she gets an exciting wedding proposal from boyfriend Phillip (Harris Dickinson), prince of the neighboring kingdom of Ulstead. Maleficent is displeased with the news \u2013 not only is she not a big fan of humankind in general, but she\u2019s very protective of Aurora.\n\nMaleficent (Angelina Jolie, left) lets loose some dark magic in the presence of adopted daughter Aurora (Elle Fanning) in \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.\" (Photo: DISNEY)\n\nStill, because she loves her adopted daughter, Maleficent accepts an invite to a royal meet-the-parents shindig and even wears a shawl to hide her horns. Phillip\u2019s dad King John (Robert Lindsay) is all about brokering peace between the Moors and Ulstead, though not his wife Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer), the kind of ice queen who doesn\u2019t let anything go.\n\nChilly zingers and side-eye daggers are unleashed by the two forceful moms, the dinner party turns disastrous when the king gets mysteriously cursed, Aurora sides with Phillip\u2019s parents, and Maleficent flies off only to be wounded by Ingrith\u2019s sinister little henchwoman Gerda (Jenn Murray). Ingrith sets her megalomaniacal plans in motion, while Maleficent is nursed back to health by a legion of Dark Fey just like her who hide from mankind.\n\nJolie\u2019s magnetism, plus the way she toes the line between being a fairy version of Batman and a menacing mistress of not-quite-evil-but-pretty-close, is why these \u201cMaleficent\u201d movies work. She fits the character as well as her endless cycle of evolving costumes.\n\nPrince Phillip (Harris Dickinson, left) introduces his fiancee Aurora (Elle Fanning) to dad King John (Robert Lindsay) and Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer) in \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.\" (Photo: JAAP BUITENDIJK)\n\nAnd she gets quite the foil in Pfeiffer\u2019s Ingrith: Her badness is very on the nose \u2013 she snaps a mannequin\u2019s neck sideways to enter her secret hidden hair \u2013 yet it\u2019s fun to see the two A-list actresses chowing down on fantasy scenery. Jolie\u2019s character even fluffs her wings like a peacock in an effort to be the alpha female.\n\nThe movie overall could use more subtlety, from the dialogue (\u201csleeping beauty\u201d is a phrase used more than once) to the emphasis on intolerance (Ulsteadians bring pitchforks to greet magical folks) to a definite in-your-face darkness. True, the first \"Maleficent\" had its lead character's wings horrifyingly ripped off, but \u201cMistress of Evil\u201d hinges on a genocidal plot to murder any and all fairy creatures, which might not be totally kosher for some little kids.\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor plays the winged dark fey Conall in \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.\" (Photo: DISNEY)\n\nDirector Joachim Ronning (\u201cPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\u201d) does a good job crafting an expansive magical world, adding to it the wondrous underground caves and land of the Dark Fey. Maleficent learns more of her origins among her people \u2013 who mainly look like hot models in wings and war paint \u2013 while having her own conflicted feelings reflected in a couple of Dark Fey dudes, the battle-ready Borra (Ed Skrein) and the thoughtful Conall (Chiwetel Ejiofor).\n\nWhile it can\u2019t escape some of the inherent tropes, \u201cMistress of Evil\u201d ventures past the usual \u201chappily ever after\u201d rigmarole to craft a tale of parents and kids thematically similar to those Disney Channel \u201cDescendants\u201d teen movies: There\u2019s a fine line between hero and villain, and it\u2019s OK to be a little bad sometimes.\n\nJust don\u2019t be an evil queen, which is a life lesson for us all.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/15/maleficent-mistress-of-evil-review-angelina-jolie/3982834002/", "description": "Disney sequel 'Maleficent: Mistress of Evil' reimagines 'Sleeping Beauty' with a darker side and Angelina Jolie vs. Michelle Pfeiffer in a mom fight.", "authors": ["Brian Truitt", "Published A.M.
