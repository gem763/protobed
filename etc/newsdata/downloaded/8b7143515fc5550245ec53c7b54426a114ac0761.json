However, we all knew that no one could stay with the company for 102 years. A sustainable Alibaba would have to be built on sound governance, culture-centric philosophy, and consistency in developing talent. No company can rely solely on its founders.\"\n\nMa had previously scaled down his role in Alibaba by stepping down as CEO in 2013, staying with the conglomerate in the capacity of executive chairman to develop strategies and talent, as well as work on its \"social responsibilities\" efforts.\n\nMa, China's richest man, founded Alibaba in 1999 out of his apartment in Hangzhou. It has since become one of the biggest retailers in the world.\n\n\"The one thing I can promise everyone is this: Alibaba was never about Jack Ma, but Jack Ma will forever belong to Alibaba,\" Ma said, signing off his letter.\n\nThe company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014 and is the world's biggest ecommerce company by total value of the merchandise sold across its platforms, which include TMall and Taobao, China's largest online marketplace.\n\nAlongside home-grown internet giants Baidu and Tencent, the company has transformed the Chinese retail landscape in the past decade.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nAlibaba retirement plan a decade in the making: Jack Ma\n\nThe boss of Chinese largest e-commerce operator announced earlier this month that he will step down in 2019.\n\nBusiness as usual for Alibaba despite US-China trade war\n\nThe company remains focused on security compliance and growth.\n\nAlibaba Cloud sales up 66% in Q1, hits $4.5 billion annual revenue run rate\n\nAlibaba Cloud turned in another strong quarter as the e-commerce giant showed no slowdown.\n\nThe technology enabling Alibaba to sell $30.8 billion in Double 11 goods\n\nFrom artificial intelligence to datacentre cooling, machine learning, and blockchain, Alibaba used new technology to surpass its record 11.11 Global Shopping Festival sales figure set last year by 45.3 billion yuan.", "description": "A succession plan that has been a year in the making, the billionaire co-founder of China's ecommerce giant Alibaba has officially handed his company over.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/11/10/1829b433-9264-4b40-8dbe-aab094b73106/thumbnail/770x578/18aff6914951d2b8187b7e1586f2effb/jack-ma-november-11-2016.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
