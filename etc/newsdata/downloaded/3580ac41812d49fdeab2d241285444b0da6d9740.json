These workers have a surprising answer", "language": "en", "text": "Everybody hates the idea of being laid off \u2014 but if it has to happen, many workers say they would prefer if a robot took their place.\n\nThe Brookings Institution estimates that 36 million Americans are working jobs with a \u201chigh exposure\u201d to automation, meaning a machine could handle at least 70% of the job. Food service, short-haul transportation and clerical office work are some of the jobs at risk.\n\nLast month, Amazon said it would spend $700 million to retrain one-third of its American workforce, about 100,000 people, by 2025. The online retail giant says it\u2019s a serious investment in its workforce, but labor-union critics contend that Amazon AMZN, +0.97% \u201cwants to automate every good job out of existence.\u201d\n\n60% of participants said they\u2019d prefer to be replaced by a robot, not a human.\n\nA study released this week of 2,000 people by researchers at the Technical University of Munich and Erasmus University in Rotterdam is putting a twist on people\u2019s fears of automation that are creeping into the workplace. When participants were asked if they wanted a human or a robot to take their job, 60% of participants said they\u2019d actually prefer to be replaced by a robot instead of a human being. In fact, they felt the same way about being replaced by artificial intelligence.\n\nYet another part of the study gauged reactions to a theoretical firm that needed to cut costs either with replacement employees or robots, and 67% opted for new employees. They want people to have jobs \u2014 just not if one of them is filling their role if they get fired.\n\nThe researchers have a simple explanation: ego.\n\n\u2018We just have this egocentric viewpoint that I\u2019m irreplaceable.\u2019 \u2014Daren Martin, CEO and founder of the Global Company Culture Association\n\nDaren Martin, chief executive and founder of the Global Company Culture Association, a company bringing together business leaders to focus on workplace culture, told MarketWatch he wasn\u2019t surprised. The study might be grappling with new questions about automation, but the results revealed a \u201cbasic human character,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe just have this egocentric viewpoint that \u2018I\u2019m irreplaceable,\u2019\u201d which leads people to think if something will take over, it would have to be a machine instead of a person, said Martin.\n\nMartin, who is also an executive coach, will ask businesspeople to rate their performance and then rate their colleagues\u2019 work. Around 95% of the time, people will rate themselves higher than their colleagues, he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: How AI is catching people who cheat on their diets, job searches and college work\n\nAutomation won\u2019t be \u201ca sudden robot takeover but a period of ongoing and, perhaps, accelerated change in how work is organized and the mix of jobs in the economy,\u201d according to a McKinsey & Company report last month. Even if some jobs disappear, the consulting firm said new jobs will appear for workers who can adapt.\n\nA worker\u2019s high-tech transformation may not be drama-free. In June, 43% of managers told the global staffing agency Robert Half International RHI, -0.74% that worker resistance to change is the top barrier to adapting new technologies.\n\nOther researchers have been exploring how humans feel about vying with robots \u2014 and those results might contradict the conclusions that people can brush off losing to an advanced-technology adversary.\n\nOne recent Cornell University experiment, for example, pitted robots against humans in games for cash prizes. The humans stopped trying hard and grew to dislike the machine that kept on winning.\n\n\u201cI felt very stressed competing with the robot,\u201d said one participant. \u201cIn some rounds, I kept seeing the robot\u2019s score increasing out of the corner of my eye, which was extremely nerve-racking.\u201d", "description": "The Brookings Institution estimate that 36 million Americans are working jobs with a \u201chigh exposure\u201d to automation.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP325_robots_ZG_20190813113537.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-13"}
