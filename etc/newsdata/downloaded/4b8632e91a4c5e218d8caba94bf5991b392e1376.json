The wait is over.\n\nFive years after first playing American football, the defensive lineman will play for the Carolina Panthers at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nThe 27-year-old has been overwhelmed by the attention surrounding his return to London as he takes the next step from astonishing backstory to a versatile NFL player.\n\nEfe Obada, who is a BIGKID ambassador, visited NikeTown on Friday on his return to London\n\nObada looked happy to be back in England ahead of Sunday's clash at Tottenham's stadium\n\nObada is still getting used to the intricacies of a complicated sport, but a combination of a good woman, his fierce work ethic and solid team-mates have put him in good stead.\n\nAlthough the latter have a habit of mentioning the London thing\u2026\n\n\u2018Everyone wanted to know where to eat, where to go. What to do. Putting on their best English accent. Trying to mimic it. \u201cWhat words shall I say?\u201d, all that stuff. The guys sense my vibe and know that I\u2019m getting a bit fed up with it,\u2019 Obada tells Sportsmail.\n\nIt\u2019s not that he\u2019s not excited. It\u2019s more that he\u2019s focused on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the task in hand.\n\nAfter finally landing with his team on Thursday morning \u2013 Obada has been all too aware of this trip since April - the visit is strictly business.\n\n\u2018I was overwhelmed with everything that was going on. It\u2019s not me coming back in the offseason, it\u2019s me coming back during the season. It\u2019s a different vibe. And I don\u2019t want to annoy any coaches and not be focused. This moment doesn\u2019t come very often, I want to be focused,\u2019 he says.\n\nObada, pictured in March, has a remarkable backstory and continues his sporting journey\n\nObada has found a home in Carolina and is a versatile piece in their defensive scheme\n\nObada\u2019s remarkable backstory is well-told but nevertheless worth repeating.\n\nTrafficked to England from his native Nigeria via Holland at the age of ten, he survived on London\u2019s streets with his older sister, eventually moving from foster home to foster home.\n\nHe dodged the capital\u2019s gang culture and while working unpacking boxes in a Welwyn Garden City factory took up American football with the London Warriors after a chance meeting with a friend.\n\nHe has barely looked back since.\n\nAfter stints with the Dallas Cowboys, Kansas City Chiefs and Atlanta Falcons, Obada landed in Carolina and became the first member of the NFL\u2019s International Pathway Player Programme to make a team\u2019s 53-man roster.\n\nLast season he turned heads against the Cincinnati Bengals with a dream debut. After a sack and an interception, he was named NFC defensive player of the week.\n\nHe signed a one-year, $570,000 (\u00a3450,000) deal for the Panthers in January and continued to learn his craft, his dedication earning him the respect of coaches and team-mates.\n\nObada praised Panthers team-mate Christian McCaffrey, calling him an 'absolute beast'\n\nThe Panthers moved from a 4-3 base defense to a 3-4 in the offseason, meaning Obada had to learn a new role, moving from defensive end in a front four to a moveable piece in a front three.\n\n\u2018At first I was a bit hesitant. I didn\u2019t think I would fit in. I didn\u2019t know where my role would be. A new system, never played it before. I had to put on a lot of weight because I was going to go inside.\n\n\u2018I was used to being on the end even though I hadn\u2019t mastered the end yet - and now you want me to go inside and learn a whole different thing? But it worked out in my favour. I think I\u2019m doing a pretty good job. I\u2019m versatile. If anything I think it helped my stock.\n\n\u2018I played some nose. I played some tackle, I played from outside. I think I\u2019m just a jack of all trades, really and I think they trust me to put me into any position.\u2019\n\nPanthers head coach Ron Rivera was behind the move and Obada says his door is always open.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s definitely welcoming. The other day, playing inside I just felt that I haven\u2019t had the production that I wanted in terms of sacks. I went up to him to ask if I was doing the right things, or if there\u2019s anything else I need to work on.\n\n\u2018He said I was doing good. I\u2019m taking on the doubles and that frees up opportunities for the other guys. So keep staying the course.\u2019 Obada, who is listed as 265lbs (18st 9lbs) in team literature, has had to put on weight for his new role.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve put on 20lbs of muscle. That\u2019s weights, diet and a good woman! I\u2019m constantly eating. My wife cooks a lot, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen my Instagram. She looks after me!\u2019\n\nCarolina are 3-2, in part thanks to the form of running back Christian McCaffrey. His 866 yards from scrimmage and five touchdowns (four rushing) have put him firmly in the conversation for MVP.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s an absolute beast. Call it how it is! He\u2019s a monster. He\u2019s a pro,\u2019 Obada roars.\n\n\u2018I see the way he carries himself on and off the field. And I see the amount of time and money he invests in himself. It\u2019s inspiring.\u2019\n\nObada signed a one-year deal with Carolina in January as he familiarises himself with the sport\n\nThe 6ft 6in Obada is not permitted to tackle what he calls the team\u2019s \u2018golden goose\u2019 in team practices.\n\n\u2018You see why now,\u2019 Obada says. \u2018I\u2019ll be back here without the team if I tackled him!\u2019\n\nAnd what of today\u2019s game against their NFC South rivals? The Bucs (2-3) won 20-14 in week two, but Carolina (3-2) have found their feet since, winning their last three games.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re trying to just ride that momentum. We lost to them at home in Charlotte. This is a big one, it\u2019s kind of a revenge type game. It\u2019s kind of a grudge match,\u2019 Obada says. The Panthers return to Carolina immediately after the game ahead of their bye week. Will Obada be sticking around in London?\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll fly back with the team. I\u2019m here for business,\u2019 he says.", "description": "Efe Obada has been hearing all about this day for a while now.
