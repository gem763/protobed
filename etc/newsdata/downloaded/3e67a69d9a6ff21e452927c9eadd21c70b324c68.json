Tiffany Roubert\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how high that cliff is, but one slip of your boot, no matter how slight, and both of you will be at the bottom of it,\u201d said one commenter; another called the stunt \u201cJust stupid beyond belief\u201d.\n\nSome detractors highlighted that posting shots that appeared dangerous, even if they were not, could inspire copycats to risk their lives.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you played with perspective and it wasn\u2019t dangerous for you. You really don\u2019t understand the power you hold, do you? Saying we all have personal responsibility is just a conscience-salving tool.\n\n\u201cYou will encourage others who DON\u2019T know how to play with perspective, and someone will kill themselves by accident trying to emulate you.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an influencer. You influence. The clue is in the title.\n\n\u201cBe inspirational by all means, but stop ratcheting up this pseudo-dangerous vibe before you encourage someone to kill themselves.\u201d\n\nThe couple has defended the shot, telling Business Insider that \u201cit was quite easy, considering we didn\u2019t find this to be dangerous\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs we have discussed before, we love to push our creativity and play with perspectives. It is not dangerous. We would never risk our lives.\u201c\n\nIt follows them hitting headlines earlier this year for a similarly controversial snap in which Workman is holding Castille over the side of an infinity pool in Ubud, Bali, while they kiss, with a sheer drop below.\n\nThe photo was branded \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cstupid\u201d by online commenters.\n\nAt the time they fought back at critics, saying that they \u201cweren\u2019t going to feed into the negativity of this\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur account is about creativity, photography, kindness, perspective, and above all\u2026positivity,\u201d they added. \u201cWhether a photo does well or not, whether it is perceived one way or another, is irrelevant to us.\n\n\u201cWe post what we love and what we believe showcases our happiness, our adventures, (and) our creativity.\n\n\u201cThis has become a bigger deal than we could have ever imagined and we, going forward only wish to discuss positive things and the reality behind the photo.\u201d", "description": "A travel influencer couple have come under fire for posting a \u201cdangerous\u201d picture of themselves posing over a cliff edge \u2013 and not for the first time.", "authors": ["Helen Coffey"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/10/travel-influencer-dangerous.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
