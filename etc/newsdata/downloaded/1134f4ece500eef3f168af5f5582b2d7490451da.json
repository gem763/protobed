After a week of assessments, we sat down with professionals and they found my personality was more inclined to analysing quantity, which was not far off from my second option of accountancy.\n\n\u201cFrom then on I knew what to work towards academically,\u201d she says.\n\nMbutuma\u2019s numerical literacy at school was a good springboard for her as she met the requirements for entry into the quantity surveyor programmme at Durban\u2019s ML Sultan Technikon.\n\nI remember in my first class, I could not switch on a computer, so I raised my hand and said my computer was not working.\n\nSadly, it lasted only a year because she was physically abused by a fellow student.\n\n\u201cI did my first year there but I was manhandled and physically abused by a male student. My parents took a decision to look for an institution that was more likely to offer protection,\u201d she says.\n\nIt was then that she enrolled at the Wits Technikon (now the University of Johannesburg\u2019s Doornfontein campus) to do her first year again.\n\n\u201cThe high number of dropouts is partly because pupils have a certain picture of what the career should be, but when they get to varsity they\u2019re shocked. And at that point you are already in a new environment. I remember in my first class, I could not switch on a computer, so I raised my hand and said my computer was not working. The lecturer had to switch it on because I was too embarrassed to say I didn\u2019t know how to,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter completing her diploma, she obtained her bachelor of technology degree before beginning her working career as a junior quantity surveyor at BTKM \u2013Bham Tayob Khan and Masunda \u2013 in 2001.\n\nMore than three years after she joined BTKM, she tried her hand at being a quantity surveyor in the construction sector, but that was short-lived.\n\n\u201cMy training was as a consulting quantity surveyor, so when I tried my hand at actually being a non-consulting surveyor at a construction firm I didn\u2019t last six months,\u201d she says.\n\nMbutuma went back to consulting and landed a job at Total Facilities Management Company (TFMC) (now known as Bidvest Facilities Management) which, at the time, was managing Telkom properties.\n\nAfter almost three years at the company, Mbutuma was made head of the quantity surveying department.\n\n\u201cAt TFMC I had completed almost 96 Telkom buildings and I could tell you from the top of my head how much a building would cost. I got to a level where I decided I had worked enough on Telkom buildings and looked around for other challenges.\u201d\n\nThis led her to a position at Brian Heineberg & Associates, a multinational that operated many projects outside the country.\n\n\u201cMost of the projects were dollar-based or in the currency of that country. Every day you\u2019d have to wear your thinking cap with the currency fluctuations in mind and the projects were quite complex. This gave me a competitive edge. It meant I could do projects in Nigeria, Seychelles, Botswana and anywhere else. That really helped me,\u201d she says.\n\nI was headhunted by a company that wanted a black female director and shareholder\n\nMbutuma was made an associate quantity surveyor at Brian Heineberg & Associates and, in 2011, a partner, before she was recruited by Pentad Quantity Surveyors as a shareholder.\n\n\u201cI was headhunted by a company that wanted a black female director and shareholder. It was one of the biggest surveying firms in the country. It happened that I matched the company\u2019s criteria.\u201d\n\nMbutuma moved to Pentad as an executive director and shareholder.\n\nMbutuma was fortunate that the shares in the company were vendor financed.\n\n\u201cThe shares were sizeable and I was the first black female on such a board and they set the tone for their peers in the industry. I learnt a lot as a director there,\u201d she says.\n\nDuring her five years at Pentad, she won several awards, including the Young Business Achiever under 35 at the National Business Awards 2013 and the Black Business Quarterly Awards\u2019 2014 Winner for Young Executive under 35.\n\nI was a single mother who was depending on my salary and had to prepare myself that, as an entrepreneur, I became my own personal assistant, my own tea lady, my own everything\n\nThe experience prepared her to take the leap in 2015 and start her own shop \u2013 Azzaro Quantity Surveyors.\n\n\u201cI had to factor in a lot of matters. I was a single mother who was depending on my salary and had to prepare myself that, as an entrepreneur, I became my own personal assistant, my own tea lady, my own everything. So I met the right partners, saved up nine months\u2019 salary and we opened shop,\u201d she says.\n\nAs managing director of Azzaro, her work attracted interest from the multidisciplinary engineering consulting company GIBB, which wanted her to run its architectural subsidiary, SVA International.\n\n\u201cThe business landscape responded well to us. We let the work do the talking. People tend to worry about branding before they do the work.\n\n\u201cAzzaro may be less than five years old, but if you look at our performance, we have doubled our turnover every year,\u201d says Mbutuma, pointing out how her firm\u2019s client book had grown.\n\nThe firm employs 10 people.\n\nEarlier this year, she joined SVA as its managing director, which meant stepping down from the same position at her own company, where she remains an executive director.\n\nREAD: Jackie Mpondo-Hendricks ready to conquer as she becomes first black woman president of JCCI\n\nMbutuma pointed out that remaining an executive of two complementary companies needed a bit of convincing to her partners in Azzaro but a common ground was found.\n\nShe considers one of the biggest lessons she has learnt in business is to have the ability to see value in purchases.\n\n\u201cValue engineering is the biggest lesson for me. Understanding why you are buying what you are buying is easier said than done,\u201d she says.\n\nShe considers both positions as her day jobs and reckons she can only benefit from the experience.\n\nWhen not working, Mbutuma enjoys taking walks, listening to music and reading.", "description": "\u2018I was a single mum, depending on my salary, and had to prepare myself that as an entrepreneur I was my own personal assistant, my own tea lady, my own everything\u2019.", "authors": ["Lesetja Malope"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9439/db5b16a7fa8a496789b945142379d2e9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
