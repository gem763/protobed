The public has a right to know,\u201d she wrote.\n\nWithin 24 hours, Trump hit back, recalling an instance in the early 2000s in which, he said, Messing had called him \u201cSir\u201d and thanked him for revitalizing the lineup of NBC, where Will & Grace was airing.\n\n\u201cI have not forgotten that when it was announced that I was going to do The Apprentice, and when it then became a big hit, helping NBC\u2019s failed lineup greatly, @DebraMessing came up to me at an Upfront & profusely thanked me, even calling me \u2018Sir.\u2019 How times have changed!\u201d wrote Trump, who is no stranger to personally calling out celebrities.\n\nMessing, who regularly shares her political views online, took his attack in stride and instead used her platform not to throw digs back but to try and turn the focus toward Dorian\u2019s approach and gun violence prevention.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather you bring attention to the Category 5 Hurricane #Dorian threatening our south eastern coast, and the tragic & preventable shooting that occurred yesterday in Texas,\u201d she tweeted on Sunday.\n\nRELATED: Donald Trump \u2018Forgave\u2019 Personal Assistant Who Reportedly Leaked Info About His Kids, Including Tiffany and Ivanka\n\nI have not forgotten that when it was announced that I was going to do The Apprentice, and when it then became a big hit, helping NBC\u2019s failed lineup greatly, @DebraMessing came up to me at an Upfront & profusely thanked me, even calling me \u201cSir.\u201d How times have changed! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 1, 2019\n\nNow that I know I have your attention @realDonaldTrump, please read this thread\u2014 a PARTIAL list of souls lost to preventable,devastating gun violence. America wants universal background checks. The majority of Americans want assault weapons ban. Take Action and I\u2019ll call you Sir. https://t.co/BnaS9zgNps \u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) September 1, 2019\n\nShe continued: \u201cNow that I know I have your attention @realDonaldTrump, please read this thread- a PARTIAL list of souls lost to preventable, devastating gun violence. America wants universal background checks. The majority of Americans want assault weapons bans. Take Action and I\u2019ll call you Sir.\u201d\n\nMessing also explained her reasoning as to why she\u2019d requested the attendance for the fundraiser be made public, writing that when she donates, she\u2019s \u201cproud\u201d to do so and would assume anyone who donates to Trump would feel the same.\n\nShe later shared a list of campaigns she had donated to.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Amid Celeb Criticism He \u2018Inspires\u2019 Mass Shooters, Trump Condemns Racism and Violent Video Games\n\nI am proud to be a donor when I contribute to a campaign. I am happy to be listed when I attend a fundraiser. I am assuming anyone who donates to Trump\u2019s fundraiser would feel the same. Why wouldn\u2019t they? \u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) September 1, 2019\n\n\u201cSo! I woke up this morning to my phone notifications going crazy. I got scared. I thought \u2018Oh NO! Don\u2019t tell me there is a 3rd mass shooting this weekend! Don\u2019t tell me the Bahamians have lost their homes, their Lives by Hurricane #dorian!\u201d she later wrote on Instagram.\n\n\u201cIt was Trump. NOT CALLING McConnell and demanding an end to the recess, and an emergency meeting to pass the gun violence bills passed by the House months ago. NOT reversing his decision to move $155 MILLION DOLLARS from the FEMA Disaster Fund to ICE. Nope. What was on Trump\u2019s mind in the midst of such tragedy, was me. The LAST thing that should be on his mind or in his tweets,\u201d Messing wrote.\n\nAmid his more typical tweets attacking his political opponents and criticizing the media, Trump has also repeatedly tweeted about Dorian and the Texas shooting. Though he canceled a trip to Europe in advance of Dorian, he has reportedly played golf during prep for the storm.", "description": "Debra Messing Urges Donald Trump to Focus on Gun Reform", "authors": ["Rachel Desantis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/70SsCM88WFiR21weupsETQ--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/fb084a0f12877fd3b7d076f86f9dab89"}
