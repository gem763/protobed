It\u2019s the anti-Trump chant: \u2018Lock him up!\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Trump won just 4 percent of the District of Columbia vote in the 2016 election. Of course, many of the nearly 44,000 people in the stadium \u2014 with standing-room-only tickets surpassing the $1,000 mark \u2014 didn\u2019t actually live in D.C.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut first let\u2019s explain, once again, to the nation that D.C. is not the federal government. It is a town with plenty of people who were born, raised and educated here. It\u2019s not just this town. It\u2019s our town.\n\nD.C. natives recoiled at a paragraph about the World Series in the New York Times over the weekend that hit all those D.C. tropes:\n\n\u201cWashington can be an isolating and serious place to live sometimes, considering the steady influx of tourists, the underlying tension of politics and the residents who come and go, depending on the administration. It\u2019s uncommon to meet a Washington native, and it takes a lot for Washingtonians to get excited about the same thing. Calling it a fun-loving city would be a stretch.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGo to a go-go or join the older folks hand-dancing at a wedding and see how fun-loving D.C. is.\n\nAD\n\nStop and groove a little to the bucket drummers, listen to those two kids playing trombone near the National Archives or watch the cars cruise Hains Point, and D.C. won\u2019t seem serious at all.\n\nWitness the streets of D.C. the night Barack Obama was elected or the night Osama bin Laden was killed, and you\u2019ll know how excited this city can get.\n\nTalk to the administrative assistants, the security guards or the scores of office workers in downtown D.C. who help run the place \u2014 and not just the lobbyist or lawyer who commutes in from Virginia and has garage parking as part of the employment package \u2014 and you\u2019ll meet plenty of Washington natives.\n\nAD\n\nTo be fair, recent census data shows that the majority of current D.C. residents are, indeed, transplants. Only about 28 percent of adults living in D.C. today were born here. And a map created by the D.C. Policy Center shows the stark contrast of where D.C. natives live, showing barely 2 percent of the population in Foggy Bottom as D.C.-born, while east of the Anacostia River, about 80 percent of the residents were born here.\n\nAD\n\nBut there are also transplants like me who are not transients, who have set roots in the city and birthed new D.C. natives. This is an American city, not just a white dome and dark suits. And it\u2019s time to remind folks across the nation of that as they worry that rooting for the Nationals means siding with the official Washington they love to hate.\n\nNow, back to baseball.\n\nAD\n\nThere is no denying that the Nationals\u2019 fan base is largely white.\n\nThat\u2019s despite the fact that the last D.C. team to play in a World Series wasn\u2019t actually the 1933 Senators. It was the Homestead Grays, who dominated Negro League baseball for more than a decade straddling the 1930s and \u201940s.\n\nLocals have lamented the weak presence of youth baseball in the city, especially east of the river. And that\u2019s what motivated Vincent Gray to push for the spectacular Washington Nationals Youth Baseball Academy to be constructed there in 2014, back when the current D.C. Council member was mayor.\n\nAD\n\nStill, youth baseball leagues are expensive, and that ends up having an impact on sports fandom.\n\nAD\n\nSo it\u2019s easy to scan the stands in Nationals Park and find Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) or former senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) among the out-of-town faces and know that the Nationals fans aren\u2019t totally representative of the place once known as Chocolate City.\n\nOr you could just look at the conga line of Virginia plates in my D.C. neighborhood near the stadium all weekend to come to the same conclusion.\n\nYes, that stadium was filled with fans from Virginia, who have no major league team of their own. It was filled with transplants sent to Washington by American voters. It had Republicans and Democrats, lobbyists, lawyers, senators, journalists and others who had the money or influence to get their hands on a coveted ticket.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd when that stadium erupted in booing for Trump, they joined the 96 percent of D.C. voters outside the walls of that stadium in affirming the one thing nearly all Washington residents are united on.\n\nD.C. is anything but divided on this.\n\nRead more Petula Dvorak:\n\nAD", "description": "The people of the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 and many of its suburbs \u2014 despise President Trump.
