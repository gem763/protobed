REUTERS/Ints Kalnins\n\nPerry\u2019s departure was announced by U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday. He has found himself engulfed in Congress\u2019 impeachment investigation into whether the Republican president improperly withheld nearly $400 million in military aid for Ukraine in exchange for Kiev investigating his Democratic political rivals.\n\n\u201cIt has absolutely nothing to do with Ukraine,\u201d Perry said of his planned departure in a Fox News interview, adding he was looking to return to Texas for \u201cthe next adventure in life.\u201d\n\nLast week, the three Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives committees leading the impeachment probe issued a subpoena for Perry to turn over documents by Friday regarding any role he played in Trump\u2019s alleged bid to pressure Ukraine.\n\nAsked if he would meet House Democrats\u2019 deadline, Perry deferred to his legal team.\n\n\u201cOur general counsel is taking a look at that right now and when they send their answer at the end of the day, whatever their decision will be, I\u2019ll follow that,\u201d Perry said.\n\nThe impeachment probe centers on Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July 25 call to investigate his unsubstantiated allegation that former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, improperly tried to aid his son Hunter\u2019s business interests in Ukraine.\n\nTrump also asked Zelenskiy for \u201ca favor\u201d to look into a debunked conspiracy theory about the 2016 U.S. election involving a Democratic National Committee computer server and the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike.\n\nPerry told Fox he had pushed Trump to make the July call, agreeing with a characterization the president had made earlier.\n\nPerry said he urged Trump to talk in the call about corruption and providing Ukraine an alternative to natural gas from Russia, in the form of shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas. Biden never came up in any discussions Perry had with Zelenskiy or the White House, he said.\n\nPerry also said he had no problems about being told to consult with Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on Ukraine matters. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with him. I trust him,\u201d Perry said. When Perry was governor of Texas, he added, \u201cI used people outside of government all the time to give me information.\u201d", "description": "U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said on Friday the controversy over the Trump administration's handling of Ukraine had nothing to do with his resignation, adding he did not know whether he would cooperate with House Democrats' impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442403396&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H1AY", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
