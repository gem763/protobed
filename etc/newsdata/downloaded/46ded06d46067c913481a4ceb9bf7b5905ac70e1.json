In it, they asked Mr. Trump to express his support for H.R. 8, the bill passed by the House that requires background checks for private gun sales, including those at gun shows and over the internet. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, has so far refused to take up the measure, which is strongly opposed by the N.R.A.\n\n\u201cWe implore you to seize this moment when your leadership and influence over Republicans in Congress on the issue of guns is so critical,\u201d they wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times. \u201cPlease do not squander it by acceding to N.R.A.-backed proposals or other weak ideas that will do nothing to stop the continuing, horrific spread of gun violence and may, in some cases, actually make our communities less safe.\u201d", "description": "In a letter, the top two Democrats in Congress called on the president to expand background checks to nearly all gun buyers.", "authors": ["Sheryl Gay Stolberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/us/08DC-GUNS/08DC-GUNS-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
