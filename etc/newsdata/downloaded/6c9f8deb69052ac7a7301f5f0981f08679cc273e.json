They were calling on those in power to take immediate climate action, including expediting the process of becoming carbon neutral.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police cited the 1,445 arrests it had made - including that of a 75 year old - alongside protests disrupting travel and business in the City of London as reasons for clamping down on the protest.\n\n\u201cThese conditions have been imposed due to the continued breaches of the section 14 condition previously implemented, and ongoing serious disruption to the community,\u201d Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said in the announcement.\n\n\u201cWe have made significant progress in managing Extinction Rebellion\u2019s activity at sites across central London over this past week. Officers have begun the process of clearing Trafalgar Square and getting things back to normal,\u201d he added.\n\nExtinction Rebellion confirmed it would relinquish Trafalgar Square to authorities but in a statement said: \u201cThe International Rebellion continues.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Climate and Ecological Emergency isn\u2019t going away and we remain resolute in facing it,\u201d the statement continues.\n\n\u201cWe urge the Government and the authorities to join us in doing the same. We cannot do it alone.\u201d\n\nHowever, in a Tweet, the activism group admitted it broke the law \u201cin careful & deliberate ways, fully understanding the consequences of action being taken\u201d.\n\nIt went on: \u201cToday, an unprecedented, political, decision has been taken to shut down peaceful protest calling out the government for inaction in the face of crisis.\u201d\n\nReactions in the Twitterverse\n\nMany of those protesting took to social media to highlight their fury at the decision to end the protest a week early.", "description": "A series of tweets responding to the recent news that XR has been prohibited from protesting in central London.", "authors": ["Rachel Graham"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/29/62/1000x563_cmsv2_aaf13a99-4c7e-5985-96bd-f71ade084acc-4232962.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
