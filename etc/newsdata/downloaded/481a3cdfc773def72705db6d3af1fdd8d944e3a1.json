So called because it ran close to the strond, or shore, of the river, from the 1200s until the 1700s it was lined with great palaces and mansions.\n\nLinking the commerce and squalor of the City with Westminster\u2019s corridors of power, and with direct access to the Thames, it was only logical that the capital\u2019s aristocrats and bishops should build their homes here.
