But then Ross got Jos\u00e9 Altuve to swing at the first pitch and bounce into an easy double play and Nationals Park exploded as it hasn\u2019t all series. The stadium rocked.\n\nThey did again when the third hitter, Michael Brantley, grounded out to second. It\u2019s unclear what will come next, if Ross can sustain this success, but one thing was obvious: This crowd was the most fired-up of any this World Series.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen Joe Ross gets Jose Altuve to ground into double play, for first outs of Game Five of WS, Nats Park cheers like its the final out. Crowd chants \"Lets go, Joe\" while standing the whole inning. Whatever happens (and this isn't a movie), don't think I'll forget that for a while. \u2014 Thomas Boswell (@ThomasBoswellWP) October 28, 2019\n\nThe Nationals responded with their own tough leadoff at-bat. Shortstop Trea Turner battled Gerrit Cole and, though the shortstop struck out, he made Cole throw nine pitches to get it done. Adam Eaton and Anthony Rendon, a little more aggressive, both flew out to center to end the inning.\n\nPregame\n\nJos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, the chef and humanitarian, threw out the ceremonial first pitch to rousing applause from Nationals Park before Game 5. He received a lengthy ovation and is seen as a contrasting character to President Donald Tump, who will arrive for the game after it starts. He threw a strike to Ryan Zimmerman behind home plate and put on a pair of shades popularized by Gerardo Parra and An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez this season. It went over very well.\n\nAD\n\nIt appears as though President Trumps motorcade just arrived to Nationals Park for Game 5 of the World Series. #FINISHTHEFIGHT #Nats #NatsAstros pic.twitter.com/8qwJSuVJCQ \u2014 Scotty Smith (@ArcticScotty) October 27, 2019\n\nAlso, \u201cCalma\u201d vibes at Nationals Park.\n\nWent to check on the mood in the #Nats clubhouse.\n\n\n\nFound Brian Dozier and An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez singing \u201cCalma\u201d with PEDRO CAP\u00d3 HIMSELF!@pedrocapo // #STAYINTHEFIGHT pic.twitter.com/HQ3zVh76oh \u2014 Washington Nationals (@Nationals) October 27, 2019\n\nBrian Dozier couldn't keep his 'Calma' when @pedrocapo decided to join him for a duet. pic.twitter.com/3u05K9W0fS \u2014 Cut4 (@Cut4) October 27, 2019\n\nStephen, not sure you were supposed to pet the other dogs either.\n\nAD\n\nAsked Stephen Strasburg about Trump coming to the World Series.

The Nationals didn\u2019t have him on their postseason roster for the previous two rounds, preferring a pitcher with a similar skill set in Austin Voth. But they chose Ross for the World Series roster because they thought he, unlike Voth, would be able to pitch back-to-back games.\n\nNow, with Max Scherzer scratched from his Game 4 start due to muscle spasms in his neck, that length will be tested. Ross threw 19 pitches in Game 3 on Friday night, and Manager Dave Martinez told reporters he expected Ross to throw 75 to 80 pitches as the Game 4 starter.\n\nAD\n\nScherzer, Martinez and other Nationals expressed confidence in Ross because the team has so far overcome everything in a season of unexpected twists. No one embodies that more than Ross. The 26-year-old endured an up-and-down season in which he ping-ponged back and forth between the bullpen and the rotation, and the majors and Class AAA Fresno, a couple times throughout the year. He attributed unfamiliarity to his struggles as a reliever early in the season, and he had to lower his ERA to 9.22 before the team demoted him in late May.\n\nAD\n\nRoss returned to the Nationals for a brief stint in late June and later stuck in late July. He competed for the fifth-starter role with Erick Fedde and Voth, though none stuck. He finished this season 4-4 with a 5.48 ERA in 27 appearances, nine of which came as a starter. On Friday night in Game 3, Ross fired two scoreless innings of relief against the Astros and allowed one hit.\n\nRoss relies on two pitches, a sinker and slider, and will almost exclusively use his curveball, change-up and four-seam fastball against left-handed hitters. The Astros shifted their lineup from the first two games in Nationals Park and started Yordan Alvarez despite his limited mobility in left field. Ross has struggled against left-handed hitters overall this season, and especially against left-handed sluggers like Alvarez.\n\nAD\n\nStanding ovation at Nats Park for Joe Ross as he walks slowly, and alone from Nats dugout to the outfield to begin stretching. Sometimes the coolest things in sports are unscripted moments that just give you chills. If a crowd can lift an athlete, this one is going to try. \u2014 Thomas Boswell (@ThomasBoswellWP) October 27, 2019\n\nJoe Ross is getting a huge hand as he walks out for a pregame bullpen session he had no idea he would make 36 hours ago. \u2014 Barry Svrluga (@barrysvrluga) October 27, 2019\n\nHow to watch\n\nAD\n\nGame 5: Houston Astros at Washington Nationals (Series tied, 2-2)\n\nWhen: 8:07 p.m.\n\nWhere: Nationals Park in Washington\n\nStarting pitchers: Gerrit Cole (20-5, 2.50 ERA) vs. Joe Ross (4-4, 5.48 ERA)\n\nAdam Eaton walked back to the dugout perplexed. Houston Astros starter Jos\u00e9 Urquidy had surprised the Washington Nationals right fielder in the first inning of Game 4. The scouting report told Eaton to look for a change-up and not expect a slider, which Urquidy threw 10 percent of the time. But then Urquidy flipped his approach and threw three straight sliders \u2014 something Eaton said he hasn\u2019t done all postseason.\n\nEaton had to swing at the last one because he was down in the count, and he popped out to the catcher. Back in the dugout, he warned teammates the starter had switched his percentages. Expect the unexpected. This situation, and Eaton\u2019s reaction, provide a telling example of the special challenge posed by the World Series. These two teams are unfamiliar with each other at first, so the players must rely on scouting reports more than experience. Now, with the series tied at 2-2, it\u2019s about adjusting and counter-adjusting just enough to stay ahead of the curve and not enough to outsmart yourself.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a chess match,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cThis is some good baseball. It\u2019s going to be a thinking man\u2019s game.\u201d\n\nThe ambush by Urquidy in a way mirrors what the Nationals expect could happen in Games 5 and 6. They saw what made Astros aces Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander successful in Houston, and while they\u2019re prepared for those two to stick with it, they anticipate some tweaks. These are crucial because the series has suddenly become a \u201cbest-of-three\u201d \u2014 the most popular phrase in the Nationals\u2019 clubhouse after Saturday night\u2019s 8-1 loss.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about perspective,\u201d said shortstop Trea Turner when asked if he felt like the team missed an opportunity with Games 3 and 4 in Washington. \u201cIf you look at it as a three-game series to win the World Series, I think every team in the MLB would take it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe players\u2019 individual battles, the games within the game, changed the Nationals pitching as well. The scouting report told Patrick Corbin he could get a patient Astros lineup to bite on sliders after establishing his fastball in the strike zone, but it proved difficult to establish the fastball because the Astros lineup was so aggressive at first. They pounded the fastball early in counts and then, when Corbin tried to sequence the slider in the zone, jumped on that too. They laid off sliders outside the zone for the most part, and that forced an adjustment.\n\n\u201cWe had to mix and match a little bit, throwing his change-up and curveball a little more,\u201d said catcher Yan Gomes, who added, \u201cHe did a good job just going out there and giving us a chance to fight back.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals expressed full confidence that their next two starters, Max Scherzer in Game 5 and Stephen Strasburg in Game 6, could out-execute the Astros before they found out Scherzer couldn\u2019t go for Game 5. Joe Ross will start instead.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe moment still on Eaton\u2019s brain after the game wasn\u2019t his first at-bat against Urquidy. It was his second. The right fielder came to bat with a runner on second and two outs. He readied for a change-up or a slider, and the rookie right-hander dropped a curveball, which his scouting report said to expect 3 percent of the time. Eaton finally got a change-up on the second pitch but popped out to shortstop.\n\nThat didn\u2019t worry Eaton. Sometimes you can\u2019t do anything with a pitch you\u2019re ready for. He\u2019s less concerned with the result and more with the process. It\u2019s more difficult to hit when you have to expect everything.\n\nEaton left the clubhouse on Saturday night thinking about Cole, the Astros\u2019 Game 5 starter. He believed hitters had the advantage from this long series, but he raised his eyebrows and countered: \u201cAs soon as we say that, Cole\u2019s going to flip his percentages.\u201d That would carry serious implications, though, because when a pitcher goes off script \u201cyou kind of have to improvise.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNow I might not even look at last game,\u201d Eaton joked. But then he grew serious: \u201cWe try to formulate a plan. If it works out, great. If it doesn\u2019t, you have to quickly, from at-bat to at-bat, even pitch-to-pitch, make your adjustment.\u201d\n\nLineups\n\nHouston Astros\n\nGeorge Springer CF\n\nJos\u00e9 Altuve 2B\n\nMichael Brantley RF\n\nAlex Bregman 3B\n\nYuli Gurriel 1B\n\nYordan Alvarez LF\n\nCarlos Correa SS\n\nMart\u00edn Maldonado C\n\nGerrit Cole P\n\nWashington Nationals\n\nTrea Turner SS\n\nAdam Eaton RF\n\nAnthony Rendon 3B\n\nJuan Soto LF\n\nHowie Kendrick 2B\n\nRyan Zimmerman 1B\n\nVictor Robles CF\n\nYan Gomes C\n\nJoe Ross P\n\nGame 5 reading\n\nMeet Joe Ross, the Nationals\u2019 emergency starter in the most pivotal game in franchise history.
