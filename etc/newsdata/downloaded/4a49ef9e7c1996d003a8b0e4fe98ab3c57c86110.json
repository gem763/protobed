There are a total of four different devices bearing the S10 badge: the Galaxy S10, Galaxy S10 Plus, Galaxy S10E, and the yet-to-be-released Galaxy S10 5G. If you\u2019ve got your mind set (and your wallet open) to buy an S10 model, it can be daunting to figure out which one is right for you.\n\nI\u2019ve already reviewed the Galaxy S10 Plus in depth, and we\u2019ll have another piece on the Galaxy S10E very soon. For this article, I looked at the standard Galaxy S10 to see how it\u2019s different from the Plus model, and the few differences should be self-evident to most observers.\n\nOur review of Samsung Galaxy S10 Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Excellent display\n\nFast performance and good battery life\n\nVersatile camera system\n\nA headphone jack Bad Stuff New in-screen fingerprint scanner is slower and more finicky than older ones\n\nCamera performance is not as good as Pixel in low light\n\nSlow software update schedule Buy for $893.95 from Amazon Buy for $849.99 from Best Buy\n\nThe most obvious difference between the Galaxy S10 and the S10 Plus is the physical size: the S10 is smaller than the oversized S10 Plus. Both models are about the same thickness, but the S10 is roughly 4 millimeters narrower and about 8 millimeters shorter than the S10 Plus. As a result, I found the S10 to be much easier to handle in my day-to-day life. It fit in my pockets easier, it was less likely to fall out of my hands while I used it, and I could even do some things with one hand, thanks to Samsung\u2019s new software design. The power button and volume keys are still mounted awkwardly high on the sides of the phone, but they are slightly easier to use on the S10.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: the standard S10 is still a big phone, and if you really want a smaller device, you\u2019ll probably be happier with the S10E. But the S10 is more manageable than the S10 Plus, and I didn\u2019t feel the need to add a PopSocket or other modification to make it easier to handle like I did with the bigger phone.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus specs: Screen: 6.1-inch / 6.4-inch \u201cDynamic AMOLED\u201d display, Quad HD+ resolution in a 19:9 aspect ratio\n\nRear cameras: Wide angle 12-megapixel (77-degree) lens, telephoto 12-megapixel (45-degree) lens, and ultra wide 16-megapixel (123-degree) lens\n\nSelfie camera: 10-megapixel, 8-megapixel RGB depth camera (S10 Plus)\n\nDimensions: 70.4 x 149.9 x 7.8mm, 157 grams (S10) / 74.1 x 157.6 x 7.8mm, 175g (Ceramic: 198g) (S10 Plus)\n\nProcessor: Snapdragon 855 (in the US, Exynos in some regions)\n\nMemory: 8GB or 12GB RAM\n\nStorage: 128GB to 512GB (1TB on S10 Plus), expandable via microSD\n\nBattery: 3,400mAh (S10) / 4,100mAh (S10 Plus)\n\nOS: Android 9 Pie with Samsung One UI\n\nConnectivity: Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5, LTE Cat.20\n\nWireless charging, USB-C, headphone jack\n\nDue to the smaller size of the S10, its 6.1-inch screen is slightly smaller than the S10 Plus\u2019 6.4-inch display. That seems significant on paper and is noticeable when you hold the two models side-by-side, but a 6.1-inch screen is still very large, and I didn\u2019t really miss the extra screen size of the S10 Plus.\n\nEverything else about the S10\u2019s screen is the same as the S10 Plus\u2019: it\u2019s a high-resolution, extremely bright OLED panel with excellent viewing angles and rich, vibrant colors. The screen stretches all the way to the top and bottom of the S10\u2019s frame, and it has the same curved sides as the larger phone, which some might not like, but I found that they made the phone easier to hold.\n\nThe S10 unit that I\u2019ve been testing came with Samsung\u2019s factory-installed screen protector, which is compatible with the unique ultrasonic in-screen fingerprint scanner on the S10 and S10 Plus. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a cheap-feeling plastic film, and it actually made the already-troublesome fingerprint scanner work worse than without the protector. I ended up removing it after a couple of days of frustration; the experience was much better as a result.\n\nSpeaking of the fingerprint scanner, it is the same as the one on the S10 Plus, which means that it\u2019s not very good. It is slower and less accurate than the capacitive fingerprint scanners on many other phones, including last year\u2019s Galaxy S9, and it\u2019s nowhere near as convenient as the facial identification system on Apple\u2019s iPhone XS and XR. Removing the preinstalled screen protector did improve my hit rate, but I\u2019m still not a fan of this fingerprint scanner.\n\nThanks to the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and plenty of RAM, the S10 performs just as flawlessly as the S10 Plus. There doesn\u2019t seem to be anything I can do in my daily workflow to slow this phone down. Apps open smoothly and effortlessly, scrolling within apps is the smoothest experience I\u2019ve ever had on an Android phone, and the large amount of RAM lets me multitask and hop between apps without skipping a beat. I was thoroughly impressed with the performance of the S10 Plus, and I had the exact same experience with the standard S10.\n\nThe most noticeable difference in everyday use between the S10 and the S10 Plus is battery life. The S10\u2019s smaller size means it has a roughly 17 percent smaller battery than the S10 Plus (3,400mAh compared to 4,100mAh). As a result, it does not last as long between charges as the S10 Plus. In my testing, I\u2019ve been able to use it for an entire day between charges without issue, even when using it heavily. But it doesn\u2019t easily reach the two-day mark with light use, which the S10 Plus can do with aplomb.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say the S10\u2019s battery life is bad. In fact, I think it\u2019s just fine, and I don\u2019t have any issues with it. But if you\u2019re looking for the most battery life, the S10 Plus is what you should get. Like many other hardware features, the S10 has the same fast wired and wireless charging features as the S10 Plus as well as the ability to wirelessly charge other devices, such as wireless headphones or smartwatches.\n\nThe last difference between the S10 and the S10 Plus is found in the camera systems. The rear cameras are exactly the same: they have three different lenses available for standard, telephoto, and ultrawide compositions. The difference is on the front, where the S10 has just a single lens instead of the dual-camera lenses of the S10 Plus. Both have the same camera for capturing images and video, but the S10 Plus has a secondary image sensor that\u2019s used for depth mapping and portrait effects.\n\nIn practical use, however, there really isn\u2019t a difference that I was able to determine between the two. The standard S10 still has the same kinds of portrait mode effects as the S10 Plus, and there isn\u2019t an appreciable variance in quality between the two phones when you view them at normal distances. I did appreciate the fact that the S10\u2019s single lens hole-punch takes up less screen real estate than the dual-lens cutout of the S10 Plus, which allowed me to use a fun R2-D2 wallpaper.\n\nOverall, the S10 is nearly as impressive as the S10 Plus. In fact, the two are almost identical in all performance metrics aside from battery life. The S10\u2019s smaller frame is also easier to handle than the S10 Plus\u2019 girth. They even have the same software experience and features, including the indeterminate wait for updates that plagues all Samsung phones.\n\nBut the S10 is only $100 cheaper than the S10 Plus and $150 more expensive than the S10E, which offers much of the same experience in an even smaller size and without the annoyances of the in-display fingerprint scanner. I think the S10 Plus\u2019 extra cost will be worth it for those who want the absolute best battery life they can get, while the S10E will be more appealing to people who are looking for a smaller phone or wanting to save some money.\n\nThe standard S10 is in a weird middle ground between the S10 Plus and the S10E\n\nThat leaves the standard S10 in a sort of weird middle ground where it doesn\u2019t really stand out or excel at anything. At full price, it\u2019s hard to recommend the regular S10 over the other two models. But since Samsung phones typically fall in price and see significant promotions just a couple of months after release, the S10 could be an appealing option with the right deal. For now, though, my recommendation is to either go all the way with the S10 Plus or save some money and go with the S10E.\n\nWe will have another article on the Galaxy S10E very soon, so be sure to look out for that to learn all of that phone\u2019s unique characteristics and features.", "description": "Samsung has four different Galaxy S10 models out this year, and that can make it hard to choose which one to buy.
