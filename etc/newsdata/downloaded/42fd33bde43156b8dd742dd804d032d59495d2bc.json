ZDNet's Adrian Kingsley-Hughes sits down with Karen Roby to discuss if Apple events help sell iPhones, or are they a tool Apple uses to reassure investors and journalists? Read more: https://zd.net/2N9Xhoy\n\nIt's not often that Apple marks down its hardware -- including anything under its Beats brand. But it surprised everyone this week, by discounting the Beats Powerbeats Pro true wireless earbuds on Amazon. For a limited time, they're 20% off.\n\nSee it now:\n\nBeats Powerbeats Pro for $199.95 at Amazon\n\nThe headphones now cost $199.95, down from their usual $249.99. We price-checked them, and this is the best price we've spotted so far on the Powerbeats Pro, which originally debuted last spring. They feature Apple's H1 wireless chip, hands-free \"Hey Siri\" voice functionality, the ability to switch between paired Apple devices, and Lightning charging.\n\nWe reviewed them in May and found them to be the antithesis of Apple's $199 AirPods: The AirPods forgo buttons for touch controls, while the Powerbeats Pro has three buttons; the AirPods are one size, while the Powerbeats Pro have interchangeable tips and are adjustable; the AirPods weren't designed for athletes, while Powerbeats Pro were made with fitness buffs in mind; and the AirPods are minimalistic, while the Powerbeats Pro aren't as much.\n\nIf any of that interests you, all four colors of the PowerBeats Pro are now on sale at Amazon -- no promo required.\n\nSee it now:\n\nFor more great deals on devices, gadgetry, and tech for your enterprise, business, or home office, see ZDNet's Business Bargain Hunter blog.
