But the government has decided to extend the period they can stay while looking for a job to two years, reversing Mrs May's move.\n\nCurrent Home Secretary Priti Patel said this showed a \"global outlook\". But the campaign group Migration Watch has called it \"retrograde\", arguing that it will \"likely lead to foreign graduates staying on to stack shelves\". Here are the details of the new scheme.\n\nMeanwhile, a report by the OECD economics think tank suggests that going to university in England is still a good investment, despite increased tuition fees.\n\nBrexit: Labour's Watson demands pre-election referendum\n\nLabour deputy leader Tom Watson is insisting his party must make holding a referendum on Brexit its priority. In a speech, he will say that a general election might not break the current deadlock and that Labour must be \"crystal clear\" in campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU.\n\nThis puts him at odds with leader Jeremy Corbyn, who wants the party to offer voters both Leave and Remain options. Labour says it wants an election after 31 October, when a no-deal Brexit on that date has been ruled out.\n\nThe BBC asks what people around the UK think about Brexit.\n\nWith Parliament not sitting again until 14 October and the conference season about to begin, we also look at where the main parties stand.\n\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning\n\nBritish-Australian women 'held in Iran'\n\nIt's reported that two British-Australian women have been held in Iran. The Times says one has been jailed for 10 years and the other was arrested with her boyfriend 10 weeks ago on unknown charges. The two cases are not thought to be connected. We'll have the latest news here.\n\nThe women are understood to be in Tehran's Evin jail, where Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian mother of one from London, has been held on spying charges - which she denies - since 2016. We explain her case.\n\n'I studied by candlelight when I was homeless'\n\nBy Mimi Beard\n\nIn the evenings, at the YMCA, everyone would be sitting around and drinking, and I'd be in the corner writing up my notes. I was known as the \"sad\" one because I was always studying when everyone else was having fun.\n\nAnd, as much as I hate to admit it, I very nearly gave up, reluctant but defeated, ready to become a statistic. I had to leave during my first year to sort myself out. Life was bleak, I was tired and I couldn't see a way out.\n\nThings got really bad and on Halloween in 2017, when I was 19, I took an overdose of prescription drugs. It put me in a coma. I am so lucky to have woken up. The overdose was a line in the sand for me and I knew I had to turn things around.\n\nRead the full article\n\nWhat the papers say\n\nThe i says universities have welcomed the change in rules to allow overseas students to stay in the UK for longer. Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph asks if Prime Minister Boris Johnson has \"the answer\" to Brexit deadlock, in proposing an \"all-Ireland zone\" for checks on goods. The Financial Times says US President Donald Trump's sacking of National Security Adviser John Bolton is unlikely to lead to a softening of approach towards Iran. And the Sun leads on a report that a fire brigade has stopped using the children's TV character Fireman Sam as a mascot for being \"too male\" and putting off potential female recruits.\n\nDaily digest\n\nGrand Canyon British man dies in skydiving accident\n\nMigrants Eighty-six people attempted to cross Channel in one day\n\nHomophobia Hate crime charges fall despite rise in reports\n\nJamal Khashoggi \"Murder recording transcript\" published by newspaper\n\nIf you see one thing today\n\nHow to recover a lost Michelin star\n\nIf you listen to one thing today\n\nLucy Mangan on responsibility\n\nIf you read one thing today\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nFive ways the High Street is changing\n\nSign up for a morning briefing direct to your phone\n\nLookahead\n\n14:00 The body of former Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe is due to arrive in his home country, following his death in Singapore last week.\n\n19:00 Times Higher Education publishes its world university rankings, which were topped last year by Oxford.\n\nOn this day\n\n1980 The Marlborough diamond, worth \u00a3400,000, is taken in a robbery at a London jewellers.\n\nFrom elsewhere\n\nThe battle for a pay cheque in Kentucky coal country (New Yorker)\n\nHow Sri Lanka's suicide epidemic was allayed with British help (Telegraph)\n\nLast day of the dinosaurs' reign captured in stunning detail (National Geographic)\n\nCan you match brands such as Nike and Lego with their earliest inventions?
