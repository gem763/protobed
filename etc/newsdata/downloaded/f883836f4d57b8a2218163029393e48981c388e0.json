She had some great points in that article there.\u201d\n\nThe pro athlete went on to note Hill\u2019s article argued that historically black colleges and universities have struggled to compete financially with majority-white institutions since integration, possibly contributing to the large wealth gap between white and black families.\n\n\u201cWhat she was saying was simply we are trying to pump money and revenue into some of these communities that are still big disparities,\u201d Watson added. \u201cThis may be a way to do it. Obviously, that\u2019s in a vacuum for other factors to figure into that but when you read her argument, she lays it out very cleanly and it\u2019s actually something that I agree with.\u201d\n\nIngraham, meanwhile, was caught by surprise, likely figuring Watson would be on the same page as her and react in disgust to Hill\u2019s argument.\n\n\u201cWell I think Duke would have not been thrilled about you\u2019re not being there, but we will leave it at that,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cCollege sports would certainly be a lot different today if we went down a color-coded way of figuring out college admissions. That\u2019s like re-segregating the country! Why do we want that?!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo because segregation, as you know, is government-mandated,\u201d Watson calmly responded. \u201cThis is not segregation. If you read the article\u2026\u201d\n\nThe Fox News host, however, wouldn\u2019t let Watson finish his thought, rolling her eyes before cutting him off so she could end the interview.\n\n\u201cI read the article!\u201d Ingraham declared. \u201cI read the article. All right, we have to go.\u201d\n\nThe Fox News primetime star exhibited restraint, however, compared to other times where she found herself in political disagreement with a pro athlete. \u201cShut up and dribble,\u201d she infamously declared last year while discussing NBA star LeBron James\u2019 vocal opposition to President Trump.", "description": "At least Ingraham didn\u2019t tell Watson to \u201cshut up and tackle,\u201d so she\u2019s got that going for her.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568125051/ingraham-angle_30_kt2p2c", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
