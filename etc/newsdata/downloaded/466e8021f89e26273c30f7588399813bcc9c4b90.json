REUTERS/Edgar Su\n\nThe Wallabies face a confident England, whose pack are one of the best in the tournament, in the first quarter-final in Oita on Saturday.\n\nFew give Michael Cheika\u2019s side much of a chance, following an indifferent pool phase in which the coach\u2019s revolving-door selection policy for the back line has thus far failed to deliver a potent combination.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely more to come, as a team and as a backline. That\u2019s the exciting bit,\u201d said White, who plays his club rugby in England for last season\u2019s Premiership runners-up Exeter Chiefs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the confidence we\u2019ve got as a group that we\u2019re doing well but gee whizz when it does click we\u2019re going to be a force to be reckoned with,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nThe Wallabies struggled to overcome Fiji, Uruguay and Georgia, and lost 29-25 to Wales despite a storming second-half comeback, having trailed 23-8 at halftime.\n\nBut Australia\u2019s forwards did raise their game when they had to, and without revealing too much about how they might play in the knockout phase.\n\nIn their first match against a rampant Fiji, they tightened up, narrowed the game, squeezed the Pacific islanders and seized control in the second half.\n\nIn the final match against Georgia, a side renowned for a strong pack, the Wallabies forwards dominated the collisions, the breakdown and set piece only for the backs to suffer cohesion issues.\n\nPart of the problem may lie with Cheika having picked three different halfback combinations in the four Pool D games, and flyhalf Christian Leali\u2019ifano suggested that could be an issue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to focus on getting our best combinations that we feel will put our best game out there,\u201d Leali\u2019ifano said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a strength. There\u2019s a few different combinations in there.\u201d\n\nWhile Cheika also has multiple options in his midfield, his preferred combination has been Samu Kerevi and James O\u2019Connor, who have played three games together in Japan.\n\nTevita Kuridrani, in the first-choice midfield with Matt Giteau in the last World Cup, recognised he had probably dropped down the pecking order in Japan but it was all part of Cheika\u2019s plan to select combinations depending on the opposition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to work around the combinations, just trying to mix it up and see where we can take (on) the English side and defend against them,\u201d Kuridrani said.\n\n\u201c.. They haven\u2019t named a team yet so we don\u2019t know what\u2019s (happening).\u201d", "description": "An often maligned pack has so far gained most of the plaudits for an under-par Australia in the Rugby World Cup, and scrumhalf Nic White feels if the backs can raise their game to the forwards' level, England has better watch out.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441063928&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0O2", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
