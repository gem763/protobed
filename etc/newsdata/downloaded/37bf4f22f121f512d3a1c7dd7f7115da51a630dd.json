The first whistleblower\u2019s complaint, which the House Intelligence Committee released on Sept. 26, alleged that President Trump pressured the Ukrainian President to investigate one of his leading Democratic rivals, Joe Biden, and Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, and that the White House tried to keep records of a call between the two Presidents a secret.\n\nNEWS UPDATE: I can confirm this report of a second #whistleblower being represented by our legal team. They also made a protected disclosure under the law and cannot be retaliated against. This WBer has first hand knowledge. https://t.co/zYkUYgJ0mE \u2014 Mark S. Zaid (@MarkSZaidEsq) October 6, 2019\n\nZaid wrote on Twitter that the second whistleblower \u201calso made a protected disclosure under the law and cannot be retaliated against.\u201d\n\nZaid told ABC News on Sunday that the whistleblower has spoken to Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community, but has not yet communicated with the congressional committees conducting the impeachment inquiry. Zaid also told CNN that the second whistleblower has not filed their own complaint, but does not need to because communicating with the inspector general is a protected disclosure, and legally makes the second intelligence official a whistleblower.\n\nThe testimony of the second whistleblower could help to substantiate the claims in the original whistleblower complaint. After news of the initial complaint leaked, House Democrats announced that they would conduct an impeachment inquiry into the President\u2019s conduct. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi referred to the phone call when announcing the inquiry, saying that Trump was accused of asking the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, to \u201ctake actions which would benefit [Trump] politically.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump has denied putting pressure on Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election, calling his conversation with the Ukrainian President \u201ctotally appropriate,\u201d although he has said that he does feel that the Bidens should be investigated. Zelensky has also denied that Trump pressured him.\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint indicated that there are more U.S. officials with knowledge of the alleged effort to put pressure on Ukraine. About a dozen White House officials listened in to the call, and the whistleblower said that more than six U.S. officials \u201chave informed me of various facts,\u201d according to the complaint.", "description": "The second official has \u201cfirst-hand knowledge\u201d", "authors": ["Tara Law"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1X0kxPnnt1FkP.55jbf3pQ--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/883c53ba0e5699d4917d36b45377eab8", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
