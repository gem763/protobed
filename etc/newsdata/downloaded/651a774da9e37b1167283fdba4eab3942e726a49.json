If no party wins conclusively, the future of Brexit will be thrown up in the air again with options ranging from a tumultuous no-deal exit to another referendum that could scupper the whole divorce.\n\nCorbyn cast the election as a chance for real change. He frames Labour as a socialist alternative to the inequality and close relations with U.S. President Donald Trump that he says characterise Johnson's premiership.\n\n\"A Labour government will be on your side, while Boris Johnson's Conservatives \u2013 who think they\u2019re born to rule \u2013 will only look after the privileged few,\" Corbyn, 70, said.\n\nHe promised to nationalise rail, water and energy companies while taxing high earners to fund public services.\n\nConservative lawmaker Robert Halfon said that beside Brexit, domestic issues would play large.\n\nJohnson told lawmakers he was going \"to take the argument to Corbyn on One nation policies - spending on schools and hospitals and police... It wasn't just about Brexit,\" Halfon said.\n\nWhen Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, bet on an early election in 2017, she lost her slender majority - a failure that ultimately prevented her from ratifying her Brexit deal in parliament and sank her political career.\n\nJohnson's Conservatives are ahead of Labour by an average of about 10 percentage points in polls this month, though pollsters underestimated the support for Brexit in 2016 and admit that the models they use are wilting beside the Brexit furnace.\n\nBoth major parties will have to fight on at least three fronts: against each other while the Brexit Party led by Nigel Farage seeks to poach Brexit voters and the Liberal Democrats seeks to win over opponents of Brexit.\n\n\"At last the deadlock in parliament is broken. Brexit now has a chance to succeed,\" Farage said.
