Dante decided in his sophomore year that he would rather ride the train to the university, and officers would pick him up upon his return to Penn Station.\n\n\u201cIf you were told to bring him home from Yale, that\u2019s what we did,\u201d one former unit member said.\n\n\u201cIf the commanding officer of the 75 (precinct) said, \u2018move my kid to college,\u2019 do you really think that wouldn\u2019t kill his career?\u201d another former member commented. \u201cBut because it\u2019s the mayor, everyone just does it.\u201d\n\nThe reports come after city officials admitted in August that Executive Protection Unit officers helped move de Blasio\u2019s daughter Chiara out of her apartment to the mayor\u2019s residence while on duty.\n\n\u201cMembers of the family\u2019s detail were standing by and offered to help,\u201d the mayor\u2019s press secretary Freddi Goldstein insisted at the time. \u201cTheir involvement was strictly voluntary.\u201d\n\nThe NYC Department of Investigation is probing the current incident but has so far refused to elaborate on the details.\n\n\u201cDOI is aware of the matter and declines further comment,\u201d a DOI spokesperson told the Daily News.\n\nDe Blasio ended his presidential campaign earlier this year after consistently underperforming in polling. An August survey found the mayor had a lower approval rating than President Trump in deep-blue New York City.\n\nNew York City\u2019s largest police union slammed de Blasio when he announced the end of his presidential bid.\n\n\u201cThis campaign proved that it doesn\u2019t really matter whether Mayor Bill de Blasio is speaking to empty rooms in Iowa or spinning his wheels in a Park Slope gym. What matters to New Yorkers is that he isn\u2019t doing his job,\u201d union head Patrick J. Lynch said in a statement.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered members of his NYPD security detail to drive his son to Yale University and back multiple times, the New York Daily News\u00a0reported Monday.Former members of the Executive Protection Unit with direct knowledge of the matter said detectives from the unit ferried", "authors": ["Zachary Evans"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jTRhk06wduk02DetPCKpSg--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/7e9da370382935a3909d21166bb4acd7", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
