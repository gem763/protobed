When you have your chances you feel under so much pressure because you know you won\u2019t have many.\u201d\n\nThiem, who reached the semi-finals at Bercy last year, will face either Belgian 12th seed David Goffin or Bulgaria\u2019s Grigor Dimitrov in the last 16.\n\n\u201cThe draw is unreal, only top players,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was already for me a horrible draw in this round and it won\u2019t get any easier from here.\u201d\n\nWorld number seven Tsitsipas continued his return to form with a 7-6 (7/3), 6-3 victory over American Taylor Fritz.\n\nThe 21-year-old Tsitsipas struggled following the end of the clay-court season, but has since recovered and arrived in Paris having reached at least the semi-finals in each of his previous three events.\n\nHe claimed a tight opening set in a tie-break before cruising through the second to book a clash with either ninth seed Roberto Bautista Agut or in-form Australian teenager Alex de Minaur.\n\nCanadian youngster Denis Shapovalov saw off Monte Carlo Masters winner Fabio Fognini 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 to set up a third-round clash with sixth seed Alexander Zverev.\n\nThe 20-year-old Shapovalov has already reached three Masters semi-finals in his career, including at Miami earlier this year, while the defeat ends Fognini\u2019s chances of qualifying for next month\u2019s ATP Tour Finals in London.\n\nChile\u2019s Cristian Garin edged out former runner-up John Isner 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/4) and will next face Jeremy Chardy after the Frenchman\u2019s shock win over world number four Daniil Medvedev on Tuesday.\n\nLater on Wednesday, top seed Novak Djokovic will start his bid for a record-extending fifth Bercy title against French lucky loser Corentin Moutet, before Rafael Nadal takes on wildcard Adrian Mannarino.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Dominic Thiem booked his spot in the Paris Masters third round on Wednesday by edging out Milos Raonic in a marathon encounter, while", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/4b68a9_thiem-won-raonic-serving-30-aces-thiem-battles-raonic-in-paris-tsitsipas-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
