The procedure was generally viewed as safe but patients are made to sign a consent form.\n\nThe document largely warns of side-effects common with most injections - such as a greater risk of infection.\n\nWHAT IS OSTEOARTHRITIS? Osteoarthritis - sometimes called 'wear and tear' - is a condition that occurs when the surfaces within joints become damaged. Cartilage covering the ends of bones gradually thin over time, and the bone thickens, according to Arthritis Research UK. Around a third of people aged 45 years and over in the UK suffer from the condition. This equates to roughly 8.75 million people. At least 20 million are known to suffer in the US. It is different to rheumatoid arthritis, a long-term illness in which the immune system causes the body to attack itself, causing painful, swollen and stiff joints. Replacement joints are often necessary for osteoarthritis patients, because the joint has been worn down and causes agonising pain.\n\nResearchers from Boston University School of Medicine looked at 459 patients who had corticosteroid injections in their hip or knee at the hospital in 2018.\n\nThe participants were aged between 37 and 79. Scientists found that 36 patients (eight per cent) had complications down the line - 19 women and 17 men.\n\nThirty patients had the jab in their hip, while six had it in their knees. Twenty-six patients saw their osteoarthritis accelerate and worsen within a year.\n\nFour patients (0.9 per cent) suffered stress fractures - a break in the bone caused by accumulative damage - on their hips or knees.\n\nThree people (0.7 per cent) experienced rapid joint destruction which resulted in bone loss, while another three patients suffered complications with osteoarthritis.\n\nDr Guermazi, a professor in radiology, said: 'We've been telling patients that even if these injections don't relieve your pain, they're not going to hurt you. But now we suspect that this is not necessarily the case.'\n\nHe called for consent forms to detail the new dangers found in his team's research.\n\nHe added: 'Physicians do not commonly tell patients about the possibility of joint collapse or subchondral insufficiency fractures that may lead to earlier total hip or knee replacement.\n\n'This information should be part of the consent when you inject patients with intra-articular corticosteroids.'\n\nThe researchers recommend that patients receiving injections with little sign of osteoarthritis on an X-ray are carefully monitored - especially when the pain they experience is disproportionate to what's visible on the scan.\n\nThese patients, they point out, are at greater risk of destructive arthritis after injections.\n\nMost importantly, the team state that younger patients must be told of the potential consequences of an injection before they are given it.\n\nThe widespread use of corticosteroid injections - particularly in professional sport - means the potential of the study are enormous, Dr Guermazi believes.\n\nHe added: 'Intra-articular joint injection of steroids is a very common treatment for osteoarthritis-related pain, but potential aggravation of pre-existing conditions or actual side effects in a subset of patients need to be explored further to better understand the risks associated with it.\n\n'What we wanted to do with our paper is to tell physicians and patients to be careful, because these injections are likely not as safe as we thought.'", "description": "Boston University researchers found that while effective in treating pain, cortisone jabs can speed up a joint's disintegration and force patients to have full knee or hip replacements.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/14/19743010-0-image-a-19_1571147686595.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
