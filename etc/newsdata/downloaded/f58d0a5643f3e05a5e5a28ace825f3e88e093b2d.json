Login credentials and passwords that make it to these forums typically come from massive data breaches, which have happened frequently throughout the past year - in one recent example, 4.9 million DoorDash users' data were stolen just last week.\n\nHackers are using increasingly sophisticated database software to aggregate \"combo lists\" of millions of login credentials, according to Heid.\n\nEven if hackers only have one set of credentials - for example, a user's DoorDash login - they can easily make inroads into the user's accounts on other sites. Hackers use \"checkers,\" or programs that can take a user's email address and quickly determine if it's being used as a login on other sites. From there, hackers typically try to log into those other sites using the same password, betting that their targets use the same password across platforms. In many cases, they're successful.\n\n\"The people who are getting hit by that are the low-hanging fruit who reuse the same passwords,\" Heid said.\n\nWith hacking becoming increasingly profitable and hackers' software becoming more sophisticated, there's no indication that this trend will slow down any time soon. In the meantime, Heid advises that users change their passwords and ensure that passwords are different across different services.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Hackers use secret networks to aggregate and trade millions of stolen login credentials and passwords, according to a cybersecurity expert.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2860/fde7e79eb6434db3bd567d990a52a313.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
