But just 13 percent of registered Republicans in Florida who were surveyed said they approve of the formal impeachment inquiry. ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFloridians are nearly as evenly split over support for Trump\u2019s removal from office, with 46 percent of those polled indicating support and 48 percent opposing.\n\nAgain, the poll found support was highest among Democrats in the sample, at 83 percent, with just 8 percent of Republicans surveyed saying they support Trump\u2019s removal.\n\nThe state-wide poll is consistent with past national polling, although a new national poll released by CNN the same day indicates support for Trump\u2019s removal from office is at an all-time high. Fifty percent of poll participants believe that Trump should be impeached and removed, while 43 percent disagree.\n\nHowever, the national poll also found the support largely divided by party \u2014 with 87 percent of Democrats surveyed supporting impeachment and removal compared to just 6 percent of Republicans in the poll.\n\nThe Florida poll surveyed 669 registered voters from Oct. 14-20. There is a margin of error of 3.8 percentage points.", "description": "Florida voters are split over support for the House impeachment inquiry into President Trump, according to a new poll.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_101819getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
