Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi, to name a few, are places where there are less roads and more potholes. Authorities hardly pay attention to it but a group of students in Shivamogga in Karnataka have found an innovative way to grab everyone's attention. Members of Vidyarthi Sanghatane, a student organisation, staged a protest against poor road conditions in Shivamogga by planting saplings in potholes.\n\nANI\n\nThe students said that four-time Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa and his son -- a three-time MP and senior Minister KS Eshwarappa who holds two portfolios, are from Shivamogga but have done nothing to resolve the problems of potholes.\n\nVinay Rajavath, president of Vidyarthi Sanghatane, said that people are struggling to move on the street every day. \"Be it any party, all have ruined the youth's life as no constructive development has taken place in the area. I have written a letter in my blood stating the issues of Shivamogga including potholes,\" he claimed.\n\nKarnataka: Members of Vidyarthi Sanghatane, a student organisation, staged protest against 'poor road conditions' in Shivamogga by planting saplings in potholes.

In a bid to get government authorities to do something about the bad roads in Goa, a YouTuber named Cecille Rodrigues posted a quirky song on potholes.\n\nThe song takes inspiration from the famous Konkani pop singer Lorna Cordeiro's 70s number Bebdo. The original Bebdo is about a woman singing of the woes of being married to an alcoholic.\n\n(With agency inputs)", "description": "Members of Vidyarthi Sanghatane, a student organisation staged a protest against poor road conditions in Shivamogga by planting saplings in potholes.
