The customer clicks what they\u2019re buying, puts it in the cart, pays and leaves.\n\nBut the national grocery chain has grander ambitions. Soon, it hopes the cart will know exactly what you\u2019re putting inside of it without the need to scan a barcode or tap buttons on a screen.\n\n\u201cThe cart gets smarter as you shop,\u201d Mathieu Lacoursiere, Sobeys vice-president of retail support, said on Wednesday.\n\nHe expects the carts\u2019 network of mounted cameras \u2014 taking 100 pictures of every item \u2014 will soon be able to tell whether an airborne apple, on its short flight from a customer\u2019s hand to the bottom of the basket, is a McIntosh or an Empire. It will also be able to take a customer\u2019s grocery list, plan a route through the store and guide them to each item using an on-screen map. Or, a customer can just choose a recipe and the cart will show them where the requisite ingredients are in the store.\n\nTake out an item and return it to the shelf, and the cart, registering the lightened load, might say, \u201cWe believe you just took out the pears\u201d and adjust the bill displayed on screen.\n\nSobeys dispatched a fleet of 10 smart carts to a store in the Toronto suburb of Oakville, Ont., for testing on Wednesday. Employees at the Glenn Abbey location will take three weeks getting used to the carts before allowing customers to try them.\n\nThe company wouldn\u2019t say what it plans to do with the carts after the pilot project. The New York-based manufacturer supplying the carts, Caper Inc., last month closed US$10 million in Series A funding, with plans to make more carts.\n\n\u201cWe can make thousands of these things a week,\u201d Caper co-founder Ahmed Beshry said.\n\nFor now, Sobeys isn\u2019t looking to replace regular carts with smart carts \u2014 an undertaking that would involve between 100 to 250 carts per store. The reason Sobeys started looking at smart carts in the first place, Lacoursiere said, was to address the checkout \u201cpain point.\u201d Smart carts are meant to give customers an extra option, along with self-checkout machines and human cashiers.\n\nLong lineups at check-out is one of the biggest issues for customers, second only to out-of-stock items, said Jean-Pierre Lacroix, whose firm Shikatani Lacroix works on grocery store design and consulted with Sobeys early in the smart cart project. Smart carts could be a better answer to the checkout problem than \u201cawkward and clumsy\u201d self-checkouts, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople are still reluctant to use the self-checkout, unless you\u2019re a millennial,\u201d he said. Those machines continue to frustrate customers despite years of fine-tuning, because they\u2019re \u201cforcing you into new behaviour.\u201d\n\n\u201cPutting a product in your basket? You\u2019ve been doing that. Your father and mother have been doing that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing that for the last 100 years.\u201d\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: jedmiston@nationalpost.com | Twitter: jakeedmiston", "description": "Cart has a built-in scale that weighs produce placed inside, as well a scanner, a screen that shows the total bill and a card reader for payments", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/smart-cart.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
