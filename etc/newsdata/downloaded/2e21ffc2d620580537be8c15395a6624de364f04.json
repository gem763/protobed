The 21-year-old Londoner was 11 when her dad found her singing an original composition on guitar (he thought it was the latest Rihanna single), and in the resulting 10 years she spent her time crafting music, getting to a point where, finally, she was ready to share her talents with the world.\n\nWriting and producing all her own music, Ama released her debut EP, DDD, in 2018, a collection of slick and soulful R&B. And it didn\u2019t arrive alone. Ama also wrote, starred in and directed a short film to accompany the three-song collection, all shot by her sister Mahalia. The result is a stunning 13-minute short that feels more like an epic.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since then, however, and Ama has been busy. Along with an appearance in the latest issue of i-D, The Post Truth Truth Issue, she has also been busy grafting away writing new music.\n\nWith that comes new videos. And for Ama Lou\u2019s latest single, the Destiny\u2019s Child-esque \u201cNorthside\u201d, we\u2019re premiering the accompanying music video.\n\n\u201cI wrote the song after experiencing a personal homecoming last year,\u201d Ama tells i-D. \u201cI travel a lot and live bicoastal so spending a lot of time living in LA I felt a little out of place coming back to the UK, but that feeling was quickly overrun by the satisfying feeling of knowing that I\u2019m from North London, this is my town and it always will be.\"\n\nShot by Ama\u2019s longtime collaborator and sister, Mahalia, and featuring some of Ama\u2019s closest friends, including Odd Future\u2019s Taco, A$AP Nast and model Fai Khadra, the video just captures a bunch of young people having fun.\n\nIt\u2019s a simple concept, sure, but in the context of today\u2019s complicated world, sometimes simplicity is what you need. It\u2019s also a joy to see someone else just having the time of their lives. There\u2019s something exuberant but real about the video, which is only grounded more when paired with the song, it\u2019s background noise of normal chit-chat and the fire lyrics. There\u2019s also one particular moment where Ama Lou throws her phone off screen and, honestly, it\u2019s a mood.\n\n\u201cI wanted to create something with the energy of the Diddy and Mase videos from the mid 90s early 2000s,\u201d Ama says. \u201cMe and my sister worked on creating the right vibe, but going at it in our own way with a solid nod to the references. Also I managed to drag her from behind the camera \u2013 that's her I\u2019m pulling in towards the end of the video.\"\n\nWatch the video below.\n\n\u201cNorthside\u201d is the first taste from Ama Lou\u2019s upcoming EP, due for release later this year. Get on board, y\u2019all. The Post Truth Truth Issue is available now.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "With \u201cNorthside\u201d and its video -- which we\u2019re premiering right here! -- the 21-year-old Londoner gives us a whole vibe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d95c5812dd1d2000adb9bc7/lede/1570097321092-ama-lou.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
