Previous research has found that the stripes of a zebra may have evolved to fend off biting flies. Now, scientists have found that the same trick could work for cows if they are painted to look like zebras. Why is that? Flies are attracted to animals by a range of factors including odour, brightness and body temperature. However, experts believe the clashing black-and-white colours of a zebra - even a fake one - may put them off. The 'motion detection systems' of the approaching insects may also be thrown into confusion by the black-and-white colours, scientists say. 'This phenomenon has been explained as modulation brightness or polarized light,' researchers said. One study found that the flies 'approached their target faster and failed to decelerate in the terminal stages of their flights before contacting zebra surfaces,' they said. 'Nevertheless, future studies that improve our understanding of this mechanism will be required to support these hypotheses,' they added.\n\nScientists hailed the discovery as an 'environmentally friendly, practical method of controlling biting flies'.\n\nFarmers generally use insecticide against the pests, but the flies often develop resistance to the chemicals.\n\nFlies can cause as much as $2.2billion (\u00a31.8billion) of damage to the American cattle industry every year by attacking cows, previous research has found.\n\nIn the experiment, two groups of three Japanese black cows were given various coasts of paint and left for 30 minutes to reduce the impact of the smell of paint.\n\nIn each group of three, one cow was painted with white stripes to look like a zebra, another was given black stripes and the third was left unpainted.\n\nScientists then took pictures of the three animals and counted how many flies they could see.\n\nWhen they counted, they found that the black-and-white cow had attracted around half as many flies as the other two.\n\nWhile the unaltered cow had an average of 42 flies on its body, and the black-striped cow typically had 38, the zebra-like cow had only 15.\n\nExplaining why that might be, scientists said that flies had been known to 'approach their target faster and fail to decelerate' when confused by 'polarising' black-and-white stripes.\n\nThere was little difference between the unpainted cows and the black-striped ones.\n\nBlack and white stripes: In each group of three Japanese black cows, one was painted like this to look like a zebra. Scientists found that reduced the number of flies by as much as half\n\nBlack stripes only: Some of the cows were painted in less striking colours than the zebra-like cattle, like this. They attracted almost twice as many flies\n\nUnaltered: For comparison, some cows were left unpainted, like this. There was little difference between the unpainted cows and the black-striped ones\n\nScientists also counted the number of times that the cows had shown 'defensive behaviours'.\n\nThese behaviours were described as 'head throws, ear beats, leg stamps, skin twitches, and tail flicks'.\n\nSimilarly, the black-and-white 'zebra' cows were around 20 per cent less likely to try to fend off the flies than their unpainted or black-striped counterparts.\n\n'Because of the economic loss associated with this pest, cattle owners have primarily used insecticidal control measures,' researchers wrote.\n\n'However, insects often evolve resistance to a new pesticide within about a decade after its introduction.\n\n'We found that painting zebra-like stripes on cows can decrease the incidence of biting flies landing on individuals by 50 per cent.\n\n'Painting has been used as an external marker to identify animals at a distance in wildlife and livestock research and managements.\n\n'It is a cheap, easy, and animal welfare friendly method to mark animals.\n\n'However, painting is usually considered a short-term marker, which can persist from a few weeks to several months.\n\n'Therefore, in the future, the development of more effective techniques to ensure the persistence of black-and-white stripes on livestock during the biting fly season may be necessary in order to apply this method to animal production sites.'\n\nThe study is published in the journal PLOS One.", "description": "Japanese black cows such as this one attracted only half as many flies when they were painted black and white, an experiment carried out in Japan showed.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/20/19457228-0-image-a-13_1570562069452.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
