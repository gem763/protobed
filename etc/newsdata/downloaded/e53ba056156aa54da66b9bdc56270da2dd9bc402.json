(Angela N./Flickr)\n\nTODAY\u2019S DAILY DIGIT\n\n9/10: Pretty darn nice, and only a couple degrees above average. We just need some rain, and any moments of (rain-free) cloudiness today aren\u2019t appreciated.\n\nEXPRESS FORECAST\n\nToday: Mix of sun and clouds. Highs: Near-70 to mid-70s.\n\nTonight: Less breeze, cloudier. Lows: Low to mid-50s.\n\nSaturday: Partly sunny. Highs: Low to mid-70s.\n\nSunday: Cloudier. Slight shower chance. Highs: Mid-60s to near 70.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nFORECAST IN DETAIL\n\nBad news first: Drought continues, with no end in sight. Good news: It\u2019s comfortable and fall-like. Warmth may stay above-average (70 degrees) until Sunday, when our average high dips to 69 degrees \u2014 the same day we actually may top out below 70!\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device.

We should be able to pierce 70 degrees in most spots with sunshine dominant by midday, if not earlier, but let\u2019s say near-70 to mid-70s to account for some varying conditions possible in our region. North and northeasterly breezes should stay under 10 mph for the most part. Confidence: Medium\n\nTonight: Clouds slowly increase but without rain chances. Breezes slowly die down. Fairly comfortable and a bit warmer than normal for the region, with temperatures near dawn in the low to mid-50s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nFollow us on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for the latest updates. For related traffic news, check out Gridlock. Keep reading for the forecast into next week...\n\nTomorrow (Saturday): A cold front approaches from the west, unfortunately without much or any rain to alleviate our drought. Current expectations favor sufficient sunshine to the extent that we should still get into the low to mid-70s, but we could have some cloudier moments. Breezes around 5 mph may vary in direction during the day. Confidence: Medium\n\nTomorrow night: Rain chances remain very low. We can\u2019t rule out a few raindrops or a quick shower as the cold front finishes passing through. Northwesterly winds may noticeably pick up after sunset but still generally stay under 15 mph. Skies should stay partly to mostly cloudy. Upper 40s to mid-50s are probably the lowest temperatures we see by dawn in the region, with the warmest spots inside the Beltway, of course. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nSunday: Clouds very slowly start to part, mixing with sunshine. Showers may stay well to our south, so we don\u2019t foresee raindrops at this time, but stay tuned. Mid-60s to near 70 degrees is our likeliest high temperature range. If we see more sunshine and even lower rain chances (if that were possible), we could tack on a couple more degrees to our high temperatures. Confidence: Medium\n\nSunday night: Any clouds should decrease, but we can\u2019t fully rule out a quick shower. We\u2019ll watch it. Still, enough sky should be visible to check out the rising Hunter\u2019s Full Moon in the evening. Temperatures take their time falling into the late overnight hours, bottoming out downtown around the mid-50s. Perhaps in the upper 40s in the cooler spots outside the Beltway, which is actually a bit warmer than average as we near the middle of October! Confidence: Medium\n\nMild 70s may reign, with more sun than clouds Columbus Day and Tuesday. Stay tuned as we get closer and zero in on cloudiness levels and a more exact temperature range. We\u2019ll watch whether raindrops develop later into Tuesday and Tuesday night. Still, it looks comfortable, with light breezes and comfortable air (dew points near 50 degrees).
