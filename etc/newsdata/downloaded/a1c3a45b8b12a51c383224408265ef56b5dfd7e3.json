It is wholly inadequate for the government of any other.\u201d\n\nNo secular system of values has yet been found that replaces the role of religion. What we call \u201cvalues\u201d today are just the \u201cvapor trails of Christianity.\u201d\n\nThe Founding Fathers knew the greatest risk to America would not come from external foes but would be because its people couldn\u2019t handle freedom, said Barr.\n\nIt\u2019s a brilliant, clear-headed speech, and you don\u2019t have to be religious to appreciate the historical logic.\n\nThe problem today is that militant secularists \u2014 as in people who hate religion and want to drive it out of the public square, if not eradicate it by force \u2014 are not content to live and let live.\n\nAs if to prove Barr\u2019s point, the assault on his speech was swift and vicious, especially at that woke citadel of militant secularism, The New York Times.\n\nReaders could barely contain their rage in 1,500 odd comments gathered under a column trashing Barr by Occupy Wall Street fan Paul Krugman, titled \u201cGod is now Co-conspirator.\u201d\n\nKrugman dismissed the distinguished lawyer, who has served his nation twice as attorney general, as a mere Trump \u201cminion,\u201d preaching the stuff of \u201cwitch hunts and pogroms.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow inappropriate\u201d for Barr, \u201cof all people,\u201d to give such a speech, Krugman wrote. The \u201cnation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer has no business denouncing those who exercise that freedom by choosing not to endorse any \u00adreligion.\u201d\n\nOf course, Barr had said nothing of the sort.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that anyone acting in good faith, who listened to the speech or read the transcript, could possibly have drawn the conclusions in Krugman\u2019s \u00adcolumn.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether his comprehension skills are disordered or he just was so determined to malign Barr that he went off half-cocked on the basis of a couple of quotes in news stories.\n\nSurely a professional columnist wouldn\u2019t pronounce on something he hadn\u2019t seen. The speech is only 37 minutes long, just 4,000 words.\n\nWhether or not Krugman familiarized himself with the material before penning his diatribe, his perverse misrepresentation of Barr\u2019s speech does his readers a grave disservice.\n\nNot that most of them seemed to mind, commenting freely about a mythical speech Barr did not give and that they had not bothered to watch.\n\nSupremely confident in their ignorance, they concluded Barr was \u201ca repressed, sanctimonious fundamentalist Catholic,\u201d \u201ca self-right\u00adeous phony,\u201d \u201ca disgrace to his office,\u201d \u201csomeone who believes in magic spirits in the sky,\u201d \u201cBible toting bigot!\u201d \u201cTrump enabler,\u201d \u201cscariest person,\u201d \u201cdisturbing, disingenuous, disgusting.\u201d\n\nThe speech was \u201cpractically straight out of \u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was \u201ctheocracy based on Opus Dei principles,\u201d \u201cauthoritarian boilerplate,\u201d \u201cfanatical,\u201d \u201cthe ole\u2019 Catholic Inquisition,\u201d \u201ctheocracy based on Opus Dei principles,\u201d \u201cConstitutional depravity,\u201d \u201cfascism,\u201d \u201cfanaticism.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone who believes in preposterous mythologies is not qualified to hold a governmental position.\u201d\n\n\u201cWilliam \u2018Barr\u2019 should be disbarred!\u201d\n\n\u201cEliminate the religious tax exemption.\u201d\n\nA Biden curse\n\nIt was hard not to feel sorry for Hunter Biden during his ABC interview this week, as he tried to explain the nepotism that has sparked such controversy. He might be 49, but he has the air of a lost boy.\n\nWhen you know about his childhood it makes sense. He was 3 when he was injured in a car crash that killed his mother and baby sister. By all reports his father, Joe Biden, was a loving but largely absent father in Washington.\n\nHunter has suffered addiction issues and appears to hero-worship his dad.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s literally nothing, as a young man or as a full-grown adult that my father in some way hasn\u2019t had influence over,\u201d he said, admitting he \u201cprobably\u201d would not have been paid $50,000 a month to join the board of a Ukranian gas company if his father hadn\u2019t been vice president.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn\u2019t Biden.\u201d\n\nIt is Joe Biden who is at fault for placing his trusting son in an invidious position, and he\u2019s still not taking responsibility.\n\nPete kicks \u2018Butt\u2019\n\nThe meanest, but most satisfying, moment of the Dem debate Tuesday night was Pete Buttigieg\u2019s pungent zinger for poor Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage,\u201d the Navy veteran told the overgrown skateboarder. Ouch.\n\nSo Mayor Pete packs a punch behind the choirboy good looks.\n\nHe also landed a beauty on Elizabeth Warren for evading questions on the multitrillion-dollar costs of Medicare for All: \u201cYour signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.\u201d\n\nBut he left it to Amy Klobuchar to really sink the boot in, telling Warren: \u201cThe difference between a plan and a pipe dream is a plan is something that you can actually get done.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cpipe dream\u201d tag will come to define Warren.", "description": "Judging by the spittle-flecked hatred coming his way, Attorney General Bill Barr scored a bull's-eye on the intolerant left with his speech at Notre Dame Saturday defending religious liberty.", "authors": ["Miranda Devine", "October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/william-barr-notre-dame.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
