Bang! podcast than just about anything else he\u2019s done in his life. At 620 episodes and counting, the show recently celebrated its 10-year anniversary with a record-setting 10-hour-long podcast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still fun, it\u2019s still great, I\u2019m really enjoying it,\u201d Aukerman tells me on this week\u2019s episode of The Last Laugh podcast. And yet, if someone asked him, \u201cHey, do you want to direct more movies?\u201d he half-jokes, \u201cI would gladly kick podcasting to the curb in a second.\u201d\n\nBesides Comedy Bang! Bang!, Aukerman is probably best known for being the man behind Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis. Over the past 11 years, he has directed most of that popular web series\u2019 21 episodes\u2014including the ones in which Galifianakis sat down to insult Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to their faces.\n\nNow, Aukerman has directed the star-packed, fully improvised Between Two Ferns: The Movie, which just premiered on Netflix last Friday. It wasn\u2019t easy.\n\n\u201cIn a certain way, having a movie validates these things,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the same way that SNL sketch movies, like Wayne\u2019s World, take something to another level.\u201d In addition to Wayne\u2019s World, Aukerman thought a lot about Borat and This Is Spinal Tap, both of which were almost entirely improvised. He decided to take the same mockumentary-style approach for Between Two Ferns.\n\n\u201cI thought, what if we could make a movie like a real documentary?\u201d Aukerman says. \u201cWe set up the actual situations, we know the relationships with the characters, let\u2019s just start interviewing the characters and start having them do scenes without really any plot and figure it out from there. We\u2019ll shoot a bunch of interviews with celebrities, we\u2019ll shoot a bunch of stuff in hotels, adventures along the way. And then I\u2019ll get in the editing room, like a documentarian does, and figure out the structure in post.\u201d\n\nThe entire project was a puzzle that became increasingly difficult once they realized they needed at least 15 major celebrity cameos to make it work. That doesn\u2019t include Galifianakis, who was still a couple of years away from becoming a major movie star when they shot the first episode of the series in 2008.\n\nWhen I point out that, with the film, Aukerman has created a \u201cBizarro World\u201d in which Galifianakis never became a star and is merely a public access host in North Carolina, the director jokes, \u201cI think the Bizarro World is the one where he is a movie star. That\u2019s the one I can\u2019t believe. Trump is president and Zach is a movie star? We\u2019ve clearly done something wrong.\u201d\n\nHighlights from our conversation are below and you can listen to the whole thing right now by subscribing to The Last Laugh on Apple Podcasts, the Himalaya app or wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nHow he pulled off all of those celebrity cameos\n\n\u201cWhen we started filming we knew we needed 15 interviews. But we maybe had one person, maybe two people who had agreed to do it. I think Tiffany Haddish was on our first or second day. We just knew we had to get the people, including the first scene in the movie with Matthew McConaughey. It\u2019s a challenge, because every single person will only give you a certain amount of time. I think I had two hours with him to do all of that including the interview. The least amount of time we had with anyone was John Legend. I think we had him for 40 minutes at 7 a.m. while he was filming his Christmas special. But we actually got him back on another day to film a scene with him because he was so funny in it.\u201d\n\nHow Peter Dinklage ended up with the most \u2018pivotal\u2019 cameo in the film\n\n\u201cEvery single person that we would talk to about it, they\u2019d say, \u2018Hey, this person\u2019s in!\u2019 And we\u2019d ask, \u2018What are the limitations?\u2019 \u2018Well, they\u2019ll only be here for an hour.\u2019 So you sort of slot people into different slots that don\u2019t take a lot of time. So we\u2019re talking to Peter Dinklage on the phone\u2014 he\u2019s in New York and sometimes the star will want to have a conversation just to see what they\u2019re getting into. So we\u2019re saying, \u2018It\u2019s going to be fun!\u2019 and he\u2019s saying, \u2018Yeah, this all sounds good. So how long do you need me, like, a week?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Uh, yeah, we\u2019ll take you for a week!\u2019 So that\u2019s how he became the pivotal role.\u201d\n\nOn the origins of the \u2018Between Two Ferns\u2019 web series\n\n\u201cWe batted ideas back and forth and [Galifianakis] said, \u2018You know, it would be really funny to do a talk show.\u2019 He didn\u2019t know what the tone of it would be. But he said, you know, \u2018I used to have a public access show and I\u2019ve always wanted to do a show called Between Two Ferns, which I laughed at really hard, because I had a public access show growing up and I knew the aesthetics of the public access show. They don\u2019t have a lot of money. So essentially you\u2019ll get a curtain, two chairs and to fill up the space you\u2019ll get two big plants to make it look like it\u2019s not just an empty void. So we said, let\u2019s just improv it. We got Michael Cera and just improv\u2019d it in a basement. We knew it was really funny and at a certain point Funny or Die had been established so we put it up there and millions of people decided to watch it.\u201d\n\nWill there be more \u2018Between Two Ferns\u2019 episodes after the movie?\n\n\u201cAt a certain point, Zach especially was saying, \u2018I think this is the end of Between Two Ferns.\u2019 And in my mind I\u2019m just like, yeah, you say that now but if in four months The Rock calls us up then we\u2019re back to making the videos! And of course I saw Zach after a couple of months the other day and he was like, \u2018So what do we think about a sequel?\u2019 So I think it could continue on, definitely. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an endpoint.\u201d\n\nNext week on The Last Laugh podcast: Stand-up comedian and host of MTV\u2019s The Tom Green Show, Tom Green.", "description": "On this week\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Last Laugh\u201d podcast, \u201cComedy Bang!
