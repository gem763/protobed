Labour says it will not agree to an election until the European Union decides how long an extension to grant Britain to leave. And European leaders say they will not make that decision until the deadlock in London is broken.\n\nEven by the wheel-spinning standards of Brexit, there was something remarkable about the circular futility of events on Friday.\n\nTwelve-hundred nineteen days have passed since the British people voted to leave the European Union, and Britain\u2019s departure now seems more of a mirage than ever. The destination looms on the horizon but eludes every effort to reach it, as Britain\u2019s politicians wage a kind of forever war over how, or even whether, to carry out the results of that much-disputed referendum.\n\nWith Mr. Johnson and his opponents locked in their umpteenth standoff this week, the debate drifted farther and farther away from the best way to negotiate Britain\u2019s departure \u2014 let alone the costs or benefits of doing Brexit \u2014 and more toward a crude display of political positioning in advance of a likely election.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the Labour Party and the European Union are all waiting for the other to make the next move.
