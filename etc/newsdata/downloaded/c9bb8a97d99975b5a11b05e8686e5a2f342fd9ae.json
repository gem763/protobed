The enhanced authentication will help protect us and you from phishing attacks by spammers. Phishing is the act of sending fraudulent e-mails that look like Reuters e-mails, but are not. This is done in an attempt to trick you into providing personal information such as passwords, social security numbers and/or credit card numbers or to put malicious software on your computer.\n\n\n\nIn order to implement these changes we need to modify our mailing address. The new address is newsletters@email.reuters.com. Please add it to your address book today. In doing so, you will ensure that our e-mails are delivered to your inbox as expected.\n\n\n\nFor more information about our data security or privacy policies, please click here.", "description": "Reuters is making some important authentication security enhancements to our e-mail programs.
