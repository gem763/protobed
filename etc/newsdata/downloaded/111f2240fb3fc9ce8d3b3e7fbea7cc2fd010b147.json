We did some tests. And then a month later he said, \"You have the worst diet I've ever met from any patient.\"\n\n'So I went, \"Okay, out of the smoking, the drinking, and diet, what do I have to drop?\" And he said, \"The diet.\" So I said, \"I'm in!\"\n\n'It was easier than I thought, and part of the reason I did it was because of Eric. I realised if I didn't sort myself out physically, I wouldn't be able to catch up with him.\n\n'Because the minute he gets up to the minute he goes to sleep ... their energy, you forget, at five years old, is phenomenal.'\n\nAdorable: Eric, five, looked adorable on his navy Real Madrid jersey and beige shorts cycling on his orange bike\n\nSimon previously said he'd named his diet the Eric Cowell diet after his son, because the youngster loves to munch on raw vegetables.\n\nHe said: 'It's like the Eric diet because he actually, apart from ice cream, he actually likes water.

So I'm on like, the Eric Cowell diet.'\n\nSimon recently appeared on Lorraine where his ex-girlfriend Terri Seymour grilled him about life as a dad to Eric and how his life has transformed.\n\nIn a touching sentiment, Simon admitted life is 'more simple and fun' since becoming a father, as he said: 'I see my life through his eyes now and it\u2019s much more simple and it\u2019s much more fun.'\n\nCelebrations: The outing looked like the perfect start to Simon's birthday celebrations as he's set to turn 60 on Monday\n\nWhen asked about what the biggest change has been in fatherhood, he said: 'When you become a dad, something clicks in you. It\u2019s all about them.\n\n'You become very protective and importantly, part of the reason I changed everything in my life'.\n\nOn other elements of his life that Eric has changed, Simon discussed his lifestyle overhaul which saw him shed the weight.\n\nAdditionally, he has stepped back his working duties too so as to ensure he can give Eric his very best and remain rested for their time together.\n\nHe said: 'I was like a vampire, I realised that I was going to sleep between 5 and 7 in the morning and then the trouble with that is, no matter if you get six hours, eight hours, you always wake up tired, that\u2019s the problem...\n\n'So along with the diet, I changed my hours so I go to sleep at 10pm and I now have breakfast at 8.30am. It\u2019s almost like a complete reversal.'", "description": "The talent show judge, 59, looked happier than ever as he cycled beside the boardwalk with Lauren's son Adam in a loose-fitting charcoal grey T-shirt and complementing shorts.", "authors": ["Lisa Mcloughlin For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/10/19356710-0-image-a-32_1570352773131.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
