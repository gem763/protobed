Before I could say anything, he was sitting on the floor of a store, yanking off one of his old tennis shoes and slipping on a tiger-colored cleat.\n\nIt fit slightly loose, but it didn\u2019t matter. It also didn\u2019t matter that, at 6, he had never played a real game of soccer.\n\nHe begged, and then he reasoned. Knowing that I rarely pay full price for any of our clothes anymore (most of what I wear now is secondhand, but that\u2019s a column for another day), he pointed out the price tag. It listed the shoes for $19.99, instead of the original $40.\n\nI surrendered. The cleats got tossed into our cart and later placed on top of a shoe rack in our garage.\n\nWhy am I telling you this? Because those size-1 cleats have come to symbolize for me the type of guilt that many parents in the Washington region carry in one form or another.\n\nMany months later, the tag is still on them. Every time I pass them, they mock me with their immaculateness and remind me how hard it is to parent in the DMV, where you can\u2019t simply sign your kid up for activities, you have to presign them up and then be quick on the day when the real sign-up occurs.\n\nYou have to predict what they\u2019ll want before they want it \u2014 and then be prepared to click and refresh, click and refresh.\n\nYou have to be a parenting ninja.\n\nI, of course, knew nothing about this bizarre side of Washington until I had my own kids, two boys who just entered kindergarten and second grade. For years, I lived in blissful, stress-free ignorance of what my co-workers and neighbors were going through to sign up for child care and backup child care and camps and beyond-school activities in this high-achieving region where available spots, especially for programs with strong reviews, can\u2019t often meet the demand.\n\n[A boy, a bug and a different kind of love story]\n\nThis week, hundreds of thousands of students started school in Maryland and Virginia. Those pictures of them holding signs declaring they are entering first or fifth or 10th grade are adorable achievement markers. I look forward to seeing them every year.\n\nBut for the first time, I found myself also thinking about the achievements of the parents behind those cameras. I found myself considering how much time and energy they spend throughout the year to give their children opportunities to excel in and out of school.\n\nI also found myself wondering whether they have their own cleats, something that has caused them to question whether they are doing enough.\n\nRachel Bailey, a family specialist in the Washington region who is raising two daughters in Northern Virginia, said she has seen how mothers and fathers, \u201cespecially in this area of well-educated, successful parents,\u201d put pressure on themselves and their children.\n\n\u201cAll of this is reinforced by the fact that there is a lot of comparison and judgment when it comes to parenting,\u201d said Bailey, who has a master\u2019s degree in clinical psychology. \u201cParents are talking to other parents about what their kids are involved in and what it takes to be successful. People aren\u2019t shy about giving their opinions because often insisting that they know what it takes to build a better future for their kids makes them feel more in control of the often-unpredictable job of parenting.\u201d\n\nShe teaches parents every day how to reduce that pressure. One strategy she calls \u201ctuning in, instead of tuning out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ask them to create an avatar of the type of parent they want to be, based on their values,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I ask them to use that avatar to be their North Star when it comes to making parenting decisions for their child. And when they see other parents doing different things \u2014 especially during these \u2018comparison\u2019 conversations or when scrolling on social media \u2014 I ask them to tune in to their avatar, to their inner voice, to their own morals and values, rather than using others\u2019 stories to determine the decisions they make for their children.\u201d\n\nTuning in, instead of tuning out. It\u2019s a helpful tool that many of us should probably keep close, especially because there will inevitably come moments when we\u2019re not fast enough at the keyboard or standing close enough to the front of the line.\n\nIt should go without saying that this type of parental angst is a luxury. Parents struggling to financially survive in this high-cost area have other worries. The homeless families living in hotels on New York Avenue NE, which I recently told you about, have to stress about how to get their children to and from school safely and on time.\n\n[Homeless children in hotels are struggling to get to school, a group learned. It now wants D.C. officials to consider: If tourists get shuttles, shouldn\u2019t they?]\n\nThe problems they and other struggling families in the region face deserve our attention, and more. They deserve resources and solutions. But we can help those children while also trying to figure out how best to take care of our own \u2014 and, in this area, many parents learn quickly how that comes with unique challenges.\n\nThe first time I realized parenting in the Washington area was going to be different from in other places, my firstborn was weeks old. I was on maternity leave and finally had time to start looking into day-care options. There was a day care I passed by every day as I walked to the Metro, and I assumed I could just call and arrange for him to get in.\n\nPresent-day me now laughs at postpartum me.\n\nWhen I called that day care, a kind woman who answered the phone told me I could pay $75 to be placed on a wait list and then whispered \u201cbut don\u2019t waste your money because you won\u2019t get in.\u201d Receptionists at other places also described limited space and told me that people often sign up before they even have children. The one day care that seemed the most promising, and which I did pay to consider my application, called to let me know that my son finally made it to the top of the wait list. By that time, he was 3 years old, and I had a second child.\n\nMore recently, my husband and I decided to sign our boys up for a summer camp that came highly recommended and was convenient for our commutes. We quickly learned that if we wanted them to have any chance of getting in, we needed to pay for a membership to the organization running the program and then stand in line, hoping the slots we wanted weren\u2019t all filled. An hour before the place opened, parents were already waiting, and many held detailed lists of their first options followed by their backup options followed by the backup options to their backup options.\n\nAfter my son expressed an interest in soccer, I looked up programs and realized I had missed a recent deadline. The next time the sign-up period opened, I filled out the online application in time but wasn\u2019t fast enough. He got wait-listed, and then rejected.\n\nFinally, a few weeks ago, another parent sent me an email telling me she had just signed her son up. I had flown 10 hours and was in a different time zone, but I dropped everything to do the same.\n\nThis time, he got in.\n\nOn Friday, he will finally put on those cleats and attend his first soccer practice. I hope he loves it, or at least doesn\u2019t despise it.\n\nMostly though, I hope his shoes still fit.", "description": "Rachel Bailey, a family specialist, offers a useful strategy for parents in the region who tend to put a lot of pressure on themselves and their children.", "authors": ["Theresa Vargas", "Local Columnist Who Previously Wrote For The Local Enterprise Team About Poverty", "Race", "People With Disabilities."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/WJya4ek31UkK2HGyooi_4NZ6-H4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HICT3FWPFUI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg"}
