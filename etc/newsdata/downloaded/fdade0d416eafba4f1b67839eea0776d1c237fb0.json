So when, after trying to cajole her out of bed for 10 minutes, she rolled over with pleading eyes and asked: \u201cCan I please just stay home today?\u201d I caved and said yes.\n\nShe rolled over and fell back asleep and slept for much of the day.\n\nI said yes because I knew that even though she wasn\u2019t obviously physically sick, mentally, she was under the weather.\n\nYou'll Also Love: Strategies For Parenting Kids Who Have Anxiety\n\nEver since then, I let all three of my kids take one day a year off from school if they want it \u2014 no questions asked.\n\nIn our house, we call them mental health days and they\u2019re an important part of our family life. It\u2019s a privilege, I know. I work from home so when my kids take a mental health day, I don\u2019t have to explain it to a boss or miss a day at the office.\n\nOur son loves school and has never taken his free pass, but our two daughters do every year because sometimes life just feels overwhelming \u2014 even for a child.\n\nThere\u2019s been plenty of media attention on the importance of acknowledging our mental health. The Canadian Mental Health Association launched a campaign a year ago, urging the Ontario government to fund mental health the way it does physical health. And mental health champions like Olympian Clara Hughes have shined a spotlight on mental health as an illness. Hughes has spoken out about her own struggles with depression since 2010. But she\u2019s not alone: One in five Canadians will personally experience a mental health problem or illness in any given year.\n\nAs a society, we don\u2019t sweep talk about mental health under the rug anymore. We acknowledge it. We tweet about it. We like and share articles or posts written by others who have faced mental illness. That\u2019s all been good progress.\n\nAt home, we talk to our kids about mental health as much as we can. Take care of your mind the way you do your body, we tell them. But more than talk, we need to act. As parents, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do when we let our kids take a mental health day from school.\n\nMore Recommended Reading: 5 Ways To Build Your Child's Resilience In An Anxious World\n\nWe push our kids to be their best. They do well in school. They participate in extracurricular activities. They help out at home. But we also want them to know that it\u2019s okay to not be okay. And if that means that after 10 minutes of cajoling, all they really want to do is stay in bed that day because they need to take a break from the world? Well, that\u2019s just fine with me, because in our house mental health is health.", "description": "I want my kids to know that if they need to take a break from the world every once in awhile, well, that\u2019s just fine with me.
