(AP) - While South Carolina players have enjoyed their big win over Georgia last week, the Gamecocks understand they need to build on success instead of reveling in it.\n\n\u201cYou go to sleep, you wake up and you realize you\u2019ve got another game to play,\u201d said Javon Kinlaw, who was named Southeastern Conference defensive lineman of the week for his performance against the then third-ranked Bulldogs.\n\nSouth Carolina (3-3, 2-2 Southeastern Conference) walked off the field with the signature win of coach Will Muschamp\u2019s four seasons in Columbia, a 20-17, double overtime victory last Saturday. The Gamecocks look to bring that same level of play against No. 9 Florida (6-1, 3-1) on Saturday.\n\nMuschamp wasn\u2019t shy this offseason, calling the Gamecocks the deepest and most talented group he\u2019s had since taking over as coach after the 2015 season. But the team stumbled out of the gates at 1-3 and carried a six-game losing streak against Power Five opponents into late September.\n\nThings took a positive turn with a 24-7 win over Kentucky on Sept. 28, then went to another level with the victory at Georgia - where the Gamecocks had not won since 2011.\n\nThe victory was confirmation, center Donnell Stanley said, that the team is heading in the right direction.\n\n\u201cWe see what we can do when we do all the right things, the small things,\u201d he said. \u201cLike we didn\u2019t do early on in the season.\u201d\n\nThe past couple of days have been a dizzying and distracting time for players, who\u2019ve been celebrated and cheered by friends, family and fans.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s happy now,\u201d linebacker Ernest Jones said with a wide smile.\n\nThe Gamecocks vow they\u2019ve put the celebrations behind them and are now fully locked in on Florida. The last time they beat two top-10 opponents was in 2013 - against No. 5 Missouri and No. 6 Clemson - the last of Steve Spurrier\u2019s three straight 11-2 teams. South Carolina is also looking for three consecutive SEC wins for the first time since 2017 and only the second time in Muschamp\u2019s tenure.\n\nFreshman quarterback Ryan Hilinski was on the sidelines icing his left knee and cheering on his teammates after a hard hit late in the third quarter that certainly looked serious. But Muschamp said Hilinski had a knee sprain and has moved around well at practice with the plan to start against the Gators, who lead the SEC with 26 sacks and 12 interceptions.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll be fine for Saturday,\u201d Muschamp said. \u201cHe wore a brace, but he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nMuschamp said his players have responded the way he hoped at practices this week following the Georgia win.\n\nHe told his players Tuesday morning that in life, \u201cyou generally get what you deserve.\u201d\n\nThe Gamecocks worked and prepared the right way to have a chance to take down the Bulldogs, Muschamp said. They\u2019ll need a similar work ethic if they want the chance to upset Florida.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to pour our guts into Florida,\u201d the coach said. \u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll create the opportunity to have the right to win on game day.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s defense has played well the past two games. Muschamp has decided to play more of a four-three alignment instead of using a nickel scheme with five defensive backs.\n\nThat\u2019s meant more playing time for linebacker Sharrod Greene, and he\u2019s responded with 10 tackles in the Gamecocks past two wins. Having Greene on the field has allowed South Carolina to play faster, Muschamp said.\n\nAlong with Kinlaw\u2019s conference award, safety Israel Mukuamu was named defensive player of the week for his three interceptions (one returned for a touchdown) off Georgia quarterback Jake Fromm.\n\nJones said it\u2019s been a blast the last few days with the excitement over the Georgia win, but that\u2019s in the books and it\u2019s time to look ahead.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re over that now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got more of the season left.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "While South Carolina players have enjoyed their big win over Georgia last week, the Gamecocks understand they need to build on success instead of reveling in it.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Pete Iacobelli"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/south_carolina_georgia_football_76548_c0-76-1830-1143_s1200x700.jpg?4314027fadb90ec1e2ba791081c9b9270c509271", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
