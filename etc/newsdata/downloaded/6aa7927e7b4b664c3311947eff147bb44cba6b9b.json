The bulk of the French drinks maker's operating profit comes from its premium-range cognac brands. The U.S. market accounts for about 35% of its sales according to a J.P. Morgan note from September, which estimated that if the U.S. imposed tariffs on its goods, its gross profit could take a hit of up to 10%.\n\nShares in premium drinks maker Pernod Ricard SA (RI.FR)--which owns the Martell cognac brand--and French luxury-goods group LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (MC.FR),owner of the high-end cognac label Hennessy, also rose at the open.\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative published late on Wednesday a list of European goods including French cheese, Spanish olives and other products that it plans to impose tariffs on after the World Trade Organization authorized levies on $7.5 billion of EU goods in its ruling on the block's subsidies to Airbus.\n\nAt GMT 0800, Remy Cointreau traded 6.1% higher, Pernod Ricard was up 3.5%, and LVMH traded 1.4% higher.\n\nWrite to Cristina Roca at cristina.roca@dowjones.com; @_cristinaroca\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 03, 2019 04:48 ET (08:48 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
