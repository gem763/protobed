They can even annotate data with notes of their own.\n\nDoorit Raines, a historian at the University of Venice, says it can a perfect service for tourists: they can use the app for research before their journey, and then share their own photographs for others to use afterwards.", "description": "A European project seeks to digitally read old documents to help recreate the continent's diverse history", "authors": ["Julian Gomez"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/40/08/1000x563_cmsv2_556bc965-b5f1-58f9-a124-417a29ec1bf3-4224008.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
