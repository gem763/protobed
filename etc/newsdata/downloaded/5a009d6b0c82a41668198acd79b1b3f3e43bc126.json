Think again.\n\nWith consumers on the prowl for easier ways to shop, manage their daily lives and pull up music and news (such as Yahoo Finance) on demand, the smart speaker industry is poised for its next major chapter of growth, according to new research from investment bank Credit Suisse.\n\nGlobal smart speaker units shipped will surge 67% this year to 164 million, Credit Suisse says. That\u2019s up markedly from 36 million units shipped in 2017 as consumers become more comfortable with using the devices and leaders Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Sonos (SONO) refresh their smart speaker lineup to spur sales.\n\nOverall, the global smart speaker market is expected to reach $23.3 billion by 2025 according to Allied Market Research. In 2017, that number was a mere $4.4 billion.\n\nIt almost goes without saying the introduction of more advanced smart speakers is unlocking new consumer behaviors and sales opportunities for the primary manufacturers.\n\n\u201cToday, consumers are primarily using speakers for music listening, though other applications include general information searches and weather, news and sports updates,\u201d writes Credit Suisse analyst Brian Russo. \u201cSurveys indicate that after purchasing a speaker, users are listening to more music, are searching for music in different ways than on smartphones (e.g., \u201cplay happy music\u201d), are listening more often with other people (living room and kitchen are primary locations for speakers, 53% of users say they listen with others most of the time), and are adopting music subscription services (1-in-5 consumers subscribed to a service for the first time after buying a speaker).\u201d\n\nThe ultimate winner\n\nRusso believes Amazon with its nifty Alexa-powered smart speakers is the ultimate winner from these behavioral shifts.\n\nAmazon holds a commanding 65% of the U.S. smart speaker market, Russo notes, well ahead of Google and Apple at 20% and 5%, respectively. The fact Amazon has its hardware in millions of homes (which is a sale, of course) means consumers are constantly interacting with the tech giant\u2019s digital ecosystem. And with that engagement comes opportunities for Amazon to cash in on everything from music downloads to grocery orders.\n\nAn Amazon Echo is displayed during a program announcing several new Amazon products by the company, in Seattle.
