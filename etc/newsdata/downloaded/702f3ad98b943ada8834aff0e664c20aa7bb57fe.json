REUTERS/Lee Jae-Won\n\nThe euro teetered near its lowest in more than two years versus the greenback as weak economic data from Germany reinforced expectations that monetary policy in the euro zone will remain accommodative for an extended period.\n\nThe Australian dollar edged lower before an expected interest rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) later on Tuesday.\n\nA host of economic data and comments from central bankers this week will set the tone for major currencies as traders try to determine how far policymakers go to bolster growth.\n\n\u201cEconomic data can be supportive of the dollar, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s comments are not as dovish as some people think,\u201d said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cAn RBA rate cut and the risk of a stagnant European economy both should be positive for the greenback.\u201d\n\nThe dollar traded at 107.85 yen JPY=EBS early in Asia, close to its strongest level in almost two weeks.\n\nThe yen remained weak after the Bank of Japan\u2019s tankan showed business confidence in the third quarter slid to its lowest in six years.\n\nTrading could be subdued in Asian time because China\u2019s financial markets are closed until Monday for public holidays.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY against a basket of six major currencies rose 0.03% to 99.402, approaching the highest in more than two years.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management\u2019s measure of U.S. manufacturing activity due later on Tuesday is forecast to show a return to expansion in September, but just barely.\n\nIn August U.S. manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in three years due to the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nSeveral Fed policymakers are scheduled to speak this week, but traders said they will focus most on comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday for hints about the direction of U.S. monetary policy.\n\nThe Fed has cut interest rates twice this year, but there are signs that the Fed is reluctant to ease policy further because the jobs market remains strong.\n\nThe euro stood at $1.0900 EUR=EBS in Asia, nursing a 0.4% decline in the previous session when it slid to $1.0885, which is the lowest since May 12, 2017.\n\nAnnual inflation in Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, slowed to the lowest in almost three years, data on Monday showed.\n\nThe European Central Bank unleashed a new round of monetary easing measures on Sept. 12, but there is growing concern that the central bank is reaching the limits of what it can achieve and the burden will fall to eurozone governments to boost fiscal spending.\n\nThe Australian dollar fetched $0.6751 AUD=D3, down 0.02% in early trade.\n\nAustralia\u2019s central bank is all but certain to cut its cash rate to a record low of 0.75% on Tuesday and will likely ease again in early 2020 to boost inflation and support a stuttering economy, a Reuters poll showed.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar traded at $0.6264 NZD=D3, which is within striking distance of a four-year low.
