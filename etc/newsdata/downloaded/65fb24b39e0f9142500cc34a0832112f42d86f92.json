This is not what justice looks like | Nathan Robinson", "language": "en", "text": "Democratic congresswoman Katie Hill has resigned after being accused of violating House Ethics rules by having a sexual relationship with staffers, and possibly using her position to grant improper favors. Members of her own party made it clear she did not have their support, with Nancy Pelosi saying that Hill \u201chas acknowledged errors in judgement that made her continued service as a member untenable.\u201d Hill\u2019s case may seem straightforward: she violated the rules, she abused her office, she has to go. But there\u2019s much more to it, and we should be disturbed at the speed with which Hill was forced out of office before completing a single term.\n\nHill is one of the first openly bisexual members of Congress, and at age 32 was considered a rising star among the freshman class. Earlier this month, conservative media website RedState began revealing details about Hill\u2019s sex life. Hill was alleged to have to been in a polyamorous relationship with both her husband and a female campaign staffer, as well as to have had an affair with her male legislative director. Hill acknowledged the relationship with the female staffer but denied having a relationship with the legislative director. Because the House of Representatives has a new, post-MeToo rule prohibiting sexual relations between members of Congress and staff, an investigation into Hill\u2019s potentially unethical sex life was announced.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable to look into allegations of relationships between congresspeople and staff. After all, the rule was put in place because of the disturbing power imbalances present in such situations, and the House certainly has to look into evidence that Hill may used her position to offer financial and employment rewards to those she was in relationships with. But the way details of Hill\u2019s sex life have been exposed, and Hill\u2019s claim that her career is being ended by a vindictive husband, should give us serious pause before jumping to conclusions.\n\nThe media did not only publish evidence that Hill violated ethics rules. It also published photographs of her naked body. The Daily Mail offered its readers \u201cshocking\u201d photos of Hill nude, saying that her \u201cwild lifestyle has been laid bare in a cache of texts and intimate photographs.\u201d (The wild lifestyle consists of being naked, kissing a woman, and possibly smoking marijuana.) The Mail did not name its source, but it appears likely to have been Hill\u2019s husband, whom she claims is trying to get revenge on her. The husband said in his divorce complaint that he was upset Hill wanted him to be a \u201chouse husband\u201d who stayed home and did chores.\n\nIt\u2019s outrageous that any newspaper would publish these kinds of photos. Imagine what it would feel like to wake up and find naked photographs of yourself printed and seen by millions; it\u2019s literally the stuff of nightmares. No wonder Katie Hill has vowed to use her post-Congressional career to fight \u201crevenge porn.\u201d The way Hill\u2019s sex life has been sensationalized into something lurid\u2014with headlines like \u201cswing district\u201d\u2014certainly makes public service a less appealing career. Who would want to serve in Congress knowing that their most intimate details could become public overnight?\n\nI do not take a position on whether or not Katie Hill violated House ethics rules. That\u2019s the entire purpose of having an adjudication procedure. If she did, she should be disciplined. That might not actually include pushing her out of Congress; my own position is that most decisions like that should be left up to voters. The prohibition on sexual relationships with staffers is new, and there is something disturbing about the fact that after untold numbers of men have had such relationships in Congressional history, the first person whose career will be ended by it is a young queer woman.\n\nA complicated question is raised by Hill\u2019s case: if it is the case that Hill violated ethics rules, but it is also the case that this violation only came to light as part of a campaign of revenge by her husband, should this affect whether Hill steps down? If men and women violate ethics rules at the same rates, but men are more likely to go public with accusations of ethics violations (because of what happens to female accusers), we might see women punished more often for misbehavior that occur with the same frequency across genders. In fact, it\u2019s unclear whether Hill\u2019s resignation is a just outcome even if the allegations against her are true\u2014one of the subordinates with whom she is accused of having a relationship says that all the staffers\u2019 lives have been ruined. These are the very people whose interests the rule is supposed to be protecting.\n\nEven if it is complicated by the fact that Hill might simultaneously be \u201cguilty\u201d and \u201cpersecuted,\u201d Hill\u2019s case should be clear in one respect: she should have had a greater opportunity to clear her name. Hill says that she is being victimized. That needs to be taken seriously. It\u2019s disappointing that Nancy Pelosi threw Hill under the bus, and women\u2019s groups seem reluctant to speak up for her, while Republican Matt Gaetz, of all people, says Hill \u201cisn\u2019t being investigated by Ethics or maligned because she hurt anyone \u2014 it is because she is different.\u201d\n\nThere are very clear elements of slut-shaming and homophobia in the Hill story, and Hill\u2019s resignation letter is deeply sad: she talks of the cruel toll that this \u201cappalling invasion of my privacy\u201d driven by a \u201cmonster [waging] a smear campaign\u201d is taking. I don\u2019t think anyone should feel as if justice is being done here, and elected officials like Hill should not be judged by conservative media campaigns but by a full investigation into the facts.", "description": "There are very clear elements of slut-shaming and homophobia in the Hill story, and her resignation letter is deeply sad", "authors": ["Nathan Robinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45dc037658fc8e61929c61c18e58b21d4ad1f6f0/0_0_4796_2879/master/4796.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=65a32c35459f990abb75cc31c01e5a76", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
