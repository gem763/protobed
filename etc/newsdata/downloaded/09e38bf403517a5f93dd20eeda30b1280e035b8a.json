The speech, written for the monarch by government officials, gives a brisk rundown of more than 20 laws Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s administration hopes to pass in the coming months.\n\nBut uncertainty around Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union due on Oct. 31 and the possibility of an early election makes it uncertain any of these measures will ever become law.\n\n___\n\n9:15 a.m.\n\nBritain is getting out an ornate royal carriage and a diamond-studded crown for the State Opening of Parliament, a mix of ceremony and politics overshadowed by the looming Brexit deadline.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II is due at Parliament to deliver a speech written by the government outlining its legislative plans.\n\nThis year\u2019s speech is surrounded by the uncertainty of Britain\u2019s delayed exit from the European Union. It is set to include a bill to ratify a withdrawal agreement with the EU - but no such agreement has yet been made.\n\nIt also includes sweeping domestic promises on law and order, health care and environmental protection that the government may never get to implement. Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservative administration lacks a majority in Parliament, and an election looks likely within the next few months, whether or not Britain leaves the EU as scheduled on Oct. 31.\n\n___\n\n9:15 a.m.\n\nGerman authorities say the country\u2019s exports to Britain dropped 4.6% in the first seven months of 2019 compared with a year earlier, continuing a downward trend since British voters chose to leave the European Union in 2016.\n\nThe Federal Statistical Office said Monday that Germany exported goods worth 47.1 billion euros ($52 billion) to the U.K. between January and July. British exports to Germany were worth 21.3 billion euros - a 3.7% decline in year-on-year terms.\n\nIn the January-July period, Britain was Germany\u2019s No. 7 trading partner overall. In 2015, the year before the Brexit referendum, it was No. 5. The statistics office said that German exports to Britain climbed steadily from 2010 to 2015 but then dropped. It said exports of cars and auto parts have declined strongly.\n\n___\n\n8:45 a.m.\n\nThe British government says it will deliver its annual budget on Nov. 6, a week after the country is due to leave the European Union.\n\nTreasury chief Sajid Javid said \u201cthe first budget after leaving the EU\u201d will set out \u201cour plan to shape the economy for the future.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear, however, whether the U.K. will leave the EU as scheduled on Oct. 31. Talks on a last-minute divorce deal are continuing, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the country will quit the bloc at the end of this month, with or without a withdrawal agreement.\n\nBut lawmakers in Parliament say the government must ask the EU to delay if a no-deal Brexit is the only other option.\n\nOpposition Labour Party finance spokesman John McDonnell called the budget announcement \u201can electioneering stunt.\u201d\n\n___\n\n7:20 a.m.\n\nIreland says that a Brexit deal may be possible in the coming days, after technical teams from Britain and the European Union worked through the weekend.\n\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said in Luxembourg that \u201ca deal is possible, and it is possible this month. May be possible this week. But we are not there yet.\u201d\n\nCoveney insisted it was essential to give the negotiators time to iron out the remaining difficulties which largely center on the border between Ireland and the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland.\n\nHe added that \u201cthere is still a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nEU leaders will meet on Thursday and Friday to see whether a deal is possible ahead of the Brexit deadline of Oct. 31.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on Brexit (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/aptopix_belgium_europe_brexit_59048_c0-173-5305-3267_s1200x700.jpg?e21f5f9919780a6abdcdf828e02f9357d7ac1f3a", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
