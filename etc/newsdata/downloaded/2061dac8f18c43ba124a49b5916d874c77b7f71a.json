Chiefly, that they were building a house for, air quotes, \u201cpeople like them.\u201d\n\nThe build up of frustration on the behalf of Mitch & Mark boiled over on Sunday night\u2019s episode, where they suggested the show\u2019s judges need to \u201cwalk away\u201d from whatever insinuation was being made about their work. Host Scott Cam, reading the judge\u2019s comments, barked that he personally didn\u2019t have to walk away from anything, despite Mitch & Mark quite calmly \u2013 all things considered \u2013 explaining why the commentary irked them.\n\nLast night, Cam dug his heels in after delivering a fairly obviously scripted non-apology apology to the duo, in which he explained that the \u201cpeople like you\u201d commentary referred to a vast array of personalities, actually, before offering an apology only if they were offended by it.\n\nBut it was the follow-up, where Cam bafflingly blew up over not receiving an apology from Mitch & Mark for whatever reason, leading to a walk out that Channel Nine (which this publication is owned by) used as a promotional hook all throughout Monday.\n\nCam, aggrieved by the fact that Mitch & Mark met his half-baked explanation with a legitimately gracious \u201cwe accept that, thank you,\u201d huffed and puffed his way through one of the strangest diatribes you\u2019re likely to see in any show about fixing up a big ass house.\n\nBy the way, some things were said during the week about my character, things were said about me, about my character, in regards to you guys, and I don\u2019t accept that. I was offended. And I [was] expecting you to say sorry once I explained it, but you didn\u2019t say sorry, you said \u201cthank you.\u201d So that\u2019s it.\n\nBaring in mind that not once during Cam\u2019s initial speech to Mitch & Mark did he actually say \u201csorry\u201d himself.\n\nUnsurprisingly, fans on social media tore that embarrassing display a new drain hole.\n\nJust so I understand Scott said sorry. Only to expect a sorry. And when he didn\u2019t get a sorry he became rude and arrogant. But ppl are like leave Scott alone he\u2019s a nice guy. #TheBlockAU pic.twitter.com/1E1T8UwAhb \u2014 ???????????????? ???????? ????????

(@justinaashman) September 9, 2019\n\nThroughout the entire segment, cherry-picked snippets from the past eight production weeks/twenty full episodes of TV were spliced in to bolster Cam\u2019s arguments against Mitch & Mark, demonising the couple and mounting a fairly blatant attempt to get the audience to side with the host over them.\n\n\u2018Course they didn\u2019t bother to include clips from the utterly insane moment that saw them, and only them, whisked away from The Block to meet Kylie Minogue in a throwaway moment that didn\u2019t get them any advantages or contribute to the show\u2019s narrative in any way.\n\nI still think the most homophobic thing on #TheBlockAU #TheBlock was having Mark and Mitch, be the only couple to meet Kylie Minogue \u2014 James (@JamesorusRex) September 9, 2019\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out why it was them \u2013 and not, say, Jesse & Mel or Andy & Deb \u2013 that got thrust into that segment.\n\nAnd yet it\u2019s the host in the high-vis that needs the apology after all this, of course.\n\nOf course it is.\n\nWhy would we expect anything else.", "description": "Host Scott Cam is again copping heat for his attempts at an apology over issues of stereotyping and homophobia on The Block.", "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/scott-cam-block.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
