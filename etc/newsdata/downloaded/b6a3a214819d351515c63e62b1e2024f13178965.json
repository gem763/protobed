Elizabeth Warren has called for the breakup of Facebook, specifically the divesting of Instagram, a sentiment shared by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, who published a New York Times op-ed claiming the deal should be \"unwound.\" Additionally, Facebook is facing investigations and probes from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice and 47 attorneys general related to antitrust issues.\n\nZuckerberg began his latest defense by highlighting the competitive environment Facebook was in before the deal took place. At the time, Instagram only had 13 employees supporting the app's 30 million users.\n\n\"In some ways we considered Instagram to be a competitor, but we have always thought that the better way to think about Instagram was that it was complementary to Facebook and what we're doing,\" Zuckerberg told analysts.\n\nHe's trying to make the point that whatever market strength Instagram now has is the result of the work that's taken place since Facebook acquired it.", "description": "Facebook's CEO said during Wednesday's earnings call that even with Instagram, the company faces stiff competition.", "authors": ["Salvador Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106200879-1571916187562rts2sjbi.jpg?v=1571916248", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
