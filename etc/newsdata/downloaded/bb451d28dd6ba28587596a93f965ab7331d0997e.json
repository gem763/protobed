But others demonstrating on Saturday remain angry that Britain is leaving the EU and want that reversed.\n\nHannah Barton, 56, a cider maker from Derbyshire in central England, was draped in the EU flag. \u201cWe feel that we are voiceless. This is a national disaster waiting to happen and it is going to destroy the economy,\u201d she said.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, backed a second referendum, saying \u201cthe people should have the final say\u201d.\n\nProtesters outside parliament cheered as lawmakers backed Letwin\u2019s amendment.\n\n\u2018SUPER SATURDAY\u2019\n\nBrexit \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d topped a frenetic week which saw Johnson confound his opponents by clinching a new Brexit deal with the EU.\n\nWhen it comes to a vote in a divided parliament where he has no majority, Johnson must win the support of 320 lawmakers to pass his deal.\n\nIf he wins, he will go down in history as the leader who delivered a Brexit \u2013 for good or bad \u2013 that pulls the United Kingdom far out of the EU\u2019s orbit.\n\nShould he fail, Johnson will face the humiliation of Brexit unraveling after repeatedly promising that he would get it done \u2013 \u201cdo or die\u201d \u2013 by Oct. 31.\n\nJohnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May was forced to delay the departure date. Parliament rejected her deal three times, by margins of between 58 and 230 votes, earlier this year.\n\nHe says lawmakers face the option of either approving the deal or propelling the United Kingdom to a disorderly no-deal exit that could divide the West, hurt global growth and bring renewed violence to Northern Ireland.\n\nTo win, Johnson must persuade enough Brexit-supporting rebels in both his Conservative Party and the Labour Party to back his deal. His Northern Irish allies and the three main opposition parties oppose it.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "A defiant Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would not negotiate a further delay to Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union after losing a vote in parliament on Saturday that means he is obliged to request a postponement.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/5d8bb9920a297.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
