Why did Donald Trump win your state by eight points? Because we got rid of 300,000 manufacturing jobs in your towns and [we're] not stopping there,\" he said.\n\nYang, a former lawyer who became wealthy as an entrepreneur, has made the threat of automation one of the centerpieces of his 2020 campaign. A big part of his platform centers on the \"freedom dividend,\" a $1,000 monthly paycheck that would go to every American adult.\n\n\"How many of you notice stores closing where you work and live here in Ohio? Raise your hands,\" he asked.\n\nA number of retailers across the country have been downsizing their footprint as shoppers abandon the mall and head online.\n\nMany of those retailers had overexpanded over the past decade which they are now retreating from as habits have changed and investment is needed in e-commerce. So far this year, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Party City, Pier 1 and Gap are among those that have announced store closures.\n\n\"It's not just you,\" Yang added. \"Amazon alone is closing 30% of America's stores and malls, soaking up $20 billion in business while paying zero in taxes.\"\n\nAn Amazon representative did not immediately return a request for comment.", "description": "\"How many of you notice stores closing where you work and live here in Ohio?
