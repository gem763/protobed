Why have you got so much stuff?\u201d\u2018\n\nScarlett admitted she thought the Himba people would be a fan of her family\u2019s digs, which had running water, WiFi and a washing machine, but they wanted it to be taken down.\n\nBritish Tribe Next Door airs tonight (Picture: Channel 4)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s such a sense of community there, going to get wood and cleaning, everything\u2019s done as a family and as a whole, whereas they found us very isolated,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s really changed our outlook. I thought we spent loads of time together, but being there made me realise that we don\u2019t and we could spend more time together.\u2019\n\nMany were angered at the news of Scarlett\u2019s series when it was first commissioned with some branding it \u2018racist\u2019.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve just found out that Scarlett Moffatt has an incredibly racist new series coming out called The British Tribe Next Door where they move her whole family to Africa in a house. You can\u2019t make this up,\u2019 one complained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, another wrote: \u2018I\u2019d love to know why you thought this would be a good idea? The whole concept is inherently racist and taking western privilege to a tribe in Africa, simply for the sake of TV is embarrassing.\u2019\n\nAlf Lawrie, Channel 4\u2019s head of factual entertainment, previously said of the show\u2019s commission: \u2018For the first time in human history, British suburbia and Himba tribal life will coexist side-by-side.\n\n\u2018This series contrasts two worlds on a spectacular scale \u2013 but at its heart, is about the extraordinary relationships it creates.\n\n\u2018Scarlett and the Himba are the perfect foils, both hospitable, curious, friendly\u2026 and sharing wicked sense of humour.\u2019\n\nThis Morning airs weekdays at 10.30am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
