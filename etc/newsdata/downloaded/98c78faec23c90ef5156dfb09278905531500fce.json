It\u2019s not native content, it\u2019s not cash-for-comment, it\u2019s not ad copy, it\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s a purely organic, dumb idiot idea for an article, the likes of which can only come deep into a Friday when the call of the froth rings loud. I wish it were an ad. If Macca\u2019s would like it to be an ad, it certainly can become one retroactively. I\u2019m very easily bought off via cash and/or burgers. If they wish to shower me with either I certainly won\u2019t say no.\n\nFor the bulk of my adolescent and adult life I\u2019ve been living a lie. That lie being that the Quarter Pounder \u2013 the heavyweight slugger \u2013 is the reigning and defending world champion of the McDonald\u2019s menu.\n\nIt\u2019s not. It\u2019s not even close.\n\nOnly recently have I had the self-realisation that I have been a fool, an ass, a buffoon, and a wrong one at that when it comes to standardised Drive Thru practices.\n\nThe real market leader, the one true King, is the Double Cheeseburger.\n\nREAD MORE Maccas Is Slinging Its First Ever Plant-Based Burger And Givvus It Now TBH\n\nUnlike its triple or singular compatriots, the Double Cheeseburger strikes a delicate balance no other burger on the menu comes close to achieving.\n\nThe cheese betwixt patties turns the otherwise nondescript cheeseburger into God-tier territory. Everything exists in pure harmony. The pickle, the sauce, the finely chopped onions. The Double Cheeseburger is a horny waltz with a toey god. And baby, he\u2019s here to jack off your tastebuds.\n\nThe Double Cheeseburger achieves what its cousins simply cannot. In its solo form the cheeseburger is more bread than filling. In triplicate, it\u2019s a precarious meaty Jenga tower, and I am a drunk baby with tubs for hands.\n\nIt solves every issue every other burger on the menu has: The Quarter Pounder that too often runs on the dry side, the Big Mac that forces you to wonder what the hell happens to those extra top bun halves, the Filet-O-Fish which is for serial killers only.\n\nThe Double Cheeseburger is king. It\u2019s not even a close contest.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s please pay me for this article.", "description": "The humble Double Cheeseburger is the one true king, the only king, the rule and lord, of all Macca's burgers.
