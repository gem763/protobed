Forty-five cameras are expected to be rolled out across the state in late 2019 and will include fixed and relocatable trailer-mounted cameras, according to the New South Wales government.\n\nThe technology encompasses two cameras, with one photographing the car\u2019s registration plate while another looks into the car's windshield to see if a driver is using their phone. The system, using artificial intelligence, will review the images and detect the illegal behavior while excluding drivers who are following the rules.\n\nIf a driver is detected using their phone, the image will be reviewed by authorized personnel before issuing warning letters, followed by a fine and demerit points on a license, according to the government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis comes as a growing number of countries, including the U.S., are deploying artificial intelligence to track citizens, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nAt least 75 countries, following China\u2019s lead, are actively using AI tools such as facial recognition for surveillance.\n\nPhoto captured by a Mobile Phone Detection Camera and released by Transport for NSW shows a driver using a mobile phone while driving in Australia.(Transport for NSW via AP)\n\nNSW tested the world's first mobile phone detection camera technology between January and June of this year. During the six-month pilot period, the cameras checked more than 8.5 million cars and detected more than 100,000 drivers illegally using their phones, according to statistics obtained by the government.\n\nOne driver was caught using his phone and iPad simultaneously, according to the government\u2019s test trial.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe issue of distracted driving has deluged more than just New South Wales. According to the CDC, distracted driving in the United States alone kills approximately nine people each day and more than 1,000 injuries are reported in crashes involving distracted drivers.\n\nThe CDC bolstered their point that sending or reading a text message can be the most dangerous distraction as it causes drivers to take their eyes off the road for about five seconds, which is long enough to cover a football field.", "description": "At least 75 countries, following China\u2019s lead, are actively using AI tools such as facial recognition for surveillance.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/driver-app-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
