It cannot bluff its way past. Voters are not buying it,\" he told AFP.\n\nModi is under mounting pressure to kickstart the economy, which has endured five consecutive quarters of slowing growth, causing India to lose its status as the fastest-growing major economy to China.\n\nThe slump has hit automakers particularly hard, with sagging demand forcing companies to halt production, slash prices and cut jobs in a once-booming industry that employs millions, including at major plants in Haryana and Maharashtra.\n\nExit polls had predicted wins for the BJP, but said the party would have to depend on its allies to form a majority and establish a coalition government in both states.\n\nA return to power by the BJP -- even as part of a coalition -- would be yet another blow to the Congress party, which has struggled to strike a chord with frustrated voters after dominating Indian politics for decades.", "description": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalists faced mixed fortunes in two Indian state elections, with his party on course to see reduced majorities as a grinding economic slowdown weighed on voters.
