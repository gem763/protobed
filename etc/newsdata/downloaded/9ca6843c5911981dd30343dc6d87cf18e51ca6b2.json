Priced at $30.00, the t-shirt is available for pre-order to begin shipping on October 29th.\n\n.\u2066@JoeBiden\u2069 campaign now selling \u201cBeat Him Like a Drum\u201d t-shirts. pic.twitter.com/Cs2zml5ToP \u2014 Ken Thomas (@KThomasDC) October 18, 2019\n\nBiden first used the phrase in late September when he snapped at a reporter who asked about President Donald Trump suggesting Ukraine look into allegations of corruption against him and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201cI know Trump deserves to be investigated. He\u2019s violating every basic norm of a president,\u201d Biden told Fox News Channel correspondent Peter Doocy.\n\n\u201cYou should be asking him the question, why is he on the phone with a foreign leader trying to intimidate a foreign leader,\u201d the former vice president continued. \u201cTrump is doing this because he knows I will beat him like a drum. He\u2019s using abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAsk the right questions,\u201d he then demanded of Doocy.\n\nDuring Tuesday evening\u2019s Democrat presidential debate, Biden once again made the pledge to beat President Trump \u201clike a drum\u201d while defending Hunter against accusations of nepotism and corruption related to his son\u2019s work in Ukraine and China.\n\n\u201cMy son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe president and his thugs are lying. He doesn\u2019t want me to be the candidate. If I\u2019m the candidate, he knows I will beat him like a drum.\u201d\n\nWhile the t-shirt demonstrates the Biden campaign is confident it will win the Democrat party, it still has to fend off the insurgent campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who is leading the former vice president in several statewide polls.\n\nAlthough the Biden has latched onto the phrase, it appears Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) used it in 2016 when (erroneously) predicting what then-Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton would do to then-candidate Trump in the general election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d hold my nose and vote for him but we\u2019d get killed. Hillary Clinton would beat him like a drum,\u201d he told CNN.", "description": "Joe Biden's campaign is now selling t-shirts with the phrase \"beat him like a drum\"\u00a0\u2014 something the he has vowed to do to Trump in 2020.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1176406477-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
