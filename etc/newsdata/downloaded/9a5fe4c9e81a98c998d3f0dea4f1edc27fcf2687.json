Now that we have abandoned them, they have no choice but to fight and defend themselves. Those prisoners are either going to be released or escape,\" she said. \"That's more than 10,000 fighters that can threaten us in the region, can threaten us through our partners in Europe or can potentially threaten us here in the homeland. The president has traded our national security for -- I would like to know what.\"\n\nShe came on the show to promote her new memoir, \"Tough Love: My Story of the Things Worth Fighting For,\" which gives a candid look into her public service career and the lessons she said she learned through the triumphs and tribulations. In one controversy, Rice was heavily scrutinized for reading from an intelligence community memo in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nGetty Images, FILE\n\nIn another, Trump accused Rice of committing a crime in 2017 when she had the names of Americans -- who turned out to be Trump's associates -- unmasked in a classified foreign intelligence report. The president did not offer any evidence for his claim that Rice's actions were criminal, and she has repeatedly said the unmasking process was routine and not politically motivated.\n\nRice was also a player in the Obama administration's policy decision to get involved in Syria, one she said she didn't fully support.\n\n\"As I write in my book 'Tough Love,' I was the one official sitting at the table, the one cabinet official who thought it was a mistake to ask Congress for authorization before using force in Syria. So I was a lone, dissenting voice. As I look back and reflect, I was right about the politics,\" she said on the show. \"I didn't think that President Obama would be granted support from Congress, and he wasn't, but I think I was wrong about the policy.\"\n\nNicolette Cain/ABC\n\nThe show's co-host Meghan McCain claimed Obama too was a hands-off president when it came to the region. McCain questioned Rice's defense of the decision to provide support to the rebels, but not boots on the ground, during the Syrian civil war.\n\n\"It was (Obama) who initiated the fight against ISIS which has been successfully prosecuted,\" she said. \"We can debate for years the wisdom of that choice. He made the right choice, I think we all agree, to go fight ISIS, and now what's happened is President Trump has decided on a whim that we're done with that.\u201d", "description": "Former national security adviser Susan Rice told", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/susan-rice-1-abc-ps-191009_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
