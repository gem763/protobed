In the phone call between the two world leaders, Mr. Trump pressed Ukrainian Mr. Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. That has led to an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats. The president maintains he has done nothing wrong.\n\nFor the week, the Dow is down 0.2%. The Ukraine stock market, on the other hand, is having a better week. The Ukraine PFTS Index rose 0.3% Thursday, its third straight daily gain and is up 0.5% for the week.\n\nApparently, it\u2019s always nice to be talked about.\n\nOf course, the Ukraine index has only seven stocks, with an aggregate market capitalization of $1.7 billion. The Dow has 30 stocks, with an aggregate market value of more than $7.5 trillion. It is difficult for global investors to find a market as deep and as tradable as U.S. equities.\n\nFor the year, the Ukraine index is down about 4%. The PFTS Index is actually up about 9% in U.S. dollar terms. Ukraine\u2019s currency, the Hryvnia, has strengthened by about 15% against the dollar in 2019. Still, that is short of the 17% gain of the Dow over the same span.\n\nWrite to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com", "description": "Investors spent the day digesting a whistleblower report that raised questions about the appropriateness of a conversation between President Donald Trump and Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky.", "authors": ["Al Root"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-72090/social", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
