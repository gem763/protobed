Six other people are also on trial for related charges.\n\nLawyer Thibault de Montbrial, representing French police and a terrorism victims association, described Monday's action in court as the first significant trial related to the 2015-2016 attacks in France, which deeply shook the country and hardened its security posture.\n\nHe said the trial also \"puts in the forefront the role, often unknown, underestimated and sometimes even negated by some, of women in radicalization, fanaticism, and their ability to execute a terrorist act.\"\n\nInes Madani, now 22, is considered the key player. She was just a teenager when she and Ornella Gilligmann joined a channel on the social network Telegram run by French jihadist Rachid Kassim, according to court documents.\n\nKassim was central to French recruiting efforts for IS, prosecutors say, and was believed linked to a gruesome attack on a French priest inside his Normandy church and the killing of a French police couple at home in front of their child. Kassim moved to Syria in 2015, and during the summer of 2016 he multiplied his threats against France on social networks and released a guide detailing how followers should commit attacks. Among his suggested methods were group stabbings or \"filling a vehicle with gas cylinders and spraying them with fuel.\"\n\nMadani and Gilligmann tried to do just that, after sending Kassim videos pledging allegiance to IS, court documents say.\n\nOn Sept. 4, 2016, they parked a Peugeot carrying six gas canisters near Notre Dame, doused them with diesel fuel and tried to set them alight. But they failed, and then fled.\n\nPolice quickly found their trail. The car belonged to Madani's father, and the two women's fingerprints and DNA were found on the gas canisters.\n\nGilligmann, who was already known to intelligence services for trying to reach Syria in 2014, was arrested two days later in southern France.\n\nMadani then tried to plot a new attack with help from Kassim and other women extremists. On Sept. 8, three of them took kitchen knives and attempted a rampage as police closed in.\n\nMadani \"acknowledges responsibility\" for plotting the Notre Dame attack and is expecting a conviction, her lawyer Laurent Pasquet Marinacce told The Associated Press. The lawyer said Madani was manipulated by Kassim and is \"no longer radicalized at all. She has done a lot of self-examination.\"\n\nKassim is being tried in absentia. An international arrest warrant was issued for him, but he was believed killed by a drone strike in 2017 around the Iraqi city of Mosul. U.S. authorities confirmed his death, but no proof of death was officially reported to the French courts.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMasha Macpherson in Paris contributed.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
