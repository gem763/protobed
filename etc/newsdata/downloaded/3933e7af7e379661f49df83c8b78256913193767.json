Reyes said, adding that authorities \u201chave no interest in interfering with adoptions that have already taken place.\u201d\n\nCatholic Charity Ends Adoptions Rather Than Place Kid With Same-Sex Couple\n\nPetersen, an adoption lawyer who is licensed in Arizona and Utah, was also hit with charges in Arizona, including conspiracy and theft, according to a Tuesday indictment filed by the state\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office. He was arrested in California, officials said.\n\nProsecutors allege Petersen \u201crecruited\u201d and transported more than 40 pregnant women from the Republic of the Marshall Islands\u2014a country of islands between Hawaii and the Philippines\u2014to Utah over the last three years. Reyes said Peterson first established a connection with the Marshall Islands through The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nAfter the children were born, Petersen allegedly offered the women money to give their babies up to U.S. parents and allegedly charged $40,000 per adoption, according to the indictment. The elected GOP official allegedly failed to disclose the scheme to his adoptive parent clients.\n\nMARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE More\n\nArizona and Utah investigators said Wednesday they believe at least 29 babies, some of whom were brought to other states to be adopted, are victims of the scheme.\n\nReyes added Utah authorities were first alerted to the scheme after concerned hospital workers and adoption lawyers called a human trafficking tip line. On Tuesday evening, Arizona authorities executed search warrants in multiple locations and found eight pregnant women from the Marshall Islands inside a Mesa home. It is not immediately clear what connection Petersen has to the property.\n\nBody of Slain University of Utah Student Mackenzie Lueck Was Found Bound in Shallow Grave\n\n\u201cWe are thinking of the birth mothers, adoptive families and children in this case as victims,\u201d Reyes said, adding that Petersen\u2019s alleged scheme \u201cexploited highly vulnerable groups in two countries\u2014the birth mothers and families in the Marshall Islands and the adoptive parents here in Utah.\u201d\n\nThe 32-count indictment filed in the Superior Court of Arizona alleges Petersen and his colleague, Lynwood Jennet, also organized travel for \u201cpregnant women from the Republic of the Marshall Islands to come to Arizona for the purpose of giving a child up for adoption.\u201d\n\nProsecutors say Petersen claimed these women as Arizona residents in order to receive medical services from the state\u2019s Medicaid system.\n\n\u201cAfter the birth of the child, Paul D. Petersen and Lynwood Jennett facilitated travel for these women to leave Arizona,\u201d the indictment alleges. \u201cIn several instances the women returned directly to the [Republic of the Marshall Islands].\u201d\n\nPaul Caneiro Charged With Murder After Allegedly Burning Down His Brother\u2019s Family Mansion\n\nThe scheme also allegedly violated the 1983 compact with the Republic of the Marshall Islands that prevents the island\u2019s citizens from coming to the U.S. \u201cfor the purpose of adoption\u201d unless they have a special visa.\n\nArizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich emphasized in a press conference Wednesday that the families who fell victim to the alleged scheme are not being investigated.\n\n\u201cThese adoptions are not in jeopardy. Our focus is on the individuals who facilitated these adoptions,\u201d Brnovich said.", "description": "The Daily BeastAn Arizona official faces charges in two states for his alleged role in an international adoption fraud scheme that involved smuggling pregnant women into the U.S. from the Marshall Islands, and then paying them to give up their babies, according to court documents.Maricopa County Assessor", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fACkXJWu0g6x0npz6oueRw--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/1216e4a2364944cb7c5bf713bdbfbf21", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
