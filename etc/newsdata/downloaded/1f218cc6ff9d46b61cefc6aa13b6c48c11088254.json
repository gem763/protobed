She's different than everybody up there. She sounds like in many ways a traditional liberal. She's not a hard leftist. She's not into identity politics. She thinks her own way and that bothers her [Clinton].\"\n\nHILLARY CLINTON FLOATS CONSPIRACY THAT TULSI GABBARD IS BEING 'GROOMED' BY RUSSIANS\n\nClinton floated the conspiracy theory that the Russians are \u201cgrooming\u201d Gabbard on former Obama aide David Plouffe\u2019s \u201cCampaign HQ\u201d podcast. Clinton did not mention Gabbard specifically, but Plouffe ended the podcast by noting Clinton\u2019s \u201cbelief that Tulsi Gabbard is going to be a third-party candidate propped up by Trump and the Russians.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm not making any predictions but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,\u201d Clinton said, an apparent reference to Gabbard. \u201cShe's the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d\n\nOther Democrats have made similar claims about Gabbard, a Hawaii Democratic congresswoman and Hawaii Army National Guard major who served in Iraq.\n\nGabbard responded to Clinton in a fiery three-part tweet Friday.\n\n\"Great! Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain,\" Gabbard tweeted. \"From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation.\"\n\nGutfeld used sarcasm to debunk Clinton's accusation.\n\n\"But maybe Hillary's right. I mean, if you think about it, you know, here you have Putin is grooming a Russian spy first to join the American military, right? Then after that, Russian spies in the military. Then you run for Congress, OK, in Hawaii,\" Gutfeld said. \"And then you decide to run for president as a Democrat, only to leave and then go independent in order to ensure that Donald Trump is president. The Russians must have been genius to predict that Trump would be president in 2020, to pull this off.\"\n\n\"The Greg Gutfeld Show\" host added, \"She [Clinton] is so delusional. It's comical.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' Vandana Rambaran and Alex Pappas ccontributed to this report.", "description": "Greg Gutfeld poked holes Friday in former Secretary of State\u00a0Hillary Clinton's accusation that Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard is a \"favorite\" of the Russians who are\u00a0preparing her for a third-party run in the general elections.", "authors": ["Victor Garcia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Hillary-Clinton-Tulsi-Gabbard-Reuters-AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
