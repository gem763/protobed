Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, a day after President Donald Trump demeaned him as \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general\u201d during a contentious White House meeting with members of Congress.\n\nThe meeting was intended to be a bipartisan discussion of Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. forces from northern Syria, but it broke up after a testy exchange between Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nBefore the walkout, Trump disparaged Mattis, who had argued as defense secretary that U.S. troops were needed in Syria to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State fighters.\n\nTrump said Mattis \u201cwasn\u2019t tough enough,\u201d and went on to say, \u201cI captured ISIS.\u201d\n\nThe retired Marine general Mattis resigned as defense secretary last December in a military policy dispute with Trump.\n\nMattis joked Thursday that the \u201coverrated general\u201d label didn\u2019t bother him because he \u201cearned his spurs on the battlefield,\u201d while Trump \u201cearned his spurs in a letter from a doctor.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to have U.S. troops stand down in Syria cleared the way for Turkey to launch an offensive against Kurdish forces in northern Syria who had been U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State. On Thursday, the U.S. and Turkey agreed to a five-day cease-fire that requires the Kurdish fighters to vacate, largely solidifying Turkey\u2019s position in the region.\n\nThe annual roast, hosted by New York Archbishop Cardinal Timothy Dolan, draws luminaries from finance and politics. It\u2019s named after a former New York governor who was the first Catholic to receive a major party nomination for president when he unsuccessfully ran in 1928. It benefits a charitable foundation.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Former Defense Secretary James Mattis hit back at his old boss at a white-tie gala in New York, saying that he's not just an overrated general, he's the greatest overrated general.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/alfred_smith_dinner_90632_c0-144-3467-2166_s1200x700.jpg?8c449c11bc1da19dc0155ddb1d4786aafb369181", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
