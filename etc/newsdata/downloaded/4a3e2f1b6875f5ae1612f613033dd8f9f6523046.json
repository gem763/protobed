Literally.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke, the former El Paso congressman, and Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio, will stand side by side in Houston on the far end of the debate stage, a reflection of their low standing in presidential polls.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a muted homecoming for the state\u2019s prized Democratic prospects, both of whom entered the primary accompanied by high expectations but have since failed to build momentum.\n\n\u201cI really like the guys. I mean, they\u2019re terrific,\u201d said Mike Collier, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in Texas in 2018 and endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday. \u201cBut the presidency is the most important job in the world, and there are an awful lot of Texans who view it the way I view it, which is that we want somebody who\u2019s a seasoned hand.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke, who eclipsed Castro last year during his near-miss Senate run against Republican Ted Cruz, has had the more humbling experience. He entered the race in March amid much fanfare only to see his campaign fade. Castro, the only Latino candidate in the sprawling field, is still struggling to break out of the low single digits in polls.\n\nBoth find themselves in essentially the same position in the debate: high enough in polling and fundraising to qualify for the debates, but in desperate need of a breakout moment.\n\n\u201cI thought either or both of them could gain traction nationally, and I certainly thought that traction that they gained nationally would have put them in position to take the best advantage of a homecoming debate,\u201d said Chris Lippincott, an Austin-based consultant who ran a super PAC opposing Cruz in the Senate race.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Recent shootings in Odessa, Midland and El Paso \u2014 O\u2019Rourke\u2019s hometown \u2014 offer an opportunity to talk about gun safety in personal terms. The border state\u2019s demography and experience with immigration issues provide an opening to seize on a hot-button campaign issue that both candidates are uniquely qualified to speak about.\n\n\u201cI think both the Texans are at least potentially in a pretty good position to be able to capitalize on whatever opportunities may come their way on Thursday night because [the debate] is in Texas and there\u2019s some built-in enthusiasm for the hometown team and because both of these guys are pretty quick thinkers on their feet,\u201d said Harold Cook, a Democratic consultant in Texas. \u201cThey at least have the capacity to jump into a void if one appears.\u201d\n\nThe Houston debate will mark the first time the two Texans will share a stage since Castro memorably castigated O\u2019Rourke over immigration policy in the June debate in Miami, an encounter that suggested a frosty relationship.\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O'Rourke. | Paul Sancya\n\nThat confrontation came on the heels of several other passive-aggressive moves between the hopefuls that have captured attention. Castro\u2019s campaign sent out a news release of his Texas endorsements on the same morning O\u2019Rourke launched his candidacy; O\u2019Rourke\u2019s team once sent out a press release pointedly boasting of a 25-point polling lead over \u201cfellow Texan\u201d Castro in the Lone Star State.\n\nGilberto Hinojosa, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, downplayed any friction between the two as a \u201csibling rivalry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t normally get into a competitive situation because they live in totally different parts of the state and they\u2019ve followed different paths towards where they\u2019re headed in terms of their political careers,\u201d Hinojosa said.\n\nNeither is dominant in their home state: Biden narrowly edges out O\u2019Rourke for the most support in Texas, according to a Univision poll released Tuesday, with Biden leading with 20 percent support to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s 19 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders is third with 13 percent support, and Castro and Sen. Elizabeth Warren are tied at fourth at 12 percent.\n\nA University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll released Wednesday showed Biden as the clear front-runner in Texas with support from 26 percent of potential Democratic primary voters, followed by Warren with 18 percent, O\u2019Rourke with 14 percent, and Sanders with 12 percent. Castro finished near the bottom with 3 percent.\n\nWith both O\u2019Rourke and Castro struggling to break through in national polls, there appears to be little incentive for either O\u2019Rourke or Castro to skirmish on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThey can fight each other over a scrap, or they can go after one of the big dogs for the whole steak,\u201d said Colin Strother, a veteran Democratic strategist in Texas. \u201cIt makes far more sense for them to tag team and go after Bernie [Sanders] or Warren or Biden and try to make a significant dent.\u201d\n\nStill, Strother said: \u201cI don\u2019t see them in fundamentally poor positions \u2026 I still think there\u2019s plenty of time for anyone to catch fire.\u201d\n\n", "description": "\"They can fight each other over a scrap, or they can go after one of the big dogs for the whole steak.\"", "authors": ["Nolan D.
