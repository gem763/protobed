As you can see, it seems to work, producing great shots.\n\nThe camera sensor itself has also got an overhaul, with deeper and larger pixels for improved color fidelity and better low-light photos.\n\nCombined, this allows Apple to do some pretty smart stuff, such as Smart HDR, which takes multiple pictures, analyzes all the photos, selects the best portions of each, and then combines them to create an optimal version of what you\u2019re trying to capture.\n\nThe camera is incredibly impressive, and Apple talks about it using the incredible power of the firm's chips to carry out 'computational photography'.\n\nTHE IPHONE XR: A SUPERB PHONE IN A SMALLER SIZE While much of this review focuses on the Max version of the XS, there is of course also the smaller 5.8inch screen version. Apart from the screen size, its almost identical, and is perfect for those who don't want the eyeball blowing 6.5inch screen of the Max. It's the same stunning screen, processor and camera updates, just in a smaller package, and while it may be tough for owners of the X to justify an upgrade, those who held off as the X was so new and different from previous phones can rest assured that while the X was a great phone, the XS really has had every flaw removed.\n\nWhat this means is that anyone with no photography skill whatsoever, such as myself, can create stunning shots easily using new features such as an update to the popular portrait mode.\n\nKnown as bokeh, this lets you change the depth of field after you've shot your picture, with incredible results.\n\nIt's highly intuitive to use with a slider, and great fun - and a perfect example of just how Apple can improve photography.\n\nThere\u2019s also faster Face ID, wider stereo sound, that new gold finish, and for the first time, dual SIM capabilities (although they won\u2019t be available until later this year).\n\nThe camera on the XS has received a big boost, and its stunning - particularly in low light conditions. Pictured, a sunset in San Francisco.\n\nFrom a hugely updated processor, to an updated camera and terrifying loud speakers, everything about the XS feels faster, snappier and better thought out than in any previous iPhone.\n\nPart of this is also, of course, down to software, and Apple\u2019s decision with iOS 12 to focus on performance and reliability over flashy new features has paid dividends.\n\nThis is the most solid, reliable version of iOS I\u2019ve ever used, and for owners of older handsets, downloading it really is a no brainer - you\u2019ll see everything from battery life to the general speed of your phone, even in older models, increase.\n\nThe camera on the XS has recieved a big boost, and its stunning - particularly in low light conditions.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s on the XS where iOS is really blazingly fast.\n\nWhereas even on the iPhone X, tasks like FaceID, complex games and even portrait mode in photos could feel a little sluggish, on the Xs they are blazingly fast.\n\niPhone XR vs iPhone XS vs XS Max Screen Size: Display Type: Processor: Water Resistance: Battery Life: Fast Charge: Wireless Charge: 3D Touch Display: Dual Cameras: Optical Zoom: FaceID: Weight: Software: Price: Colours: iPhone XR 6.1-inch LCD A12 Bionic IP67 Up to 15 hours Yes Yes No No No Yes 194g (6.84 oz) iOS 12 $749 (\u00a3749) Yellow, White, Coral, Black, Blue, and Product Red iPhone XS 5.8-inch OLED A12 Bionic IP68 Up to 12 hours Yes Yes Yes Dual 12MP Lens Yes. 2x Yes 177g (6.24oz) iOS 12 $999 (\u00a3999) Gold, Space Grey, Silver iPhone XS Max 6.5-inch OLED A12 Bionic IP68 Up to 13 hours Yes Yes Yes Dual 12MP Lens Yes. 2x Yes 208g (7.34 oz) iOS 12 $1099 (\u00a31099) Gold, Space Grey, Silver\n\nFaceID feels dramatically faster, and although I've only been using the phone for a few days, I can say it has been improved significantly - even first thing in the morning, where previously I\u2019d struggle, seems more reliable (apparently I\u2019m not a morning person even when it comes to facial recognition).\n\nApple also revealed the iPhone will support dual SIM cards for the first time.\n\nIt will use Apple\u2019s eSIM, a built in electronic sim card that works alongside the primary sim card, and Apple said it will be available later this year.\n\nThe Max really is the biggest iPhone Apple has ever made\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to get away from the screen.\n\nThe curved design means that in the flesh, it\u2019s incredibly easy to pick up and handle - and absolutely stunning to look at.\n\nThat screen is sharp and incredibly bright, and the phone (and even the still present notch) are almost invisible, making this the closest thing yet to Apple\u2019s \u2018all screen\u2019 vision.\n\nWhile many users liked the smaller size of the iPhone X when it was released last year, the Max does the seemingly impossibly - making a big screen phone that really doesn\u2019t feel like a big screen phone.\n\nPicking up the handset is a real \u2018oh\u2019 moment - by making almost the entire front of the phone screen, Apple has crammed that giant screen into a handset the same size as the previous \u2018Plus\u2019 model, by stretching the LED screen to the edge of the device.\n\nIt\u2019s big enough that you feel you could actually do far more, with emails and documents given a whole new lease of life (and infringing on the iPad a little, I would imagine).\n\nSo should you upgrade? Well, if you held off buying the X, and are a plus user, then absolutely.\n\nThe iPhone XS Max is probably the handset users of the Plus iPhones have been waiting for - and the extra screen real estate really does make this a phone that manages to balance a big screen with the usability and great feel iPhones are known for.\n\nThe smaller iPhone XS is a more complicated story, especially if you bought the X last year.\n\nThe updates to the camera, processor and other hardware are great - but by upgrading to iOS 12 you\u2019ll see a performance boost to your existing handset that may well make it worth holding off - unless, like many people who bought the X, you absolutely have to have the latest and greatest.\n\nFor those on a budget, there\u2019s also the complication of the cheaper, LCD screen iPhone Xr coming out\n\nOverall, this is absolutely the best iPhone Apple has even made - but for $1099 you\u2019d expect that.\n\nFor many, the Max is the iPhone they've been waiting for, and expect it to be a massive hit - and leave its smaller brother in the dust.", "description": "Apple's new iPhone XS and XS Max go on sale on Friday - and the biggest handset Apple has ever made is also its best (and possibly unsurprisingly, its most expensive).", "authors": ["Mark Prigg For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/17/22/50187CA400000578-0-image-a-7_1537221110726.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-18"}
