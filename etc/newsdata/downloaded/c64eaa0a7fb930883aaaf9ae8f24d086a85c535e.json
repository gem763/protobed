The court has said that in those circumstances its contempt jurisdiction might be engaged.\u2019\n\nThe PM is currently trying to renegotiate his predecessor Theresa May\u2019s deal and make changes to the Irish backstop issue.\n\nOfficials in Europe say they are open to talking but so far they are \u2018unconvinced\u2019 by Mr Johnson\u2019s new ideas.\n\nThe Prime Minister claims he has made a \u2018genuine attempt to bridge the chasm\u2019 with the European Union by making compromises.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said his Brexit plan \u2018falls short in a number of aspects\u2019 while Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said: \u2018If that is the final proposal, there will be no deal.\u2019\n\nThe revelations in Edinburgh this afternoon give Mr Johnson just 15 days to get a deal or subject the UK to further limbo.\n\nAll 27 leaders would have to agree to an extension and they could put conditions on it, including making the delay longer than three months.\n\nThe EU referendum was held in June 2016 in which the public decided by a margin of 52% to 48% to leave the bloc.\n\nIf a deal cannot be reached soon, the earliest we would leave would be the end of January 2020.\n\nThe Court of Session is the highest court in Scotland and last month it ruled that Mr Johnson\u2019s suspension of Parliament was unlawful.\n\nThat decision was upheld by the Supreme Court in London days later.\n\nThis is breaking and will be updated.", "description": "Boris Johnson will ask for a Brexit extension if he has not reached a deal by October 19, a court has been told.
