HuffPost could not independently confirm the considerations.\n\nThe alleged discussions represent a growing divide and lack of trust between parties in the House as the chamber\u2019s Foreign Affairs, Oversight and Intelligence committees investigate Trump\u2019s actions pressuring Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son while the president withheld nearly $400 million in approved U.S. military aid to the country.\n\nThe committee investigations are part of the impeachment inquiry, which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Sept. 24 after reports surfaced of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and a summary of Trump\u2019s July 25 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was released by the White House that corroborated the whistleblower\u2019s report.\n\nThe Post\u2019s report about potential steps to mask the whistleblower\u2019s identity comes a day after 90 former national security officials who served under both Democratic and Republican presidents signed an open letter defending the whistleblower and stressing the necessity of protecting the individual\u2019s identity.\n\n\u201cWhatever one\u2019s view of the matters discussed in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, all Americans should be united in demanding that all branches of our government and all outlets of our media protect this whistleblower and his or her identity,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cSimply put, he or she has done what our law demands; now he or she deserves our protection.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s attorneys have also voiced concern for their client\u2019s safety, specifically after Trump falsely accused the individual of \u201ctreason\u201d despite the whistleblower going through the appropriate channels to relay concerns. The president made veiled threats that the whistleblower should be \u201cdealt with\u201d in violent ways and has repeatedly demanded to meet the individual and find out the person\u2019s identity.\n\n\u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right?\u201d Trump said, according to audio reported by the Los Angeles Times. \u201cWe used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s Republican allies in Congress and conservative media have joined the president in dismissing the whistleblower, accusing the individual of being politically biased.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Washington speak for, \u2018They were out to get the President,\u2019\u201d tweeted Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee.\n\nAs part of their investigation, House Democrats also issued subpoenas on Monday to Defense Secretary Mark Esper and acting White House budget director Russell Vought. The Pentagon and the Office of Management and Budget have until Oct. 15 to comply.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, which is helping to lead the impeachment inquiry, warned last week that any stonewalling by the White House will be considered obstruction of justice.", "description": "Democrats are allegedly considering steps like having the Ukraine whistleblower testify remotely to protect the individual, according to The Washington P...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9bf1c52100002e043342be.jpeg?cache=kwjoejilmt&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
