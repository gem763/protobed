It was too early to determine the timing and exact value of the bonds, the official added.\n\nI\u202en July\u202c \u202e \u202cTunisia has sold a seven-year, euro-denominated bond worth 700 million euros at an interest rate of 6.37%.\n\nIt needs total financing next year worth 11 billion dinars against 10 billion dinars in 2019, the source told Reuters, asking not to be named.\n\nThe external borrowing requirement will rise from 7 billion to about 8.5 billion, he said.\n\nTunisia\u2019s economy has been in trouble since the toppling of autocrat Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011, with unemployment and inflation shooting up.\n\nBut the government official said signs of economic recovery would be clear in 2020, expecting gross domestic product growth to exceed 3%, compared with the 2.5% expected this year. He added that GDP growth could reach 3.4%, driven by higher gas output and growth in agricultural production.\n\nThe Nawara natural gas field, a project jointly owned by Austria\u2019s OMV and the Tunisian National Oil Co., ETAP, started production two months ago. It will almost double national gas output to 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, the government said.\n\nTunisia also expects record production of dates and olive oil, two of its main exports.\n\nThe government aims to reduce its budget deficit from the 3.9% of GDP expected this year to 3% in 2020.\n\n($1 = 0.9151 euros)", "description": "Tunisia needs around 8.5 billion Tunisian dinars ($2.96 billion) in external financing in 2020 and plans to issue bonds up to 800 million euros ($874.24 million) of debt, a senior official told Reuters on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Tarek Amara", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
