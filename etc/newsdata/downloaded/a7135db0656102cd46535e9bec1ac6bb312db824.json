All farms in the program are audited and certified every 15 months to ensure standards are being met.\u201d\n\n\u201cShopping at Thrive Market means supporting a select group of brands that make the world a better place,\u201d said Green. \u201cPartnering with GAP shows our commitment to animal welfare and bringing meaningful claims to our customers.\u201d\n\nGlobal Animal Partnership is one of the largest animal welfare standards and labeling organizations in North America. Established in 2008, GAP impacts the welfare of over 416 million animals each year through third-party certification of more than 3,800 farms, supplying products to over 5,000 outlets. GAP believes that meaningful label claims, validated by third-party audits on every farm, are key to influencing the industry, raising consumer expectations, and creating long-lasting change for farm animals.
