It is believed to be capable of releasing a \"hypersonic glider\" from the edge of space, with a tough-to-predict trajectory.\n\nFor the first time, Beijing showed off its WZ-8 drone, a supersonic reconnaissance unmanned aerial vehicle that could potentially be deployed by aircraft.\n\nAnti-terrorist assault vehicles and armoured anti-riot vehicles from the Falcon Commando Unit also rolled through the square, which Xinhua said was \"mainly used to crack down on terrorism and violence\" and used for \"dealing with emergencies and fighting riots\".\n\nThe parade also featured new-generation main battlefield 99A tanks.\n\nXinhua said 40% of the weaponry displayed at the parade was new and all the armaments were made domestically.\n\n'Closing the gap'\n\nAdam Ni, an expert on China's military modernisation at Macquarie University in Sydney, told AFP the parade showed a \"substantial progress of China's nuclear forces\".\n\n\"Its nuclear arms are increasingly more mobile, resilient, reliable, precise, and technologically advanced,\" he said.\n\n\"They are also more diversified: China is transitioning its nuclear force from a reliance on land-based to one that is also sea-based and air-based, using submarines and stealth bombers.\"\n\nXi said in a speech to kick off the parade that China only seeks \"peaceful development\" and that the two-million-strong PLA will \"firmly uphold world peace\".\n\n\"This display of nuclear weapons doesn't signal a change in China's nuclear strategy,\" said Cui Yiliang, editor-in-chief of industry magazine \"Modern warships\".\n\n\"It will continue to have a small but effective nuclear arsenal. The goal is to have a nuclear deterrent and be able to conduct a second strike in retaliation in case of an attack by a third country,\" Cui said.\n\nIn July Beijing outlined a national defence plan to build a modern, high-tech army.\n\nChina's defence spending is second only to the US - though it still lags far behind - and it said earlier this year it planned to raise it by 7.5% in 2019, though the increase in expenditure has slowed as the economy has cooled in recent years.\n\nIn March Beijing said it would spend 1.19tn yuan ($177.6bn) on defence in 2019, after it increased its outlay by 8.1% to 1.11tn yuan in 2018, according to a government report presented at the start of the annual meeting of the National People's Congress (NPC).\n\nA report in April by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute found China's military spending has risen 83% since 2009, bringing it up to second place, ahead of Saudi Arabia, India and France.\n\nAccording to the report, the US figure alone of $649bn in 2018 was as much as the next eight highest military budgets.\n\nJames Char, a military expert at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, warned there is still some way before China is as big a military technological power as the US.\n\n\"Actual martial prowess is not as easily showcased as displaying military hardware,\" he said.\n\n\"So showing off these weapons - some of them probably still prototypes - at the parade has to be the easiest method for the Chinese Communist Party regime to showcase the country's military might to the world,\" Char said.", "description": "China put its growing military might on full display with a parade of new ballistic missiles, supersonic drones and next-generation battlefield tanks that highlighted Beijing's accelerating race to match the firepower of its US rival.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9419/a468804d65484b3081104a496383527e.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
