The speaker\u2019s anger with Brexit-facing England in this collection is often palpable, and there are some refreshingly sharp thrusts at mendacious politicians, Museum of Lies and Let Me Be Very Clear being particularly well-aimed.\n\nLincolnshire-born, now living in Gloucester, Clarke measures the ugliness of his native land, physical and moral, and avoids sentimentalising the flaws and tarnish, though he sometimes forgives them. The pervasive impression is that the speaker is charting the last days of a soured love affair \u2013 primarily his own relationship with England, but also that of Britain and the continent of Europe. Many poems seem to sing in an undertone the sad refrains of a home-lover whose home has abandoned him.\n\nStation to Station, (also the title of David Bowie\u2019s 10th album), moving restively between the local and the continental, and, possibly, between the past and the present, tells a version of this story. There\u2019s just the right amount of detail in these quatrains to keep them balanced between solidity and sketchiness: notebook jottings, freely punctuated, they connect without an insistent narrative line, and carry their weight as distinct short poems.\n\nThe identity suggested by the pronouns \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cyou\u201d is similarly fluid. The \u201cyou\u201d addressed could be a person (the speaker talking to himself or a partner), it could be England, personified, and it might include all these possibilities. What matters is that the tight-lipped, sometimes sardonically expressed \u201csmall misery\u201d the speaker experiences is relentless and convincing.\n\nThree continental stations alternate with three English ones: all but two boast the word \u201cCentral\u201d in their now-faded titles. Those exceptions have their own form of centrality. Zoologischer Garten (of U2 fame) may belong to Berlin pre-unification (the station lay between West and East), or perhaps to the period shortly afterwards, around the time when U2 celebrated with Achtung Baby. With the Moog sound effects and the pigeons, pointedly described as \u201canalogue\u201d to make an echo for \u201ctravelogue\u201d, it evokes innocent, footloose tourism. By contrast, the King\u2019s Cross poem feels contemporary: nostalgia is vigorously rejected, but the bad old days of drunks and drugs seem friendlier than the present.\n\nThe latte that the addressee is told to \u201csuck\u201d (and, by association, \u201csuck up\u201d) is mere froth, though it\u2019s Nottingham Central that reduces coffee-drinking to ordeal. Here in the \u201cMidlands murk\u201d there\u2019s no option between the scaldingly hot and the vicious chill of unmelting frost: the separation of speaker and addressee is equally no-deal (\u201cWe\u2019re not making a scene. / You have one case. You\u2019re taking everything\u201d).\n\nMilan and Antwerp stations combine assertive architectural grandeur with non-arriving trains: the speaker tries a little grim humour in both, but angry disenchantment is the stronger flavour. Old regimes may equal stasis: socialist values expressed in \u201cindustrial action\u201d seem no more encouraging, and are subsumed in that damning accusation of \u201cquaintness\u201d.\n\nThe final station of the cross, Leeds Central, has a particularly brilliant opening line, with its hard-punching Anglo-Saxon monosyllables: \u201cSaw that bloke from that band you liked\u201d and that almost physically cruel rhyme, \u201cliked\u201d and \u201cspiked\u201d. The quatrain ends with a gentler cadence, and a repetition of sounds (\u201ceternal return\u201d) that is like a fading spell. The return ticket expires. Places are seen for the last time. Relationships end. As ever, the poet chooses candour over consolation.", "description": "Moving between the continent and a grimy England, the dying days of an ambiguous relationship are recorded", "authors": ["Carol Rumens"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d488660fe3db1f2e965f5dbcefda1f1db9f9e306/0_330_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2a07f848f70a663d7f36564ae13be4fc", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
