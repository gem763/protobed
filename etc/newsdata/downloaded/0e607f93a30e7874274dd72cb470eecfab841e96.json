Energy investors have been increasingly restive with anything short of strict financial discipline.\n\nThe $17-a-share offer represents a 65% premium to SemGroup\u2019s closing price Friday, according to a statement. The value of the $1.35 billion cash-and-stock deal rises to $5 billion with the inclusion of debt. SemGroup soared 61% on Monday while its suitor fell 4.2%.\n\nFor deal-hungry Warren, the transaction is his latest run at a consolidation spree that included last year\u2019s pursuit of NuStar GP Holdings LLC, which fizzled when the target rebuffed the approach.\n\nEnergy Transfer was one of the only pipeline operators to fall on a day when oil prices surged the most in a decade after an attack at a Saudi Arabian crude-processing facility.\n\nThe \u201cacquisition this morning represents a sharp reversal from recent messaging on portfolio management, capital discipline and accelerated deleveraging,\u201d Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. analysts said in a note to clients.\n\nInvestors have been similarly harsh on other notable energy deals this year. Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Callon Petroleum Co. plunged after announcing deals to buy Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc., respectively.\n\nBoth buyers now have disgruntled billionaires knocking at the door: Carl Icahn is pushing Occidental to sell the combined company, while John Paulson is urging Callon to scrap the deal and put itself up for sale.\n\nEnergy Transfer is unlikely to draw an activist investor given its structure as a master limited partnership, a model employed by many pipeline companies that shields investors from certain taxes but also comes with fewer rights for common unitholders.\n\nNot all analysts disliked the SemGroup deal. While Sanford C. Bernstein\u2019s research team said investors will likely be \u201cdisappointed,\u201d analysts led by Jean Ann Salisbury said they \u201cdon\u2019t see this deal as a disaster\u201d because $170 million in cost savings Energy Transfer is eyeing are \u201cdoable.\u201d\n\n\u2018A Lot of Frogs\u2019\n\nWarren -- who built his empire scooping up small pipeline companies as the shale boom exploded -- first signaled he could resume buying in August 2018. That was just eight days after the company announced a streamlining move in part meant to improve stock performance.\n\n\u201cWe kiss a lot of frogs looking for a prince,\u201d Warren said on a conference call in November. \u201cWe are working it hard. I will tell you, though, we are not finding any deals.\u201d\n\nDealmaking has been a touchy subject for Warren ever since Energy Transfer walked away from a $33 billion agreement to buy Williams Cos., which would have been its biggest acquisition yet.\n\nSemGroup\u2019s crude and products terminal on the Houston Ship Channel is likely the driver behind Energy Transfer\u2019s decision to buy the company, Wells Fargo Securities\u2019 Michael Blum said in a note Monday. Still, \u201cmany of the other assets don\u2019t seem to fit ET\u2019s footprint and are of lower quality and we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see ET divest some of the assets,\u201d he said.\n\nEnergy Transfer is already looking to sell a 33% stake in its Rover pipeline that carries Appalachian natural gas to customers across the Midwest, people familiar with the matter said in July.\n\n\u201cFrom \u201830,000 feet,\u2019 in a market where investors are pushing companies to reduce spending and leverage and increase free cash flow, we\u2019re not sure the optics of this deal will be met with enthusiasm,\u201d Blum wrote of the SemGroup acquisition.\n\nNo Call\n\nEnergy Transfer is likely to \u201cface investor scrutiny around the asset mix and the merits of the transaction, though at first glance, it passes our litmus test on accretion,\u201d Citigroup Inc. analyst Timm Schneider wrote in a note to clients.\n\n\u201cWe wish we could ask some questions, but there is no conference call,\u201d Schneider said.\n\nWhile Energy Transfer is offering a big takeover premium, Tulsa-based SemGroup has seen its stock fall by more than half in the last year. The company had previously worked with an adviser on alternative options to raise capital, people familiar with the matter said earlier this year.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- On a day when the biggest oil rally in more than a decade boosted most U.S. energy stocks, billionaire Kelcy Warren\u2019s plan to acquire a rival wiped out $1.5 billion of his pipeline giant\u2019s market value.Energy Transfer LP\u2019s announcement Monday that it agreed to purchase SemGroup Corp. sent", "authors": ["Rachel Adams-Heard"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o260AECc1r6JYHjkdjnYzw--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/643389715e6b08a64afb075d93ba4902", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
