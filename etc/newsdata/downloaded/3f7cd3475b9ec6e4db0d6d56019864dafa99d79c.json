He said that offshore wind had the potential to deliver similar steep cost reductions.\n\nBirol said he expected the average generation cost for global offshore wind to halve to $60 per megawatt hour within five years - a reduction driven by lower financing costs and bigger turbines, some measuring almost as high as the Eiffel Tower.\n\nIn Europe, offshore wind will soon beat new natural gas-fired capacity on cost and be on a par with solar PV and onshore wind. In China, it is set to become competitive with new coal-fired capacity around 2030, according to the IEA.\n\nBut Birol cautioned that real political action - and large investments in onshore grid infrastructure - were needed to unlock offshore wind's full potential.\n\n\"If the governments are serious about their climate policies and climate neutrality, they have to have dedicated policies in order to foster green technologies like offshore wind,\" he said.\n\nWhile the green transition is increasingly taking over the global political agenda, there is a growing disconnect between climate ambitions and real-life emissions trends. Energy-related greenhouse gas emissions reached a historic high last year.\n\nThe United Kingdom today has the biggest capacity for wind power, but China is likely to have the largest offshore wind fleet by 2025. The industry is also growing in markets such as the United States, Taiwan and Japan.\n\nDenmark's Orsted is the world's biggest developer of offshore wind, while Siemens Gamesa and MHI Vestas Offshore Wind, a joint venture between Vestas and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, are the largest makers of wind turbines employed at sea.", "description": "IEA official likens the game-changing potential of offshore wind to the shale revolution and the rise of solar PV.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/25/f4e924db78494c8388bc76bee5fff416_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
