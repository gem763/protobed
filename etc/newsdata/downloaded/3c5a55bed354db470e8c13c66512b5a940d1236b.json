More importantly, given the urgency of the climate crisis, it was made from previous seasons\u2019 off-cuts and recycled and sustainably sourced fabrics \u2013 the georgette, for example, was produced using old plastic bottles. That the ruffled frocks tended towards black, a gothic \u2013 and timeless \u2013 spring trend, also felt right. Props to Preen for having recently donated the rest of their waste textiles to initiatives seeking to encourage sewing skills.\n\nPhotograph: REX/Shutterstock", "description": "This season saw a heady mix of schedule regulars as well as up-and-coming stars, with a focus on sustainability", "authors": ["Jo Jones", "Scarlett Conlon", "Hannah Marriott", "Lauren Cochrane", "Leah Harper", "Photograph", "Shaun James Cox Pr", "Adp Pr", "Wwd Rex Shutterstock", "Antonio_Salgado Pr"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/475632d16661eb15040149dbe270a9cd6b9e9948/0_342_5242_3146/master/5242.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8bc445bf0861b68e7996b8e93942731c", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
