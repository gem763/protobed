Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 25, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s the story. It reveals that the whistleblower has a legal team including one member who once worked as an intern for Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton. In 2001. That is literally the entirety of the finding.\n\nThey don\u2019t seem to have a revelation about the whistleblower\u2019s political views \u2014 not that it would even matter, given that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was deemed credible and urgent by the inspector general whom Trump himself appointed. They have something about his lawyer. One of his lawyers. From 18 years ago. If you supposedly love America, Secret Intelligence Community Person, how come you hired a lawyer who once fetched coffee for Democrats 18 years ago?\n\nGuess it\u2019s pretty serious.", "description": "Yesterday evening, Fox News breathlessly broke an \u201cEXCLUSIVE\u201d report, that the Trump administration had revelations about the whistleblower\u2019s political bias.
