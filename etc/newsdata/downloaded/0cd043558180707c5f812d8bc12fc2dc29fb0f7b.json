Waiters averaged 14.3 minutes per game in four preseason appearances.\n\nWaiters is the second player to face publicly announced punishment from the Heat already this season. James Johnson was not permitted to attend training camp because his level of conditioning was not at the team\u2019s standards, and returned to practice late in the preseason.\n\nWaiters is entering his fourth season with the Heat. He\u2019s missed 126 of a possible 246 games over the last three years, largely because of ankle injuries and a subsequent surgery on his foot and ankle.\n\nWaiters averaged 12.0 points last season in 44 games. The Heat said he will be permitted to return to the team on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Shooting guard Dion Waiters has been suspended by the Miami Heat for their season opener against Memphis on Wednesday night for what was described as \"conduct detrimental to the team.\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Reynolds"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
