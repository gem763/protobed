Insider has not independently verified the claims in Lauer's letter.\n\nVisit Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe sexual-misconduct allegations that got Matt Lauer fired from the \"Today\" show in 2017 are being revealed for the first time in Ronan Farrow's coming book, \"Catch and Kill.\"\n\nVariety, which obtained a preview copy, reports that Farrow interviewed Lauer's accuser, whose identity is revealed for the first time.\n\nBrooke Nevils was an NBC News staffer, who flew to the 2014 Sochi Olympics to work with Meredith Vieira, who was brought back from retirement to coanchor the \"Today\" show from the Russia games.\n\nShe alleges that Lauer raped her one night after drinking with him at the hotel bar.\n\nNevils told Farrow she and Vieira went to the hotel bar after work one night and ran into Lauer, who joined them. She said she proceeded to drink six shots of vodka and ended up going back to Lauer's room twice that night. The first time, she said, was to get her press credentials, which Lauer had playfully stolen from her. The second time was after Lauer invited her back.\n\nAccording to the book, she \"had no reason to suspect Lauer would be anything but friendly based on prior experience.\"\n\nOn the second trip back to the room, Nevils said Lauer kissed her, pushed her on the bed, and kept asking if she liked anal sex. She said she declined several times.\n\nFarrow writes that Nevils \"was in the midst of telling him she wasn't interested again when he 'just did it.'\" She said that the encounter was painful and that she \"bled for days.\"\n\nRead more: Lauer's former 'Today' show colleagues say they are 'disturbed' by the 'shocking and appalling' rape allegations\n\nLauer was fired from NBC after Nevils filed a complaint\n\nLauer on September 7, 2016, in New York. Getty Images/Justin Sullivan\n\nWhile Nevils said she told several people about what happened to her, she didn't report him until seeing the response to the Harvey Weinstein scandal in 2017. It was then that she decided to tell Vieira what happened, who told her she should go to human resources. Lauer was swiftly fired, though NBC News did not release many details about what the accusation was at the time.\n\nNevils also says in the book that she had sex with Lauer multiple times after returning to New York, and sources close to Lauer emphasized to Farrow that Nevils was sometimes the person who initiated sex.\n\nNevils said she blamed herself for this, but stresses \"it was completely transactional. It was not a relationship.\" And regarding what happened in Sochi, there is no doubt in her mind that it was rape because she was \"too drunk to consent\" and she said \"multiple times\" that she didn't want to have sex.\n\nFarrow also adds that many of the sexual-assault victims he has interviewed said they had sex again with the men who assaulted them.\n\nThe book was reportedly vigorously fact-checked. One phone call between fact-checker Sean Lavery and NBC lasted 10 hours, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nWhen contacted by Variety about the allegations detailed in Farrow's book, NBC News released the following statement: \"Matt Lauer's conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time. That's why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague.\"\n\nNevils isn't the only person to accuse Lauer of inappropriate behavior. A few weeks after he was fired, former \"Today\" production assistant Addie Zinone told Variety said she had a consensual relationship, but that looking back she believes Lauer \"took advantage\" of her.\n\nOutlets reported other allegations of sexual misconduct including Lauer making lewd comments to female colleagues, exposing himself, and using a mechanism to close his door while women were alone in his office with him.\n\nInsider reached out to representatives of Lauer for comment Wednesday morning, and they responded with this statement:\n\nInsider has not independently verified the claims in Lauer's letter.\n\nFarrow's book, \"Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators,\" is due out on October 15.\n\nIf you are a survivor of sexual assault, you can call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800.656.HOPE (4673) or visit hotline.rainn.org/online and receive confidential support.", "description": "Brooke Nevils told Ronan Farrow that she told Matt Lauer she didn't want to have sex multiple times before he raped her after drinking at a hotel bar.", "authors": ["Ashley Collman"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9de5b9695b5829853c6025?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
