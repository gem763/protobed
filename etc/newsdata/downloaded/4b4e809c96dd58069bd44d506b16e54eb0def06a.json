Instead, the boat was forced to wait for six days in the Mediterranean, as several European countries drew up an ad hoc plan to redistribute the migrants, with a small portion remaining in Italy.\n\nSome Italian lawmakers described the outcome as the start of a less hostile era toward people fleeing Africa and the Middle East.\n\nBut experts and some involved in rescuing migrants said it remained unclear whether Italy\u2019s government, which formally took office Tuesday, would bring about wholesale changes.\n\n\n\nRescued migrants look at the horizon aboard the Ocean Viking, a rescue vessel that Italy allowed to come ashore.

They also note that Italy\u2019s new government, which came to power after weeks of backroom negotiations, would face public backlash with any surge in migration.\n\nThe far-right League, which lost its place in the government coalition in a power-play-gone-wrong, remains the country\u2019s most popular party. That party\u2019s leader, Matteo Salvini, said Italy was reopening its ports and would become the \u201crefugee field of Europe.\u201d\n\n[Italy disrupts Steve Bannon\u2019s plans for right-wing academy]\n\nLuigi Di Maio, the head of the Five Star Movement, one of the two parties in the governing coalition, said it was a \u201cgreat misunderstanding\u201d to think Italy had changed course, noting that the boat was allowed to come toward port because of the arrangement reached with other European countries.\n\nOver the previous 14 months, Italy \u2014 which had been the de facto landing spot \u2014 had forcefully slammed the door to humanitarian rescue vessels, upending how the continent handles migration. Europe has since struggled to draw up a system for how to handle migrants rescued at sea. In more than two dozen cases, boats have been stalled in the Mediterranean \u2014 sometimes for several weeks.\n\nDuring previous standoffs, Salvini, a prolific social media user, would make repeated announcements that Italian ports were irrevocably closed to the nongovernmental groups he equated with smugglers. Salvini has been replaced as interior minister with a bureaucrat, Luciana Lamorgese. Italian media have noted that she does not have a Twitter account.\n\n\u201cIs the tide turning for [search-and-rescue] under Italy\u2019s new government?\u201d a German rescue group, Sea-Watch, said in a statement on Twitter. \u201cOr is this minimal respect for the rule of international law a short-lived promise of change? Time will tell, but for now, we are relieved at the prospect of arrival for those awaiting safe harbor.\u201d\n\nThe Ocean Viking, jointly run by French organizations Doctors Without Borders and SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, had picked up its migrants in two separate rescues.\n\nThe boat had originally rescued 84 people, but two \u2014 a woman about to give birth and her husband \u2014 were airlifted Wednesday to Malta. An SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e spokeswoman, Sophie Rahal, said she did not want to discuss politics, but she noted that when the Ocean Viking was operating in August, it was not given access to Italian ports.\n\n\u201cYes, for us it is a change, as we are now officially allowed to enter the Italian waters,\u201d she said.\n\nEurope is dealing with political challenges of migration even as the number of new arrivals has plummeted from the crisis levels of 2015 and 2016.\n\nSeveral Italian governments, including a left-center administration that preceded Salvini, have adopted measures to cut off flows across the Mediterranean, helping to rebuild the Libyan Coast Guard, which often intercepts dinghies and returns migrants to Libya. This year, some 5,800 people have arrived by sea in Italy, compared with more than 180,000 in 2016.\n\n[How a law professor managed to become Italy\u2019s prime minister \u2014 twice]\n\nThe new Italian government is headed by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who served in the same position in the coalition between the League and the Five Star Movement. But Conte has built more power for himself in the new administration and has signaled a willingness to deal with Europe on migration problems.\n\nSeveral days ago, he suggested that the European Union set up a distribution plan in which countries that want to keep their doors closed face financial penalties. In an interview published Friday by the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, Germany\u2019s interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said Germany was willing to take 25 percent of migrants that land in Italy.\n\nEuropean Union countries are meeting later this month in Malta to discuss the migration proposals.\n\nJudith Sunderland, the associate director for the Europe and Central Asia division at Human Rights Watch, said Salvini had been less interested in negotiating with Europe over how to handle migration because \u201che benefited politically from every single standoff.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is another reason why it is so important for there to be some kind of long-term predictable arrangement in place,\u201d Sunderland said. \u201cIt\u2019s also, in the long term, about demonstrating that Europe can have humane, rights-respecting policies around migration.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nAnalysis: Italy\u2019s political crisis marks a populist failure\n\nThe captain who defied Italy and brought rescued migrants to port\n\nNi\u00adger\u00adian mafia in Italy further polarized migration debate\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Italy\u2019s new government faced its first test on how to respond to migrant vessels in the Mediterranean.", "authors": ["Chico Harlan", "Rome Bureau Chief Covering Southern Europe", "Sometimes Parts Beyond", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XZ4J5SM_1wvAdJkTYn2aDyZs19w=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G7LOLFWW7EI6TE2DIDNVPT3KXU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
