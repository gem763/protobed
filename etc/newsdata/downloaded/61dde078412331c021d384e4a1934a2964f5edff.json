The study included interviews with parents and teachers as well as the children at key stages.\n\nThe study provides a cautionary tale: it was conducted before the debut of Apple\u2019s iPhone AAPL, +1.00% in 2007 and the advent of tablets and smartphones made screens so ubiquitous. Instead, researchers looked at those who had televisions in their bedrooms from an early age, and who watched a lot of TV. Today, most kids have a screen in their bedroom, whether it\u2019s a television, smartphone or tablet.\n\nThe new findings from Common Sense Media say many tweens and teens are flocking to YouTube GOOG, +1.97%. For example, 76% of 8- to 12-year-olds said they frequented the online video platform. Last month, federal regulators fined YouTube $170 million for collecting the personal data of viewers under age 13. The company didn\u2019t admit liability, but said it was making changes.\n\nChildren with a television in their bedroom tended to watch about half an hour more TV per day even at preschool age, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al researchers found. They were more likely to become overweight by the time they became teenagers and more likely to report unhealthy eating habits, data showed.\n\nThroughout the population studied, having your own TV set when very young also predicted higher levels of self-reported depressive symptoms, teacher-reported emotional distress, victimization, physical aggression and poorer social skills.\n\nAlso see: Limiting screen time for your kid is harder than it sounds\n\nThe Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al study was co-authored by professor Linda Pagani, a psychology professor at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al\u2019s School of Psycho-Education, professor Marie Josee Herbec of the university\u2019s School Environment Research Group, and Tracie Barnett, an associate professor at the Sainte-Justine Hospital Research Center.\n\nAt first, the researchers thought there could be other factors at work. Children who spend hours in their rooms watching TV could be in troubled homes. They could have psychological problems from a very early age. They may be living in families with less parental \u201csocial capital,\u201d including formal education.\n\nThe findings suggest that very young children are missing out on key aspects of their brain development when they spend so much time staring at a screen instead of interacting with the world.\n\nBut the \u201cscreen time\u201d effect held true even after they controlled for these factors. Researchers say there is further work to be done to examine relationship between too much screen time and negative outcomes. The study, as always, can only point to a correlation rather than a cause and an effect.\n\nBut scientists have long understood the importance for future brain development of a child\u2019s early years, when neural pathways expand most quickly. Too much screen time may deprive children of other, richer activities that help to hone cognitive, social, emotional and physical skills, Pagani and her co-authors wrote.\n\nWatching a screen \u2014 whether it\u2019s a TV, smartphone or tablet \u2014 encourages children to be more sedentary, and makes them less mindful about food if they eat while they watch, they added.\n\nThere are some important differences between TVs and tablets. Tablets are portable while big TVs are not, so if you\u2019re watching \u201cFrozen\u201d over and over on your iPad, you don\u2019t have to stay in your room or near the TV. In other words, children are more likely to spend more time gazing at a screen.\n\nSee also: Maybe your teen\u2019s Snapchat obsession isn\u2019t so harmful after all\n\nOn the plus side, computer games are more interactive than TV shows so they may engage more of the brain. Computer games are even more immersive and compelling than movies or TV. It\u2019s eight years since author Nicholas Carr exposed in \u201cThe Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains how too much screen time is rewiring even adult brains, and not in a good way.\n\nAs concerns around children\u2019s apparent addiction to screens have grown, Apple has introduced controls to help parents limit the amount of time kids are on devices. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in 2018 that the company never intended for anyone to spend too much time on their phones, but that some people do. \u201cHonestly, we\u2019ve never wanted people to overuse our products,\u201d Cook said.\n\nShares of Apple are up over 57% year-to-date and shares of Google are up 22%, compared to a 16% increase for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.49% and a 21% increase for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.56%\n\nThis story was published on April 10, 2019 and updated on October 28, 2019.", "description": "A new says teens spend nearly 7.5 hours a day in front of a screen, and not for school work.", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-04-10"}
