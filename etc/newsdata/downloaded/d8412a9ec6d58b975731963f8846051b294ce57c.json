But these drugs have lost their protective effects against some types of bacteria in recent decades. Certain bacteria are immune to today\u2019s medicines.\n\nDrug-resistant forms of tuberculosis, staph infections and gonorrhea are just some of the current health threats, the National Institute of Health says.\n\nWhile some of the most dangerous superbugs had been confined to hospitals and other health care settings, some strains are out in the community, making anyone vulnerable to infection.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a problem that\u2019s not going away,\u201d Michael Craig, senior adviser for the CDC\u2019s Antibiotic Resistance Coordination and Strategy Unit, said at the panel discussion. \u201cWe just want to underline the fact that this is a problem that does have the potential to impact every person on the planet.\u201d\n\nBecause of modern travel of people, animals and goods, antimicrobial resistance can spread across borders and continents.\n\n\u201cWe need to really recognize this is a growing threat, not just in our country, but really globally that we ultimately have to address,\u201d Mr. Craig said.\n\nA strategy to combat antimicrobial resistance is stewardship, an approach of using antibiotics only when needed, Dr. Patel said.\n\nAnd a crucial tool for stewardship programs is diagnostic testing, said Susan Van Meter, executive director for AdvaMedDx, a medical device company. She said diagnostic tools can help identify pathogens, provide assurance to clinicians that antibiotics are needed and determine which antibiotics to use.\n\nMs. Van Meter said patient education on when to use antibiotics is also important, pointing to a study that showed that one-third of patients with the flu received a prescription for antibiotics.\n\nAntibiotics can help fight against bacterial infections like ear infections and strep throat but don\u2019t work against viruses such as those that cause colds or the flu.\n\nKalvin Yu, medical director of Medical Informatics, noted that antibiotic resistance is not the same across states and said providing heat maps for drug-resistant pathogens to hospitals could give staff a better idea about geographic resistance.\n\nAside from trying to prevent infections in the first place, Dr. Patel also noted the importance of developing non-antibiotic treatments. She pointed to fecal microbiota transplants, which fight infection by adding good bacteria to the gut, to treat a diarrheal illness called Clostridium difficile, a leading antibiotic resistance threat, as an example.\n\nIndividuals can help prevent drug-resistant infections by taking antibiotics as prescribed, using good hygiene practices and safe sex practices, getting vaccinated and preparing food safely.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
