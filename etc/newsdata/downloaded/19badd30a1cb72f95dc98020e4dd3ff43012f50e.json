Meanwhile, he can get things back on track without the intense scrutiny and awkward roster construction that has plagued the Lakers during his time there.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nOf course, that\u2019s not to say that Ball didn\u2019t come away with anything useful during his time in Los Angeles. Speaking on a podcast this week, Ball said that the person who actually mentored him most last season was\u2026 LeBron James.\n\nVia Rick Croy\u2019s podcast:\n\n\u201cThe person who\u2019s mentored me the most in the last year is probably LeBron. Just being with him pretty much the whole year: same team, same bus, same hotel. I was just always with him and just picking up what I can from the greatest to ever play.\u201d\n\nHopefully Ball looks back and sees his time with the Lakers as useful. Any reservations about his father aside, Ball has excellent potential for a future in the NBA.
