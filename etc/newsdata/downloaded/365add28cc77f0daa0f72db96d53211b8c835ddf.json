With social and family groups spread increasingly far and wide, we think nothing of moving from the place we grew up in to go after a decent job, a promising career and, hopefully, a salary to match.\n\nGone are the days of staying put, of getting a job in a nearby town and being restricted to the jobs on offer there. The whole world is our oyster, the endless possibilities are out there for the taking. As long as you can afford somewhere to live.\n\nShocking new figures from socioeconomic think tank, the Resolution Foundation has revealed this week that rising rents mean young adults are unable to move to UK cities where average salaries are higher because they can\u2019t afford the cost of living.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn fact, the number of young people in private rented accommodation who moved for a new job has almost halved in the last 20 years.\n\nBroadly dismissing any effects of falling unemployment failing to have the same \u201cpush\u201d effects on those looking for work or the \u201cpull\u201d of buoyant areas, the foundation warned that rents have risen by almost 90 per cent in the highest-paying 30 per cent of local authorities over the past 20 years, compared with just over 70 per cent among the 30 per cent lowest paying places.\n\nAnd that means the wage rise you might expect from a move is smaller than it used to be, and that the boost to your standard of living by moving has also shrunk.\n\nOnce housing costs are deducted, the average private renter moving from a low-paying area (such as East Devon) to a mid-paying area (such as Bristol) would have seen a financial gain of 16 per cent in 1997, compared with just 1 per cent last year.\n\nSimilarly, moving from a low-paying area straight to a high-paying area (such as Croydon) would have seen a financial gain of 26 per cent in 1997, compared with 3 per cent loss last year.\n\nIt\u2019s the same story with ownership. House prices grew four times as fast as wages in the 10 per cent of local authorities with the highest earnings over the past 20 years. In the 10 per cent of local authorities with the lowest earnings, house prices grew by less than three times the rate of wage increases.\n\n\u201cNot only does this increase in price relative to other areas reduce the incentives to move in terms of the impact on ongoing housing costs; the widening absolute gap between earnings and house prices will effectively lock out those without substantial amounts of equity or savings from moving to a more productive area,\u201d the report added.\n\nA degree doesn\u2019t change much either, according to separate data from the Landbay Rental Index. Graduates moving to London for their first job after university, for example, will probably have to spend 40 per cent of their take-home pay on rent.\n\n\u201cYoung professionals now need to weigh up a variety of factors, including commuting length, travel costs and, above all, rent,\u201d says John Goodall, CEO and founder of Landbay.\n\n\u201cThis is especially true if they hope to save and invest, with the goal of achieving that first step onto the property ladder in the future.\u201d\n\nBut even that long-held assumption is increasingly up for debate.\n\nAccording to a recent survey by Close Brothers, half of non-homeowners don\u2019t think that they\u2019ll ever be able to afford to get on the property ladder, despite home ownership remaining an aspiration for 65 per cent of those who don\u2019t own property.\n\nAcross the generations, a quarter of UK employees are spending more than 50 per cent of their monthly income on housing costs. One in 10 is spending more than 70 per cent of their income on a home.\n\nWith one in five millennials saying their housing costs are painfully high, it\u2019s little wonder that a similar proportion have been burnt by their bills and now have no desire to get on the property ladder in the future.\n\n\u201cHousing is a key area of financial wellbeing,\u201d says Jeanette Makings, head of financial education at Close Brothers.\n\n\u201cHowever, there seems to be a gap between perception and reality. While there\u2019s confidence around affordability, a huge proportion of people\u2019s salaries are going on housing costs. This makes saving for the future more difficult and contributes to the scale of uncertainty when it comes to taking the first step onto the property ladder.\u201d\n\nAnd alleviating that uncertainty is a job for our bosses, Makings argues.\n\n\u201cAll of these issues can be improved by a solid financial education programme, supporting employees in their ambitions be they short or long term,\u201d she adds. \u201cEmployers can help employees in this respect, improving their financial health and creating a happier and more productive workforce.\u201d", "description": "Ours is a dynamic workforce.
