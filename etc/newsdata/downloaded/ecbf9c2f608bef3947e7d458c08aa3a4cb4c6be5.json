Hackers breached Zappos servers and stole the personal data, excluding payment card details, for more than 24 million customers [1, 2, 3].\n\nImpacted users filed a class-action lawsuit following the hack, claiming that Zappos did not adequately protect their data, and demanding reparations.\n\nZappos initially managed to have the class-action dismissed, but plaintiffs won on the appeal. Zappos' attempt to have the case heard at the US Supreme Court failed earlier this year, forcing the company to enter a settlement with the victims.\n\nPreliminary settlement\n\nFollowing months of negotiations and back and forward, the two parties finally reached a preliminary settlement on September 19. As part of the proposed settlement, Zappos will not be admitting to any fault in the security breach.\n\nThe preliminary settlement's terms have been published on the class-action lawsuit's website.\n\nAccording to court documents, class lawyers will be emailing impacted Zappos users this month to inform them of the settlement's terms, ways they can opt-out and file a new lawsuit, or ways in which they can file objections to deny the settlement's approval.\n\nBarring any major development on December 20, which usually doesn't happen, the settlement is as good as final.\n\nFollowing its formal approval by the class-action judge, users will have 60 days to request and use their 10% discount. Probably not the outcome many Zappos users were expecting.\n\nZappos could not be immediately reached for comment.", "description": "Seven-years-old class-action lawsuit nears its end, but data breach victims won't be happy.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/17/0d298a53-cdd2-4321-84c2-a274cf1d8dfb/thumbnail/770x578/23231e216c935b85ba52814920033c01/zappos-vector.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
