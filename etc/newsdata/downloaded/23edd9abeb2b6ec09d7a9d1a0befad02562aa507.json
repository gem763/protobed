The first time it is used to describe the skin colour of a gun-toting meth addict he encounters during a stint as a sex worker in Tucson. The second to describe the colour of the thigh-high boots worn by the hair stylist at a salon he lands at in Los Angeles in 2008. He is 19. Later, Jane Fonda, a customer, tells Van Ness his hair makes him look like Jesus.\n\nBetween these two smoky lavenders is a gulf that separates two versions of Van Ness: the garrulous, sassy, resident groomer of Queer Eye \u2013 and the emotionally bruised, risk-taking addict. As he warns readers midway through the book, \u201cBuckle up, buttercup, because I can go from comedy to tragedy in three seconds flat.\u201d\n\nVan Ness and I are in a Cadillac sedan, driving past the tangled, rusting architecture of Philadelphia\u2019s suburbs. Travelling like this is normal for him \u2013 on Queer Eye, he gets to roam the country waving his wand and transforming lives. The show, which was brought out of cold storage last year after an 11-year hiatus, has been a surprising success. America, it seems, is hungry for its uplifting brand of magic. A lot of that comes down to Van Ness, the show\u2019s foremost cheerleader for Queer Eye\u2019s stated mission of turning red (Republican) states pink, \u201cone makeover at a time\u201d. It\u2019s Van Ness who brings the energy to the party, Yass queening his way through each episode, scattering memes and neologisms wherever he goes, and generally helping people connect to their feelings, often by tapping into his own. Tears are never far below the surface. Resistance is futile. Everyone loves him.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Looking sharp: the Fab Five from the first series of Queer Eye. Photograph: Gavin Bond/Netflix\n\nVan Ness has a hectic, energetic style and a voice that soars high and then higher. In the car he talks quickly, words tumbling out of his mouth in a way that can leave you trailing far behind. When I ask if any of his encounters on Queer Eye have changed him, he answers: \u201cThe act of showing up for your family and being able to live in the world I think is heroic. There\u2019s like 15 bajillion eggs in the ovaries and who even knows how many, like, little spermies are in there, so the fact we got to be born and be living this long is kind of like a mathematical who-knew.\u201d This is, I think, a roundabout way of saying we all deserve to be acknowledged. But things are way more fun when Van Ness says them.\n\nFor our meeting, I\u2019d taken the train from New York to Philadelphia, where Van Ness was filming an episode of the show, with vague plans to walk to the Liberty Bell. But he\u2019d just received a 24-hour reprieve from work and, shortly before arriving, his publicist suggested I drive back to New York with him. Sitting in the back of a car with someone you\u2019ve never met can be awkward, and I was conflicted. But Van Ness disarms with charm. A pop culture magpie, he slides from subject to subject and dares you to keep up. How he finds time to watch so much, know so much, work so much, is a conundrum. Lately, he has learned to meditate as a way to manage his stress. \u201cOn Sundays I sometimes don\u2019t work,\u201d he says.\n\nWe are on Route 95 somewhere outside of Philadelphia and, as we navigate the traffic, we admire his latest manicure, each nail painted to represent a different cast member of the 1996 comedy the First Wives Club, a touchstone for Van Ness.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018On Sundays I sometimes don\u2019t work\u2019: Jonathan Van Ness. Photograph: Danielle Levitt/The Observer\n\n\u201cThis is Goldie Hawn getting her lips done,\u201d he says, lifting a finger for inspection. We talk about cats \u2013 he has four, including Liza Meownelli \u2013 and we watch an old video that surfaced late last year on the Jimmy Kimmel Show. In it the 11-year old Van Ness performs an interpretative dance to Jewel\u2019s Pieces of You \u2013 his entry in the school talent show. For the number, he wore a kabuki mask positioned on the back of his head and a baggy black T-shirt emblazoned with a question mark. The piece, inspired by an ice-skating routine, culminates in a triple-axel-style pirouette that is so wholehearted, so gutsy and so precious that it\u2019s heartbreaking. At the time, his mother gently suggested he might want to reconsider. The other kids, she said, might not let him live it down. But when had they ever?\n\nWhat Van Ness knew early on was that the world of women was more interesting to him than the world of men. He recalls at the age of four telling his father\u2019s friend that he wanted to be a cabana girl or a cosmetologist when he grew up. As an adult, he would gravitate to the term \u201cgender queer\u201d to express his place in the world, but that wasn\u2019t an option in childhood. A particularly painful story conjures his father\u2019s war on his gender exploration. \u201cI remember very clearly my dad finding me in an evening gown with my two cousins,\u201d he says. \u201cHe tore me out of the dress, holding me in the air so that I was perpendicular to the ground. I was terrified.\u201d\n\nBut there were pockets of joy, too. Joining the junior varsity cheerleading squad at high school at 14 was an epiphany \u2013 he felt at home immediately. When I make the faux pas of forgetting who starred in Bring It On, the cult 1999 cheerleading movie, Van Ness gasps. \u201cI could almost throw you out of the back of this car for asking such a preposterous question,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, you\u2019re telling me you came to this interview not having seen Bring It On? What were you doing?\u201d\n\nIn season four of Queer Eye, viewers saw Van Ness return to his high school in Quincy to makeover his arts teacher, Cathy Dooley, a beloved figure who stood out for not making him feel different or unusual. The cameras show Van Ness performing with the cheerleading squad as students clap and whoop. It\u2019s a moving spectacle that implies a circle has been closed. Everyone loves queer people now, even in Quincy.\n\nBut what we see on screen is not the whole truth. A few weeks before the Fab Five arrived, the school had asked parents to sign permission slips for their children to be on camera, prompting protests from a local pastor. \u201cHe sent a letter to the newspaper that blasted the normalisation of LGBTQ culture, and said we should not be rolling out the welcome mats at a public school,\u201d Van Ness says. \u201cIt was just a really nasty letter.\u201d Nor was it just any old pastor. \u201cThis was someone who was like a family friend, someone I\u2019d known for a very long time.\u201d He looks glum. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve come as far as I wished and hoped that we had.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Smile please: posing for a selfie with a fan at 2019 MTV Video Music Awards in New Jersey. Photograph: Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images\n\nLeaving small town America in order to be fully himself, only to find being fully himself is what brings him back to small town America, is an irony not lost on Van Ness. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit Gift of the Magi,\u201d he says. But he also knows Quincy is his secret weapon because \u201ceven the most Republican-ass Trump supporter is someone I have grown up next door to\u201d. Or even grown up with. Three years ago, he had to work hard to convince his father not to vote for Trump. \u201cI cussed my dad out 300 of the days of 2016,\u201d he says. \u201cOur relationship literally was on thin ice over that election.\u201d In the end, Van Ness Senior voted for Gary Johnson, the nominee for the Libertarian party. \u201cI was really proud of him for it,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen the original Queer Eye premiered on the Bravo channel in 2003, it was a more straightforward makeover show inspired by advice columns in Esquire magazine. Where it was radical was in the casting of five confident, unapologetic gay men to dish advice to hapless straight men. But people rarely cried and there was little talk of self-care. \u201cI was just trying to get guys out of pleated khakis and to get them to cut off their mullets,\u201d says Carson Cressley, who starred in the original. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us thought the show had any sort of idea about making a political statement.\u201d The 2018 reboot, on Netflix, repackaged the Fab Five as social missionaries spreading the gospel of love around America. A masterstroke was to take the guys out of New York, where the original show had been located, and into the heartland states that voted for Donald Trump in 2016. In a fractured society, the show would open minds by showing that our similarities were greater than our differences. Or, as another of the Fab Five, Karamo Brown, said in the opening episode of season one: \u201cWe\u2019ve all got to come together in a way we can understand each other.\u201d\n\nThere have been four seasons of Queer Eye since its debut in February 2018 and a new one will drop early next year. The show\u2019s hosts have not wasted time, assiduously attending to their brand while they still enjoy the spotlight. Three have published books this year and this month it\u2019s the turn of Van Ness. His memoir, Over the Top, could have been a ghostwriter\u2019s gift, packed with his witticisms and mantras for self-care. Instead it\u2019s a lightning bolt \u2013 devastating and stirring, powered by years of anguish and humiliation. Does he worry how fans will react to his own revelations? \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut I\u2019m ready to pull the Band Aid off.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve come as far as I wished and hoped that we had\u2019: Jonathan Van Ness. Photograph: Danielle Levitt/The Observer\n\nFor Van Ness, Over the Top is about charting his own path through adolescence towards the triumph that is Queer Eye, but it\u2019s also about owning \u2013 and thereby defusing \u2013 two of the most traumatic chapters in his life. The first occurred when he was four, when an older boy molested him in a closet. Van Ness tells his parents but it\u2019s written off as \u201cexperimentation\u201d and swiftly passed over. That single act of abuse casts a long, pernicious shadow over the book as we witness the ways in which Van Ness acts out his confusion and pain, from taking crystal meth, to sustained binges in sex clubs that satisfy his need to be wanted. He joins a 12-step programme for sex addiction, but relapses.\n\nIn the midst of all that, his stepfather, Steve, is diagnosed with bladder cancer, and told he has 11 months to live. His death, when it comes, knocks Van Ness back into the unhealthy behaviour he\u2019s been working to quit.\n\n\u201cEverything that happened to me that summer will always be painful to think about,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was like saying goodbye to so much of what I wanted.\u201d\n\nShortly after the funeral, his former boyfriend tracked him down at a bathhouse in St Louis and Van Ness\u2019s fall to rock bottom seems complete. Almost. When he gets sick, collapsing at the hair salon he is working at one afternoon, he already knows what a doctor will tell him a day later: he is HIV positive.\n\nVan Ness writes about these bombshells with a quiet tenacity that skirts melodrama. He wonders if his reckless behaviour was a self-fulfilling prophecy, the consequence of all the fear ingrained in him at such a young age. He wants other people not to have to go through the same thing.\n\n\u201cIt occurred to me: what if everything I\u2019ve ever been through was preparing me for this moment \u2013 to be strong enough to share this, and to share it on my own terms,\u201d he says. \u201cPart of that for me is to process what\u2019s happened, but the bigger part is that I wanted to do something to move the conversation forward in a meaningful way around HIV/Aids, and what it is to live with HIV, and to humanise and normalise a lot of the things I talk about.\u201d He blinks, then adds, \u201cI\u2019m talking slow because I\u2019m trying not to cry.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I wanted to do something to move the conversation forward in a meaningful way\u2019: Jonathan Van Ness on his HIV activism. Photograph: Danielle Levitt/The Observer\n\nWe are nearing New York, and the canyons of Manhattan fill the hazy skyline. Growing up, Van Ness used to fantasise he would help other people like himself. \u201cI always felt that was part of my purpose,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I thought it would be a really chic juice studio with great baked goods, maybe a dance and yoga studio.\u201d He didn\u2019t think the way he\u2019d help people was simply by being himself on a global TV show \u2013 or by penning a generous and frank memoir.\n\nAt a certain point, Van Ness picked himself up and decided he didn\u2019t want to throw away his life. \u201cIt really took some time to figure out how to put my life together,\u201d he says. But medical advances mean the virus is now undetectable in his blood. He remembers the day he was given his HIV diagnosis, asking the doctor if he could still live to be 75. \u201cShe was, like, \u2018I will keep you alive long enough to die of a heart attack or cancer like everyone else,\u2019 and then she laughed uncontrollably.\u201d\n\nIs he making time for relationships? Van Ness shakes his head. \u201cIn the past, I\u2019ve had relationships with people who I was almost using to validate myself and my existence, and that\u2019s not been a great plan for me,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, this is a season of me falling in love with myself all the way.\u201d\n\nIn some ways, he thinks that testing positive for HIV has been his liberation. In the past year, he has taken up ice-skating and thrown himself into gymnastics. And, of course, there is an election to fight. \u201cI absolutely do not think I\u2019d have been as socially aware or conscious or want to make as much of a difference,\u201d he says. \u201cIt gave me a reason to really fight.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I want to humanise a lot of the difficult things I talk about\u2019: Jonathan Van Ness. Photograph: Danielle Levitt/The Observer\n\nYou know those plants that are always trying to find the light?\n\nExtract from Over the Top by Jonathan Van Ness\n\nPicture me in the seventh grade: a chubby, slightly snaggletoothed kid with a voluminous mop of frizzy curly hair. I\u2019d be cycling through several of my cutest looks, usually monochromatic jumpers with severe Doc Martens boots, just to go to the mall. It felt entirely possible that a talent scout would be there, in the nation\u2019s smallest capital of Springfield, Illinois I\u2019d practice ice-skating routines in my living room, trying to be like the Olympians I idolised, imagining how triumphant I\u2019d be when I finally seized that gold medal. The years of fantasising about reaching stratospheric fame through a local mall discovery had long since faded by 2017. I\u2019d settled for much more attainable goals. I became a hairdresser, working in both LA and New York. I\u2019d stumbled, very grate- fully, into a side hustle in the form of a web series called Gay of Thrones. That spring I would move to Atlanta to shoot a dream project with four new friends. We had beaten out the collective gay world for these five coveted positions, and we all knew it was a monumental opportunity. Like Maya Angelou taught me, I was hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst, so that nothing could catch me off guard. I was just happy that I had completed my mission of escaping cornfield-small-town-only- gay-person infamy and was now free to live an authentic queer life in a gorgeous big city with a Trader Joe\u2019s and nobody thinking twice about my leggings.\n\nA year later in February, Queer Eye had just come out, and I was on my way to a meeting. To my shock I arrived early, so I went to grab a coffee, and as I was walking in, this lady with the most gorgeous ex- pertly done microbraids and giant glasses stopped me and bellowed, \u201cHoney, this faggotry you are serving is giving me everything!\u201d\n\nAt first, I was confused. Did she just call me a fag? But the smile on her face and her extreme proximity seemed to suggest a loving and enamoured person. I\u2019m now doubly confused, I\u2019m running ahead of schedule, and strangers are stopping me. Mind you, it\u2019s still 8.15am, my eyes still subtly perma-stoned from last night\u2019s edible, and I hadn\u2019t even had my coffee yet! So I said, \u201cThanks, queen,\u201d and continued on my way.\n\nBut then two steps later, two other girls stopped me. They said they were living for the show and asked if they could take selfies. Of course I said, \u201cYes, sweets!\u201d and that caused a few more girls from outside the shop to come in for what was quickly becoming an impromptu meet-and-greet. My original encounter from the store got in line for her pic next, then be- came the photographer for the rest of the meet-and-greet. After thanking all my new friends, I left the coffee shop to head back with no coffee because I forgot. Well, that was fun. How much am I thriving right now? I thought.\n\nCrossing the street to go to my meeting, a very nice man stopped me and began playing twenty questions with me about my life, about the show, about everything. I obliged, because I\u2019m eternally a people pleaser, and I didn\u2019t want him to feel bad, but at that point my early arrival turned into being fully actually late to the meeting. When I was filming Queer Eye in secrecy with the boys in Atlanta in 2017, sometimes producers, or people who were familiar with the show\u2019s revival, would ask me, \u201cAre you ready for your life to change?\u201d I always said, \u201cOMG, yes! But this morning, something shifted. People knew who I was, everywhere I went.\n\nThere was a girl who stopped me on the corner of Twenty- Third and Park not long after the show came out. We made eye contact for a split second and it was like an invisible Jackie Chan punched her in the stomach. She doubled over. She took a dramatic step back. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she yelled. \u201cOh my God! Oh my God!\u201d I was so worried about her that I stopped right there and pulled her onto the curb. We sat for a while until she pulled herself together.\n\nWhen people had asked me whether I was ready for my life to change, I don\u2019t think I really understood what they meant. It wasn\u2019t just that strangers would know who I was. It was this other thing that started to happen to me: when I looked in their eyes, sometimes, there was a little voice in my head wondering,Would you still be so excited to meet me if you really knew who I was? If you knew all the things I\u2019d done? If you could see all my parts?\n\nSure, there\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s endlessly positive. But it\u2019s just one part. It\u2019s a beautiful part, a strong part, and an important part, but it\u2019s not all of it. There are other parts I want to show, parts that are a little bit scarier to get into. Like the nagging, insecure part of me that worries my positivity is faker than the hair that covers the chalkboard scalp of Donald Trump. Or the part of me that\u2019s had sex with a ton of people\u2014a lot of whom I wish I hadn\u2019t. What about my irritated part, which isn\u2019t the easiest to deal with if my people-pleasing part has been working overtime. My binge-eating part, my part that just wants to be left alone, or my part that could make you pray for me to catch permanent laryngitis because I can\u2019t stop telling you about the Romanovs, or my cats, or the irony of the GOP that wants low taxes and even lower federal government regulation, unless it comes to regulation of people\u2019s pregnancies, marijuana, or the fundamentally racist state and federal prison systems. Because when you have this much personality, there\u2019s a fear lurking just below the surface: If you knew all of me, you wouldn\u2019t love me anymore. You would no longer want me as your new best friend.\n\nOver the Top by Jonathan Van Ness is published by Simon & Schuster at \u00a320.
