But nevertheless, it was still a defense.\n\nShe publicly chastised Debra Messing, the former \u201cWill & Grace\u201d sitcom star, for calling, via a tweet, for a list to be publicized of all those attending Trump\u2019s Beverly Hills\u2019 fundraiser. Imagine that.\n\nAs a refresher, this is what Messing wrote: \u201cPlease print a list of all attendees please. The public has a right to know.\u201d\n\nWhat Messing really meant by her tweet was to out all the dirty conservatives, and even dirtier Trump supporters, so they might be blacklisted in Hollywood.\n\nAnd it was such a despicable call that even Goldberg \u2014 queen of the daytime talk show liberals, Goldberg herself \u2014 was disgusted.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d she said, on a recent episode of \u201cThe View\u201d reported in The Daily Beast, \u201cthe last time people did this, people ended up killing themselves.\u201d\n\nHer reference was to Joseph McCarthy days in the 1950s, when fears of communist infiltration into America were great \u2014 and when, amid congressional hearings to out these red influences in Hollywood, Wyoming Sen. Lester Hunt killed himself.\n\nShe went on: \u201cThis is not a good idea, OK? Your idea [Messing] of who you don\u2019t want to work with is your personal business. Do not encourage people to print out lists because the next list that comes out, your name will be on and then people will be coming after you. We had something called a blacklist [in the 1950s] and a lot of really good people were accused of stuff. \u2026 And they lost their right to work. You don\u2019t have the right! In this country, people can vote for who they want to. That is one of the great rights of this country.\u201d\n\nWho\u2019d have thought America would arrive at a point when even Goldberg could see the dangers of leftist thinking?\n\nBut that\u2019s it in a nutshell: People in America have the right to vote for their candidates of choice.\n\nNow if only somebody would tell Rep. Joaquin Castro, the brother of one of the lingering Democratic candidates for president, who tweeted in early August a list of 44 San Antonio citizens who donated the maximum amount to Trump for his reelection.\n\nAnd he included this message: \u201cSad to see [these donors] are fueling a campaign of hate that labels Hispanic immigrants as \u2018invaders.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThe problem with leftists \u2014 one problem with the leftists \u2014 is that they still can\u2019t accept Trump won the White House. Their blacklists \u2014 laugh out loud \u2014 are actually winners\u2019 lists.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
