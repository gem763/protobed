The idea is to allow travelers to be with loved ones or friends for longer\n\n'The new regulations allow us to expand our gate pass program that already exists for our Westin hotel guests,' Wayne County Airport Authority CEO Chad Newton said to ClickOnDetroit.\n\n'Now we can welcome more community members into our home to create memorable moments - from watching planes to greeting family and friends.'\n\nBut the scheme did not seem to appeal to many potential travelers who took time to voice the opposition on Twitter.\n\n'This is so stupid. That's what we need. More people in tsa lines' wrote one. 'All these people in the comments who never flew before 9/11 and only know the unnecessary clampdowns that followed,' said another.\n\nSeveral Twitter users seemed in favour of the change in tact. 'I'm really happy about this! Now, we can see family members off and be there to receive them as well,' one person wrote.\n\n'Should be a boost to the romantic comedy industry,' joked another.\n\n'This is so stupid.

Up to 75 visitor passes per day will be issued.\n\nIt means that people who don't have a flight to catch will be able to visit restaurants, greet arriving travelers or spend times with loved ones before they get on a plane. surprise arriving travelers or spend extra time with loved ones scheduled to depart.\n\nThose wishing to pass through security must apply for a pass through the airport's website the day before their visit - they will be emailed when approved.\n\nThe airport will issue 75 'gate passes' a day every day except Mondays\n\nApplicants will receive an email notification upon approval, as well as detailed instructions. They must submit to the same security regulations as airplane passengers.\n\nVisitors under 18 years old must be accompanied by an adult.\n\nDuring peak departure times, priority in the checkpoint line will be given to ticketed passengers trying to catch flights, officials say.\n\nThe DTW Destination Pass will start as a trial with it ending on January 5.\n\nThe scheme already operates at three other U.S. airports including Pittsburgh, Seattle Tacoma and Tampa.", "description": "Passengers without a ticket will be allowed to clear security at Detroit airport.
