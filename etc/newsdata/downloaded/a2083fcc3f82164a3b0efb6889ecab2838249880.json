All 737 Max 8s were grounded after the latter crash.\n\nDemocratic senator Richard Blumenthal said Boeing supplied 'flying coffins' by concealing the anti-stall software from pilots, saying it was mentioned just once in the 1,600-page pilot manual.\n\nMuilenburg said he was 'heartbroken' by the fatalities. The committee also looked at internal messages, which Boeing had not originally handed to investigators. In them, chief test pilot Mark Forkner said the software was erratic in 2016.\n\nRepublican senator Ted Cruz asked: 'What does that say about Boeing? Why did you not act before 346 people died?'", "description": "The Senate commerce committee said it had serious concerns that Boeing put profits before safety, as it sought approval to get the 737s aircraft back in the air.", "authors": ["City", "Finance Reporter For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
