The lines for the new 11 might not be as long as they once were, there\u2019s clearly still a lot of excitement around any Apple. It just has little to do with the iPhone.\n\nInvestment research firm CFRA is keeping its 12-month price target on Apple at $240. And it\u2019s seeing potential in the company outside of its flagship phone. CFRA Analyst Angelo Zino sees upside in services, wearables, and a chance of growth with 5G devices hitting the market sometime next year. A 5G launch would support a boost in EPS and help expand its brand.\n\n\u201cI think all eyes are going to be on that potential 5G cycle in late 2020,\u201d Zino said. \u201cSo if they were to miss on the iPhone side of things, and expectations needed to be ratcheted down for this upcoming cycle, investors are looking to overlook that given what\u2019s ahead for the fall of 2020.\u201d\n\nAccessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which weren\u2019t all that well-received when they first came out, look to be a crucial part of the company\u2019s portfolio. At the event, Apple also officially announced the next generation of the Apple Watch, the Apple Watch Series 5. Zino pointed out that, \u201cas we see greater representation on services, as well as wearables, we think [services and wearables] will represent about 30% of revenue in 2020.\u201d\n\nItems that seemed like second or third-tier products look to be crucial for Apple, but what about the iPhone?\n\nZino is calling the upcoming iPhones part of \u201canother lackluster upgrade\u201d cycle. The 2020 fiscal year expects future declines of its signature product. There is some promise in the fall of 2020 with the rollout of 5G. Zino says if the 5G launch disappoints, it \u201ccould have an impact on our expectations.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you can see that over time less emphasis on the iPhone side of things. And we see that as a great thing for investors, as its somewhat de-risks the Apple portfolio to some extent,\u201d he said.\n\nMore Apple coverage:\n\nApple TV+ finally gets its price: $4.99 per month\n\nApple announces new 7th generation iPad\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Today\u2019s Apple event may usher in a new era for the tech giant.
