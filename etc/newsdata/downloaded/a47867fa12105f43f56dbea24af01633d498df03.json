Whether the rudimentary bedroom electronica of 2006\u2019s Pip Paine (Pay the \u00a35000 You Owe) or the Motown genuflections of 2014\u2019s Love Letters, each LP has had its own distinctive sound. Metronomy Forever, however, is a wilfully eclectic glide through seemingly disparate genres, often within the same song. That it works is testament to mainman Joe Mount\u2019s pop nous, which has evidently been further honed by his recent work with Robyn.\n\nLately is gorgeous synth-pop; Whitsand Bay is delicately understated languorous indie; the angular rock of Insecurity swaggers more than its title suggests; and Sex Emoji (yes, I\u2019m afraid so) channels Parade-era Prince. Upset My Girlfriend, meanwhile, blends downbeat acoustic strumming and emo lyrical introspection with a parping synth line that ought to be incongruous but fits the melancholy mood. Elsewhere, elements of yacht rock, funk and 80s disco flash in and out of songs. There\u2019s so much to take in that it requires many listens before all of Metronomy Forever\u2019s charms reveal themselves, in part because of the palate-cleansing interstitial drones spread across the album. It\u2019s worth the wait.", "description": "(Because Music)", "authors": ["Phil Mongredien"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de7e373b90829e7343b6c1b3f6f5a2f4220c2ff9/0_282_5718_3432/master/5718.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=aab91f8599651dab0133bbd4d6f1c576", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
