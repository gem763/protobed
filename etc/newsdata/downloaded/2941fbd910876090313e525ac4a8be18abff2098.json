This sort of conduct can lead to a fine of up to \u00a31,000.\n\nThat's because under the Crime and Disorder Act, both swearing and performing rude gestures, such as sticking your middle finger up whilst driving, are classed as 'disorderly behaviour' .\n\nAnd it's surprisingly common. Research from insurer Marmalade found two driving instructors in three (66%) reported offensive hand gestures regularly being made at their students.\n\nThe research also shows male drivers are the worst offenders - with 25 to 40 year olds the most likely to be abusive.\n\n(Image: GETTY)\n\nAA head of roads policy Jack Cousens said: \u201cA small minority of drivers think that being sat in their car exempts them from an offence like this.\n\n\u201cHowever, this kind of anti-social behaviour can land you in hot water and take you on an expensive trip to the courts.\n\n\u201cRoad users have a duty of care to each other, so keeping your cool and remaining focused is important.\n\n\"Your hands should remain on the wheel and your eyes on the road.\n\n\u201cRather than let the tailgater get under your skin, where safe to do so, it is better to let them pass so you can carry on your journey in a calm manner.\u201d", "description": "Giving in to road rage after being cut-up could be an incredibly expensive mistake if you're caught on camera", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12194541.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PROD-Enraged-male-driver-shouts-and-gestures-threateningly.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
