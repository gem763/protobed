We are in ongoing contact with the company and we continue to gather information. Safety is NHTSA\u2019s top priority and the agency will not hesitate to act if it finds evidence of a safety-related defect.\u201d\n\nMy thought bubble: Without any clear regulations on automated vehicles, the NHTSA needs to crack down on beta-testing such features on the public.", "description": "If the software is found unsafe, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could order a recall.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/mTH2jNJr9jI4Ze__FVtflBVCfTs=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/04/1570214383219.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
