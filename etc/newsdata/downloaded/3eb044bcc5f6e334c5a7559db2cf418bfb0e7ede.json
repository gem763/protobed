The 20 best UK festivals for 2019 1/20 All Points East (24 May-2 June) In its second year, All Points East asserts itself as a serious competitor to some of London\u2019s most longstanding music festivals. Taking over Field Day\u2019s position in Victoria Park, Hackney, this 10-day event includes headliners like The Strokes, Christine and the Queens, Bon Iver, Bring Me the Horizon and Chemical Brothers. Each day\u2019s lineup tends to reflect the headliner, so The Strokes are preceded by performances from The Raconteurs, Interpol, Johnny Marr and Courtney Barnett; you can catch James Blake, Kamasi Washington and Princess Nokia before Christine and the Queens, while Bring Me the Horizon curated their own lineup, including Architects, Run the Jewels and Alice Glass. Last year\u2019s inaugural highlights included The XX (pictured). Jordan Curtis Hughes 2/20 BBC\u2019s Big Weekend (25-26 May) With the BBC\u2019s considerable weight backing this location-hopping festival, fans have become used to an event that hosts some of the biggest names in pop. This year is no different: Miley Cyrus, Stormzy, Anne-Marie, Charli XCX (pictured), Sigrid, Vampire Weekend and Two Door Cinema Club are all performing at Stewart Park in Middlesbrough. Rex 3/20 Slam Dunk (25-26 May) Fans seeking a nostalgia-drenched weekend of pop-punk, metal and alternative music need look no further than Slam Dunk, which more than delivers on both fresh and familiar faces. This year you can catch All Time Low (pictured), Bullet For My Valentine, The Mezingers, Plain White T\u2019s (yep) and Employed to Serve. Saturday\u2019s action takes place at Temple Newsham Park, Leeds, on the Saturday, while the following day the circus moves to Hatfield Park, Hertfordshire. Redferns 4/20 The Ends (31 May-2 June) We\u2019re taking a bit of a punt on this one, as it\u2019s actually a brand new festival in Croydon, but the lineup is too good to ignore. Organisers felt this part of London had been somewhat neglected in the past, but they\u2019re more than making up for it now. It\u2019s an absolutely massive lineup, featuring headliners Nas, Wizkid and Damian Marley (pictured), plus De La Soul, J Balvin, Ghetts, Kojey Radical, Nao and Nadia Rose to name but a few. AFP/Getty Images 5/20 Field Day (7-8 June) This year marks Field Day\u2019s move to a brand new location in Enfield, north London, but that doesn\u2019t mean the festival\u2019s knack for rounding up some of the most thrilling live artists has changed. They\u2019ve managed to nab Skepta (pictured) in a headline slot, which will take place right after the release of his new album Ignorance is Bliss. Jorja Smith, Diplo, Pusha-T, Bonobo (DJ set), Octavian and many more have also been announced. Getty 6/20 Parklife (8-9 June) Parklife in Manchester consistently boasts one of the best lineups of any UK festival that year. This year, they\u2019ve outdone themselves by getting Solange, The Streets, Cardi B, George Ezra, Migos, Christine and the Queens, Nas, Kaytranada, Jungle, Mark Ronson, Loyle Carner, AJ Tracey, Octavian, Yxng Bane, Earl Sweatshirt, slowthai and Peggy Gou on the same billing. Parklife 2017/FANATIC 7/20 Download (14-16 June) The UK\u2019s biggest rock festival is always a blast, which has a lot to do with its friendly albeit incredibly rowdy atmosphere. This year, organisers have invited Slipknot (pictured), Def Leppard and Tool to headline, as well as Enter Shikari, Rob Zombie, Skindred, Lamb of God and Blackberry Smoke. Getty Images 8/20 Black Deer (21-23 June) With country music growing in popularity among UK audiences, it was only a matter of time before the genre got its own festival. Black Deer is a lovingly curated event comprising some well-known US country music staples, but also a number of British folk, country and American acts carving out impressive careers of their own. Plus there's really good BBQ. 9/20 Glastonbury (26-30 June) It\u2019s back! Returning after its traditional fallow year, Glastonbury is the biggest UK festival of 2019. Maybe you\u2019re not impressed with the headliners (Stormzy, The Cure, The Killers), but as any Glasto veteran will tell you, that\u2019s not what this festival is about. It\u2019s about the atmosphere, which is like nothing else, and the chance to stumble upon a new or previously unknown artist who might just change your life. Getty Images 10/20 British Summer Time (5-14 July) Possibly the most convenient festival in the UK, at least in terms of access and transport, British Summer Time takes place in London\u2019s Hyde Park. Organisers were apparently intent on securing legends this year, so headliners include Celine Dion (pictured), Stevie Wonder and Barbra Streisand, plus Florence + the Machine, Robbie Williams, Bryan Ferry, The National, Blood Orange and Nadine Shah. The weather is usually excellent around this time (sorry if this jinxes it) so make sure you take some sunscreen. Rex 11/20 2000 Trees (11-13 July) Trees (11-13 July) Six friends sat together after a few (perhaps many) drinks and realised they had become disillusioned with a festival they had been attending for the past few years. They decided to start their own. Twelve years later and this small but mighty event is still going from strength to strength, with a stellar lineup and wonderful community atmosphere at Upcote Farm, Gloucestershire, all surrounded by the stunning Cotswold Hills. Gareth Bull 12/20 Lovebox (12-13 July) Lovebox has outdone itself this year by securing a wealth of talent to perform in its new west London home of Gunnersbury Park, from US stars like Chance the Rapper (pictured) and Solange to homegrown talent including J Hus, Giggs and Loyle Carner. AP 13/20 Bluedot (18-21 July) Held at the Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire, this three-day festival has a lineup to make any electronic music fan starry-eyed. Headliners this year are Hot Chip (pictured), Kraftwerk and New Order, while lower down the bill but no less excellent are Jon Hopkins, Gruff Rhys, John Grant, Sons of Kemet, Anna Calvi, Omar Souleyman and KOKOKO! Getty Images for FYF 14/20 Womad (25-28 July) \u201cWomad's great strength is its eclecticism,\u201d read our review of last year\u2019s festival. \u201cThere are bands from right across the globe, offering glimpses into lesser-known musical traditions from more than 50 countries, or slamming them together in unexpected combinations.\u201d Taking place at Charlton Park, near Malmesbury in Wiltshire, organisers are continuing that tradition in 2019, with a lineup including Orbital, Ziggy Marley, Youssef, Bantou Mentale and Dakhabrakha. Victor Frankowski 15/20 Standon Calling (25-28 July) Set in beautiful Hertfordshire, Standon Calling is a family friendly festival that manages to curate an impressively diverse and current lineup each year. Along with plenty of entertainment for adults and children, guests can watch performances from the likes of Nile Rodgers and Chic, Wolf Alice, Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man, Echo and the Bunnymen, IDLES and Lewis Capaldi. Justine Trickett 16/20 Boomtown (7-12 August) Music and mayhem go hand in hand at this spectacular and creative event. Composed of several districts built across the sprawling hills of Hampshire, Boomtown has a surprise around every corner. Now in its 11th chapter, the festival\u2019s lineup is as wildly eclectic as ever. Look out for the likes of Bedouin Soundclash, Kabaka Pyramid, Nova Twins, Lauryn Hill, Che Lingo, Four Tet, Hak Baker, Little Gay Brother, She Drew the Gun and This is the Kit. Boomtown Fair 17/20 ArcTanGent (15-17 August) This popular event is where you\u2019ll find the biggest and best names in metal, math rock and experimental music. You might think this sounds a bit niche, but it\u2019s a surprisingly welcoming festival for people of all musical tastes, and there\u2019s so much eclecticism within the lineup you\u2019re bound to find a few things you love. It takes place at idyllic Fernhill Farm, 10 miles from Bristol. Ed Sprake 18/20 Green Man (15-18 August) One of the best independent festivals in the UK, Green Man has rounded up a solid set of artists to perform in the gorgeous Brecon Beacons \u2013 not to mention showcases for literature, poetry, film, comedy and theatre. On this year\u2019s stages you can catch Yo La Tengo, Eels, Sharon Van Etten, Khruangbin, Car Seat Headrest, Aldous Harding, Julia Jacklin and more. Max Miechowski 19/20 Creamfields (22-25 August) This massive festival is essentially an A-Z of the dance music scene. Above & Beyond, Calvin Harris, Camelphat, Peggy Gou, Martin Garrix and Dillon Francis (plus many more) will ensure fans in the Cheshire countryside keep dancing into the early hours. 20/20 End of the Road (29 August-1 September) The event that serves as a kind of closer to UK festival season is also one of the biggest. Its lineup is arguably stronger than it has been the past few years, with Michael Kiwanuka (pictured) appearing in his debut headline slot, plus Beirut, Metronomy, Courtney Barnett, Mitski, Courtney Barnett and Parquet Courts, making this an indie music fan\u2019s dream come true. Head to Larmer Tree Gardens, near Blandford, in Dorset. 1/20 All Points East (24 May-2 June) In its second year, All Points East asserts itself as a serious competitor to some of London\u2019s most longstanding music festivals.
