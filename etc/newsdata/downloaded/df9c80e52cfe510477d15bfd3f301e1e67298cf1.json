But he also famously stood and linked arms with his players during the national anthem before a game in September 2017, amid the height of the player protests that Colin Kaepernick started and Trump so vehemently and vocally criticized. Khan, a Muslim who immigrated to America from Pakistan, also publicly opposed Trump\u2019s travel ban on five majority-Muslim countries.\n\nThose actions may appear to contradict each other. And now, two years after the NFL protests faded and TV ratings for the league have rebounded, Khan says he is still a fan of some of Trump\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cI had been a big fan of the economic policies,\u201d Khan said on stage at Yahoo Finance\u2019s All Markets Summit on Thursday. \u201cThat happened, and I think we are benefiting from it.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Khan added, \u201cI think it\u2019s very clear on social issues\u2014immigration, religion, what have you\u2014I think we need to have a different viewpoint.\u201d\n\nKhan is hardly the only business leader to say that he likes Trump\u2019s economic policies, but not his social approach. Khan is CEO of car bumper maker Flex-N-Gate, which supplies parts to the biggest automakers in the world and had $7.5 billion in revenue in 2018. \u201cI think with manufacturing\u2014I\u2019ve been on a factory floor 50 years, and this is about the best it\u2019s ever been,\u201d Khan said. \u201cThe factories are going through a huge revolution. New technology, more brains, less brawn.\u201d\n\nLooking back at the NFL protests and their lasting impact, Khan says, \u201cThose were human causes that [the players] brought a lot of attention to. And since then, the league has done a lot. We\u2019d need a special program with you to go through all the stuff. And the players have done a lot. That was the time for talk and symbolism; since then, it\u2019s been time for action. And there\u2019s been a lot of action. Local communities, prison reform, a lot of those things that impact not only minorities but other people.\u201d\n\nKhan also declares \u201cthe best days of the NFL are ahead of it, especially now with international availability.\u201d\n\nJacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan participates in the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit at Union West on Thursday, Oct. 10, 2019, in New York.

There\u2019s no issue as far as that goes, whether it\u2019s NFL or anybody else,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWe are American citizens, we have a social civic responsibility to be active in causes we believe in. But do we have that same responsibility to opine on sovereign matters in other countries? That\u2019s the critical issue.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to doing business in China, Khan says, \u201cYou have to respect the norms.\u201d\n\nYou can watch Jaguars owner Shad Khan\u2019s full interview at the Oct. 10 Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit here.\n\n\u2014\n\nDaniel Roberts is the sports business writer at Yahoo Finance.
