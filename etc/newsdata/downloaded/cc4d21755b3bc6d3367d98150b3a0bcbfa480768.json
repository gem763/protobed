His style, his mode of observation, his subject matter have all become so ingrained in contemporary photography that one can gauge their impact only by the derision that rained down upon him from mainstream critics.\n\nFrank\u2019s images broke most of the conventions of photography. They were not artfully framed or carefully balanced. They comprised \u201cmeaningless blur, grain, muddy exposures, drunken horizons and general sloppiness\u201d, in the dismissive words of Popular Photography.\n\nNo US publisher would touch the book at first. It was first published in 1958 as Les Am\u00e9ricains by the Parisian publisher Robert Delpire, in an edition garlanded by commentary from an extraordinary collection of writers \u2013 Simone de Beauvoir, William Faulkner, Henry Miller, John Steinbeck and others. The following year, it was finally published in the US, with an introduction by Jack Kerouac. \u201cWith one hand,\u201d Kerouac observed, \u201che sucked a sad poem right out of America on to film.\u201d\n\nThe book was the product of a two-year road trip across the nation. Breaking photographic conventions allowed Frank to capture a different America. He shot in gas stations and diners; he photographed cowboys and factory workers. There are photographs with smiles, but mostly it is a portrait of the melancholy and tension beneath the gloss and self-satisfaction of postwar America. They are images that seem as meaningful today as they were 60 years ago.\n\n\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist", "description": "His once-derided images broke all the conventions of 1950s photography, but they still resonate today", "authors": ["Kenan Malik"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e3136479c564a948907d11b2eb666db04c84c4f/0_0_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4c8749483652731acc925627c24e2ec6", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
