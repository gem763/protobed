Terry Graham asked Steinaker, 43, to come to the cockpit so he could use the restroom.\n\nA Southwest Airlines flight attendant claims she caught two pilots livestreaming footage from the plane bathroom onto an iPad in the cockpit\n\nSouthwest Airline policy requires at least two crew members be present in the cockpit at all times.\n\nWhen Steinaker entered the cockpit, she allegedly saw an iPad mounted on a windshield near Graham's seat.\n\nThe lawsuit says it was playing a livestream of the plane's lavatory and Steinaker could see what appeared to be Graham inside the bathroom.\n\nShe asked the co-pilot Ryan Russell, who was also in the cockpit, to confirm the iPad's footage.\n\nThe lawsuit says: 'Plaintiff Renee Steinaker immediately asked Russel whether the iPad was \"live streaming\" from the camera in the forward lavatory. Russell admitted that it was live streaming.'\n\n'Russell advised Plaintiff Renee Steinaker that there was a camera in the lavatory and that it was hidden so that no on would ever find it.'\n\n'Russell directed Plaintiff Renee Steinaker not to tell anyone about the camera or the recordings because they were on the \"downlow\".'\n\nRussell told Steinaker that the cameras were new and that all Southwest Airlines' 737-800s had them.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that co-pilot Ryan Russell told Steinaker that the cameras were 'hidden so that no on would ever find it'\n\nThe lawsuit accuses Southwest Airlines of retaliating against Steinaker and other crew members for coming forward with the allegations, including stalking and 'random' drug tests\n\nSteinaker's attorney Ronald L.M. Goldman told Arizona Republic that the pilots revealed she and others had been recorded.\n\n'They led her to believe that she and others had been filmed \u2014 had been videotaped if you will \u2014 while they were using the lavatory. It's really hard to imagine a more outrageous kind of conduct,' he said.\n\nIn response, Steinaker took a photo of the iPad with her phone to document the incident and showed fellow attendants the alleged evidence.\n\nSteinaker and other crew members reported the incident to the airline, but were reportedly told not to talk about the incident.\n\n'If this got out, if this went public,' an official allegedly said, 'no one, I mean no one, would ever fly our airline again.'\n\nGraham and Russell were permitted to continue onto their next flight and are currently still flying with the company.\n\nIn addition to that claim, the lawsuit says the pilots violated airline protocol and 'disembarked, leaving the aircraft unattended by piloting staff.'\n\nGraham is also accused of leaving 'a loaded firearm unattended in the cockpit, a violation of FAA regulations.'\n\nSouthwest Airlines denied having cameras inside airplane bathrooms in a statement to Arizona Republic\n\nDavid Steinaker, Renee's husband and fellow Southwest flight attendant, claim that they are the victims of retaliation after going to airline officials.\n\nThe say the airline 'engaged in a pattern of retaliation and monitoring efforts to silence and intimidate' the couple and other crew members.\n\nThey say they were stalked, faced in increase in performance audits and were given 'random' drug and alcohol testing.\n\nGoldman said: 'In my view, Southwest Airlines has treated this as \"how dare they report it\" rather than \"thank you for letting us know\".'\n\n'In my opinion as an aviation lawyer with many years of experience, this does compromise the safety of flight and the safety of passengers, not even to mention for the potential of violating the privacy of all of the passengers as well as the crew.'\n\nSouthwest Airlines released a statement to Arizona Republic denying that their planes have cameras in the bathrooms.\n\nIt said: 'The safety and security of our employees and customers is Southwest\u2019s uncompromising priority. As such, Southwest does not place cameras in the lavatories of our aircraft. At this time, we have no other comment on the pending litigation.'\n\nBoth pilots have denied the claims.", "description": "A Southwest Airlines flight attendant is suing the company after she claims two pilots were livestreaming footage from the plane bathroom to an iPad and officials targeted her for speaking up", "authors": ["Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/16/20218798-0-image-a-31_1572102660403.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
