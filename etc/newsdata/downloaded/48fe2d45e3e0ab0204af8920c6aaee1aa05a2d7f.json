The Fremont Union High School District said in a statement that Persky applied over the summer and completed all of the district\u2019s hiring requirements, including a fingerprint background check.\n\nRECALLED CALIFORNIA JUDGE ASKS FOR HELP TO PAY LEGAL DEBT\n\n\u201cHe was a highly qualified applicant, having attended several tennis coaching clinics for youth and holds a high rating from the United States Tennis Association,\u201d the district\u2019s statement said.\n\nLynbrook High School held a meeting Monday with the parents of JV and varsity girls\u2019 tennis teams in response to the community\u2019s concerns over Persky\u2019s employment.\n\n\u201cOur focus remains on ensuring that our students have the best possible educational experience \u2013 both academically and athletically,\u201d the statement added.\n\nIn 2016, Persky sentenced Turner to six months behind bars after a jury found the then 18-year-old college sophomore guilty of sexually assaulting an intoxicated, unconscious woman outside an on-campus fraternity party. Two Swedish graduate students found Turner on top of the woman\u2019s half-naked body.\n\nThe former judge ignored the prosecutors\u2019 recommendation of a seven-year sentence, prompting critics to launch a recall effort in mid-2016 in what is considered one of the first tests of the #MeToo movement's political strength. Turner was released early on good behavior after just three months and was required to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life.\n\n\n\nMore than 60 percent of Santa Clara County voters who went to the polls voted to recall Persky in June 2018. He is only the fifth judge in California history to be removed from office before serving his full term and the first to be ousted in 86 years, Mercury News reported.\n\nThe case garnered national attention when BuzzFeed published the victim\u2019s 7,000-word emotional account of the attack and its aftermath, which she read in court during Turner\u2019s sentencing hearing. The statement eventually was read on the floor of the U.S. Capitol during a congressional session.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe woman who Turner sexually assaulted, previously identified in court documents under the pseudonym \u201cEmily Doe,\u201d revealed her name last week: Chanel Miller. She is scheduled to release a memoir titled \u201cKnow My Name,\u201d on Sept. 24.\n\nFox News\u2019 Bradford Betz contributed to this report.", "description": "The former California superior court judge who was ousted by voters in 2018 after receiving harsh backlash over his handling of former Sanford University swimmer and convicted sex offender Brock Turner\u2019s case will rejoin the workforce a year later as a public high school tennis coach this fall, the school district said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/12/a0e19110-Judge1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
