By standardizing hardware, the platform should allow new vendors to compete on software.\n\nThe new technology, which Vodafone has also deployed in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Mozambique, will provide 2G, 3G and 4G services for now, \"with 5G possible over OpenRAN in the future,\" Vodafone said.\n\nOne of the major equipment suppliers, China's Huawei, is the target of a US campaign that seeks to discourage mobile network operators from using its equipment on national security grounds.\n\nHuawei denies that its products pose a risk, but some countries have sought to limit use of its equipment and others are looking into the issue. The conflict has meant tough choices for mobile operators building 5G networks.\n\nStill, OpenRAN represents a tiny share of the telecoms equipment market and this is unlikely to change considerably in the near future, said Julian Bright, a senior analyst at Ovum.\n\n\"It's hard to see 5G as an inflection point where suddenly OpenRAN is going to gain significant market share,\" he told CNN Business.\n\nTelecom operators are already embarking on vendor selections for 5G and the tendency is to procure the bulk of their 5G equipment supply from existing suppliers, Bright said.\n\nBut Paul Triolo, global technology policy director at Eurasia Group, said that it would take a decade to roll 5G out on a standalone basis, by which time OpenRAN may be positioned to play a bigger role.\n\nVodafone's goal\n\nVodafone is seeking to \"actively expand\" its vendor ecosystem, CEO Nick Read said in a statement.\n\nThe company has already started working with a number of new vendors supplying OpenRAN technology, including US companies Parallel Wireless and Mavenir, and UK-based Lime Microsystems.\n\n\"OpenRAN improves the network economics enabling us to reach more people in rural communities and that supports our goal to build digital societies in which no-one is left behind,\" Read said.\n\nMore than 100 possible locations across the United Kingdom had been identified for OpenRAN trials, a Vodafone spokesperson told CNN Business. This list would be narrowed further to 55.\n\nBy testing the technology in a market as big as the United Kingdom, Vodafone could help upstarts to attract financing and eventually scale to rival existing vendors, said Usman Ghazi, an analyst at Berenberg.\n\nThe UK trials are Vodafone's first in a developed market.", "description": "Vodafone is testing technology in Europe that could break the stranglehold on telecom equipment enjoyed by Ericsson, Nokia and Huawei.", "authors": ["Hanna Ziady", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191007035938-vodafone-5g-telecom-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
