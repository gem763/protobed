We have one! It\u2019s a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions.\u201d\n\nThe Commission chief wrote in his letter: \u201cAs regards the withdrawal agreement itself, negotiations focused on the protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland [ie, the backstop] and sought to identify a mutually satisfactory solution to address the specific circumstances on the island of Ireland.\n\n\u201cThe negotiators also discussed the political declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom. Their aim was to adjust the political declaration in a way that reflects the different level of ambition now sought by the government of the United Kingdom for the country\u2019s future relationship with the European Union.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe it is high time to complete the withdrawal process and move on, as swiftly as possible, to the negotiation on the European Union\u2019s future partnership with the United Kingdom,\u201d he added.\n\n\ud83c\uddfa Where there is a will, there is a #deal \u2013 we have one!

If the other EU nation-leaders back the proposal, the agreement would go to the British parliament on Saturday for a vote.\n\nDoubt remains whether there is enough support in the House of Commons to pass a withdrawal agreement bill, with key player the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) sceptical that the deal in its current form was acceptable.\n\nSupport from the Northern Irish unionist party is key for the minority Conservative government. In a joint statement released on Thursday morning, before news of the agreed deal broke, DUP leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds said that \u201cas things stand, we could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues and there is a lack of clarity on VAT\u201d.\n\nMrs Foster and Mr Dodds added: \u201cWe will continue to work with the government to try and get a sensible deal that works for Northern Ireland and protects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nPost-announcement, the DUP was reported to have said: \u201cRead our statement. It hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d\n\nThis story is developing\u2026", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that a new Brexit deal has been brokered between the UK and the EU.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/BoJo-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
