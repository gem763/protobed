To reward them, of course.\n\nFast-forward to now, and neoliberalism feels on the brink of implosion (or has it died already?). Fantasies about eternal economic expansion have been debunked with the sobering fact that our planet is quite literally burning because of it; the Tories celebrate the UK\u2019s \u201cprosperous\u201d position as the fifth largest economy (while ignoring that it\u2019s also one of the most unequal, with 14 million people living in poverty according to the UN); and capitalism\u2019s false promise that we\u2019ll all be private owners should we work hard enough (or have the gift of circumstance, or choose to willingly exploit workers), is coupled with the West\u2019s rapid intolerance of anybody else who might hope for a slice of it.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

For context, according to the BBC, there has been an 81 per cent rise in transphobic hate crimes this year. The abuse trans people are faced with online is nothing short of inhumane.\n\nThe growing visibility of transgender identities has been countered by a surge of transphobic commentators across mainstream media. Their arguments range from the nonsensical to the outrageously offensive, more often than not arguing that gender is entirely biologically determined \u2013 \u201cif you don\u2019t have a vagina, you have no right to be a woman,\u201d or so the argument goes. The belief that all womanhood is centred around the womb not only regresses us from the complexity of gender into stark binary categorisation but feels aligned with some key tenants of capitalist thinking. For it is predicated on a question of private ownership: \u201cWho has the right to own womanhood?\u201d\n\nI have read the argument that trans access to women\u2019s services is an act of thievery, in effect taking something that cisgender women \u201cown\u201d. Rather than construe women\u2019s services as a right to be democratically distributed between cisgender and trans women \u2013 for both are women and subject to patriarchal violence (trans women more so) \u2013 what we see is a power play, eerily mirroring right-wing capitalist rhetoric. This refusal to share space or \u201cearned\u201d privilege is not only the selfish economic core of neoliberal ideology, it is at the heart of the anti-trans lobby.\n\nWe see this in last week\u2019s arrival of the LGB-alliance, a group set up by a barrister who terrifyingly threatens that \u201cgender extremism has met its match\u201d in her movement which is fighting to extricate trans people from the LGBT movement. The argument is that trans people \u2013 who, let us not forget, have been at the forefront of the emancipation of LGTBQIA+ the world over \u2013 are consuming the resources of cisgender lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. It is, in effect, an act of border control on identity: \u201cIf you get your rights, will we be less well off?!\u201d The answer is, of course: \u201cWe barely have any rights (but still fought for you to get yours).\u201d\n\nThis capitalism-on-crack mentality partly explains the co-option of gay votes by the far-right \u2013 most notably in 2017, when a third of gay married (mostly-white) men in Paris voted for Marine Le Pen in France\u2019s presidential election, persuaded as they were that Islam was coming to ransack their civil rights.\n\nIt is thus no surprise that many transphobic \u201cfeminists\u201d are politically aligned with the far right. One anti-trans campaigner happily spoke on a podcast with neo-Nazi Richard Spencer (a man who has called for a \u201cwhite ethnostate\u201d), all to argue that women\u2019s rights should be protected from trans people.\n\nThe core objective of feminism to dismantle all forms of oppression is always abandoned by anti-trans campaigners. This struggle has played out in feminist circles over and over, most notably among white feminists who have refused to acknowledge intersectionality and the incorporation of racial justice in the fight for women\u2019s rights.\n\nSociety \u2013 humanity, really \u2013 is at a turning point. Some stay deludedly wedded to capitalist systems of thought, with all the division and heartbreak we know will ensue. But many are fighting for a truly democratic alternative. If we opt for the latter, there\u2019s hope that social equality won\u2019t also be dictated by those whose main aspiration is an illusory sense of power.\n\nAmrou Al-Kadhi is a writer, performer and filmmaker, and author of Unicorn: The Memoir of a Muslim Drag Queen", "description": "One of the most extraordinary things about capitalism is its inability to conceive of a world without it.
