The company had already sold its stake in the Hulu streaming service and its New York offices in the debt-reduction effort, reaping a total of $3.6 billion.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\n\u201cThe sale of AT&T\u2019s operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands will further relieve pressure on the company to delever and allow for the allocation of more free cash flow to share buybacks in 4Q.\u201d\n\nJohn Butler, telecom analyst.\n\nClick here to read the research.\n\nIn all, including Wednesday\u2019s deal and cash-flow-management steps, AT&T said it has raised a net $11 billion this year, exceeding its goal of $6 billion to $8 billion. The company reports its third-quarter earnings Oct. 23 and has an investor day scheduled for Oct. 29 to offer an update on its WarnerMedia entertainment and media strategy.\n\nFor Liberty Latin America, part of U.S. cable pioneer John Malone\u2019s global empire, the deal furthers regional expansion ambitions. The AT&T assets in the sale include cellular, landline and internet businesses. Denver-based Liberty operates in more than 20 countries around Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nAT&T said it plans stock buybacks in the fourth quarter, along with more debt cuts. The company\u2019s shares were modestly higher in New York trading Wednesday, having gained 31% this year through Tuesday. Liberty Latin America\u2019s class-A shares rose as much as 6.1% Wednesday.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on the coming sale earlier Wednesday.\n\n(Updates with AT&T statement on valuation in fourth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Scott Moritz.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: John J.
