The player, whose real name is Ng Wai Chung, called for a political revolution amid the ongoing Hong Kong protests. Gaming & Esports consultant Rod \u201cSlasher\u201d Breslau says gaming fans won\u2019t back down.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s anyone more passionate than sports fans in the world, it is the gaming community,\u201d Breslau told Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFI PM. \u201cThey\u2019re probably the most connected, the most digitally aware of what\u2019s going on. When they are really angry at something, they can definitely put together one of the best boycotts in the world.\u201d\n\nBlizzard stripped Ng of his winnings and banned him from competing in next year\u2019s popular Hearthstone tournament for shouting the Hong Kong protest slogan \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\u201d during a livestream. Blizzard says this violates the rules of its competition.\n\nBlizzard players lashed out on social media, posting pictures of their cancelled subscriptions to Blizzard-owned games like World of Warcraft and Overwatch. Competitor Epic Games took advantage of the boycott, saying it will not penalize its own players for political protests.\n\n\u201cI have to say, I\u2019m not totally convinced yet by Epic\u2019s statements,\u201d Breslau said. \u201cI cover Epic for a living and I see what they\u2019re doing. I think it\u2019s definitely an opportunity for them while Activison Blizzard\u2019s getting kicked around.\u201d\n\nMark Kern, a video game designer who led the creation of World of Warcraft took to Twitter to weigh in, saying, \"We are in a situation where unlimited Communist money dictates our American values. We censor our games for China, we censor our movies for China. Now, game companies are silencing voices for freedom and democracy.\"\n\nThe incident comes as tensions between China and the NBA also escalate over the protests. China\u2019s state media cancelled the league\u2019s fan event slated for today in Shanghai after Houston Rockets\u2019 general manager Daryl Morey tweeted a pro-Hong Kong image. Some mainland China fans are reportedly furious with the NBA over the cancellation, while Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta says Morey \u201cdoesn\u2019t speak for the Houston Rockets.\u201d\n\nListen....@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization. @espn https://t.co/yNyQFtwTTi \u2014 Tilman Fertitta (@TilmanJFertitta) October 5, 2019\n\n\u201cEveryone should remember that Tencent really is the key in all of this,\u201d Breslau explained. \u201cTencent 100% owns Riot and League of Legends. They own 45% of Epic Games, which is Fortnite. They own 10% of Activison Blizzard. They own pretty much half of the entire gaming community on top of being the main partner of the NBA.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time Chinese tech giant Tencent (TCEHY) has been entangled with the government. It previously built a system to track how long individual gamers in China spend playing League of Legends, according to the Los Angeles Times. The company reportedly locks out gamers who stay on for more than two hours per day amid accusations of its role in video game addiction.\n\nMeghan Fitzgerald is a producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and reddit.", "description": "Gamers are calling for a boycott against Activision Blizzard after the company banned and stripped prize money away from a top player of its online game \"Hearth-Stone,\" for saying a pro-Hong Kong message on a livestream.", "authors": ["Meghan Fitzgerald"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6Tr0cLc9lySwI0uXmk_8VA--~B/aD0zNDU2O3c9NDYwODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/ee069a80-ead3-11e9-bdf7-5b2ba8a8eb78", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
