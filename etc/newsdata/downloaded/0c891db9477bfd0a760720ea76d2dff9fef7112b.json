When you aren\u2019t on screen in the media, you are being erased. you don\u2019t exist. And the stories from Hollywood don\u2019t come close to representing the complexity of our community. This is a problem \u2014 the demographics of America are changing and it\u2019s changing in a very Latin way, and this cultural shift is freaking people out.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWe in this room have contributed to these negative portrayals and images we\u2019ve seen in the media. We here in Hollywood are largely responsible for much of the unconscious bias that is against people of color. People of color are depicted in very narrow ways on screen and unconscious bias come from those repeated images that come across as a threat. So when you see young black men in movies that are deemed dangerous, or you see young Latino men in movies who are deemed sketchy, you begin to form an opinion, especially when you don\u2019t have interaction with these communities\u2026 It\u2019s those repeated images that normalize the words \u2018criminal,\u2019 \u2018illegal,\u2019 \u2018dangerous,\u2019 which in turn become synonymous with the broader term \u2018Latino.'\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Eva Longoria to Deliver Keynote Address at Power Women Summit 2019\n\nLongoria began her keynote speech by telling the audience a story about when she was 8 years old and was getting on the school bus to go to a new, superior school in a \u201crich\u201d neighborhood. She remembered her mother making her a bean taco for breakfast and her getting on the school bus to receive looks from the other kids eating pop tarts.\n\n\u201cI took my seat next to a blonde girl, and I was holding my bean taco and she was holding her pop tart, and I asked, \u2018what\u2019s that?\u2019 all excited and engaged and she\u2019s like, \u2018what\u2019s THAT?'\u201d Longoria explained. \u201cI heard someone on the bus whisper, \u2018she\u2019s Mexican.\u2019 It was apparently a fact that explained me. I remember thinking, \u2018what\u2019s a Mexican?\u2019 Even though I didn\u2019t know what it meant, I could feel it wasn\u2019t a good thing.\u201d\n\nAll Longoria wanted was to eat pop tarts like the other kids, but her mother told her: \u201c\u2018Never shy away from who you are. You never forget where you came from.\u2019 My mom is a gangster!\u201d She continued, adding that if those kids on the bus saw Latino families on their television screens and on commercials, maybe they would have seen Longoria as the inspiration and wanted her bean taco more than those pop tarts.\n\n\u201cThings haven\u2019t really changed much in the three decades since I\u2019ve been a kid,\u201d Longoria said. \u201cTwo months ago, the Annenberg study came out, and it said that Latinos are 18% of the population of this nation, but we are only 4% represented in film. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s like this or why it persists.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'This Is Us' Star Chrissy Metz: You Can Live 'a Healthy Life' at an 'Unconventional Size'\n\nDuring her opening remarks, TheWrap CEO and Editor in Chief Sharon Waxman said that more women have risen in leadership roles and more inclusion has been achieved behind the camera and in front of it.\n\n\u201cHollywood has a tendency to pat itself on the back every time they have the smallest gain of diversity, they\u2019re like, \u2018We had TWO women direct a movie!'\u201d Longoria said. \u201cEven that word, \u2018diversity,\u2019 is so hip. It falls out of every executive\u2019s mouth\u2026 We should see how many times that word comes up at this summit \u2014 we should make it a drinking game!\u201d\n\nLongoria explained that the images the media puts forward about people of color, and women, is important and we must change the narratives portrayed on screen.\n\n\u201cImages can actually transform what we believe,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we put out there can change the minds of people. Once we change the minds of people, we can change the policy that affect those people. A great example of this is when the films \u2018Hunger Games\u2019 and \u2018Brave\u2019 came out there was some popularity with archery with girls\u2026 When \u2018CSI\u2019 came out, there was a surge in forensic studies across the nation because of a TV show.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "Eva Longoria delivered a powerful and moving keynote at TheWrap\u2019s Power Women Summit in Los Angeles on Friday, saying that people in Hollywood are \u201clargely responsible for much of the unconscious bias that is against people of color\u201d and that \u201cLatinas are the last to find their voices amplified in this", "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kQqtBqJizJutz4AAbJ4omQ--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thewrap.com/d4f41f341243beece93b4990fe5233c4", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
