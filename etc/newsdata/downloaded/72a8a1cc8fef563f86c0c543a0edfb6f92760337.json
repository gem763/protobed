The prime minister of Denmark\u2014of which Greenland is an autonomous territory\u2014has stated the island is not for sale.\n\nYet that\u2019s not stopping travel apps like Hopper from seeing Greenland searches skyrocket over 300% in the wake of the geopolitical saga.\n\n\u201cA spike in the order of [nearly] 340% is totally unforeseen,\u201d Hopper economist Hayley Berg told Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM.\n\nHe added: \u201cwhen something goes into the media in such broad strokes like the Greenland story has, it can pick up global attention. That\u2019s when we really see those massive spikes.\u201d\n\nGreenland has not exactly been high on the priority list for U.S. tourists. Only about 7,000-8,000 American citizens visit per year, according to recent government data. By contrast, 2.36 million traveled to France in 2017.\n\nMelting barriers to travel\n\nOn top of virtually year-round cold temperatures, one of Greenland\u2019s major barriers to attracting more tourists has been its extreme geographic isolation. But Berg predicts the high-profile spat between Trump and Denmark could help change that.\n\nBrightly painted houses with floating iceberg, Qeqertarsuaq, Greenland More\n\n\u201cAs interest grows and if it sustains itself, I can imagine that the [Greenland] tourism board will put some work into making it easier to get there\u2014especially for American citizens,\u201d she said.\n\nThe only international commercial flights currently serving Greenland originate in Iceland and Denmark.\n\n\u201cAccess to destinations is one of the ways that tourism boards are able to increase tourism and interest,\u201d Berg stated. \u201cI think that until there are more direct flights, it\u2019s not likely we\u2019ll see a massive surge.\u201d\n\nWhile options visiting Greenland via air remain limited, Berg noted there are more tour options via sea.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen Greenland add stops on cruises, and they\u2019ve made efforts to make the island more accessible,\u201d she added. Major operators like Princess Cruises (CCL) have recently begun offering itineraries to the territory from cities like New York.\n\nYet one key question remains: How will the recent flurry of travel interest impact tourism-related revenue for the island?\n\n\u201cIt remains to be seen if this will translate into a big surge in bookings of actual flights, Airbnbs, and hotels,\u201d Berg told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll likely see some bump in tourism to Greenland just because of all the type, but it will likely not be in the order of 340%,\u201d she added.\n\nNick Robertson is a senior producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard,SmartNews,LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "President Trump's geopolitical spat with Denmark over a potential U.S. purchase of Greenland is leading to a surge in travel interest for the arctic territory.", "authors": ["Nick Robertson", "Senior Producer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/l7obkINrnzjPnAnW2xuBTA--~B/aD0zNzk1O3c9NTY5MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/4085d240-c9e0-11e9-bfd3-63ce5b24d985", "published_at": "2019-09-01"}
