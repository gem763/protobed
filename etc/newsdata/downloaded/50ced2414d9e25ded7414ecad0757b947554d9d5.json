Mr Johnson branded the Labour leader \u201cfrit\u201d and \u201ca chlorinated chicken\u201d for refusing to sanction the election the prime minister insisted was the only way out of the crisis.\n\nOrdering his MPs to abstain \u2013 because the no-deal blocking bill has not yet passed \u2013 Mr Corbyn said: \u201cThe offer of an election today is like the offer of an apple to Snow White from the wicked Queen.\n\n\u201cBecause what he is offering is not an apple, or even an election, but the poison of no deal.\u201d\n\nThe government actually won the vote on an early election, by 298 votes to 56, but required a two-thirds majority to overturn the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.\n\nAfter the result was revealed, the prime minister taunted his opponent, but gave no clue to his next move to try to break the paralysing Brexit impasse.\n\nMr Johnson said Mr Corbyn had refused to back an election despite previously \u201cleading the chants to stop the coup and let people vote\u201d.\n\n\u201cI can only speculate as to the reasons behind his hesitation.

Several peers had arrived at work with duvets, extra clothes and toiletries to prepare for the dramatic battle.\n\nAnd in a late-night blow to pro-Brexit Tory peers, who were plotting to kill off the bill by tabling more than 100 amendments to filibuster debate, the government said a deal had been struck with Labour to avoid the possibility of weekend sessions.\n\nThe Conservative chief whip, Lord Ashton of Hyde, said all stages of the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 6) Bill will be completed by 5pm on Friday, paving the way for the Commons to consider any amendments on Monday and prepare the bill for royal assent.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
