In a default judgment last night, a California judge ordered Missguided to pay Kardashian West $2.7 million in damages and $59,600 in attorney fees. She also ordered the company to cease using Kardashian West\u2019s trademarks in connection with the \u201csale, marketing, or distribution of its products.\u201d\n\nKardashian West\u2019s original lawsuit made the argument that Missguided profited off of her brand and likeness. The suit included images from Missguided\u2019s website and Instagram that depicted Kardashian West and her outfits. In one example, customers could click on photos of her and be taken to a Missguided page selling a similar look.\n\n\u201cMissguided\u2019s use of Plaintiffs\u2019 marks is likely to cause consumers to mistakenly believe that Plaintiffs are associated with Missguided, or that they sponsor or endorse Missguided and its websites,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cAnd in fact, consumers have already expressed such confusion, suggesting in social media posts and online articles that Plaintiffs must be in a \u2018collaboration\u2019 with Missguided.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why Missguided never responded to Kardashian West\u2019s lawsuit, but it has since deleted an image of her from its Instagram.", "description": "Kim Kardashian West sued fast fashion company Missguided over allegations that it used her brand and likeness to profit.
