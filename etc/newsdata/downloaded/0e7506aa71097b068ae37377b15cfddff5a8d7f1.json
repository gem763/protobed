Hell, no': 2020 Democrat stragglers cite 'movement' as cause to run despite low polls", "language": "en", "text": "They are the stragglers in the Democratic presidential race \u2014 down in the polls and excluded from this week\u2019s debate in Houston but vowing to keep running.\n\nAsk why they refuse to call it quits, and many of the stragglers will tell you they are leading \u201ca movement.\u201d\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who is stuck in the low single digits in the polls, said those calling for her to give up just don\u2019t understand what her anti-war campaign is all about.\n\n\u201cAre you quitting? Hell, no,\u201d Ms. Gabbard, a military combat veteran, declared at a campaign stop in Atlanta.\n\nMs. Gabbard came close to qualifying for the debate Thursday and in some polls outperforms several of the candidates who have made it onto the stage.\n\nRep. Tim Ryan of Ohio does not register in the polls and lags in donors, but he said he won\u2019t be deterred by naysayers.\n\n\u201cWe know that pundits and Washington elites are claiming that we\u2019re \u2018out\u2019 \u2014 but we also know the strength, resiliency, and determination of this movement,\u201d he wrote in a fundraising email.\n\nThough stuck at zero in the polls, Sen. Michael F. Bennet of Colorado recently boasted to Democratic Party activists that he is part of the \u201clet\u2019s beat Donald Trump wing of the Democratic Party\u201d and that his purple state pedigree makes him ideally suited to lead the charge.\n\n\u201cPeople in Iowa, South Carolina and Nevada, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve made up their minds, and I think this race is wide open,\u201d Mr. Bennet told reporters in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\n\nNearly a dozen candidates in the crowded Democratic field soldier on despite having virtually no chance of claiming the nomination.\n\nThey refuse to follow the example of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who promptly gave up her White House quest after failing to qualify for the Houston debate.\n\n\u201cI know this isn\u2019t the result we wanted. We wanted to win this race, but it\u2019s important to know when it\u2019s not your time and to know how you can best serve your community and country,\u201d she said in a video posted on Twitter.\n\nShe was the fifth major candidate to drop out last month, raising the total to six.\n\nThe Democrats have been dropping out sooner than the Republicans did in the 2016 race.\n\nAt this time in 2015, none of the 17 candidates had given up. By the end of September, former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and then-Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin quit. Three more bowed out before the Iowa caucuses in February.\n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio has put an October expiration date on his hobbling run for the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cI think the logical thing to say is I\u2019m going to go and try and make the October debates and if I can, that\u2019s a good reason to keep going forward. If I can\u2019t, I think it\u2019s really tough to conceive of continuing,\u201d he said at a non-campaign event in New York, according to The New York Times.\n\nThose who persevere despite the long odds could be angling for the vice presidential slot or a Cabinet post if Democrats succeed in ousting President Trump. They might hope to raise their profile to run for another office such as senator or governor or land a show on MSNBC.\n\nAll of them insist they still have a shot at the nomination, though.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason these candidates have stayed in the race is that they have nothing to lose by sticking with it and little to gain by dropping out,\u201d said University of Virginia professor Jennifer Lawless, who studies political ambition.\n\nMs. Gabbard and Mr. Ryan are likely headed for easy re-elections to their House seats, and Mr. Bennet is not up for reelection until 2022.\n\nMs. Lawless said Ms. Gabbard\u2019s craving for a Senate seat is well known and that Mr. Ryan last year made a bid for House speaker and could be positioning himself to try again.\n\n\u201cSo why not give it a shot, build some national name recognition and see where it takes them?\u201d said Ms. Lawless. \u201cThere are potential upsides to outperforming expectations and demonstrating an ability to compete on a national stage. They\u2019re also not chipping away at any of the top-tier candidates\u2019 support, so there\u2019s no \u2018spoiler\u2019 problem.\u201d\n\nNew Age author Marianne Williamson\u2019s offbeat campaign has generated buzz but not rising poll numbers. She acknowledged that it is getting more difficult to peel off the \u201clong shot\u201d label that has been applied to her.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m in it. There are the important \u2014 very, very important forces that have to do with the voters, with people,\u201d she said on \u201cAmerica This Week.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get the sense that the voters care about [polls and pundits]. You get the sense that the voters care about the United States of America and what is happening here,\u201d Ms. Williamson said. \u201cYou get a sense sometimes that the media is playing one game, that the politicos are playing one and then the voters are in a different place. And that\u2019s the listening I\u2019m speaking into.\u201d\n\nOthers such as Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam, and retired Navy Adm. Joe Sestak continue to run in relative obscurity.\n\nMillionaire businessman and former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland in July 2017 became the first candidate to enter the race but has struggled ever since. Concentrating his efforts on Iowa, Mr. Delaney hopes for an upset win or at least a surprise finish anywhere near the top in the state\u2019s leadoff caucuses. He is getting 1% of the vote in the Real Clear Politics average of recent Iowa polls.\n\nMr. Delaney\u2019s estimated net worth of more than $200 million allows him to self-fund his campaign. But his pockets are not as deep as billionaire activist Tom Steyer, who is spending at least $100 million to stay in the race.\n\nMr. Delaney said he keeps running because he believes he can win.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve been in Iowa and New Hampshire as I have and you talk to voters, you realize very few voters are even decided at this point. I think we\u2019re going to have a dramatically changing field. I just think there\u2019s a lot of action left in this primary,\u201d he told The Baltimore Sun.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee raised the bar for candidates to get into the party\u2019s third presidential primary debate.\n\nAfter having 20 candidates in the first two debates, 10 qualified for Houston this week: former Vice President Joseph R. Biden; Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernard Sanders of Vermont, Kamala D. Harris of California, Cory A. Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; entrepreneur Andrew Yang; former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas; and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro.\n\nThey met both the polling and the donor thresholds, instead of either, as had been enough to make the first two debates. Each threshold also had been raised. Candidates needed 2% in four recognized polls and 130,000 donors across 20 states, up from 1% in polls or 65,000 donors.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
