You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cSome 60 per cent of children have working parents, and when you\u2019re trying to cover six weeks of care, summer holidays can mean an endless, exhausting and expensive juggling act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder the summer break is such a drain on your finances and that one in 20 parents spends more than \u00a3500 on care over the holiday.\u201d\n\nMagical days out\n\nAnd, of course, many parents will also feel the pressure to entertain their children with exciting, adventurous, maybe even educational days out.\n\nPost Office Money\u2019s Parents\u2019 Summer Spending report revealed that families typically spend \u00a3624 each entertaining their children during the summer holidays \u2013 a 25 per cent jump since 2014.\n\nParents everywhere will be anxiously adding up the cost, working out what\u2019s affordable, taking unpaid leave and doing everything they can to make it affordable.\n\nSome have grandparents to lean on but many do not. So for those anxious, stressed, loving parents who want their children to have fun, want to keep their jobs and want to stay out of debt what is the answer?\n\nThere\u2019s no silver bullet to the cost of summer. Even if schools changed the term times to even out the breaks or if more affordable childcare was available, it\u2019s still going to cost families money to work while the kids are off school.\n\nHowever, there are ways to bring the cost down as much as possible \u2013 and there is still time for parents to do so.\n\nSo before you empty your bank account or max out a credit card to cover the cost of childcare \u2013 and before you get too dejected at the idea of effectively working for free this summer (the writer of this feels your pain!) \u2013 there are steps you can take to get more childcare for less.\n\nHere\u2019s how...\n\nGet your tax breaks\n\nIf you are already able to get childcare vouchers via your employer then that can make a massive difference to the amount you pay for summer cover.\n\nChildcare vouchers aren\u2019t just for nursery, they can be used for after-school clubs, holiday clubs, even some activity and sports clubs. Because parents can buy them out of their pre-tax income, they effectively get their childcare tax-free.\n\nBut the scheme isn\u2019t taking on new parents, so now the option for any new applicants is tax-free childcare.\n\nThat\u2019s good news in many ways, it means that the self-employed can finally access a tax-break on their childcare. Under the scheme, parents and guardians pay money into a digital wallet that the state tops up \u2013 so for every \u00a380 paid in, \u00a320 is added. They can then use that to pay for childcare.\n\nUnfortunately, the system is seriously underused by parents, with just one in 14 eligible parents making use of it. The Office for Budget Responsibility had forecast spending \u00a3800m on tax-free childcare in 2017-18, but that was revised down to \u00a337m specifically because of low take-up.\n\nBut that could be worth a substantial amount to parents this summer and, while the system has had its criticisms, it\u2019s not that hard to use. Apply now and get the tax office to help with your summer care costs.\n\nBook now. Not tomorrow, now\n\nIf you book your holiday clubs nice and early then you may be able to qualify for special discounts.\n\nMost importantly, you will have your pick of the best value clubs \u2013 which you won\u2019t if you leave it until the last minute.\n\nSpread your 30 funded hours\n\nAll parents of three and four-year-olds qualify for 15 funded hours of childcare a week and parents who work at least 16 hours a week qualify for 30 funded hours.\n\nIf you are a parent who qualifies for 30 funded hours of pre-school childcare a week then that can make a big difference to your bills. But it\u2019s no help in the school holidays as it only covers term-time childcare.\n\nThe good news is that you actually qualify for those hours over a year, which means 570 hours of funded childcare for everyone and 1,140 for those who work 16 hours a week or more. Talk to your childcare setting about whether that could be spread out across the year for you, evening out your childcare costs.\n\nShop around for cheaper childcare\n\nObviously, no one wants to leave their children in poor quality childcare but there are a lot of different clubs and deals, meaning it\u2019s worth shopping around.\n\nFor example, this summer Sainsbury\u2019s is offering daily childcare for just \u00a37.50 each, including lunch \u2013 and you can pay with Nectar points. Frustratingly, you can\u2019t pay with childcare vouchers or tax-free childcare for that one.\n\nMany holiday schemes offer a discount if you buy a full week or set amount of days so spend some time finding out what\u2019s available in your area. If they discount a week-long booking but you need scattered days, then ask if they will give you the discount if you book five days at a time.\n\nAsk to work flexibly\n\nYou have a legal right to request flexible working and to have that request given serious consideration by your employer.\n\nThat can make it easier to work around the cheaper clubs that finish earlier or it could even mean asking to work term-time only if that is more affordable.\n\nParents of older children could always ask about working from home, allowing them to do their job but also keep a watchful eye on the kids.\n\nAsk for help\n\nIt seems like every week there\u2019s another news report about how much of a contribution grandparents make to working parents by providing free childcare.\n\nBut if you don\u2019t have grandparents available or willing to help then that can just seem like a kick in the teeth.\n\nOne solution could be to build your own support network. Could you and some friends swap childcare over the summer, providing the kids with company and the parents with cost-free childcare?\n\nIt\u2019s worth asking around because many, many people will be in the same boat.", "description": "It\u2019s\u00a0July, which means parents across the UK are sucking in a deep breath and organising their summer childcare.
