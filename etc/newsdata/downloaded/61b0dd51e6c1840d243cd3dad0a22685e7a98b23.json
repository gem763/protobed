REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo\n\nEven after announcing a preliminary deal with Abe on Aug. 25, Trump left open the possibility of slapping higher duties on Japanese vehicles, a mainstay of the world\u2019s third-biggest economy and by far Japan\u2019s biggest export to the United States.\n\nTrump and Abe are seeking a final agreement in time for their expected meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly later this month.\n\nBut negotiators have only just begun working out details, such as how much tariffs will be cut for which items, Japanese government officials familiar with the negotiations told Reuters.\n\nA deal this month could be tricky, as there\u2019s little time to nail down the wording for politically sensitive areas such as farm products and autos, and clear any legal hurdles, the officials say.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really no deal between the two countries yet,\u201d one official said. \u201cNegotiations have only just begun.\u201d\n\nTrump and Abe announced their agreement on the core principles of the deal, with Tokyo promising to cut tariffs on U.S. agricultural products and Washington doing likewise on select industrial goods from Japan.\n\nJapan managed to keep tariff cuts on U.S. beef and pork imports within levels granted to signatories of the multilateral Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal - meeting a pledge Abe had made to domestic producers.\n\nTokyo also skirted pressure, at least for now, to agree to avoid currency \u201cdevaluations\u201d - a demand of U.S. lawmakers that would have tied Japan\u2019s ability to intervene in currency markets should the yen spike and threaten the country\u2019s export-reliant economy.\n\nAnd it only took a commitment from Abe to front-load already planned purchases of U.S. corn imports to allow Trump to claim victory in announcing the preliminary deal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very big transaction,\u201d Trump said, alongside Abe on the sidelines of a summit in France of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations. \u201cIt\u2019s billions and billions of dollars. Tremendous for the farmers.\u201d\n\nJapanese officials say the country\u2019s total feed corn imports won\u2019t increase as a result of the deal, which simply front loads three months\u2019 worth of roughly 2.75 million tons of imports.\n\nAs private companies have the final say in how much feed corn they import, the government will only facilitate purchases by subsidising storage fees, they say.\n\nJapan imports roughly 11 million tons of feed corn per year, of which 95% come from the United States, data by the Finance Ministry show. That is worth about 254 billion yen ($2.4 billion), suggesting three months of front-loading would have a negligible impact on Japan\u2019s 6.5 trillion yen ($60.4 billion) trade surplus with the United States.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fake, but it\u2019s not a fundamental solution\u201d to address the huge U.S. trade deficit with Japan, said one of the officials familiar with the negotiations. \u201cThe whole point is to make Trump happy.\u201d\n\nSome Japanese officials said they were uncertain whether such sweeteners would have a lasting effect on Trump, who has made it a priority to fix the huge U.S. trade deficit with other countries.\n\nAmong steps he has taken is a threat to slap higher tariffs on vehicles and parts imported from Japan under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, on national security grounds. About two-thirds of Japan\u2019s trade surplus with the United States is made up by autos.\n\nFor Japan, the whole point of signing a two-way trade deal with the United States is to avoid the higher tariffs. After several rounds of negotiations, Washington promised Tokyo it will not impose the tariffs while trade talks continue.\n\nTrump said last month he will not \u201cimmediately\u201d impose the higher auto tariffs, but wouldn\u2019t confirm the decision was permanent.\n\nJapan\u2019s Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi has said the issue will be dealt with \u201cin the final stages of negotiations,\u201d suggesting that talks on the auto tariffs would continue.\n\nJapanese policymakers and lawmakers involved in the negotiations concede that they have little idea how to get assurance from Trump that he will drop his threat of higher auto tariffs.\n\nAnother concern they have is the possibility, albeit slim, that Washington could set import curbs on Japanese automobiles, which would devastate the country\u2019s export-reliant economy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for negotiators,\u201d a second official said. \u201cTrump could change his mind any time.\u201d", "description": "Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may have averted giving away too much in trade talks with U.S. President Donald Trump but Tokyo is struggling ahead of a late-month deadline to achieve its primary goal: get the unpredictable president to drop threats of punitive auto tariffs.", "authors": ["Leika Kihara", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428127157&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF89008", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
