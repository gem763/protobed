According to one ranking system (the Gini coefficient \u2013 see below) South Africa is the most unequal country in the world. Scandinavian countries tend to have the lowest levels of inequality. According to the World Bank, Ukraine is the least unequal.\n\nBranko Milanovic, one of the world\u2019s leading experts in inequality, has found that the rise of globalisation has fuelled a boom in inequality in advanced nations. The biggest winners have been the richest 1% of people on the planet.\n\nHow do we measure it?\n\nThe headline measurement of inequality is the Gini coefficient, also known as the Gini index. Named after Corrado Gini, the Italian statistician who developed the method during the early 20th century, the index gives a score from 0 to 100 to measure the distribution of a nation\u2019s income or wealth. A score of 0 would represent total equality while 100 would represent total inequality, where one person has everything.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Gini score has remained in the mid-30s since the early 1990s, after peaking at 35.1 at the turn of the millennium.\n\nIn that respect, the government can argue that inequality is not rising, as it remains roughly around the same level. However, that isn\u2019t to say that inequality is not high. In the early 1960s, the Gini score stood at around 26 and stayed there until the late 1970s.\n\nWhat about other measurements?\n\nSome analysts argue that the Gini index can be misleading, obscuring the true extent of inequality. Robert Joyce, the deputy director at the IFS, said: \u201cThe Gini is masking different things going on, like the fact that the top 1% is still pulling away from everyone else.\u201d\n\nThere are other methods, such as the Palma ratio, which gives the ratio of the income held by the richest 10% of individuals to that of the poorest 40% , and the 90:10 ratio, which looks at the incomes of those 90% up the earnings ladder compared with those only 10% of the way up. They broadly mirror the trend seen in the Gini; rising rapidly since the start of the 1980s, then remaining largely unchanged over the past 10 years.\n\nLooking beyond the headline measurements could tell a different story. Analysis by the IFS has shown the share of income going to the top 1% of richest households has nearly tripled in the past four decades, from 3% in the late 1970s to about 8% today.\n\nAverage chief executive pay in the FTSE 100 in 2017 was 145 times higher than that of the average worker, up from just 47 times in 1998. The lowest earning working households earn little more after inflation than they did in the mid-1990s.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of austerity and weaker economic growth since the financial crisis, academics suggest public perceptions of inequality have increased despite a relatively unchanged Gini score.\n\nEconomists like analogies. One telling the impact of inequality goes like this: when the traffic comes to a standstill on a motorway, people often become irate when the lane next to their own pulls ahead, leaving them trapped. This appears to have increasingly become the feeling for many in society over the past decade as economic growth has raised the living standards of few, rather than many.\n\n\u201cThe trigger for people becoming more aware of inequality was the crisis and the slowdown in real growth,\u201d says Milanovic. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a topic on its own that came up just as people saw Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos being rich. It came as incomes hadn\u2019t risen as they\u2019d been expecting they might be. And then somebody else really at the top was taking all the gains.\u201d\n\nAverage wages in Britain, adjusted for inflation, remain below the level seen before the financial crisis. But big pay rises are starting to return for people paid more than \u00a31m a year.\n\nAre there other types of inequality?\n\nFor the most part when we think about inequality we think about income or wealth. But there are divisions beyond material standards of living, such as in health, education and social mobility, as well as between gender, race, age, geography and social groups.\n\nDeaton says changes to education policy, including the expansion of university access, may have had an impact on inequality.\n\n\u201cYou get an elite who think they did it all on their own and they deserve their position, and the people who didn\u2019t pass exams and feel left behind. First they think the system is rigged which is a reasonable thing to think and then also partway blame themselves,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created this meritocratic aristocracy and people who didn\u2019t make it are pissed off.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, the top 10% of households by income earn 6.8 times more than those on the lowest rung, but the wealthiest 10% have 290 times more in total assets than those at the bottom of the pile.\n\nThe level of wealth in Britain \u2013 including property, cash savings, shares and pensions \u2013 has risen by 15% in the two years to June 2016 to a record \u00a312.8tn. The vast stockpile is unevenly spread: the top 10% of households own almost half, while the poorest fifth\u2019s overall wealth has declined in real terms.\n\nAlmost eight out of 10 British companies pay men more than women, while women are paid a fifth less than men on average. Workers of Pakistani or Bangladeshi heritage have the lowest average pay of any ethnic group, in the latter case earning 20.1% less than white British workers.\n\nIt goes without saying that inequality between regions \u2013 and generations \u2013 has been rising in the UK as well. The proportion of top 1% highest income taxpayers who live in London has grown by a fifth since the early 2000s.\n\nWhat are the consequences of inequality?\n\nWhile some degree of inequality might be inevitable in a market-based system, extreme divisions can have far-reaching consequences. Among the most visible in recent years is the polarisation of politics and the rise of populism in the UK and elsewhere around the developed world.\n\nBrexit in the UK and the election of Donald Trump in the US, as well as growing support for new political movements in Europe from both ends of the political spectrum, have been linked to rising inequality.\n\nTed Howard, co-founder of the Democracy Collaborative, a leftwing research institute, says three people \u2013 Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett \u2013 own more wealth than bottom 160 million people in the US.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just as an economic fairness issue but also a democratic issue. Can you hold together a democratic culture and state when the wealth holding patterns show no democracy at all? It\u2019s a great threat,\u201d he says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Old-school inequality Photograph: Jimmy Sime/Getty Images\n\nBeyond political divisions the rise of inequality could result in negative economic outcomes.\n\nRightwing economists have argued that redistributing income is self-defeating, but the IMF believes societal divisions can destabilise growth and create the conditions for a sudden slowdown. Economies can be stifled when millions of people are held back from contributing to their full potential.\n\nHow do you reverse inequality?\n\nComplete equality might be impossible to achieve. Some economists say an entirely equal society might be undesirable, arguing that a wholly homogenous world would lack diversity and dynamism. However, the most important question to therefore ask is whether inequality has risen too far, how to reverse it and how to prevent extremes from arising.\n\nThe prevailing logic of the past four decades has been that stronger economic growth serves as the greatest antidote to inequality. Increasing the size of the pie means everyone has a bigger slice. Peter Mandelson, the Labour peer, is famously quoted as saying in the 1990s that he was \u201cintensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes\u201d for this reason.\n\nAttitudes towards tackling inequality may depend on your view of work and how it is valued. Does hard work deserve higher pay? Is banking more valuable than nursing? Are financial incentives the best way to draw the best out of people?\n\nThe main weapons for tackling inequality have been the tax and spending tools available to governments. Progressive taxation and welfare transfers are key, but are by no means the only way to combat the division of income and wealth in society.\n\nIn a sign of how fiscal policy can help, the top 20% of earners in the UK earn 12 times as much as the poorest 20% before redistribution through tax and benefits. After adding welfare transfers and deducting taxes, the gap falls to about five times. Boris Johnson has however promised large tax cuts that are likely to alter how this calculation looks in future.\n\nSome economists and politicians have called for a universal basic income (UBI) to provide a safety net to prevent poverty, although such schemes could prove expensive, while others argue that more targeted spending on the most needy would be more effective. There are also calls to improve funding for education and services instead.\n\nThe French economist Thomas Piketty, a world expert on inequality, has called for a global wealth tax, while the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has suggested using higher inheritance taxes to reverse the extreme concentration of wealth.\n\nWealth and inheritance taxes are politically sensitive and are often gamed through loopholes, made harder in an increasingly globalised world where capital can flow across borders and into tax havens. The mention of wealth taxes often leads to warnings that an economy could lose investment from the rich, who say they would flee overseas.\n\nOne alternative as Ed Miliband famously advocated is the idea of predistribution, which aims to make the economy hard-wired to produce less inequality.\n\nGreater spending on health and education can lower the persistence of income inequality across generations, as well as drive up productivity rates, employment and earnings over the long run.\n\nSome economists have suggested greater democratic ownership could prevent inequality from rising, alongside efforts to place more workers on boards and to use positive discrimination campaigns. Labour has called for the creation of shared-ownership funds that would give workers control of up to 10% of companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, giving them a greater say over corporate decision-making and income from company profits through dividends.\n\nThe government has started forcing companies to report their gender pay gaps and mooted the idea of mandatory ethnic pay gap reporting, in the hope that greater awareness of the issues force companies to address them. Some countries go further, forcing companies to publish workers\u2019 pay levels.\n\nFurther reading", "description": "The UK ranks among the most unequal nations in Europe and many people feel they are not sharing in the country\u2019s wealth", "authors": ["Richard Partington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de753ca7a395ecb28a724e4fd27b1d0cc21e3302/0_11_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=34115bac239b6a3776f79af44acfe260", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
