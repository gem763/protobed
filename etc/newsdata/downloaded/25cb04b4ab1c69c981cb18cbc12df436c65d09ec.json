For the appeasing of the spirits. In accordance with the values that underlie our republic and secularism. In a spirit of responsibility, I asked Bruno Retailleau to withdraw the bill on the veil.\u201d\n\nHowever, Retailleau, of the conservative Republicans party dismissed the criticism, saying in a tweet that putting the text \"under the carpet would be the worst thing to do\".\n\nRead more: Suspect in 80s questioned over attack on mosque in Bayonne\n\nThe draft law \"to ensure the religious neutrality of persons participating in the public service of education\" was tabled in July.\n\nSince then, the issue over the wearing of the veil has been back in the spotlight, with the right pressing French president Emmanuel Macron to speak out on secularism.\n\nMacron, while refusing to \"give in to haste\", on Monday urged representatives of the Muslim faith to further \"fight\" Islamism and communitarianism.\n\nIf the bill is adopted at first reading by the Senate, it will have no legal effect until it has been passed in the same terms by the National Assembly, dominated by the presidential majority.\n\nThe text's rapporteur, Max Brisson from the Republicans, says the ban on clothing or signs that \"conspicuously\" show religious affiliation would not apply to parents participating in school holidays, which is not a teaching activity, nor when they come to school to meet teachers.\n\nWhile the centrists are divided, socialists and communists will vote against the text. Critics have warned reigniting the debate strengthens two forces - the National Rally and the Islamists.\n\nFrance has one of the largest Muslim minorities in Europe, estimated at five million or more out of a population of 67 million.\n\nThe place of religion and religious symbols worn in public can be a matter of controversy in the staunchly secular country.\n\nIn 2010, conservative president Nicolas Sarkozy introduced a law that bans the full-face veil in public.", "description": "The issue is being debated in the wake of a shocking attack at a mosque in Bayonne, where two elderly worshippers were injured by gunshots.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/26/80/06/1000x563_cmsv2_37dd072e-4c0c-5868-96fb-09dd7929d04e-4268006.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
