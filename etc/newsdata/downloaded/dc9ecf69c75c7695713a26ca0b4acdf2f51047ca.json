His appointment will now be signed off on by another board meeting and a wider meeting of all member states, both formalities.\n\n\"I will do my job and I think my job is to implement the mandate in a manner which is independent, which is fair, which is neutral,\" Grossi told reporters after the vote when asked about Iran, declining to go into specifics.\n\nDiplomats do not expect a major shift under Grossi in the IAEA's stance on its most high-profile issues, such as policing Iran's deal with major powers, which Iran is breaching step by step in response to crippling U.S. economic sanctions.\n\n\"What I think is important is that I give my member states and the international community the guarantee that I am absolutely independent and impermeable to pressure,\" said Grossi, a veteran of nuclear diplomacy and currently Argentina's ambassador to the IAEA.\n\nThe IAEA board aims to have Grossi take office by Jan. 1. Grossi said that might happen earlier.
