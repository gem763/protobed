(CSE: CGRO) (OTCQX: CGOTF) (\"Citation\" or the \"Company\"), a licensed cannabis cultivator and producer, is pleased to unveil its new premium line of cannabis for both its DIAMANTE and SUPERIOR brands.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiamante is a premium brand of concentrates. The Company is cultivating the idea of \"Soil to Oil\" by leveraging the high quality and TRIPLE ORGANIC CERTIFIED organically cultivated product from the FIORE Flower brand. These extracts and specific flavors cater to the discerning concentrated cannabis connoisseurs.\n\nCannot view this image?

Much of the focus and excitement has been centered on the Diamonds and Live Resin that complements the FIORE TRIPLE CERTIFIED flower brand.\n\nThe Superior Brand will be an economical brand of concentrated cannabis that will come in Sugar Waxes, Batter/Crumble, Shatter and also Vape Pens.\n\nBoth brands are derived from distillate manufactured from the Company's cannabis biomass at its now fully functional production facility located at North Las Vegas APEX Facility to create the 'base' of what goes into the Vape Pens. The difference between the two brands is that Diamante will use added Cannabis Derived Terpenes while Superior will use third party terpenes sourced from other plant materials (such as lemons, lavender, etc.).\n\nRahim Mohamed, President of Citation commented, \"Getting state approval and launching both our Diamante and Superior brands are important milestones for Citation. Our goal has been to bring heightened awareness of both our new Company name and now our brands to the cannabis world and the investment community.\"\n\nCitation was recently publicized in the Cannabis Brightline syndication.
