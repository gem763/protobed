Like me, it\u2019s a little bubbly, a little bitter, and gets along real well with a cheesy casserole. The rounder, more botanical gin compliments the pear brandy, while the tonic reels in the sweetness (use a good tonic for this). To make one for yourself, you will need:\n\n45ml Old Tom gin\n\n15ml pear brandy\n\nTonic\n\nA generous serving of ice\n\nCombine gin and brandy in a highball or wine glass filled with ice, and give everything a little stir. Top with tonic, garnish with a strip of lemon zest if you like, and get ready to talk politics with your drunkest of uncles, or just hang out in the rec room with your other cool (also drunk) cousins.", "description": "Welcome back to 3-Ingredient Happy Hour, the weekly drink column featuring super simple yet delicious libations.
