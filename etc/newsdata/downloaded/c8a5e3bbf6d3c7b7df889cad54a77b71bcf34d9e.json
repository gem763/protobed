She uses these natural elements \u2014 plus taxidermied creatures like butterflies \u2014 to populate the universes you can see in her sculptures and photographs.\n\n\"I'm a photo-based artist, but the majority of what I do is actually collecting, sourcing and building sets,\" she says. \"It's much more sculptural than just a photograph. I make images on glass plate negatives that I make myself. I create other worlds using plants and animals and insects and try to involve the viewer in this alternate universe that I create.\"\n\nWatch the video:\n\nThrough taxidermy and a lot of scavenging, artist Whitney Lewis-Smith is building new natural worlds. Filmmaker: Nicholas Castel 11:06\n\nIn this video made by filmmaker Nicholas Castel, you'll spend time with Lewis-Smith in the studio and in the forest as she puts together all the tiny pieces that make up one of her works. They're tied to her childhood and the feeling she used to have in nature, but they also have an ecological sensibility \u2014 Lewis-Smith hopes that by feeling more tied to the natural world, we become more inclined to protect it.\n\n\"If you want people to be encouraged and feel that it's important to preserve the planet, they have to feel like they have a hand in it.\"\n\nThis video is part of a recent episode of Absolutely Canadian, where you get to meet four artists working with nature in and around Ottawa. And Lewis-Smith is hugely inspired by the fact that she has access to nature \u2014 even if some of it is under threat.\n\n(CBC Arts)\n\nSpeaking about the 17th-century Dutch paintings that have inspired her own work, she notes, \"A painter would have had to travel with an explorer or paint from imagination from stories told by scientists who travelled to other places in the world or brought specimens back on boats for them. So it was such a luxury to own a painting like this or even to be able to paint one. And now, it's all possible to create that in real life.\"\n\n\"I think it speaks so much to our time and how we really don't understand the value of the world and the things that we have. It also talks about how fleeting time it is, because most of what I'm using in my work won't exist in another 50 years because of our poor use of the environment around us. So I pay attention to collecting sustainably, but I am also very interested in photographing things that are on the verge of extinction or are almost there.\"\n\nSee the work of Whitney Lewis-Smith as part of \"Terramatter\" at Ottawa City Hall Art Gallery, October 10-December 3.
