REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nThis year\u2019s slide in borrowing costs has put the bloc\u2019s finances in a far stronger position \u2014 cutting the interest rates it pays, allowing governments to cheaply refinance older debt, and above all leaving them with cash in hand.\n\nThat\u2019s bolstering the case of those who argue the euro zone can and should spend its way out of economic doldrums. With Germany teetering near recession and the European Central Bank\u2019s monetary policy looking maxed out, many now regard government spending as the key to lifting growth and inflation.\n\nAt current yields, euro zone governments will save an average 0.10% of gross domestic product in interest this year, or almost 12 billion euros, Frank Gill, senior director in the sovereigns team at ratings agency S&P Global, estimates.\n\nSavings would rise to 0.25% of GDP in 2020 and 0.80% in 2021, Gill says, noting this was above already expected savings, and the long tenor of euro securities means debt savings increase over time.\n\nThe savings would total around 140 billion euros \u2014 to put that in context, pent-up demand in Germany for public investment amounts to 138 billion euros, state-owned development bank KfW estimates.\n\n\u201cIt is very significant, this is a windfall really,\u201d Gill said. \u201cSince 2013-14, the decline in interest expenditure to GDP, especially in places like Italy and Spain, has given governments some breathing space.\n\n\u201c(Savings will be )much greater for those sovereigns which have seen larger yield compression, namely, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, and the savings snowball over the next two years.\u201d\n\nAccording to Societe Generale, a 10-basis-point drop in bond yields translates into roughly a fall in interest payments of 0.35% of GDP for Italy, 0.27% in Spain, 0.22% in France and 0.16% in Germany.\n\nFrom environment projects in Germany to greater education and welfare spending in Italy and infrastructure improvements across the euro zone, the fall in borrowing costs could finally spell the end of austerity.\n\nTen-year bond yields, the usual reference rate for borrowing costs, have fallen by half to two-thirds this year. With the ECB resuming rate cuts and dropping time constraints on asset purchases, yields have little impetus to rise.\n\n(Graphic: Annual fall in 10-year EZ borrowing costs , here)\n\nUntil now, euro zone monetary stimulus has effectively been counteracted by stringent budgets. ECB President Mario said last week that if fiscal measures had been in place, they would have complemented central bank policy and boosted growth.\n\nGlobally too, there is a perception that central banks are nearing the limits of what they can achieve. Former U.S. Treasury official Lawrence Summers calls it \u201cblack hole monetary economics\u201d, where small rate changes and aggressive stimulus strategies have only limited impact.\n\nJorge Garayo, senior rates strategist at Societe Generale, noted that U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s fiscal spending plans had boosted inflation expectations in 2016.\n\n\u201cThat had a much bigger impact than QE (quantitative easing),\u201d he said. \u201cWith diminishing returns from monetary policy easing, the only thing that could push (Europe\u2019s) inflation expectations sustainably higher is if we go through a credible fiscal stimulus, most likely coordinated in some way.\u201d\n\n(Graphic: The euro zone's debt load, here)\n\nOPPORTUNITY KNOCKS\n\nEuro zone governments have been saving on interest for years as ECB QE drove down yields. The savings amounted to almost 2% of GDP since 2008, Unicredit estimates.\n\nThe question is, will the budget room now being created persuade fiscal hawk Germany to drop its opposition to more saved over 160 billion euros in interest since 2008. This year\u2019s windfall, following a 70-basis-point slide in 10-year yields, may exceed 5 billion euros, Reuters has reported.\n\nStewart Robertson, senior economist at Aviva Investors reckons if Germany\u2019s 10-year bond yields stay around -0.50% and it can raise debt at this level for four to five years, it would save some 15 billion to 20 billion euros annually.\n\nThere are caveats. Lower yields can take years to feed through. Benefits accrue only when yields fall and stay low for some time. Persistently low yields would also signal economic weakness, in turn threatening tax receipts.\n\nITALIAN JOB\n\nItaly, one of the bloc\u2019s most indebted members, probably has most cause to celebrate low yields. Desperate to revive its sluggish economy, it has frequently clashed with EU authorities for overstepping spending limits.\n\nNow, though, the tumble in its 10-year borrowing costs, to 0.9% from 2.6% in early 2019, is defusing concern over its 2020 budget, due to be submitted next month.\n\nAssuming unchanged yields, Rome can save up to 20 billion euros a year in interest payments, or 1% of annual economic output, Pictet Wealth Management strategist Frederik Ducrozet calculates. That assumes interest payments are spread over the years and yields stay low.\n\nThe government hopes to use that budget leeway to avoid an upcoming sales tax increase. Ducrozet noted the Bank of Italy is also profiting from its 400 billion euros of bond holding, most of it bought under ECB QE. That will partly be redistributed to state funds.\n\n\u201cIn plain English, the Treasury is saving money on all fronts, probably over 1% of GDP on an annual basis,\u201d Ducrozet said. \u201cIf the political situation were to improve for whatever reason \u2013 arguably a big IF \u2013 the fiscal picture would improve dramatically.\u201d\n\n(Graphic: Interest costs and Italy govt debt servicing, here)\n\n(Graphic: Spanish debt servicing costs tumble , here)", "description": "Record-low borrowing costs and falling debt payments could give the euro zone a 140 billion-euro windfall by the end of 2021, freeing cash for projects ranging from new roads to climate protection.", "authors": ["Dhara Ranasinghe", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430825828&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0VY", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
