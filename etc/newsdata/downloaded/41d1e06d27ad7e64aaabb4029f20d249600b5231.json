Called Smart Cruise Control, the union allows the cruise control to mimic the driving style of the human owner\n\nHyundai has deemed what it has named machine learning-based Smart Cruise Control (SCC-ML) 'an industry first' and is set to be implemented in future vehicles.\n\n'The new SCC-ML improves upon the intelligence of the previous ADAS technology to dramatically improve the practicality of semi-autonomous features,' said Woongjun Jang, VP at Hyundai Motor Group.\n\n'Hyundai Motor Group will continue the development efforts on innovative AI technologies to lead the industry in the field of autonomous driving.'\n\nThe driving pattern can be categorized into three parts: distance from preceding vehicles, acceleration (how quickly it accelerates) and responsiveness (how quickly it responds to driving conditions).\n\nThe system uses an array of sensors to gather driving information and then sends it off to the centralized computer. The computer then pulls out the personal driving details and then the AI applies what it has learned\n\nIn addition to driving conditions and speeds are considered as well.\n\nThe system uses an array of sensors to gather driving information and then sends it off to the centralized computer.\n\nThe computer then pulls out the personal driving details and then the AI applies what it has learned.\n\nAnd the driving information is constantly being updated to ensure it fits the driver's style and preferences.\n\nIn addition, SCC-ML is programmed specifically to avoid learning unsafe driving patterns, increasing its reliability and safety.\n\nHyundai has also made it known that it is interested in joining the self-driving taxi industry. The South Korean car marker announced a $4 billion partnership with Aptiv last month, which will design Level 4 and Level 5 production-ready self-driving systems\n\nHyundai has also made it known that it is interested in joining the self-driving taxi industry.\n\nThe South Korean car marker announced a $4 billion partnership with Aptiv last month, which will design Level 4 and Level 5 production-ready self-driving systems intended for commercialization by 2022.\n\nThe venture aims to further Hyundai's leadership position in the global autonomous driving ecosystem.\n\nThe goal is to develop Level 4 and Level 5 production-ready self-driving systems intended for commercialization, which the duo said will be made available to robotaxi and fleet operators, as well as other auto makers, by 2022.\n\nBoth companies will own 50 percent of the joint venture, which has a total value of $4 billion.\n\nHyundai, which seems to have poured the most into the partnership, has contributed $1.6 billion in cash and another $4 billion in vehicle engineering services, R&D resources, and access to intellectual property.\n\nHowever, Dublin-headquarterd Aptiv, will provide its own autonomous driving technology, intellectual property and some 700 employees focused on the development of scalable autonomous driving solutions.\n\nThe new partnership echos the firms' shared vision of making mobility safer, greener and more accessible through the development of autonomous technology.\n\n'This partnership further strengthens Aptiv's industry-leading capabilities in the development of advanced driver assistance systems, vehicle connectivity solutions, and Smart Vehicle Architecture,' said Kevin Clark, President and Chief Executive Officer, Aptiv.\n\n'Hyundai Motor Group's cutting-edge engineering and R&D capabilities make them our partner of choice to advance the development of a production-ready autonomous platform.'\n\nWHAT ARE THE SIX LEVELS OF SELF-DRIVING AUTOMATION? Level Zero - The full-time performance by the human driver of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even when enhanced by warning or intervention systems. Level One \u2013 A small amount of control is accomplished by the system such as adaptive braking if a car gets too close. Level Two \u2013 The system can control the speed and direction of the car allowing the driver to take their hands off temporarily, but they have to monitor the road at all times and be ready to take over. Level Three \u2013 The driver does not have to monitor the system at all times in some specific cases like on high ways but must be ready to resume control if the system requests. Level Four \u2013 The system can cope will all situations automatically within defined use but it may not be able to cope will all weather or road conditions. System will rely on high definition mapping. Level Five \u2013 Full automation. System can cope with all weather, traffic and lighting conditions. It can go anywhere, at any time in any conditions.\n\nThe joint venture's Korea operations will serve as a key technology center as well as a base for vehicle modification and a testbed for autonomous driving mobility service platforms.\n\nHyundai Motor Group's strong presence in the local automotive market and the country's world-class 5G infrastructure are anticipated to spur the partnership's development efforts.\n\n'The new joint venture marks the start of a journey with Aptiv toward our common goal of commercializing autonomous driving,' said Euisun Chung, Executive Vice Chairman, Hyundai Motor Group.\n\n'The combined capabilities of Aptiv, a leading global technology company, and our Group, a global OEM, will create invaluable synergy to lead the autonomous driving landscape.'\n\nAptiv has been leading the race of self-driving car software since the 2007 DARPA Challenge and is widely-known for carrying out the first coast-to-coast automated drive in the United States in 2015, as well as being the first to commercially deploy autonomous vehicles globally.\n\nMore than 100 autonomous vehicles around the world boast Aptiv's technology and to date, the firm has provided more than 70,000 paid autonomous rides, servicing more than 2,700 destinations, while maintaining a near perfect average passenger rating of 4.95-out-of-five stars.\n\nHyundai Motor Group's latest investment epitomizes the Korean automotive leader's ongoing efforts towards realizing fully autonomous driving with the highest level of safety. Hyundai first began testing autonomous vehicles on public roads in the U.S. in 2015 with a license from the state of Nevada.\n\nDuring CES in 2017, Hyundai advanced its trials in urban environments, demonstrating self-driving technologies to the public with its autonomous IONIQ model.\n\nAnd in 2018, the South Korean car maker successfully demonstrated Level 4 autonomous driving technology on a highway, as five NEXO fuel cell electric vehicles traveled 190 kilometers from Seoul to Pyeonchang without the help of a human driver.", "description": "Hyundai is using machine learning to teach its cruise control system your driving style.
