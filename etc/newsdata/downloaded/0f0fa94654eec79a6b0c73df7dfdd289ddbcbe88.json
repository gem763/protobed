We are working closely with [South African Airways Technical] to rectify the findings and getting our flights back on schedule as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s cash-strapped national airline SAA also had to operate an amended flight schedule. Some of the flights operated later than usual and four flights were cancelled, but the airline had combined flights and deployed bigger aircraft to accommodate affected passengers, it said.\n\nMeanwhile, the airlines\u2019 social media teams were hard at work trying to reassure customers that other flights would not be affected.\n\n\u201cKindly note that we are not aware of any disruptions of flights for the rest of the week, should there be any changes, posts will be on the social media platforms,\u201d Kulula tweeted.\n\nBut some passengers were less forgiving.\n\nStuartG tweeted: \u201cUmm, you\u2019ve had all night to do something about it, but your passengers received the announcement 10 minutes before boarding, and the planes are getting pushed back now. So we have a surprise indefinite delay, gosh thanks.\u201d\n\nKulula said that its teams had worked throughout the night to get through the corrective actions and to activate mitigation plans.\n\n\n\nComair, meanwhile, said that it was in the process of transitioning its fleet from South African Airways Technical to Lufthansa Technik Maintenance International.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll the aircraft that have recently joined our fleet are also already maintained by Lufthansa Technik Maintenance International,\u201d tweeted Kulula in response to a question on Twitter.\n\nOne Mango follower on Facebook asked why the airlines \u201cwaited for audits to find faults\u201d.\n\n\u201cDo you not check your aircrafts on a regular basis. This is highly irresponsible and definitely not putting your passengers safety first,\u201d asked Marshall Naidu.\n\n\n\nMango Airlines was quick to assure Naidu that safety was its priority and its aircrafts were checked daily.\n\nAnother customer, Yolanda Grobler, replied: \u201cMango, it\u2019s fine. I will rather wait a bit for a safe aircraft than rushing things and have people complaining about that. At least we can see the safety of passengers are you first concern, thank you. We will fly again in December.\u201d", "description": "Local airlines scrambled to accommodate and pacify angry passengers on Tuesday after flights were affected by irregularities involving maintenance supplier South African Airways Technical.", "authors": ["Staff Reporter"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6750/14d70cf5614446eca6619439d8b593b5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
