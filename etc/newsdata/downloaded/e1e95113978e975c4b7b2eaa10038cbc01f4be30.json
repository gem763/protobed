(Image: Columbia Pictures)\n\nShe\u2019s an impossibly strong pirate heir with a bag of gold and no desire to take crap from anyone. Pippi Longstocking, the red-haired heroine created by classic children\u2019s author Astrid Lindgren, is getting a new film from the folks behind one of the best children\u2019s book adaptations of our time: Paddington.\n\nIn a press release, Studiocanal and Heyday Films announced they were teaming up with the Astrid Lindgren Company to develop a film adaptation of Pippi Longstocking, based on the children\u2019s series that ran from 1945 to 1948. The stories have been translated into dozens of languages, and Pippi\u2019s adventures have been adapted into several shows and films. Hayao Miyazaki even tried to make an anime version, but couldn\u2019t secure the rights.\n\nTaking inspiration from a series of stories she told her daughter, Lindgren created a strong and independent role model for young folks \u2014 the fun-loving daughter of a pirate king who lived on her own and regaled her neighbours with tales of her amazing adventures. The stories contained their share of scary and mature subject material, and Lindgren wasn\u2019t afraid to challenge the audience. Pippi is considered to be a 20th-century feminist icon, a young girl who forged her own path... and also had super-strength. She could lift a horse with one arm!\n\nThat said, Pippi Longstocking does have its share of problems. The original stories have faced criticism over the years for their use of colonial racist stereotypes and other outdated racist language, something that has been addressed more recently.\n\nIn 2014, the Swedish national broadcaster edited two scenes from the 1960s Pippi Longstocking show that were deemed offensive, with the approval of Lindgren\u2019s heirs. It stands to reason that the new film would likewise avoid including those moments.\n\nNo expected production schedule or release date has been announced but we\u2019ll bring you more as we know it.", "description": "She\u2019s an impossibly strong pirate heir with a bag of gold and no desire to take crap from anyone.
