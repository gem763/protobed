REUTERS/Tiksa Negeri\n\nAt least 400 young men joined the protest at the house of Jawar Mohammed in the capital Addis Ababa while around two dozen police officers stood nearby, a Reuters witness said.\n\nThe young men, from the Oromo ethnic group, chanted their support for Jawar and against Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, the winner of this year\u2019s Nobel peace prize.\n\nPolice surrounded Jawar\u2019s house late on Tuesday night and ordered his bodyguards to leave, Jawar told Reuters.\n\nJawar said he did not know who had ordered the deployment of police and the removal of his guards, but said he believed that \u201cwhoever was orchestrating this was planning an assassination\u201d.\n\nPolice denied they had ordered officers to the house, but Abiy had earlier warned unnamed media owners against stirring up unrest.\n\n\u201cThose media owners who don\u2019t have Ethiopian passports are playing both ways,\u201d he told parliament on Tuesday. \u201cWhen there is peace you are playing here, and when we are in trouble you not here.\n\n\u201cWe tried to be patient. But if this is going to undermine the peace and existence of Ethiopia ... we will take measures. You can\u2019t play both ways.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Abiy\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u2018ABIY DOWN!\u2019\n\nJawar, who was born in Ethiopia but holds a U.S. passport, founded the Oromia Media Network, an independent television channel and news website.\n\nHe has 1.75 million Facebook followers. From 2016 to 2018, he used social media to organise strikes and protests across the Oromiya region that piled pressure on the government and led to the resignation of Abiy\u2019s predecessor in February 2018.\n\nJawar and the prime minister are both Oromo, Ethiopia\u2019s largest ethnic group. Many young Oromo men consider Jawar a hero who brought the political change they fought for.\n\nJawar, who promotes non-violent activism and an \u201cOromo first\u201d ideology, returned to Ethiopia from the United States last year after Abiy come to power.\n\nThe young men outside Jawar\u2019s house call themselves \u201cQeerroo\u201d, an Oromo term meaning \u201cbachelor\u201d adopted by politically active young men.\n\nSome shouted \u201cJawar, Jawar\u201d and \u201cAbiy Down! Abiy Down!\u201d\n\nOne Jawar supporter, 27-year-old student Terefe Waltaji, said he had seen Jawar\u2019s post on Facebook reporting that his house was surrounded.\n\n\u201cI called three of my friends and came running,\u201d Terefe told Reuters. \u201cI am angry at the government ... Abiy is letting down the Oromo people and Qeerros who brought him to this stage. If Jawar is in trouble all of us Oromos are in trouble.\u201d\n\nAbiy, who won the Nobel prize this month for his peacemaking efforts with longtime enemy Eritrea, came to power in April 2018 and began introducing political and economic reforms.\n\nThose reforms have opened up what was once one of Africa\u2019s most repressive nations, but also stoked violence along ethnic lines.", "description": "Hundreds of supporters of an Ethiopian ethnic activist and media entrepreneur gathered outside his house on Wednesday, hours after it was surrounded by police following a warning by the prime minister against media owners \"fomenting unrest\".", "authors": ["Tiksa Nigeri", "Giulia Paravicini", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444121226&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M18H-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
