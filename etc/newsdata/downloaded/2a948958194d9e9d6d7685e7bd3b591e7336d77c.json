We use the word \u201chero\u201d so often that its meaning is dulled, but these three are the real thing.\n\nAD\n\nThe first nominee was Mirza Dinnayi , a Yazidi activist from Sinjar, Iraq. He has been rescuing fellow members of his persecuted minority and evacuating them to Germany since al-Qaeda began attacking the Yazidis in 2007. When the Islamic State began all-out genocide against the Yazidis in 2014, Dinnayi repeatedly risked his life on rescue missions.\n\nAD\n\nIn late 2014, a helicopter he was on crashed. Dinnayi was badly injured, but he soon went back to the struggle. He explained his motivation to the Aurora selection committee: \u201cWherever the victims are, if you know about them and you say, \u2018I don\u2019t care,\u2019 you will forever feel guilty.\u201d\n\nA second nominee was Zannah Bukar Mustapha , a lawyer and schoolteacher from Maiduguri, Nigeria. He founded a modern school there that enraged the Boko Haram militants, who abducted at least 276 female students from the nearby town of Chibok. At great personal risk, Mustapha went to a secret meeting with Boko Haram representatives in October 2016 and persuaded them to release 21 of the girls. Thirteen months later, he helped gain the release of another 82.\n\nAD\n\nMustapha expressed the philosophy of tolerance that guides his school, even amid terror and rage: \u201cEverybody is part of it. Nobody thinks, I\u2019m on my own, I\u2019m not part of this. . . . This is a school where every child matters.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA third nominee was Huda al-Sarari , a lawyer from Aden, Yemen. As civil war ravaged her country, she investigated a network of secret prisons where Yemenis had been tortured. After her reports helped free some of the prisoners, her car windows were smashed and she was personally threatened, but she didn\u2019t stop. She told the Aurora committee that her goal was to establish the rule of law in Yemen, so that even al-Qaeda suspects could be detained and interrogated legally.\n\nI heard these gripping personal stories while serving as master of ceremonies for the awards presentation. I\u2019ve performed this role since the awards began in 2016, as a way of supporting Aurora and the vision of its founders, Vartan Gregorian , the head of the Carnegie Corporation of New York; Noubar B. Afeyan , founder of a life-science company called Flagship Pioneering in Boston; and Ruben Vardanyan , a brilliant Russian Armenian businessman and philanthropist who had the original vision for Aurora.\n\nAD\n\nOne reason the Aurora idea of \u201cgratitude in action\u201d appealed to me is that my father\u2019s family is Armenian, and some of my relatives perished in the 1915 genocide. I liked the idea that Aurora would look outward to the world rather than inward, praising modern-day activists who save lives today in the way that Armenians were saved during their persecution.\n\nAD\n\nI don\u2019t know how the judges made their decision among these three remarkable finalists. The selection panel included Nobel Peace Prize laureates Oscar Arias from Costa Rica, Shirin Ebadi from Iran and Leymah Gbowee from Liberia, and it was chaired by Lord Ara Darzi, a prominent British physician and humanitarian.\n\nBefore a thousand people gathered in Freedom Square here on Saturday night, Aurora announced the selection of Dinnayi, the Yazidi activist. This was partly a recognition by Aurora that genocide continues in our world, even after the Nazi Holocaust against the Jews and the vow \u201cNever again.\u201d The previous three winners had also saved lives amid genocides \u2014 in Rwanda, Sudan and Myanmar.\n\nAD\n\nOn a clear day in Yerevan, you can see the peak of Mount Ararat, where legend has it that Noah\u2019s ark came to rest after the flood, and mankind had a second chance to repair the world. We all have small versions of that second chance every day to affirm our common humanity against hatred and injustice. Gratitude in action is a good slogan for a world that\u2019s far too burdened with rage and intolerance.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The remarkable finalists at the awards ceremony of the Aurora Prize for Awakening Humanity makes one wonder how the judges made their decision.", "authors": ["David Ignatius", "Columnist Covering Foreign Affairs"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/O5Jkg37TvMw_lEgb-cGiDh3MOR8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LP7QEHHVCQI6TIUFRAVI4ODKSY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
