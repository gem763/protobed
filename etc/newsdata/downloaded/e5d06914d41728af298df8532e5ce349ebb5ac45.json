Gonna get Clara to do support for me at my SSE shows.\n\n\"Just her reacting to videos of stuff.\"\n\nHe then replied to Ruffalo: \"Wow! That\u2019s both you and Lou Ferrigno have been told off by Clara now\n\n\"Can\u2019t wait till she\u2019s old enough to understand how big a deal she was. Thanks.\"\n\nAnd, just like Ruffalo, the rest of twitter thought it was brilliant.\n\nOne social media user said: \"She\u2019s legit mad!! HAHAHAHAHAHA\"\n\nBefore another replies: \"But then just goes back to eating her chips. I see her priorities are in order.\"\n\nThe original video has been retweeted 36,500 times and has 278,400 likes.\n\nBut the like from Hollywood's meanest and greenest actor sets a pretty high banner.", "description": "Little Clara Rafferty, 2, couldn't believe her eyes when the famed Marvel superhero went green before her eyes", "authors": ["Sheena Mcstravick", "Image", "Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20568924.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-12-at-225512.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
