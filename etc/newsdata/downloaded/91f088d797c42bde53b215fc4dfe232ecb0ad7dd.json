I told him, 'I won't sue you,'' she recalls saying.\n\nInstead, the mother faults her obstetrician. 'I held responsible the OB who didn't listen to me, who continued to cut me through my screams,' she said.\n\nSomerstein said that she had never expected the birth of her child could result in such excruciating pain, but that C-sections were more common than she had realized.\n\nA mother has described her harrowing experience having a C-section without anesthesia, which left her unable to initially bond with her child after birth (file image)\n\n'I hadn't read the chapter in 'What to Expect When You're Expecting' about C-sections. Though they constitute more than 30% of births in the US,' Somerstein wrote.\n\nSomerstein says she never filed a lawsuit because she had difficulty finding legal representation. Lawyers said they couldn't take her case.\n\n'One mused, 'How long was it? Five minutes?' asking about the C-section's duration. 'You're healthy, your daughter's healthy. What are you so upset about?' She gave up looking for an attorney right before the statute of limitations for obstetric-related malpractice cases had run out, which in New York state is 2 1/2 years.\n\nShe recalled the first 'red flag' of her ordeal came when her anesthesiologist 'had to re-up my epidural three times.'\n\nAfter the epidural finally worked, Somerstein said her labor went on for hours. Then, after her doula and midwife went to dinner and returned, her water broke. But her labor would continue past midnight, lasting 24 hours.\n\n'I think it's time to call it, to do a C-section,' she recalled her midwife suggesting.\n\nEven though she was pushing, Somerstein said her baby's heart rate wasn't returning to levels that seemed safe, and that she and the child were exhausted.\n\n'I must have known something was going to go wrong, because I asked if I was going to die, if my baby was going to die. 'Oh, no, the midwife said, you're going to be fine,'' Somerstein says.\n\nHer obstetrician in his surgical notes would later describe the pain Somerstein endured.\n\nHe wrote that 'the patient was a having great deal of difficulty, tolerating pain, was indicating that she was having a great deal of difficulty coping with the pain and was screaming from the pain.'\n\nAfter enduring the painful child birth, Somerstein said she found that she couldn't look at her daughter. 'I was in too much pain. 'I don't want to see her,' I said. 'No, no, no, I don't want to see her. I can't see her. Take her away!' (file image)\n\nWhen the doula brought her the child to nurse, Somerstein says she found that she couldn't look at her.\n\n'I was in too much pain. 'I don't want to see her,' I said. 'No, no, no, I don't want to see her. I can't see her. Take her away!'\n\nSomerstein dreads her daughter might read how she reacted, once she's older. 'Can you imagine if she reads this? If she learns that at her most vulnerable, her first hours on the planet, I sent her away?'\n\nShe also recalls that at first, she couldn't name the child. Once a name came to her, which she doesn't reveal, but explains that it means 'free person,' she said she found she still could use it.\n\n'I couldn't use the baby's name to address her. For weeks she remained 'the baby,'' she says.\n\nThe mom said she also had difficulty getting close to her daughter.\n\n'I had trouble bonding with the baby. My skin felt as if it had electricity inside and I didn't want to touch her, or anyone. I did not want to see anyone either,' she writes.\n\nSomerstein said she had wondered for a while if her daughter, now almost 4, recalled the pain of her birth, her 'rejection of her, our lonely early months.'\n\n'The possibility is more painful now that we know each other \u2014 now that my heart is larger, has opened to accommodate my love for her,' she added.\n\nShe said she fears being seen as a 'damaged person,' but that it's her job to shield her daughter from such feelings, 'to change the narrative from the way it began.'\n\n'I have this chance all the time; it's part of the regular stuff of parenting,' she says. 'Like when she wakes up in the middle of the night, and uses words to say what she could only express through cries as an infant: 'Momma! Momma! I need you! Come get me!'\n\n'My heart cracks. She's scared. She needs me,' Somerstein says. 'The miracle is, she can tell me so. The other miracle: I can hear her. So I go to her. And lift her up.'", "description": "Rachel Somerstein, a journalist and professor living in New York state, has written about her horrific experience having a C-section after a blunder by her anesthesiologist left her screaming in agony.", "authors": ["Ralph R.
