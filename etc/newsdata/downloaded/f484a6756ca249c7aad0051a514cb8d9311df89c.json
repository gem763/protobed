The 22-year-old played in Week 4 against the New York Giants.\n\nWashington\u2019s coaches have said Haskins is not ready for the full-time job as he still has to get used to NFL defenses. But he\u2019ll now get his chance to prove otherwise, if Keenum can\u2019t return.\n\nThe Redskins trail 13-6.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
