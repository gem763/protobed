Although I still don't believe enough Republican senators will have the guts to do the right thing and protect the security of our country, I believe the president\u2019s conduct in asking for \u201ca favor\u201d \u2014 that is, for Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden Joe BidenDemocrats request testimony from Trump's former Russia adviser Pence open to releasing transcripts of call with Ukraine Trey Gowdy joins Trump's legal team MORE and his son\u2019s conduct in Ukraine \u2014 was such an egregious abuse of power that, even if there is a political downside to impeachment, the U.S. Constitution obligates Congress to move forward with it.\n\nOne thing should be clear: When President Trump asked the Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden and his son, he violated a federal law that says it is a crime for a foreign nation to do anything to help a federal candidate; the president would be guilty of solicitation to commit such a crime. What people should understand is that criminal offense does not require a quid pro quo. Notwithstanding it not being required, the president\u2019s words \u2014 \u201cI would like you to do me a favor, though\u201d \u2014 and the subsequent email exchange between former Special Representative to Ukraine Kurt Volker Kurt VolkerDemocrats request testimony from Trump's former Russia adviser Democrats plow ahead as Trump seeks to hobble impeachment effort Graham threatens to call Volker to testify if Democrats don't release testimony MORE, Ambassador to Europe Gordon Sondland and Acting Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor make it obvious that there was to be a definite quid pro quo.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAlthough political realities would dictate that this process be completed as quickly as possible, things are unfolding so fast that some degree of patience should be applied to see how many impeachable offenses may be outlined in the charges.\n\nA few days after the November 2018 election, I wrote in a column for The Hill that said it was OK for House Democrats to investigate some of the abuses of this president, but that it was equally important for the House to continue to legislate and not just investigate. Under the leadership of Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiDemocrats request testimony from Trump's former Russia adviser Trey Gowdy joins Trump's legal team Tillis says impeachment is 'a waste of resources' MORE (D-Calif.), Democrats have done a fairly good job of this, passing bills that would:\n\nWe continue to legislate while we investigate and, in the next few months, pass bills putting some real teeth in gun control, setting forth a national infrastructure revitalization plan and legalizing the Dreamers, to name just a few. But in the face of President Trump\u2019s campaign ad onslaught, it is important for House Democrats or the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to spend money now to let the public know the important legislation that they have passed and sent to the Senate \u2014 which Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellDemocrats plow ahead as Trump seeks to hobble impeachment effort Congress set for showdown with Trump over Kurds Senate Intelligence report triggers new calls for action on election security MORE (R-Ky.) and President Trump have vowed to not even bring to a vote.\n\nIt\u2019s doubtful that one in 10 Americans could name one bill the Democratic-controlled House has passed and sent to the Senate. If we are to make the country understand that we have been legislating as well as investigating, we need to spend money now \u2014 before we get into the heavy political months that lie ahead. This is vitally important because, although the view in Washington may be that impeachment is the only thing on the voters\u2019 minds, it isn\u2019t. Most voters have an opinion about impeachment, but they are more concerned about issues that involve them personally.\n\nDemocrats vowed that we would \u201clegislate and not just investigate.\u201d We have made good on that promise and now we have to tell the American people what we have done. If we do so convincingly, 2020 could indeed be a very good year.\n\nEdward G. Rendell was the 45th governor of Pennsylvania.
