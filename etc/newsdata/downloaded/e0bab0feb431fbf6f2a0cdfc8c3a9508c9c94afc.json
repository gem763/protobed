Party Hub, which is available in the game\u2019s mobile apps, lets you see which of your friends are online and start audio conversations with them. The feature is based on similar technology developed by Houseparty, the group video chat app that Fortnite maker Epic acquired in June.\n\nFor now, chat is limited to audio, though the company says that text chatting is under development. (Whether it someday adds video chat, which is Houseparty\u2019s core feature, remains an open question.)\n\nYou can talk to friends in the Party Hub even if they\u2019re playing a game and you\u2019re not. Or, if you start a conversation in the mobile app but want to play on a PC or video game console, just open Fortnite on that device while you have the app open and the chat will transfer there.\n\nYou can also prevent people from starting chats with you or joining your party by tapping a lock icon over your avatar. Or you can invite new people to your chat by ringing one of the game\u2019s llama bells on various screens throughout the app.\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re just scratching the surface of what\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nIn a blog post, Epic said that \u201cParty Hub creates new possibilities for syncing up with your squad and staying in touch with friends, and right now we\u2019re just scratching the surface of what\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nWhen Epic acquired Houseparty, it promised to \u201cbuild even more fun, shared experiences\u201d using that app as a foundation. With today\u2019s introduction of the Party Hub, that idea is coming into view.\n\n\u201cGames can be a foundation for socially connected community in a way that is different from some of the other platforms that are out there, that are increasingly too political or controversial,\u201d said Sima Sistani, Epic SF studio director and Houseparty CEO.\n\nFortnite, which is free to play but has been massively successful selling in-game cosmetic items, has effectively become a social network unto itself for a generation of young teenagers. The majority of current players play with friends, the company says. Viewed from that perspective, adding social features like audio chats is only natural.\n\n\u201cWe have this opportunity now, because of the business model,\u201d Sistani said. \u201cIt allows us to really take a stab at building social in a way we aspire it to be \u2014 a more positive, complimentary community.\u201d\n\nParty Hub will be rolling out today in Fortnite\u2019s apps for Android and iOS.", "description": "You can now talk with friends in the Fortnite app whether you\u2019re playing the game or not.
