REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe signs of a deceleration in consumer spending reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday came on the heels of reports this month showing a moderation in job growth and services sector activity in September.\n\nThe economy is being hamstrung by a 15-month trade war between the United States and China, which has soured business sentiment, leading to a decline in capital expenditure and a recession in manufacturing.\n\nRetail sales dropped 0.3% last month as households cut back spending on motor vehicles, building materials, hobbies and online purchases. That was the first drop since February.\n\nData for August was revised up to show retail sales gaining 0.6% instead of 0.4% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would climb 0.3% in September. Compared to September last year, retail sales increased 4.1%.\n\nExcluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales were unchanged last month after advancing by an unrevised 0.3% in August. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.\n\nLast month\u2019s drop and August\u2019s unrevised gain in core retail sales likely suggest a much more significant slowdown in consumer spending in the third quarter than economists had been anticipating after a surge in the prior quarter.\n\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, increased at a 4.6% annualised rate in the second quarter, the most in 1-1/2 years. Signs the economy\u2019s growth engine was sputtering could further stoke financial market fears of a sharper slowdown in economic growth.\n\nU.S. stock index futures extended losses after the release of the data. Yields on U.S. Treasuries were trading lower while the dollar .DXY was largely unchanged against a basket of currencies.\n\nBROAD WEAKNESS\n\nThough President Donald Trump announced a temporary truce in the trade war with China last Friday, which delayed additional tariffs that were due this month, economists say the longest economic expansion on record remained in danger without all import duties being rolled back.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday that the U.S.-China trade war would cut 2019 global growth to its slowest pace since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and expressed caution over Trump\u2019s so-called Phase 1 trade deal, saying more details were needed.\n\nGrowth is also being restricted by the fading stimulus from last year\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut package.\n\nWith consumer spending slowing, a full trade deal still elusive and the likelihood of a disorderly exit from the European Union by Britain, many economists expect the Fed to cut interest rates at its Oct. 29-30 policy meeting to keep the expansion, now in its 11th year, on track.\n\nThe U.S. central bank cut rates in September after reducing borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP increased at a 1.7% annualised rate in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 2.0% pace in the April-June quarter, slowing from the first quarter\u2019s brisk 3.1% rate. The government will publish its snapshot of third-quarter GDP at the end of the month.\n\nAuto sales fell 0.9 percent in September, the most in eight months, after accelerating 1.9% in August. Receipts at service stations fell 0.7%, likely reflecting cheaper gasoline.\n\nSales at electronics and appliance stores were unchanged, getting no boost from the launch of Apple\u2019s (AAPL.O) new iPhone model. Sales at building material stores fell 1.0%. Online and mail-order retail sales dropped 0.3%, the most since December 2018. That followed a 1.2% increase in August. Spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores dipped 0.1%.\n\nBut receipts at clothing stores rebounded 1.3% last month after falling 0.7% in August. Sales at furniture stores increased 0.6%. Sales at restaurants and bars gained 0.2%.", "description": "U.S. retail sales fell for the first time in seven months in September, suggesting that manufacturing-led weakness could be spreading to the broader economy, keeping the door open for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again later this month.", "authors": ["Lucia Mutikani", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441488267&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F172", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
