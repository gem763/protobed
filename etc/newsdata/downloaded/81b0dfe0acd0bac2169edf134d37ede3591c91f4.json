McAleenan, the architect of much of the recent success.\n\nMr. Trump announced that Mr. McAleenan was out Friday evening, capping off a day that saw three different judges rule against the president on immigration.\n\nOne federal court in Texas erected a new hurdle to Mr. Trump\u2019s wall building plans, ruling the border emergency proclamation the president issued in February \u2014 which he\u2019s using to siphon Pentagon money toward the wall \u2014 is illegal.\n\nFederal judges in New York and California also ruled against Mr. Trump\u2019s new policy cracking down on immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally and use public benefit programs such as Medicaid, finding that he not only cut too many procedural corners but was likely breaking immigration law, too.\n\nJudge George B. Daniels, a Clinton appointee on the court in New York, said the policy\u2019s attempt to reward would-be immigrants who spoke English was \u201csimply offensive,\u201d and said the other new tests have \u201cabsolutely no support in the history of U.S. immigration law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rule is simply a new agency policy of exclusion in search of a justification. It is repugnant to the American Dream of the opportunity for prosperity and success through hard work and upward mobility,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe ordered a nationwide halt to the \u201cpublic charge\u201d policy, which was to take effect this week.\n\nAnother judge in California issued a similar, though more limited ruling on the same topic.\n\nThe public charge rule, which Mr. McAleenan and acting Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli had pushed through earlier this year, was supposed to be a marquee move in Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to try to limit the drain some legal immigrants pose on taxpayers.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham called the decisions \u201cinexplicable,\u201d and complained they\u2019re part of an anti-Trump spate of decisions.\n\nAnother came Friday when Judge David Briones, a Clinton appointee to the bench in western Texas, ruled that Mr. Trump\u2019s border emergency declaration \u2014 which he said gave him the power to shift money around within the federal budget \u2014 was illegal.\n\nHe said Congress took clear steps to try to limit how much border wall Mr. Trump could build in 2019, and the president\u2019s attempt to funnel Pentagon funds toward wall construction disrupts Congress\u2019s power over spending.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s proclamation is unlawful,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t issue an immediate injunction, saying he wants to hear more briefing about how to craft such an order.\n\nThe adverse rulings were all the more striking because Mr. Trump had been notching wins on immigration, and had made headway on cutting into the record levels of migrant families who had been surging across the border earlier this year.\n\nKey to cutting the numbers was a Trump policy that sent tens of thousands of would-be asylum-seekers back to wait in Mexico while their cases are heard in the U.S.\n\nKnown official as the Migration Protection Protocols, and unofficially as the \u201cRemain-in-Mexico\u201d policy, it undercut migrants who\u2019d planned to make bogus asylum claims and were counting on a years-long backlog of cases to given them a chance to gain a foothold in the U.S. while they waited for their hearings.\n\nThat policy was spearheaded by Mr. McAleenan.\n\nSo were a series of agreements with Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, the three countries mostly responsible for the migrant surge. Each of them has promised to do more to keep their own people from fleeing \u2014 and to help block others who cross their territory en route to the U.S.\n\nDespite those gains, Mr. McAleenan had a tenuous relationship with some in the White House during his six months in office, and some Trump allies had predicted last month that his time would soon be up.\n\nMr. Trump announced the upcoming departure via tweet Friday night and Mr. McAleenan promised \u201ca smooth transition.\u201d\n\nNeither the president\u2019s tweet nor Mr. McAleenan\u2019s statement suggested he was pushed out, and both were gracious toward each other, though Democrats still suspected Mr. Trump gave a push.\n\nRep. Bennie G. Thompson, Mississippi Democrat and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, called it an \u201couster.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will only add to the chaos for a Department where there are chronically too many leadership vacancies and positions held by unconfirmed, \u2018acting\u2019 officials,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed every top immigration post in the department is held by an acting official now.\n\nThe president promised to announce a replacement this week, and Mr. Cuccinelli is the front-runner, having pushed through a series of big policies \u2014 including the public charge rule \u2014 in his months at the helm.\n\nAnother possibility could be former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who brings more immigration experience to the job.\n\nMr. Kobach and Mr. Cuccinelli were in an unofficial competition earlier this year for an immigration czar post the president was contemplating.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
