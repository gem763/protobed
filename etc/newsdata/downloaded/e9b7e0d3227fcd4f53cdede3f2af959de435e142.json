The Swiss star is now 4-4 against Djokovic in Grand Slams despite being just 2-15 against him in all other matches.\n\nIt's the first time since 2006 Djokovic has entered the U.S. Open and failed to reach the semifinals.\n\nThe 32-year-old was seeking his third major title of the season\u2014something he's accomplished twice in his career\u2014but fell short of even reaching the quarters.\n\nWawrinka was on top of his game from the start of this match, keeping up on the scoreboard despite some excellent shots from his opponent:\n\nAs good as Djokovic was, Wawrinka was simply better and made great adjustments throughout the match:\n\nWhile the No. 24 player in the world had been up and down to this point in 2019, there was no denying he was at the top of his game:\n\nWawrinka earned one break and saved three break points in the first set to win 6-4, but he truly showed his resolve in the second set by coming back from a 3-0 deficit. He ended up winning 22 of 29 service points in the set while eventually earning the 7-5 victory.\n\nThree games into the third set, Djokovic couldn't overcome his shoulder pain and chose to retire.\n\nIt's a disappointing end to his Grand Slam season, but he produced yet another great year despite being limited at times by injuries.\n\nMeanwhile, Wawrinka once again showed his ability to step up when it matters most. He hadn't won more than one match in any of his four tournaments since Roland Garros, but he's into the quarterfinals once again and is clearly a threat to go deeper.\n\nWith his domination on first serves Sunday (84 percent) and court coverage, the 34-year-old looked as good as ever.\n\nHe will match up against No. 5 Daniil Medvedev in the next round.", "description": "Novak Djokovic  won't defend his U.S. Open title after retiring in the third set against Stan Wawrinka, who was up 6-4, 7-5, 2-1 in the Round 4 matchup.
