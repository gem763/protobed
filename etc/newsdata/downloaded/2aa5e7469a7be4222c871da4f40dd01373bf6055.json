President DONALD TRUMP said this to French President EMMANUEL MACRON on Thursday night, according to a White House readout distributed by the pool: \u201cPresident Trump reiterated that dropping sanctions against Iran is not going to happen at this time.\u201d\n\nNYT\u2019S NEW LONDON BUREAU CHIEF MARK LANDLER on A9: \u201cTrump and Johnson\u2019s Complex \u2018Bromance\u2019 Is Underscored by Pence Visit\u201d: \u201cBattered by serial defeats in Parliament, scolded by members of his own party, abandoned by even his own brother, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain looked this week like someone who could use a friend.\n\n\u201cHe got one Thursday \u2014 or at least a faithful understudy \u2014 in the person of Vice President Mike Pence. Mr. Pence met Mr. Johnson at 10 Downing Street to pass along President Trump\u2019s support of the prime minister\u2019s plan to pull Britain out of the European Union.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump himself offered Mr. Johnson a long-distance pat on the back Wednesday as Mr. Johnson battled a recalcitrant Parliament, telling reporters, \u2018Boris knows how to win.\u2019\n\n\u201cThese days, however, Mr. Johnson does not look like much of a winner. \u2026 Friendship with Mr. Trump is also a fickle thing. He was friendly with President Emmanuel Macron of France until the two men fell out over Iran and climate change, among other issues. Mr. Johnson, as foreign secretary under Prime Minister Theresa May, unsuccessfully lobbied the White House not to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.\u201d NYT\n\n-- PENCE landed from his European trip at 12:30 a.m. From pooler Bob Costa of WaPo: \u201cOf note: During the flight, a WH official said VPOTUS has rescheduled a major speech on China for this fall, date to be announced, at a think tank in Washington.\u201d NOTE: Pence canceled a China speech a few months ago, as the U.S. was negotiating with the Chinese.\n\n!!! \u2026 THE TELEGRAPH\u2019S @rafsanchez: \u201cI asked Netanyahu if he had confidence in @AviBerkow, the 30-year-old former Kushner [assistant] the White House has put in charge of Israeli-Palestinian peace. \u2018Why not?\u2019 he replied.\u201d\n\nA message from The Boeing Company: \u201cThere\u2019s some familiarity here that makes you comfortable,\u201d says Nicole Canada, one of 20,000+ veterans using military experience and leadership skills to strengthen our team every day.

At least according to him.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s relentless justifications of his erroneous warnings that Hurricane Dorian was threatening Alabama on Sunday, which created days of ridicule and skepticism, are just the latest example of the president\u2019s lifelong reluctance to admit an error, no matter how innocuous.\n\n\u201cHis fervent, dayslong pushback has displayed not only his prolonged focus on a personal spat but his willingness, notably again late on Thursday, to deploy government staff and resources to justify an inaccurate claim. Presidential proclamations can move markets, rattle world capitals and, in this case, unnecessarily alarm the residents of a state. Trump\u2019s relationship with the truth and accountability threatened to, yet again, diminish the weight of any president\u2019s words.\u201d AP\n\n-- NANCY COOK: \u201cThe short arc of a Sharpie captures the long arc of Trump\u201d: \u201cThe tone of the entire Trump presidency was captured this week with the simple swipe of a black Sharpie. An ill-timed, inaccurate but well-intentioned Twitter warning from Presidential Donald Trump at the start of the week extended into a five-day presidential feud by Thursday, transforming a forgettable fact-check of his words into an epic storm of attacks as the president repeatedly doubled down and dug in.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s latest move of promulgating false information, blaming the media for the coverage of it and then subsequently turning that controversy into a seemingly pointless multi-day story reminded current and former White House aides, advisers and Trump allies of all the times in business and government he has leaned on the same playbook of never, ever backing down: whether it was the value of his real estate business or the crowd size at his inauguration or his statements about Chinese tariffs.\u201d\n\nQUOTE DU JOUR: \u201cNo one else writes like that on a map with a black Sharpie\u201d -- anonymous White House official to WaPo\u2019s Toluse Olorunnipa and Josh Dawsey\n\nRNC LEADERSHIP UPDATE \u2026 CHICAGO TRIBUNE: \u201cCubs co-owner Todd Ricketts\u2019 property tax assessment appeal on designer Wilmette home sent to state\u2019s attorney,\u201d by Hal Dardick: \u201cThe Cook County Board of Review has referred to the state\u2019s attorney its investigation of Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts\u2019 property tax appeal on his designer Wilmette home after concluding that Ricketts and his real estate lawyer made \u2018misrepresentations\u2019 that lowered tax bills by tens of thousands of dollars.\n\n\u201cThe tax appeals panel concluded that it \u2018does not have sufficient evidence to establish\u2019 that either Ricketts or attorney James FortCamp \u2018knowingly misled\u2019 officials. But the board also noted it does not have the authority to compel those involved to testify under oath.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office does have such power. The tax board, which took a look at Ricketts\u2019 appeal following a Tribune report, did not specify whether it\u2019s seeking a criminal or civil review. A spokeswoman for Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx declined to say, issuing a statement that said the office was \u2018reviewing the matter at this time to determine the appropriate next steps.\u2019\u201d Chicago Tribune\n\nJOE BIDEN on Thursday night at a New York fundraiser, per the N.Y. Daily News\u2019 Chris Sommerfeldt: \u201cBiden recalled meeting Vladimir Putin while serving as VP. \u2018I don\u2019t think you have a soul and his response was \u201cwell we understand each other,\u201d\u2019 Biden said.\n\n\u201cIn order to ensure that Putin doesn\u2019t interfere in more American elections, Biden said, \u2018we have to get every state in the union to move toward having paper ballots. We need the backup.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- BIDEN AT A SECOND FUNDRAISER at the New York apartment of Andrew Goldman, co-founder of Houston-based natural gas company LNG Wester: \u201c\u2018Folks, I know there\u2019s been a lot of attention paid to you showing up tonight. More than I think you anticipated,\u2019 Biden said. \u2026\n\n\u201cHe added, in an apparent reference to the rest of the Democratic presidential primary field, \u2018I'm the only guy who has ever gotten anything done.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- MARC CAPUTO in Rock Hill, S.C.: \u201cBiden bets it all on the black vote\u201d\n\nGood Friday morning.

Republican parties in South Carolina, Nevada, Arizona and Kansas are expected to finalize the cancellations in meetings this weekend, according to three GOP officials who are familiar with the plans.\n\n\u201cThe moves are the latest illustration of Trump\u2019s takeover of the entire Republican Party apparatus. They underscore the extent to which his allies are determined to snuff out any potential nuisance en route to his re-nomination \u2014 or even to deny Republican critics a platform to embarrass him.\n\n\u201cTrump advisers are quick to point out that parties of an incumbent president seeking reelection have a long history of canceling primaries and note it will save state parties money. But the president\u2019s primary opponents, who have struggled to gain traction, are crying foul, calling it part of a broader effort to rig the contest in Trump\u2019s favor.\u201d POLITICO\n\nTRUCKIN\u2019 ...

WSJ'S MIKE BENDER: \u201c\u2018It\u2019s Kind of Like an Addiction\u2019: On the Road With Trump\u2019s Rally Diehards\u201d: \u201cMr. Trump has hosted more than 550 ticketed campaign events since 2015, at least 70% of which include his trademark rallies, according to Republican officials. These rallies form the core of one of the most steadfast political movements in modern American political history, a dynamic that has reordered the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump\u2019s perpetual tour attracts a coterie of political pilgrims who travel across the country and encamp outside arenas for days at a time for the chance to stand in the front row and, for 90 minutes, cheer the man they say has changed the U.S. and, in many cases, their own lives. Somewhere between 5% to 10% of attendees have been to multiple events, the officials said.\n\n\u201c\u2019You go to the rallies, and he basically tells you that you don\u2019t have to put up with \u201cthe swamp\u201d and those kinds of people,\u2019 said Saundra Kiczenski, a 40-year-old Walmart worker from Michigan who has been to 29 rallies. \u2018Because of him I decided not to pay for Obamacare, not pay the fine.
