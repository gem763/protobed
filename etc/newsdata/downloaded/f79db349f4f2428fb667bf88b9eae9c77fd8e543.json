With the EU expected to sign off on a Brexit extension later this week, markets shook off their early nerves with the DAX hitting its highest levels in over a year.\n\nUS markets, on the other hand, appear to be treading water, held back by some disappointing numbers from big hitters like Caterpillar and Boeing.\n\nWith the Brexit process now on pause until the EU decides what length of the extension to offer the UK attention now turns to today\u2019s ECB rate meeting and President Mario Draghi\u2019s last as President.\n\nThe resilience of European markets has been all the more surprising given that a lot of recent economic data has been anything but resilient. The sclerotic nature of the growth story in Europe is starting to fuel concerns that the weakness in the manufacturing sector could start to seep into the services side of the economy.\n\nAt its last meeting, the European Central Bank moved to try and address this by reinstating its asset purchase program to the tune of \u20ac20bn a month, as well as cutting the deposit rate to -0.5%. The bank also lowered its inflation and growth forecasts. If anything, the ECB under-delivered on market expectations in September, and it soon became apparent why, as a series of dissenting voices followed the decision and press conference.\n\nThese disagreements burst out into plain sight a few weeks later as German ECB board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger suddenly announced that she would be leaving her post at the end of this month, following in the footsteps of previous Bundesbank members who have departed early in the last ten years due to disagreements over monetary policy.\n\nIt is becoming quite clear that there are growing tensions within the governing council over the direction of monetary policy, and with the departure of ECB President Mario Draghi, also at the end of this month, these tensions are only likely to increase when Christine Lagarde takes over on the 1st November.\n\nThese disagreements are expected to intensify if today\u2019s latest flash PMI numbers for October from Germany and France show no signs of improving, ahead of today\u2019s ECB rate meeting, and Mario Draghi\u2019s final press conference as ECB President.\n\nThe manufacturing numbers are expected to remain weak, with Germany expected to remain close to ten-year lows of 41.7, with a 42 reading, while services are only expected to improve modestly from 51.4 to 52. French manufacturing is expected to stagnate at 50, with services expected to improve to 51.6.\n\nThe best judge of how well a CEO has done their job is whether they leave the company in a better position than when they took over. If you applied that same standard to Mario Draghi and his tenure at the European Central Bank, then you would have to say that his tenure has been a success.\n\nIt certainly hasn\u2019t been an easy ride, and there is no question that some rules have been bent quite significantly in the last eight years in order to \u201cpreserve the euro,\u201d and potentially preventing a catastrophic crisis. However, while Draghi can certainly be described as the man who saved the euro, it may be a little premature to perform a victory lap, as he did earlier this month when he made just such a claim.\n\nThis meeting may be Draghi\u2019s swansong, and he certainly leaves the euro in a much more stable position than he found it, but the European economy still remains extremely vulnerable. It could also be argued that the ECB is already at the limits of its mandate, and in the absence of any sort of fiscal reform, a point he will once again make loud and clear to EU leaders, there is little in the way of a bazooka left if another crisis were to strike.\n\nWith interest rates already at record lows and deep in negative territory, all the ECB has done is reveal how fragile and brittle the European banking system is, with some now saying that the medicine is killing the patient and that the bank is making things even worse.\n\nAgainst this backdrop and with divisions already breaking out into the open on the governing council, Christine Lagarde will need more than a sticking plaster to paper over the cracks that Draghi has left behind.\n\nEURUSD \u2013 the current pullback appears to be finding support just above the 1.1100 area. Key resistance remains just below the 1.1200 area and 200-day MA. A break below the 1.1100 area opens up the prospect of a test of trend line support from the lows this month comes in at the 1.1060 area, and below that at 1.0920.\n\nGBPUSD \u2013 the slide back from the 1.3020 area found support at the 1.2840 area yesterday. Only a move below 1.2840 opens the prospect of a move towards the 1.2670 area. While above the 1.2840 level, the prospect of a return to recent highs, as well as the 1.3200 area, is a possibility.\n\nEURGBP \u2013 rallies off the 0.8570 area appear to be finding resistance at the 0.8670 area, though we could well spill up to the 0.8715/20 level on any short squeeze. A break below the 0.8570 level has the potential to open up a move towards the 0.8410 area and the lows this year.\n\nUSDJPY \u2013 the 200-day MA and the 109.20/30 area appears to be capping gains for now. Support comes in at the 107.50 area, as well as the lows this month at 106.50.\n\n\"DISCLAIMER: CMC Markets is an execution-only provider.
