Turkey currently hosts some 3.5 million Syrians, and anti-refugee sentiment is on the rise.\n\nThe agreement text adds that Turkey and Russia will launch \"joint efforts ... to facilitate the return of refugees in a safe and voluntary manner.\"", "description": "Syrian Kurdish fighters will have 150 hours from noon on Wednesday to withdraw from areas near the border.", "authors": ["Zia Weise"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177529144-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
