ET: The day after reports surfaced that Liam Hemsworth is \"open to meeting people,\" he's spotted holding hands with a woman in New York City. TMZ has photos. The pair was also seen eating at the West Village restaurant Sant Ambroeus.\n\nHemsworth is reportedly not resentful of his breakup with wife, Miley Cyrus. \u201cHe wants what\u2019s best for her\u2014even if it\u2019s not him,\u201d a source told Us Weekly.\n\nORIGINAL STORY:\n\nIn the two months since Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth announced they were splitting up after less than a year of marriage\u2014but a decade together\u2014there have been countless stories about who Cyrus is dating. First there was the Kaitlynn Carter relationship, and now she\u2019s calling Cody Simpson her \u201cboyfriend\u201d.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s not a single thing wrong with Cyrus\u2019s living her best romantic life, but on the flip side, Hemsworth has stayed relatively quiet in the press and on social media. In the days following the announcement, he posted a simple statement to Instagram. \u201cHi all. Just a quick note to say that Miley and I have recently separated and I wish her nothing but health and happiness going forward,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is a private matter and I have not made, nor will I be making, any comments to any journalists or media outlets. Any reported quotes attributed to me are false. Peace and Love.\u201d\n\nNow Us Weekly is reporting that Hemsworth is ready to get back into the dating game. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been dating anyone,\u201d their source said. \u201cBut he\u2019s open to meeting people.\u201d (He officially filed for divorce on August 21.)\n\nThe Australian actor appears to be dipping his toe back into the world of social media too. Earlier this week he posted his first Instagram since August 28\u2014and it was more in line with the lighthearted, playful feel of his feed. \u201cStart ya day out with a couple of these. They\u2019re super easy \ud83e\udd19,\u201d he captioned a photo of himself hanging off the side of a dumpster.\n\nHemsworth is also back to work, where he was spotted on the set of Dodge and Miles (an upcoming streaming series) in Hamilton, Ontario, in makeup that looks as though he\u2019d just finished filming an intense fight scene.\n\nOriginally Appeared on Glamour\n\n", "description": "The couple announced their breakup in August.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SDUFhKTMYmYldmkLxYC9YA--~B/aD00MDAxO3c9NjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/glamour_497/f0f6c3177cd805543444458508e46d78", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
