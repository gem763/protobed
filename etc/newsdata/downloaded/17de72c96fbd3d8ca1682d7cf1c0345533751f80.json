But the top-ranked Serb broke Soeda for the fourth time in the final game.\n\n\u201cI think I played a pretty good tennis match,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cI served very well until that game I was serving for the match at 5-3 but then I doubled-faulted and allowed him to break and come back into the match.\u201d\n\nDjokovic, who is 42-8 this season with three titles in four finals, will next face Lucas Pouille in the quarterfinals. Pouille beat Yoshihito Nishioka 6-1, 6-2.\n\nHe said he feels fully recovered from his injury.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played three games in a row, the doubles on Monday then two straight singles matches back-to-back, so everything is fine,\u201d Djokovic said.\n\nAlso, Yasutaka Uchiyama beat Radu Albot 6-7 (2), 6-3, 6-4, Reilly Opelka defeated Gilles Simon 7-6 (4), 7-6 (2), and third-seeded David Goffin rallied to beat Pablo Carreno Busta 1-6, 7-6 (8), 6-0.\n\nGoffin is the lone former champion in the draw. He has made the final in both of his previous appearances, falling to Nick Kyrgios in the 2016 final before defeating Adrian Mannarino for the title in 2017.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Novak Djokovic reached the quarterfinals of the Japan Open on Wednesday by beating Japanese wild-card entry Go Soeda 6-3, 7-5.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jim Armstrong"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/02/japan_open_tennis_71269_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f"}
