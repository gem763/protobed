(Mark Brown/Getty Images)\n\nThe Miami Heat appear to be tightening the ship, and team captain Udonis Haslem is firmly on board.\n\nHaslem, in the wake of Dion Waiters\u2019 one-game suspension on Saturday, said the organization is focused on getting Miami\u2019s young locker room together and back into a championship mentality ahead of its season opener on Wednesday.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cIf everybody can\u2019t get on the same page, then we got to kind of fix that situation,\u201d Haslem said, via the Miami Herald. \u201cThe way we\u2019ve been able to win championships in the past is everybody had the same mindset for the same goal and we all were able to figure it out. Those are the expectations that we have and that\u2019s what we want to stick with.\u201d\n\nWaiters was suspended for the Heat\u2019s season opener for \u201cconduct detrimental to the team\u201d on Saturday after \u201ca number of unacceptable incidents\u201d last week. The organization didn\u2019t elaborate on what Waiters actually did.\n\nHowever, according to the Miami Herald, there was a \u201cdisagreement\u201d between Waiters and coach Eric Spoelstra on the bench during their 144-133 preseason loss to the Houston Rockets on Friday. The 27-year-old had two points and two rebounds in just 10 minutes in the loss.\n\nHaslem, though, isn\u2019t disappointed in Waiters, who is preparing to enter his eighth season in the league and his fourth in South Florida.\n\n\u201cI understand that through an NBA season you\u2019re going to have some ups and downs and you\u2019re going to deal with stuff,\u201d Haslem said, via the Miami Herald. \u201cDion is our brother. We hope to get him back as soon as possible. I love Dion.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWaiters\u2019 suspension marks the latest move for the Heat this preseason. Miami sent veteran James Johnson home from training camp early after the former No. 16 overall draft pick failed to meet the team\u2019s conditioning requirements.\n\nWith a younger locker room for the first time in a while \u2014 the team has seven rookies on its roster, including first-round draft pick Tyler Herro, and multiple others still on their rookie deals \u2014 Haslem said the messages being sent early this fall could be a good thing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just getting to what we have built our name and our foundation on since I\u2019ve been here. Just getting back to that,\u201d Haslem said, via the Miami Herald. \u201cSometimes you just get back to the basics and to the core of who you are and what you are. With these new guys and so many young faces, I think it\u2019s very important that they understand from the jump what we\u2019re about.\u201d\n\nAnd in reality, given the lifestyles NBA players live, new Heat star Jimmy Butler said that staying focused really shouldn\u2019t be that difficult.\n\n\u201cOur lives are really lavish, to tell you the truth,\u201d Butler said, via the Miami Herald. \u201cWe come in here for three hours of practice. Then we have the rest of our day to do what we want. I mean, while you\u2019re here, ain\u2019t no distractions. You come in here and you be the best pro you can be. Keep it professional and compete. Hell, that\u2019s all that Coach [Spoelstra] and Coach Riley, that\u2019s all they want us to do. I think that should be easy for three hours.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Dion Waiters\u2019 suspension can serve as a message for the Heat, and captain Udonis Haslem hopes the younger players on their team are paying attention.", "authors": ["Ryan Young"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wX9T8AU4fweuyMrdFRRP8w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTEuMg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CVxwiayhJ3gFjq0_tT1hOw--~B/aD0yODM0O3c9NDI2MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/79ef43e0-f38e-11e9-8b63-fc648a212ce8", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
