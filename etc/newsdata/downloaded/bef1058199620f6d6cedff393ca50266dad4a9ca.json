The borrowing helped pull economies out of the nasty recession, but left them with high debt burdens that make it harder for policy makers to raise rates. It also makes consumers and businesses more likely to pull back from spending money on new goods if economic conditions weaken. \u201cGlobally, you are at worryingly high levels,\u201d said Sonja Gibbs, managing director for global policy initiatives at the IIF. In the U.K., Canada and Australia, central bankers have backtracked from rate increases in the past two years after consumers got bruised more than expected. U.S. consumers, who have borrowed to pay for college, cars and everyday spending, have been less affected because their debt burdens are much lower relative to their incomes. \u201cThe world is in a delicate equilibrium,\u201d said Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, in a February speech. \u201cThe sustainability of debt burdens depends on interest rates remaining low and global trade remaining open.\u201d\n\nGlobal Debt by Sector\n\nCentral banks new lower rates to keep the debt bubble growing.\n\nDelicate Equilibrium?\n\nThe world is in a delicate equilibrium,\u201d said Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England.\n\nEquilibrium Definition: A state in which opposing forces or influences are balanced.\n\nFamilies Go Deep in Debt to Stay in the Middle Class\n\nHere is an article from last month whose headline I thought to be very peculiar: Families Go Deep in Debt to Stay in the Middle Class.\n\nThe American middle class is falling deeper into debt to maintain a middle-class lifestyle. Cars, college, houses and medical care have become steadily more costly, but incomes have been largely stagnant for two decades, despite a recent uptick. Filling the gap between earning and spending is an explosion of finance into nearly every corner of the consumer economy. Consumer debt, not counting mortgages, has climbed to $4 trillion\u2014higher than it has ever been even after adjusting for inflation. Mortgage debt slid after the financial crisis a decade ago but is rebounding. Student debt totaled about $1.5 trillion last year, exceeding all other forms of consumer debt except mortgages. Auto debt is up nearly 40% adjusting for inflation in the last decade to $1.3 trillion. And the average loan for new cars is up an inflation-adjusted 11% in a decade, to $32,187, according to an analysis of data from credit-reporting firm Experian. Unsecured personal loans are back in vogue, the result of competition between technology-savvy lenders and big banks for borrowers and loan volume.\n\nLate Stage Credit Bubble\n\nAbility to buy things one cannot really afford does not make or keep someone in the \"midddle class\".\n\nThose living beyond their means are not in the class they pretend to be.\n\nThere is no \"equilibrium\" here. Wages are not keeping up with needs and desires.\n\nRather, these reports show a late stage credit bubble the Fed desperately wants to keep inflating.", "description": "The Fed's consumer credit report shows a jump in total .09/10/2019 19:24:39PM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Shedlock", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/255/945bdffd-aead-406c-a2b9-bffb3aeb8959.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
