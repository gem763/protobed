He used this opportunity to attack Hillary Clinton\u2019s strategy in 2016, when she failed to campaign in several northern states the president was able to bag on his way to the White House.\n\n\u201cWith Nancy and Chuck, and all of these people focusing on the witch hunt, because they can\u2019t beat us at the ballot,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to win the presidential \u2014 we have great polls.\u201d\n\nMr Trump spoke after the White House released a redacted document it said detailed his conversation in the summer with Ukraine\u2019s leader, Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr Trump claimed the document showed a \u201cbeautiful\u201d conversation, and his supporters pointed out it contained no direct quid pro quo in the sense of the president offering his Ukrainian counterpart something in exchange for investigating Mr Biden.\n\nHowever, Democrats said the document \u2013 which was a partial memorandum rather than a full transcript \u2013 showed the president had clearly asked Mr Zelensky to help, and suggested he liaise with attorney general William Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, about an anti-corruption probe that would include the current Democratic frontrunner.\n\n\u201cWell, thank you very much and I appreciate that,\u201d Mr Trump is reported to have told Mr Zelensky. \u201cI will tell Rudy and attorney general Barr to call.\u201d\n\nIn the days before the call, Mr Trump had ordered advisors to freeze $400m in military aid for Ukraine, triggering speculation he was holding out the money as leverage. Mr Trump has denied that charge and the aid package was not mentioned in the partial memo released by the White House.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Because, you know what, there was no pressure. And you know there was no pressure.\u201d\n\nWith more than 200 Democrats in the House of Representatives supporting the impeachment investigation, some urged Ms Pelosi to keep the inquiry to Ukraine and not expand into other issues Congress had already been investigating.\n\n\u201cWe need to be disciplined about how we communicate,\u201d said congresswoman Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, a state Mr Trump won in 2016. \u201cThe minute we\u2019re talking about the intricacies of process is the minute that we are losing people.\u201d\n\nAlso on Wednesday, some members of Congress said they had received the whistleblower complaint. Republican senator Richard Burr, chair of the Senate intelligence committee, who received a copy, declined to comment on what the complaint contained.\n\nThe whistleblower had filed the complaint to the intelligence community\u2019s internal watchdog, who deemed the allegations \u201curgent\u201d and \u201ccredible\u201d. However, Joseph Maguire, the acting Director of National Intelligence, did not forward the complaint to Congress, which politicians have called a violation of the law.\n\nMr Maguire is due to give testimony on Capitol Hill on Thursday. He denied a report in the Washington Post claiming he threatened to quit if he was not permitted by the White House to speak openly when he appeared.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role. I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "A weary looking Donald Trump has used the setting of the United Nations to attack his critics during a rambling speech in which he had insisted he had done nothing that merited impeachment.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/26/00/trump-un.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
