American industrial capacity\" said Paul Sparrow, Director of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum.\n\nLAURA INGRAHAM CALLS OUT 'SAVED BY THE BELL' REBOOT\n\nFDR's administration committed federal funding to the construction of the bridge in the midst of the Great Recession. The federal pledge, coupled with a $35 million dollar bond issue made the project a reality.\n\nThe raw steel for the bridge was produced by Pennsylvania's Bethlehem Steel, in five different plants, the largest two of which were located on the east coast, make the logistical obstacles nearly as challenging as the engineering.\n\nOn top of that the actual building of the bridge was dangerous and deadly.\n\n\"On a bad day, it's brutal. The winds in there can gust up to 70-miles an hour... You have these fogs that come in off the ocean, even in the summertime, where you can't see 20 feet in front of you,\" recounted Sparrow.\n\nMen worked hundreds of feet in the air. Safety nets were built to catch workers if they fell, but that was not sufficient to guarantee their safety.\n\n'I HUNG UP AND PHONE AND CRIED' DANA PERINO ON SETBACK THAT LED TO WHITE HOUSE\n\n\"On February 17, 1937, 10 men fell to their death when a piece of scaffolding fell through the safety nets,\" Doocy said.\n\nTowering over the city of San Francisco at 746 feet tall, the Golden Gate Bridge stood as a glimmer of hope coming out of the Great Depression. Today, it stands as a reflection of the American spirit.\n\nTo watch all of American Built: Golden Gate Bridge go to Fox Nation and sign up today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but only available only for Fox Nation subscribers.
