In a statement released by the Anchorage School District, the decision was described as \u201cheavy-handed and unnecessary\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Anchorage School District has concluded that our swimmer was targeted based solely on how a standard, school-issued uniform happened to fit the shape of her body.\n\n\u201cWe cannot tolerate discrimination of any kind, and certainly not based on body shape,\u201d it read.\n\nDewayne Ingram, the Dimond High School coach, spoke of Breckynn and her younger sister, Dreamer\u2019s, commitment to the sport, commending their \u201ccommitment and consistency\u201d over a three year period.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just an inspiration that should be celebrated and applauded, not rebuked,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ingram forwarded his appeal to the District which presented the appeal to the Alaska School Activities Association (ASAA) on behalf of the team.\n\nTheir requests include that Willis\u2019 disqualification be reversed, that all points be returned to the team, that the official be decertified and that the current NFHS suit coverage rule be suspended due to its ambiguity and potential for bias in influencing official\u2019s decisions.\n\nThe Anchorage School District described the young athletes are \u201cphenomenal competitors\u201d, adding that \u201ctheir hard work, determination and grit in the pool should be an inspiration to us all.\n\nAlaska follows national high school standards that call for male swimmers to have their buttocks covered and for girls to have both their buttocks and breasts covered.\n\nLauren Langford, a swim coach for the neighbouring West High School team, told NBC that she had heard people say that the girls had \u201cgot what they deserved\u201d and that \u201cthey got what was coming to them\u201d, comments which have had a negative impact on the athletes.\n\n\u201cIt is my opinion that she [Willis] has been targeted and singled out over the last year,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Independent has contacted Dimond High School for comment.", "description": "A 17-year-old swimmer was disqualified from a race she had already won after a referee ruled that her swimsuit was \u2018immodest\u2019 and revealed too much of her backside.", "authors": ["Joanna Whitehead"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/11/teenage-girl-swimming.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
