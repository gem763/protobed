Fentanyl has contributed to an epidemic of opioid abuse in the U.S. that has claimed thousands of lives, including those of other musicians, like Prince.\n\nThree men have now been formally charged with supplying the drugs that killed rapper Mac Miller in September 2018\n\nRyan Reavis (left) and Cameron James Pettit (right) have both been charged for providing the drugs that caused Miller's death\n\nThe unsealed indictment - which is 12 pages long - alleges that Walter supplied the fentanyl and cocaine that Pettit sold to Miller, while Reavis acted as a middleman\n\nNo photographs of Walter have been published by the press.\n\nOn September 5 2018 - two days before he died - Miller allegedly purchased cocaine, Xanax and 10 blue pills that appeared to be oxycodone from Petit.\n\nIn texts purportedly written by Miller to Petit, the rapper proclaimed his love for oxycodone, or 'percs' for the brand name Percocet.\n\nHowever, the oxycodene pills he is said to have purchased were counterfeit, and actually contained fentanyl - a synthetic opioid 50 times more potent than heroin.\n\nMiller was found dead by his assistant at his Los Angeles home on September 7.\n\nA picture of the drugs given to Miller just days before his death, according to court documents\n\nMiller was found dead by his assistant at his Los Angeles home on September 7 2018\n\nBoth Reavis and Walter have criminal records involving drugs, according to the indictment.\n\nIn another set of text messages included in the indictment, Reavis worried in a text about undercover police buying drugs.\n\n'People have been dying from fake blues left and right,' the message said, 'you better believe law enforcement is using informant informants and undercover to buy them on the street so they can start putting ppl in prison for life for selling fake pills.'\n\nReavis, who was arrested last week in Arizona, does not have an arraignment date set yet.\n\nMeanwhile, Pettit and Walter, are scheduled to be arraigned on the charges on October 10.\n\nTwo days before his death Miller allegedly purchased cocaine, Xanax and 10 blue pills that appeared to be oxycodone. Unbeknownst to him, the pills were laced with fentanyl\n\nMiller's beats and rhymes, with their frank expressions of drug use and depression, made him a beloved and respected figure among fans, including some of the biggest names in hip-hop.\n\nThe Pittsburgh native, whose real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was in a two-year relationship with Ariana Grande that ended earlier in 2018. After his death, the pop star posted a loving video of him on her Instagram page and released a song, 'Thank U Next,' that affectionately mentioned him.\n\nThree months after his death, Miller was posthumously nominated for a 2019 Grammy Award for Best Rap Album for his highly-acclaimed LP, Swimming.", "description": "A grand jury indictment unsealed on Wednesday accuses the men of conspiring and distributing cocaine and oxycodone pills laced with fentanyl that caused Miller's death in September 2018.", "authors": ["Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/00/19230212-0-image-a-11_1570057541108.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
