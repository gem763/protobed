Kamala Harris on Thursday suggested disbarring President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and said she was asking the inspector general of the State Department to investigate whether department officials helped Giuliani engage in official business with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe need to know if the personal lawyer of the president, Giuliani, was using government resources for political gain,\u201d Harris told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Thursday night. \u201cAnd frankly, if there were any members of the State Department who were facilitating Rudy Giuliani\u2019s private conversations on behalf of the president, there should be accountability and consequence for that.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": ""}
