That year, they were earning an average of $35,426. By 2017, that jumped to a mere $35,455.\n\nThese numbers are sad enough on their own, but they particularly pale in inflation-adjusted comparison to other age groups. Adults ages 35 to 44 made nearly $2,900 more in 2017 than their 1974 counterparts did. And those ages 45 to 54 saw an income growth of nearly $5,400 over that same time period.\n\nThe income increase \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 for young adults is especially troubling when pitted against skyrocketing expenses for essentials.\n\nThe report looked at data from the US Federal Housing Agency and found that the median price of home sales has increased by 39% in roughly the same time frame. Meanwhile, national health care costs per person have increased by $9,000 since 1970, and the cost of education has more than doubled since 1971, according to the report.\n\nRead more: 7 ways life is more expensive today for American millennials than previous generations\n\nCost of living and income increases are out of balance\n\nThe findings underscore a 2018 report from Student Loan Hero that found that rent, home prices, and college tuition have all increased faster than incomes in the US.\n\nHousing has become so expensive that millennials are waiting longer than ever to buy homes. A report by SmartAsset found that in some cities, the median home outweighed the median income by so much that it could take nearly a decade to save for a 20% down payment.\n\nAnd the rising cost of college is especially problematic considering that students are now borrowing more than ever. The national total student loan debt is $1.5 trillion, and the average student debt per 2018 graduate who took out student loans is $29,800.\n\nIt's a shock for millennials, who came of age during the Great Recession, to find that the cost of college doesn't necessarily lead to higher earnings. Living costs, student loan payments, and lower earnings make it difficult for them to catch up financially.", "description": "People ages 25 to 34 have seen a $29 income rise in the past 40-plus years, adjusted for inflation.
