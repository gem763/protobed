Two of the ousted lawmakers advocated separatism from mainland China.", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong was barred Tuesday from standing in an upcoming local election, after months of huge and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/b6186a_posters-pro-democracy-activist-joshua-wong-are-in-central-government-complex-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
