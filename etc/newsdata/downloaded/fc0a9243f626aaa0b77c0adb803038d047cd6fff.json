The fixes included changing how the angle-of-attack sensors feed information to the cockpit and improving crew manuals and pilot training.\n\n\u201cThese software changes will prevent the flight control conditions that occurred in this accident from ever happening again,\u201d Boeing said.\n\nAD\n\nLion Air Flight 610 crashed into the Java Sea on Oct. 29, shortly after taking off from Jakarta. All eight crew members and 181 passengers were killed.\n\nAD\n\nThe crash was soon tied to a new automated feature that Boeing had included on the 737 Max, a new version of its popular jet with larger, more fuel-efficient engines. Investigators say the feature was mistakenly triggered by faulty information from an external sensor.\n\nSimilar problems were blamed for the crash of an Ethio\u00adpian Airlines flight in March that killed 157 people. The Max has been grounded worldwide since shortly after that crash.\n\nOn Friday, officials from Indonesia\u2019s transportation safety regulator said nine factors worked together to doom the Lion Air jet.\n\n\u201cThese items were connected to each other. If one of them was not occurring on that day, the accident may not have happened,\u201d said Nurcahyo Utomo, an investigator at the National Transportation Safety Committee.\n\nAD\n\nThose factors included incorrect assumptions by Boeing about how pilots would respond to the new flight-control system, known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS. Investigators highlighted how the MCAS design relied on a single sensor and was therefore vulnerable to errors.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOne [angle of attack] affected the whole system,\u201d Nurcahyo said. A false reading on that sensor redirected the plane\u2019s nose downward, leaving the cockpit crew unable to override the auto\u00adpilot commands.\n\nOther fatal mistakes included a lack of training for pilots in the new system, a lack of documentation about problems in previous Lion Air flights involving the same jet and ineffective coordination between flight crews. Investigators concluded that the plane should have been grounded after an earlier fault.\n\nAD\n\nThe report offered stark new details on the backstory of an external sensor involved in the crash, pointing at the role of a maintenance firm in Florida and oversight by U.S. regulators.\n\nA dirty angle-of-attack sensor was sent to a Miramar-based company, Xtra Aerospace, for maintenance in 2017. It was then sent back and installed on the left side of the Lion Air flight the day before it plunged into the Java Sea, the report said.\n\nAD\n\nAngle-of-attack sensors are supposed to give pilots, and airplane systems, reliable information to help understand how the aircraft\u2019s nose is pointed in relation to oncoming wind.\n\nBut shortly after takeoff, the newly installed left sensor showed a reading that was different, by 21 degrees, from the one on the right. Investigators say that inaccurate reading caused Boeing\u2019s automated feature to mistakenly fire, again and again, before the plane eventually crashed.\n\nAD\n\nThe \u201csensor was most likely improperly calibrated at Xtra Aerospace,\u201d the Indonesian crash report said, noting that tests have been performed for the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board indicating that certain actions during the calibration process \u201ccould potentially introduce a bias\u201d in parts of the sensor.\n\nThe report said Xtra should have had a written procedure regarding the part of the process that may have gone wrong. The lack of such a written procedure was not detected by a relevant FAA office, the report said, and \u201cthis indicates inadequacy of FAA oversight.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe FAA said it issued an order revoking Xtra Aerospace\u2019s repair station certificate Friday, saying the company had \u201cfailed to comply with requirements to repair only aircraft parts on its list of parts acceptable to the FAA that it was capable of repairing.\u201d The FAA said it began investigating the company in November 2018, shortly after the Indonesia crash.\n\nAD\n\nAn Xtra employee in Florida referred questions to legal counsel at corporate parent Wencor Group, in Peachtree City, Ga. An employee at Wencor would not answer questions. A representative at an outside public relations firm said there would be \u201cno comment at this time.\u201d\n\nThe Indonesian report called for improved oversight by the FAA more broadly, and changes at Boeing as well as Lion Air.\n\nIndonesian investigators said their report was not aimed at pinpointing culpability but at ensuring passenger safety and preventing a similar accident. The report cannot be used for liability or compensation issues in court.\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement, Lion Air said it was essential to take \u201cimmediate corrective actions to ensure that an accident like this one never happens again.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCharles Herrmann, a Seattle attorney representing the families of 46 Lion Air crash victims, said the crash anniversary and the release of the report are \u201ca double wounding\u201d for his clients.\n\n\u201cThis is a devastating experience for these people,\u201d Herrmann said. \u201cIt involves not only tremendous sorrow and grief. There\u2019s a lot of anger.\u201d\n\nSince the crashes, Boeing\u2019s decision to adopt MCAS and the FAA\u2019s role in certifying the plane have come under intense scrutiny from the Justice Department, congressional investigators and lawyers representing the families of dozens of those who died.\n\nAhead of Friday\u2019s release of the crash investigation report, a review by the NTSB found that Boeing underestimated the risk posed by MCAS and made bad assumptions about how pilots would respond to a barrage of alerts in the cockpit if something went wrong.\n\nAnd an international group of aviation regulators and U.S. experts concluded that Boeing shared information with the FAA in a fragmented way, resulting in insufficient scrutiny of the new feature.\n\nMCAS was designed to kick in when pilots were flying manually, repeatedly pushing the plane\u2019s nose down if sensor data indicated that the aircraft was at risk of stalling. But the data that the system received in both the Lion Air and Ethio\u00adpian Airlines flights was faulty, causing the feature to kick in repeatedly while the pilots struggled to regain control of the aircraft.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe protracted grounding of the Max has battered Boeing\u2019s finances and its stock price. This week, the company reported that its revenue fell to $20 billion in the third quarter, down 21 percent from a year earlier. Profits were down 51 percent to $1.17 billion.\n\nThe company also announced the resignation this week of Kevin McAllister, head of the Boeing division that made the Max.\n\nThe company\u2019s fortunes rest on it winning approval from aviation regulators in the United States and abroad for the Max to resume flights.\n\nBoeing has redesigned the MCAS feature in a way that it says is safer, and the changes are being reviewed by aviation authorities. FAA officials say they have several more weeks\u2019 work to do, and airlines have said they are keeping the Max off their schedules into January and February.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBoeing\u2019s chief executive Dennis Muilenberg, who was stripped of his role as chairman of the company\u2019s board this month, is scheduled to testify about the Max before Senate and House committees next week. Lawmakers are weighing whether there ought to be changes to an FAA program that turns over to industry much of the responsibility for certifying that safety standards are being met.\n\nLion Air is Indonesia\u2019s largest budget airline, operating in a fast-growing industry across an archipelago where air travel is a necessity. But even before the crash a year ago, the country had a spotty safety record, and its carriers were banned from flying to the United States between 2007 and 2016.\n\nThe Max involved in the crash had entered service just months before. Lion Air was a major international customer for Boeing.\n\nAD\n\nThe pilot, 31-year-old Bhavye Suneja, was a native of India who had logged 6,000 flight hours. He was joined in the cockpit by a first officer who used only the single name Harvino and who had 5,000 hours of experience.\n\nVini Wulandari, Harvino\u2019s sister, said the investigation reinforced her family\u2019s belief that her brother was not to blame for the crash, and she demanded that Boeing take more responsibility for the loss of life.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning, I\u2019m sure that Harvino was innocent because he had done everything according to procedure,\u201d Vini said in an interview Friday. Her family is among those suing Boeing.\n\n\u201cSomeone must be held responsible for what has happened,\u201d she added.", "description": "Indonesian authorities identified nine factors that combined to cause the deadly accident that killed 189 people.", "authors": ["Ainur Rohmah", "Shibani Mahtani", "Reporter Covering Southeast Asia", "Hong Kong", "Ian Duncan", "Member Of The Transportation Team Focused On The U.S. Department Of Transportation", "Michael Laris", "Transportation Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KHKWGO1RaYEIc06vSLxWiAw31-w=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VDFA63HW7QI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
