But he\u2019s worried about a child support payment coming up at the end of the month and has talked to his case worker about temporarily reducing the payments.\n\nDennis Earl, president of UAW Local 14 in Toledo, said the union is doing what it can to help workers by advising them how to deal with bills that are piling up.\n\nThe union hall\u2019s kitchen is serving meals around the clock and donations of food and household items are pouring in from other labor groups in the area. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to go hungry,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs this goes on and becomes more difficult, there\u2019s going to be some agitation, but for the most part these people are in it for the long haul,\u201d he said.\n\nA Wall Street analyst estimates that GM has lost over $1.6 billion since the work stoppage began, and is now losing about $82 million per day. At some point, the losses will exceed what GM would save in holding out for more favorable terms from the union.\n\nGM dealers across the country report still-healthy inventory on their lots, but they\u2019re running short of parts to fix their customers\u2019 vehicles, and some have had to cancel service appointments.\n\nThe strike immediately shut down about 30 GM factories across the U.S., essentially ending the company\u2019s production. Factories in Canada and Mexico remained open for a while, but one assembly plant in Canada and another in Mexico have been forced to shut down due to parts shortages. Analysts expect the closures to spread to the few remaining plants that are open.\n\nMany workers stocked away emergency cash after being warned for months by union leaders about the possibility of a strike, but they said GM\u2019s temporary workers who make much less couldn\u2019t do that.\n\n\u201cWe all knew this was coming for a long time, I\u2019m set up. A lot of guys aren\u2019t in that same spot,\u201d said Tim Leiby, an eight-year employee in Toledo. \u201cI\u2019ve got all my bills paid, but I know some people who don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nStill, he\u2019s cutting back on eating out, going to the movies and spending money on hobbies because \u201cwe don\u2019t know how long this will last.\u201d\n\nHe also said he has a cousin who won\u2019t talk to him now because the strike has shut down the welding shop where she works.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s affecting everybody, it\u2019s affecting families. Even families that don\u2019t work here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Anderson Economic Group, a consulting firm in East Lansing, Michigan, estimates that 75,000 workers at auto parts supply companies have been laid off or had their wages reduced because of the strike.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t include waitresses, convenience store clerks and others who are seeing their hours cut because striking workers aren\u2019t out spending money.\n\nTruck driver Glen Hodge, who hauls scrap metal from a stamping plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, has been off the job the past three weeks.\n\nSince then, he\u2019s filed for unemployment, dropped his cable TV package, stopped going out to eat with his wife and even cut back on dog treats. It upsets him a bit when he sees gift cards and donations pouring in for the striking workers.\n\n\u201cWhat about the rest of us?\u201d he said on Wednesday. \u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of us sitting around getting nothing.\u201d\n\n___\n\nKrisher reported from Romulus, Michigan.
