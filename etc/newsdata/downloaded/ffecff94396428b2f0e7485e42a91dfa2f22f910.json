REUTERS/Samrang Pring\n\nThe case has added to concerns about a crackdown on criticism and dissent by Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who extended his rule of more than three decades in an election last year after the main opposition party leader was arrested on treason charges here and his party banned.\n\nPhnom Penh Municipal Court Judge Im Vannak had been scheduled to deliver a verdict in the two-year-old case against the reporters, Uon Chhin and Yeang Sothearin, but instead he ordered a fresh investigation into hard disks seized when they were arrested in 2017.\n\nRadio Free Asia (RFA) and rights groups said the case should be dropped.\n\n\u201cThese delays drag out an unnecessary ordeal that has unfolded for almost two years,\u201d RFA\u2019s spokesperson, Rohit Mohajan, told Reuters.\n\nThe two former reporters for Washington-based RFA, a non-profit broadcaster that receives funding from a U.S. government agency, were arrested in November 2017.\n\nRFA had earlier shut down its Phnom Penh office citing a \u201crelentless crackdown on independent voices\u201d which made it impossible for it to guarantee the integrity of its journalistic mission.\n\nThe two were charged with providing information \u201cdestructive to national defence to a foreign state\u201d after they were caught filing stories to RFA, the court said at the time.\n\nThey denied the charges. Their lawyer said they had merely been doing their jobs as journalists.\n\nThe arrests came as Hun Sen was fighting a war of words with the U.S. embassy and State Department over his government\u2019s crackdown on the opposition.\n\nThe veteran leader has accused the United States of trying to end his rule.\n\nYeang Sothearin told Reuters outside the court he was disappointed with the judge\u2019s order for more investigation.\n\n\u201cThis is another delay of my rights being restricted and freedom being pressured,\u201d he said.\n\nNicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International\u2019s regional director for East and Southeast Asia, called on the court to dismiss the case.\n\n\u201cThe Cambodian authorities are using trumped-up charges to make an example of two brave professional journalists and to silence anyone else who dares to speak truth to power in Cambodia.\u201d\n\nHuman Rights Watch\u2019s Phil Robertson said the case \u201cwas politically motivated from day one\u201d and should not continue.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\n\u201cThe judge\u2019s admission there is no real evidence should have prompted the dismissal of the case, not a re-investigation which will plunge these journalists back into a never-ending nightmare,\u201d Robertson said.\n\nThe opposition has termed Cambodia essentially a one-party state here after Hun Sen\u2019s party won all of the seats in parliament in a 2018 election, after the Supreme Court disbanded the main opposition party.\n\nAuthorities have arrested at least 30 opposition activists this year, accusing them of plotting to overthrow the government ahead of the planned return from self-exile of former opposition leader Sam Rainsy on Nov. 9.", "description": "A Cambodian judge on Thursday ordered a reinvestigation of the espionage case against two former Radio Free Asia journalists, saying he could not rule on their guilt or innocence without enough evidence.", "authors": ["Prak Chan Thul", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436492863&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9204F"}
