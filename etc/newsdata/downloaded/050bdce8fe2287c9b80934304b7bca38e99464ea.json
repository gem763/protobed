A senior Revolutionary Guards commander warned that the Islamic Republic was ready for \"full-fledged\" war.\n\n\"All American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometers around Iran are within the range of our missiles,\" the semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted commander Amirali Hajizadeh as saying.\n\nState oil giant Saudi Aramco said the attack cut output by 5.7 million barrels per day, at a time when Aramco is trying to ready itself for what is expected to be the world's largest share sale.\n\nAramco gave no timeline for output resumption. A source close to the matter told Reuters the return to full oil capacity could take \"weeks, not days\".\n\nAnother source briefed on the developments said Saudi oil exports would continue to run as normal this week thanks to large storage in the kingdom.\n\nBut it remains unclear how long the oil production shut down will continue, because the damage to the infrastructure \"was big\" and could not be fixed overnight, the source added.\n\nTraders and analysts said crude may spike to as high as $100 if Riyadh fails to quickly bring back supply.\n\nThe kingdom, the world's top oil exporter, ships more than 7 million barrels of oil to global destinations every day.\n\nRiyadh said it would compensate for the loss by drawing on its stocks which stood at 188 million barrels in June, according to official data. The United States said it was also ready to tap emergency oil reserves if needed.\n\nThe Saudi bourse closed down 1.1% with banking and petrochemical shares taking the biggest hit. Saudi petrochemical firms announced a significant reduction in feedstock supplies.\n\n\"Abqaiq is the nerve center of the Saudi energy system. Even if exports resume in the next 24-48 hours, the image of invulnerability has been altered,\" Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told Reuters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK\"\n\nAccording to U.S. government information, 15 structures at Abqaiq suffered damage on their west-northwest facing sides.\n\nPompeo said there was no evidence the attack came from Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Houthis for over four years in a conflict widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Muslim rival Iran.\n\n\"Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply,\" he said.\n\nSome Iraqi media outlets said the attack came from there. Baghdad denied this on Sunday and vowed to punish anyone using Iraq, where Iran-backed paramilitary groups wield increasing power, as a launchpad for attacks.\n\nKuwait, which borders Iraq, said it was investigating the sighting of a drone over its territory and coordinating with Saudi Arabia and other countries. The cabinet said the prime minister ordered tighter security at vital installations.\n\nRiyadh accused Iran of being behind previous attacks on oil pumping stations and the Shaybah oilfield, charges Tehran denies. It has not yet blamed any party for Saturday's strike, but linked it to a recent series of attacks on Saudi oil assets and crude tankers in Gulf waters.\n\nRiyadh says Iran arms the Houthis, a charge both deny.\n\nRegional tensions have escalated since Washington quit an international nuclear deal and extended sanctions on Iran.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Saturday's attacks and called on all parties to exercises restraint and prevent any escalation.", "description": "Iran rejected accusations by the United States that it was behind attacks on Saudi oil plants that risk disrupting world energy supplies and warned on Sunday that U.S. bases and aircraft carriers in the region were in range of its missiles.
