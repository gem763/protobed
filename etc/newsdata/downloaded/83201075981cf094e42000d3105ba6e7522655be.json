How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Yet sometimes, investors buy a stock for its dividend and lose money because the share price falls by more than they earned in dividend payments.\n\nA 2.1% yield is nothing to get excited about, but investors probably think the long payment history suggests 1st Source has some staying power. The company also bought back stock equivalent to around 1.8% of market capitalisation this year. Some simple analysis can offer a lot of insights when buying a company for its dividend, and we'll go through this below.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on 1st Source!\n\nNasdaqGS:SRCE Historical Dividend Yield, October 29th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. In the last year, 1st Source paid out 7.6% of its profit as dividends. We'd say its dividends are thoroughly covered by earnings.\n\nConsider getting our latest analysis on 1st Source's financial position here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. 1st Source has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. This dividend has been unstable, which we define as having fallen by at least 20% one or more times over this time. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.51 in 2009, compared to US$1.08 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 7.8% a year over that time. The growth in dividends has not been linear, but the CAGR is a decent approximation of the rate of change over this time frame.\n\nDividends have grown at a reasonable rate, but with at least one substantial cut in the payments, we're not certain this dividend stock would be ideal for someone intending to live on the income.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Why take the risk of a dividend getting cut, unless there's a good chance of bigger dividends in future? Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see 1st Source has grown its earnings per share at 12% per annum over the past five years. Earnings per share are growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low. We think this is an ideal combination in a dividend stock.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo summarise, shareholders should always check that 1st Source's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. We're glad to see 1st Source has a low payout ratio, as this suggests earnings are being reinvested in the business. Next, earnings growth has been good, but unfortunately the dividend has been cut at least once in the past. 1st Source has a number of positive attributes, but falls short of our ideal dividend company. It may be worth a look at the right price, though.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Is 1st Source Corporation (NASDAQ:SRCE) a good dividend stock? How can we tell?
