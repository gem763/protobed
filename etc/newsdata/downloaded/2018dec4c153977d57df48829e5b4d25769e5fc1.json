Stand with Hong Kong.\" The tweeted featured the symbol of Stand With Hong Kong, an activist group that has been behind calls for foreign government intervention in Hong Kong amid escalating protests.\n\nMorey's tweet drew criticism from Chinese social media users.\n\nIn response, the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA), whose president is former Rockets center Yao Ming, announced it was suspending its relationship with the team. Several Chinese companies, including the state broadcaster China Central Television and the livestreaming platform Tencent Sports, announced they would not broadcast Rockets games.\n\nAccording to The Athletic's Shams Charania, the CBA canceled a planned G League game between the Rockets' affiliate, the Rio Grande Valley Vipers and the Texas Legends.\n\nThe response from China hits the league hard. According to Sports Illustrated's Chris Mannix, the NBA signed a five-year deal with Tencent in June worth at least $500 million. China has been one of the league's growing markets, with nearly 500 million viewers watching NBA games on Tencent last season. The NBA has invested time and money into growing the Chinese fan base. The Oklahoma City Thunder, Los Angeles Lakers, and Brooklyn Nets are all set to play preseason games in China over the next week.\n\nHouston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta responded in a tweet saying Morey's views don't represent the Rockets and that the organization is non-political.\n\nMorey also issued an apology on Twitter, saying, \"I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\" he wrote. \"I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event.\"\n\nBrooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai also released a lengthy response on Facebook, explaining why Chinese fans might have been offended by Morey's tweet. He said, \" The hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.\"\n\nRead more: An NBA executive is facing major backlash in China after tweeting support for the Hong Kong protests\n\nHowever, it is the NBA's response to the issue that has drawn criticisms from the sports and political world alike.\n\nThe NBA issued a statement on Sunday, saying that while Morey's tweet may have offended Chinese citizens, the league hopes sports can unify people.\n\nHowever, Twitter user Yiqin Fu first noticed that the league's statement on Chinese social media app Weibo appeared to be different than the English version.\n\nThe New York Times' Sopan Deb tweeted that the New York Times also found a different translation. According to Deb, the NBA said there should be no discrepancy between the statements and that the league stands by the English statement.\n\nIn the wake of the NBA's statements, several politicians criticized the league for appeasing the Chinese government and protecting their bottom line.\n\nMany in the sports world jumped in on the criticisms, too.\n\nDan Wolken of USA Today brought up Enes Kanter, who has an arrest warrant in Turkey because of his criticisms of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Kanter has not returned to Turkey and didn't travel overseas for fear of being targeted by supporters of Erdogan.\n\nMannix wrote:\n\n\"The league is a strong supporter of its players and coaches taking stands on social issues, yet punts on its own opportunity to back an executive taking a position on one ... The league supports the causes of its members \u2026 just not ones that impact the bottom line.\"\n\nWith several Chinese basketball teams playing preseason games in the U.S. and LeBron James, one of the world's biggest sports stars, heading to China for a preseason game, the matter \u2014 which some are calling the biggest crisis of Commissioner Adam Silver's tenure \u2014 is unlikely to die down soon.", "description": "Politicians and sports figures alike have criticized the NBA for caring about their bottom line and appeasing China.", "authors": ["Scott Davis"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9b6c0f138e4a36237dce77?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
