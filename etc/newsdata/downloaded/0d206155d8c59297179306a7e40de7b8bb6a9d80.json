He achieved mainstream success with the album Come Over When You\u2019re Sober, Pt. 1. He died aged 21 after being found unresponsive on a tour bus in Arizona. The suit claims that he was pushed \u201cto the extreme bounds of what somebody of his age and maturity level could handle emotionally, mentally, and physically\u201d.\n\nNamed in the suit are British First Access Entertainment chief executive Sarah Stennett, who has worked with singers including Rita Ora and Zayn Malik, and Belinda Mercer, who was the manager on the rapper\u2019s final tour. The suit alleged that Stennett would gift him with bottles of pills, citing text messages where she would offer Xanax. Mercer, who was allegedly in a sexual relationship with \u00c5hr, would also provide him with drugs, including ketamine. According to Variety, the lawsuit alleges that the night before his death Mercer \u201cbegged the local tour staff for heavy drugs\u201d.\n\nSimilar claims were originally made in a Rolling Stone article earlier this year and Stennett spoke about her view of his drug-taking. \u201cI said, \u2018Look, I\u2019m not here to chastise you for taking drugs \u2013 that\u2019s not my job. What I can tell you is it\u2019s very hard to reach your potential if you\u2019re a drug user,\u2019\u201d she said. She also denied giving him any form of drug.\n\nWhen speaking of \u00c5hr\u2019s death, Womack\u2019s lawyer Paul A Matiasic has said: \u201cWe acknowledge, obviously, that Gus had a role\u201d but that \u201cin evaluating the legal responsibility for someone\u2019s untimely death, it is not a binary decision\u201d. He said that First Access \u201chad the power, they had the influence and control over Gus\u2019s career, and specifically this tour\u201d and that \u201cthere are duties associated with having that type of control\u201d.\n\nThe suit is seeking unspecified damages for negligence, breach of contract and wrongful death. Representatives for Stennett and First Access Entertainment have yet to respond to requests for comment.", "description": "Liza Womack claims son\u2019s overdose occurred after negligence from company that \u2018fostered, promoted and encouraged\u2019 illegal drug use", "authors": ["Guardian Music"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca907117d7d2ae47832e461da899ef5c43b75b8c/0_111_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fcbc9cff11e38805ab6319c874cfb75e", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
