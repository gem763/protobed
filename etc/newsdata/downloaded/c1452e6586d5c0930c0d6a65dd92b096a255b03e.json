Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Kamala Harris (D-CA) reminded voters that they opposed Kavanaugh's confirmation last fall.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar on Justice Brett Kavanaugh: \"I strongly opposed him, based on his views on executive power, which will continue to haunt our country, as well as how he behaved, including the allegations that we are hearing more about today\" https://t.co/gxl9RihwwF pic.twitter.com/pvjUbSfTS9 \u2014 This Week (@ThisWeekABC) September 15, 2019\n\nI sat through those hearings. Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people. He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice.\n\n\n\nHe must be impeached. \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 15, 2019\n\nBut each of the presidential candidates had one common talking point: they felt the Department of Justice failed to properly investigate the allegations made by Deborah Ramirez and Christine Blasey Ford. And, because of that, they believe Kavanaugh should be impeached.\n\nIt\u2019s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath. He should be impeached.\n\n\n\nAnd Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter. https://t.co/Yg1eh0CkNl \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) September 15, 2019\n\nLast year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 15, 2019\n\nYesterday, we learned of another accusation against Brett Kavanaugh\u2014one we didn't find out about before he was confirmed because the Senate forced the F.B.I. to rush its investigation to save his nomination. We know he lied under oath. He should be impeached. \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 15, 2019\n\nAs a federal judge who overwhelmingly sided with corporate power and Wall Street, Brett Kavanaugh should never have been nominated. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 15, 2019\n\nSupreme Court justices are not above the law. Someone who sits in judgment over the nation should have the highest integrity. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 15, 2019\n\nThe revelations today confirm what we already knew: During his hearing, Kavanaugh faced credible accusations and likely lied to Congress. I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 15, 2019\n\nAlthough the Times claims to have this \"new allegation\" before them, a previous Times piece said they couldn't find any corroborating evidence of Ramirez's claims:", "description": "Of course..09/15/2019 19:05:58PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/228/b51b98f7-596c-4425-8650-57afe3d21f1a.png", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
