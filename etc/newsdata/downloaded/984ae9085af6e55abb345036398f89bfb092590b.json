It\u2019s not a reboot, but it\u2019s \u201csomething\u201d.\n\nAppearing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Jen surprised huge Friends fan Charlie Puth during his interview. And where there\u2019s an OG Friends star, there\u2019s talk of a reboot. Always. No doubt about it.\n\nSo like many times before, Ellen asked Jen about a potential Friends reunion.\n\n\u201cLike, a reboot of the show? No.\u201d Jen answered, which checks out. The cast and writers have all been adamant about there being no reboot.\n\n\u201cListen we would love for there to be something, but we don\u2019t know what that something is. So we\u2019re just trying \u2013 we\u2019re really, we\u2019re working on something.\u201d\n\nSomething. Something.\n\nEllen tried to push for more deets but Jen wasn\u2019t budging. Could it be a movie? A different series? A little Christmas special? A 25 Year Anniversary special? Who knows.\n\n(Jen said she didn\u2019t want to lead anyone on but oops, TOO LATE)\n\nSo then, Ellen asked about Jen\u2019s first IG post \u2013 which, if you haven\u2019t seen, is a group selfie of the OG gang.\n\nBAM.\n\n\u201cWe did that because we miss each other and we all happened to be in the same part of the world,\u201d the actor explained of the pic.\n\nSure. Neither Charlie nor Ellen believed her either. Actually, they\u2019re pretty convinced the IG post was the start of something big.\n\nStay tuned friends, stay tuned.\n\nYou can watch the interview on EllenTube right here.", "description": "Jennifer Aniston\u00a0says - she actually said it - the Friends\u00a0cast is \"working on something\".
