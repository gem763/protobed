Our current policies on fact checking people in political office, or those running for office, are a threat to what FB stands for. We strongly object to this policy as it stands. It doesn't protect voices, but instead allows politicians to weaponize our platform by targeting people who believe that content posted by political figures is trustworthy.\"\n\nIn October, Facebook decided to exempt politicians' advertisements from its broader rules that ban falsehoods in ads \u2014 effectively giving the all-clear to politicians to spread deliberate falsehoods on Facebook's advertising platform without repercussions. The decision has proved intensely controversial, with Democrats warning that it could impact the 2020 election, even as Zuckerberg defends the position on free speech grounds.\n\nBut not all of the 34-year-old billionaire chief executive's employees agree with him.\n\nIn the open letter, which was published on Facebook's internal forum Workplace, the Facebook employees made six key requests. These are:\n\nFacebook should ban false political ads, like it does with other, non-political ads.\n\nPolitical ads should be more clearly distinguished in Facebook's newsfeed from normal (non-paid) content.\n\nThe targeting tools for political ads on Facebook should be restricted.\n\nFacebook should observe \"election silence periods.\"\n\nPoliticians should have spending caps on the amount of political ads they can run.\n\nPolicies on political ads should be clarified (regardless of any changes) to make them easier for users to understand.\n\nIn an emailed statement, Facebook spokesperson Bertie Thomson told Business Insider that the company welcomed the employee input.\n\n\"Facebook's culture is built on openness so we appreciate our employees voicing their thoughts on this important topic. We remain committed to not censoring political speech, and will continue exploring additional steps we can take to bring increased transparency to political ads,\" she wrote.\n\nDo you work at Facebook?
