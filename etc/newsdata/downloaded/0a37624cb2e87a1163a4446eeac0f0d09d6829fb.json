NFLX, +3.17% surged 1.4% in morning trading Thursday, after Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry reiterated his bullish stance ahead of the streaming video giant's third-quarter results due out next week, but slashed his price target to below the Wall Street average. While Terry expects Netflix to report results \"roughly in-line\" with guidance of 7 million net subscriber additions, he said data showing that app downloads have been declining suggest a \"modest risk\" to the downside. He reiterated the buy rating he's had on the stock for at least the past three years, but cut his price target to $360 from $420, citing reduced earnings expectations and valuation contraction among internet names. The average target of the 40 analysts surveyed by FactSet is $384.97. Terry cut his 2019 EPS estimate to $3.17 from $3.24. He remains bullish, he said, because he believes the impact of a strong fourth-quarter content slate and a more stable pricing environment will boost fourth-quarter subscriber growth above current Street expectations. Separately, UBS analyst Eric Sheridan maintained his buy rating but cut his price target to $370 from $420. The stock has tumbled 28.8% over the past three months, amid concerns over intensifying competition, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.85% has slipped 2.3%.", "description": "Shares of Netflix Inc. surged 1.4% in morning trading Thursday, after Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry reiterated his bullish stance ahead of the streaming...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
