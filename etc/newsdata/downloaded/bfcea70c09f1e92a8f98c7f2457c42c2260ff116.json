Gavin Newsom said he would sign a bill banning flavored e-cigarettes if the state legislature sent one his way.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see that bill on my desk,\u201d Mr. Newsom said at a Sacramento, Calif., press conference on Monday. \u201cI would like to sign a bill to eliminate the legal use of flavored e-cigarettes.\u201d\n\nMr. Newsom said he lacked the power to ban e-cigarettes by executive order. For now, he said he would increase scrutiny of flavored e-cigarettes after several deaths in recent weeks were tied to marijuana or nicotine vaping devices.\n\nHe signed an executive order directing state agencies to crack down on illegal and counterfeit vaping products, begin a new public awareness campaign and create recommendations for new warning signs at retailers and on product advertisements. Mr. Newsom also signed a bill increasing age-verification requirements for purchasing such products online or by mail.\n\nMr. Newsom\u2019s actions came shortly after New York state officials said they were planning emergency regulations to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes to stem a rise in teenage vaping. The move by New York followed a ban in Michigan and an announcement last week by the Trump administration that it intended to pull vaping products off the market except for those formulated to taste like tobacco.\n\nThe state actions come as health authorities across the U.S. have investigated a rash of pulmonary illnesses and several deaths associated with vaping products, many containing cannabis.\n\nA spokesman for Juul Labs Inc., the market leader in e-cigarettes, said the company was reviewing Mr. Newsom\u2019s order and agreed with the governor\u2019s move to take action against counterfeit and imitation products.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to combat youth usage, while supporting reasonable access to vapor products for adults looking to switch from combustible cigarettes,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nAlso on Monday, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot called for a ban on the sale of flavored e-cigarettes in that city. At a press conference, she said a ban of all sales of electronic cigarettes and the cartridges of liquid used to fill them would be more complicated after a local lawmaker proposed that measure.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to look at that, but we\u2019re going to start with the flavored tobacco, particularly because we know this is the gateway in which children become addicted,\u201d Ms. Lightfoot said. \u201cReally our big focus here: we want to do much more in terms of public awareness and attack this notion that this is a safe alternative to smoking.\u201d\n\nWrite to Alejandro Lazo at alejandro.lazo@wsj.com", "description": "California Gov.
