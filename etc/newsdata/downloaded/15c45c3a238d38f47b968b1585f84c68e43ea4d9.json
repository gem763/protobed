Gavin Newsom, who has repeatedly blasted PG&E \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest utility \u2014 for what he calls years of mismanagement and underinvestment that have left its grid less resilient.\n\nTwice over the past two weeks, PG&E has cut power to large areas of Northern and Central California to reduce the risk of its equipment sparking fires. An estimated 2.5 million people lost electricity earlier this month, and then as many as a half-million this week.\n\nBut PG&E\u2019s decision to shut down distribution lines but not long-distance transmission lines may have backfired this time when a blaze erupted near the Sonoma County wine country town of Geyserville.\n\nThe fire burned at least 49 buildings and 34 square miles (65 square kilometers) and prompted evacuation orders for some 2,000 people. No serious injuries were reported.\n\nPG&E said a live, 230,000-volt transmission line near Geyserville had malfunctioned minutes before the fire erupted Wednesday night, and a broken \u201cjumper\u201d wire was found on a transmission tower.\n\nPG&E CEO Bill Johnson said it was too soon to say whether the faulty equipment sparked the fire. He said the tower had been inspected four times in the past two years and appeared to have been in excellent condition.\n\nBut PG&E stock plummeted 31 percent on the news. And the blaze could mean wider blackouts ahead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a logical next step to say, \u2018Well, if our high-voltage transmission lines are at risk, we\u2019ve got to shut those down too,'\u201d said Alan Scheller-Wolf, professor of operations management and an energy expert at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nPG&E, he said, \u201ccan\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nWith dangerously high winds in the forecast this weekend, the utility said it is planning another major shutdown that could hit 2 million people throughout the region starting Saturday night and last up to two days.\n\nThe preparations came as firefighters simultaneously battled flames in both Northern and Southern California: the fire amid Sonoma County\u2019s vineyards, and a wind-whipped blaze that destroyed at least six homes in the Santa Clarita area near Los Angeles and led to evacuation orders covering an estimated 50,000 people.\n\nThe possible link between the wine country fire and a PG&E transmission line contained grim parallels to the catastrophic fire last year that tore through the town of Paradise, killing 85 people and destroying thousands of homes in the deadliest U.S. fire in a century. State officials concluded that fire was sparked by a PG&E transmission line.\n\nThe line that failed this week is newer and should have been more robust, said Michael Wara, director of the climate and energy program at Stanford University. Its failure will probably make PG&E more cautious, which means more widespread blackouts, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be more collateral damage,\u201d Wara said.\n\nTurning off big transmission lines reduces the stability of the electrical grid, leading to bigger outages, Wara said. Transmissions lines also take longer to re-energize because everything connected to them must be inspected, he said.\n\nPG&E\u2019s CEO has said it will take about a decade before widespread outages aren\u2019t necessary.\n\nMinimizing blackouts will require PG&E to harden its grid with stronger poles and newer equipment less likely to fall or spark. Cameras, weather sensors and a more segmented grid would allow the company to target blackouts to areas in the most danger.\n\nPG&E began resorting to large-scale shut-offs after its equipment was blamed for several blazes in recent years that killed scores of people, burned thousands of homes and ran up billions of dollars in claims that drove the utility into bankruptcy, where it is still trying to put its finances in order.\n\nThe repeated and sometimes lengthy blackouts have frustrated Californians contending with uncertainty, spoiled food and disrupted plans. Many have complained about poor communication from the power company.\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019re being held hostage for their failings and their incompetence,\u201d said Logan Martin, 55, of Santa Rosa.\n\nThis year\u2019s fire season in California has so far been mild, with fewer deaths and fewer acres burned following two years of deadly conflagrations.\n\nExperts say it is impossible to know how much the blackouts contributed to that, but PG&E has cited numerous instances of wind damage to its equipment that it said could have caused fires if the lines had been electrified.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jocelyn Gecker contributed from San Francisco.", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 A wildfire in California wine country that may have been caused by a high-voltage transmission line called into question Pacific", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/25/7f528b_california-wildfires-10303-firefighters-try-put-out-residence-caused-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
