But he never really went away.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus near his ranch, enjoying his third moment of superstardom, which came via \u201cOld Town Road.\u201d (Nathan Morgan for The Washington Post)\n\nOn this hot August morning, Billy Ray Cyrus sits in the family room of his brother\u2019s house, which lies adjacent to his own sprawling property in the bucolic hinterlands of Nashville. He\u2019s talking about \u2014 what else? \u2014 \u201cOld Town Road,\u201d then in its 19th week at the top of the charts, the longest such streak in history. At this moment, it still feels unstoppable, but Cyrus, a longtime student of chart positions, senses its record-shattering run is almost over, and he\u2019s right. Within days, he and Lil Nas X will be deposed by Billie Eilish\u2019s \u201cBad Guy.\u201d\n\nBut the unlikely collaboration between the 58-year-old country singer from Flatwoods, Ky., and the 20-year-old rapper from Atlanta was still the unquestioned soundtrack of summer, ascending from viral smash to mainstream hit to world-eating cultural phenomenon. It created a special bond between the pair, which makes sense because Cyrus is one of the few people who can understand the very peculiar position currently occupied by Lil Nas X. \u201cAchy Breaky Heart\u201d was the \u201cOld Town Road\u201d of its day, a genre-bending, gatekeeper-offending, once-in-a-generation crossover sensation that changed the culture forever. \u201cThis young man had clearly defined exactly what he wanted to happen, and that\u2019s the way you reach your dreams,\u201d Cyrus says approvingly.\n\nCyrus is serious and polite and peppers his conversation with a mixture of backwoods mysticism, shrewd observations on the entertainment industry and Dale Carnegie-esque inspirational sayings. He believes in intuition, and spirits. He looks for signs in things. He\u2019s a you-miss-one-hundred-percent-of-the-shots-you-don\u2019t-take kind of guy.\n\nHe has also been at the forefront of the cultural conversation at three pivotal and very different points in the last 30 years: for \u201cAchy Breaky,\u201d the Disney Channel smash \u201cHannah Montana,\u201d in which he played the father of his real-life daughter Miley, and \u201cOld Town Road.\u201d But Billy Ray Cyrus was always here, plugging along, even when the conversation turned away from him. He has been directed by David Lynch and befriended by George Jones, and he just performed at Glastonbury. How weird is that?\n\nUnlike \u201cFriends\u201d or the Spice Girls, \u201cAchy Breaky Heart\u201d was a piece of \u201990s pop culture few people felt nostalgic for. \u201cI wish Billy Ray Cyrus would make a comeback\u201d is not something anybody has ever said out loud, probably not even Billy Ray Cyrus.\n\nLil Nas X didn\u2019t care about any of that, or maybe he just didn\u2019t know. He had grown up with \u201cHannah Montana,\u201d and Cyrus was one of the only country singers he was familiar with. In December, the rapper, hoping to create a viral moment for his brand-new country-trap song, tweeted in Cyrus\u2019s direction (\u201ctwitter please help me get billy ray cyrus on this\u201d).\n\nIn mid-March, Cyrus got an email from an executive at Columbia Records, asking whether he would listen to a track by a young Atlanta artist named Lil Nas X. There was an accompanying link to a site called TikTok. Cyrus was mystified. \u201cI\u2019m going, \u2018Who is Lil Nas? And what is TikTok?\u2019 \u201d\n\nTikTok, Cyrus soon discovered, was a social media app specializing in highly meme-able homemade videos. He was mad at himself for not already knowing that. \u201cI\u2019m a student of the game. I should have known what TikTok is. I\u2019m always looking for the next competitive edge.\u201d\n\n\n\nCyrus and his \u201cOld Town Road\u201d collaborator, Lil Nas X. (Frazer Harrison/Getty Images for Stagecoach)\n\nCyrus made plans to enter the studio the next day. He spent hours studying \u201cOld Town Road\u201d like it was homework. \u201c[I] learned it really good,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause it was different for me, but I loved it.\u201d\n\nCyrus was paired with hip-hop artist and songwriter Jocelyn \u201cJozzy\u201d Donald, who worked with him on his guest verse. Jozzy told Cyrus that her mom had a crush on him during the \u201cAchy Breaky\u201d years, which he didn\u2019t seem to find surprising. Everybody\u2019s mom did.\n\nJozzy told Cyrus she wanted him to approach the song as a rapper would. \u201cI said, \u2018We\u2019re going to role reverse,\u2019 \u201d Jozzy recalled. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be Magic Johnson, and Lil Nas is going to be Larry Bird. We\u2019ve gotta get you the hottest bars.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt was around this time that the original version of \u201cOld Town Road\u201d was deemed insufficiently country, and it was removed from the Billboard country charts. The decision brought usually subterranean issues of race and genre in the music industry into the daylight. Cyrus says he can\u2019t really speculate on those, but he knew that whatever was happening wasn\u2019t good. He was also worried that, as the designated country guy, his services would no longer be needed on a song he felt a connection to. \u201cI started freaking because something inside my spirit knew that this was a special moment, and something very important in my life,\u201d he recalls. \u201cMy spirit was just going crazy, and I kept pushing. It just looked like it was going to go away.\u201d\n\nWhen the remix landed atop the Billboard Top 100 a few weeks later, it wasn\u2019t just a hit, it was a populist uprising. And it was something that looked familiar. \u201cThe country world was trying to do to Lil Nas exactly what they did to Billy Ray Cyrus with \u2018Achy Breaky,\u2019 \u201d Jozzy says. \u201cThis was his redemption, a little bit.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in Kentucky, Cyrus played baseball. He wanted to go pro, but when a voice inside his head told him he would be a musician instead, he listened. \u201cWhen I traded that catcher\u2019s mitt in and bought a left-handed guitar, I didn\u2019t look back,\u201d he says. For 10 demoralizing years, he struggled. He briefly moved to Southern California in search of a record deal and became a successful car salesman instead. He returned home, got married, got divorced and built up a local following. During a now-legendary stand at the Ragtime Lounge in Huntington, W.Va., he played to overflow crowds every night, an early version of the all-encompassing international celebrity that would follow.\n\nCyrus could have reigned there indefinitely, but he was closing in on 30, and he worried that if he didn\u2019t get a record deal soon, he never would. And he was starting to get a bad feeling about the Ragtime. \u201cI felt like I was gonna die,\u201d Cyrus recalls. He means it literally. \u201cThe bar was getting pretty rough, and it was getting so packed, it was uncontrollable. Like, every single night, you just couldn\u2019t get people in there. It was getting crazy.\u201d\n\n\n\nCyrus at the height of \u201cAchy Breaky Heart\u201d mania in 1992. (Mark Humphrey/AP)\n\nHis intuition also told him something good was about to happen. He played his song \u201cSome Gave All,\u201d an ode to veterans that Cyrus views as the most consequential song of his entire career, for Harold Shedd at Mercury Records and got a record deal on the spot.\n\nHis first single was a goofy, danceable ear worm called \u201cDon\u2019t Tell My Heart.\u201d At least that\u2019s what it was called until Cyrus, who had field-tested the song for audiences at the Ragtime, politely suggested renaming it \u201cAchy Breaky Heart.\u201d\n\nCyrus and the song\u2019s writer, Don Von Tress, soon became close friends. \u201cI was struck by his charisma and his honesty,\u201d Von Tress recalls. \u201cBack in the day when everybody had to have a Stetson stapled to their forehead, here\u2019s this guy with a mullet and a cut off sweatshirt and high-top tennies.\u201d\n\nCyrus approached his impending stardom like he was training for the pursuit of a sports championship. He quit drinking, for one thing. \u201cTo this day, I can\u2019t even drink a beer or nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cMy inner voice said, \u2018You\u2019re gonna have to really be on top of your game, and alcohol could be a problem.\u2019 . . . I just quit. If I hadn\u2019t, it\u2019d be a different deal for me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d even be alive. (Then) \u2018Achy Breaky\u2019 came out, and I just ran with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAchy Breaky\u201d was instantly polarizing. Pop fans embraced it as a novelty hit. Country purists saw it as degrading and ridiculous. (That the accompanying video, featuring a hip-swiveling Cyrus, helped set off a nationwide line-dancing craze somehow made it worse.) His debut album went on to sell 9 million copies.\n\nSuccess was alienating. Cyrus toured and recorded nonstop, with Von Tress his frequent collaborator and travel companion. It was hard for them to relate to anybody else. \u201cWe were right in the middle of that tornado,\u201d Von Tress recalls. \u201cWhen it exploded, it was just mind-boggling. It dominated everything.\u201d\n\nArtists often have complicated relationships with the hits that made them famous: Sometimes a song isn\u2019t representative of their body of work, or it\u2019s embarrassing, or they just tire of it. Ask Cyrus whether this might be the case for him, and he looks incredulous. \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d he asks. \u201cAre you nuts? Don\u2019t ever think that about me.\u201d\n\nCyrus had enough post-\u201cAchy Breaky\u201d hits to fend off official one-hit-wonder status, but by the release of his third album, country radio no longer welcomed him. His father suggested he reinvent himself as an actor, like Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton did. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m not an actor,\u2019 \u201d Cyrus recalls. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just like everything else. You just gotta start. You\u2019ll learn.\u2019 \u201d\n\nParton and Cyrus had been friends for years. Parton embraced the entire Cyrus family, which grew to include his second wife, Tish, and six kids. (Dolly is godmother to Miley.) Parton describes Cyrus in an email thusly: \u201cHe\u2019s tender but tough, pretty but rugged, mysterious but personable. He\u2019s a man\u2019s man but definitely a woman\u2019s kind of guy! Oh, and did I mention he\u2019s talented? He\u2019s a great singer, songwriter, and entertainer. I\u2019ve loved him from the start.\u201d\n\nParton also urged him to diversify. Cyrus set his mind to acting and soon found himself with a small part in Lynch\u2019s 2001 mind-bending masterpiece, \u201cMulholland Drive.\u201d The director proved influential in molding the singer\u2019s minimalist acting style. \u201cHe was encouraging,\u201d Cyrus remembers. \u201cI had him on such a high pedestal because I was such a fan.\u201d\n\nCyrus went on to play a small-town doctor who moves to the big city in the Pax network series \u201cDoc,\u201d which ran for 88 episodes. In 2005, he was cast as Robby Stewart in \u201cHannah Montana,\u201d opposite a tweenage Miley, who played a pop star undercover as an ordinary girl.\n\nThe series launched his daughter into orbit and gave Cyrus a new public identity: Miley\u2019s dad. (Five days before this interview, Miley and husband Liam Hemsworth announced their separation; Cyrus doesn\u2019t talk much about Miley.)\n\nWorking together drew father and daughter closer, even if the circumstances were unnatural. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously incredibly unusual for a tweenage girl to work full time with her own dad,\u201d says Disney Channel President Gary Marsh. \u201cIt\u2019s even more unusual for a dad to work with his own daughter, as a colleague. As far as I could tell, they were the same dynamics I see now with my own 13-year-old daughter.\u201d\n\n\u201cHannah Montana\u201d upended life for the Cyrus family, who were soon followed everywhere by paparazzi. \u201cThe good news is, I like people,\u201d Cyrus says. \u201cI fear more the day that nobody gives a s---. I think that\u2019s a scarier reality, going out somewhere and nobody even caring.\u201d\n\n\n\n(Nathan Morgan/For The Washington Post)\n\nCyrus was more famous than he\u2019d been in years, but his music career was flagging. During the 2000s and much of the \u201910s, he tried everything: Patriotic albums. Christian albums. Heavy metal. \u201cDancing With the Stars.\u201d He ditched Billy Ray and renamed himself Cyrus. He even grew his mullet back, hoping that audiences shared his nostalgia for that iconic, long-ago hairstyle. (They did not.)\n\nBy the time he and Von Tress finished work on \u201cThe SnakeDoctor Circus,\u201d a concept album about the American condition that emphasized topical concerns such as opioid addiction, Cyrus thought he might never write another song. When \u201cSnakeDoctor\u201d was released in May, he says, \u201cI figured that was probably it for me.\u201d\n\nBut now Cyrus is enjoying his third foray into pop cultural relevancy in as many decades. He\u2019s very famous again, but it\u2019s an odd kind of fame: It\u2019s his, but not his. He\u2019s Hannah Montana\u2019s dad, Lil Nas X\u2019s sidekick. For Cyrus, celebrity has seldom directly translated into record sales. \u201cSnakeDoctor\u201d did not chart, even at the fevered height of \u201cOld Town Road\u201d summer.\n\nHis success this go-round might be proximal, but it\u2019s also easier to handle. After decades in which he worked himself to exhaustion onstage and on sets, straining his marriage and missing large portions of his kids\u2019 childhoods, he can now do exactly as he pleases. He enjoys collaborations with younger artists and recently released the country-rock throwback song \u201cChevys and Fords,\u201d a collaboration with singer Johnny McGuire. He has begun writing songs again. \u201cI may just have peace of mind for the first time ever,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like I can just lay my burden down.\u201d\n\nThe one word Cyrus repeatedly uses to describe his life after \u201cOld Town Road\u201d is \u201cmagical.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just a beautiful, magical story that I look back on and I go, \u2018I can\u2019t imagine my life now without it,\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cI never dreamed another one would come back around. I would\u2019ve been fine. But now, looking back on it, this was my story.\u201d", "description": "After the summer of \u201cOld Town Road,\u201d the \u201cHannah Montana\u201d star and \u201cAchy Breaky Heart\u201d hitmaker is responsible for three major pop culture moments.", "authors": ["Allison Stewart", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ffv637GZw63k2SKtVNeS4ashmAg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CZJ222GCUAI6TC7XZXRNTYEQKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
