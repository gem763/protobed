But the exchange denied this through its official Twitter profile on October 2, 2019, and informed investors that Atlas Quantum leaves no value stuck on the platform. HitBTC further stated that the video is fake, and that the Atlas team made no official request for assistance. At the same time, there are numerous investors who fear that the company will not be able to honor its liabilities to customers if they all request withdrawals. After the huge media coverage of the case, Atlas Quantum presented an audit report that allegedly attested to the amount of Bitcoins and stablecoins it has. But would it be sufficient to honor their commitments to the entire customer base?\"\n\nThe congressman also talks about the epidemic of cryptocurrency pyramid schemes in Brazil:\n\n\"The amount of fraud involving Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is frightening. We have opened a new page on our website for people who have had problems with pyramid schemes to report their cases, and we have received a huge number of reports and requests from people all over Brazil.\u201d\n\nThe document asking for the investigation was signed by 234 congressmen, which is 63 more than the minimum required to approve the investigation.\n\n\"We have received so many reports that the PCI will be a huge effort and will need a big task force. We ask anyone who\u2019s had a problem with cryptocurrency companies to go to my website: deputadoaureo.com.br and look for the proper tab to make your complaint about crypto pyramid schemes,\" the deputy said.", "description": "We got the congressional documents that explain why this is happening", "authors": ["Cassio Gusson"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvODA5ZDYwZTE0MmY2N2FmOWRjNTQ2MWMyZmYzZTYxMjkuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
