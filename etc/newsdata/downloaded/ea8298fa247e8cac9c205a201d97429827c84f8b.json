You're looking around at the way we play and his movements and you have to say he is the No 1.'\n\nThe Dutch former Tranmere Rovers goalkeeper looked at the case of Manchester United's David de Gea, who struggled initially at Old Trafford before establishing himself as the club's first choice, but he heaped praise on Alisson for making a quick impact at the club.\n\nAlisson dives during a penalty shootout as Liverpool lost to Man City in the Community Shield\n\nAchterberg has been at Liverpool since 2009 and has trained Simon Mignolet and Loris Karius\n\n'Looking at Premier League level, he has worked out this move himself with the qualities he has shown over the years,' he added.\n\n'Obviously these moves need to come off, because you look at David de Gea (at Manchester United), it took one or two years before he was at his level and had the trust.\n\n'So you don't have a lot of time to settle because the talking is there all the time and I think Ali and the boss have changed the way the crowd are really with the way they manage and play.\n\nThe Brazilian gets down to shield the ball in the Champions League Final against Tottenham\n\nHe has been sidelined this campaign after coming off against Norwich in the opening game\n\n'Now the crowd is positive from the first second and are not worried if the ball is in the air or the box.'\n\nAlisson has not played since Liverpool's opening game against Norwich, when he was forced off with a calf injury in the first half. Former West Ham goalkeeper Adrian has been deputising ever since.\n\nBut he is expected to return to play against rivals Manchester United after the international break on October 20. The 27-year-old is thought to have undertaken extra training sessions as he steps up his recovery.", "description": "The Merseyside outfit have been through a range of different stoppers in recent season, with Simon Mignolet and Loris Karius both making costly mistakes.", "authors": ["Oli Gamp For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/18/19503700-0-image-a-24_1570643262188.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
