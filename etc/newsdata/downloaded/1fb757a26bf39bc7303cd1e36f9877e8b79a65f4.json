But we have been sadly forced to conclude that under the present terms of business, our model simply does not work,\" she added.\n\nShe added the \"the drawn-out Brexit process\" had damaged sales.\n\n\"Without such a delay, it is feasible to believe that our issues would have been more manageable. Instead, it has only intensified the pressures,\" she said.\n\nMs Connolly said the firm had considered a refinancing or a rescue deal, known as a company voluntary agreement (CVA) with its landlords and lenders.\n\nThis is an insolvency process that allows a business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts and is often used as an opportunity to renegotiate rents.\n\nHowever, she said the firm had concluded that neither option would \"fundamentally change the core challenges facing the business\".\n\n\"We are sadly no longer in a position to demonstrate to our shareholders that the business can continue as a going concern,\" she added.\n\nThe struggling retailer warned earlier this year that trading had deteriorated.\n\nImage copyright John Wellings Image caption Philip Day started his career at clothing manufacturers Coats Viyella and Wensum\n\nUK billionaire and Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group owner Philip Day is the majority owner of the chain, with a 95% stake via his Dubai-based investment vehicle Spectre.\n\nSpectre said: \"We are disappointed with the result of our investment in Bonmarche, but our primary thought at this time is with the business' employees and families.\"\n\nAdministrator FRP Advisory said it had been appointed because the business was no longer able to meet its financial obligations.\n\nIt emphasised that trading would continue and no redundancies had been made.\n\n\"There is every sign that we can continue trading while we market Bonmarch\u00e9 for sale and believe that there will be interest to take on the business,\" it said.\n\nTough conditions\n\nBonmarch\u00e9 is the latest retailer to be hit by tough conditions amid growing competition from online retailers and higher operating costs, such as a rising minimum wage and business rates.\n\nIt has led to big names such as Toys R Us going into administration, while others such as Topshop-owner Arcadia, Debenhams and New Look have announced large-scale closures.", "description": "The chain's 318 shops will remain open while a buyer is sought for the business.", "authors": ["Katie Hope", "Business Reporter", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5121/production/_103596702_bonn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
