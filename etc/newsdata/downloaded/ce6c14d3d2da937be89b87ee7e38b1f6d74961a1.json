CHEAP!\n\nPhone upgrades are an odd one. There are very few thousand-dollar items that we\u2019d happily replace each year. Yet, here we are. Stuck in a loop. Buying the freshest and new devices every 12 months.\n\nBut, for the savvy amongst us, this upgrade cycle can be a wonderful thing. Just think about Google\u2018s Pixel 3 range.\n\nThese phones were only released last October, but the Pixel 4 devices are just round the corner. Now, this new release doesn\u2019t make the Pixel 3 a bad phone \u2014 quite the opposite in fact. It still has one of the best cameras on the market and a slick, refined operating system.\n\nWhat the upcoming release of the Pixel 4 has done though is push the price down on Google\u2018s earlier phones. It makes sense: there are most likely tens of thousands of handsets Google needs to shift ahead of its new devices hitting the streets.\n\nWhich is why we\u2019re recommending this wonderful deal on a 64GB Google Pixel 3XL. While the phone used to retail for $899, you can now pick it up from Amazon for only $551.06. That is a 39 percent saving, which amounts to $347.94 in actual money. Which, friends, is enough money to take a small weekend trip.\n\nBecause I\u2019m nice, here\u2019s a video about the Google Pixel 3 range:\n\n\n\nSo, why is it worth going for the Pixel 3? Well, if you\u2019re looking for a reliable phone with a great camera and an unrivaled version of Android, the 64GB Google Pixel 3XL is for you. While the 64GB of storage isn\u2019t a huge amount, Google will store all your photos on the cloud for free, so you can save a lot of space that way.\n\nSure, the Pixel 4 will probably have some cool new features, but is it worth paying double for the price for some elements of the phone you probably won\u2019t use? Well, that\u2019s up to you, I guess.\n\nAll I can say is that the 64GB Google Pixel 3XL is a rock solid phone that will still last you for a few years, and is totally worth a shout if you\u2019re looking for a bargain.\n\nInterested? You can pick up the 64GB Google Pixel 3XL for $551 dollars over at Amazon here. Enjoy!\n\nThis post includes affiliate links to products that you can buy online.
