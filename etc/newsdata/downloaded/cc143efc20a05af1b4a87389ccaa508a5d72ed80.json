Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) recently released the pictures of the moon's surface clicked by the Orbiter High Resolution Camera (OHRC) on the Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter.\n\nAccording to ISRO\u2019s website, \u2018the pictures were acquired at 04:30 IST on September 5, 2019 by the Orbiter from a height of 100 km from the moon surface. The images cover parts of the Boguslawsky E Crater, measuring about 14 km in diameter and 3 km depth and surroundings which lie in the Southern Polar region of the moon\u2019.\n\n#ISRO\n\nHave a look at the images taken by #Chandrayaan2's Orbiter High Resolution Camera (OHRC).\n\nFor more images please visit https://t.co/YBjRO1kTcL pic.twitter.com/K4INnWKbaM \u2014 ISRO (@isro) October 4, 2019\n\nOne can see boulders and small craters of the moon in the images.\n\n\u2018OHRC onboard Chandrayaan-2 provides very high spatial resolution images of the Moon. This operates in the visible Panchromatic band. With a spatial resolution of 25 cm from a 100 km orbit and a swath of 3 km, it provides the sharpest images ever from a lunar orbiter platform. OHRC is an important new tool for lunar topographic studies of select regions\u2019, the ISRO website reads.\n\nISRO\n\nDon't Miss 12.8 K SHARES 568 SHARES 5 K SHARES\n\nISRO is still regularly posting updates about the developments and finding of the Chandrayaan-2 and it is heartwarming to see that people are still as invested as they were during the launch.", "description": "Even though establishment of connection with Vikram lander seems like a lost cause now Chandrayaan-2 orbiter is still sending in useful data.
