After taking a walk up the mountain near his house, he found himself sitting in an open field in Marula Street in Beverly Hills, Kleinmond.\n\nIt was at that point that he encountered the young boys and asked them why they were not at school. Johnson swore at him in response, he said.\n\nRossouw said he grabbed the boy and threw him to the ground before strangling him and stabbing him in his neck, face and chest.\n\nBut he didn't stop there.\n\nRossouw used a rock to deliver a final, deadly blow the child's head, crushing his skull in the process.\n\nIn an attempt to cover up his crime, Rossouw dragged the boy's body away and hid it.\n\nHe was arrested later that day after eyewitnesses identified him.\n\nRossouw said he entered into the plea deal because he felt remorseful and, although he had smoked drugs earlier in the day, he admitted that he had acted with the \"full appreciation of the wrongfulness of his actions as he had the intention to kill the child\".\n\nProsecutor Liezel Scholzel told the court the deceased was only 9-years-old when Rossouw murdered him in a callous and vicious manner for no apparent reason.\n\n\"Crimes toward children, similar to these committed by the accused, are extremely prevalent, with Western Cape child murders ranking the highest in the country,\" she submitted.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
