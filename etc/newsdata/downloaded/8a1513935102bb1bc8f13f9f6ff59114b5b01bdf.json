The suit was filed Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into that element,\u201d Rosenhaus said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into my discussions with the Patriots or what may or may not have been discussed.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Patriots coach Bill Belichick told reporters that Brown was expected to practice with the team Wednesday, but declined to answer other questions about the receiver.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve looked into the situation. We\u2019re taken it very seriously all the way through the organization,\u201d Belichick said.\n\nHere\u2019s what Belichick said about Antonio Brown. To other questions, he said \u201cI\u2019m done with that\u201d and that he\u2019d give more information when he has it. Would not say if the team knew about the lawsuit before signing Brown. pic.twitter.com/vnSYRmavfe \u2014 Nora Princiotti (@NoraPrinciotti) September 11, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
