They ask when he first knew about Trump\u2019s call, whether he advised Trump on any matter related to the subsequent whistleblower complaint, and whether he was involved in any conversations about how to handle the complaint. They give Menashi an Oct. 7 deadline for his responses.\n\nHere\u2019s a copy of the letter:\n\nA White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment about Menashi\u2019s role in either of these matters.\n\nMenashi, 40, is already a contentious nominee. He\u2019s drawn strong opposition from progressive groups over his long record of opposing and undermining equality for communities of color, women and LGBTQ people. Protesters filled the hall outside his Senate confirmation hearing this month and got arrested for shouting \u201cTitle IX is on the line,\u201d a reference to Menashi serving as legal counsel to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos when she rolled back Title IX protections for survivors of sexual assault on campuses.\n\nBeyond that, Menashi doesn\u2019t have support from either of his New York home-state senators and he visibly angered Republicans and Democrats in his confirmation hearing by refusing to give any details on what he\u2019s worked on at the White House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m real doubtful\u201d about supporting him, Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), who is a member of the Judiciary Committee, told HuffPost last week. \u201cMy thought is, look, if he\u2019ll treat a United States senator the way he treated us, I wonder how he would treat the people.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has not responded to repeated requests for comment on how Menashi\u2019s nomination is looking.", "description": "Senate Democrats are asking judicial nominee Steven Menashi, a White House legal aide, what he's known about the bombshell whistleblower complaint.", "authors": ["Senior Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8e4db0220000e60153c5bb.jpeg?cache=kxlwnbnsbt&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
