This will mean a significant number of women in our society will be in a very vulnerable and precarious position and will be exposed to further risk of harm and exploitation from their abusers.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We fear that migrant women will be locked out of protection and access to justice because of the failure of government to ensure all women are adequately protected.\u201d\n\nThe campaigner, whose organisation supports black and minority ethnic (BME) women escaping gender-based violence and specialises in supporting women who have no access to public funds, also said the charity, which has been running for 40 years, could lose funding when Britain leaves the EU.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely worried that our funding will be cut because there is the possibility of huge funding constraints on support services for women overall as the public purse shrinks after Brexit,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will be bad for all women but especially BME women who have already suffered disproportionately from cuts to public services. We are very fearful of what the future holds for BME women. Equality not austerity or discrimination should lie at the heart of all government policies addressing violence against women and girls.\u201d\n\nAs refuges across the board have seen their funding decimated in recent years, those in need of a refuge to escape their abuser are already finding it harder than ever to find a free bed \u2013 with the most recent figures showing 60 per cent of them are unable to be housed, most commonly due to lack of space. Local authority spending on refuges has been cut from \u00a331.2m in 2010 to \u00a323.9m in 2017.\n\nSpecialist services for BME survivors have been hardest hit by the cuts \u2013 with funding moving towards generic service providers instead. Some 22 BME refuges across the country have had their funding cut or have been taken over by larger organisations in the past 12 years.\n\nGisela Valle, of the Latin American Women\u2019s Rights Service, said they are helping women apply for EU settlement scheme but are coming across many who do not think it is necessary for them to apply due to never having encountered issues around immigration before.\n\nShe said: \u201cThey don\u2019t understand that they need to apply. There is a lot of misinformation around the scheme. But domestic abuse survivors who do not apply for the settlement scheme will lose support from the government. The cornerstone of domestic abuse support is access to a refuge but if you do not have access to public funds, the refuges are not going to take you, because they cannot claim the money back. And if they cannot claim the expenses for housing these women and their children, it is likely they will be asked to leave.\n\n\u201cEU women are likely not to be aware that this could happen. There is a general lack of awareness of what the EU settlement scheme is or how it works. Women we work with say: \u2018I don\u2019t need to do this\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt is a worrying situation. There could be a large number of EU women or spouses of EU citizens who are not able to report domestic abuse for fear of deportation or of losing children due to concerns around police discovering their immigration status is not settled. Perpetrators already use domestic abuse survivors\u2019 immigration status as a weapon to abuse them but this could become worse after Brexit, and the number of women in this situation could increase.\u201d\n\nCampaigners have long warned migrant women who have endured domestic abuse are too fearful to report violence to the police or other services due to the risk of being detained or deported. While guidance is already in place for police forces to support domestic violence victims, they often share data with the Home Office. As a result, the victims can be treated as suspects by immigration officials. The government suggests some victims of domestic abuse \u201cmay be best served by returning to their country of origin and, where it is available, to the support of their family and friends\u201d.\n\nNicki Norman, of lead domestic abuse charity Women\u2019s Aid, raised concerns about the impact Brexit could have on EU citizens who have experienced domestic abuse.\n\n\u201cFor EU citizens in the UK, access to vital domestic abuse support services may be restricted, which is a serious concern and must be addressed,\u201d she said.\n\nThe latest warnings come amid concerns over the EU settlement scheme after it emerged only around one million EU nationals resident in the UK have applied for settled status and at least a further 2.6 million have not yet applied.\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cEU citizens who are victims of domestic violence are not going to be refused help if they haven\u2019t applied to the EU Settlement Scheme by the end of 2020, but we encourage all EU citizens to apply as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWhere someone has reasonable grounds for not having applied by the deadline, such as if they were involved in an abusive relationship, they will be offered more time and support to make an application. We are providing up to \u00a39m in grant funding for community organisations, including those who support victims of domestic abuse, to ensure they receive additional help if needed.\u201d", "description": "Thousands of domestic abuse victims\u00a0who are European nationals could be kicked out of refuges\u00a0or blocked from even entering them after\u00a0Brexit\u00a0because they do not know they have to apply for settled status, campaigners have warned.", "authors": ["Maya Oppenheim"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/12/18/domestic-abuse.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
