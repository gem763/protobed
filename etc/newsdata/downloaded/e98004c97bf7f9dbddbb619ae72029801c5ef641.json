The PM has reportedly met the leader of the opposition Labour Party, taking Jeremy Corbyn up on his offer for talks to come up with a mutually agreeable timetable for completing Brexit legislation No agreement so far. MPs voted down Johnson\u2019s fast-track programme for spiriting the deal into law last night, putting the \u201cgreat advance\u201d (according to the PM) at risk, as a slower pace of discussion in Parliament will almost certainly see it amended, possibly causing various factions who supported it to drop away\n\nChip stocks are under renewed pressure and weighing on global markets after Texas Instruments\u2019 became the biggest upset of the earnings season so far. TXN (NASDAQ: ) has competition from Caterpillar Inc (NYSE: ). expectations and cut earnings and revenue guidance sending its shares sharply lower. The giant stocks are particularly weighing on ahead of Wall Street\u2019s open. In other hotly anticipated earnings, Boeing's (NYSE: ) appeared to miss estimates sharply again as it continues to deal with the fallout from the fatal 737 MAX debacle\n\nInc (NYSE: ). expectations and cut earnings and revenue guidance sending its shares sharply lower.

In other hotly anticipated earnings, Boeing's (NYSE: ) appeared to miss estimates sharply again as it continues to deal with the fallout from the fatal 737 MAX debacle China signalled it may replace the leader of Hong Kong after months of violent protests, whilst the extradition bill that triggered them has now been formally withdrawn\n\nOne assist for equity sentiment: U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has broken the ice over Washington\u2019s lower-intensity trade conflict, with Europe, indicating the White House might favour talks instead of immediately moving to long-feared tariffs on automobile imports\n\nAnother assist (sort of): OPEC is considering whether to reduce production further to stave off the impact of falling demand. remains weak for now though. The weekly tally from the U.S.\u2019s key oil industry body points to a bigger than forecast inventory build (up 4.5 million barrels vs. a 2.2-million-barrel rise expected) when official are released later\n\nStocks/sectors on the move\n\nAfter a volatile initial reaction, Boeing (NYSE: ) shares turned about 1% higher as the U.S. cash session approached. Q3 results were unmistakeably dire, including a second straight quarter of negative free cash flow, and reduced production schedules across models including the 737 MAX and 787. However, Boeing raised its 737 MAX output forecast by 36%. And, after an additional $900m in costs for the faulty aircraft, no further significant compensation expenses are envisaged. Less plausibly, Boeing stuck to a Q4 timeline for the resumption of 737 MAX flights. Still, with the stock down 20% already, this year, deeper downside was always going to be minimal from here\n\nshares turned about 1% higher as the U.S. cash session approached.

Caterpillar (NYSE: ) shares fell as much as 6.5% after the world\u2019s biggest construction machinery maker missed earnings and revenue forecasts and cut forecasts of both again for this financial year. Whilst lowered guidance had been widely pencilled in, the scale of the cuts looks to have taken investors off guard. The midpoint of CAT\u2019s new 2019 EPS forecast is $10.84 compared with a $12.25 midpoint previously\n\nshares fell as much as 6.5% after the world\u2019s biggest construction machinery maker missed earnings and revenue forecasts and cut forecasts of both again for this financial year.

EU financials/banks are also soft, possibly with an eye to Thursday\u2019s ECB statement, the last steered by Mario Draghi.
