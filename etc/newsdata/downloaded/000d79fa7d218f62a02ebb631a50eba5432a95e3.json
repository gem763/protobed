Now prison authorities in California say the population is made up mostly of black and Latin men and women. In my 2018 piece for NPR's All Things Considered, I noted there there were Los Tigres fans both among the inmates and the prison administration. Los Tigres del Norte at Folsom Prison, a new Netflix documentary that chronicles the concert, features inmates talking about the band's influence on their lives before and after being incarcerated.\n\nIn the same way Cash became known as a voice for the marginalized after the concert was released, Los Tigres del Norte became la voz del pueblo (the voice of the people) as they chronicled the joys and challenges of immigrant life here in the U.S. The band members told me they wanted to pay their respects to one of their idols as well as remind the inmates that they are not forgotten. Their sincerity is visible every time they are on camera: greeting inmates inside Folsom's Greystone Chapel, looking out over the prison yard as inmates sing along or gazing into their own memories of the life outside.\n\nThe concert and its documentary show the power of music to heal as well as the power of regret and redemption. It's a lesson in doing the right thing, for the right reason, by Los Tigres del Norte, one of the most popular bands on either side of the border.", "description": "Los Tigres del Norte at Folsom Prison, a new Netflix documentary, shows the power of music to heal.", "authors": ["Felix Contreras"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/18/los-tgres-folsom-ltdn-fp-tower-photo_los_tigres_1_320_pix2-jr-smaller_wide-263df9da24397d668b5399efb1b1c1fd6d403810.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
