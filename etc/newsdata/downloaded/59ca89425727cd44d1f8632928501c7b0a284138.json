Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsBlack lawmakers condemn Trump's 'lynching' remarks The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - Trump's impeachment plea to Republicans Diplomat who raised Ukraine concerns to testify in Trump impeachment probe MORE (D-Md.), who died last week at age 68 and will lie in state in the Capitol on Thursday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSpeier\u2019s official entry into the race pits her against acting Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney Carolyn Bosher MaloneyHouse passes bill taking aim at anonymous shell companies An unintended burden on small businesses House Republicans 'demand the release of the rules' on impeachment MORE (D-N.Y.), who is now the most senior Democrat on the panel and seeking the job permanently.\n\nSpeier is much lower on the seniority ladder but she said she has served on the committee since she got elected in 2008. She also serves on a second committee involved in the month-old impeachment probe, the Intelligence panel.\n\nOther Oversight Committee members interested in the job include Reps.

She is most well-known for surviving five gunshot wounds during the 1978 assassination of her boss, then-Rep Leo Ryan (D-Calif.), during the Jonestown massacre in Guyana.\n\nThirty years later, she won his old congressional seat.\n\nIn a brief interview outside the Capitol, Speier said she personally informed both Pelosi and Maloney of her decision to run to lead Oversight.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re good friends,\u201d Speier said of Maloney.\n\nThe Washington Post earlier this week reported that Speier was running for the Oversight gavel, citing anonymous sources.\n\nSome Democrats have been hoping to avoid a heated, contested race for the Oversight gavel, warning that it would be a distraction during a crucial stretch of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. These Democrats believe Maloney, 73, should keep the job \u2014 at least through the 2020 cycle.\n\nIf Pelosi tells the 234-member Democratic Caucus she doesn\u2019t want a messy fight for the gavel, Speier said she will back off. But so far, Pelosi has not weighed in, in deference to Cummings. A memorial service for the late chairman will be held in Statuary Hall on Thursday; a funeral service will be held Friday in his native Baltimore.\n\n\u201cI think I would leave that in the hands of the Speaker to make that decision,\u201d Speier said in the interview. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to the Speaker and she is not doing anything until after the funerals\u201d for Cummings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to respect the Speaker. If she says \u2018No race,\u2019 then there won\u2019t be a race,\u201d Speier added. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t said that and she\u2019s not going say anything until [later].\u201d\n\nDespite her entry into the race, Speier said she has not been actively campaigning for the job: \u201cWe need to celebrate an incredible leader right now.\u201d\n\nConnolly, 69, said it's too early to have the gavel conversation, with the memorials to Cummings not yet passed. But he left open the idea of seeking the chairmanship afterwards.\n\nUnder caucus rules, Democrats have 30 days to decide how to permanently replace Cummings.\n\n\u201cObviously, I'd be interested, but that's a different question than, 'What are you going to do?'\u201d Connolly said. \u201cRight now I'm focused on doing my job and getting ready for Elijah's lying in state and the funeral.\"\n\nMike Lillis contributed.", "description": "Rep.
