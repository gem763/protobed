We\u2019re not talking about a swing state that is being forced to take tough votes.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will be a powerful voice for upholding Roe v. Wade at a disturbing moment in our history when a woman\u2019s right to control her own body and future is at stake,\u201d said Sanders in his endorsement.\n\nNewman, a supporter of abortion rights, narrowly lost last year when she first challenged the pro-life Lipinski for his seat representing Illinois\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, a position he has held since 2005.\n\n\u201cI think the party really hurts itself tremendously by suggesting that it\u2019s not open to people who are pro-life, pro-life voters,\u201d Lipinski told National Review at the March for Life earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI also know that there are a lot of people who come up to me all the time and tell me that they are pro-life,\u201d Lipinski added, noting that some are his own constituents. \u201cThey want to be a Democrat but they don\u2019t feel that the party is accepting of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible for the party,\u201d he continued. \u201cThese people feel like they have been pushed out of the party.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it happens again another primary, I\u2019m ready for that,\u201d he said in January of the possibility another tough primary challenge.\n\n\u201cHe clearly just doesn\u2019t like equality, period\u201d and doesn\u2019t understand \u201ceveryday basics,\u201d Newman said of her opponent.\n\nNewman supports Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s signature issue, the Green New Deal, as well as Medicare for All, one of Sanders\u2019s priorities. Lipinksi voted against the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Tuesday endorsed the primary challenger of one of the most pro-life Democrats in Congress, Chicago-area congressman Dan Lipinski.The young progressive from New York awarded her first House endorsement of the 2020 elections to Marie Newman, who also enjoys the", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gNkF2__bVqeN5lRZmux1Tw--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/a52c7446adee017c7e9288bdf3ee10a2", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
