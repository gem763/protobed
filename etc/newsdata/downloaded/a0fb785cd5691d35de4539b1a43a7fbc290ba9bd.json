You\u2019re a woman \u2014 the only woman \u2014 working in the Los Angeles Wholesale Produce Market, a frenzied hive of testosterone-fueled buying and selling of tomatoes, lettuce and onions operating in predawn downtown darkness. You\u2019re presented with a fuzzy brown fruit from New Zealand called a Chinese gooseberry. In fact, not just one of them, but 200 cases of them.\n\nHow do you sell a fruit that Americans have never tasted, let alone heard of \u2014 not to mention the first commercial fruit being introduced to the United States since the banana in the 1880s? If you\u2019re Frieda Caplan, you call the growers in New Zealand and say, \u201cWe need to change the name of this fruit. How about \u2018kiwifruit\u2019?\u201d Then you ask a pastry chef friend to slice some of this bright green fruit on the top of a custard tart so that you can convince supermarket produce buyers to just give it a taste.\n\n\u201cThe kiwifruit was so unique looking, and retailers were always looking for ways to stand out from their competition,\u201d Caplan recalls. \u201cI worked with the buyer of Alpha Beta Markets in the beginning, and they offered kiwifruit for 10 cents each all summer long. They didn\u2019t make money, I didn\u2019t make money, but it allowed them to make a statement to their shoppers.\u201d\n\nAt Frieda\u2019s Specialty Produce, they jokingly refer to kiwifruit as their \u201c18-year overnight success,\u201d because that\u2019s about how long it took for the odd-looking fruit to take off and become a common ingredient in smoothies, fruit bowls and desserts across the country. They think it was worth the wait.\n\n\u201cCan you even imagine a world now without kiwifruit?\u201d says Karen Caplan, Frieda\u2019s daughter, now president and chief executive of the family business.\n\n\n\nFrieda Caplan receives a shipment of New Zealand kiwifruit to the United States in 1964. (Frieda\u2019s Specialty Produce)\n\nAt 96, Frieda no longer goes into the office every day but still works from home, while Karen and Frieda\u2019s other daughter, Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Jackie Caplan Wiggins, run the daily operations, shipping a host of produce to grocery stores across the country. Alex Berkley, Karen\u2019s daughter, joined the company in 2011, the third generation of women in the family to devote her life to bringing \u201cexotic\u201d fruits and vegetables to the American table. In recent years, the focus has been on jackfruit, Meyer lemons and shishito peppers, a few of the 400 products championed by Frieda\u2019s, where they have been not just ahead of the trends, but actually setting them, for 57 years.\n\nClad in high heels and a pencil skirt, Frieda Caplan was already an anomaly in the male-dominated produce wholesale markets of the 1950s, a job that came about simply because she needed to find part-time work while she was still breast-feeding her infant daughter Karen; the odd hours of the industry, with much of the work starting in the wee hours of the morning, provided the flexibility she wanted.\n\nEventually, Caplan struck out on her own, building a thriving business where other women could come get a job: \u201cNo one hired women in sales back then,\u201d she says in a phone interview. When she was later honored with the \u201cProduce Man of the Year\u201d award in 1979 by the Packer, a produce industry publication, she simply handed it back.\n\n\u201cI was so surprised when they called out my name as the awardee,\u201d Caplan says, \u201cbut I was a woman! How could they call it Produce Man of the Year?\u201d She was happy to accept the award later when it was renamed Produce Marketer of the Year.\n\nThe recognition was well-deserved. It was Caplan\u2019s innate talent as an enthusiastic storyteller that made all the difference with harried supermarket produce buyers in search of stock.\n\n\n\nClockwise from top left: Sugar snap peas, kumquats, sunchokes, purple sweet potatoes, dragonfruit, mini-pineapples, hibiscus, pearl onions, Meyer lemons, passion fruit, radicchio and jackfruit from Frieda\u2019s Specialty Produce. (Stacy Zarin Goldberg for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cFrieda endeared herself to the produce industry at large by telling a story with each item, and that has become their company\u2019s trademark,\u201d says Richard McKellogg, director of produce merchandising for Lowes Foods in Winston-Salem, N.C. \u201cShoppers are maneuvering the aisles with hundreds of choices. Frieda\u2019s tells the story and provides the information to the retailers with a level of detail and knowledge that I could never personally keep up with myself. They took uncommon items \u2014 spaghetti squash, sugar snap peas \u2014 and made them common.\u201d\n\nSometimes it was as simple as slapping a sticker onto that spaghetti squash that explained how to cook it, a surprisingly revolutionary idea at the time. If you\u2019ve ever wondered why you often find wonton wrappers, tofu and bok choy grouped together in the produce department, that\u2019s a result of a retailer who asked Frieda to come up with a way to showcase fresh Asian vegetables as part of a complete meal.\n\nWhen food writer Marian Burros called Frieda in 1979 to find out what was new on the horizon, Burros ended up writing a story for The Washington Post about an exciting new cross between the English pea and snow pea: the sugar snap pea.\n\n\u201cPeople are calling it the greatest new vegetable in 50 years,\u201d wrote Burros, \u201cand the first shipment is scheduled to arrive in Washington before the weekend.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis article comes out about this new vegetable,\u201d Karen recalls, \u201cand suddenly everyone\u2019s showing up at the A&P grocery store clamoring for it. The buyer called my mom and said, \u2018Frieda, why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u2019 Of course, my mom knew from the moment she ate her first sugar snap pea that they were going to be the next big thing, she just needed to get the retailers to buy in. But today, everything has shifted in terms of consumer demand, and a retailer would never think of not having something in stock that was being written about in the press.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom left, sales manager Alex Berkley; her mother, chief executive Karen Caplan; and Karen\u2019s sister, Vice President Jackie Caplan Wiggins. (Darcy Mask/Frieda\u2019s Specialty Produce)\n\nWhile Frieda\u2019s might be known as a trendsetter, the company has learned that trendiness isn\u2019t enough. In the produce industry, a long shelf life is critical to success, too. (One hard lesson: Pre-peeled kiwifruit is not a good idea.) It\u2019s not surprising the lengthy list of Frieda\u2019s products, from jicama to sunchokes to the kiwifruit that started it all, includes items that can be stored well for weeks or months at a time, helping to protect the bottom line.\n\n\u201cSelling something perishable is pretty terrifying,\u201d says Berkley, the company\u2019s sales manager. \u201cWhat motivates us is making a difference every day in how people eat.\u201d\n\nThat motivation spurred Frieda\u2019s to partner with A.V. Thomas Produce when the California family farm acquired the patent for the Stokes purple sweet potato in 2012. Knowing Frieda\u2019s company color was purple \u2014 a result of a sign painter creating a more \u201cfeminine\u201d sign for the company back when it was still housed at the Los Angeles Wholesale Produce Market \u2014 the farm\u2019s retail sales specialist, Jeremy Fookes, reached out to see if Frieda\u2019s might be interested in getting their colorful, and highly nutritious, potato out to retailers.\n\n\u201cIt was one phone call, we set up a meeting, they tested it out in the kitchen and fell in love with it,\u201d Fookes says. \u201cThey came up with a great marketing concept, \u2018Power Up With Purple,\u2019 and we went from a few acres to 500 acres in just a few years.\u201d After developing some 34 recipes for the Stokes variety, including a pretty stunning deep purple sweet potato pie dolloped with maple whipped cream, it\u2019s fair to say that Frieda\u2019s is a fan.\n\n\u201cQuality and flavor are super important to us,\u201d Karen says. \u201cMy mom doesn\u2019t cook, but she knows what tastes good. Back in the really early days, when I used to help out in the office, we\u2019d get 300 or 400 letters a week from people asking for recipes. That\u2019s when I started cooking, so we could send something back to them.\u201d Recipe development is now a key part of Frieda\u2019s marketing.\n\nFor Southern Californians shopping at Ralph\u2019s, those recipes are on full display at the annual Hatch chile grilling events staged at stores throughout the chain each August. The zesty chile, which grows in a valley near Hatch, N.M., has a short growing season that has made it prized among pepper connoisseurs; Frieda\u2019s recipes include a sizzling Hatch and chicken fajita, a vegan Hatch queso dip, and even a Hatch-infused margarita.\n\n\u201cPeople line up to get their Hatch chiles,\u201d says Brian Balladares, Ralph\u2019s division produce floral merchandiser, \u201cand, of course, we love to have customers excited about it. But, even more than that, Frieda\u2019s hosts a kickoff meeting with all of our produce associates to educate them and provide samples so they can get excited about it. Getting the buy-in from our associates is the most important part, and that\u2019s what they understand at Frieda\u2019s. We have to love the product as much as they do if we\u2019re going to sell it to our customers.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s all about loving the product, because, Karen says, \u201cAnything could be the next kiwi.\u201d\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nHow to pick, prep and cook leafy greens \u2014 a nutritional (and delicious) powerhouse\n\nGrab a spoon.
