It\u2019s time to lift each other up, not to push each other away. We only win when we are together,\u201d he wrote.\n\nXhaka\u2019s outburst came with director Josh Kroenke in attendance, as at least three former Arsenal captains \u2013 Pat Rice, David O\u2019Leary and Thierry Henry \u2013 also watched on from the stands.\n\nIan Wright, who scored 185 goals during his time with the club, fumed at Xhaka\u2019s behaviour.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the captain,\u201d he said on Match of the Day 2.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got the responsibility of being able to take that on board because he\u2019s been voted in. You can\u2019t go like that.\n\n\u201cThe amount of stick someone like Mesut Ozil has got I could understand if (he) throws his shirt down.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the captain, the manager has got faith in him. He should be apologising, he should have apologised already.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the guy they\u2019ve chosen as captain and that\u2019s not captain\u2019s behaviour. Arsenal fans have shown a lot of patience with him and the performances he has put in. He owes them a lot more than that.\u201d\n\nOn a combustible afternoon in north London, Emery also took more flak as his side gave up a two-goal lead to be held to a draw.\n\nArsenal were two goals ahead inside the opening 10 minutes as defenders Sokratis Papastathopoulos and David Luiz struck just 106 seconds apart.\n\nBut Palace fought back for a share of the spoils as Luka Milivojevic converted a VAR-awarded penalty before Jordan Ayew\u2019s second-half header saw the Eagles draw level.\n\nSokratis thought he had won it for the hosts late on, only for his effort to be chalked off by VAR after a foul in the build-up.\n\nThe result means Arsenal have won just two of their last eight Premier League games, with Emery\u2019s side sitting fifth in the table.", "description": "Hector Bellerin has called for unity at Arsenal\u00a0after captain Granit Xhaka swore at supporters during Sunday\u2019s Premier League draw with Crystal Palace.
