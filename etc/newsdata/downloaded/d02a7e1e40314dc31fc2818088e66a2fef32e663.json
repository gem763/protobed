Investing.com \u2013 Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Monday took a trip down memory lane, recounting the important role that former Fed Chairman Marriner Eccles played in paving the way for an independent central bank. \"Perhaps most importantly from my perspective as Fed Chair, (Marrinner) is responsible more than any other person for the fact that the United States today has an independent central bank \u2013 a central bank able to make decisions in the long-term best interest of the economy, without regard to the political pressures of the moment,\" Powell said in a speech at the premiere of KUED's documentary \"Marriner Eccles: Father of the Modern Federal Reserve.\" When FDR nominated Marriner to lead the Fed Board in 1934, he accepted on the condition that Roosevelt support a restructuring of the Fed to significantly strengthen the structural independence of the central bank. Powell\u2019s remarks come after a wave of criticism from President Donald Trump, who has urged the U.S. central bank to adopt more aggressive easing measures.\n\nNewsBreak: Powell Reiterates Importance of Independent Fed", "description": "NewsBreak: Powell Reiterates Importance of Independent Fed", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE5D00P_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
