A member of the ginger family, this brilliant yellow-orange spice is used frequently to make curry\u2014a staple in Indian and other Asian cuisines.\n\nBut turmeric is far more than a culinary staple; it\u2019s a centuries-old medicine too. One of its most active components\u2014curcumin\u2014has an amazing, centuries-old reputation in Ayurvedic medicine as a powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. Only over the past decade or so has Western medicine finally started to recognize and appreciate what ancient healers knew all those years ago.\n\nIn recent years, turmeric and curcumin have both been studied for their potential to prevent and fight chronic health problems like diabetes, arthritis, Alzheimer\u2019s, cardiovascular disease, depression, various gastrointestinal conditions, and even cancer.\n\nEven better, aside from very, mild stomach upset, turmeric and curcumin do not cause any significant side effects.\n\nSo, it\u2019s no surprise that we\u2019ve started seeing turmeric and curcumin added to everything from teas and lattes to juices and kombucha\u2014even chocolates and candies touting remarkable health-fueling benefits.\n\nBut chances are, you\u2019re getting duped\u2026\n\nPoor Bioavailability\n\nFor all these spectacular benefits, though, turmeric and curcumin do have one major drawback: notoriously low bioavailability. This term simply refers to the degree to which the nutrient is absorbed and used by your body. The higher the bioavailability, the better. It means that more of that particular nutrient can enter your bloodstream and work its magic.\n\nUnfortunately, turmeric is not one of those substances. As a result, you may be eating lots of turmeric or using products that contain turmeric/curcumin, thinking you\u2019re doing yourself (and your health) a favor\u2014but in reality, you\u2019re not doing much of anything.\n\nIt\u2019s important to know this so that you are not wasting your money on inferior products, and so that you\u2019re getting the most bang for your buck when you buy a turmeric/curcumin supplement or product.\n\nAll this is not to say that you shouldn\u2019t eat foods or drink beverages (tea, kombucha, etc.) that contain turmeric. Go ahead and add this colorful, delicious spice to your diet as much as you like. Every little bit helps and it certainly isn\u2019t going to hurt you.\n\nBut if you\u2019re buying cases upon cases of turmeric-enriched beverages or eating massive amounts of curry hoping you\u2019ll see some kind of benefit, you\u2019ll probably be disappointed. For serious therapeutic effects, you would have to consume A LOT of it\u2026so much that you would very quickly grow sick of it.\n\nGet My FREE Joint Pain Report The Drug-Free Joint Cure\n\nThere are roughly 200 mg of curcumin in one teaspoon of fresh or ground turmeric, and you need 1,000\u20131,500 mg daily if you want to reap any of curcumin\u2019s health benefits. For this reason alone, the most powerful benefits can only be achieved through supplementation.\n\nSpeaking of supplementation, here\u2019s another thing you should know\u2026\n\nOrdinary Curcumin Just Won\u2019t Do\n\nThere are SO many curcumin supplements on the market. Some boast \u201cpure curcumin\u201d as though it\u2019s something special. But, as you just learned, your body can\u2019t absorb pure curcumin (or turmeric). Some manufacturers include additional substances in their formulations to enhance bioavailability.\n\nOne such substance is piperine, a black pepper extract and the compound responsible for making black pepper so pungent. While piperine does work to improve bioavailability, it also contributes to indigestion in some people. So be aware of that if you\u2019re prone to indigestion.\n\nThere are also manufacturers that create curcumin products with proprietary delivery systems to enhance bioavailability. One of the more well-known brands is Meriva\u00ae, which discovered how to attach plant extracts to phospholipids to deliver a product that is 29 times more bioavailable than ordinary curcumin.\n\nAnother is Cavacurmin\u00ae, which binds curcumin to cyclodextrins\u2014natural sugars that have the ability to blend together oil and water. In the case of curcumin, cyclodextrins improve its solubility in water\u2026which increases absorption substantially.\n\nOne study showed that Cavacurmin\u00ae was more than 40 times more efficiently absorbed than other curcumin supplements and pure curcumin powder. Additionally, curcumin uptake in those taking Cavacurmin\u00ae was at least 4.6 times higher than the next-best commercial curcumin formulation.1\n\nSo the moral here is this: If you\u2019re going to spend your money on a supplement with such important and wide-ranging benefits as curcumin, you want it to work.\n\nIf you\u2019re hoping to relieve your joint pain, reduce general inflammation, improve your cardiovascular health or just add another layer of protection against some of today\u2019s most challenging inflammatory diseases, make sure you choose higher quality brands that contain one of the proprietary curcumin formulations I\u2019ve mentioned. If more of the compound can be absorbed and utilized by your body, you\u2019ll see and feel benefits faster and far more efficiently.\n\nYou can find products that contain Cavacurmin\u00ae or Meriva\u00ae online and at most health food stores. Read the label carefully to make sure you see these specific names in the ingredient list.\n\nThe typical daily dosage is 500 mg two or three times a day.\n\nReference\n\nPurpura M, et al.
