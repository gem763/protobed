Scotland were hungry\n\nIn a must-win match, Scotland wasted no time imposing themselves on Samoa. The tempo in which Scotland started the game was demonstrated through Darcy Graham\u2019s early break down the right which took the Scots deep into Samoa territory.\n\nAlthough they only had three points for the opening half-hour, the pressure eventually told and the floodgates opened with Sean Maitland\u2019s try.\n\n2. Variety paid dividends\n\nFinn Russell\u2019s performance with both ball in hand and boot to ball, was Scotland\u2019s greatest asset against Samoa.\n\nAlways thinking one step ahead, Russell kept the game flowing with offloads early on before opening the game up with his kicks, one of which went cross-field for Maitland to gather and dot down.\n\nStuart Hogg added to this with great kicking play near the break which propelled Scotland back into the Samoa half before he drove a drop goal through the posts from range.\n\n3. Samoa not clinical enough\n\nSamoa looked a shadow of the side which dispatched Russia 34-9 in their opening World Cup game.\n\nScotland gained control of the game fairly easily and kept Samoa in a stranglehold throughout the match. Against Russia, Steve Jackson\u2019s side looked energetic and inventive but the same couldn\u2019t be said against the Scots who dominated at the set piece and in open play.\n\nSamoa began the second half relatively well, forcing their way into the Scottish 22 but couldn\u2019t capitalise. They put together encouraging passing moves but handling errors haunted them throughout the game. That wasn\u2019t solely a Samoa issue, however, as Scotland also had their fair share of dropped passes.\n\n4. Game management was key\n\nAlthough Scotland shutout Samoa, they were very disciplined in their approach. When the scoreboard wasn\u2019t ticking over frequently in the first-half, they didn\u2019t panic and when Samoa were down to 14 men, they didn\u2019t lose their composure.\n\nIn the first half, Gregor Townsend\u2019s side set camp in the Samoa\u2019s 22 and ground their defence down, slowly but surely before changing the dynamic of their attack once the defence had settled. In the second half, their control came more from their scrums and lineouts as a tired Samoa side struggled to maintain their standards with the game going on.\n\n5. Samoa\u2019s ill-discipline costs them again\n\nAfter Rey Lee-Lo and Motu Matu\u2019u were handed a three-match bans for their high tackles against Russia, Samoa\u2019s ill-discipline hurt them again against Scotland. Wing Ed Fidow saw red as the game drew to a close as he conceded his second penalty try and received second yellow card of the game.\n\nFidow\u2019s first caution followed him illegally entering a try-bound maul before he attempted to knock Maitland into touch with his knees to stop him from scoring Scotland\u2019s bonus-point try.\n\nIf Samoa are to beat either Japan or Ireland they will need to keep their discipline.", "description": "Scotland\u00a0got their World Cup\u00a0campaign back on track with a comfortable 34-0 win over Samoa.
