But at 5am he had suffered heart failure.\n\n(Image: Tom Wren / SWNS)\n\n(Image: Emma Labuschagne / SWNS)\n\n\"Words cannot begin to describe the pain we felt in that moment.\n\n\"We watched our baby breathless, gasping for air while his heart stopped and paramedics worked to save his life.\n\n\"In that moment I did not think Michael would make it through.\n\n\"Yet I am so so blessed to be here telling you that he survived. He survived an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest which only seven per cent patients do.\"\n\nMichael was fitted with a pacemaker after waking up from the coma, which unfortunately restricts the tot's movement.\n\nCurrently, he is unable to sit up or support his own head.\n\nShop worker Emma said: \"It does hold him back. It's as big as the size of the palm of my hand and it has sharp edges.\n\n\"Putting that inside a baby is quite uncomfortable for them. But he is amazing, you wouldn't know looking at him that he is fighting this.\n\n\"He's a lovely little baby - it's hard to believe he's going through what he is. He's a miracle.\"\n\n(Image: Tom Wren / SWNS)\n\n(Image: Tom Wren / SWNS)\n\nMichael is also having technical problems with his pace maker.\n\nThe sensing lead is struggling to read Michael's heart rate which means it is completely unreliable and potentially will not work.\n\nEmma added: \"Every day is an unknown, until we can get his fibroma removed.\"\n\nThe mum has now set up a GoFundMe page to try and raise money for Michael's surgery.\n\nShe said: \"Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, ranked number one paediatric hospital in the world, has quoted us $147,000 which converts to approximately \u00a3116,000 for the procedure and we will need to pay for flights and accommodation\n\n\"The cardiac surgeons at Boston are the best cardiac surgeons in the world and they have done this operation several times.\n\n\"They are confident that they can drastically improve, or even cure, his condition by resecting the tumour.\n\n\"They want to operate within six months as his heart will be a good size. The fundraiser is doing really well so far, but it's still quite early days.\"\n\nYou can donate to Michael's fund here .", "description": "Little Michael Labuschagne was rushed to hospital seven months ago when he woke up gasping for air after suffering a cardiac arrest", "authors": ["Emma Grimshaw", "Jonathan Coles", "Andy Rudd", "Image", "Bristol Live", "Tom Wren", "Swns", "Emma Labuschagne"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20714127.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Mic.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
