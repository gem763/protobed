When travelling, I\u2019ll often hide the bottles after showering, just to make sure they get replenished each day. This means I go home with many tiny bottles of shampoo, conditioner and body wash, where they sit in a basket, usually unused. But now I know that I was just saving them so I could donate them to shelters and other aid-providing organisations.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re feeling benevolent, grab the toiletries every day and stick them in your luggage. They\u2019ll get replenished every day, so keep taking them and then donate them to shelters. Shelters ALWAYS need toiletries. \u2014 Julie S. Lalonde (@JulieSLalonde) October 4, 2019\n\nAs Julie S. Lalonde pointed out in her very clever travel hack thread, shelters and similar organisations are always in need of toiletries, a resource that has to be continuously replenished.\n\nIf you travel a good bit, it\u2019s worth grabbing some extras to give to those in need. To find such an organisation, simply type \u201ctoiletry donations\u201d followed by the name of your city. Just make sure the little bottles and soaps are unopened. Gently used sweaters may be a welcome donation, but there\u2019s no such thing as \u201cgently used\u201d soap.", "description": "As a fan of miniatures and free things, I have always appreciated \u2014 and hoarded \u2014 hotel toiletries.
