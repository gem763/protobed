But Hansen believes there is no special treatment for his side, or any of the other major contenders in the competition, suggesting Erasmus\u2019 words were aimed at influencing Saturday\u2019s referee, Frenchman Jerome Garces.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious what they are trying to do,\u201d Hansen told reporters on Thursday. \u201cI have a lot of respect for South Africa and particularly Rassie, he\u2019s a great coach, but I don\u2019t agree with them trying to put more pressure on the referees. They\u2019re under enough pressure already.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need us coaches doing what he is doing. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are, as a coach or a team, you can always find things after a game and get emotional about the fact that it is against you and not the opposition. We have done it ourselves.\u201d\n\nKleyn abandoned Springboks ambitions to commit to Ireland\n\nWhen Ireland lock Jean Kleyn packed his whole life into three bags and boarded a plane for Munster in 2016, he insists he left behind any ambitions of playing for South Africa.\n\nKleyn qualified on residency just two days before his Ireland debut, the 29-10 victory over Italy in Dublin on August 10.\n\nThe 26-year-old second row then duly dislodged stalwart Leinster lock Devin Toner from Ireland\u2019s 31-man World Cup squad, in a shock so seismic as to leave Brian O\u2019Driscoll in disbelief.\n\nThe former Stormers lock has now claimed that the day he left his native South Africa for Munster was the day he consigned any Springboks aims to the past.\n\n\u201cI figured that if I was coming over I couldn\u2019t have the thought that I\u2019d go back some day,\u201d said Kleyn. \u201cIf I did that, then I\u2019d get a year into it and be homesick, whereas when I committed I committed fully.\n\n\u201cI basically came over with my entire life packed into three bags and that was it for me. I knew that was going to be it for at least the near future, if not the indefinite future. I think just when you get to Ireland you realise the lifestyle is so brilliant.\u201d\n\nPocock and Hooper combine for Wallabies\u2019 World Cup opener against Fiji\n\nDavid Pocock and Michael Hooper will combine in the back row for the first time this year when two-time champion Australia open their World Cup campaign against Fiji on Saturday.\n\nPocock has missed most of the season because of injury but returned in a warm-up match against Samoa and did enough to earn his place in the back row at the expense of Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, shifting to the blindside flank.\n\nHooper will start on the openside and Salakaia-Loto is expected to come in off the bench. Two of the best openside flankers in the game, Pocock and Hooper have regularly combined in the backrow to give Australia speed to the breakdown.\n\nChristian Lealiifano retained his spot at flyhalf in favor of Bernard Foley, who was left out of the match-day 23.", "description": "England reminded of World Rugby betting regulations\u00a0 England\u2018s entire playing squad and backroom staff have signed a document stating that they understand World Rugby\u2018s regulations on anti-corruption and betting.
