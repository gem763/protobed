I really think that's fair, and this problem is obvious now. We will not be the victim of this problem.\n\n\u201cWe play tonight, we wanted to win it, we did that, and if they don't find a proper date for us, then we cannot play the next round and whoever is our opponent will go through.\n\n\u201cOr Arsenal play them.\u201d\n\nThe Reds conceded five times in their meeting with the Gunners, but took the game to penalties after Divock Origi's 94th minute equaliser.\n\nTeenager Curtis Jones topped a fine appearance off the bench by slotting home the winning spot-kick, and when asked about his side's defending, the German admitted: \u201cAs a manager I could worry more about the goals we conceded - but I couldn't care less tonight.\u201d", "description": "Liverpool booked their place in the last eight with a win over Arsenal at Anfield on Wednesday night", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Reuters", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20761630.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-BEL-C1-LIVERPOOL-PRESSER.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
