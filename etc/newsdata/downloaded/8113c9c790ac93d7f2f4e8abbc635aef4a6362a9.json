Dickerson argues that the church in America is dying. The evidence he presents to support this terminal diagnosis is multifaceted.\n\nAccording to Mr. Dickerson, orthodox belief, church attendance and denominational loyalty are all dropping precipitously. As our culture, by way of attrition, transitions from the religious homogeneity of the baby boomers to the therapeutic deism of the millennials, the church, contends Mr. Dickerson, will flounder, flail and lose influence.\n\nPolitical division and partisan disagreement will result in intramural splits. Church attendance will plummet. More than 2.6 million of those who are presently 18-29 years of age are predicted to leave the sanctuary and abandon biblical faith and traditional values over the next 10 years. The trend will accelerate in the decades to come.\n\nThe number of nonreligious and secular Americans will skyrocket while the percentage of conservative Christians \u2014 i.e., those who actually believe the Bible and seek to live their lives by its precepts \u2014 will decline to less than 7 percent of the American population in just a handful of years.\n\nThe days of a Christian majority are over, says Mr. Dickerson. The Judeo-Christian ethic is a thing of the past. But even more sobering than the rise of religious indifference and theological syncretism, he warns, will be the increase in animosity and outright antagonism for biblical values.\n\nThe evidence of Mr. Dickerson\u2019s predictions is replete. Postmodernity\u2019s intolerance for and even hatred of orthodox Christianity is the stuff of the nightly news. Consider just a sampling of recent headlines:\n\nA California pastor is arrested for reading his Bible in public.\n\nA group of Catholic nuns is prosecuted for refusing to provide abortion-inducing drugs to its sisters.\n\nChick-fil-A is banned from numerous university campuses, including Johns Hopkins, Fordham and Emory, simply because of its views on the sanctity of marriage.\n\nThe American Psychological Association considers amending its own Diagnostic and Statistical Manual to include a diagnosis called \u201cintolerant personality disorder\u201d as a description of any Christian who believes sexual behavior should be reserved exclusively for heterosexual marriage.\n\nThe European Union has passed a resolution declaring all people who have an \u201caversion\u201d to unbiblical sexual behavior are guilty of a \u201ccrime\u201d equal to \u201cracism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and sexism \u2026\u201d and should be subject to \u201ccriminal penalties.\u201d\n\nAnd just two weeks ago, a British court ruled that a belief in Genesis 1:27 [the view that humans are created as distinctly male and female] \u201cis incompatible with human dignity.\u201d The court went out to say, \u201cin so far as those beliefs form part of [a] wider faith, such faith does not satisfy the requirement of being worthy of respect in a democratic society.\u201d\n\nThe list of grievances against Christians seems endless. One could fill books with anecdotes calling for the church to be \u201cthrown out and trampled underfoot\u201d by those who hate its piety. Christianity, it appears, is now dysfunctional rather than desirable. Biblical values should be prosecuted rather than promoted. Followers of Christ are an insult to human dignity. We deserve no respect. We need treatment. We deserve to be punished.\n\nIn the face of such news, what are we to do?\n\nThere is an answer, and it is found in the message of the first century church, a church that faced many of the same cultural challenges that we face today.\n\nOur responsibility is quite simple and clear. Do good.\n\nIn the midst of storms that had an eerie resemblance to some of the same dark clouds we now see on our own cultural horizon, St. Paul told the early Christians in Rome to \u201cnot repay evil for evil but to do good!\u201d\n\nHe told the first believers in Galatia to \u201cdo good.\u201d\n\nHe told those being persecuted in Jerusalem to \u201cdo good.\u201d\n\nHe told Timothy to \u201cdo good.\u201d\n\nTime and time again, the early church was admonished to not repay insult for insult, but instead, to heed the very words of Christ and \u201cdo good.\u201d\n\nJesus couldn\u2019t have been more clear: \u201cLet your light so shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father who is in heaven.\u201d\n\nBy responding to intolerance, not in-kind but, rather, by doing good, the church changed the world. Orphans were adopted. Widows were loved. The sick were cured. The poor were fed. The dying were saved. Women were honored. Children were wanted. Hospitals, schools and colleges were founded. Slaves were freed.\n\nChesterton once said, \u201cChristianity has died many times and risen again; for it had a God who knew the way out of the grave.\u201d The church\u2019s way out of what appears to be its present \u201cgrave\u201d of cultural irrelevance is to follow that risen God, who promised that the gates of hell would not prevail against us.\n\nWith confidence in that promise, we are to \u201cbless those who persecute us, bless and curse not\u201d \u2014 and do good.\n\n\u2022 Everett Piper, former president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, is a columnist for The Washington Times and author of \u201cNot A Day Care: The Devastating Consequences of Abandoning Truth\u201d (Regnery 2017).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
