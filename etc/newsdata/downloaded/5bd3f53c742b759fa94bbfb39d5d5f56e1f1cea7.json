And now he\u2019s says the Big Apple\u2019s government needs to step in to re-balance the equation.\n\n\u201cOur small businesses, in particular the restaurant owners, are in trouble,\u201d New York City Councilman Mark Gjonaj (D) told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The Ticker. \u201c[GrubHub] really is taking away from the bottom line of these restaurants and undermines their very existence to keep their doors open.\u201d\n\nGjonaj is helping lead the charge for new regulations that would cap how much delivery companies like Grubhub and Uber Eats (UBER) could make from commissions. A restaurant\u2019s fees for using Grubhub and its subsidiary Seamless typically range anywhere from 10% to 30% per order.\n\nCannibalizing customers?\n\n\"These restaurants wouldn\u2019t mind paying these high fees provided they\u2019re new customers,\u201d Gjonaj explains. \u201cIn fact, the only evidence we\u2019ve seen is that they\u2019re cannibalizing their existing customer base.\u201d\n\nBOSTON - MARCH 15: Jane Bergman, a delivery driver for Grubhub, leaves El Pelon in Boston on March 15, 2015.

He says he\u2019s hearing far different feedback in meetings with local restaurants owners as chair of the New York City Council\u2019s Committee on Small Business.\n\n\u201cThe evidence that we see now is what was once a very healthy relationship where both profited now looks like a trojan horse where they\u2019ve undermined the very existence of these businesses,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know that the average profit is less than 10%. How is it possible for [restaurants] to survive when they\u2019re paying [nearly] one-third in fees?\u201d\n\nGjonaj makes clear it\u2019s just not Grubhub in his sights.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at the industry as a the whole,\u201d he explains. \u201cObviously consumer behavior is demanding food order apps \u2014 now we want to make sure it\u2019s a healthy relationship.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is on the table at this point.\u201d\n\nNick Robertson is a senior producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "New York City Councilman Mark Gjonaj argues why Grubhub and other food delivery apps are proving a \"trojan horse\" for restaurants and other small businesses, and why it's time for regulators to step in.", "authors": ["Nick Robertson", "Senior Producer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Rm3WbXb5MUIHw72FfEietg--~B/aD0zMjY0O3c9NDYwODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/ecab8bb0-e55f-11e9-bfe9-c22aa9e19e0e", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
