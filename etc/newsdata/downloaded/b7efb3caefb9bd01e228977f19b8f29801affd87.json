It would be followed by more negotiations on core issues like intellectual property and forced technology transfers, the people said.\n\nThe internal deliberations come as a team of Chinese negotiators, led by Vice Premier Liu He, arrived in Washington to resume trade talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin starting Thursday. It\u2019s the first face-to-face talks between senior officials since July.\n\nThe rose more than 0.3%, erasing an earlier loss. U.S. stock futures whipsawed Thursday morning in Asia amid uncertainty about the outcome of the negotiations.\n\nThe discussions around an interim deal come as the Trump administration this week further ramped up pressure on Beijing by blacklisting Chinese technology firms over their alleged role in oppression in the far west region of Xinjiang, as well as placed visa bans on officials linked to the mass detention of Muslims. At the same time, a fight over free speech between China and the NBA, triggered by a tweet backing Hong Kong\u2019s protesters, has underscored the heated tensions.\n\nThe window for such an agreement is closing before the U.S. plans to raise duties to 30% from 25% on about $250 billion of Chinese imports on Oct. 15. Additional duties are set to take effect Dec. 15.\n\nA Chinese official said Wednesday the country was still open to reaching a partial trade deal with the U.S. that may include large purchases of American commodities, but added that success was contingent on President Donald Trump halting further tariffs. Showing progress with a currency pact and other matters this week could serve as a reason to delay next week\u2019s tariff hike. Bloomberg News last month reported the White House was discussing plans for an interim deal.\n\nStill, Trump this week said he preferred a complete trade agreement with China. \u201cMy inclination is to get a big deal. We\u2019ve come this far. But I think that we\u2019ll just have to see what happens. I would much prefer a big deal. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re shooting for,\u201d he said.\n\nA White House spokesman declined to comment. A Treasury spokesman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to fax about the high-level talks.\n\nManipulation Label\n\nNo details were made public about the U.S.-China currency pact reached in February that Mnuchin at the time called the \u201cstrongest\u201d ever. Broader trade negotiations between the two countries broke down in May after the U.S. accused China of backtracking on its commitments. Then, in August, the Trump administration formally declared China a currency manipulator.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the currency language, the pact largely resembles what the U.S. agreed to in a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada and also incorporates transparency commitments included in Group of 20 statements.\n\nStill, Lighthizer cautioned earlier this year that the currency agreement hinges on the overall enforcement of the trade deal. \u201cThere\u2019s no agreement on anything until there\u2019s agreement on everything. But the reality is we have spent a lot of time on currency, and it\u2019ll be enforceable,\u201d he said in congressional testimony on Feb. 27.\n\nThe senior negotiators from the U.S. and China are scheduled to hold talks through Friday, people familiar with the plans said. Liu met with a small group of business executives and separately with International Monetary Fund officials Wednesday afternoon, people familiar with the meetings said.\n\n(Updates with markets in fourth paragraph.)", "description": "U.S. Weighing Currency Pact With China as Part of Partial Deal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic24f42053a8703dbdb1e584a86f369a81.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
