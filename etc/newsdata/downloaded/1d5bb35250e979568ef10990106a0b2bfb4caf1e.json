However, losses also widened amid a renewed period of investment, growing to \u00a33.8m.\n\nMind Candy was a star of London\u2019s technology scene in the mid 2000s, developing its online Moshi Monsters game series to appeal to young web users.\n\nFounded in 2003, at one stage it was turning over more than \u00a345m and had nearly 200 staff. But it was hit by the rise of mobile gaming and saw revenues fall, dropping as low as \u00a33.5m and cutting headcount to 22.\n\nNow, the firm is growing again, according to Ian Chambers, who took over from founder Michael Acton Smith in 2016.\n\nThe company has launched new products in recent years. A website called Petlandia, which turns pictures of children\u2019s pets into story books; and Moshi Twilight. Moshi Twilight includes bedtime stories and soothing sounds to help put children to sleep.", "description": "Children-focused technology company Mind Candy has secured a further \u00a32.", "authors": ["Matthew Field", "James Titcomb", "Robin Pagnamenta", "Ben Marlow"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/10/11/BrianBlessedV3-1-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZgEkZX3M936N5BQK4Va8RWtT0gK_6EfZT336f62EI5U.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
