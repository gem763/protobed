So you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed it\u2019s, well...\"\n\nThe clip then cuts to Bradby asking how Meghan is doing.\n\nThe duchess replies: \"Thank you for asking, because not many people have asked if I\u2019m OK. But it\u2019s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.\"\n\nFootage from the interview has gone viral on social media and inspired the hashtag #WeLoveYouMeghan which saw other women opening up about their own struggles and sharing messages of encouragement for Meghan.\n\nOne person on Twitter wrote: \"Thank you Meghan Markle, for every new mum, for every woman who is expected to always be OK..\n\n\"For every woman who has has answered \u2018fine\u2019 when asked how they are. For every woman who hasn\u2019t been fine and who hasn\u2019t felt they could tell anyone.\n\n\"Thank you. #WeLoveYouMeghan.\"\n\nAnother said: \"Thank you Meghan for saying that you 'are not OK.' Black women cannot always be OK, even when you're royalty. Thank you for being vulnerable and showing how expanisve Black womanhood is. We see you.\"\n\nA third user replied: \"It wasn\u2019t that long ago that I was a new mom, and I certainly will never forget the postpartum depression. Can\u2019t imagine having to live under royal and public scrutiny on top of all the responsibilities. #WeLoveYouMeghan.\"\n\n\"This made me so emotional. Pregnant women need support. Moms with newborns need support. Moms need support. This woman is doing all of this & her life is under scrutiny 24/7. She is amazing,\" proclaimed someone else.\n\n\"Seeing #WeLoveYouMeghan trending and seeing the love she is getting is making my heart full. It is also a reminder no how much hate you get and how alone you feel, there is always someone who cares. Reach out and be open and honest. If you're not OK, say it,\" added a fifth.", "description": "Meghan Markle opened up in a recent interview about the scrutiny she faced during her pregnancy and as a new mum", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20648594.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Meghan-Markle.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
