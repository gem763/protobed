Italians and foreigners can apply from Monday.\n\nOf course, as with anything that sounds too good to be true, there are one or two caveats. But before we get to those, Toma makes the case.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donato Toma, president of the Molise region, in his office in Campobasso.

You can leave your front door open and car unlocked with the keys inside without worrying \u2026 children can play freely in the streets.\u201d\n\nTo verify Toma\u2019s depiction, the Guardian ventured to Macchiagodena, a hilltop town of about 1,000 people, and Roccasicura, home to 520.\n\nSurrounded by pristine countryside, both towns are well manicured. But they are among the 100 or so desperately in need of a population boost.\n\n\u201cWe lose around 10 people a year to death, and only around four babies a year are born,\u201d said Fabio Milano, the mayor of Roccasicura.\n\nRoccasicura has a bar, grocery shop, chemist, butchers and artisanal cobbler. Its one school was forced to close in 2011 due to a shortage of children. There is a church, castle and countless trails for trekking and mountain biking.\n\n\u201cFor me, Roccasicura is the most beautiful town in Molise,\u201d said Milano. \u201cThe main difficulty is that there are so few of us, which leaves us with little money to dedicate to services.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Card players in the bar in Macchiagodena, a hilltop town of about 1,000 people. Photograph: Chris Warde-Jones/The Guardian\n\nMilano said Toma\u2019s initiative could help breathe life into the town, and that he would go a step further by exempting new residents to Roccasicura from paying tax. A home there costs an average \u20ac50,000 to buy and \u20ac150-\u20ac200 a month to rent.\n\nNow for the small print: people who are given the monthly \u201cresidents income\u201d must migrate to a town with fewer than 2,000 people and open a business. The business can be anything, while those who work remotely will also be welcomed so long as they prove they are contributing to the economy, for example by buying or renting a home and signing up to services.\n\n\u201cThis is not a gift, it\u2019s more an assistance,\u201d said Toma.\n\nThe scheme will initially be limited to 40 candidates, and if after a year things are going well, Toma will seek more funding for more people.\n\nBut what do locals make of the idea? Tony Lepore was born in Roccasicura, then moved with his family to Canada, where he lived before moving back at the age of 26. Now in his late 60s, Lepore said: \u201cIt was a big change leaving Toronto, but you get used to it. I\u2019d recommend it either for the very young, or senior citizens \u2013 for the fresh air and tranquillity. For business, there are many opportunities in relation to tourism, as the market is completely open.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Annamaria Iacovone, who runs the butchers in Roccasicura, says it is difficult to maintain a business.

I\u2019m very happy, it\u2019s a wonderful way of life.\u201d\n\nOthers were more cynical. \u201cThe scenery is great but there is no work \u2026 London is much better,\u201d said Paola Ricciutti, Lepore\u2019s cousin.\n\nThe scepticism was more acute in Macchiagodena. \u201cThis idea is a bit ridiculous,\u201d said Fernando Meo as he played cards with his friends in the bar. \u201cYou can\u2019t just gift people \u2013 they need to come here to work and create work.\u201d\n\nBut Toma is undeterred by those scoffing at his plan, especially since being inundated with inquiries when the news of it broke, particularly after a story by the Guardian.\n\nHe has a message for disillusioned Britons keen to escape Brexit: \u201cCome to Molise \u2026 on top of everything else, we have abundant sunshine.\u201d", "description": "Molise is offering \u20ac700 a month to newcomers who settle in underpopulated areas", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71fdb29245e597a99ecefa4f75e257da47a7998f/39_229_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=730cc209a1090c0c65076a1fa2e67539", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
