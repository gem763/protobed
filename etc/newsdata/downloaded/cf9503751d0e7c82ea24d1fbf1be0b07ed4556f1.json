They didn\u2019t fold on having the game, and one big decision, go badly against them. They displayed a resolve that will be far more important to the future than any single result here.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The result really was all.\n\nThis fixture was one of the eight games Liverpool didn\u2019t win last season, making victory all the more valuable, all the more emboldening.\n\nIt represents the kind of progress required, even though last season\u2019s performance was possibly superior.\n\nBut then that\u2019s perhaps the point. It\u2019s not quite the cliche that Liverpool won without playing all that well, but that they are still learning to win in a slightly different way; maybe the last way required.\n\nThey dug in, having sat back, in a way you wouldn\u2019t really see from Jurgen Klopp's sides.\n\nIt could yet be a key for a scene they haven\u2019t seen at Anfield for 30 years: winning the title.\n\nLampard will meanwhile have seen a little more he liked in this Chelsea, even if the current run of results do not look that good.\n\nHe can point to other positives in this game.\n\nThat change in the game, meanwhile, was all the more marked given the magnificence of Liverpool\u2019s first-half display.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t even a case of Klopp\u2019s team exploiting the vast gaps Lampard\u2019s approach leaves behind Chelsea\u2019s midfield. The gap between the teams was enough for that to be unnecessary.\n\nLiverpool just overpowered them early on, almost every move reflecting a side now so sure of themselves in everything they do, so confident in what they are.\n\nChelsea are by contrast still finding their feet, but aren\u2019t yet fully sure where they\u2019re meant to be standing.\n\nAll of this was illustrated in the first goal.\n\nAs Trent Alexander-Arnold so assuredly and pristinely struck that laid-off free-kick, the shot was itself so difficult to stop, but the full-back enjoyed the benefit of Jorginho pulling out of his block and Emerson Palmeri ducking.\n\nThat should especially irritate Lampard given that full commitment is \u201cthe least you\u2019d expect\u201d, and Chelsea did show it immediately after. It was the source of that ruled-out goal.\n\nThey displayed the value of persistence, refusing to let Liverpool clear it, until Cesar Azpilicueta literally forced it over the line.\n\nThey were just a bit too persistent. Mason Mount was marginally offside, so the goal was correctly \u2013 if belatedly \u2013 ruled out.\n\nWhile there may be fair complaints about the time that took after the actual moment of offside, there should be none about the space. This wasn\u2019t like Tottenham Hotspur against Leicester City. Mount was visibly offside.\n\nThe further problem with that for Chelsea was Liverpool being so far ahead as a team. The sense was always they were only going to get a limited number of chances with the game in the balance, and that was displayed all too brutally.\n\nLiverpool just went up straight up the other end and went further ahead in the game. It was from yet another set-piece \u2013 reflecting another growing problem to fix for Lampard \u2013 as Andy Robertson curled in a perfect cross for Firmino to benefit from imperfect marking. The Brazilian was left to rise and head straight past Kepa Arrizabalaga, as Alonso \u2013 the replacement for the injured Emerson \u2013 barely got off the ground.\n\nIt was evidently something Lampard began to address at half-time, though, because Chelsea did display admirable persistence in another manner.\n\nThey refused to give up. They began to press Liverpool back.\n\nIf the expectation after Firmino\u2019s goal would have been that Chelsea having to open out to see that defence overwhelmed, and leave N\u2019Golo Kante with too much to do, the opposite happened.\n\nKante wasn\u2019t plugging holes, but creating them in the other side. He began to surge forward with the rest of the Chelsea team, firing that fine strike to make it 2-1.\n\nIt was all the more frustrating for Klopp as he\u2019d clearly seen it coming, having been manically gesturing to his players about this beforehand, and then reacting furiously after it.\n\nHis players could have done with some of that emotion. A limpness \u2013 maybe complacency \u2013 had conditioned their game, allowing Kante to just go through unchallenged.\n\nThe European champions had lost control of the game, precisely because they tried to just control the space, to just sit on their lead.\n\nIt\u2019s not something they\u2019re that comfortable or confident in.\n\nIt was something they just about managed, though.\n\nThey may have lost control, but didn\u2019t lose the lead.\n\nThey instead just keep winning.\n\nAnd it means the question is again rising: where will they slip up?\n\nPotential answers feel limited, because they\u2019ve found a few new responses of their own.", "description": "Liverpool\u00a0remain domestically unstoppable, although only after one big stoppage in play, and a lot of stomach-turning bumps.
