He was the head of the army by age 52 and less than a year after launching his political career has become a top prospect for prime minister, potentially the third army chief of staff to reach that position after Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak.\n\n\u201cNobody knows what kind of politician he\u2019s going to be,\u201d said Anshel Pfeffer, a columnist for Haaretz and biographer of Netanyahu. \u201cThe campaign didn\u2019t tell us, and Gantz has never been in this kind of limelight before.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFor his political team, Gantz\u2019s lack of a political record was an asset, allowing him to be presented as a battle-tested general and a centrist alternative to Netanyahu without tying him to specifics. One political commentator here compared him to Chauncey Gardiner, the Peter Sellers character from the 1979 movie \u201cBeing There\u201d who rose to presidential heights by uttering platitudes.\n\nAD\n\nGantz\u2019s path to power is still uncertain. He faces the same closely divided Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament, that stymied Netanyahu. He will have a month to find 61 lawmakers willing to support his bid to lead the country. If he fails to break the gridlock, Israel could endure its third national election in a year.\n\nIf he succeeds, he will crack the grip of the country\u2019s longest-serving leader. With that prospect in view, Israelis are beginning to focus on the tall, blue-eyed former paratrooper who could well become the post-Netanyahu face of the nation.\n\nAD\n\nGantz, who turned 60 shortly before the election, grew up in a farming village in southern Israel founded by Holocaust survivors. Among them were his Hungarian and Romanian parents, who met on a ship on their way to Israel. The only boy amid three sisters, he began his military service at 18 and joined a paratrooper brigade.\n\nAD\n\nHe didn\u2019t leave the ranks for almost four decades, a career that would put him in the middle of some of the country\u2019s most momentous conflicts.\n\nAmong his first assignments was providing security for Egyptian President Anwar Sadat\u2019s groundbreaking visit to Israel in 1977. He was the commander of forces in southern Lebanon when Israel pulled out of the country in 2000, and he rode in the last armored vehicle over the border. The Palestinian uprising in the Gaza Strip known as the Second Intifada erupted soon after he took charge of the division responsible for security in the region.\n\nAD\n\nIt is an action-packed r\u00e9sum\u00e9. But his men remember an officer who seldom raised his voice.\n\n\u201cHe never had to scream,\u201d said Aharon Fuchs, who served eight years under Gantz in the 1980s. \u201cHe just talked. It was with his eyes that he would tell you that you didn\u2019t do something well.\u201d\n\nGantz was known to make friends all along the chain of command, said Fuchs, down to the lowliest cooks and mechanics. For decades, the two have gone together every year to visit the family of a comrade killed on the Lebanese border. It\u2019s one of several such honor calls Gantz is known to pay in a calendar filled with anniversaries of those who fell under his command.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFirst we go to the cemetery and then to the house,\u201d Fuchs said. \u201cWhen Benny comes to a family like this, it\u2019s like he\u2019s coming to a holy place.\u201d\n\nBut Gantz has his critics. Some of his military peers have told reporters that Gantz\u2019s meetings \u2014 known to be long affairs where everyone gets to talk \u2014 sometimes smacked of indecision.\n\nNaftali Bennett, a former education minister who served in Netanyahu\u2019s government, went further, blaming Gantz\u2019s slow response as chief of staff during the 2014 Gaza war with the Palestinian militant group Hamas for producing a stalemate.\n\n\u201cIf Hamas leaders could vote, they would vote for Benny Gantz, the hesitant general,\u201d Bennett told the Irish Times during the campaign.\n\nAD\n\nGantz\u2019s restraint, however, has also won him plaudits. One night in the 1980s, when Gantz was leading a patrol south of Jerusalem during the Palestinian uprising known as the First Intifada, molotov cocktails exploded beside his jeep. He and his men jumped out, but Gantz stopped them from firing into the dark.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was the middle of the night, we didn\u2019t see anyone, so he didn\u2019t want us to shoot,\u201d said Dan Emergui, a radio man who was in the vehicle. \u201cBenny has the right considerations.\u201d\n\nOne of the missions Gantz recalls most fondly, friends say, was his command of a ground unit in Addis Ababa during Operation Solomon, the secret 36-hour airlift of more than 14,000 Ethiopian Jews to Israel in 1991.\n\nAD\n\nThe general has a preference for humanitarian tasks over combat, said a senior officer who rose through the ranks with Gantz and served with him on the general staff. After Gantz left the military in 2015, for instance, he worked on education projects in Jewish and Bedouin groups in the Negev desert.\n\n\u201cIt all goes back to his roots, everything that his parents experienced,\u201d said the senior officer, citing in particular his mother\u2019s experience at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t hesitate in these operations, but he\u2019s not a guy who wants to hurt human beings.\u201d\n\nTales from the campaign trail, his supporters say, suggest Gantz has brought the same humanity to his second career. During the political campaign earlier this year, unconfirmed reports circulated that his cellphone had been hacked, perhaps by Iranian intelligence, perhaps revealing salacious material. It was the kind of anonymous attack common in Israeli politics, and some of his advisers pushed Gantz to take some swipes at Netanyahu\u2019s domestic drama. He refused.\n\n\u201cBenny insisted on staying calm, even if it would cost him more votes,\u201d said Chili Tropper, a Knesset member from Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party. \u201cHe said he would not attack Bibi\u2019s family,\u201d Tropper added, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut if Gantz does not want to engage in the rough stuff personally, he did not stop his campaign team from doing so. Working to establish the security credibility vital in Israel, the team introduced Gantz in videos that were more blood-and-guts than bread-and-honey, touting the \u201cterrorists killed\u201d and the Gaza neighborhoods bombed when he led the army.\n\nHis war record has cost him support from Israel\u2019s Arab population. A slate of Arab parties, which finished third in the parliamentary voting after Gantz and Netanyahu\u2019s factions, broke with decades of precedent to throw their support behind Gantz\u2019s bid to become prime minister. But one of the factions backed out within hours, saying it could not endorse a \u201cwar criminal.\u201d\n\nHis measured, deliberate style, however, has already paid dividends in his political career, his backers say. The most recent example, they say, was his ability to wrangle the fractured, squabbling center-left of Israel\u2019s political spectrum into his Blue and White party, which slightly outpolled Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party in the election last month.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNine months ago, he was not even involved in politics,\u201d said Tropper. \u201cOnly a person with his temperament could do this.\u201d\n\nRuth Eglash contributed to this report.", "description": "Voters know little about the former army chief who will now try to form a government.", "authors": ["Steve Hendrix", "Jerusalem Bureau Chief Steve Hendrix Has Written For Foreign", "National", "Local", "Most Other Sections Of The Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8KpApztmQnnVdjDAd_5223hK5tM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XK2A2RHUVII6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
