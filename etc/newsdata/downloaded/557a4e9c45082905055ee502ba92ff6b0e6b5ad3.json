I want to talk to him. In fact, more than anyone else, this person should be here because maybe he could learn something, and that\u2019s the superintendent of the Chicago Police, Eddie Johnson.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s decision to boycott the event angered the city\u2019s chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, which said in a Facebook post that \u201csuch a gesture would be an insult to both President Trump and the office of the presidency itself and would be a mark of disgrace upon the city throughout the entire nation, including Mayor Lori Lightfoot.\u201d\n\nBut the Democratic mayor and Illinois\u2019 Democratic governor stood in solidarity with Johnson, who announced days before the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference that he would not attend.\n\n\u201cThis is the land of Lincoln and when you come to the state of Illinois you should respect all the people who live here in the state of Illinois,\u201d said Gov. J.B. Pritzker.\n\nLightfoot also refused to meet with Trump, and said on Twitter that she supports Johnson.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that @realDonaldTrump brought his insulting, ignorant buffoonery to Chicago,\u201d the mayor tweeted. \u201cLuckily, in this city, we know the truth and we will not let anyone \u2014 no matter how high the office \u2014 denigrate who we are as a people or our status as a welcoming city.\u201d\n\n\u201cRather than belittle Chicago\u2019s communities with hateful and dishonest rhetoric, he needs to go back to D.C. and face his fate,\u201d Lightfoot said, apparently referring to the House impeachment inquiry against the president.\n\nTrump has frequently criticized Chicago for its crime problems and status as a sanctuary city , one of scores of cities around the country that refuse to work with federal authorities to round up people who are living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nAt a news conference later Monday, Johnson said Trump had ignored a \u201cdouble digit\u201d reduction in violent crime in the city over the past three years.\n\nTrump has long held up the nation\u2019s third-largest city as the poster child of urban violence and dysfunctional Democratic politics.\n\nAt one point in the address, Trump turned his daily complaint about the impeachment inquiry into a swipe at \u201cEmpire\u201d actor Jussie Smollett, who authorities say fabricated a claim about being attacked by Trump supporters in Chicago earlier this year.\n\n\u201cYou have the case of this wise guy Jessie Smollett \u2026 and he said MAGA country did it,\u201d Trump said, using the acronym for his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign slogan. \u201cIt\u2019s a real big scam, just like the impeachment of your president is a scam.\u201d\n\nThe FOP Lodge 7, which represents rank-and-file Chicago police officers, announced that it had cast a vote of no confidence in Johnson. The union\u2019s president, Kevin Graham, was first to greet Trump on the tarmac of O\u2019Hare International Airport, after he landed in the city.\n\nIn the speech, Trump rattled off Chicago crime statistics and claimed that Johnson puts the needs of people living in the U.S. illegally above those of law-abiding residents of Chicago. \u201cThose are his values and frankly those values to me are a disgrace,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI want Eddie Johnson to change his values and to change them fast.\u201d\n\nDuring the conference, Trump signed an executive order creating a presidential commission on law enforcement to study issues like substance abuse, homelessness and mental illness. The president also announced that the Justice Department will begin a \u201csurge\u201d to crack down on violent crime in the United States, targeting gang members and drug traffickers in high-crime areas.\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, is under internal investigation after he was found sleeping in a city-owned vehicle earlier this month. Lightfoot said Johnson, who called for the investigation, told her he had \u201ca couple of drinks with dinner\u201d before he fell asleep at a stop sign while driving home. Johnson blamed the episode on a change in his blood pressure medication.\n\nWhile in Chicago, Trump headlined a campaign luncheon at his hotel in the city, raising approximately $4 million for a joint fundraising committee benefiting Trump\u2019s reelection effort and the Republican National Committee, according to the GOP.\n\nThousands of demonstrators rallied outside the hotel, waving colorful signs that said \u201cImpeach Trump Now\u201d and \u201cQuid Pro Quo Trump Must Go.\u201d They also shouted chants such as \u201cLock him up\u201d and \u201cTrump must go.\u201d\n\nSome said they came to protest out of a fear for the country they have never felt before.\n\n\u201cIt will take decades to put things back in place,\u201d said Caroline Mooney, a 61-year-old marketing analyst from the Chicago suburb of Tinley Park.\n\n\u201cIf something doesn\u2019t happen next November, we may not recover,\u201d said her friend Steve Schaibley, who drove 2-1/2 hours from Livingston County.\n\nThe gathering was mostly peaceful. But two people were taken into custody after apparently attacking a man waving a Trump flag. The Trump supporter was bloodied but did not appear to have been seriously injured.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Darlene Superville in Washington and Michael Balsamo in Chicago contributed to this report.", "description": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Visiting Chicago for the first time as president, Donald Trump disparaged the city Monday as a haven for criminals that is \"embarrassing to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/28/a8c18a_trump-25001-donald-trump-president-donald-trump-speaks-international-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
