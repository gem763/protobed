Next year\u2019s vote, and others around the world, have the feeling, however, of being not just about how the economy is performing in the moment but about something more fundamental: the economic system. What drove the rise of Donald Trump and politicians like him elsewhere was the promise that a new government with new policies could restore a fondly remembered (by some) economic and social order from the past. Those politicians\u2019 opponents on the left have a similar interest, though with completely different specifics, in remaking the political economy. It seems like centuries ago, though it was actually only four or five election cycles, when immediate economic conditions were a political issue but not the basic design of the economy.\n\nWhat brought about this dramatic shift? To understand that, it\u2019s necessary first to recall what the American economic order used to be and what made it come apart.\n\nA good place to begin is at Bennington College in Vermont during the worst years of World War II. Two \u00e9migr\u00e9 Viennese intellectuals, Peter Drucker and Karl Polanyi, had holed up there to teach. Drucker, who went on to become probably the world\u2019s most famous management consultant, was then in his early 30s, orderly and ambitious; Polanyi, more than a decade older, was messy and voluble and considerably to the left of Drucker politically. Each of them was working on a book proposing a large social vision for the second half of the 20th century.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Should American corporations return to being social as well as economic institutions? Join the conversation below.\n\nThrough the long Vermont winters, Drucker and Polanyi would trudge between each other\u2019s houses in the snow so they could argue about their books. Polanyi\u2019s \u201cThe Great Transformation\u201d treated the rise of unimpeded modern capitalism as a vast, long-running social disaster. \u201cAt the heart of the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthere was an almost miraculous improvement in the tools of production, which was accompanied by a catastrophic dislocation of the lives of the common people.\u201d The only possible lasting solution to the problem of capitalism, he believed, was for government to make itself such a forceful presence that the economy would be made the servant of society instead of society being the servant of the economy.\n\nDrucker\u2019s book was called \u201cThe Future of Industrial Man: A Conservative Approach.\u201d The subtitle was apt. He saw the end product of the Industrial Revolution as the modern corporation, which was an institution he very much admired. Drucker thought government control of the economy would lead to \u201ccentralized bureaucratic despotism.\u201d Instead, the corporation, on its own rather than under the government\u2019s direction, must invent something heretofore unknown: \u201ca functioning industrial society.\u201d\n\nEmployees in the cafeteria of GM\u2019s Assembly Plant in Fremont, Calif., in 1961.

How would he like to come to Detroit for a couple of years and find out how GM actually worked? Drucker eagerly accepted the offer, and in 1946 he published a book about what he had found, called \u201cConcept of the Corporation.\u201d There he reprised his theory in much more florid terms. \u201cThe large industrial unit has become our representative social actuality,\u201d he declared, \u201cand its social organization, the large corporation in this country, is our representative social institution.\u201d\n\nDuring his research, Drucker became friendly with GM\u2019s president, Charles E. Wilson. (He\u2019s the man remembered for saying, \u201cFor years I thought what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa.\u201d) The two of them, according to Drucker, had conversations about GM\u2019s social role that helped nudge Wilson toward negotiating, in 1950, the Treaty of Detroit, a five-year contract with the United Auto Workers that established annual raises, company-provided health insurance and pensions, and a measure of job security for workers as norms of American corporate life.\n\n\u201c Corporate employment was an American exceptionalist version of the welfare state. \u201d\n\nIt was during this period that President Harry Truman was failing to achieve most of his Fair Deal, a proposed ramping up of the welfare state that included a prototype version of what liberal politicians would now call \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d That failure left government playing a role inconsistent with Karl Polanyi\u2019s ideas and the corporation playing a role consistent with Drucker\u2019s. Corporate employment was an American exceptionalist version of the welfare state.\n\nIt is stating the obvious to point out that this system no longer exists. One often hears calls for big corporations to be socially responsible\u2014last month, the Business Roundtable added its voice in a statement signed by 181 corporate chief executives\u2014but not for them to serve collectively as the major American social (rather than economic) institution. For a quarter-century or so during the mid-20th century, however, this was lived reality for millions of Americans who dutifully served the corporations where they worked until they retired at 65 on generous defined-benefit pensions, suppressing whatever independent or entrepreneurial impulses they may have had in exchange for the company\u2019s loyalty to them. And a coterie of establishment-oriented liberal intellectuals trumpeted the arrangement as a not-half-bad social and political order, since a Western European welfare state seemed unachievable in the U.S.\n\nSo what happened? Besides being vulnerable because it was a product more of custom than of law, the corporation-based welfare state, in retrospect, had two major weaknesses. It mainly excluded large groups with rising aspirations, like racial and ethnic minorities and women, so they felt little stake in preserving the system. Even more consequentially, it depended on the corporation\u2019s economic invulnerability and the quiescence of its shareholders.\n\nAdolf Berle served as part of Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s \u2018Brain Trust.\u2019 Photo: Bob Landry/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images\n\nBack in the dawning days of the New Deal, when the economic role of government was dramatically enhanced, Adolf Berle, one of President Franklin Roosevelt \u2019s Brain Trusters, published a book arguing that the modern corporation represented a historically unprecedented situation: the separation of ownership from control. That was because, in his view, stocks and bonds were so widely dispersed among small holders that corporate management could do whatever it wanted. Whether or not this was accurate, Roosevelt, Berle and others were able to use the idea of the all-powerful, unaccountable corporation as justification to create laws and regulations that imposed many new obligations on the major institutions of the private economy\u2014everything from Social Security and modern labor laws to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n\nUntil his death in 1971, Berle was proclaiming the success of the new, corporation-based social order, which depended not just on government\u2019s forceful role but also on the continued disempowerment of shareholders, and of Wall Street generally. Peter Drucker said similar things in those days. So did Berle\u2019s friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and the country\u2019s best-known liberal economist, John Kenneth Galbraith.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s always tempting to think about the way things turned out as having been inevitable\u2014as the only possible response to vast, irresistible forces\u2014but history is always contingent. \u201d\n\nBut the connection between ownership and control was soon re-established, with enormous effects, economic and otherwise. The key figure in this shift is Michael C. Jensen, a now-retired Harvard Business School professor who in 1976 co-wrote an essay called \u201cTheory of the Firm.\u201d One of the most cited academic publications of all time, it is an attack on the corporation for failing to fulfill its obligations\u2014not to society but to its shareholders. Jensen and his co-author, William Meckling, proposed a series of measures to correct then-prevailing ideas about corporate governance. They argued that the owners of stocks and bonds should push corporate management to attend very closely to the price of their company\u2019s shares and less closely, if at all, to the needs of society.\n\nThis became the theoretical accompaniment to a great remaking of the relationship between corporations and finance, which put finance in a much more empowered position. Jensen regularly wrote and testified in Congress in favor of new mechanisms like leveraged buyouts, large grants of stock options to chief executives and sweeping mergers and acquisitions, all of which he believed would empower shareholders. (He has since renounced some of these views.) Larger developments\u2014like the growth of institutional investing, the dismantling of the New Deal\u2019s restrictions on corporations and financial institutions, and the exposure of American business to fierce new global competition\u2014were also strong winds pushing the new economic arrangements forward.\n\nIt\u2019s always tempting to think about the way things turned out as having been inevitable\u2014as the only possible response to vast, irresistible forces\u2014but history is always contingent. While the postwar global hegemony of the American corporation was ending, most obviously because of competition from our vanquished former enemies, Japan and Germany, those countries were developing political economies that combined competitiveness with far more economic cushioning than the late-20th-century American system provided. Both Japan and Germany, and many other countries in the world, provided much greater job security to employees of big companies, a much less disruptive market for corporate control and a significantly higher level of protection for corporate managers from the momentary impulses of the financial markets.\n\nThese were explicit features of their political systems, in a way they no longer were in the U.S. Our new system was perhaps the most libertarian in the world, built around the goal of being able to change existing economic arrangements very rapidly.\n\nBut there was a problem. The shareholder revolution and the rise of finance made the kind of social vision that Berle, Drucker and others were promoting for post-World War II America impossible to sustain. People who were fortunate and adept enough to readjust their lives in response to the remaking of the political economy prospered. At Harvard Business School, where all incoming students were once required to read Alfred P. Sloan \u2019s \u201cMy Years With General Motors,\u201d interest quickly shifted to courses like Michael Jensen\u2019s on the market for corporate control and to careers in finance and consulting rather than corporate management.\n\nFor many more Americans, however, a few generations\u2019 worth of certainty\u2014expectations about job security, intergenerational progress, the stability of institutions and communities\u2014abruptly and mysteriously vanished. Some people and some places seemed to be doing very well indeed, but many others were falling behind. There was no more payoff, evidently, to being an exemplar of that venerable type, the Organization Man. Now the payoff was for the Transaction Man or Woman, someone who took established economic institutions apart and reassembled them in a more strictly market-oriented form. But the world had room for only a limited number of those.\n\nWorkers from GM\u2019s Lordstown, Ohio plant, which closed this year, protest in Detroit in July.

Back in the 1960s, the historian Richard Hofstadter published an essay called \u201cWhat Happened to the Antitrust Movement?\u201d arguing that what had been an all-consuming issue in American politics, the central concern of mass movements and of presidential campaigns, was now of interest only to experts, not the public.\n\nToday antitrust is back on center stage, with the big technology companies playing the former role of the railroads, Standard Oil and the \u201cmoney trust.\u201d At least two of the top-tier Democratic presidential candidates, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have rooted their campaigns in a critique of the new economy. Donald Trump and Boris Johnson have become unlikely heads of state partly by departing from the elite consensus on trade. Socialism and right-wing nationalism are popping up all over the world, both motivated by economic insecurity and discontent.\n\nWhat\u2019s noteworthy about the new political dispensation is not just its anti-elite emotional charge but also its focus on direct government involvement in the economic affairs of institutions. Even economically oriented liberals have been trained for years to regard policies like managed trade, state-mandated setting of wages and prices, and breaking up big companies as foolhardy, especially when much more effective tools for managing the economy, like setting the overall rates of taxes, interest and government spending, were available. The new economic politics defies this old consensus and includes a range of proposed interventions to counter insecurity and inequality directly: higher minimum wages, tariffs, price controls (on, for example, college tuition), antitrust, enhanced government benefits.\n\nIt isn\u2019t at all clear where the new economic politics will lead\u2014or whether it will wind up as a cause of the left or the right. We are on unfamiliar terrain, with each major party accusing the other of being the pawn of economic elites and big business. What\u2019s indisputable is that the certainties of the late 20th century about how ordinary people\u2019s lives were supposed to be organized economically have disappeared. No less than when Peter Drucker and his colleagues were writing their midcentury manifestos, a great reordering of political and economic arrangements is at hand. It is only beginning. It will be contentious and consequential.\n\nMr. Lemann is a staff writer at the New Yorker and the dean emeritus of Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.
