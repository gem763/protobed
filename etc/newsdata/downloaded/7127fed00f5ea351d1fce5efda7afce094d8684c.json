He got his bike stolen and that was the fire he needed to become the greatest boxer of all time,\u201d said Langer.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They won that Test match, so we felt a bit like it\u2019d been stolen from us. Now we\u2019ve got to work out what we\u2019re going to do, and use that as fire. We\u2019re not going to feel sorry for ourselves and let it slip.\n\n\u201cThe great players and great teams \u2013 in business and life \u2013 they have their ups and downs but they always fight back from it. You wouldn\u2019t see one champion player, one champion team, one champion business that hasn\u2019t done that.\u201d\n\nAustralia will make one change to their side for certain, with star batsman Steve Smith back after the concussion caused by a 92mph Jofra Archer bouncer ruled him out in Leeds.\n\nWith his stand-in, Marnus Labuschagne, impressing so far, Smith could replace opener Marcus Harris, forcing Usman Khawaja up a place to open.\n\nThere are also decisions to be made in the bowling attack, with Mitchell Starc straining at the leash for his first outing of the series following his leading role at the World Cup. James Pattinson is the man most likely to make way.\n\nAs for Smith, Langer expects him to prove his class under the inevitable barrage of bouncers that come his way.\n\n\u201cWhen you get hit, it\u2019s always a little voice on your shoulder. You\u2019ve got to have a good strategy and he works the game out better than anyone I\u2019ve ever met in my life,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe would\u2019ve thought long and hard about it. If anyone\u2019s going to get over any little demons it\u2019ll be Steven .\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s faced lots of short-pitched bowling in his life. A lot of it will be how he organises his mind and as I\u2019ve said, he organises it better than anybody.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Justin Langer says Ben Stokes\u2019 audacious match-winning efforts at Headingley left Australia\u00a0feeling like the Ashes were \u201cstolen\u201d.
