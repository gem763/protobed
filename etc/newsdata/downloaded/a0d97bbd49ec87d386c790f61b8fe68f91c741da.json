But this son of Taiwanese immigrants still managed to distinguish himself as a New New Democrat who broadly shares his party\u2019s progressive goals but doesn\u2019t always endorse its big-government solutions. A lawyer turned entrepreneur, Yang seems to understand intuitively that good public policy involves not Elizabeth Warren\u2013style 10-point programs that empower bureaucrats and technocrats\u2014or Bernie Sanders\u2013style hostility to private industry\u2014but devolving power to individuals.\n\nHe kicked off in a decidedly un-Kennedyesque spirit by extolling the primacy of the individual over the collective. \u201cWe have to get our country working for us again, not the other way around,\u201d he declared. \u201cWe have to see ourselves as the owners and shareholders of this democracy rather than inputs into a giant machine.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Shikha Dalmia", "Reason.Com Andrew-Yang-Is-The-Anti-Elizabeth-Warren"], "top_image": ""}
