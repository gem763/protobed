Our story out today shows how Trump\u2019s ability to sniff out weak spots in others is behind his selective outreach.\n\nMore broadly, as one diplomat says, any leader must be prepared for strange and unexpected requests when Trump calls. The trick is to stay positive without committing to anything and to speak guardedly, because the transcript might become public.\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing how Trump\u2019s chats with individual leaders \u2014 and his tendency to make policy on the fly \u2014 could affect not just the U.S. election. Take Turkey, which may invade Syria after he effectively gave Recep Tayyip Erdogan a green light over the phone.\n\nThe president\u2019s actions risk sowing policy confusion \u2014 read here for Nick Wadhams\u2019 and Glen Carey\u2019s take on that.\n\nAnd they may have unintended consequences. As Marc Champion reports, Trump\u2019s pledged withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria would leave Moscow dealing with Turkey, a weaker and more compliant player.The president says the move is a \u201cwin\u201d for America. But it could be a \u201cwin-win\u201d where Russia benefits, too.\n\nGlobal Headlines\n\nJust in: U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told German Chancellor Angela Merkel that a Brexit deal is essentially impossible if the European Union demands Northern Ireland stay in the bloc\u2019s customs union, according to a British official. The pound fell to its weakest level against the euro since Sept. 9.\n\nUnusually Quiet | Erdogan, who doesn\u2019t usually mince his words when under attack, has been suspiciously quiet since Trump threatened to obliterate Turkey\u2019s economy should its army act in excess in Syria. The Turkish leader kept a low profile when Trump made a similar threat earlier this year. Erdogan appears to be following the same playbook even as his army prepares for an incursion to fight Kurdish militants in the border region with Syria.\n\nNo regrets | Two weeks after seven first-term House Democrats representing Trump-leaning districts decided to back an impeachment inquiry of the president, he has erased any lingering doubts they may have had about the risks to their own re-election chances in 2020, Erik Wasson and David Welch report.\n\nTrump\u2019s impeachment defense strategy will be put to the test today as one of his top diplomats appears before House committees to explain the president\u2019s call for Ukraine to investigate 2020 rival Joe Biden. Biden unveiled an education plan today that focuses on making colleges more affordable and boosting employment opportunities for those without a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nTalking while fighting | China\u2019s Foreign Ministry warned the U.S. to \u201cstay tuned\u201d for retaliation after it black-listed eight of the country\u2019s technology companies for alleged involvement in human rights violations against Muslim minorities in the far-western region of Xinjiang. The sanctions are among several disputes \u2014 including disagreements over China\u2019s handling of unrest in Hong Kong and its efforts to isolate Taiwan \u2014 on the boil just as Chinese negotiators prepare to resume trade talks in the U.S.\n\nA unit of Activision Blizzard has banned a player for expressing support for Hong Kong\u2019s protest movement, the latest company attempting to rein in speech that might displease China.\n\nMending fences | President Jair Bolsonaro took office warning Brazil would be more wary of investment from Beijing, but things seem to have found a warmer footing. Samy Adghirni reports exclusively on a recent all-expenses-paid trip that Brazilian lawmakers made to China. It\u2019s not the only place seeking to reset ties: Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan visits China today to rally support for investment after project spending dropped.\n\nTragic rise | The fallout of the 2010 plane crash that killed Poland\u2019s president and dozens of other officials helped transform one of Europe\u2019s great successes into one of its biggest renegades. Marek Strzelecki and Rodney Jefferson explain how Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the late president\u2019s twin brother, and his Law & Justice party used the disaster as a galvanizing force to gain sway over the courts, state companies and the media. Opinion polls suggest Law & Justice will cement its grip on power in an Oct. 13 election.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Want to receive this post in your inbox every day?\u00a0Sign up\u00a0for the\u00a0Balance of Power\u00a0newsletter, and follow Bloomberg Politics on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for more.As Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry rolls through Congress, leaders around the world must be thinking back to what they\u2019ve said", "authors": ["Rosalind Mathieson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/J1uv1.4nSX8rLiuva1Hlrw--~B/aD0zMDAwO3c9MjAxNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/1bcd7524cecfb4e483917a6d28beffe1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
