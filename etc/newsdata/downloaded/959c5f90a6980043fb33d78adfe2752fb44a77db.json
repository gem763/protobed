The only question entering Saturday\u2019s match, same as last year\u2019s championship showdown against Naomi Osaka, was whether a wildly talented youngster in her first grand slam final could hold her nerve against a champion twice her age. And, same as last year, it wasn\u2019t long before it was obvious Andreescu could.\n\nWilliams, who has won grand slams in her teens (one), 20s (12) and 30s (10, a record), but has been stuck on 23 titles \u2013 one behind Court \u2013 since the 2017 Australian Open, has reached the final in four of the seven majors that she\u2019s entered since coming back from the birth of her daughter, failing to win a set in any of them. She turns 38 at the end of the month and is no longer so far ahead of the pack that another title feels inevitable. This is how sports work.\n\nSerena is not going to break this record. And that\u2019s OK.\n\nWilliams is the greatest women\u2019s tennis player ever, a fact acknowledged deep down by even her most vehement critics. The record, or, specifically, wanting it to be beyond any plausible argument, is merely completism. Yes, major championships are the sort of established metric of greatness that sports fans dine on by mooring otherwise impossible cross-generational comparisons, but it\u2019s fair to consider that more than half of Court\u2019s 24 titles came before the Open era when the sport\u2019s four bedrock events allowed professionals to compete with amateurs. Eleven came at the Australian Open during a time when many of the world\u2019s best declined to enter due to the distance and comparatively minute prize fund on offer.\n\nBianca Andreescu sees a remarkable vision come true at US Open | Tumaini Carayol Read more\n\nThat\u2019s not a slight to Court so much as context essential to grasping the scope of Williams\u2019 body of work in a sport that\u2019s never been more globalized and competitive, an evolution that\u2019s only accelerated since Williams turned professional way back in 1995. Yet it\u2019s never been clearer the final steps to yardstick supremacy may be a bridge too far. \u201cI\u2019m, like, so close, so close, so close,\u201d Williams lamented after Saturday\u2019s defeat, \u201cyet so far away.\u201d\n\nFour summers ago when Williams won Wimbledon for a sixth time to become the oldest player to win a grand slam singles title in the Open era, she improved to a preposterous 21-4 in major finals, redoubling her reputation as the greatest closer in sports. Since then, she\u2019s 2-6 at the final hurdle. Of course it\u2019s a testament to her greatness that she\u2019s even playing that far into majors at an age when most players have decamped to name-brand academies or the broadcasting booth, but there\u2019s no question the loss of her finishing kick, for which she has no answers, is what\u2019s troubled Williams the most.\n\nThe women\u2019s field today is as deep as ever and the young lionesses of the tour, who for years cowered in Williams\u2019s presence before the first ball went up, are no longer intimidated by the sport\u2019s grand dame. Last year it was Osaka. This year it was the fearless Andreescu, now the first player born in the 2000s to win a major, who\u2019s gone more than six months since losing a completed match. It\u2019s not going to get any easier from here.\n\nIt cannot be said enough we\u2019re lucky to be living in Williams\u2019 time. The story of a black female Jehovah\u2019s Witness from Compton, who came from nothing and honed her craft on cracked public courts and persevered in the face of racism, sexism, illness and family tragedy to rewrite the history of a sport predominantly owned, played and watched by rich white people, is the ultimate American folk tale: a champion of the marginalized shining on the world stage. Like Tiger Woods, she\u2019s brought people into the orbit of a sport who never would have bothered to watch a tennis match. And she\u2019s blazed a path for a new generation of African American stars, like Sloane Stephens, Madison Keys, Taylor Townsend and now Coco Gauff, who are no longer cast as outsiders by default.\n\nSurely it\u2019s possible Williams grinds out one more major title to tie Court\u2019s mark or even the two she needs to surpass it. We know she\u2019s more than capable of beating any player on the tour on a given day. She will have more than a puncher\u2019s chance at the notoriously unpredictable Australian Open in January, where she\u2019s already been installed as the betting favorite, or the friendly grass courts of Wimbledon next summer where her thunderbolt serve translates so well. Still, time runs short.\n\nNature may finally be catching up to Serena, but her true impact transcends trophies and leaderboards. Finishing on either side of 24, now more than ever, is immaterial.", "description": "She is the greatest women\u2019s tennis player of all time and deep down even her biggest critics know it.
