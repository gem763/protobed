Tracey Mobley, the student who captured the behaviour on camera, said: 'She looked forlorn as if she was grieving and she kept trying to put it into a tree as if encouraging it to move and hold on, it was very distressing to watch'\n\nThe monkey Miss Mobley saw had given birth to the stillborn infant 10 days before she approached students and they realised what was happening on October 19.\n\nIt's common for primates to continue to care for dead relatives, Miss Mobley said, but not for such a long period of time.\n\nShe added: 'To start with she clung to it at all times and then gradually started to carry it in her hand and left it from time to time, and then she would carry it in her mouth in order to make full use of all of her limbs like when she would climb trees.\n\n'To start with, the monkey was still quite floppy with its arms and legs dangling.\n\n'After a day or so you could see it had become stiff and, towards the end it had become almost mummified and didn't resemble a monkey at all.\n\n'The smell was quite powerful and if she left it near to where you were sitting you could quite clearly smell it.'", "description": "A woman studying at the Olifants West Game Reserve in South Africa said it was 'very sad' to see the mother vervet monkey carrying and grooming her dead infant after more than a week.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/10/20273890-0-image-a-23_1572259616683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
