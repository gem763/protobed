Income of $6.09 billion, or $2.12 a share, also exceeded expectations of $5.53 billion.\n\nFacebook's earnings reflected strong user growth. The Menlo Park, Calif., company said it has 1.62 billion daily active users of the platform, up 9% from just under 1.5 billion a year ago, with most of the new users outside the U.S., Canada and Europe. Average revenue per user rose to $7.26, up 19% from $6.09 a year earlier.\n\nThe company reported an operating margin of 41%, down slightly from last year but well above mid-30s levels Facebook had predicted last year when it said it would increase investments in user safety and security.\n\nFacebook's earnings come amid mixed third-quarter results for technology companies. Twitter Inc. stock fell sharply last week after reporting lower revenue and earnings than expected, and Alphabet Inc.'s profits fell short of forecasts amid higher costs. Snap Inc., meanwhile, reported narrowing losses and faster growth than analysts predicted.\n\nShares of Facebook climbed 2% in after-hours trading following the earnings report. Before Wednesday, the company's shares had risen more than 43% year to date, well ahead of the average for the technology sector.\n\nThe company's strong earnings stand in contrast with its struggles in Washington. Facebook faces antitrust investigations from the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and more than 40 state attorneys general. Meanwhile, leading Democratic presidential candidates and a bipartisan group of congressional lawmakers has faulted the company for alleged bias, inadequately addressing misinformation on its platform or both.\n\nPressure from the Trump administration and lawmakers on Capitol Hill contributed to the departure of key financial-industry partners in Facebook's Libra digital currency project, and the Justice Department has asked the company to shelve plans to introduce an encrypted messaging system across its platform unless it can address alleged public safety risks.\n\nMost recently, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has drawn criticism from some quarters -- including among employees -- for the company's decision to exempt political candidates' advertising from its outside fact-checking program.\n\nFocus on that controversy intensified Wednesday when Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey said his company would stop running ads on its platform about politics and some other controversial issues including immigration.\n\nStill, Facebook continues to power ahead in its business even while grappling with those issues.\n\nWhile the company breaks out only limited information on Instagram, the photo-based social-media platform it acquired in 2012, the parent company's earnings were in keeping with that unit's continued strength. Digital-advertising-buying platform Kenshoo reported that its clients' Instagram spending was up 42% from a year earlier, significantly better than the growth in social-media advertising overall.\n\nFacebook announced its plans to rebrand Instagram and encrypted messaging platform WhatsApp with \"by Facebook,\" in August, a move observers ascribed to the company's desire to burnish the reputation of the main Facebook app.\n\nIn a note following release of Facebook's earnings, SunTrust analysts Youssef Squali and Naved Khan said the results showed \"that value and market share gains within Internet and digital media continue to accrue to the largest players.\"\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Facebook said Sue Desmond-Hellmann is stepping down from the company's board. The former biotech executive and current chief executive of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation had served on the board since 2013.\n\nNews Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Facebook.\n\nWrite to Jeff Horwitz at Jeff.Horwitz@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 17:24 ET (21:24 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
