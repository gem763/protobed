Feel free to give me a call.\u2019\n\nCommenting on the proposition, Stan then said: \u2018Institutional racism for you.\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s get the token black on to talk about racism, but let\u2019s not call him to talk about a sport he played for 20 years. No thanks @GMB, my race isn\u2019t a 2 min bit before you give someone from Geordie Shore an hour to show you their new nails.\u2019\n\nGood Morning Britain producers reached out to Stan Collymore (Picture: Twitter)\n\nStan responded to the email publicly (Picture: Twitter)\n\nPiers later hit back at Stan\u2019s claims and responded on Twitter: \u2018Sorry? We\u2019re racist for asking you to comment about racism at a football match, an issue you\u2019ve spoken about so many times?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Get a grip, Stan \u2013 you sound absurd.\u2019\n\nPiers Morgan hit back at Stan\u2019s claims (Picture: Twitter)\n\nLast night\u2019s England vs Bulgaria game was halted twice by referee Ivan Bebek during the first half, with the PA announcer telling Bulgaria fans that the match was in danger of being abandoned if their monkey chanting and Nazi salutes continued.\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate told ITV Sport: \u2018I have to say that the officials were onto everything very quickly.\n\n\u2018We reported everything immediately when we heard things. We had constant communication with the officials and referee and I was in contact with the players during the first half in particular and then again at half-time.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s an unacceptable situation. I think we\u2019ve made two statements really by winning the game but also we have raised the awareness of everybody to the situation.\n\n\u2018The game was stopped twice and I know for some people that won\u2019t be enough. But I think we as a group were on board with that process.\u2019\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted Good Morning Britain for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
