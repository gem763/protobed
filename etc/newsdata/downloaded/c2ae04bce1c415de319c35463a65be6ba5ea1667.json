Or worse. None of what they\u2019re saying happened in that phone call!\u201d\n\nLimbaugh then took aim at Fox News, complaining that there are \u201cNever Trumpers all over\u201d the network, mocking those at Fox who have said the call is hard to defend or inappropriate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing hard to defend about the phone call,\u201d the radio host yelled. \u201cYou just don\u2019t want to defend it! You know, Fox really ought to change the name of the network from the Fox News Channel to the Fox Never Trumper Network! Because that\u2019s who\u2019s getting the highlights, and they\u2019re bringing in Democrats like Donna Brazile!\u201d\n\nIn the wake of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s announcement last week that the House Democrats were pursuing an impeachment inquiry, there have been several notable on-air scuffles between Trump-supporting Fox News hosts and Fox anchors and analysts.\n\nAnchor Shep Smith, for instance, took issue with primetime host Tucker Carlson allowing Trump-defending guest Joe diGenova to call Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano \u201ca fool\u201d unchallenged, prompting Carlson to return fire by mocking Smith while suggesting he\u2019s a \u201cpartisan opinion host.\u201d", "description": "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing hard to defend about the phone call,\u201d the radio host yelled. \u201cYou just don\u2019t want to defend it!\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1971,w_3504,x_0,y_271/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570052343/RTR1ESGV_mtqcnl"}
