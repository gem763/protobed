And those numbers don\u2019t include all of those sick puppies laid up with the virus who didn\u2019t go see a doctor.\n\nAnd the year before was the deadliest flu season in more than four decades, with 80,000 deaths caused by the flu in the U.S., including 180 children, according to the CDC. And that came on the tails of Australia\u2019s worst flu outbreak in two decades.\n\nIn fact, Australia\u2019s flu seasons have sometimes predicted those in America. So considering Australia just had an unusually early and severe flu season, as the New York Times reported, U.S. health professionals are bracing for the virus to come back with a vengeance for winter 2019-2020.\n\nFlu season begins in October, with flu activity peaking between December and February, so now is the time to get ahead in protecting yourself and your family. The average household spends $338 on over-the-counter medications every year, which ramps up during cold and flu season, and $328 billion on prescription retail drugs available at pharmacies. But before you start banking on supposed cure-alls like supplements, fortified lozenges and Cold-EEZE \u2014 or worse, skipping the flu shot like more than 40% of Americans \u2014 read up on these scientifically proven preventatives and treatments that doctors and registered dietitians prescribed to MarketWatch.\n\nBEFORE YOU GET SICK\n\nDo:\n\nGet your flu shot. Don\u2019t let reports of some seasons having somewhat ineffective vaccines put you off. (For example, the 2017-2018 vaccine\u2019s efficacy rate was just about 36%, which means it cut flu-related doctors visits by that amount.) The CDC still recommends you get it, because the vaccine can still lower your risk of complications or dying from the flu even if you do get sick. Don\u2019t delay, as Dr. Keith Roach, physician at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, told MarketWatch that it takes two weeks for the vaccine to work. \u201cThere\u2019s some benefit, and it\u2019s usually free, since it\u2019s covered by insurance, so the value that you get for the cost is infinite,\u201d he said. If you\u2019re uninsured, the shots run between $40 and $60 at drugstores like CVS, Walmart and Target, or those with Costco or Sam\u2019s Club memberships can get jabbed for just $20 or $30. You can also find health centers near you, or look up your state's vaccine offerings, at Vaccines.gov.\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto Get your flu shot, health professionals say.\n\nStock up on hand sanitizer and antibacterial wipes. \u201cThe main way we get the flu is through personal contact,\u201d explained Dr. Roach, \u201cor touching something that a person with the flu has already touched \u2014 which, in a city or an office, can mean practically anything.\u201d You should wash your hands frequently, especially after shaking hands with someone or grabbing a doorknob, but in a pinch, Dr. Roach said that swiping your hands or cleaning your desk or phone with cleaning wipes (just $1 or less for travel-size sanitizer and $5 and up for wipes) is \u201cstill worth doing.\u201d\n\nEat orange fruits and veggies, plus shellfish and greens. While there\u2019s scant evidence to support supplements, there is research to support that getting immune-boosting vitamins and minerals from whole foods is important for holistic health. \u201cZinc and vitamin C are both involved in the body\u2019s response to infection and are utilized by the cells of the immune system,\u201d said Tanya Zuckerbrot, a registered dietitian and best-selling of author \u201cThe F-Factor Diet,\u201d who recommends fortifying yourself with sweet yellow peppers and red peppers, kale and broccoli for vitamin C, and oysters, lean lamb and beef, spinach and mushrooms for zinc.\n\nGet plenty of sleep. \u201cSleep is actually more important than diet,\u201d said Dr. Roach, pointing to research showing your immune system releases proteins called cytokines in your sleep, which are needed to fight infections and inflammation. So not catching enough Zs suppresses your immune system \u2014 which makes you more likely to catch a cold or the flu if you come in contact with it.\n\nExercise. Breaking a sweat doesn\u2019t just make your muscles stronger \u2014 it also pumps up your immune system. A 2010 study found that regular exercises nearly halved their risk of catching cold viruses, and those who still got sick suffered less severe symptoms. \u201cExercise will absolutely boost the immune system, even into the day after you exercise,\u201d said Dr. Roach.\n\nDon\u2019t:\n\nLoad up on supplements and zinc lozenges. \u201cIt\u2019s all snake oil,\u201d said Dr. Roach \u2014 and that goes for effervescent vitamin C megadoses (familiar ones include Airborne and Emergen-C that run $7 to $13) and lozenges fortified with zinc ($5 to $10). Consumer Reports reported that Americans spent $35 billion on dietary supplements in 2015 alone \u2014 even though manufacturers don\u2019t have to prove to the Food and Drug Administration that their products are effective or even safe. \u201cThere is no good data that shows they are effective,\u201d said Dr. Roach.\n\nIF YOU\u2019RE SICK\n\nDo:\n\nSee a doctor as soon as you experience symptoms. You want to be prescribed an antiviral flu medication like Tamiful GSK, -0.65% or Roche RHHBY, -1.40% ($50 to $130, often covered by insurance) as soon as possible, which can reduce the time that you\u2019re sick from half a day to two days. \u201cEven one less sick day is a huge monetary incentive for someone,\u201d said Dr. Roach. \u201cThis isn\u2019t walking around with a box of tissues \u2014 the flu is lying in bed wishing you were dead. The muscle aches feel like you were hit by a truck. So by all means, see a doctor and get an anti-flu medication at the earliest possible onset of symptoms, which include the sudden onset of muscle aches, fever, headache and often some upper respiratory symptoms such as a runny nose, cough or sore throat.\u201d\n\nUse over-the-counter meds to ease specific symptoms. But don\u2019t grab just any cold medicine just for the sake of throwing something else at the flu. Dr. Roach recommends tailoring your medications to your ailments, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) for the muscle aches, suphedrine (Sudafed) for stuffy noses, and dextromethorphan (Robitussin) for coughs, or combination drugs (DayQuil/NyQuil PG, -1.25% or Tylenol Cold + Flu JNJ, -1.05% ) to treat multiple symptoms. \u201cBut don\u2019t take something if you don\u2019t need it,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of these can make you feel wired, raise your heart rate or give you dry mouth.\"\n\nSlurp chicken soup. \u201cThere really is something to chicken soup,\u201d said Dr. Roach. \u201cStudies have found that viral shedding actually is decreased when you have chicken soup, compared with just hot water.\u201d Nutritionist and registered dietitian Keri Glassman also suggests throwing some Cordyceps mushrooms into your soup, \u201cwhich are antibacterial and are also known to be effective in fighting off viral infections,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd add in garlic and onion \u2014 not just for flavor, but for a dose of antiseptic and immunity-boosting compounds.\u201d\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto Doctors shared their tried and tested flu remedies \u2014 like chicken soup.\n\nSip plenty of clear fluids. When you are febrile in the throes of the flu, you tend to sweat and breathe with you mouth open, so you often lose a lot more fluid than you realize. Drink enough clear fluids (like water or tea) so that you\u2019re urinating every few hours, and the urine isn\u2019t dark and concentrated. And steep yourself in hot tea with honey. \u201cHoney is a cure-all for so many things because of its antimicrobial and antioxidant properties,\u201d said Glassman. \u201cAnd it\u2019s also good for coating a sore throat and helping you feel better.\u201d\n\nUse hot showers and vaporizers to decongest. Getting some steam won\u2019t make you better any faster, but it can help you breathe more easily. \u201cThe steam helps you get rid of the mucous lining your airways, which can make it difficult and uncomfortable to breathe,\u201d said Dr. Roach. \u201cI tell people to get into a shower as hot as they can stand, and breathe the steam in and out as much as they can through their nasal passages.\u201d Then cough, sneeze and blow your nose for 10 minutes after your sauna. And a humidifier can also soothe dry and cracked nasal passages. Plus, dry air helps the flu virus live longer, so aim to keep the humidity in your room at 30% to 50%.\n\nDon\u2019t:\n\nTry working through it. \u201cEvery person with the flu on average infects another three people, and one of the people you infect might be somebody who could get in big trouble with it,\u201d said Dr. Roach, including young children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with chronic health conditions. \u201cBetween 12,000 and 56,000 people die from the flu every year. So stay at home. Don\u2019t go infecting those other three people. It will be better for you and a whole lot better for the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nRely on homeopathic remedies. Don\u2019t trust any over-the-counter remedy that promises to cure the flu itself, as opposed to treating symptoms. \u201cThese remedies have no active medications in them, and so they aren\u2019t going to work beyond a placebo effect,\u201d said Dr. Roach. \u201cThere are some herbal remedies out there that might be beneficial, but just haven\u2019t been proven yet; but nonetheless, I\u2019d recommend that people save their money and use proven treatments.\"\n\nThis article was originally published in February 2018, and has been updated with new CDC data for winter 2019-2020.", "description": "Get your flu shot, snag a Tamiflu prescription and stock up on chicken soup -- but don\u2019t waste money on supplements and zinc lozenges, experts say", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS866_flu_ZG_20191008105824.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-30"}
