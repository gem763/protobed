Hopes of a rate cut and optimism around trade talks had pushed the benchmark S&P 500 to record highs in the last two sessions.\n\n\"The (rate) cut expected today is largely baked in but the question is if the Fed uses this as an opportunity to pause and assess whether the easing that has taken place has had the desired effect,\" said Mike Loewengart, vice president, investment strategy at E*TRADE Financial Corp.\n\n\"All indications are that they have. So it would not be surprising to see the Fed taking a pause from this point,\" Loewengart added.\n\nA Commerce Department report showed U.S. economic growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter as declining business investment was offset by resilient consumer spending and a rebound in exports, further allaying financial market fears of a recession.\n\nMore than half of the S&P 500 companies have posted quarterly results so far, of which 74.1% have beaten profit estimates.

FDA said it stands by its finding.\n\nMattel Inc surged nearly 18% after the U.S. toymaker reported a surprise jump in quarterly revenue on higher demand for newer models of its flagship Barbie brand and dolls based on Korean pop-sensation BTS.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.46-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.60-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded six new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 39 new highs and 40 new lows.
