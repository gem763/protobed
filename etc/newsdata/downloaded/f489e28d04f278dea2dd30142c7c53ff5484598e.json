She dresses as a princess or a doctor or a YouTuber (yes, really).\n\nOur daughter Elizabeth who is five years old always dresses with a mask at Halloween. A skeleton mask, a cat mask, a Minnie Mouse mask.\n\nThis could be perfectly normal, or it could be because Elizabeth has a facial disfigurement.\n\nAt six months old Elizabeth was severely burnt in a house fire while sleeping in her cot. Now, at five years old she has realised she does not look the same as the children in her class.\n\nShe knows now why she is stared at everywhere she goes. It isn\u2019t because she is wearing a pretty dress, or because they like her teddy bear, as we have been telling her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s because she has no hair and only one ear and because her face has been skin grafted. Now she is old enough to realise.\n\nThis week a boy asked her if she was a zombie. When she was a baby, small enough to be in a buggy, a passing man said to us, \u2018at least she won\u2019t have to wear a mask at Halloween\u2019.\n\nIt seems that now she feels that she does.\n\nPeople, adults, have called her scary. Children have said she looks \u2018freaky\u2019.\n\nTeenage boys have pointed at her and sniggered among themselves. Elderly ladies have looked horrified at her.\n\nWe have no doubt that Elizabeth knows what people think about how she looks and we know that at Halloween, when all the other kids are trying to look \u2018scary\u2019 she just wants to look as normal as them.\n\nScars and disfigurements do not make you look scary, evil or bad. They are the signs of a survivor.\n\nIt is a stain on our society that so many find those with facial disfigurements scary or ugly or less than themselves.\n\nThat is what is ugly, those parents who allow their children to grow up thinking that it is OK to consider those who look different as weird or freaky and that it\u2019s OK to stare at them or comment or push them away.\n\nScars and disfigurements do not make you look scary, evil or bad. They are the signs of a survivor.\n\nThey show that something happened to that person and they got through it, they overcame it, they beat it. They are to be admired as the heroes, not ostracised as villains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s why we are working with the charity Changing Faces to change attitudes and behaviour towards people like Elizabeth who have a scar, mark or condition that makes them look different.\n\nA passing man told us that Elizabeth won\u2019t have to wear a mask at Halloween (Picture: Getty)\n\nIt is a testament to the skill and dedication of the surgeons and medical staff at Birmingham Children\u2019s Hospital who put our daughter back together that she can move the muscles and skin on her face.\n\nIt is nothing short of a miracle that a smile can still spread across her face, and that it can continue onto the faces of those around her and through a whole room.\n\nIt is amazing that she can frown in concentration as she tries to button her top with two remaining fingers, and that she can express how little she needs your help with one angry look.\n\nThough her captivating smile and infectious laugh are precious \u2013 they are not for everyone.\n\nThose who judge her based on a quick glance and can\u2019t spare the time to meet her don\u2019t deserve that smile.\n\nSo, at Halloween, they will see the mask that Elizabeth chooses, and they can continue on with their lives in the belief that what we look like on the outside somehow tells them who we are. Those of us who are privileged to have met Elizabeth know different.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElizabeth and her parents Sinead and Liam are ambassadors for Changing Faces, the UK\u2019s leading charity for anyone with a scar, mark of condition that makes them look different.\n\nIf you need some advice or support please get in touch at www.changingfaces.org.uk or call 0300 012 0275.\n\nMORE: Mum praised for sharing photo that sums up the reality of parenting\n\nMORE: Paddy McGuinness reveals struggle of parenting twins with autism: \u2018We can\u2019t go on family holidays\u2019\n\nMORE: Geri Horner refuses to spoil her kids as she reveals parenting mantra: \u2018I hate self-entitlement, it\u2019s ugly\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Our 10-year-old daughter Amelia never wears a mask at Halloween.
