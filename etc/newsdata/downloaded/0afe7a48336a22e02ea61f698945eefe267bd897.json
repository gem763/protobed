It was the forward\u2019s first goal in open play since the opening weekend of the season and United looked on course to record just their third league win of the season against the league leaders.\n\nBut United once again paid for their failure to find a second goal and Adam Lallana struck five minutes from time to maintain Liverpool\u2019s unbeaten start to the season. It was a hammer blow to United, who sit just two points above the relegation zone with a quarter of the campaign played.\n\nRashford scored his second goal of the season from open play (Picture: Getty)\n\nNevertheless, Solskjaer was delighted with the display and sources have told Metro.co.uk that the Norwegian stressed in the dressing room afterwards that the performance was a blueprint for how he wants them to play moving forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolskjaer knew Liverpool would crave possession more than United, something his side have rarely encountered so far this term. This convinced Solskjaer to move to a back three to accommodate the impressive Axel Tuanzebe but the defender pulled up in the warm-up and was replaced by Marcos Rojo.\n\nLiverpool struggled to create clear chances and Solskjaer was once again delighted with his side\u2019s solidity. He feels the improvements made at the back have been overshadowed by problems up front so far this term but it was a rare occasion this season in which both ends of the pitch have worked effectively.\n\nThe Norwegian was under pressure heading into the game and there was even speculation that a heavy defeat could end his short reign at Old Trafford. But Solskjaer went round the dressing room and shook the hand of every individual player, thanking them for \u2018giving everything\u2019. Solskjaer stressed that he wants to see that type of intensity in every match, no matter who the opposition is and said they would rapidly climb the table if they can maintain that level.\n\nThe likes of Ashley Young and Victor Lindelof were slumped on the pitch at full-time, feeling \u2013 not for the first time this season \u2013 that United had squandered another victory. But Solskjaer\u2019s tone was largely positive afterwards and he was wary not to focus too much on the negatives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolskjaer is acutely aware that the pressure will not alleviate until United climb the table and their next four matches in all competitions are away from home. Their last victory on the road was in February.\n\nBut at the very least the draw should buy Solskjaer more time as he bids to win over minds as well as hearts at Old Trafford.\n\nMORE: Ed Woodward speaks out on Manchester United\u2019s transfer link with Bruno Fernandes", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was buoyed by his side's display in their draw with Liverpool and said they must use the performance as a springboard for turning their season around.
