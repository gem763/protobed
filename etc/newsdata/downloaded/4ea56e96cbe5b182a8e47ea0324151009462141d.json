Brian Kemp bans abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can happen as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women realize they\u2019re expecting. It allows for limited exceptions.\n\nIt had been scheduled to become enforceable on Jan. 1.\n\nLawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood and the Center for Reproductive Rights in June filed a constitutional challenge to the law on behalf of Georgia abortion providers and an advocacy group.\n\nU.S. District Judge Steve Jones wrote in an order Tuesday that the current laws governing abortion in the state shall remain in effect for the time being.\n\nKemp\u2019s office had no immediate comment on the ruling, spokesman Cody Hall said.\n\n\u201cToday is a tremendous victory for the women of Georgia and for the Constitution,\u201d ACLU of Georgia legal director Sean Young said. \u201cPoliticians have no business telling women or couples when to start or expand a family. This case has always been about one thing: Letting her decide.\u201d\n\nThe law makes exceptions in the case of rape and incest, as long as the woman files a police report first. It also allows for abortions when the life of the woman is at risk or when a fetus is determined not to be viable because of a serious medical condition.\n\nAdditionally, it declares an embryo or fetus a \u201cnatural person\u201d once cardiac activity can be detected, saying that is the point where \u201cthe full value of a child begins.\u201d That would make the fetus a dependent minor for tax purposes and trigger child support obligations.\n\nThe so-called heartbeat law is one of a wave of laws passed recently by Republican-controlled legislatures in an attack on the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.\n\nNone of the bans has taken effect. Some have already been blocked, and elsewhere courts are considering requests to put them on hold while legal challenges play out.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked Georgia's restrictive new abortion law from taking effect, following the lead of other judges who have blocked similar measures in other states.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kate Brumback"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/abortion-georgia_21554_c0-75-5407-3227_s1770x1032.jpg?121cd97dad5ee93d7fd5719fa96d2fa845c83aed"}
