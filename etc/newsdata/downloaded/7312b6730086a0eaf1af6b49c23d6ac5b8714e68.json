In the alternative, there is no standing by either Plaintiff due to the illegal alien status of Lopez at the time of his death in tandem with his insufficient connections with the United States of the type, dignity, and caliber required for standing,\" the motion states.\n\nWells told ABC News that he was \"pretty disgusted\" by the claim.\n\n\"It\u2019s also repugnant. The idea that she's going to interpret the constitution in a way that excludes non-citizen residents flies in the face of the whole purpose of the due process and the Constitution,\" Wells said.\n\nCourt documents show that the city\u2019s legal team pointed to two prior deportations where Lopez was sent to Mexico, alleged he had prior arrests and said he had an outstanding warrant, all as part of their case arguing that he would not be entitled to Constitutional protections.\n\nThe attorney for Southaven did not immediately respond to ABC News\u2019 requests for comment.\n\nLinares and the representative for Lopez\u2019s estate filed a civil rights claim in June seeking $20 million in damages for his wrongful death.\n\nCourtesy of Murray Wells\n\nWells said that he could not confirm any of the alleged arrests or deportations, noting how he did not meet Lopez before his death, but said that should any such records exist that would not preclude someone from having Constitutional rights. He said that the decision made by the district court would have implications beyond this individual case, however.\n\n\"When a door gets opened just a little bit, there are people who will step through. I also think it emboldens people who may harbor hate or resentment to undocumented residents and believe now that they have the authority to violate their rights because they have none and that's the really really scary thing about this,\" Wells said. \"If this one slips through the cracks somehow, it is a chilling erosion on our Constitution, and I think there are people in today's climate who would want that.\"\n\nRepresentatives for the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union agree.\n\n\"It is well-settled and long-standing law that all persons in the United States, including undocumented immigrants, have the protections of the U.S. Constitution including the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s right to equal protection and the Fourth Amendment\u2019s right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures,\" Joshua Tom, Legal Director and Interim Director of the ACLU of Mississippi, said in a statement to ABC News.\n\n\"This fact is uncontroversial, and any statement to the contrary is simply wrong. Southaven\u2019s argument has no basis in existing law and is frivolous and potentially sanctionable under federal rules of procedure. We urge the City of Southaven to uphold our country\u2019s laws,\" Tom said.", "description": "The legal drama is playing out in Mississippi following the July 27, 2017, shooting death of Ismael Lopez.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/lopez-ht-er-190930_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
