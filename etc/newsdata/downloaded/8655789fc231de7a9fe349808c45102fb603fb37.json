[\u2026] It made the first few years as a model easier,\u2019 she told Wonderland Magazine.\n\nShe\u2019s got good Instagram game\n\nNot that we\u2019d expect anything less from a 22-year-old actress and model, but Maddison is very good at Instagram.\n\nDocumenting her life for her 450,000 followers, her feed is a tasteful mix of fashion shoots, selfies and partying with her friends, while letting her personality shine through with some political slogans and banter with her friends.\n\nOh, and dogs. Lots of cute dogs.\n\nShe looks a lot like Bella Thorne\n\nIf the comment sections below Maddison\u2019s pictures tell us anything, it\u2019s that everyone thinks she looks like Bella Thorne.\n\nTBH, we can see it; the red hair, pale skin, model good looks.\n\nWho knows, maybe dating Liam could lead the pair to meet?
