Not around for the end of the game was star outfielder Bryce Harper or manager Gabe Kapler, thanks to a wonderfully petty series of events.\n\nBryce Harper ejected in costly loss for Phillies\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe $330 million man was rung up in the fourth inning after home-plate umpire Gabe Morales punched him out on a fastball that looked clearly inside. Thing is, Harper\u2019s ejection didn\u2019t come after an argument immediately following the call.\n\nNo, Harper had to double-check something before he was ready to completely call out Morales.\n\nFrom MLB.com\u2019s Mark Feinsand:\n\n\u201cI disagreed with that call, kind of looked back at him and said, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s not a strike,\u2019\u201d Harper said. \u201cHe kind of looked at me like, \u2018Yeah, all right, stupid.\u2019 Just that look. I went back and thought, \u2018Maybe he\u2019s right.\u2019\u201d Harper raced back to the video room to take another look, but the video only reinforced his belief that Morales had blown the call. Harper returned to the dugout during Rhys Hoskins\u2019 at-bat, during which he barked toward the plate, \u201cNot even [expletive] close,\u201d prompting Morales to eject him immediately.\n\nFew sequences can capture Bryce Harper\u2019s energy as much as that.\n\nAn incensed Kapler was then ejected after giving Morales a piece of his mind.\n\nBryce Harper's day ended early Sunday. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)\n\nHarper was unsurprisingly unamused by the incident after the game, saying Morales simply needs to be better at his job:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cEspecially in these games right now, you have to be better back there,\u201d Harper said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be better. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re not going to make mistakes; I miss heaters down the middle, too. It\u2019s part of it. Just in these games right now, you have to be better.\u201d\n\nIt was a tough day overall for the 76-72 Phillies, who lost a game in the wild-card standings due to the Chicago Cubs\u2019 16-6 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. They had only a 2.1 percent chance of making the playoffs entering Sunday, according to Baseball Prospectus, and might have lost a solid chunk of that.\n\nIf they want to mount some kind of miracle run, a hot streak from Harper is probably one of the best ways to do it. They just need him in for the whole game to make that possible\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Phillies' high-priced outfielder was not happy with a third-strike call against the Red Sox.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VC2ms3_tZL4m1clBnPZLMQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UgTUrgKluYgnHmdz5Ja4SA--~B/aD0xNzI0O3c9MjU4NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/811bd8f0-d82b-11e9-bf9e-d2002672f446", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
