I don\u2019t think you need them,\u201d he told British media.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d played the fortnight before and tweaked my knee in a game, then I played on an artificial pitch the following week and probably playing on an injury didn\u2019t help.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got pitch covers, indoor stadiums... employ more groundsmen. It might be suited to under-10s or under-12s... great for the community, but I\u2019m talking about our (professional) game, it\u2019s not suited.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand-born Hartley said he was still recovering from the disappointment of being left out of Eddie Jones\u2019s 31-man squad for the World Cup in Japan.\n\n\u201cWhen the World Cup squad was announced, it was almost like I\u2019d died. Friends getting in touch and seeing if I was OK,\u201d Hartley, who has 97 England caps, added.\n\n\u201cThe way I looked at my whole rugby career and how I wanted it to pan out, was that this would have been the ultimate send-off, the dream finish. The reality is you pick up an injury.\n\n\u201cFor four years we have talked about winning the World Cup with Eddie and I have led that group... so to fall at the final hurdle... I wake up most nights thinking about it. It doesn\u2019t sit well with me but I have come to terms with it.\u201d\n\nEngland begin their World Cup campaign against Tonga on Sept. 22 before games against the United States, Argentina and France.", "description": "Former England captain Dylan Hartley blamed artificial pitches for a knee injury that cost him a place in the Rugby World Cup squad and called them unsuitable for the professional game.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428917440&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B05T", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
