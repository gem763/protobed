And while I'm a die-hard Reese's Cup fan (it's the best candy, end of story), a recent survey revealed that your trick-or-treat preferences could actually depend on where you live.\n\nCandyStore.com examined 12 years of sales data to determine the most popular Halloween candy in every state. From Twix up in Alaska to Skittles down in Florida, people's tastes were different state to state. But some candies still reigned supreme\u2014the candy retailer also reported the top Halloween candy for the entire U.S. Skittles came in first, followed by Reese's Cups, M&Ms, Snickers, and Starbursts.\n\nBelow are the results for each state, along with how to get your hands on your favorite sweet treat before October 31.\n\nThe state-by-state breakdown\n\nCredit: Tetiana Chudovska/Getty Images Are you more of a sweet or sour person?\n\nAlabama: Hershey's Minis\n\nAlaska: Twix\n\nArizona: Hot Tamales\n\nArkansas: Skittles\n\nCalifornia: Skittles\n\nColorado: Twix\n\nConnecticut: Milky Way\n\nDelaware: Skittles\n\nFlorida: Skittles\n\nGeorgia: Jolly Ranchers\n\nHawaii: Skittles\n\nIdaho: Candy Corn\n\nIllinois: Kit Kat\n\nIndiana: Hot Tamales\n\nIowa: Candy Corn\n\nKansas: Reese's Cups\n\nKentucky: Swedish Fish\n\nLouisiana: Lemonheads\n\nMaine: Sour Patch Kids\n\nMaryland: Reese's Cups\n\nMassachusetts: Butterfinger\n\nMichigan: Starburst\n\nMinnesota: Skittles\n\nMississippi: Snickers\n\nMissouri: Milky Way\n\nMontana: Dubble Bubble\n\nNebraska: Salt Water Taffy\n\nNevada: Candy Corn\n\nNew Hampshire: Starburst\n\nNew Jersey: Tootsie Pops\n\nNew Mexico: Candy Corn\n\nNew York: Hot Tamales\n\nNorth Carolina: Reese's Cups\n\nNorth Dakota: Candy Corn\n\nOhio: M&Ms\n\nOklahoma: Dubble Bubble\n\nOregon: Reese's Cups\n\nPennsylvania: Hershey's Minis\n\nRhode Island: Twix\n\nSouth Carolina: Skittles\n\nSouth Dakota: Starburst\n\nTennessee: Tootsie Pops\n\nTexas: Reese's Cups\n\nUtah: Jolly Ranchers\n\nVermont: M&Ms\n\nVirginia: Hot Tamales\n\nWashington: Salt Water Taffy\n\nWest Virginia: Blow Pops\n\nWisconsin: Starburst\n\nWyoming: Salt Water Taffy\n\nWhen is the best time to buy Halloween candy?\n\nWhile the post-Halloween sales are a no-brainer, if you want to stock up on candy prior to Fright Night, experts recommend buying it four days before Halloween. In 2018, that's when the median cost was its lowest at $1.94 per unit.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhatever you do, don't wait until the day before\u2014according to sales data, on October 30, the median cost jumped 80 cents up to $2.75 per unit.
