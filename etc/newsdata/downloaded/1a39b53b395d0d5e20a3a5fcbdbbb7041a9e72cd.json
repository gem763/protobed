In addition to sanctioning Mr. Seif last year, the Treasury Department reimposed sanctions related to purchases of American dollars by the Iranian government, which had been suspended as part of an international nuclear accord.\n\nThe new sanctions to the central bank are an additional layer over what the United States has already levied, said Ryan Fayhee, a partner at Hughes Hubbard and Reed who heads the firm\u2019s sanctions, export controls and anti-money laundering practice. The impact of the new sanctions on the development fund, Mr. Fayhee said, depends on how active or well-funded it is. If the fund has access to oil revenues, he said, the sanctions could have an impact. He said the extent of central bank interest and property in the United States is not known.", "description": "The sanctions targeting the Iranian national bank add to the pressure on Iran, which the United States accuses of attacking Saudi oil facilities.", "authors": ["Eileen Sullivan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/20/us/politics/20dc-prexy/20dc-prexy-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
