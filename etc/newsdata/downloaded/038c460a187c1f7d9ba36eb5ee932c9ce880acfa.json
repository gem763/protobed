Kraft is still awaiting trial, but NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said at the league owners meetings in March that he wouldn\u2019t make any determinations until all the facts had been gathered. About Roethlisberger, Brown tweeted, \u201c4 games for Big Ben crazy world I'm done with it.\u201d Of Kraft, he said: \"Kraft got caught in the parlor AB speculations fired different strokes different folks clearly.\u201d (He later deleted both comments.)\n\nIt\u2019s certainly true that NFL players often don\u2019t get the same benefit of the doubt in criminal cases that Kraft did. As was the case with Roethlisberger, the NFL has shown that it doesn\u2019t need a conviction to punish a player. Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott was suspended six games in 2017 after being accused of domestic violence, despite a lengthy legal battle over the credibility of those accusations.\n\nWhat Brown didn\u2019t acknowledge is that he himself is the latest example of the lengths the league will go through to excuse or overlook allegations of predatory behavior toward women. Even though, on September 10, his former athletic trainer, Britney Taylor, filed a civil suit accusing him of rape, Brown still played in the Patriots 43-0 blowout of the Miami Dolphins a few days later.\n\nBrown is wrong about about a double standard in this sense: NFL teams and the league office definitely have a consistent way of addressing violence against women. Talented players get multiple opportunities to succeed professionally; the league gets involved only as much as it needs to protect its image.\n\nHad Brown not self-destructed in so spectacular a fashion, he likely would still have a job and maybe even played in the Patriots decisive 30-14 win over the New York Jets on Sunday. The fact that he had been accused of rape by one woman, and sexual misconduct by another would not, on its own, have been enough to keep him off the field. Last Monday, the NFL reportedly met with accuser Britney Taylor, a former athletic trainer who accused Brown in a civil suit of sexually assaulting her multiple times.\n\nLast week, Sports Illustrated published a damning piece in which an unnamed female artist claimed that Brown, who had hired her to paint a mural at his home, approached her from behind with just a hand towel over his genitals. When she ignored him, reporter Robert Klemko\u2019s story alleged, Brown failed to pay her for her work. New England, according to Klemko, had told Brown not to have any contact with his accuser. When the artist received threatening texts after the Sports Illustrated story was published, that was it for the Patriots\u2019 newest receiver.", "description": "Pro football can look past allegations of predatory behavior toward women, but making the NFL look bad is a different story.", "authors": ["Jemele Hill", "Staff Writer For"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_1175037519/facebook.jpg?1569244916", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
