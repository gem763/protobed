After arresting the younger Guzman, who is wanted in the U.S. on drug trafficking charges, Mexican authorities released him after his allies unleashed terror in Culiacan.\n\nThe cartel gunmen quickly overpowered security and military forces while kidnapping soldiers and threatening to murder military families as leverage for the release of Ovidio.\n\n\u201cStop everything, stop everything\u2013I turned myself in,\u201d the younger Guzman says in the video. \u201cI don\u2019t want any more trouble please.\u201d\n\nDespite the call, gunmen continued to pressure the federal government until they released the Guzman heir. While claiming he did not give the order, AMLO publicly said he supports the decision made by his staff since it was intended to save lives.\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.
