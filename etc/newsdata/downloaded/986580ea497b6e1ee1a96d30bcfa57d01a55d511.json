I mean the People's Vote campaign is five different organisations.\n\n'He is non-executive chairman of one, I think the outgoing executive chairman of one.\n\n'And he's making a mistake that I think a lot of businessmen do when they dabble in politics, which is to think that because they had a certain title on a board that they then own the campaign.'\n\nPresser further on whether Mr Rudd sacked him, Mr Baldwin said: 'He technically controls my contract but he didn't appoint me. He doesn't pay me.'\n\nMr Baldwin said he planned to go into work on Monday morning.\n\nMr Rudd later told the programme: 'Listen, there's no row about where we stand. We all want another vote.'\n\nAsked if Mr Baldwin is still welcome within the campaign, Mr Rudd - the brother of former Tory cabinet minister Amber Rudd - said he has 'an opportunity for a different type of role'.\n\nMr Rudd added: 'I want to make clear, there's no row about the remain side and PV. Everyone knows where we stand on this.'\n\nMr Baldwin said: 'It doesn't seem to be the best week to be putting a wrecking ball through the campaign, demoralising staff, and demoralising all the activists, the thousands and thousands of activists who paid for our campaign, the millions of people who support us out there in the country.'\n\nHe said the People's Vote campaign 'belongs to the people, not just one businessman', adding: 'It's really not for him to tell the campaign what to do I'm afraid today, particularly in a week as crucial as this one.'", "description": "Staff at the People's Vote staged a walk out this morning over an attempt to fire two senior\u00a0figures in the movement,James McGrory and Tom Baldwin,  in a power struggle.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/11/20276424-0-image-a-22_1572263435455.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
