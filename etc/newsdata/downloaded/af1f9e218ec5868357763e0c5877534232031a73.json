The Redskins will either start Colt McCoy, Case Keenum or Dwayne Haskins, but the team is keeping its choice under wraps for now.\n\nIf the decision is being kept a secret in part to try and give the Redskins an advantage, Belichick isn\u2019t falling for it.\n\nThe Patriots coach said Tuesday his team is preparing for all three Redskins quarterbacks.\n\n\u201cThey all are pretty good,\u201d Belichick said on a conference call. \u201cObviously, McCoy is an outstanding player with a great deal of experience and so is Case and those guys have played a lot of good football and they have a very talented group of skill players with them. Haskins is a young, talented player with good size and can move, a big strong guy in the pocket, and great arm.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to get ready for all three players and that\u2019ll be a big challenge for us.\u201d\n\nYes, Belichick actually said the Redskins pose a \u201cbig challenge.\u201d Please don\u2019t laugh.\n\nBelichick added the Redskins\u2019 record doesn\u2019t matter, praising Gruden for a \u201cwell-designed\u201d offense. The two teams held joint practice sessions together in 2014, when the Patriots spent three days in Richmond before the teams met in the preseason. Belichick said, since then, the Redskins\u2019 offense is still \u201cvery much in coach Gruden\u2019s philosophy and background.\u201d\n\nThis season, the Redskins have struggled to move the ball, especially in the last two weeks. Washington put up 15 points against the Chicago Bears and only 3 against the New York Giants. As a whole, the Redskins rank 28th in offense (296.2 yards per game) and points (16.2 per game).\n\nBut Belichick said the Redskins have \u201cvery good\u201d skill players and play designs that get players open.\n\n\u201c(Gruden) does a great job of game-planning and creating problems for the defense, and they have very good skill players to get the ball to,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cI think that\u2019s really what they want to be offensively with a balanced running game. There\u2019s a lot of balance in offense between the run and pass \u2013\u2014I mean, there have been a couple situations where they\u2019ve been behind and that got skewed a little bit, but generally speaking it\u2019s a well-balanced offense. It makes you defend everything, the running game, the play-action game, the quick throws, the screens and the vertical passing game where they\u2019ve hit a number of big plays and had other guys open that just didn\u2019t connect.\n\n\u201cCoach Gruden does a good job springing those guys free and getting them vertically into the defense for potential big plays.\u201d\n\nBelichick\u2019s praise isn\u2019t out of the ordinary. The eight-time Super Bowl champion (six as a head coach) is routinely complimentary of opponents, no matter how big of underdogs they might be.\n\nLikewise, Gruden has respect for Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing the best quarterback in NFL history this week,\u201d Gruden said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
