Fox News has made several decisions in the last several months that some historic viewers see as a clear fundamental direction change.\"\n\nNewsmax boss Chris Ruddy also played ball, touting his network's reach and taking a dig at the Goliath of the conservative news world. \"There is a growing disenchantment with Fox News and we are definitely seeing a rise in viewership with Newsmax,\" he said.\n\nTo be sure, Fox is still the top-rated channel in cable news. What's unclear, as always, is whether the president actually wants his fans to stop watching Fox and switch to something else. Trump is still enamored with the network's opinion hosts, including Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Tucker Carlson and Jeanine Pirro. (A company spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\n\"He's essentially asking for a boycott,\" said Cameron, who was part of the news side and recently launched a digital news site called Front Page Live. \"Anybody who predicts whether Trump's gonna stick to what he says \u2014 that's a losing gambit.\"\n\nAnother Fox News veteran, Democratic strategist and former contributor Julie Roginsky, isn't exactly buying the president's animus. \"Trump will never abandon Fox News, because no other network has the ability to reach Republican base voters the way Fox does,\" she said. \"It is an idle threat to keep Fox in line, and it is a threat that may work, although Fox suddenly has other tools at its disposal to keep him in line as well.\"\n\nAs usual, the president's attack was spurred on by something he saw on Fox News \u2014 in this case, a news-side interview with Democratic National Committee communications chief Xochitl Hinojosa. \"While it\u2019s laughable that Trump is now in a fight with Fox News, the troubling part is that the president of the United States chooses to watch TV and tweet over doing his job,\" she said.\n\nRoginsky said that Trump's entanglement with Fox News would be different under the late Roger Ailes. \"Trump might have watched Fox suddenly provide significant air time to Joe Walsh as a warning that the network is not to be trifled with,\" she said.", "description": "President Donald Trump turned up the pressure on Fox News Channel on Wednesday, telling his 63 million followers on Twitter that \"we have to start looking for a new News Outlet\" because \"Fox isn\u2019t working for us anymore!\"", "authors": ["Jeremy Barr", "Jeremy.Barr Thr.Com"], "top_image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2019/08/donald_trump_-_fox_news_ceo_suzanne_scott_-_getty_-_split_-_h_2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-28"}
