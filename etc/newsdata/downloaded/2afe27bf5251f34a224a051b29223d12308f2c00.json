She was then seen trying to smash windows with a hammer as police stood by.\n\nThe XR protest at the ministry comes less than 24 hours after police insisted they had banned demonstrators from London and cleared them from Trafalgar Square.\n\nThis morning despite police having banned XR from London the group's co-founder Gail Bradbrook was able to climb to the top of the Department for Tranport's glass revolving door this morning\n\nOnce there she hammered on the glass wall with a hammer and made a speech explaining she was making her protest for the sake of ancient woodland which might be felled for the creation of the HS2 high speed rail project\n\nThis morning after less than an hour, she was brought down by police in a cherry picker and was arrested.\n\nShe said she has protested at the Department of Transport to highlight her opposition against the planned HS2 rail link.\n\n'I did this for the beautiful pear tree at Cubbington Woods, 250 years old they have no rights. I do this in fierce love of the 108 ancient woodlands threatened by HS2, this climate crime of a project.\n\n'I do this in the spirit of what Emmeline Pankhurst called 'the noble art of window smashing\".'\n\nDr Bradbrook, 47, covered the building's entranceway with stickers and slogans saying 'HS2 is out climate emergency'\n\nA police officer tries to remove a woman after she attached herself with an adhesive to the building of Department of Transport, during an Extinction Rebellion protest in London\n\nAfter an hour police used a cherry picker to remove the protestor from the front of the government building\n\nGail Bradbrook was arrested today for climbing on top of the entrance of the Department of Transport and trying to smash glass panels with a hammer\n\nShe said Extinction Rebellion was calling for a plan for transitioning the UK to a zero carbon transport system, for a law of 'ecocide' to stop mass damage and destruction of nature and for nature to have rights.\n\nThis morning a police officer outside the Department for Transport confirmed that all protesters had been removed from the scene and claimed no-one had been glued to the building.\n\nPolice tape surrounds much of the main entrance to the department's offices, with Extinction Rebellion messages still stuck to it, although staff can now enter the building.\n\nA series of dents and a long crack can be seen on the window next to where Gail Bradbrook was standing before her arrest.\n\nThe protesters' latest actions came after the Metropolitan Police imposed conditions under Section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986, requiring any protest assembly in the capital to cease by 9pm on Monday.\n\nThe force said this was to 'prevent serious disruption to the life of the community'.\n\nIt announced\n\nOn Monday evening, activists were cleared from Trafalgar Square, where many had lawfully congregated for the past week.\n\nIn response to the police action, an Extinction Rebellion (XR) statement said its 'rebels' would take 'a moment to pause and remember why we are here'.\n\nIt added: 'Extinction Rebellion will let the Trafalgar Square site go tonight.

Police vans line the road behind him\n\nHoward Rees, an XR spokesman who was at the scene, told the Guardian that police started clearing Trafalgar Square before even issuing the revised order to protesters. 'They gave us the notification: 'We have started clearing the square',' Rees said.\n\n'It's all peaceful. People for the most part are being given the opportunity to move their possessions.'\n\nOn Twitter, the London branch of Extinction Rebellion labelled the clear out 'an emergency' and an 'outrage' before demanding police 'respect the law'.\n\n'Police are clearing peaceful protest in Trafalgar & Vauxhall. They are back-tracking on promises made &, MEPs say, in contravention of UK law, in the national square,' it added.\n\nThe protests were meant to continue on until Saturday, October 19, at 6pm but have now been cut five days short.\n\nAn Extinction Rebellion spokesman said: 'The Climate and Ecological Emergency isn't going away and we remain resolute in facing it.\n\n'We urge the Government and the authorities to join us in doing the same.

Extinction Rebellion will let the Trafalgar Square site go tonight. The International Rebellion continues.'\n\nThe first Rabbi to be arrested in the UK was apprehended by police in Bank yesterday while he prayed and sang for the first day of the festival Sukkot.\n\nHe said: 'It's impossible, at least for me, to read the Bible of Prophets without recognising how much we're rooted in the Earth, in social justice, in an awareness of the world around us, and, attempting to give all that we have on its behalf seems to me the highest calling towards God.\n\nAt 11pm Trafalgar Square was almost completely cleared - in stark contrast to just an hour before when tents were still raised and crowds of protesters stood wearing their raincoats in the autumnal drizzle\n\n'The highest principle is the saving of life, pikuach nefesh, there isn't anything more that we're doing here in Extinction Rebellion than being aware that millions, or hundreds of millions of people, already are at threat because of the changing climate, and if you add in future generations then \u2026 this is where we have to be. We have to work alongside those who are absolutely dedicated to trying to save life.'\n\nYesterday afternoon protesters planned to move along Fleet Street to the Royal Courts of Justice, to try and shut down the High Court and Court of Appeal.\n\nThe group had set up training camps over the weekend as they tried to bring in reinforcements following more than 1,300 arrests last week. Today, the total number of arrested topped 1,400.\n\nAmid heavy rain in London, the numbers of demonstrators seemed much depleted compared to last week.\n\nShower: Extinction Rebellion shut down roads around the Bank of England this morning as they attempt to push the chaos they are bringing to the capital\n\nAttention-seekers: Extinction Rebellion's so-called 'Red Brigade' were out in the square in front of the Bank of England\n\nSoggy: Numbers of demonstrators were down from last week as downpours turned cardboard signs to mush\n\nIn the way: A young demonstrator glued his hand inside the revolving door of Barclays Bank in Canary Wharf\n\nRemoval: Large teams of police officers resumed their daily struggle of trying to arrest as many uncompliant protestors as they can. The current number of arrests is more than 1,400\n\nWashout: Numbers of demonstrators was down from last week as rain swept into the capital yesterday morning\n\nThey borrowed the Bruce Lee phrase 'Be Water', which was used by the Hong Kong protesters, to describe constantly changing targets to out-fox police.\n\nThis morning, dozens of activists sat or stood in the road as City workers left Bank tube station.\n\nIn some surrounding streets traffic was brought to a standstill, with 20 double-decker buses queuing down Lombard Street and King William Street rendered stationary by the climate change protesters at Bank station.\n\nThe driver of the bus at the front of the queue said he had been there for two hours - since 7am - and protesters showed no signs of moving.\n\nProtesters, sheltering under umbrellas, were holding aloft flags bearing the Extinction Rebellion logo, while drummers played.\n\nActivists covered themselves in a large green tarpaulin to protect against the rain.\n\nMany were holding banners and placards bearing messages targeting financial institutions, such as 'divest from climate change' and 'invest in soil not oil'.\n\nDave Evans, 32, an IT consultant from London, said he had taken two weeks unpaid leave to join the Extinction Rebellion protests. He said the finance sector needed to 'stop funding the climate crisis'.\n\nDrain: Unhelpful protesters need up to eight officers each to arrest them, meaning forces in other parts of London struggle\n\nHands up: Police use a liquid to unstick protesters who have super-glued their hands together on the road\n\nWet: Some of the group crowded beneath a tarpaulin while others clutched umbrellas as they try to keep the movement going\n\nDead weight: A protester refuses to assist police, meaning it takes four officers to take him away to the police van\n\nPolice were warning protesters individually that they would be arrested under a Section 40 order for obstructing traffic if they do not leave the area.\n\nLeading activists, such as people carrying drums and a woman with a megaphone, were led away by officers as the crowd cheered them on.\n\nBut by around 3pm yesterday, police seemed to stop making arrests.\n\nAround 30 activists started a yoga session at the crossroads by Bank. Hundreds more sat on the floor or stood around them.\n\nMore than 1,400 people have already been arrested in the protests, part of an 'international rebellion' with action taking place in cities around the world.\n\nIn the UK, Extinction Rebellion is calling on the Government to declare a climate and ecological emergency, to act immediately to halt wildlife loss and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025.\n\nExtinction Rebellion said dozens of activists are expected to appear in court this week, including trials connected with previous action in April.\n\nFancy dress: A protester in a wig and decorated goggles is confronted by police near Mansion House this morning\n\nDetained: Police moved in and warned activists to return to their camp in Trafalgar Square. Those who stayed were arrested\n\nNew target: The demonstrators are changing their targets in a bid to wrong-foot stretched police resources\n\nStubborn: Many had to be carried away when they were arrested, maximising the number of police needed\n\nThe Met Police's Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said last week that the protests were stretching London's police resources and hitting victims of real crime elsewhere in the capital.\n\nHe said on Friday: 'Their behaviour still continues. They've deliberately set out to seek and cause chaos, they're performing activity that makes it dangerous and slow for us to clear them.\n\n'And whilst were not anti-protest, we are against them repeatedly breaking the law and causing this really significant disruption and as the Commissioner said this morning, this isn't a game for Londoners.\n\n'We have other things that we should be doing across London. We've had to take officers from those local communities and stop doing anything that's is not critical or urgent towards business and that's just not right.'\n\nIt comes as Scotland Yard's top officer warned that the Met had been 'stretched' by the Extinction Rebellion protests, impeding its ability to respond to other crimes.\n\nDame Cressida said she hoped the protesters would choose to either 'protest lawfully' at Trafalgar Square or 'go home'.\n\nAt around 4pm this afternoon, the roads around Bank and Monument stations were closed due to the protests\n\nExtinction Rebellion turn their attention to London's businesses after week targeting government and transport hubs\n\nActivists targeted BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, in London on Monday, demanding that the world's major financial institutions stop funding what they describe as a looming environmental catastrophe.\n\nExtinction Rebellion, which promotes revolt against established political, economic and social structures as a way to publicise its dramatic climate message, is in the middle of two weeks of civil disobedience in London.\n\nIts activists thronged the financial heart of London on Monday, blocking streets around locations such as the Bank of England and BlackRock.\n\nPolice attempt to remove a protester from a business headquarters this afternoon as Extinction Rebellion targeted BlackRock\n\nProtesters demonstrate outside the BlackRock headquarters in Throgmorton Avenue in London this afternoon\n\nActivists glued themselves to the doors of BlackRock while others staged a mock dinner party with rolled-up banknotes on their plates, a Reuters reporter said.\n\n'The City of London is a preeminent nexus of power in the global system that is killing our world,' said Carolina Rosa, spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from BlackRock.\n\nExtinction Rebellion wants non-violent civil disobedience to force governments to cut carbon emissions and avert a climate crisis it says will bring starvation and social collapse.\n\nCritics say the group is proposing what amounts to the overthrow of capitalism without any clear idea of what would replace it, and that the world's energy needs cannot be met without fossil fuels.", "description": "Extinction Rebellion founder Gail Bradbrook was arrested today for climbing on top of the entrance of the Department of Transport and trying to smash glass panels with a hammer.", "authors": ["Joel Adams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/09/19730956-0-image-a-51_1571129650031.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
