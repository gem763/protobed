His nomination to a beefed-up internal market portfolio prompted questions of conflicts of interest as he currently serves as CEO of technology company Atos, in which he owns shares worth about \u20ac34 million.\n\nThe spokesman said Breton \"has made far-reaching offers to avoid possible conflicts of interest.\"\n\nV\u00e1rhelyi is Hungary's current ambassador to the EU. Diplomats as well as current and former Hungarian officials described V\u00e1rhelyi, a career diplomat and former Commission official, as highly intelligent and extremely knowledgeable on EU issues. But multiple former Hungarian officials also describe an abrasive leadership style that has included screaming, yelling and swearing at staffers. V\u00e1rhelyi has declined to comment on those allegations.\n\nV\u00e1rhelyi is expected to be earmarked to take responsibility for EU enlargement and relations with the bloc's neighbors.\n\nRomania has yet to nominate a commissioner acceptable to von der Leyen after the European Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee rejected Rovana Plumb, an ex-minister, over conflict of interest concerns. Plumb had been slated to take on the transport portfolio.\n\nRomania's social democrat government led by Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103 re-proposed MEP Dan Nica for the job, after first putting his name forward together with Plumb's. However, von der Leyen did not nominate him.\n\nD\u0103ncil\u0103's government lost a confidence vote earlier this month but remains in office in caretaker capacity. Parliament will vote on a new opposition-led government on November 4.\n\nVon der Leyen and her team are urging all the key political players in Romania to put forward a new candidate swiftly.\n\nThe \"Romanian government was asked again (with the Romanian President in copy) to nominate a candidate as soon as possible,\" the transition team spokesperson said.\n\nThe spokesperson specified the nominee should not be someone from \"an earlier selection process nor rejected by the Parliament.\"", "description": "President-elect\u2019s team also ups pressure on Romania to present new candidate.", "authors": ["Anca Gurzu", "Rym Momtaz", "Laura Kayali", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "John Rega", "Carmen Paun"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1134804106-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
