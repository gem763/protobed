The Vietnam Ho Chi Minh index has risen 9.1% year-to-date, versus the S&P 500 index\u2019s SPX, -0.01% 15.1% rise.\n\nThat said, a firm need not be directly related to manufacturing to benefit from an influx of activity from China to Vietnam. For instance, his fund has invested in a Vietnamese bank and a shopping mall operator, on the belief that greater manufacturing activity will lead to greater retail sales.\n\nRead: Here\u2019s how to play the trade war with ETFs\n\n\u201cThere will be a wave of investment to boost capacity, and that\u2019s good for the currency and consumer spending,\u201d Saltiel said. \u201cYou have to be selective, but the big picture story for Vietnam is a good one.\u201d\n\nSteven Holden, chief executive of Copley Fund Research, said in an interview that a trend of emerging-market portfolio managers investing in Vietnamese companies has accelerated. In a survey of 193 fund managers, Holden found that nearly a fifth now have exposure to Vietnamese stocks, even as the country isn\u2019t represented in the benchmark MSCI Emerging Markets Index 891800, +0.26%.\n\nCopley Fund Research\n\nThe emerging-market investment funds with the largest allocations to Vietnamese stocks include Alliance Bernstein\u2019s Emerging Markets Growth portfolio, Odin Emerging Markets fund and Polar Capital Emerging Market Stars funds, according to Copely Data.\n\n\u201cAlthough Vietnam remains in the MSCI Frontier Markets Index, there is the possibility it will be added to the MSCI Watchlist for an upgrade to emerging markets status at some point,\u201d Holden said. \u201cExpect allocations to rise still further should this happen.\u201d\n\nThe rising popularity of Vietnamese stocks comes at the same time that global fund managers have reduced their holdings of US stocks relative to their weights in benchmark indexes, Holden said.\n\nAs of Aug. 31, global managers reduced their holdings of US stocks to 6.83% below their weighting in the MSCI All Country World Index 892400, +0.01%, the lowest relative position since Copley began collating the data in 2011, indicating nervousness among global investors as to the impact of the trade conflict on U.S. tech companies, Holden said.", "description": "Emerging market investors are buying up Vietnamese shares as the economy benefits from a reorganization of global supply chains", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ954_vietna_ZG_20190909140339.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
