Kovalev is a dangerous puncher, and he\u2019s naturally the bigger man, but that\u2019s the kind of challenges and risks that I like to face.\u201d\n\nCanelo Alvarez (@Canelo) #CaneloKovalev Es oficial. Estoy feliz de anunciar que subir\u00e9 2 categor\u00edas para enfrentar a uno de los rivales m\u00e1s poderosos de esta divisi\u00f3n . Este 02 de Noviembre ser\u00e1 uno de los mayores retos de mi carrera. Vamos a hacer historia juntos. Vamos por 4x World Champion @DAZN_USA pic.twitter.com/0dAaG4Y3Yt\n\nKovalev (34-3-1, 29 KOs), a three-time champion at 175lbs, is fresh off an 11th-round knockout of Britain\u2019s Anthony Yarde to retain the WBO title in Russia last month. It will mark the 17th consecutive world title bout for the 36-year-old knockout artist.\n\n\u201cIn order to be the best you have to beat the best,\u201d Kovalev said. \u201cI have always tried to fight the toughest opponents in my division, but many have ducked me throughout my career. Canelo wanted to fight me; to step up to higher weight and challenge for my belt. I will be ready.\u201d\n\n\u00c1lvarez, who has never fought above super middleweight, can become only the fourth fighter in boxing history to win titles at 154lbs and 175lbs, joining Sugar Ray Leonard, Thomas Hearns and Mike McCallum.", "description": "The Mexican star will move up two weight classes to challenge Sergey Kovalev for the WBO light heavyweight championship on 2 November", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c8a0021cd9f3a44cb55ab260b13e5d415c73487/0_74_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=20ca69affb9834e1d21b7634edbdb816", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
