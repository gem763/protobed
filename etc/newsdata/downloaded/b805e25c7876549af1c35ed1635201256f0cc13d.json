The golfer brought his two children and girlfriend Erica Herman to the match against Marin Cilic and he matched the Spaniard nearly fist pump-for-fist pump during his 6-3, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory. Afterward, the two put on an impromptu show for ESPN, with Tiger gazing fondly from the stands as Nadal did his post-match interview on the court.\n\n\u201cFor me it was a great honor playing in front of all of you [fans], of course,\u201d Nadal told Tom Rinaldi. \u201cPlaying in front of Tiger is for me a very special thing. I always say I never had big idols, but I have to say one idol is him.\u201d\n\nWoods is recovering from an arthroscopic procedure to repair minor cartilage damage in his left knee after a season in which he won the Masters for the fifth time.\n\n\u201cI always try to follow him, every single shot that he hit the whole year,\u201d Nadal said, bringing a smile to Woods\u2019s face. \u201cFor me, it is a big pleasure having him here supporting [me]. It means a lot. He\u2019s a big legend of the sport, one of the greatest sportsmen of all time. I just want to congratulate him for one of the more amazing comebacks ever in sports, winning the Masters this year.\u201d\n\nThe admiration was mutual, with Woods, who wore an Oakland Raiders cap to the match, tweeting, \u201cWhat a great night watching @RafaelNadal. Just an incredible performance and awesome way to close out the match.\u201d\n\nRafael Nadal advances to the quarterfinals at the #USOpen \ud83d\udcaa pic.twitter.com/OlzV85aNZ6 \u2014 ESPN (@espn) September 3, 2019\n\nGame recognizes game and heaven knows both have it. Nadal is seeking his 19th Grand Slam title at the Open, trailing only Roger Federer\u2019s 20. The future sets up more favorably for Nadal, 33, than Woods, who will turn 44 at the end of the year. With No. 1 Novak Djokovic out of the Open with a shoulder injury, second-ranked Nadal will play Diego Schwartzman, a 20th-ranked Argentine player, in a quarterfinal Wednesday night. For Woods, a history-making run seems more remote, as he trails Jack Nicklaus in majors won by three titles.\n\nTheir paths have crossed before with Nadal attending Woods\u2019s Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas two years ago. Golf, Nadal stressed, is a hobby and he joked when asked if he\u2019d played a round with Woods.\n\n\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s much better if Tiger doesn\u2019t see my swing,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe he can lose a little bit of rhythm after that.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAs Serena Williams eyes history at the U.S. Open, a topsy-turvy field just tries to keep up\n\nDefending champion Naomi Osaka loses at U.S. Open to Belinda Bencic\n\nNo. 1 seed Novak Djokovic exits in fourth round, retiring with an injury in match against Stan Wawrinka\n\nIn the U.S. Open men\u2019s draw, there\u2019s the big three \u2014 and a handful of others", "description": "There were fist-pumps aplenty as Woods and his family took in a little tennis.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories", "September At Am", "Cindy Boren Arrived At The Post In As An Assignment Editor In Charge Of Baseball", "Nfl Redskins Coverage.
