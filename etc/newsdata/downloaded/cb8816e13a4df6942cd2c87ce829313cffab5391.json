(Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump has had trouble with a number of the Ten Commandments.\n\nThere\u2019s the adultery. There\u2019s the prohibition against giving false witness, for a man who has made more than 12,000 false or misleading claims during his presidency.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this commandment: Thou shalt not take the Lord\u2019s name in vain.\n\nThat\u2019s the one the president violated again on Thursday night, when he joked about \u201cgoddamn windmills\u201d while talking with House Republicans in Baltimore about energy policy.\n\nFor some of the president\u2019s evangelical supporters, Trump\u2019s occasional use of the word \u201cgoddamn\u201d is a bridge too far, even for a president whose behavior they\u2019ve grown accustomed to excusing as they fervently support his policies.\n\n\u201cI certainly do not condone taking the Lord\u2019s name in vain. There is a whole commandment dedicated to prohibiting that,\u201d said the Rev. Robert Jeffress, a Texas megachurch leader who is one of Trump\u2019s most outspoken evangelical advisers and supporters. \u201cI think it\u2019s very offensive to use the Lord\u2019s name in vain. I can take just about everything else, except that,\u201d when it comes to off-color language.\n\n[Why evangelicals will stand by Trump in 2020]\n\nTrump has been urged in the past to cease using this particular word. A state senator from West Virginia, Paul Hardesty, told Politico in August that he got calls from three constituents after one Trump rally alone. He wrote a letter to the White House: \u201cNever utter those words again.\u201d\n\nAt that rally, the president had told a North Carolina crowd about the Islamic State, \u201cThey\u2019ll be hit so goddamn hard,\u201d and had recalled warning a businessman, \u201cIf you don\u2019t support me, you\u2019re going to be so goddamn poor.\u201d\n\nThis was the same Greenville rally at which Trump\u2019s supporters chanted \u201csend her back\u201d about Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), a chant Democrats decried as racist. But it was the blasphemy that spurred some West Virginians to call their Trump-supporting state senator to ask him to do something about the president\u2019s language.\n\nThat\u2019s not surprising to Timothy Jay, a retired psychology professor who made it his business for 40 years to be the world\u2019s leading expert on swear words.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done surveys where I ask people: What\u2019s the most offensive word?\u201d Jay said. \u201cSome [religious] women would say the word \u2018f---,\u2019 but they wouldn\u2019t say \u2018Jesus Christ.\u2019 Some of my interviewees have said, \u2018We could say \u2018f---\u2019 and \u2018s---\u2019 at home, but we weren\u2019t allowed to use profane language.\u201d\n\nProfanity, Jay notes, is not the same as obscenity. An obscenity is a crude term for a bodily function. Profanity demeans something from the sacred realm \u2014 for example, misusing the words \u2018hell\u2019 or \u2018damn,\u2019 which in some Christian interpretations ought to be reserved for talking only about God\u2019s role in judging the dead.\n\nBlasphemy is a specific type of profanity \u2014 an insult to God.\n\n[Donald Trump uses the rhetorical strategies of Cicero, the greatest orator in history]\n\nAmerican culture tends to consider obscenities to be more taboo. An f-bomb sounds much more crude to most listeners than \u201chell\u201d or \u201cgoddamn\u201d or an exclamation of \u201cJesus Christ.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheologically, that\u2019s backwards,\u201d said Karen Swallow Prior, an English professor at Liberty University, the conservative evangelical school in Virginia. \u201cYou can look at any culture and see what it values by its swear words. Whatever it is that it values most, those are the things that will have words related to them that are verboten.\u201d\n\nIn other words, she said, Christians ought to hold the sacred in much higher esteem than the body or sex acts \u2014 and thus to care much more about words that demean the sacred. When she teaches her students at Liberty about the plays \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u201d and \u201cDeath of a Salesman,\u201d shows replete with sexual expressions and coarse arguments, she lectures: \u201cAs Christians, the most offensive thing probably should be Willy Loman\u2019s taking of the Lord\u2019s name in vain throughout the play.\u201d\n\nShe noted that Christian squeamishness about vulgar bodily terms arises out of the Victorian era, not the early church, and can change with the times. \u201cMartin Luther had quite a mouth,\u201d she said.\n\nJeffress agreed that profanity is more problematic than other crass language. Asked to compare Trump\u2019s use of \u201cgoddamn\u201d to his infamous reference to certain nations as \u201cshithole countries\u201d \u2014 a statement which several evangelical pastors did condemn \u2014 Jeffress said the worse offense was the profanity.\n\n\u201cI would never condone taking the Lord\u2019s name in vain,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to other types of foul language, that\u2019s a concern, but it\u2019s certainly not the major concern when we\u2019re in a virtual battle for the soul of the nation.\u201d\n\nLanguage aside, Trump remains highly popular among evangelical voters. Almost 70 percent of white evangelicals told Pew Research Center this year that they approve of his performance in office. Most evangelicals support him for appointing conservative Supreme Court justices, restricting abortion access and LGBT rights, favoring Israel and other policy priorities.\n\n[\u2018He gets it\u2019: Evangelicals are thrilled by Trump\u2019s first term]\n\nJeffress said he hears from pastors and congregants in conservative parts of the country who are concerned about Trump\u2019s language, including the insults he uses on Twitter. But the president is not losing their votes, the evangelical leader said.\n\n\u201cHe enjoys a tremendous amount of support from people of faith not because of his language, but in spite of his language,\u201d Jeffress said. \u201cMost Americans did not oppose the salty language of General Patton. All they cared about was that he led us to victory. Many Christians believe we are in a war \u2026 for the culture, a war for the soul of America.\u201d\n\nIn his speech in Baltimore on Thursday, Trump came out swinging against many of his favorite targets, including his 2016 rival Hillary Clinton and several of his prospective 2020 rivals, for whom he engaged in another of his favorite rhetorical moves: name-calling. He referred to \u201cSleepy Joe,\u201d \u201cCrazy Bernie\u201d and \u201cPocahontas.\u201d\n\nHe arrived at the profanity when he turned to criticizing wind power, with an incorrect description of the technology.\n\n\u201cThe energy is intermittent. If you happen to be watching the Democrat debate and the wind isn\u2019t blowing, you\u2019re not going to see the debate. \u2018Charlie, what the hell happened to this debate?\u2019 He says, \u2018Darling, the wind isn\u2019t blowing. The goddamn windmill stopped,\u2019\u201d Trump said to the Republican congressmen, who laughed.\n\nWind power does not stop powering appliances when the wind stops blowing.\n\nTrump is not alone in the 2020 field in employing strong language once considered unfit for polite discussion. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) have all said \u201cdamn\u201d in Democratic debates. Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), Andrew Yang and Juli\u00e1n Castro have all used obscenities in debates, interviews or tweets.\n\nFormer congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke has become so well-known for cursing on the campaign trail that his campaign sells official $30 T-shirts that use the words \u201chell\u201d and \u201cf*cked up.\u201d\n\nBut Jay, the expert who has published decades of research studies on swearing, says that Democrats remain deeply cautious about one taboo when it comes to language: terms that are offensive on the basis of gender or race.\n\nThat\u2019s another taboo that Trump has long ago crossed.", "description": "Many evangelicals are deeply offended by Trump\u2019s continued use of a certain word, but they back him on judges, abortion and a host of other issues.", "authors": ["Julie Zauzmer", "Reporter Covering Religion", "Faith", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EddyiI8nPz6mADzWn0KKNV57VOE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A52PSCGWQQI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
