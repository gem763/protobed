Right-sided Hoever played to a high standard throughout. Smooth on the ball, he always made time for himself in possession.\n\nWhen he moved forward with the ball, he reminded me of Mark Lawrenson. He had the pace to recover and make a last-ditch tackle after the centre forward had escaped his centre back partner.\n\nThe Dutch youngster must improve his physicality if he is to flourish in English football though\n\nWHAT DOES HE NEED?\n\nHe has time to fill out physically. He is willowy but tackles firmly and stays on his feet. As he breezed through the first half, I detected only one downside. In two attempts to win the ball in the air against a more muscular opponent, he jumped too early and mistimed it completely, giving the opposition a free-kick.\n\nHe must not get too confident as he tries to win the ball early.\n\nBack on the deck, twice he anticipated superbly and stepped in front of his opponent to nick the ball and move forward in possession.\n\nHis confidence grew as the game progressed: a talented teenager in an Under 23 game. I feel he needs to be tested quickly in first-team football where it is tougher and more frenetic. It would help fast-track his career. I will be surprised if he is not challenging very soon.", "description": "Our scout is a top football expert who attends matches each week searching for the next star.
