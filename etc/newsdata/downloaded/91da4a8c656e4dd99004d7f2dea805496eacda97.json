How to thrive in an empty nest", "language": "en", "text": "So the children have all grown up and moved out \u2026 what now? We talked to empty-nesters making the most of their newfound freedom\n\nOf all a child\u2019s rites of passage, by far the most uncomfortable for parents is the day they leave home. It is an inevitability, of course, yet somehow, even after nearly two decades of school runs, homework and the general drudgery of parenting, it can come as a nasty shock. \u201cYou suddenly feel desperate to hang on to them; to feel you have a purpose,\u201d says Ros Carman, a psychotherapist based in south-west London.\n\nYet life moves on. Rather than getting caught up in the gloom of empty nest syndrome once your children have started university, it\u2019s far better to have a plan, says Harry Benson, founder of Marriage Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s a time of great opportunity \u2013 see yourself as a free bird,\u201d he says. With the youngest of his seven children now 15, his wife, Kate, is reinventing herself as a potter. \u201cWe realised that we needed to think further ahead, so she did a foundation course,\u201d he says. \u201cShe may go on and do a degree and \u00adafterwards she\u2019ll have a new role.\u201d\n\nWhat if you don\u2019t have any pent-up skills or passions to exploit? Learn something new, insists Carman, who was a housewife for many years before retraining as a psychotherapist when her daughter was in her teens. Studying, in her experience, can open up a whole new outlook. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do secretarial work down the road,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s your time \u2013 get the most out of your life.\u201d", "description": "So the children have all grown up and moved out \u2026 what now?", "authors": ["Anna Tyzack", "Bryony Gordon", "Judith Woods", "Dame Moya Greene Dbe", "Stephanie Baxter", "Rosa Silverman", "Allison Pearson", "Celia Walden"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/women/2018/09/21/Telegraph-Sunday-cover2x-100-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqfBeepJu3h1MCX-iDnWlhGKOat8yCmTOOQvmezBx4bPU.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2018-09-21"}
