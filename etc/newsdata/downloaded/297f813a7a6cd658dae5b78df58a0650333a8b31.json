REUTERS/Mark Blinch/File Photo\n\nAnalysts in a Reuters poll had predicted an increase of 0.1% in July following a 0.2% increase in June. Overall, 12 of the 20 industrial sectors monitored expanded on the month, while eight declined, the national statistics agency said.\n\nThe Canadian dollar weakened to C$1.3290 or 75.24 cents U.S. after the July GDP miss.\n\nCanada is in the midst of a national election set for Oct. 21 where economic issues, like the cost-of-living, have played a central role on the campaign trail. Meanwhile, the Bank of Canada has held interest rates steady since last October as it monitors Canadian economic data.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s data are consistent with the [Bank of Canada\u2019s] view that growth over the second half of the year is likely to be slightly slower than the first half,\u201d said Josh Nye, a senior economist with RBC Economics, adding there were \u201cfew signs of a broader slowdown.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat gives the central bank time to be patient in assessing whether a bit more accommodation is needed to offset external headwinds,\u201d Nye said in a note.\n\nStatscan said goods-producing industries were down 0.7% in July as outputs from all sectors - excepting utilities - declined. Services-producing industries were up for the fifth consecutive month, rising 0.3% as the majority of its subsectors grew.\n\nCanada\u2019s mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction sector dropped by 3.5% in July, the largest decrease since May 2016, Statistics Canada said. Support activities for those same industries slumped by 11.5%, the largest decline since December 2018, following three consecutive months of growth, as drilling and lower rigging services contracted.\n\nOil and gas extraction (except oil sands) fell 4.7%, the biggest monthly decline seen in a decade, the agency said - thanks, in large part, to a shutdown of some offshore production facilities in Newfoundland and Labrador because of maintenance issues.\n\nDeclines were also reported in the construction sector, which dropped by 0.7%. Manufacturing fell for the second straight month, falling 0.1%, while the transportation and warehouse sector contracted by 0.5% on slower rail transportation.\n\nReal estate and related industries increased 4.2%, while utilities rose by 1.5%. Wholesale trade jumped 1.1%, the sixth increase in seven months, Statscan said.\n\n(Graphic - Canada economic snapshot: tmsnrt.rs/2e8hNWV)", "description": "Canada's economy was unexpectedly unchanged in July, following four months of growth, as the country's mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction sectors contracted, Statistics Canada data showed on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Kelsey Johnson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435891348&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902U7-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
