A redacted version of the initial whistleblower\u2019s complaint was released Thursday morning by the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nThe document, which includes the accounts of a handful of U.S. officials, alleged the president was \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d It further alleged that members of the administration had attempted to \u201clock down\u201d records relating to Trump\u2019s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, \u201cespecially the word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced.\u201d\n\nBut until more definitive details emerge on how the new information guides next steps in impeachment proceedings, trade, economic data releases and corporate earnings results remain the driving forces of the markets.\n\nA spate of new economic data Thursday was broadly positive on the domestic economy. The Department of Labor\u2019s weekly jobless claims rose slightly more-than-than expected last week, but continuing unemployment claims unexpectedly declined for the week prior.\n\nMeanwhile, second-quarter GDP rose an expected 2.0%, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis\u2019s third print on domestic output. Personal consumption, however, was downwardly revised by a hair to see an annualized gain 4.6%, from the 4.7% reported previously. And pending home sales rebounded in August, rising a better-than-expected 1.6% after a decline of 2.5% in July, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday.\n\nOn the trade front, the World Trade Organization (WTO) is said to be ready to authorize tariffs on nearly $8 billion of European goods over what the U.S. has called illegal state aid for EU-based Airbus SE (AIR.PA), Bloomberg reported. The authorization, which will reportedly be made public by the end of September, will codify penalties in a long-standing dispute between the U.S. and EU over subsidies for the aircraft-maker, and will likely spark retaliatory tariffs from the EU on U.S. goods.\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 18, 2019.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a statement called this \u201cone of the largest sanctions actions the United States has taken against entities and individuals identified as transporting Iranian oil since our sanctions were re-imposed in November 2018.\u201d\n\nWith China as the world\u2019s largest crude oil purchaser, the sanctions could add another hurdle to U.S.-China trade talks, with high-level negotiations set to pick back up again in October. This also comes after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said during the United Nations General Assembly in New York that he would not come to the negotiating table with Trump as long as U.S. sanctions on Iran are in place.\n\nSTOCKS: Peloton shares set to start trading\n\nPeloton\u2019s stock is set to begin trading publicly on the Nasdaq under the ticker \u201cPTON\u201d during market hours Thursday.\n\nLate Wednesday, the indoor exercise equipment company priced its initial public offering (IPO) at $29 per share, at the high end of its previously targeted $26-29 per share range. The company sold 40 million class A shares, raising $1.16 billion and giving it a valuation of more than $8 billion.\n\nStory continues", "description": "U.S. stocks slipped Thursday as investors continued to weigh trade optimism against uncertainty around an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cCmygvX5rFmfkFKumfUwmQ--~B/aD00MjczO3c9NjQwOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/37e8fa70-e058-11e9-bfbe-2c28eada75b8", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
