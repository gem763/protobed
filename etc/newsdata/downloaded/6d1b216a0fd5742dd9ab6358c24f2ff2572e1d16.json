Everyone will fail, everyone,\" Espert said at Reuters' office in Buenos Aires.\n\nArgentina, in and out of recession for decades, is battling an economic crisis amid steep inflation, a volatile currency and mountainous debts that threaten to tip the country into default. Poverty levels, meanwhile, stand at above 35%.\n\nAs elections near, Peronist center-left candidate Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez is the distant front-runner ahead of conservative incumbent Mauricio Macri, whose administration has been hit by the economic woes as voters face rising hardship.\n\nEspert believes that both Fern\u00e1ndez and Macri represent parties that have not implemented sufficient structural reforms that the economy needs to get out of its slump.\n\nHis Awakening Front party has 13 proposals to drive \"real change\", including total free trade, a much reduced state spending to help cut the fiscal deficit, an education overhaul and labor reforms taking power away from powerful unions.\n\nEspert said that even though he's likely to make little impact on the final vote this year, it has helped put him on the map and he will run again for a Congressional role in 2021 and in the next presidential election in 2023.\n\nHis prediction for the vote this month? A clear Fernandez win, with no need for a second round. \"The most likely scenario is that we have a new president on Oct. 27 and that it will be Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez,\" he said. \"But let's see.\" (Reporting by Nicolas Misculin and Walter Bianchi; Editing by Adam Jourdan and Grant McCool)", "description": "Argentina needs to make radical changes including trimming back big government and freeing international trade to avoid slipping into disaster, presidential candidate and libertarian economist Jos\u00e9 Luis Espert told Reuters.
