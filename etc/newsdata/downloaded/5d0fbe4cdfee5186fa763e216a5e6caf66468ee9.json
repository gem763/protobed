But U.S. District Judge Madeline Cox Arleo noted the 61-year-old\u2019s lack of a prior criminal record and her belief that the $80,000 contribution wasn\u2019t meant to influence the U.S. election.\n\nU.S. law prohibits foreign nationals from making contributions to federal candidates. Attorney John Azzarello, representing Argeros, said his client was acting on behalf of a candidate for prime minister of Albania who wanted a photo taken with Obama.\n\nThe candidate was Edi Rama, Azzarello said, who was elected and currently is Albania\u2019s prime minister. When the charges became public in 2016, Rama\u2019s office denied being the source of the contribution.\n\nThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office contended Argeros arranged that the contribution was made through a New Jersey resident, Bilal Shehu. Shehu was sentenced to probation in 2017.\n\nCox Arleo said she gave Argeros a stricter sentence because he acknowledged lying to a grand jury.\n\nArgeros had been living in Tampa, Florida, at the time the charges were brought. He also spent many years in the Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, area where his work included serving on a prison advisory board and helping prisoners re-enter society, Azzarello said Monday. Some of his former colleagues wrote letters to Cox Arleo supporting him.\n\nA tearful Argeros told the judge, \u201cI\u2019m ashamed and I take full responsibility for what I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nCox Arleo also sentenced Argeros to four months\u2019 home confinement and community service.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "William Argeros pleaded guilty to making foreign contributions and lying to a grand jury.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/02/17/AP_18307055753158_c0-572-1656-1537_s1770x1032.jpg?f0ac64ccaad61cf55d76a5643a8028647397a932", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
