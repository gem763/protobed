REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado\n\nInformation Minister Jorge Rodriguez also said the government would reform the national electoral commission, which the opposition and Western observers have denounced as biased after the 2018 election, won by Maduro, which they claim was rigged. Rodriguez gave no details about these possible changes.\n\nThe agreement was made with a different sector of the opposition than that led by U.S.-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido, the head of the National Assembly congress who invoked the constitution to assume a rival presidency in January.\n\nThe announcement comes after Guaido on Sunday said negotiations in Barbados between the opposition and government mediated by Norway \u201chad been exhausted\u201d after the Maduro administration withdrew delegates in August following a tightening of U.S. sanctions.\n\n\u201cWe have not closed any door to any initiative to resolve among Venezuelans the issues that concern us,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cWe have reached agreement on some issues and have a working agenda on others.\u201d\n\nAs part of the agreement, the government said lawmakers would return to the National Assembly for the first time since 2017, when Maduro declared the body illegitimate and created a parallel legislature called the National Constituent Assembly to override opposition delegates\u2019 decisions.\n\nMaduro\u2019s Socialist Party of Venezuela holds 54 of the National Assembly\u2019s 167 seats.\n\nHowever, the document did not propose eliminating the Constituent Assembly, but rather a \u201cbalance of both powers.\u201d\n\nOpposition negotiator Stalin Gonzalez said the Maduro government is feeling pressure within its ranks to reopen negotiations. Presidential elections were on the table when Maduro\u2019s government pulled its officials from the talks, he said.\n\n\u201cWithin the regime there is a lot of pressure on the leadership ... The regime knows that there are many people who are willing to agree to them,\u201d Gonzalez, the National Assembly\u2019s vice president, told Reuters.\n\nOn Monday Guaido said the proposal negotiators had laid out in Barbados included a transition government, to include lawmakers from all parties, and new elections.\n\nGonzalez dismissed the government\u2019s agreement with the smaller opposition faction, saying it was unlikely to end the political crisis. The document did not mention a transitional government or presidential elections.\n\nMaduro, who retains control of the state and military, derides Guaido as a U.S.-controlled puppet who is seeking to foment a coup. Most Western nations recognise Guaido as Venezuela\u2019s rightful head of state.", "description": "Venezuela's government said on Monday it was evaluating sending some of its lawmakers back to the opposition-controlled National Assembly, which President Nicolas Maduro has called an illegal institution, as part of new talks with one opposition faction.", "authors": ["Corina Pons", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430566074&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1HV", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
