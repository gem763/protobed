He refused to give any further details, saying they were for Britain and the EU to negotiate.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really positive about is that both governments (Ireland and Britain) seem to be on track to coming towards an accommodation. ... The Prime Minister has always been committed to a deal and what we saw today of both sides was taking the time to ensure that a deal is now a distinct possibility.\u201d", "description": "No single party in Northern Ireland will be given a veto in any Brexit deal that is now \"a distinct possibility\" following a positive meeting between the Irish and British leaders on Thursday, Britain's Northern Ireland minister said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439448473&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF992D8", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
