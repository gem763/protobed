Diplomats had been pessimistic about significant progress by the end of this week, seen as a necessary precursor to a deal at the European Council summit on Thursday next week.\n\nAfter a fractious start to the week, the Brexit mood music became more positive following a meeting between Boris Johnson and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar on Thursday. After that meeting Varadkar said he could see a \"pathway to a deal,\" language echoed in a statement issued by Downing Street.\n\nHowever, skepticism remains among the EU27 that a deal can be done in time to agree it at next week's leader's summit.\n\nFollowing Friday's stock take, both a U.K. government spokesperson and Barnier told journalists after the meeting that it had been \"constructive.\" However, Barnier sounded a note of caution as he left: \u201cI\u2019ve already said that Brexit is like climbing a mounting: we need vigilance, determination and patience.\u201d\n\nLater in the afternoon, Johnson ducked questions about customs arrangements in Northern Ireland after Brexit, one of two main obstacles to a deal between the U.K. and the EU.\n\nSpeaking during a visit to a school, Johnson said: \u201cWell, I can certainly tell you that under no circumstances will we see anything that damages the ability of the whole of the United Kingdom to take full advantage of Brexit.\n\nHowever, Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party issued a statement to reiterate that they would not support deal that effectively puts a border down the Irish see, cutting Northern Ireland off from the rest of the U.K.\n\n\u201cWe have been consistent in our opposition to the backstop, whether U.K. or NI only, and anything that traps Northern Ireland in the European Union, whether single market or customs union, as the rest of the United Kingdom leaves will not have our support. The prime minister is very mindful of that,\u201d the DUP\u2019s leader Arlene Foster said in a statement.\n\nShe restated that the U.K. \u201cmust leave the EU as one nation\u201d and that \u201cdemocratic consent was required in circumstances where Northern Ireland would align alongside specific sectors of the EU single market.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, Tusk told reporters that the U.K. \u201cstill not come forward with a workable, realistic proposal\u201d and that \u201cthere\u2019s no guarantee of success and the time is practically up\u201d but added: \u201cEven the slightest chance must be used.\u201d\n\nThree diplomats present at the Barnier briefing for EU27 ambassadors said he had recommended stepping up the talks. One characterized the change as moving from a phase of questioning the U.K. negotiating team about aspects of London's offer to a true negotiation dialogue. But a second diplomat said this did not mean the talks were heading into a so-called tunnel where the two sides enter into intensive talks with little outside communication.\n\n\"It is not really a tunnel. We will go deeper into negotiations,\" the diplomat said, adding, \"we don't want to raise expectations.\"\n\nA third diplomat said: \u201cintensive discussions are planned throughout the next days.\u201d\n\nEleni Courea and Cristina Gallardo contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
