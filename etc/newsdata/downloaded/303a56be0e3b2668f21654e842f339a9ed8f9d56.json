Police have used the blue dye to identify protesters.\n\nIt was the heaviest use of water canons by police and many people hit with the water developed coughs, suggesting an irritant may be mixed with the water.\n\nAs riot police advanced protesters fell back to their next barricade, unlike past rallies when they stood and clashed with police, throwing petrol bombs and bricks.\n\nAlong the march route, protesters trashed metro stations and hundreds of shops, throwing goods onto the streets. Several Chinese banks were targeted.\n\nProtesters have in the past targeted Chinese banks and shops with links to mainland China, leaving mainland Chinese living in Hong Kong worried about their safety.\n\nOne trashed shop on Sunday had notices left on its shutters saying it was attacked because it was owned by mainland Chinese mobs who had attacked innocent people. \"We never rob. We don't forgive. We don't forget\", said the notice.\n\nBy nightfall only small groups of protesters remained, with one group throwing petrol bombs down a street towards police who responded with tear gas. Large numbers of riot police guarded several intersections.\n\nPolice said they had seized more than 40 petrol bombs that they believe may have been en route to the protest.\n\nThey said protesters had set fire to numerous road barriers and trashed shops in several Kowloon districts. Police detonated what they said was an explosive device surrounded by broken bricks and left in the middle of a street.\n\nThe unrest was sparked four months ago by a bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts. It has since widened into a pro-democracy movement.\n\nThe protests in the city pose the biggest popular challenge to China's President Xi Jinping since he took power. Beijing has denied eroding Hong Kong's freedoms and Xi has vowed to crush any attempt to split China.\n\n\n\n\n\n'HONGKONGERS RESIST'\n\nPolice had declared Sunday's march illegal due to concerns over public safety. Protesters, ranging from young students to the elderly, many carrying umbrellas to shield their faces from street surveillance cameras, face arrest.\n\nFor the first few hours, the march was peaceful.\n\nAt the start of the march banners reading \"Free Hong Kong\" stretched across the ground. Other posters read \"HongKongers Resist\", while graffiti on one wall said \"Better Dead than Red\".\n\nHardcore protesters set up road blocks and sprayed graffiti saying: \"We chose to die on our feet rather than live on our knees!\" Some tore up pavement bricks for clashes with police.\n\nProtesters believe the police's refusal to issue a permit for Sunday's march was an attempt to limit their numbers, as some would fear being arrested.", "description": "Hong Kong police and protesters exchanged tear gas and petrol bombs as an illegal anti-government march that attracted tens of thousands descended into chaos, with hundreds of shops trashed and Chinese banks and metro stations targeted.
