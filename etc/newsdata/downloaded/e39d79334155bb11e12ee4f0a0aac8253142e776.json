We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nAs for the plot of the show, she said, \u201cWe\u2019re our age, I\u2019m almost 60 and she\u2019s 65, and we\u2019re looking for our next act, without ever having had husbands [or] children. And there will be two other people who haven\u2019t been cast yet. But it\u2019s kind of a \u2018Golden Girls\u2019 for today.\u201d\n\nIn a July Facebook post, writer and comedian Carol Leifer appeared to confirm her involvement in the project.\n\n\u201cA writer\u2019s dream to work with these two legends,\u201d wrote Leifer, whose Hollywood r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see where we land\u2026\u201d\n\nA prospective premiere date for the series has not yet been announced.\n\nOther female-centric shows like HBO\u2019s \u201cSex and the City\u201d and Netflix\u2019s \u201cGrace and Frankie\u201d have been compared to \u201cThe Golden Girls,\u201d which ran from 1985 to 1992.\n\nStill, Lynch\u2019s words could prove to be a tall order, given that \u201cThe Golden Girls\u201d remains enduringly popular in syndication. Over the years, the show\u2019s legions of devoted fans have created a wild assortment of tributes to the series, too, including a breakfast cereal, a touring puppet show and a New York restaurant.\n\nWe\u2019ve already got our fingers crossed for a Betty White cameo, though!", "description": "The Grammy-winning pop icon is said to be teaming up with the \"Glee\" star on a new series for Netflix.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7ff1443b0000039fd4b4df.jpeg?cache=ihqz5wwmzv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
