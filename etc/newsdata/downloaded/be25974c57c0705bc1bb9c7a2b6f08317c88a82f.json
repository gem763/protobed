Neither blunt nor blaring, this remarkable drug somehow renders things sharper and calmer simultaneously. No wonder the Europeans got hooked. But nicotine demands a deadly loyalty. Within a generation of Columbus, the progressive priest Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas was fretting over the phenomenon we now call addiction.\n\nIn other words, all the elements of nicotine peddling were in place by the early 16th century: Pique the curiosity of novices. Lure them to take a few puffs. Then sit back and let addiction work its dark, lucrative magic.\n\nBy the 1960s, when I was a boy, the smoking habit was ubiquitous. I remember reading a mystery that referred to the smell of stale cigarette smoke and wondering what smell that was, exactly. Half the world smelled that way. People gave each other ashtrays as gifts. Many of our dads were military veterans, hooked courtesy of Uncle Sam himself, who packed cigarettes in their rations. Many moms smoked also; one brand of cigarettes was marketed specifically as a badge of female achievement: \u201cYou\u2019ve come a long way, baby.\u201d\n\n[Sign up to receive Opinions pieces in your inbox six days a week]\n\nPeople talk about the sex appeal of cigarettes in cinema, but I remember even more keenly the cigarettes of the movie-watchers. The beam of light from the projection room to the screen took nearly solid form as it passed through the blue haze. If you looked closely enough, you could see the film play out in miniature on slowly rising columns of carcinogenic toxins. It was mesmerizing.\n\nSome 30 percent of high school seniors smoked daily when I was in school, according to government data. By then, the health risks were well known: We referred to cigarettes as \u201ccancer sticks\u201d and \u201ccoffin nails\u201d between puffs. This mass addiction finally began to ebb. Juries and judges turned against Big Tobacco. In 1998, state officials across the country hammered out a $200 billion settlement with cigarette-makers that included a ban on most forms of advertising. With few enticements to pique their interest, kids have turned away. Today, only about 4 percent of high school students smoke cigarettes daily.\n\nI sometimes wonder whether the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back was an actual camel \u2014 or rather, a cartoon camel named Joe. In one of the most cynical marketing campaigns of all time, the maker of Camel cigarettes celebrated the 75th anniversary of the brand by pitching an anthropomorphic camel as the epitome of cool. When critics pointed out that children were the obvious target audience for a cartoon dressed like the Fonz \u2014 and that seducing children to start smoking a quarter-century after the surgeon general\u2019s definitive report on the deadly hazard of tobacco was flatly outrageous \u2014 the company\u2019s stubborn denials rang so hollow that the industry\u2019s last defenders slunk away.\n\nNow the Joe Camel moment has arrived for the United States\u2019 ill-considered vaping industry. So-called e-cigarettes (known officially as \u201celectronic nicotine delivery systems,\u201d or ENDS) gained federal approval as supposedly safer alternatives to combustible tobacco \u2014 and thus a potential life-saver for the roughly 30 million Americans who just can\u2019t kick the habit.\n\nBut no matter how solemnly leading manufacturers such as Juul profess their dedication to rescuing smokers, the dirty truth boils down to two words: flavored pods. What Joe Camel was to the coffin nail business, fruit-flavored, mint-flavored \u2014 even bubble-gum-flavored \u2014 nicotine pods are to the vape industry. They are proof of evil intent.\n\n[Follow Washington Post Opinions on Facebook]\n\nJuul\u2019s easily hidden cartridges and kid-friendly drug flavors go a long way toward explaining the epidemic of vaping in U.S. high schools and middle schools. This public-health tragedy has undone decades of progress in fighting the nicotine scourge. According to the latest statistics, thanks to vaping, nicotine use among students has climbed back to 1970s levels.\n\nThe only good news here is a much shorter learning curve. A quick backlash against Juul\u2019s kid-hooking tactics spurred the company to pull its most childish flavors from the market last year. (Off-brand fruit-flavored pods to fit Juul cartridges remain easy to find.) And on Wednesday, the Trump administration announced plans to ban most flavored e-cigarettes. Not a moment too soon.\n\nWith hundreds of cases of illness and at least six deaths tied to vaping, the idea of safe smoking is revealed as a lie. Smoking kills. It always has. And no cartoon face or minty-fresh flavoring can mask that macabre reality.\n\nRead more from David Von Drehle\u2019s archive.", "description": "E-cigarette manufacturers\u2019 kid-hooking tactics are wrong, period.", "authors": ["David Von Drehle", "Columnist Focusing On National Affairs", "September At Pm", "David Von Drehle Writes A Twice-Weekly Column For The Post.
