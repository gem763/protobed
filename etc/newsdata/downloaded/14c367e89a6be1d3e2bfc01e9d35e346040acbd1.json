Two civilians were killed and others were wounded, a militia spokesman and a local journalist said.\n\nTurkey\u2019s long-planned move to root out United States-allied Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria has accelerated rapidly since President Trump gave the operation a green light in a call with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey on Sunday.\n\nThe operation could open a dangerous new front in Syria\u2019s eight-year-old war, pitting two United States allies against each other and raising the specter of sectarian bloodletting. Even before it began, it had set off fierce debates in Washington over Mr. Trump\u2019s Syria policy.", "description": "Turkey began a military operation against a Kurdish-led militia in Syria after getting a green light from President Trump.
