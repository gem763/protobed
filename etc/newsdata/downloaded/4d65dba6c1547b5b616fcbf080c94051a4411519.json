Football.\n\nBetween that, the NFL\u2019s 28 other teams will play 14 games of their own during a full slate of games which should have football fans and fantasy players glued to their televisions and get Buffalo wings selling like they are chicken sandwiches from Popeyes.\n\nSo how do all 32 of those NFL teams stack up against one another entering the season?\n\nBelow you\u2019ll find our Ultimate
