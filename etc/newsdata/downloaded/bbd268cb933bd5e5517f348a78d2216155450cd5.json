That is why I consider yesterday\u2019s threats made by President (Recep Tayyip) Erdogan totally out of place,\u201d he added.\n\nErdogan made his comments on Thursday in the face of mounting condemnation from European governments of Ankara\u2019s long-threatened operation to enforce a buffer zone in northeastern Syria to accommodate some of the 3.6 million refugees currently living in Turkey.\n\n\u201cHey EU, wake up. I say it again: if you try to frame our operation there as an invasion, our task is simple: we will open the doors and send 3.6 million migrants to you,\u201d the Turkish leader said.\n\nUnder a 2016 agreement with the EU, Turkey agreed to prevent refugees from leaving towards Europe in exchange for six billion euros and visa-free travel for its citizens, but has frequently criticised the lack of assistance from Brussels.\n\nTusk condemned Turkey\u2019s offensive, launched Wednesday, saying it was \u201cof grave concern and should stop\u201d.\n\n\u201cA military intervention will only make matters worse,\u201d he added, saying it would exacerbate instability in the region, cause further civilian suffering and displacement as well as undermine the fight against the Islamic State group.", "description": "Nicosia (AFP) \u2013 EU Council President Donald Tusk on Friday condemned as attempted \u201cblackmail\u201d a threat by the Turkish president to allow", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/ef6453_eu-council-president-donald-tusk-accuses-turkey-attempting-weaponise-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
