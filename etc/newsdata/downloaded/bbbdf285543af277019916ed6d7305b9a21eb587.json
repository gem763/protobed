It has been noted for its disproportionately large Greek system. Several incidents in recent years, including the deaths of two underage students who had been drinking, led to lawsuits and sanctions against fraternities at the school.\n\nTwo days before the police report, on April 26, 2019, Emily, a sorority member at a nearby school, attended a party at Wabash\u2019s Phi Gamma Delta chapter, where she was allegedly raped by a member of the swimming and diving team. (Emily has since moved to attend school in another state, the complaint states.)\n\nThough Emily was \u201cvisibly intoxicated and unable to stand up without help,\u201d a man groped her breasts and then took her upstairs to a third-floor bedroom, according to the 16-page lawsuit she filed Monday in U.S. District Court in the Southern District of Indiana.\n\nWhen she next awoke, she was \u201clying on a bed, on her back, undressed,\u201d with her attacker on top of her, \u201cwith no memory of how she ended up there,\u201d according to the lawsuit. She felt the man\u2019s penis penetrating her, said \u201cit hurts,\u201d and told him to stop, but was \u201cunable to move\u201d or to physically resist, the complaint states.\n\nShe blacked out again, and awoke\u2014still unable to speak or move\u2014with the man\u2019s penis in her mouth, according to the suit.\n\nAnother sorority member, who witnessed Emily\u2019s level of intoxication and \u201cbecame concerned when she could no longer find\u201d her, went upstairs to look for her friend and was told not to enter the room because the man had a \u201cgirl in there,\u201d the complaint states. Behind the door, she found Emily and her attacker in the room, and she helped her sorority sister dress and get home, according to the documents.\n\nEmily\u2019s lawsuit, which names the alleged assailant and the fraternity as defendants, claims sexual battery, sexual assault, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligence. The Daily Beast has not identified the defendant by name because he has not yet been criminally charged and is not a public figure.\n\nThe day after the alleged assault, Emily went to the hospital for a rape kit, and the next day she went to the Crawfordsville Police Department to report the attack. Detective Lieutenant David Long, who interviewed Emily, told her that Wabash has no formal code of conduct, only a \u201cgentlemen\u2019s code,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\nLong allegedly added that the department has a \u201cclose working relationship\u201d with the college, which has \u201cin prior cases involving rape or sexual assault\u201d only removed students from \u201cmembership on athletic teams, scholarship, financial aid assistance, or fraternity membership,\u201d rather than expelling or suspending them.\n\nCrawfordsville Police Chief Mike Norman told The Daily Beast on Tuesday that the report on Emily\u2019s case was \u201csent to the prosecutor\u2019s office for review\u201d and that he could not confirm or comment on the remarks allegedly made by Long.\n\nEmily also filed a Title IX complaint at Wabash, which is still investigating the allegations, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that the fraternity \u201cgratuitously and voluntarily assumed a duty of care over\u201d Emily by inviting her to the party and offering her a ride to the fraternity house. That offer, according to the complaint, created \u201ca special relationship between the parties and a corresponding duty to act in the manner of a reasonably prudent person.\u201d For that reason, the organization allegedly \u201cbreached its duties by not taking reasonable precautions to prevent its members from committing acts of rape or sexual assault, or fostering or enabling an environment in which a foreseeable act of rape or sexual assault would be committed.\u201d\n\nEmily\u2019s lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory damages for her legal, medical, and psychological expenses and punitive damages for emotional distress, mental anguish, and pain and suffering. She has asked for a jury trial.\n\n\u201cIt is Wabash College policy not to comment on pending litigation,\u201d a spokesman for the school said Tuesday.\n\nThe national headquarters for Phi Gamma Delta did not respond to a request for comment from The Daily Beast.\n\n*Emily is identified by a different pseudonym in her lawsuit.
