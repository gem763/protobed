When black boys are killed, we need to say something. And when we don\u2019t say something, we\u2019re saying something.\"\n\nOn Monday, Franklin said the goal of the boycott was \"reconciliation and accountability.\"\n\n\"It is important for those in charge to be informed. Not only did they edit my speech, they edited the African-American experience.\"\n\n\"I'm not asking those in the gospel community to follow my decision. No, this is my personal decision to take a stand, and hold responsible those in positions of power to acknowledge the issues in our separate communities that have existed from colonialism to Jim Crow.\"\n\nGMA President and Executive Director Jackie Patillo issued a public response Monday, saying the organization was \"deeply apologetic for the missteps that happened relating to the editing of Kirk Franklin\u2019s Dove Awards acceptance speech.\"\n\nPatillo said the organization had to \"significantly edit\" the show to fit a 2-hour broadcast window, leading to the absence of \"many memorable moments and noteworthy portions of acceptance speeches.\"\n\n\"We accept the responsibility of our error. Although completely unintentional, we understand it caused great harm and deeply wounded many in the African American and Gospel community. As well, it left a general perception that we are not concerned with key social issues that affect people of color. It is not our intent to disregard or silence any of our artists, and we are deeply saddened by this perception and are committed to change this.\"\n\nTBN has now uploaded a full cut of the 2019 Dove Awards to its website, which includes Franklin's remarks in full. You can also see the full speech on the Doves' official YouTube channel.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/10/28/kirk-franklin-boycotts-dove-awards-speech-edited-atatiana-jefferson/2492641001/", "description": "The gospel star says the edited version cut out his remarks on\u00a0Atatiana Jefferson, who was shot and killed in her home by a Fort Worth police officer.", "authors": ["Dave Paulson", "Published P.M.
