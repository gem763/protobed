One of the individuals said he was so concerned by the whole affair that he reported it to a U.S. Embassy official in Ukraine months ago.\n\nDuring the same period they were pursuing the Naftogaz deal, Parnas and Fruman were coordinating with Giuliani to set up meetings with Ukrainian government officials and push for an investigation of the Bidens. Former Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is left. President Donald Trump is right\n\nWHO ARE THE THREE MEN AT THE CENTER OF THE NAFTOGAZ PLAN? At the center of the Naftogaz plan, according to three individuals familiar with the details, were three such businessmen: two Soviet-born Florida real estate entrepreneurs, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, and an oil magnate from Boca Raton, Florida, named Harry Sargeant III. Parnas and Fruman have made hundreds of thousands of dollars in political donations to Republicans, including $325,000 to a Trump-allied political action committee in 2018. This helped the relatively unknown entrepreneurs gain access to top levels of the Republican Party - including meetings with Trump at the White House and Mar-a-Lago. The two have also faced lawsuits from disgruntled investors over unpaid debts. During the same period they were pursuing the Naftogaz deal, the two were coordinating with Giuliani to set up meetings with Ukrainian government officials and push for an investigation of the Bidens. Sargeant, his wife and corporate entities tied to the family have donated at least $1.2 million to Republican campaigns and PACs over the last 20 years, including $100,000 in June to the Trump Victory Fund, according to federal and state campaign finance records. He has also served as finance chair of the Florida state GOP, and gave nearly $14,000 to Giuliani's failed 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko, left, lost his reelection bid to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, right\n\nThe Naftogaz supervisory board is supposed to be selected by the Ukrainian president's Cabinet in consultation with international institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, the United States and the European Union.\n\nIt must be approved by the Ukrainian Cabinet. Ukrainian officials perceived Perry's push to swap out the board as circumventing that established process, according to the person in the room.\n\nU.S. Energy Department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said Perry had consistently called for the modernization of Ukraine's business and energy sector in an effort to create an environment that will incentivize Western companies to do business there. She said Perry delivered that same message in the May meeting with Zelenskiy.\n\n'What he did not do is advocate for the business interests of any one individual or company,' Hynes said Saturday. 'That is fiction being pushed by those who are disingenuously seeking to advance a nefarious narrative that does not exist.'\n\nTIMELINE OF A PLAN TO INSTALL NEW MANAGEMENT AT NAFTOGAZ Trump and Giuliani allies were driving an attempt to change the senior management at Naftogazt, pictured EARLY MARCH Fruman, Parnas and Sargeant tout a plan to replace Naftogaz CEO Andriy Kobolyev with another senior executive at the company, Andrew Favorov, according to sources. The three approached Favorov while the Ukrainian executive was attending an energy industry conference in Texas. Parnas and Fruman told him they had flown in from Florida on a private jet to recruit him to be their partner in a new venture to export up to 100 tanker shipments a year of U.S. liquefied gas into Ukraine, where Naftogaz is the largest distributor, according to two people briefed on the details. Sargeant told Favorov that he regularly meets with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and that the gas-sales plan had the president's full support, according to the two people who said Favorov recounted the discussion to them. These conversations were recounted to AP by Dale W. Perry, an American who is a former business partner of Favorov. He told AP in an interview that Favorov described the meeting to him soon after it happened and that Favorov perceived it to be a shakedown. Perry, who is no relation to the energy secretary, is the managing partner of Energy Resources of Ukraine, which currently has business agreements to import natural gas and electricity to Ukraine. A second person who spoke on condition of anonymity also confirmed to the AP that Favorov had recounted details of the Houston meeting to him. According to Dale Perry and the other person, Favorov said Parnas told him Trump planned to remove U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and replace her with someone more open to aiding their business interests. Dale Perry told the AP he was so concerned about the efforts to change the management at Naftogaz and to get rid of Yovanovitch that he reported what he had heard to Suriya Jayanti, a State Department foreign service officer stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv who focuses on the energy industry. He also wrote a detailed memo about Favorov's account, dated April 12, which was shared with another current State Department official. Perry recently provided a copy of the April memo to AP. Jayanti declined to provide comment. Favorov also declined to comment. MARCH 24 Giuliani and Parnas gathered at the Trump International Hotel in Washington with Healy E. Baumgardner, a former Trump campaign adviser who once served as deputy communications director for Giuliani's presidential campaign and as a communications official during the George W. Bush administration. She is now listed as the CEO of 45 Energy Group, a Houston-based energy company whose website describes it as a 'government relations, public affairs and business development practice group'. This was a couple of weeks after the Houston meeting with Favorov, the Naftogaz executive. Giuliani, Parnas and Baumgardner were there to make a business pitch involving gas deals in the former Soviet bloc to a potential investor. This time, according to Giuliani, the deals that were discussed involved Uzbekistan, not Ukraine. 'I have not pursued a deal in the Ukraine. I don't know about a deal in the Ukraine. I would not do a deal in the Ukraine now, obviously,' said Giuliani, 'There is absolutely no proof that I did it, because I didn't do it.' During this meeting, Parnas again repeated that Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador in Kyiv, would soon be replaced, according to a person with direct knowledge of the gathering. She was removed two months later. In early March, Fruman, Parnas and Sargeant were touting a plan to replace Naftogaz CEO Andriy Kobolyev, left, with another senior executive at the company, Andrew Favorov, right, according to sources MAY Rick Perry traveled to Kyiv to serve as the senior U.S. government representative at the inauguration of the county's new president. In a private meeting with Zelenskiy, Perry pressed the Ukrainian president to fire members of the Naftogaz advisory board. Attendees left the meeting with the impression that Perry wanted to replace the American representative, Amos Hochstein, a former diplomat and energy representative who served in the Obama administration, with someone 'reputable in Republican circles,' according to someone who was in the room. A second meeting during the trip, at a Kyiv hotel, included Ukrainian officials and energy sector people. There, Perry made clear that the Trump administration wanted to see the entire Naftogaz supervisory board replaced, according to a person who attended both meetings. Perry again referenced the list of advisers that he had given Zelenskiy, and it was widely interpreted that he wanted Robert Bleyzer, a Ukrainian-American businessman from Texas, to join the newly formed board, the person said. Also on the list was Robert Bensh, another Texan who frequently works in Ukraine, the Energy Department confirmed. Gordon D. Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt D. Volker, then the State Department's special envoy to Ukraine, were also in the room, according to photographs reviewed by AP. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation, said he was floored by the American requests because the person had always viewed the U.S. government 'as having a higher ethical standard.' SEPTEMBER 30 As part of their impeachment inquiry, House Democrats subpoena Giuliani for documents and communications related to dozens of people, including Favorov, Parnas, Fruman and Baumgardner's 45 Energy Group. Baumgardner issued a written statement, saying: 'While I won't comment on business discussions, I will say this: this political assault on private business by the Democrats in Congress is complete harassment and an invasion of privacy that should scare the hell out of every American business owner.' Sargeant did not respond to a voice message left at a number listed for him at an address in Boca Raton. OCTOBER 4 Giuliani acknowledged Friday that he was among those pushing the president to replace the ambassador, a career diplomat with a history of fighting corruption. 'The ambassador to Ukraine was replaced,' he said. 'I did play a role in that.' But Giuliani refused to discuss the details of his business dealings, or whether he helped his associates in their push to forge gas sales contracts with the Ukrainian company. He did describe Sergeant as a friend and referred to Parnas and Fruman as his clients in a tweet in May. John Dowd, a former Trump attorney who now represents Parnas and Fruman, said it was actually the Naftogaz executives who approached his clients about making a deal. He says they then met with Rick Perry to get the Energy Department on board. 'The people from the company solicited my clients because Igor is in the gas business, and they asked them, and they flew to Washington and they solicited,' Dowd said. 'They sat down and talked about it. And then it was presented to Secretary Perry to see if they could get it together. 'It wasn't a shakedown; it was an attempt to do legitimate business that didn't work out.'\n\nHynes said the Ukrainian government had requested U.S. recommendations to advise the country on energy matters, and Perry provided those recommendations. She confirmed a Ukrainian-American businessman Robert Bleyzer was on the list.\n\nBleyzer, whose company is based in Houston, did not respond on Saturday to a voicemail seeking comment. Bensh also did not respond to a phone message.\n\nAs a former Texas governor, Perry has always had close ties to the oil and gas industry. He appointed Bleyzer to a two-year term on a state technologies fund board in 2009. The following year, records show Bleyzer donated $20,000 to Perry's reelection campaign.\n\nZelenskiy's office declined to comment on Saturday.\n\nIn an interview Friday with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Perry said that 'as God as my witness' he never discussed Biden or his son in meetings with Ukrainian or U.S. officials, including Trump or Giuliani.\n\n'This has been a very intense, a very focused push to get Ukraine to clean up the corruption,' Perry said in the interview. 'I can't go in good faith and tell a U.S. company, go and invest here, go and be involved if the corruption is ongoing.'\n\nHe did confirm he had had a conversation with Giuliani by phone, but a spokeswoman for the energy secretary declined to say when that call was or whether the two had discussed Naftogaz.", "description": "The businessmen and Republican donors touted connections to Giuliani and Trump, pictured, while trying to install new management at Ukraine's state gas company.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/04/19379220-0-image-a-25_1570419448312.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
