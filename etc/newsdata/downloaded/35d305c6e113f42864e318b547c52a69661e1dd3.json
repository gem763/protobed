Get a dog (Getty)\n\nIf you want to live longer, get a dog.\n\nThat\u2019s the message from a new study looking at the effects of man\u2019s best friend on living a long and happy life.\n\nPartly because owning a dog will keep you active for longer.\n\nOur four-legged friends have long been praised for their ability to help mental wellbeing, reducing anxiety and loneliness, but less has been reported about how they might have a positive effect on physical health.\n\nCombining patient data of 3.8 million people from multiple studies, including England, researchers found owning a dog can lead to better cardiovascular outcomes, especially for heart attack and stroke survivors who live alone.\n\nScientists at the American Heart Association say that compared to those without a pet dog, owners experienced a 24% reduced risk of all-cause mortality and are 65% less likely to die after a heart attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose who had suffered cardiovascular-related issues were also 31% less likely to pass away. The results support a separate study carried out by Sweden\u2019s Uppsala University, which showed a 33% reduced risk of death for heart attack patients living alone after being released from hospital if they owned a dog.\n\nA similar drop was seen among stroke patients once they were discharged, at 27% lower than those without a dog.\n\nOwning a dog leads to more physical activity and lower levels of anxiety and loneliness (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\n\u2018These two studies provide good, quality data indicating dog ownership is associated with reduced cardiac and all-cause mortality,\u2019 said Glenn N Levine, from the American Heart Association.\n\n\u2018While these non-randomised studies cannot \u2018prove\u2019 that adopting or owning a dog directly leads to reduced mortality, these robust findings are certainly at least suggestive of this.\u2019\n\nProfessor Tove Fall, from Uppsala University, said keeping a dog can also help because it is a good motivation for physical activity, but warned that further research is needed.\n\n\u2018The results of this study suggest positive effects of dog ownership for patients who have experienced a heart attack or stroke,\u201d she said. \u2018However, more research is needed to confirm a causal relationship and giving recommendations about prescribing dogs for prevention. Moreover, from an animal welfare perspective, dogs should only be acquired by people who feel they have the capacity and knowledge to give the pet a good life.\u2019\n\nThe study was published in the Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes journal.", "description": "Chalk one up for man's best friend", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1059650734_1570630283.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
