A ripple of expectation goes through the crowd as he strides across the cobbled town square, flanked by menacing bodyguards dressed in black.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with expressing our democratic opinion. We want Germany to remain German,\u201d he tells his supporters, to ecstatic cheers.\n\nMr H\u00f6cke is the most controversial figure in German politics. He is under observation by the country\u2019s intelligence services as a possible threat to the democratic order. His opponents say he is a Nazi, and German television has compared him to Hitler.\n\nBut to his supporters he is a hero. They have waited hours for him in the cold, windswept square of this small east German town, part of the ancestral home of the British Royal Family, and his bodyguards have to hold them back as they queue to take selfies with him.\n\nMr H\u00f6cke is only a regional politican, yet nobody in current German politics has built a personality cult to rival his.\n\nIf the polls are right, he is set to lead the nationalist Alternative for Germany party (AfD) to second place in regional elections in the eastern state of Thuringia on Sunday.\n\nAlmost of quarter of voters say they are prepared to back a man who has been compared to Hitler on national television.", "description": "It's clear there's something different about Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke from the moment he arrives in Gotha.", "authors": ["Justin Huggler", "Tom Welsh", "Julie Burchill", "Simon Heffer", "Daniel Hannan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/25/TELEMMGLPICT000213962474-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
