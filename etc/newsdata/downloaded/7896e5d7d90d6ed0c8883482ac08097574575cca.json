You can't believe what you are seeing,\" she said during an interview, as thousands of protesters started marching in the US financial capital.\n\n\"This is not just because of me,\" said the Swede, who has spurred teenagers and students around the world, mainly Europe, to strike from school every Friday under the rallying cry \"Fridays for future\".\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\n\"This is because thousands of local organisers who have spent I don't know how many hours. They worked very hard. I'm eternally grateful for what they are doing.\n\n\"I hope this will be another social tipping point that we show how many people are engaged, how many people are putting pressure on leaders, especially before this UN climate action summit,\" she added, referring to Monday's carbon emissions meeting.\n\nThousands gathered in Manhattan's Foley Square at midday (1600 GMT) to rally the one mile (1.6 kilometers) distance to Battery Park on the tip of the island.\n\nNew York authorities gave their blessing to the one million children in over 1,700 schools in the metropolis to miss school for the event.\n\nChildren carried placards that read \"There Is No Planet B\" and \"Make The Earth Great Again\", a twist on US President Donald Trump's rallying cry of \"Make America Great Again\".\n\nMs Thunberg is due to attend a summit on zero emissions at the UN headquarters in New York on Monday and said she hoped the size of the protests would spur world leaders into action.\n\n'TAKE RESPONSIBILITY'\n\n\"It's a great opportunity when they are gathered here,\" she told AFP at New York's city hall, before joining the march, adding that some leaders \"seem more determined than others\".\n\n\"They need to take their responsibility and do this and that's what we are going to try and push for.\n\n\"Now we have proven what we can do, now they have to prove what they can (do),\" she added.\n\nMs Thunberg has become a symbol for climate action since she began sitting outside the Swedish parliament in August 2018 calling for politicians to cut carbon emissions and curb global warming.\n\nShe sailed into New York on a zero-carbon yacht last month after refusing to fly because of the carbon emissions caused by planes.
