It is the same racism suffered by Bradley Wiggins, by Galen Rupp, or even Maria Sharapova. It is the racism of suspicion, of association, of uncertainty. So, not racism at all, really.\n\nFarah doesn\u2019t get asked difficult questions because he\u2019s black. He gets them because he has spent a large part of his career \u2014 the most productive, successful part, too \u2014 under the tutelage of a dirty coach. A man found guilty and banned for four years after a forensic investigation into his practices. Alberto Salazar.\n\nRupp gets the same questions because of his links with Salazar, and he\u2019s a white guy. So is Wiggins, who was pursued over the contents of a Jiffy bag, never adequately explained.\n\nMo Farah is facing questions after his former coach was received a ban for doping violations\n\nActually, if Farah wants to know why he gets quizzed, it really is whitey who is to blame. One Caucasian in particular: Lance Armstrong. No one is suggesting the two bear direct comparison, yet Armstrong\u2019s greatest crime was to spoil it for everybody, to make it harder to believe. Armstrong is the reason feats are no longer taken at face value.\n\nHe also displayed outrage, took great offence, and was affronted at being challenged. Then it turned out he had lied and acted and was cheating all along. And he never failed a drugs test. The trust in sport changed that day.\n\nSo, Farah is living with the consequence of Armstrong\u2019s legacy, and of a professional relationship he was warned about years ago; a relationship he chose and then chose not to end when he had the opportunity. That isn\u2019t racism, that\u2019s sport. That\u2019s ethics. For Farah to link the very legitimate questions he receives with racist tropes is a desperate ploy.\n\nNo doubt, like any black man in the public eye, he will have endured abuse. Yet racists do not need a reason beyond skin colour to sour the mood. Racists aren\u2019t waiting for a four-year investigation to deliver its findings before being motivated to act.\n\nSalazar (centre) with Farah (right) and Galen Rupp (left) pictured at the London 2012 Olympics\n\nIn the fall-out from the Salazar verdict, Paula Radcliffe was professionally damaged, too, for a conflict of interests as she publicly talked down the findings on national television. Was that a by-product of prejudice, too, or should we stop this self-serving convergence of ideas?\n\nBy advancing the thought that to question him is racist, Farah wants to shut down the debate.\n\nSerena Williams took the same line at the 2018 US Open, by positioning her rant at umpire Carlos Ramos as a defiant retort to sexism. Both stances are bogus.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t win, you\u2019ve already made up your mind about what you\u2019re going to write,\u2019 said Farah at his press conference prior to an eighth-placed finish at the Chicago Marathon. \u2018As much as I am nice to you, there is a clear agenda to this. I have seen it many times. I have seen it with Raheem Sterling, with Lewis Hamilton. I cannot win whatever I do.\u2019\n\nYet Sterling and Hamilton have never had doubts raised about their professional integrity. Sterling\u2019s concerns were with the media portrayal of his persona, his private life; Hamilton\u2019s too. Farah\u2019s issues are all about the track, the road, the training camp. He doesn\u2019t have anything in common with Sterling and Hamilton in that sense.\n\nFarah (pictured) has never tested positive for illegal drugs and split from Salazar back in 2017\n\nHe is being tackled solely on his employment of a rogue coach and its impact on his professional credibility. His connection is with fellow Olympians such as Wiggins, who has also suffered reputational damage as a result of troublesome associations.\n\nAt the weekend, a witness placed Farah in the same US apartment as Salazar and a box of testosterone. Again, there is no suggestion its contents were used by Farah, or that he knew of its existence \u2014 he was back in England when it was spotted. But there it is, sitting in the kitchen of a premises he shared with his coach, at a time his running improved immeasurably.\n\nThere is 97 seconds difference between the time he delivered in Chicago on Sunday and his first marathon time in 2014 while under Salazar and the Nike Oregon Project. There will be 97 reasons for that discrepancy, too. Technical reasons, maybe tactical reasons, some hugely complex, some as simple as the passing of five years.\n\nYet as unfair as that might seem on an athlete who has never failed a test, there are questions. This is not racism. This is what happens if you pal around with drug cheats.\n\nThe long distance runner is being tackled solely on his employment of a rogue coach\n\nSunderland were in a play-off place the day they sacked manager Jack Ross. They had 19 points, trailing Wycombe in the automatic promotion slots by four, but with a game in hand. The owners no doubt thought Ross should have got them up last season, and was threatening to fall short again, but it\u2019s early days.\n\nHe had lost two matches all season, and just ten in 75 games. Sunderland also have the biggest budget in League One and clearly felt they are not getting the return they deserve. Some might argue they surely are.\n\nGareth Southgate is too smart to do without James Maddison completely. He\u2019s also smart enough to know exactly what to do with him right now. Let him stew.\n\nWhether it is fair to blame Marco Silva for all of Everton\u2019s recent troubles, there is one statistic that should be of enormous concern to both coach and club. In the 22 matches in which Everton have gone behind on his watch \u2014 so roughly 43 per cent of his games \u2014 not once have they come back to win. Managers should affect matches. Silva, it seems, cannot.\n\nEverton have never come from behind to win a game under manager Marco Silva\n\nKlopp the right winner\n\nIn a new book, Jurgen Klopp returns to one of his favourite subjects: Brexit. Unsurprisingly, he\u2019s a Remainer. Yet not in the centrist, liberal way fondly imagined.\n\nFootball people don\u2019t tack left as a rule. Theirs is an extreme meritocracy. The best man plays, others get left behind. It reflects in their politics.\n\nHere is Klopp\u2019s take on Brexit, and immigration. You may be surprised.\n\n\u2018In football it\u2019s clear: the best player plays. It\u2019s the same outside football. If you didn\u2019t bother listening at school and you don\u2019t have any education or skills, you can\u2019t expect to get a good job. And when somebody turns up from another country who has worked hard and studied economics or whatever, they don\u2019t get the job because they are black or foreign. They get the job because they are the better candidate. And they\u2019re not taking your job. If you have no future, that\u2019s your problem, nobody else\u2019s.\u2019\n\nThe irony is, this is the man who chimes perfectly with the city of Liverpool. Yet, by the sounds of it, he would also fit in neatly on the right wing of the Conservative party, too. Just not on Brexit.\n\nJurgen Klopp, pictured in Dortmund on Thursday, gave his take on Brexit and immigration\n\nJapan's typhoon season should not have come as a big surprise\n\nThere have been a lot of folk coming over all meteorological on the subject of Japanese typhoons. Usually, those that have bought World Rugby\u2019s line about October storms being a freak occurrence.\n\nThis isn\u2019t true. There are 142 typhoons lively enough to have their own webpage; mostly recent, but a few of the larger historic ones, too. Either way, it\u2019s a representative sample. And typhoons are weeks in the making, so some stretch across individual months.\n\nThe relevant factor is when they hit Japan. So here\u2019s the breakdown: April\u2019s total: 1, May: 6, June: 6, July: 20, August: 39 \u2014 good luck at the Olympics everybody, by the way \u2014 September: 46, October: 21, November: 3.\n\nMeaning the Rugby World Cup began in Japan\u2019s peak month for typhoon events and continued through the month in which roughly 15 per cent of its typhoons occur. October.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis was one of the country's worst ever tropical cyclones and killed 23 people\n\nJapan\u2019s season runs later than much of Asia\u2019s. While the strength of Typhoon Hagibis might have been exceptional, its timing was not. If World Rugby had held their tournament in March and April and suffered a repeat of Typhoon Kujira which, in 2003, became the earliest on record to make landfall in Japan, that would be an anomaly and the organisers might consider themselves highly unfortunate.\n\nThis was poor planning and a reluctance to disturb rugby\u2019s calendar for the greater good. At best unimaginative, at worst lazy and selfish.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s done now, the tournament otherwise is great. Let\u2019s learn a lesson and get on with it.\n\nTheir match with Namibia unavoidably cancelled, Canada\u2019s rugby players joined in with the rescue and recovery operation in Kamaishi instead. Kamaishi is the city devastated by the tsunami in 2011, that has rebuilt around the uplift of being World Cup hosts.\n\nThe people of Japan have put an extraordinary amount into welcoming the world to this tournament. It must have felt good to give something back.\n\nCanada's players volunteer to clean a road in Kamaishi after their match was cancelled\n\nThere's always an idiot, Borislav\n\nIndisputably, it is very important to have zero tolerance of racism; but that doesn\u2019t mean a country, an industry, a sport, can ever achieve zero racism. There will always be one, and probably more. Yet the inability to control misguided individuals or minority groups should not limit discussion.\n\nEquivalency is the problem. The notion that incidents in isolation which occur in English football \u2014 and invariably get called out instantly \u2014 limit freedom to comment on wider problems elsewhere.\n\nEngland\u2019s match in Sofia on Monday night was played at a partially closed stadium because of repeated instances of racism. These date from Bulgaria\u2019s matches against Kosovo and the Czech Republic in June and were far from a first offence.\n\nMonday's match was played at a partially closed stadium because of instances of racism\n\nFans at Levski Sofia have a history of far right associations, including wishing Hitler a happy birthday in 2013 and aiming racist chants at their own player, Basile De Carvalho, from Guinea-Bissau. In 2014, they displayed a banner, \u2018Say Yes To Racism\u2019.\n\nThey were forced to play two matches behind closed doors last season after further incidents of racism in defeat to FC Vaduz of Switzerland in the Europa League.\n\nUnderstandably, the preamble to last night\u2019s match included talk of whether England\u2019s players would leave the field if subjected to racist abuse. The Bulgarian federation complained and Gareth Southgate went into full equivalency mode. \u2018I have to say again, we don\u2019t look at other countries in a way that we don\u2019t shine a mirror on our own,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018What happened in Hartlepool a couple of weeks ago was probably worse than things I\u2019ve seen or heard about in many other countries.\u2019\n\nWhat happened in Hartlepool was a disgrace, yes. But what happened in Hartlepool involved a small group of supporters racially abusing a player from Dover in a National League game, behaviour that was condemned instantly by both clubs, both managers and many players on social media.\n\nThat didn't prevent the game being marred by more disgraceful scenes of racism\n\nIt certainly does not compare to having parts of the national stadium shut. What subsequently unfolded in Sofia last night confirmed this. A vile atmosphere, Nazi salutes and racist abuse from sinister black-clad thugs almost led to the game being called off. To the credit of England\u2019s players it was not.\n\nDenounce the behaviour of a large number of England fans acting boorishly abroad. Denounce events in Amsterdam, in Seville, in Porto.\n\nYet all our mealy-mouthed equivalency on racism did was empower Borislav Mihaylov, president of the Bulgarian Football Union, to say: \u2018I don\u2019t think we have as big a problem like England do. In the Bulgarian championship we have not had such problems while there have been incidents in all levels of English football involving racism.\u2019\n\nHis words were empty and self-serving then, and seem appalling now. Yet, equivalency meant racism became just another English moan, and not an issue demanding attention. It laid the ground for the travesty in Sofia. It will remain that way while we continue equating one misguided individual to many of them.\n\nBulgaria FA chief Borislav Mihaylov complained to UEFA about England's growing concerns\n\nShaun Harvey, the former chief executive of the Football League, has revealed his organisation held talks about holding the draw for the Carabao Cup in space. \u2018Genuinely, we opened up discussions with the International Space Station,\u2019 he says. Just so you know they weren\u2019t completely distracted by trivia as Bury went down the tubes.\n\nBlame the Scots for inflicting mediocrity\n\nScotland were prime movers among the nations pushing for the European Championship to expand to the point of irrelevance.\n\nRather than improve and qualify, by right, for a taut, high-quality, 16-team tournament, they no doubt thought it would be easier to lobby UEFA to allow 24 participants.\n\nAs there was money involved, it was their easiest win in years.\n\nSo now we have a dog\u2019s dinner method of qualification, and a finals competition that lets third-place finishers in groups of four progress to a superfluous knockout round. Mediocrity won.\n\nScotland's Robert Snodgrass looks dejected following their defeat to Russia last week\n\nAs for Scotland, they sit 15 points off Belgium, 12 from Russia, and a point behind Cyprus, fourth in Group I. Settling is never the way forward.\n\nThe old format of the Euros promoted ambition and excellence. Scottish football is home to neither. A pity they had to take the most competitive tournament in international football with them.", "description": "MARTIN SAMUEL - CHIEF SPORTS WRITER: It is a very peculiar form of racism that affects Mo Farah.
