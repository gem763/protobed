At a time when simply reading the news is an exercise in exhaustion, anxiety, and fear, it\u2019s no surprise that so many of our tales about the future are dark amplifications of the greatest terrors of the present. But now more than ever, we also need the reverse: stories that inspire hope.\n\nThat\u2019s why, starting on January 14th, we\u2019ll be publishing Better Worlds: 10 original fiction stories, five animated adaptations, and five audio adaptations by a diverse roster of science fiction authors who take a more optimistic view of what lies ahead in ways both large and small, fantastical and everyday.\n\nGrowing up, I was surrounded by optimistic science fiction \u2014 not only the idealism of television shows like Star Trek, but also the pulpy, thrilling adventures of golden age science fiction comics. They imagined worlds where the lot of humanity had been improved by our innovations, both technological and social. Stories like these are more than just fantasy and fabulism; they are articulations of hope. We need only look at how many tech leaders were inspired to pursue careers in technology because of Star Trek to see the tangible effect of inspirational fiction. (Conversely, Snow Crash author Neal Stephenson once linked the increasing scarcity of optimistic science fiction to \u201cinnovation starvation.\u201d)\n\nBetter Worlds is partly inspired by Stephenson\u2019s fiction anthology Hieroglyph: Stories and Visions for a Better Future as well as Octavia\u2019s Brood: Science Fiction Stories from Social Justice Movements, a 2015 \u201cvisionary fiction\u201d anthology that is written by a diverse array of social activists and edited by Walidah Imarisha and adrienne maree brown. Their premise was simple: whenever we imagine a more equitable, sustainable, or humane world, we are producing speculative fiction, and this creates a \u201cvital space\u201d that is essential to forward progress.\n\nThe stories of Better Worlds are not intended to be conflict-free utopias or Pollyanna-ish paeans about how tech will solve everything; many are set in societies where people face challenges, sometimes life-threatening ones. But all of them imagine worlds where technology has made life better and not worse, and characters find a throughline of hope. We hope these stories will offer you the same: inspiration, optimism, or, at the very least, a brief reprieve that makes you feel a little bit better about what awaits us in the future \u2014 if we find the will to make it so.\n\n\u2014Laura Hudson, culture editor, The Verge\n\nBetter Worlds stories\n\n\u201cA Theory of Flight\u201d By Justina Ireland | Video by All In Pixel A daring plan to build an open-source rocket could help more people escape Earth.\n\n\u201cOnline Reunion\u201d By Leigh Alexander A young journalist chronicling a vintage e-pet reunion gets more than she expected.\n\n\u201cA Model Dog\u201d By John Scalzi | Video by Joel Plosz An overbearing CEO demands that his employees engineer a solution to his dad\u2019s aging dog.\n\n\u201cMonsters Come Howling in Their Season\u201d By Cadwell Turnbull An island commonwealth integrates an AI to defend itself against a worsening hurricane season.\n\n\u201cSt. Juju\u201d By Rivers Solomon | Video by Allen Laseter A young woman must choose between her secure enclave and the one she loves.\n\n\u201cThe Burn\u201d By Peter Tieryas As people around the world fall victim to The Burn, AR researchers begin to suspect a pattern.\n\n\u201cA Sun Will Always Sing\u201d By Karin Lowachee | Video by Yeah Haus A spacecraft carrying precious cargo embarks on a lifetime journey to a better world.\n\n\u201cSkin City\u201d By Kelly Robson A street performer gets into trouble after falling for a radical privacy devotee.\n\n\u201cMove the World\u201d By Carla Speed McNeil Once in your life, you can choose to pull a lever that resets the world \u2014 but will it make things better?\n\n\u201cOverlay\u201d By Elizabeth Bonesteel | Video by Device A father undertakes a dangerous mission to save his captured son.\n\n\u201cMachine of Loving Grace\u201d By Katherine Cross An AI designed to moderate video games takes on a life of its own.", "description": "Better Worlds is 10 original fiction stories, five animated adaptations, and five audio adaptations by a diverse roster of science fiction authors who take a more optimistic view of what lies ahead in ways both large and small, fantastical and everyday.", "authors": ["Verge Staff", "Feb"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YP8l6rdtR9npvRNEAxApJtXehHw=/0x38:1920x1043/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13601412/VRG_BW_Social.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-05"}
