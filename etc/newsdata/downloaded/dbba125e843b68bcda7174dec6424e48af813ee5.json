The area was sold to the council long before the Oran Mor came into being.\n\nA petition has been running since 2011, urging the council to hand the land over to the Oran Mor - but bosses have cited pedestrian footfall and damage to the trees among their reasons for refusing the bid.\n\nThey said an advertising drum was also refused permission for the same reason.\n\nImage copyright Mark Wild/Oran Mor Image caption The Oran Mor at the top of Byres Road\n\n\"I have serious frustrations with this,\" Mr Beattie said. \"The north elevation has sat in limbo for 40-50 years.\n\n\"I thought here's the perfect opportunity to put in the statues for Billy and Chic and got carried away with that.\"\n\nThe idea for the statue came from a meeting between Mr Beattie and artist David Annan - who were originally discussing a statue commission for Scots poet Edwin Morgan.\n\nThey realised they were both mutual friends of Billy Connolly and the family of Chic Murray, who died in 1985.\n\nThey immediately decided to move forward with a tribute to the two.\n\nImage copyright Kirsty Anderson Herald and Times Group\n\nMr Beattie said he has the backing of Billy, as well as the approval of Chic's daughter Annabelle and son Douglas.\n\n\"What Billy would tell you is Chic was his idol,\" said Colin. \"Even Chic's joke about the woman's nose that got stuck in the rail track - that inspired Billy to do his bike joke.\n\n\"That's why we had Chic standing on the see-saw and the fulcrum off-centre, with Billy always looking up. Their dynamic dictates that.\n\n\"I'm sure Billy would concur that Chic Murray is his soulmate.\"\n\nOn marriage:\n\nChic Murray: \"If it weren't for marriage, husbands and wives would have to fight with strangers.\"\n\nBilly Connolly: \"Marriage is a wonderful invention: then again, so is a bicycle repair kit.\"\n\nOn science:\n\nChic Murray: \"If something's neither here nor there, where the hell is it?\"\n\nBilly Connolly: \"Why should I learn algebra? I've no intention of ever going there.\"\n\nOn food:\n\nChic Murray: \"Kippers - fish that like a lot of sleep.\"\n\nBilly Connolly: \"A well-balanced person has a drink in each hand.\"\n\nSocial history\n\nOver the course of his career Mr Beattie has run a number of notable venues in and around Glasgow including the Lismore Bar and the Renfrew Ferry - all, he says, contained pieces of artwork that nodded to Scottish culture.\n\nHe believes the statue of Billy and Chic could become one of the country's significant landmarks if plans ever move forward.\n\nHe said: \"Public art gets into your bones and this work could be as important to Glasgow as Greyfriar's Bobby is to Edinburgh or Molly Malone in Dublin.\n\n\"I've had numerous venues and what I like to put in them is a bit of social history as reference point - so when you're inside it moves the scope of conversation on from things like Rangers and Celtic.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The 100th anniversary of Chic Murray's birthday occurs later this year\n\nEight years on, the desire to place the statue has not waned - patrons of the Oran Mor are still urged to sign Mr Beattie's petition.\n\nUnsurprisingly, several signatures were given following the venue's run of Chic Murray: A Funny Place for a Window. The show, which previously ran at the Oran Mor's A Play, A Pie and A Pint series, has also been aired on BBC Scotland in a new theatre series.\n\nIt comes ahead of the 100th anniversary of Chic's birthday - 6 November, 1919.\n\nAfter a brief spell in Edinburgh, the statue is now in storage in a warehouse in Lanarkshire.\n\nWhether it will see the light of day again remains to be seen.\n\nAll images subject to copyright.", "description": "In 2011 a statue was built depicting two of Scotland's great comedians - but it has never left storage.", "authors": ["Mary Mccool", "Bbc Scotland News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3807/production/_108634341_gettyimages-561679737.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
