His reaction was wrong in that moment,\" added Emery.\n\n\"We need to be clever in our minds and create habits under pressure for our minds to be clearer. We can play with our hearts and can be hot in difficult moments, but our minds must be clever.\"\n\n'Pressure and criticism'\n\nXhaka has made 143 appearances during his four seasons at Arsenal after joining from German side Borussia Monchengladbach in 2016.\n\nHe was named as Arsenal's captain in September by Emery following former captain Laurent Koscielny's exit to Bordeaux.\n\n\"He is mature, he has experience,\" said Emery after Xhaka's official appointment.\n\n\"We are living all the time under pressure and criticism, as coaches and players. The most important thing is to stand up each moment, go ahead with his quality and behavior and commitment. In the dressing room the players voted for him as first leader.\"\n\nEarlier this season Xhaka was also jeered by Arsenal fans after being substituted in the second half of the 3-2 win over Aston Villa.\n\n\"He should have apologised already.\"\n\n\n\nWhat did you make of Granit Xhaka's reaction to the #AFC fans? pic.twitter.com/MaQr0Kl5PF \u2014 Match of the Day (@BBCMOTD) October 28, 2019\n\n\"I spoke with him,' said Emery after the Villa game. \"We want to change that opinion outside. The respect he has inside [the club] is very very important.\"\n\nAfter the latest run-in with Arsenal's fans, Emery refused to comment on whether Xhaka would remain as captain.\n\n\"We need the supporters and when they criticize us, we need to stand up,\" he said. \"When they applaud us, we need to stay calm, because they are our supporters and they are the reason for our work.\n\n\"We want to give them our opinion and your opinion, and because we have a lot of followers here and the world. We need our players to stay calm in all the moments, when we're applauded and when we're criticized.\"", "description": "As captain's performances go it probably wasn't the one Arsenal manager Unai Emery was looking for when he appointed Granit Xhaka skipper of the Gunners in September.", "authors": ["Ben Morse", "For Cnn"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191028101811-granit-xhaka-crystal-palace-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
