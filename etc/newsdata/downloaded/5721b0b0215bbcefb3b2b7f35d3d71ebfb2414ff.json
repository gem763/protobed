Rifling through the pages of our favourite issues of glossy magazines, our eyes would meet those of other-worldly creatures, almost plastic in their perfection. And while such imagery can certainly still be found within the field of fashion photography, more often than not, modern shoots boast a dynamism and an excitement that would fool us into believing that we, too, could be the women in the pictures.\n\nThis stark departure from the rigid magazine standards of contrived beauty was largely the result of one man, who spent his entire career working to provide a welcome antidote. Peter Lindbergh, the influential fashion photographer who died on Tuesday at the age of 74, was a staunch critic of airbrushing and the selfie culture of today. Recognised as one of the most prolific photographers of his generation, Lindbergh\u2019s career spanned almost 50 years and saw him work with countless fashion designers, supermodels, internationally renowned magazines and royalty.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

He leaves a big void.\u201d\n\nBorn in Lissa of Nazi-occupied Poland in 1944, Lindbergh spent his childhood in Duisburg before working as a window dresser for a local department store and enrolling at the Berlin Academy of Fine Arts in the early 1960s. While his fellow students at the academy spent their time painting portraits, Lindbergh flouted convention, instead choosing to follow in the footsteps of his idol, Vincent van Gogh, by hitchhiking all the way to Arles, before temporarily relocating to Spain and north Africa.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Peter Lindbergh's best Vogue covers 1/10 November 1988, American Vogue Anna Wintour's first cover for American Vogue was era-defining in more ways than one. Namely because Wintour subverted a decade-long tradition of only putting elaborate occasionwear on magazine covers. Instead, she chose a beaded Christian Lacroix jacket and stone-wash Guess jeans. The smiley photograph that Lindbergh captured of Israeli model Michaela Bercu lends itself to a similarly unvarnished aesthetic, one that soon became Lindbergh's trademark. Vogue 2/10 September 1990, British Vogue This cover marks a rare moment for Lindbergh, given that its star is not a supermodel. Now an established jewellery designer, Jade Jagger is perhaps best known for being the daughter of Rolling Stones front man, Mick Jagger. She was just 19 years old at the time of this shoot and had just left boarding school in Wiltshire. Here, Lindbergh shot her unusually close-up, erasing the outline of her face to produce a truly unique image. Vogue 3/10 January 1990, British Vogue Ask any Vogue fan which is their favourite cover of all time, and most will name this one. Lindbergh famously photographed Naomi, Linda, Tatjana, Christy and Cindy at the height of their fame. What's more, he allowed their beauty to stand on its own, eschewing glittering gowns and garish makeup for jeans, stretchy tops and bare faces. Vogue 4/10 March 1990, British Vogue If anyone can put a horse on the cover of British Vogue without making it look like an equestrian catalogue, it's Lindbergh. For this special international collections issue, he photographed Danish supermodel Helena Christensen with a majestic horse whose coat matched the optic whiteness of her column dress by Giorgio di Sant'Angelo.

For the issue, which was dubbed \"Forces for Change\", Meghan chose women hailing from politics, film and fashion. Each portrait was taken in a different style with different proportions, but all of them paid homage to Lindbergh's signature natural style. AFP/Getty\n\nAfter spending two years assisting German photographer Hans Lux, Lindbergh found his calling as a photographer and opened his own photography studio in 1971, joining the Stern magazine family alongside the likes of contemporary creatives Guy Bourdin and Helmut Newton.\n\nHe really did capture the natural beauty within each of his subjects who sat for him, almost like they were in suspended animation Alex Longmore\n\nUnlike much of the fashion photography of the time, which was often excessively retouched, Lindbergh became known for his humanist approach through which he challenged and redefined traditional beauty standards by asking his models to wear little-to-no makeup and have \u201cthe guts\u201d to be themselves. \u201cThis should be the responsibility of photographers today to free women, and finally everyone, from the terror of youth and perfection,\u201d he once said.\n\nIt was this refusal to bow to the glossy perfection associated with fashion publications that really propelled Lindbergh to notoriety. \u201cAs he often stated, his intention was to show \u2018real women\u2019, untouched and un-photoshopped and his shots suggest an artless lack of styling, while achieving an emotional intensity through dramatic use of chiaroscuro and abstracted contexts,\u201d says Dr Harriet Atkinson, fashion historian and professor at the University of Brighton.\n\nAlex Longmore, celebrity stylist, agrees, adding that Lindbergh became as adored for his fashion photography as he did his moving and emotive portraiture. \u201cFavouring black and white imagery over colour, he really did capture the natural beauty within each of his subjects who sat for him, almost like they were in suspended animation,\u201d she explains.\n\nLindbergh\u2019s instantly recognisable style saw him capture intimate and unpolished portraits of some of the industry\u2019s biggest stars, with everyone from Kate Moss and Gigi Hadid to the Duchess of Sussex posing for him in the space of his long career.\n\nHowever, the photographer was perhaps best known for his iconic Vogue covers, including the January 1990 issue of British Vogue that saw supermodels Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Tatjana Patitz, Cindy Crawford and Christy Turlington pose together for the very first time. The image went on to become known as \u201cthe birth certificate of the supers\u201d and sealed Lindbergh\u2019s status as a revolutionary in his field.\n\nAccording to Lisa Lockwood, news director at WWD, Lindbergh\u2019s work appeared to mark the beginning of the era of the celebrity supermodel while simultaneously redefining the image of the contemporary woman. \u201cPeter Lindbergh\u2019s photographs reflected the time we live in and were more about who the women were, as opposed to what they were wearing,\u201d she reflects\n\n\u201cHis images had a truthfulness to them and he seemed to have an affinity for the understated and non-glossy that permeated his work.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment persisted through the years, culminating in his most recent cover for British Vogue which came out just last month. Lindbergh was selected by Meghan Markle, who guest edited the September issue, to photograph 15 trailblazers, including Hollywood stars such as Salma Hayek and Jane Fonda, climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg and New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Arden.\n\nAt the time, Lindbergh explained that the word \u201cnatural\u201d was the key message behind the shoot, telling British Vogue: \u201cI hate retouching, I hate make-up. The number of beautiful women who have asked me to lengthen their legs or move their eyes further apart\u2026 you would not believe,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a culture of madness.\u201d\n\nAside from Vogue, Lindbergh worked with some of the most prestigious fashion brands and magazines since the late 1970\u2019s, including Rolling Stone, Vanity Fair, Dior and Prada. He was also commissioned to shoot the iconic Pirelli calendar on three occasions in 1996, 2002 and 2017, making him the only photographer in the calendar\u2019s 50-year history to do so.\n\nIn 2017, he photographed a number of stars for Pirelli using barely any makeup or styling, stating that he hoped to \u201cremind everyone that there\u2019s a beauty that\u2019s more real and truthful and not manipulated by commercial or any other interests. Beauty speaks about individuality, courage to be yourself, and your very own sensibility \u2013 that\u2019s my definition of a woman today,\u201d he said at a press conference at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s the goal of the calendar \u2013 to the show the woman. And not this stretched, manipulated, emptied [person] you see in the magazines today.\u201d\n\nToday, much of Lindbergh\u2019s work can be seen lining the walls of prestigious museums and galleries, including the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, Pimpidou in Paris and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. And, while the photographer became best known for his simple and revealing portraits, he also immersed himself into other creative ventures such as motion pictures.\n\nLindbergh also directed a number of critically acclaimed films and documentaries throughout his career, including Models, The Film (1991) and Inner Voices (1999) which won the Best Documentary Prize at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in 2000.\n\nThe passing of the influential photographer has been observed by a number of celebrities who have worked with and admired Lindbergh throughout his career. Upon receiving the news, Edward Enninful, British Vogue editor-in-chief, said: \u201cPeter Lindbergh was both a visionary photographer and a dear friend. His ability to see real beauty in people, and the world, was ceaseless, and will live on through the images he created. He will be missed by everyone who knew him, worked with him or loved one of his pictures.\u201d\n\nMeghan Markle, who worked with Lindbergh on several occasions including for her Vanity Fair cover in 2017, paid tribute to the photographer on Instagram. Alongside a black-and-white photograph of the pair embracing, the caption read: \u201cThe Duchess of Sussex had worked with Peter in the past and personally chose him to shoot the 15 women on the cover for the September issue of British Vogue, which she guest edited. There is no other photographer she considered to bring this meaningful project to life. Forces for Change was the one of the esteemed photographer\u2019s final published projects. He will be deeply missed.\u201d\n\nIn an age seemingly defined by deceptive and often problematic imagery, Lindbergh\u2019s approach to photography felt like a breath of fresh air, perhaps more so today more than ever before. So much so, that the impact of his remarkable and boundary-pushing photography promises to serve as an inspiration for many years to come.", "description": "Airbrushed, impossibly flawless images of models in stiff, unnatural poses were once the USP of\u00a0fashion\u00a0shoots.
