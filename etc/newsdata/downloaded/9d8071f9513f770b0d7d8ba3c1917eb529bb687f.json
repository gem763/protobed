Trump said Liu\u2019s team was coming to Washington \u201cto make a deal\u201d.\n\nTrump impeachment: Why is the US president in trouble over a phone call?\n\nMinutes later, however, his forecast of both sides successfully brokering a comprehensive deal this week had changed to \u201cmaybe\u201d and then to \u201cprobably unlikely\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s position on the Hong Kong protests has also been difficult to pin down.\n\nTrump, who had previously avoided weighing in on the unrest and called it an internal matter for China to handle alone, gave his strongest statement on the situation during the United Nations General Assembly meetings in September, when he warned that how China chose to handle the situation \u201cwill say a great deal about its role in the world in the future\u201d.\n\nOn Monday, the US leader said that Hong Kong was \u201cvery important as a world hub\u201d, and repeated a suggestion he first made in August for Xi to meet personally with \u201cleaders\u201d of the city\u2019s pro-democracy movement, which features no prominent leadership.\n\nAppearing to enjoy the fact that protesting Hong Kongers have waved US flags and brandished signs that made direct references to him, Trump applauded both the \u201csignage\u201d and the \u201cspirit\u201d of demonstrators, and suggested that diminishing crowd sizes on the city\u2019s streets were a sign of progress.\n\nYet recent weeks have only seen tensions between protesters and police in Hong Kong flare, punctuated by the shootings of two young demonstrators with live police rounds and the enactment over the weekend of emergency laws banning the use of face masks in public.", "description": "The US President said it would be a 'bad' thing for negotiations and denied reports that he promised Xi Jinping he would stay silent on HK", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/0a3c6810-e949-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4imagehires084932.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
