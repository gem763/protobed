It was actually going to be more than a study. It was going to be a continuing effort to portray the kind of influence that the Communist Party had over U.S. corporations, and provide that [information and data] in a way that could be accessible to the public, like a transparency initiative.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\nSpalding continued, \u201cAfter about a year, I had also recruited some funders for this, and so when it got down to the very end \u2014 at the very end \u2014 the think tank basically decided not to pursue the project, and quite frankly, it was because many of their donors had relationships with the Chinese Community Party. It was not just think tanks. It was also law firms that I reached out to, very high-end top law firms in New York and in DC that essentially said, \u2018We can\u2019t help. We talked to our partners, and we don\u2019t want to anger our Chinese clients,\u2019 and so it was pervasive. I already knew that corporations had been influenced, and that\u2019s why I wanted to run this transparency initiative.\u201d\n\nCombating China\u2019s political influence within America requires private sector cooperation, added Spalding. He warned, \u201cThe private sector had been essentially incentivized by the lure of profits from 1.4 billion Chinese and the payoffs that they were receiving \u2026 to essentially do the Communist Party\u2019s bidding.\u201d\n\nTariffs on Chinese exports must be made permanent in order to incentivize corporate investment in American manufacturing, determined Spalding.\n\n\u201cWe had put tariffs back on China because they clearly don\u2019t have a market economy,\u201d Spalding said, \u201c[but] because those tariffs aren\u2019t permanent \u2026 we\u2019re not seeing manufacturing capacity return to the United States. No corporation will do the investment, because they think as soon as either [Donald Trump] is gone or we have some kind of deal [with China], the tariffs will be gone.\u201d\n\nThe status quo of globalization facilitates capital outflows from America to China, Spalding noted. \u201c[Globalization] created this unholy alliance between those who were getting enriched by these higher profit margins on their products and the country that had the policy that incentivizes them to do so,\u201d he said. Predictions of China\u2019s democratization and liberalization via its deeper integration within the global economy did not come to be, he added.\n\nChina leveraged the \u201celements of globalization\u201d towards enhancing its geopolitical position, estimated Spalding, highlighting \u201ctrade, finance, investment, immigration, media, politics, the Internet, [and] academia.\u201d Asymmetrical policies and regulations between the U.S. and China, particularly with respect to political and economic openness, facilitated China\u2019s geopolitical ascendance, he added.\n\n\n\n\u201c[An] uneven policy in regulation and in legal framework \u2026 was built in their system and built in our system,\u201d Spalding stated, \u201cand since our system wasn\u2019t built to actually protect the American people or industry, [China\u2019s] system became clearly dominant, and you can\u2019t really blame American businesses, because our system says that executives and [board of directors] have a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders. Yhe Chinese Communist Party set the conditions in China, and our government set the conditions in the United States, and then you just run the clock, and if you run the clock, everybody goes to where it makes sense to make money, because that\u2019s the business of globalization and international business, and the way you make money in this current system is to align yourself with how the Chinese Communist Party has essentially set up their rules.\u201d\n\nMansour asked if Joe Biden and his youngest son, Hunter Biden, are illustrative of China\u2019s procurement of political influence via development of financial relationships with politicians\u2019 family members.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about the complicity, here,\u201d said Mansour. \u201cI can understand why our business leaders did this, because our government indicated to them \u2014 certainly from the Clinton administration on down \u2014 that this is the way we\u2019re going to go. China\u2019s opened up to do business, and if we go and do business with them, they will democratize, and it will be wonderful. This is what Bill Clinton preaches to high heaven. There\u2019s also another element involving our political class \u2026 and we\u2019re all talking about this this week because of the Hunter Biden thing. \u2026 Hunter Biden got a sweetheart deal with the state-owned Bank of China for his private equity firm, a $1.4 billion injection of cash, at the same time that Vice President Joe Biden was negotiating U.S. policy with China.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this relationship that Hunter Biden had [with China], and the way his father responded, is that part of the problem, as well, that they are able to buy out our people?\u201d asked Mansour.\n\n\u201cYeah, what you run into is that it\u2019s not a quid pro quo, per se,\u201d replied Spalding, describing China\u2019s message to its business partners as, \u201cAdopt Xi Jinping\u2019s worldview, [which] is, \u2018I need you to remain open for business.'\u201d\n\nOpposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy towards China, particularly tariffs, is largely driven by financially compromised figures, said Spalding.\n\n\u201c[Donald Trump] comes in and says, \u2018Hey, I want to put in tariffs,\u2019 and then you have all of these folks on the right and on the left saying,\u2019Tariffs are bad,'\u201d Spalding said. \u201cIf you start to really dig down deep, where did they make their money? What are their economic and financial relations that they have, and how does that impact the way they think about the world? And what you\u2019ll find is, a lot of them, quite frankly, can tie the money that they made back to some kind of relationship with China, and so it\u2019s not that they\u2019re saying, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to betray my country for China,\u2019 it\u2019s that, \u2018My way of looking at the world has been very successful for me. It\u2019s enriched me. I\u2019ve gotten very rich, and I read this book that Thomas Friedman wrote [titled] The World Is Flat, and globalization is good, and not only is it good in a profit sense, when I was out there getting very wealthy earning these millions of dollars, I was also on a crusade to democratize the world because open markets lead to wealth and wealth leads to democracy, and while I get rich, the world gets freer.'\u201d\n\nSpalding concluded, \u201cBut in reality, the Chinese have essentially re-engineered that world after the Tiananmen Square massacre in order to ensure that while the elites got rich in the countries they were doing business with, power \u2014 geopolitical power \u2014 accrued to the Chinese Communist Party, because they had essentially gamed the system to do so.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.", "description": "China procures political compliance among American elites through development of financial relationships, explained Robert Spalding.", "authors": ["Robert Kraychik"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/wi/ap/30/d93b47_aptopix-china-70-years-04977-xi-jinping-chinese-president-xi-jinping-toast-e1570817853616-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
