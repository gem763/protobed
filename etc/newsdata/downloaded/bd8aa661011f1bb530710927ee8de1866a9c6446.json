At one point, however, protesters gathered at an intersection along the route to yell at nearby riot police, who eventually charged to disperse the crowd.\n\nLater, a few dozen protesters dressed in black with gas masks and helmets constructed a roadblock in a narrow street near a shopping center and the area\u2019s town hall. They threw bricks in the direction of police and dropped petrol bombs from elevated walkways. Police fired tear gas and advanced.\n\nA Hong Kong government spokesman said protesters vandalized light-rail stops and placed objects on the track, and that some people assaulted a police officer and tried to snatch his revolver. The protesters\u2019 actions \u201ccompletely disregard law and order,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nSaturday\u2019s events show that violent protests are becoming more recurrent and could pose a risk to the semiautonomous Hong Kong government during China\u2019s anniversary celebration. Hong Kong has already canceled fireworks planned for that day in response to the unrest.\n\nIn the evening, hundreds gathered at a different shopping center near a subway station to mark the two-month anniversary of an attack by a group of white-clad men, which left dozens of protesters and bystanders injured.\n\nPro-democracy protesters demonstrate in a shopping mall in the district of Yuen Long to mark the two-month anniversary of the triad attack that took place in the Yuen Long train station, in Hong Kong.

Many protesters believe police didn\u2019t do enough to protect people and haven\u2019t made finding the perpetrators of that attack a priority. Police have charged some in relation to the attacks in recent weeks.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam has pledged to withdraw the extradition bill, but the focus on police conduct is still fueling protesters\u2019 anger with the government. At the shopping center Saturday, one 33-year-old protester who gave her name as Stephanie said she wasn\u2019t involved in the protest movement until the July 21 attack, which shocked her because she works nearby.\n\n\u201cYou can see police around everywhere, really concerned about us causing trouble,\u201d she said, as protesters shouted slogans and sang songs in the mall, which included some luxury stores. \u201cBut where were they when we needed their help?\u201d\n\nPolice officials have expressed concerns about the increasing violence from protesters and are worried they may have to respond in more forceful ways. One police official said there were situations in the past when lethal force would have been justified but wasn\u2019t used, which is evidence of officers\u2019 restraint.\n\nSome protesters, however, blame the police for the escalating violence. Bess Chow, 24, who was watching other protesters build the roadblocks, said constructing the defensive structures was justified given police actions. She said the government needs to set up an independent inquiry into police conduct, which is one of the five demands of the protest movement. The other demands include the withdrawal of the extradition bill, amnesty for arrested protesters and electoral reforms to allow Hong Kongers to vote for their leaders.\n\nIf the government won\u2019t \u201cdo something to make the police pay the price, I think this protest won\u2019t stop,\u201d Ms. Chow said.\n\nOn Friday, Regina Ip, a member of Hong Kong\u2019s Executive Council, pushed back against the demand for an independent investigation into the police, suggesting that an inquiry from an already existing police oversight panel is sufficient.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should concede to demands if that\u2019s purely driven by hatred or wishful revenge,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should make sure that also the police have a fair hearing.\u201d\n\n\u2014Joyu Wang contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Mike Cherney at mike.cherney@wsj.com", "description": "Protesters threw petrol bombs and police fired tear gas and made several arrests during a march in Hong Kong, presenting a big challenge to the city\u2019s leaders ahead of China\u2019s upcoming 70th anniversary.", "authors": ["Mike Cherney", "Mike.Cherney Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109591/social", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
