No words - you really have no idea how isolated you are.\n\n'Issy is awake now and with more surgery this morning we know with time and help and rehab my precious little girl will be fine.'\n\nTroy Dicks, a flight nurse with the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS), told ABC Isabella was lucky she was not more seriously injured.\n\nShe sustained a 'nasty finger injury'.\n\nUluru will be closed off to climbers in October 26 after a decision was made to prevent future scaling of the sacred site\n\n'It was a compound fracture. So there was bone showing.\n\n'She was covered in grazes because she had rolled down Uluru quite a lot and [that] took a lot of skin off.\n\n'She also had an ankle injury. I'm not sure whether it was broken or not but it was certainly swollen and deformed.'\n\nThe incident comes just days before a ban to climb the rock comes into effect on October 26.\n\nThe Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park board decided unanimously they would forbid people from climbing the sacred rock in 2017.\n\nFears have been raised in the past few months over tourists flocking to climb the rock before the closure.", "description": "Isabella Schiller, 12, was climbing the sacred rock in\u00a0the Northern Territory with her parents and younger brother on Monday when she lost her footing.", "authors": ["Kelsey Wilkie For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/23/19762318-0-image-a-2_1571178471457.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
