Griffin is included in the carnage. Toward the end of the clip, CNN is shown attacking her with what appears to be an ax.\n\n\u201cIm depicted as being murdered by The President of the United States in this video,\u201d Griffin wrote on Twitter Sunday, though technically the president isn\u2019t the one who kills her in the video. \u201cThe left, right & center left me hanging out to dry regarding the Trump mask photo. Please don\u2019t let it happen again. No, this video isn\u2019t a joke to his followers. And it will not be taken as such.\u201d\n\nThe graphic video was played recently at a conference hosted by American Priority at the Trump National Doral Miami, The New York Times reported Sunday. Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign said it had nothing to do with the video and does not condone violence. American Priority said the clip was shown as part of a meme exhibit and was \u201cnot associated with or endorsed by the conference in any official capacity.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a tweet Monday morning that while Trump had not yet seen the video clip, he \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d it \u2014 even though the president has yet to address it directly himself on Twitter or otherwise.\n\nHuffPost, CNN, CBS, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and former President Barack Obama are among the victims of the imagined Trump rampage in the \u201cChurch of Fake News.\u201d\n\nCNN denounced the video in a statement on Sunday via Twitter: \u201cSadly, this is not the first time that supporters of the president have promoted violence against the media in a video they apparently find entertaining \u2014 but it is by far and away the worst.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated to include a tweet from White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham.", "description": "\"This video isn\u2019t a joke to his followers.
