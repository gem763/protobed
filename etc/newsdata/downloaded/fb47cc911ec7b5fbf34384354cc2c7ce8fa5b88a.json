There is so much on the line. Egos, subscribers, the crown of 'The YouTube King'.\n\n\"The last match was a draw. If the W is secured in a monumental way, something similar to when Conor McGregor knocked out Jose Aldo - if something like that happens, it is going to be long-lasting form of stardom.\"\n\nPaul, who has previously said he will move into MMA after fighting KSI, said he wants to be taken seriously as a fighter rather than branded a YouTuber.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAfter The Bell: Watch Mirror Fighting's new boxing show Mirror Fighting has launched a new weekly boxing show in association with Betfair in which we analyse the latest big fights, play matchmaker, and preview forthcoming bouts.

People look at you in a different way when you get inside these ropes and put it all on the line.\u201d", "description": "Paul hopes victory over KSI can propel him to stardom - just like 13-second knockout win did for McGregor", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Zuffa Llc Via Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20657013.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_KSI-Logan-Paul-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
