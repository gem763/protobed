In addition to giving us this ad campaign featuring a photogenic cat, Aiko filmed an ASMR video to introduce us to the product that gets you the natural-looking glow of someone like Aiko who drinks enough water, prioritizes sleep, puts effort into her skin care, and doesn\u2019t want to completely cover all that hard work up.\n\nThe Cut recently caught up with Aiko before True Portrait\u2019s launch to talk deep breaths, brows, and alkalized water.\n\nYou\u2019ve previously been very open about your skin-care routine on social media; can you give us a 2019 update? Are you still getting Fraxel? Trying anything new?\n\nI haven\u2019t done Fraxel in 2019. I\u2019ve been keeping it more natural, mixing up my own little concoctions. My skin is really sensitive and the treatments can get expensive; I think the last one I got was probably the beginning of last year. So now my routine is more about maintaining previous results. I really like neem oil and calendula oil. I had a rash a while ago and I just used chamomile and oatmeal in a bath. I soaked in it and put it on my face, my whole body. Ever since then, if anything happens, that\u2019s my go-to. It\u2019s inexpensive, you know? The weather, my stress levels, where I\u2019m at, the climate all affect my skin so I always have a bunch of stuff at hand so I can mix this with that and customize.\n\nWhat\u2019s your nighttime beauty routine like?\n\nI love a good bath, I love a good soak. I love sheet masks, I\u2019m always trying out different ones. I definitely wash my face, whether I have makeup on or not. There have been a few times when I\u2019m just so tired, I\u2019ll go to sleep. It makes such a difference when I don\u2019t wash my face. I will literally have a pimple the next day and be like F***! Getting enough sleep, too. Making sure I have enough time to get at least eight hours because my skin really responds to sleep. If I don\u2019t get enough sleep my skin will be like Why?!?!\n\nWhat time do you go to bed?\n\nI\u2019ve been recording for a while now and it really throws off my sleep. Sometimes I\u2019ll leave early and I can get to bed at 11 pm, which is kind of early for me. But lately, I\u2019ve been going to sleep at 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. The last couple of times I was in the studio I went to bed at 8 a.m. But luckily I don\u2019t have a 9 to 5, so I can work around whenever I get to sleep. I sleep like a growing boy; I sleep like I\u2019m 13 years old. But I get a lot of inspiration from my dreams, so I think I get deep in my dream world. It\u2019s my favorite thing to do: Sleep.\n\nDo you remember your dreams a lot?\n\nI do! I\u2019ve definitely written songs and stuff that was in my dreams before. In the short film that I put out with my last album, there\u2019s a part with me and my brother that was blow by blow something I dreamt about. As soon as I woke up, I wrote it down. I\u2019ve been trying to practice doing that more, as soon as I wake up to write it down, even if it\u2019s silly.\n\nA lot of people also cite water as their beauty secret. How do you like your water?\n\nI like room temperature, and at home, I have a Kangen water machine. It\u2019s a Japanese water machine that alkalizes your water, and it has different levels so, water for your hair, water to clean with, water to drink, water to make tea and coffee with. It\u2019s my favorite water, but I can\u2019t travel with it, so I always try to have water in glass bottles because I try not to do a lot of plastic.\n\nWhat eats up more of your time: caring for and doing your face, or caring for and doing your hair?\n\nOoh. My hair for sure. Sometimes I have good skin days and I\u2019m like Oh, just spray some rose water on it and go. But my hair \u2026 you seem like you have curly hair too, so you know how curls go. Some days it\u2019ll be good and some days you\u2019re like What? I did the same thing that I always do. That\u2019s why my hair\u2019s always different [laughs].\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite way to apply foundation? Are you more team hands, team brush or team sponge?\n\nWith this foundation, what I love about it is the feel of it. So I like to apply it with my fingertips. I like making it a real self-care moment with a little massage.\n\nWhat have you taught your daughter about beauty? What has she taught you, directly or indirectly, about beauty and how you view it?\n\nShe\u2019s definitely taught me to be more comfortable in my skin and to accept myself, just by looking at her and seeing how beautiful she is. I\u2019ll always think that no matter what. She\u2019s opened my eyes to see everyone\u2019s beauty, including my own.\n\nI want to lead by example and I\u2019ve been teaching her about taking care of her skin, drinking water, taking her vitamins and eating her vegetables, and washing her face in the morning, when she gets home from school, and before she goes to sleep. She\u2019ll be 11, so she\u2019s starting to go through her hormonal changes. I\u2019m always telling her, \u201cYou gotta wash your face if you don\u2019t want those bumps showing up, you gotta wash your hands!\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve also been telling her not to touch her hair. Don\u2019t dye it, and don\u2019t straighten it, because she has such beautiful, thick hair. I wish I never changed it. One time, I dyed my hair and it just totally changed my curl pattern. Oh, and don\u2019t touch your eyebrows! I clean up her eyebrows myself. She has such great ones.\n\nYour fans on YouTube finally got their wish: You filming an ASMR video. Was it hard to whisper for that long?\n\nIt was. I watch ASMR; my favorites are the soap-cutting ones and when they\u2019re eating the ice, but that\u2019s a wholly different type. The whispering ones are all about the little clicks and stuff, and I wasn\u2019t sure if I was whispering too loud the entire time. But I just did it my own way, and it was really fun; it was a dream come true.\n\nWhat\u2019s the last song that was stuck in your head?\n\nA song that I just did with Summer Walker \u2026 that\u2019s not out yet!\n\nWhat\u2019s on your phone\u2019s lock screen?\n\nIt\u2019s a little painting of a Buddha-like figure and it says, \u201cBreathe.\u201d And I just use it as a reminder to breathe \u2014 before I answer a call or anything. Thich Nhat Hanh, he\u2019s an author that I read a lot, that was one of his practices. The phone causes us so much anxiety. So with that as my background and lock screen, I\u2019m just [takes a deep breath]. It just keeps you in a good place.\n\nWhat\u2019s the last thing you binged watched?\n\nThis show called Love, Death & Robots on Netflix. And that was one of those nights I stayed up until 8 a.m. because it\u2019s so good.\n\nAnd last but not least, what\u2019s your favorite snack?\n\nOkay. I love Oreos. That\u2019s the best sweet snack. For my salty snack, I really just like chips and salsa, or guacamole. Or! An avocado with some salt and pepper on it.\n\nKat Von D Beauty True Portrait Foundation $36 at Sephora Buy\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "Jhene Aiko, singer, zen person and new face of Kat Von D Beauty\u2019s True Portrait foundation gives us a 2019 update on her skin-care routine, which no longer includes Fraxel.", "authors": ["Erica Smith"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/26/26-jhene-aiko.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
