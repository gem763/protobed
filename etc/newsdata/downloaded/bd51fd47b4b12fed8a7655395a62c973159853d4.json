Maria Smith, Starbucks\u2019 vice president of partnerships and payments, said:\n\n\u201cAs the flagship retailer, Starbucks will play a pivotal role in developing practical, trusted and regulated applications for consumers to convert their digital assets into US dollars for use at Starbucks.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s new in the app?\n\nBakkt\u2019s announcement broadly indicates a desire to speed up the conversion of digital assets into locally useful payment systems. It reads:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working to reduce friction in the use of digital assets to reflect their aggregate value and to reflect an increase in purchasing power that was previously siloed.\u201d\n\nThe mechanism that Bakkt will be using for exchanging digital assets at points-of-sale remains unclear. Smith mentioned 15 million Starbucks Rewards members as a template for payments, but operations involving competing retailers and depending on cryptocurrencies present different challenges.\n\nBakkt\u2019s futures and futures options trading\n\nBakkt has been busy in recent months. In September, the company opened trading of physically delivered Bitcoin futures on its platform.\n\nOn Oct. 24, following an all-time high in BTC futures contracts traded, Bakkt announced that it would be launching fully regulated BTC futures options trading in December.", "description": "Bakkt announced its coming app for consumer payments, with Starbucks on board as the flagship retailer starting next year", "authors": ["Kollen Post"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNTQ2ZWI4ZDYzODg4ZTFjZmJiMmNjNzViMDBjOTNmZjcuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
