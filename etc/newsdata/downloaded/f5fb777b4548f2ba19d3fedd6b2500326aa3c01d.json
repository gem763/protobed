The smell of smoke and the fear of encroaching flames kept pulling her back to that day two years ago when she woke up and realized her Coffey Park home in Santa Rosa was on fire. That night, she, her husband and their three children fled their new house with no shoes or jackets.\n\nThis weekend, amid overlapping crises of fire and blackouts, they have had to evacuate not once but twice.\n\nOn Saturday, they moved from a rental home in the town of Windsor into the house in Santa Rosa they are still rebuilding. Twelve hours later, at around 4 in the morning, they again fled amid rapidly expanding evacuation orders. \u201cIt\u2019s been like hell,\u201d Ms. Rivas, 37, said. \u201cWe had no water, no power, no anything.\u201d\n\nWorry gave way to panic across a huge swath of Northern California, as officials ordered more than 100,000 additional people to leave because of the Kincade fire, more than doubling those under mandatory evacuation to 180,000 people. The evacuations came as the state\u2019s largest utility cut power to as many as 2.7 million people , the largest power shut-off to prevent wildfires in California history.", "description": "Power outages and fires combined over the weekend to push the state\u2019s disaster response capabilities to the brink.", "authors": ["Lauren Hepler", "Jose A.
