Many said Tehran was well-positioned to exploit the departure of the Americans.\n\n\u201cI presume Iran was smiling ear to ear as Turkey rushed into Syria,\u201d said Sen. Mitt Romney, Utah Republican.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe that this changes the dynamic with Iran,\u201d Mr. Hook insisted.\n\nU.S.-allied Kurdish fighters have criticized the withdrawal as being a \u201cstab in the back\u201d and a \u201cbetrayal\u201d after the group had led the ground fight to defeat the Islamic State\u2019s Syria-based \u201ccaliphate.\u201d\n\nAlthough Iran has been a focus of Mr. Trump\u2019s Middle East policy and the U.S. pulled out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal in the spring of 2018, Wednesday\u2019s hearing marks the first public testimony on Iran from an administration official before the Senate panel since March 2017.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
