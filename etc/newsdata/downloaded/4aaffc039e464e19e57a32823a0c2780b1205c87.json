The company will shelve its plan for an initial public offering. (Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nCo-working company WeWork said Monday it will ask to withdraw its initial public offering filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, postponing its attempts to go public indefinitely.\n\nThe announcement is the latest in a string of bad news for the embattled We Co., following the departure of chief executive Adam Neumann last week after a Wall Street Journal report on his problematic behavior. WeWork earlier this year was valued as high as $47 billion, but in recent weeks the company considered an offering that would slash its value to as low as $10 billion, according to Reuters. The company had already delayed its IPO.\n\n[Embattled WeWork co-founder and CEO Adam Neumann will step down, company says]\n\nWeWork\u2019s core \u201cspace-as-a-service\u201d business involves turning leased buildings into co-working spaces that offer perks like yoga classes. Under the We Co. umbrella, the company has recently expanded into apartment rentals, data analytics and education.\n\nNeumann was replaced by two co-CEOs: Artie Minson, formerly the company\u2019s co-president and chief financial officer; and Sebastian Gunningham, who was vice chairman. In a statement, the CEOs said the offering was being postponed so the company could focus on its core business, which they insisted remains strong.\n\n[When everyone is a tech company, no one is]\n\n\u201cWe have every intention to operate WeWork as a public company and look forward to revisiting the public equity markets in the future,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe company declined to comment beyond its written statement.\n\nThe announcement comes a few days after S&P Global Ratings dropped WeWork\u2019s credit rating from a \u201cB\u201d to a \u201cB-\u201d and its outlook from \u201cstable\u201d to \u201cnegative\u201d over concerns about the company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital. Tatiana Kleiman, an S&P analyst who covers WeWork, said the IPO filing made public on Aug. 14 amplified existing scrutiny of the company\u2019s governance practices and strategy.\n\n\u201cIt seems that the company is evaluating a lot of things with respect to management composition and strategy,\u201d Kleiman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very fluid and dynamic situation right now.\"\n\nWeWork\u2019s stumble adds to a rough summer for what was supposed to be a potential record-setting year in tech IPOs. After disappointing debuts earlier this year, both ride-sharing giants Uber and Lyft shares have plummeted in value. Messaging company Slack initially traded higher before falling to about half its opening price. Fitness bike purveyor Peloton also came out of the gate last week with a disappointing start.\n\nThe wave of problems has triggered criticism among analysts and investors, some of whom say valuations among tech companies \u2014 and those that presented themselves as tech companies \u2014 were becoming bloated and possibly contributing to a bubble.\n\n[2019 shaping up as the year of the fad IPO]\n\nA recent Goldman Sachs report said only 26 percent of companies that completed an IPO in 2018 had positive net income in their first annual report, the lowest share since the first tech bubble burst around the turn of the millennium.\n\nWe Co.'s used the word \u201ctechnology\u201d more than 100 times in its IPO filling, and Chief Product Officer Shiva Rajaraman told TechCrunch in February that the company is \u201cmoving toward a Google Analytics for space.\u201d Monday\u2019s statement by Minson and Gunningham indicates WeWork may again return to its real estate roots.\n\nThe filing also stated that Neumann\u2019s departure \u201ccould have a material adverse effect on [the] business.\u201d The document contains the word \u201cAdam\u201d 169 times.\n\nNeumann\u2019s behavior within the company included walking around the office barefoot, creating an alcohol-focused company culture and saying he wanted to become \u201cpresident of the world,\u201d according to the Wall Street Journal report.\n\nIn a statement announcing his departure, Neumann said the scrutiny directed toward his leadership of the company had become \u201ca significant distraction.\"", "description": "The embattled co-working company has lost a CEO and seen its valuation tank over just a few weeks.", "authors": ["Marie C.
