There is no doubting the positives of the Brazilian\u2019s play; David Luiz can change games with his passing and prowess in the opposition box but his propensity for switching off is there for all to see. Unai Emery played three defensive midfielders at home against Tottenham, and one suspects he has limited faith in his defence, as proved by the counterattack for the opener, which saw David Luiz wander off and an unmarked Christian Eriksen tap into an empty net after a goalkeeping error. At least January is not too far away and Arsenal can plan once more to solve their problems, preferably not with a deadline-day signing.

It\u2019s often said and always wrong, and anyone in doubt of that should watch Fabinho\u2019s display in the victory against Burnley. The Brazilian was outstanding in a defensive midfield role, combining tactical maturity with natural athleticism. He completed 82.3% of his passes, won 66.7% of his tackles, made five recoveries and even found the time to earn a free\u2011kick. The 25\u2011year\u2011old has become a fundamental figure for the European champions and deserves to be recognised as one of the best players in his position right now.

C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta has gone off the boil in recent months and the right-back had another poor game in the 2-2 draw with Sheffield United. The 30-year-old\u2019s lack of confidence was evident when Enda Stevens zigzagged past him to tee up Callum Robinson just after half\u2011time, and he was unable to block the cross that led to Kurt Zouma\u2019s own goal handing United a point in the 89th minute. Those slips will surely not have escaped Lampard\u2019s attention and although Azpilicueta has mostly been a reliable performer since joining in 2012, he could benefit from a spell out of the side. The case grows every week for Reece James, another of Chelsea\u2019s aspiring academy products, to be given a chance when he has recovered from an ankle injury.

So it was perhaps indicative of what the manager had on his mind that he had volunteered a reminder to the press that the club\u2019s summer pursuit of forward reinforcements had been frustrated. Those issues would not be masked by the team\u2019s best start in four years. \u201cWe\u2019re not a bad football team, we looked dangerous and, although we didn\u2019t get the centre\u2011forward we were hoping to get in the transfer window, we still have good firepower up front,\u201d said Hodgson. \u201cAnd we still have our powder dry and maybe a player will come up in January.\u201d Harris and his compatriot David Blitzer are open to selling their stakes but, if that is has not been achieved by January, they will be clearly pressed to sanction further investment in this team.

This would have felt like two points dropped for Everton, despite their vast improvement on the corresponding fixture last season, without the Brazilian\u2019s decisive contribution. Less heralded but no less important in the victory was Fabian Delph, making his first appearance at Goodison Park since his summer transfer from Manchester City and showing precisely why Everton wanted his bite and maturity in central midfield with a commanding display. His value has increased to Silva in the absence of the injured Jean-Philippe Gbamin and he ensured R\u00faben Neves was unable to dictate Wolves\u2019s play as he would like. \u201cIt was a very good performance and Fabian is not in his best physical condition yet,\u201d said Silva. \u201cHe will improve even more. For Fabian and Alex [Iwobi] it is easier than some of the other new signings because they know the Premier League. Nothing is new for them only that they are now playing in our blue shirt.\u201d Andy Hunter\n\n\u2022 Match report: Everton 3-2 Wolves\n\n6) Howe\u2019s Bournemouth too open for comfort\n\nGiven the praise lavished on Harry Wilson in recent weeks, it is only fair to observe that he did nothing at Leicester on Saturday. That can happen with young players. More concerning was that Bournemouth suffered from an old problem. The team who conceded as many away goals last season as relegated Fulham and Huddersfield left themselves daftly open at the King Power Stadium. Partly that could be attributed to absences enforced by injury. But it was also down to an approach that played into Leicester\u2019s hands. Eddie Howe\u2019s attacking instincts are great but he needs to find a better balance when his teams go on the road, especially against sides who thrive on counterattacking. He also needs better defenders. Whatever happened to that Tyrone Mings guy that Bournemouth had but seldom used? Oh.

Although John Stones should return soon it will still leave the champions with two senior centre-backs, the loss of Laporte and the departure of Vincent Kompany cutting a swathe from their resources. Fernandinho can fill in and Guardiola suggested Kyle Walker might too but there is a risk they may regret not replacing Kompany \u2013 something Guardiola claimed they could not do. \u201cSometimes we cannot afford it like other teams,\u201d he said. \u201cThe club tell me: \u2018You have a limit, you cannot go forward, maybe in the future but not now\u2019 \u2026 so we are going with what we have.\u201d He made a point of mentioning City\u2019s academy and name-checked two teenage defenders, Eric Garcia and Taylor Harwood-Bellis. Perhaps that was more of a message to City\u2019s powers that be before January; it would be a stretch for them to complete a season looking this thin.

This was the lowest league attendance for a top-tier game at St James\u2019 Park since December 2012. It was no surprise to Joe Halliday, a spokesman for the pressure group \u201cEmpty for Ashley\u201d, which encourages fans to boycott games in a bid to force Newcastle\u2019s unloved owner to sell up. \u201cWe\u2019re becoming a zombie club,\u201d Halliday said. \u201cThousands of fans didn\u2019t renew their season tickets and are unwilling to continue filling Mike Ashley\u2019s pockets. The lack of ambition shown by the current ownership is leading to fans turning their backs on a club they once loved \u2013 it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d If an underwhelming draw did not help Steve Bruce to confound his critics, Watford\u2019s first point of the season almost certainly saved Javi Gracia\u2019s job \u2013 at least for .

Danny Ings and Che Adams may have contributed only a single goal between them in five matches but were unrelenting in their work-rate without having anything to show for it at St Mary\u2019s. \u201cI would have more problems with them if they did not even have a chance to score,\u201d Hasenh\u00fcttl said. \u201cThey had chances so I am confident. Don\u2019t forget they work so hard against the ball.\u201d Coupled with Sofiane Boufal \u2013 who has shown glimpses of talent since being reintegrated into the first team \u2013 Moussa Djenepo, Nathan Redmond and Shane Long, there are no shortage of options in Saints\u2019 forward ranks. Ben Fisher\n\n\u2022 Match report: Southampton 1-1 Manchester United\n\n10) West Ham attack has huge potential\n\nIt was only one game and Norwich were particularly obliging opponents, but West Ham gave a glimpse of exciting possibilities. Their front four started together for the second time and recorded a second win in the process. S\u00e9bastien Haller, Andriy Yarmolenko, Manuel Lanzini and pick of the bunch, Felipe Anderson, all bring different skills to the table and each blended harmoniously against the Canaries. Anderson\u2019s runs with the ball, Yarmalenko\u2019s runs without, Lanzini\u2019s passing and Haller\u2019s hold-up play all made a difference. More than that, they worked hard and to Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s tactical plan. Constantly interchanging possessions, they befuddled Norwich\u2019s defence. They doubled up on the flanks, not only nullifying the Canaries\u2019 expansive full-backs but robbing them of the ball. The quartet showed an understanding that belied the short time they have been together and, as Pellegrini suggested, delivered the kind of display he hopes his side can deliver on a regular basis this season.
