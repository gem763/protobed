The Pentagon's job was to look at different options, he added.\n\n\"We presently have troops in a couple of cities that (are)located right near that area,\" Esper said. \"The purpose is to deny access, specifically revenue to ISIS (Islamic State) and any other groups that may want to seek that revenue to enable their own malign activities.\"\n\nTrump's shift has opened a new chapter in Syria's more than eight-year war and prompted a rush by Turkey and by the Damascus government and its ally Russia to fill the vacuum left by the Americans.\n\nTrump's decision has been criticised in Washington and elsewhere as a betrayal of Kurdish allies who had fought for years alongside U.S. troops in a region rich in oil reserves and farmland.\n\nThe New York Times reported late on Sunday that Trump was now leaning in favour of a new military plan to keep about 200 U.S. troops in eastern Syria near the Iraq border. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"NECESSARY STEPS\"\n\nTurkey is seeking to set up a \"safe zone\" as a buffer against the YPG militia, the main component of the SDF. Ankara sees the YPG as a terrorist group due to its links to Kurdish insurgents in southeast Turkey.\n\nErdogan has said Ankara will resume its assault in Syria when the deadline expires on Tuesday if the SDF has not pulled back from its proposed zone, which spans much of the border.\n\n\"We will take up this process with Mr Putin and after that we will take the necessary steps\" in northeastern Syria, Erdogan told a forum in Istanbul hosted by broadcaster TRT World on Monday, without elaborating.\n\nErdogan has also said Turkey will set up a dozen observation posts in the \"safe zone\", prompting criticism from Iran.\n\n\"We are against Ankara's establishing of military posts in Syria,\" Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told a weekly news conference on Monday broadcast live on state TV.\n\n\"The issues should be resolved by diplomatic means ... Syria's integrity should be respected,\" said Mousavi, whose country is a staunch ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nEchoing such concerns, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said Russia believed long-term regional security could only be achieved by restoring Syrian unity and also by taking into account the interests of all the country's ethnic and religious groups.\n\nHe reiterated that Putin and Erdogan would discuss Turkey's military offensive in their talks on Tuesday in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi.\n\nRussian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu was quoted as saying that 12 Syrian prisons holding foreign militants as well as eight refugee camps had been left unguarded as a result of Turkey's military operation.\n\nTurkey's nearly two-week old offensive has displaced some 300,000 people and led to 120 casualties among civilians and 470 among SDF fighters, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Sunday. Turkey says 765 terrorists but no civilians have been killed in its offensive.", "description": "DOHUK, Iraq/KABUL, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The Pentagon is considering keeping some U.S. troops near oilfields in northeastern Syria alongside Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to help deny oil to Islamic State militants, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Monday.
