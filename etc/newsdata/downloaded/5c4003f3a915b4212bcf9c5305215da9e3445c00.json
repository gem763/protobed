Tristan Borges put the Hammers on the board first in the 21st minute, as Kyle Bekker found him with a sublime through ball from deep in midfield. Finishing coolly with a shot to the far post, Borges banked his eighth goal of the year to make it 1-0.\n\nAlthough their scoring opportunities were abundant in the first half, it wasn't until after the break that Forge found the net again. Chris Nanco swung a cross into the box and Jonathan Grant centered it with a header. Marcel Zajac, unmarked in the six-yard box, smashed it into the net with a header of his own for his first of the season.\n\nWATCH | Forge move to the top of the table:\n\nForge FC beats York9 FC 2-1, has a 1-point advantage over 2nd place Cavalry FC. 1:00\n\nYork9 boss Jimmy Brennan attempted to spark his side's attack with substitutions early in the second half, as his side woke up in search of a goal. They found one in the 65th minute, as Wataru Murofushi won his team a penalty. He put the spot kick away with a clean finish, as he sent Forge keeper Triston Henry diving the wrong way. The visitors then threw all they had at their opponents, spending plenty of time in the attacking third as their remaining time ticked away.\n\nThe comeback attempt ultimately fell short for York9, though, as Forge held them off for a well-deserved triumph. It was a frustrating afternoon for the Nine Stripes, who couldn't quite solve their rival's backline.", "description": "The 905 Derby belongs to Forge FC again, as they saw off local rivals York9 FC on Sunday with a 2-1 win at Tim Hortons Field.
