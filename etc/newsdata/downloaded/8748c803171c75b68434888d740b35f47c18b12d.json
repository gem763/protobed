They also have ignited conversations around revenge porn, biphobia (Hill is one of the first openly bisexual women in Congress) and what constitutes domestic violence in the digital age.\n\nThis is heartbreaking and a reminder that women in elected office are held to entirely different standards than their male colleagues. The horror of revenge porn and the cruelty of biphobia will not get nearly as much discussion as they deserve. https://t.co/6tYPYHEkwE \u2014 Charlotte Clymer\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@cmclymer) October 27, 2019\n\nThat the same people deeming Joe Biden canceled for hugging people too much are out defending Katie Hill having relationships with two of her subordinates more than a decade her junior exemplifies the double standard of gender the #MeToo movement still must overcome. \u2014 Tiana Lowe (@TianaTheFirst) October 28, 2019\n\nHill, who is in the midst of a messy divorce, has denied an accusation she had an affair with a male congressional staffer \u2013 the more serious charge, since it violates new House rules passed in the wake of #MeToo. She has admitted and apologized for having a relationship with a young female member of her campaign staff. Sexually explicit photos of her with the campaign staffer were published on the conservative website RedState. Hill has accused her estranged husband, who allegedly also participated in the affair, of being behind the photo release.\n\nAnalysis: It's been two years since the #MeToo movement exploded. Now what?\n\nWhether Hill should be investigated isn't up for debate. Sexual violence awareness advocates say that's wholly appropriate and a necessary part of changing a culture of sexual harassment and violence on Capitol Hill.\n\nBut the fact that the allegations have already led to her resignation, 10 days after the photos appeared online, is evidence Hill is being held to a different standard than her male counterparts, advocates say.\n\nHill will resign from Congress after an investigation by the House Ethics Committee was opened into allegations of the congresswoman's sexual relationships with her staff. More\n\n\"Katie Hill is a representative who is under investigation for an allegation for inappropriate sexual behavior, and that is something that should be happening to more lawmakers. That's an intended consequence of #MeToo,\" said Laura Palumbo, communications director at the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. \"It's important to note the consequences she faces may be different because she is a woman who also identifies as bi.\"\n\nLook at Rep. Duncan D. Hunter, R-Calif. Hunter was accused by federal prosecutors in June of using taxpayer money to carry on extramarital affairs with three lobbyists, a congressional aide and one of his staffers. Despite pressure to resign, he has remained in Congress and is expected to face a criminal trial in January.\n\nHill's defenders say it wasn't the alleged affairs that brought her down. It was revenge porn, defined by the nonprofit Without My Consent as \"non-consensual publication of explicit images as a way to emotionally abuse, sexually exploit and rob people of control over their own bodies.\"\n\nA House investigation may find Hill violated ethics rules, but sexual violence experts say Hill is also a victim. The public may understand this as a \"sex scandal,\" but in most states, revenge porn is a crime.", "description": "Katie Hill resigned after allegations of inappropriate relationships with staffers.
