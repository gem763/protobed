Mirae prevailed in a process that began early this year and attracted widespread interest from private-equity and government-run funds, these people said.\n\nThe two sides were on the verge of a deal last month, but a more formal agreement was held up when Anbang discovered the fraudulent deed transactions while performing a routine title search, according to people familiar with the matter. The search indicated that ownership of at least four California hotels had been transferred to limited liability companies.\n\nOne deed showed a transfer of ownership for Anbang\u2019s Montage Laguna Beach hotel, a luxury coastal resort in Southern California, to a company known as Andy Bang LLC, according to California property records.\n\nThe seller on the deed was listed only as Shr Holding Group LLC, records show.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s Westin St. Francis, the Loews Santa Monica and the Four Seasons Silicon Valley in East Palo Alto were also transferred to limited liability companies, though no sales prices were recorded, according to property records.\n\nDeeds for the Ritz-Carlton hotels in Half Moon Bay and in Laguna Niguel were also faked, said people familiar with the matter. These fraudulent transfers occurred without Anbang\u2019s knowledge or approval, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nRepresentatives for Anbang and Mirae declined to comment.\n\nThe Journal couldn\u2019t confirm the identity of the individual or how this person expected to profit from the illegal ownership transfers.\n\nFraudulent deed transfers, in which homes may be transferred without the knowledge of the seller, by forging signatures, for example, are common. In 2012, California\u2019s Department of Real Estate issued a consumer alert on the practice. These transfers are less common for larger commercial properties such as hotels.\n\nA December report by a Manhattan Supreme Court grand jury found an \u201cepidemic\u201d of fraudulent property transfers in New York City and noted that the Office of the Sheriff had received 2,000 complaints since 2014 and had 20 convictions since 2015.\n\nThe Anbang hotel portfolio includes high-end properties such as the Essex House overlooking Manhattan\u2019s Central Park and the InterContinental hotels in Chicago and Miami.\n\nShare Your Thoughts How much will Anbang\u2019s and other Chinese owners\u2019 real estate sales weigh on the U.S. property market? Join the conversation below.\n\nChinese insurers and other investors went on a U.S. real estate buying spree, taking advantage of new rules that allowed them to invest more easily abroad. Chinese companies, such as HNA Group and Greenland, scooped up trophy assets in big U.S. cities.\n\nIn 2015, Anbang paid $1.95 billion for New York\u2019s landmark Waldorf Astoria, the highest price ever for a U.S. hotel. The property is closed as it undergoes renovation. Anbang didn\u2019t include the hotel in the deal.\n\nIn recent years, the Chinese government has limited certain types of investments abroad, including real estate, as part of an effort to stabilize its currency.\n\nWrite to Craig Karmin at craig.karmin@wsj.com and Konrad Putzier at konrad.putzier@wsj.com", "description": "China\u2019s Anbang agreed to sell luxury hotels for more than $5.8 billion even as a California individual had secretly created a series of fake deeds to transfer ownership for up to a half-dozen of the properties.", "authors": ["Craig Karmin", "Konrad Putzier", "Craig.Karmin Wsj.Com", "Konrad.Putzier Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105876/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
