Company officials expect existing HBO customers, whether via cable or HBO Now, to switch to HBO Max, which will offer far more to watch.\n\nThe service will offer movies and programs from HBO and the Time Warner library, which AT&T obtained when it acquired the media giant for $81 billion. That will include \"Friends,\" which AT&T will pull back from Netflix. Other hits like \"The Big Bang Theory\" and \"South Park\" will also be available.\n\nHBO Max will challenge Netflix alongside Disney, Comcast and Apple.", "description": "AT&T says its HBO Max streaming service will launch in May for $15 a month, joining a crowded field of would-be rivals to Netflix.That's the same price as...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/08/wire-20364984-1572424714-25_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
