Nixon scored a TD on a 96-yard flea flicker. (Photo by Russell Lansford/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\nA flea flicker when you\u2019re backed up near your own goal line? Why not.\n\nWith the ball at its own 4 early in the fourth quarter against Nebraska on Saturday, Colorado tried a flea flicker. And crazily enough, it worked for a touchdown as Steven Montez found K.D. Nixon in single coverage.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nGAME. CHANGER.\n\n\n\nJust want the doctor ordered.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa FOX pic.twitter.com/pUA6XQ2Bl5 \u2014 Pac-12 Network (@Pac12Network) September 7, 2019\n\nYou can bet Nebraska wasn\u2019t expecting a flea flicker from there. Nor was it expecting Colorado to storm back like it did. The Cornhuskers led the game at halftime 17-0. And somehow ended up losing 34-31 in overtime to the Buffaloes.\n\nThe comeback looked like it was over after it began following the flea flicker, which cut Nebraska\u2019s lead to 17-14. Not long after Nixon scored, Nebraska\u2019s Adrian Martinez found Maurice Washington \u2014 still facing a felony child pornography charge \u2014 for a 75-yard touchdown to push Nebraska\u2019s lead back to 24-14.\n\nBut Colorado wasn\u2019t done. The Buffs tied the game at 24-24 after Martinez fumbled. Nebraska took a 31-24 lead on a Martinez TD with fewer than six minutes left, but Colorado tied the game again.\n\nMartinez\u2019s third turnover of the game then led to overtime. He threw an interception on a long heave downfield with 19 seconds left as Nebraska was trying to get in position for a game-winning field goal.\n\nColorado opened overtime with a 34-yard field goal by James Stefanou. After Martinez took a sack on third down when Nebraska had the ball, a 48-yard attempt by Isaac Armstrong sailed way right and Colorado had a second-straight win over Nebraska.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe game was Nebraska\u2019s first trip to Boulder since 2009 when the two teams were in the Big 12. In the ten years since, Colorado has left for the Pac-12 and the Huskers for the Big Ten as the Big 12 has only added West Virginia and TCU to replace the Buffs, Huskers, Texas A&M and Missouri.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Buffs won 34-31 in OT after trailing 17-0 at halftime.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Y1Trlc0cUtJosM0zoJHmJw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04OTY-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hndR_Wn876l5WF8rsVkzOw--~B/aD0yMTAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/52169080-d1bf-11e9-bde3-adb23fdd24d4", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
