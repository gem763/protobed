Such romantic encounters, as I pictured them, involved two people \u2014 one of whom always wore a black cocktail dress \u2014 joining each other for a candlelit dinner while, for reasons I never bothered to investigate, both wearing blindfolds.\n\nAs I wade blindly through the crowded Midtown venue where an audience has gathered to watch me go on a date with an actual blindfold strapped across my eyes, I think about the one-night bed-standers of Crosley\u2019s childhood imagination and the blindfolded daters of my own.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable the logic we\u2019ll build around a misapprehension,\u201d writes Crosley of the detailed illustration with which she once filled the gaps in her understanding of adult romance and sexuality.\n\nAs I blindly navigate my way in high heels, a production assistant guides me to my seat onstage and hands me a microphone, leaving my blindfold firmly in place. As I take my seat across the table from my date, a man blinded by similar means, it occurs to me that the realities we\u2019ll build around such misapprehensions may be even more remarkable than the logic.\n\nBlind dating gets a modern UpDate\n\nIt\u2019s a Friday night in the Fishbowl at the Dream Midtown, and the reality that so bizarrely mirrors my childhood misconception of a blind date has a name. It\u2019s called UpDating.\n\nThe brainchild of comedian Brandon Berman and former Facebook employee Harrison Forman, UpDating puts real New Yorkers on blind dates in front of live audiences in what the show\u2019s website calls \u201ca charming, high-octane adventure into the world of dating.\u201d Combining the fast pace and sudden intimacy of dating in the digital age into a spectacle that straddles the line between reality and performance, UpDating exists somewhere at the intersection of live comedy, reality TV and authentic, real-life interaction.\n\nBlind dating gets literal. (Photo courtesy of UpDating)\n\nIn other words, as Berman tells InsideHook, \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of a lot of things, this show.\u201d\n\nWhat started with Forman broadcasting his own dates on Facebook Live three years ago in San Francisco, UpDating has existed in its current format for just over a year, in which time Berman and Forman have hosted more than 30 blind dates in front of live audiences in sold-out venues throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn.\n\nWhat those audiences see is an approximately 90-minute show, hosted by Berman and starring two New Yorkers on a real, unscripted, unfiltered blind date \u2014 although the blindfolds do eventually come off.\n\nAs Forman and Berman will tell you, no two shows are alike. \u201cSome shows are raunchy, other shows are more romantic, and then other shows are really deep and religious and spiritual,\u201d says Forman. In the 30+ iterations of UpDating that have played out across New York, Forman and Berman have seen everything from mothers and daughters questioning each other\u2019s suitors to impromptu audience-delivered monologues on Mormonism and religious freedom. The one common thread that unites each unpredictable show to the next? Honesty.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything more authentic and unfiltered and honest than UpDating,\u201d Forman tells InsideHook.\n\n\u201cThat was our vision for the show,\u201d adds Berman. \u201cThe underlying theme was just pure vulnerability \u2014 not only with two people, but with a whole room experiencing that with you.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s those shared experiences that I think make our content really special.\n\nFor Berman and Forman, that real-life experience of group vulnerability combined with the growing culture of emotional oversharing that\u2019s blossomed on social media in recent years manifests among UpDating audiences as something comparable to a kind of group therapy.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very good for mental health, our show,\u201d says Berman. \u201cI really do.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because, for all the inevitable comparisons to The Bachelor UpDating tends to attract, Forman and Berman aren\u2019t just trying to play matchmaker or stir up drama for an audience. More than romance or entertainment, UpDating has, perhaps ironically, always been about providing space for authentic connections of all kinds.\n\nForman and Berman have seen some dates go well and many go poorly, but regardless of the outcome between the prospective couple onstage, UpDating always seems to find a way of accomplishing its founding goal of bringing people together. During the second half of the show, audience members have a chance to shoot their shot with either of the daters on stage, turning the show into an interactive experience for cast and audience alike. \u201cIt should have an impact on the people on the date because they\u2019re really opening themselves up,\u201d says Forman, \u201cand it should also have an impact on people in the audience who are watching other people go through this.\u201d\n\nBerman (left) and Forman (right) have hosted more than 30 dates throughout New York. (Photo courtesy of UpDating)\n\nBy and large, the show continues to surpass that goal, often generating some of the most moving reactions from male audience members. \u201cA lot of them have said to me, \u2018Because of this show and seeing this, I was able to be more vulnerable on dates and be a little more honest,\u2019\u201d Berman tells InsideHook. \u201cPeople may not always meet at the show,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut 99 percent of people leave this and do take something from that show and approach dating differently.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s those shared experiences that I think make our content really special,\u201d adds Forman.\n\nThe Ghost of Dating Yet to Come\n\nIf UpDating is, as CNBC has claimed, \u201cthe future of dating,\u201d it\u2019s also the past.\n\n\n\nBoth Berman and Forman wax nostalgic for a bygone era of New York City romance, painting an image of dating culture pulled straight out of Sex and the City \u2014 a shared influence both will cop to unapologetically.\n\nOther \u201990s and early-aughts icons pepper UpDating\u2019s backstory as well. Berman cites Howard Stern as his chief comedic inspiration \u2014 \u201cI say it literally every day,\u201d he tells me, after mentioning Stern for the fourth time in three phone calls \u2014 and the duo shares a love of the 2004 teen flick The Girl Next Door.\n\nIn many ways, UpDating is a return to these older models of dating and romance, remnants of what Forman calls \u201cthe Sex and the City-era, where you don\u2019t really see phones anywhere.\u201d\n\nBerman hosts each live date. (Photo courtesy of UpDating)\n\nHowever, as a Facebook alum with a self-described background at the intersection of tech and media, Forman has no intention of trying to thwart technology altogether. Rather than a delusional attempt to recreate an idealized vision of dating pre-internet, Forman and Berman have found a way to expertly blend the tools of the digital age with the romantic nostalgia of decades past.\n\n\u201cIt would be a little na\u00efve if we didn\u2019t utilize technology at all,\u201d says Forman. \u201cIt would be really ignorant of us if we just said, \u2018get away from all digital.\u2019 That\u2019s just not going to happen. So we had to figure out a way to create our show that is modern with some of these tools, but also goes back to what I personally love, which is the romance of the \u201980s and \u201990s and early 2000s.\u201d\n\nRight now, much of UpDating\u2019s engagement with the digital age takes place on Instagram. Audience members use the app to DM questions and comments for the daters throughout the show, turning a digital platform often accused of contributing to a growing culture of social disengagement into a vessel for real-life, in-person interaction.\n\nWe can bring people together that would normally never swipe right.\n\nUpDating has a slightly more complicated relationship with other apps, namely certain swipe-based ones that are largely responsible for redefining the modern dating landscape as we know it today. While the show is often positioned as a haven for weary app-daters craving a reprieve from endless swiping, its creators don\u2019t necessarily see it as strictly in opposition with dating apps, but rather as an alternative that is in some ways a product of dating-app culture.\n\n\u201cOur official UpDating position is not, \u2018Get off dating apps,\u2019\u201d says Forman, who says the show instead hopes to foster a culture of \u201crenewed confidence\u201d among today\u2019s singles. \u201cDating apps shouldn\u2019t be your only option, your only route,\u201d he says. \u201cYou should be able to be confident to go out there in real life and meet people in bars, venues, maybe on a stage in front of a live audience.\u201d\n\nUnlike dating apps like Hinge, the self-branded app \u201cdesigned to be deleted\u201d that\u2019s currently plastering the subway with ads promising to deliver your soulmate, UpDating isn\u2019t strictly in the business of happily ever after. While the show has its romantic \u201csuccess stories,\u201d UpDating is first and foremost about facilitating connections, especially ones that probably wouldn\u2019t have occurred otherwise.\n\n\u201cWe can bring people together that would normally never swipe right,\u201d says Berman. \u201cI want to take people from different walks of life and watch and see what it\u2019s like for them to date.\u201d\n\n\u201cBerman and I have never said we\u2019re these ultimate matchmakers,\u201d adds Forman. \u201cWe\u2019re figuring it out just like everyone else.\u201d\n\nReal-world influencers\n\nAnother testament to UpDating\u2019s unique ability to simultaneously embrace and subvert the usually all-encompassing influence of the digital age is the show\u2019s remarkable success in the absence of a comparably dominant social media presence.\n\nUpDating is different from just about every other successful young brand today in that the majority of its power doesn\u2019t come from likes and followers. While the show has the obligatory Twitter and Instagram accounts, their relatively small following (just under 2,000 Instagram followers at time of writing) scarcely reflects the volume of influence the show maintains among its real-life followers \u2014 aka the 100+ audience members who regularly pack UpDating\u2019s sold-out shows, leaving as many as 50 more people outside hoping to get in.\n\n\u201cWe do have a waitlist every week,\u201d says Berman. \u201cIt\u2019s a good problem.\u201d\n\nWhile those who judge UpDating by its relatively low social-media following may be surprised to see the vast interest the show regularly attracts in real life, UpDating\u2019s lack of social media promotion is largely by design.\n\nUpDating has hosted shows throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn. (Photo courtesy of UpDating)\n\n\u201cYes, we could buy followers and have a lot more,\u201d says Forman. \u201cBut we\u2019re more old school. Let\u2019s get people in a room and get them connecting that way. That\u2019s been our focus from day one.\u201d\n\nIn other words, UpDating is thriving not just despite its quiet social presence, but largely because of it.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t really spent a dime on marketing. It\u2019s all been word of mouth and organic,\u201d says Forman. \u201cWe\u2019re relying on creating really good content, really good experiences.\u201d\n\nWhile the show itself is less than two hours out of their week, Berman and Forman \u201clive the brand on a daily basis,\u201d promoting the show at bars throughout the city, crashing real first dates, and getting to know prospective UpDaters through a lengthy casting process that feels more like a heart-to-heart phone call with an old friend.\n\n\u201cYes, we have Instagram accounts, but we\u2019re not focused on that,\u201d says Forman. \u201cWe live in the real world. That\u2019s who we are.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, UpDating is a product of its time. In at least as many, it is also timeless. It\u2019s at once a throwback to a bygone era of dating and a testament to the current one. Lifting and subverting aspects of one or the other, it\u2019s carved out its own frontier in the modern dating landscape.", "description": "Brandon Berman and Harrison Forman's live UpDating events are a throwback to an older era that is also very much a product of its time.", "authors": ["Kayla Kibbe"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/UpDating-Is-Putting-Real-Dates-On-Stage.png?fit=1200%2C800", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
