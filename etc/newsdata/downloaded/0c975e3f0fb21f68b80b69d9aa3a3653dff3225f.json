Two other children were in critical condition.\n\n\"We were in class reading and we heard pupils and teachers screaming, and the class started collapsing and then a stone hit me on the mouth,\" one survivor, 10-year-old Tracy Oduor, told The Associated Press. \"When we got out of the gate we heard that pupils were dead. I feel so sad!\"\n\nParents wailed over the remains of The Precious Talent Top School in Nairobi, and hundreds of people gathered as emergency workers picked through debris.\n\nGovernment spokesman Cyrus Oguna confirmed the deaths, and Kenyatta National Hospital later said 64 children had been admitted, most with minor injuries.\n\n\"The children here were all running away and crying,\" resident Michael Otieno said. More than 800 students are enrolled at the school, officials said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why the building of corrugated metal and wood collapsed around 7:30 a.m. Construction can be poorly regulated in some fast-growing Kenyan communities.\n\n\"You can easily break it with your own hands, as easy as that,\" Peter Ouko, a resident, said of the building materials. \"This is chicken wire, not a construction material, and someone had the guts to use this to build a construction for our kids. I think this is basically premeditated murder.\"\n\nNathaniel Matalanga, a structural engineer with La Femme Engineering Services Ltd., told reporters that he didn't think \"any professionals\" were involved in the school's construction and he blamed \"greed.\"\n\nThere was no immediate comment from school officials.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP\u2014Africa", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
