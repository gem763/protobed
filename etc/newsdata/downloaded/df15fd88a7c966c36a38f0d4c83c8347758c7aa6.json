Kids burn out and even professional ballerinas are often done by 30.\n\nBut I have since learned there is one remarkable exception, which is why I came to Dallas, Texas, to meet the woman Meryl wants to become.\n\nSuzelle Poole is every ballerina's exemplar, more than seven decades in dance and still on her toes. Most ballerinas can't begin to imagine this. Certainly, Suzelle never did.\n\n\"When I was about 26, I knew I only had a few years left,\" she said.\n\nNow, she's 79, but she said she doesn't find dancing difficult. \"Some people think that I dance better than ever \u2014 but some people haven't seen me.\"\n\nBorn in London, Suzelle started dancing at the age of 7 and eventually performed around the world. Today, she still does guest appearances with local dance companies, with no plans for a final farewell.\n\nSuzelle Poole with Meryl CBS News\n\nEven when she broke her arm a few years ago, Suzelle was back at the barre within a week.
