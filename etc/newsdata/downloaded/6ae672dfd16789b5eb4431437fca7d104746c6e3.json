The sitters are feminine, sensual, proffering ripe fruits and wearing flower garlands. The colours are bright: tropical yellows, hot pinks, mango orange and cobalt blue.\n\nThis description applies to some of the paintings in a new exhibition, Gauguin\u2019s Portraits, at the National Gallery. It is, astonishingly, the first major show to focus on Paul Gauguin\u2019s portraiture \u2013 strikingly odd as it often is, filled with symbolism, narrative, strange juxtapositions, and frankly, unflattering angles.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- William Blake: The greatest visionary in 200 years\n\n- The artist in search of the \u2018essence of life\u2019\n\n- F\u00e9lix Vallotton: A painter of disquiet and menace\n\nBut that description also applies to a series of photographs by Swiss-Guinean photographer Namsa Leuba, part of the inaugural exhibition at Boogie Wall, a new London gallery dedicated to female artists. Entitled Illusions \u2013 The Myth of the Vahine Through Gender Dysphoria, Leuba\u2019s series of photographic portraits adopt the colour palette of Gauguin\u2019s most famous works, but subvert the stereotyped imagery of exoticised, eroticised Polynesian women (vahine) by using transgender sitters.\n\n\u201cGauguin\u2019s depictions of Tahiti have very much become the default visual legacy of Tahiti in an art-historical sense, which has emphasised the sense of \u2018otherness\u2019,\u201d says Leuba, who divides her time between Europe and French Polynesia. \u201cIn Gauguin\u2019s colonial depictions, Polynesian women were beautiful and subservient.\u201d She wants her work to form an \u201cideological challenge to the visual codes initiated by Gauguin and his search for the \u2018primitive\u2019\u201d.\n\nGauguin has been accused of looting other cultures\u2019 traditions for \u2018exotic\u2019 imagery\n\nGauguin\u2019s portraits from Tahiti, and later the Marquesas Islands in the South Pacific, have certainly long attracted controversy: while there is something heady, lush and swimmily off-kilter in his colour and compositions, the works also embody a crude colonial attitude. The French artist (1848-1903) first went to Tahiti in 1891, abandoning his family, and having sexual relationships with girls he claimed were as young as 13, giving many of them syphilis.\n\nCo-curator at the National Gallery, Christopher Riopelle, says that \u201cGauguin radically expanded the parameters of portraiture\u201d, in part through this mixing of aspects of traditional Western portrait-painting with apparent celebrations of indigenous Polynesian culture. But he has also been accused of merely looting other cultures\u2019 traditions for \u2018exotic\u2019 imagery to make his paintings of a fantasy version of Tahiti more floggable to wealthy Parisians. Gauguin played fast and loose with his Primitivist, mystical imagery: the hieroglyphs in the background of The Ancestors of Tehamana are nonsensical, for instance, while various deities in his paintings were copied from photographs of statues of Indonesian and Indian gods.\n\nSeparating the art from the artist\n\nAnd can we \u2013 should we \u2013 be willing to overlook the predatory sexual behaviour of an artist, when considering their paintings of young women? It is not a good look in 2019, frankly. Art critic Alistair Sooke has used the show as an opportunity to dub Gauguin a \u201c19th-Century Harvey Weinstein\u201d (although he still gave it five stars). But there is perhaps no winning for the gallery here: The Guardian\u2019s critic accused the curators of cowardice, for actually showing very few of Gauguin\u2019s more overtly sexual nudes \u2013 and thereby swerving the discomfort, and the debate. Most of his pictures that depict young Polynesian girls in the exhibition are ones where they\u2019re covered up by the brightly coloured, high-necked dresses introduced by Christian missionaries.\n\nLeuba doesn\u2019t condemn the show \u2013 but she certainly wants to open up the conversation about how Gauguin\u2019s oeuvre speaks to us, and how our view of Polynesian culture has been coloured by a Western art tradition.\n\n\u201cFor my Illusions series, I picked up Gauguin\u2019s colour palette and staging, and used it to reframe the image of Polynesian women in art, pushing past the boundaries of binary gender representations, and creating an empowered portrait of indigenous Polynesian femininity,\u201d Leuba tells BBC Culture. But while her photographs might use familiar signifiers \u2013 the fruit, the flowers, the colours \u2013 the images also have a smooth, glossy, hyper-real quality.\n\nRather than exoticise the sitters\u2019 brown skin (as, arguably, Gauguin did), Leuba takes a more surreal approach: her models are painted with very bright body paint, in hot, tropical colours. Painting literally on the body reminds the viewer of the way Western art has painted such bodies as \u2018exotic\u2019 and \u2018other\u2019, on canvas. By blurring the boundaries between myth and reality in her pictures, she hopes to \u201cquestion the reality of the primitivist depictions and narratives produced by Western gaze and art history\u201d.\n\nAnd by painting her transgender sitters with eye-poppingly bright purple or pink, Leuba also highlights the similar artificiality of the accepted narrow narratives told about Polynesian women \u2013 or, indeed, women in general. What is femininity; how has it traditionally been coded and signified in art \u2013 and who is allowed to perform it, to paint themselves that way?\n\nThe third gender\n\nWithin Tahitian society, there has in fact long been an established place and role for a third gender, the feminine male. Leuba\u2019s subjects were biologically male at birth, but now identify as female, or perform femininity, in various ways. Broadly, these come under two terms in Tahiti: M\u0101h\u016b, an effeminate man, and Rae-rae, a transgender woman.\n\n\u201cM\u0101h\u016b all have the manhood of a man and all the sensitivity of a woman. They have existed since the beginning of time and they have always been part of Polynesian society and culture,\u201d Leuba elaborates. \u201cWhen the missionaries came to Tahiti, M\u0101h\u016b were arrested and not accepted by the Christian society. However, luckily things have changed, and in today\u2019s society they are accepted as they are.\u201d Many M\u0101h\u016b are dancers and performers, and she found working with them \u201ca culturally rich and joyous experience\u201d.\n\nGauguin himself depicted androgynous figures in his paintings\n\n\u201cThe difference between Rae-rae and M\u0101h\u016b was distinguished around 1960s, when transgender people had opportunities to start transforming and changing themselves,\u201d says Lueba. M\u0101h\u016b are regarded as an integral part of the M\u0101ori tradition but Rae-rae are generally less accepted in Tahiti. Rae-rae are regarded more of an equivalent to the drag queens of the Western world and they have closer ties to homosexuality, in contrast to M\u0101h\u016b which identify more with femininity and \u2018sweetness\u2019.\u201d\n\nLeuba wanted to work with the sitters in order to \u201creframe the ideas of sexualised Tahitian women by reclaiming their identity and empowering themselves\u201d. But she\u2019s not the first artist to be inspired by the M\u0101h\u016b. Gauguin himself depicted androgynous figures in his paintings; it\u2019s been suggested that the \u2018man\u2019 in Marquesan Man in the Red Cape, a painting included in the Portraits show, could have been inspired by M\u0101h\u016b, as has the ambiguous figure in Pape Moi. Likewise, the central character in his masterpiece Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? has been claimed by some art historians as M\u0101h\u016b.\n\nIndeed, it was a sense that Gauguin\u2019s possible images of M\u0101h\u016b were also eroticised that prompted another contemporary visual artist to take M\u0101h\u016b as their subject. Just earlier this year, Kehinde Wiley \u2013 Obama\u2019s official portraitist \u2013 exhibited a show in Paris called Tahiti. It featured portraits of M\u0101h\u016b painted against brightly patterned backgrounds, in poses that recall those of Gauguin\u2019s works \u2013 but with a direct gaze and bags of added attitude.\n\nWiley has made a career of innovative portraiture that uses the traditions of Western art to celebrate and give status to people of colour, depicting them in the style of Old Masters, with a revisionist lens. But Wiley\u2019s aim with Tahiti was to \u201creference and confront Paul Gauguin's celebrated works\u2026 fraught with historical undertones of colonialism and sexual objectification\u201d.\n\nCan we appreciate \u2018good\u2019 work by \u2018bad\u2019 people?\n\nHe didn\u2019t just tear Gauguin down, however: that would be trite, the artist told Artnet at the time, adding that he thought his job was to \u201csomehow imagine a newness within that bankrupt vocabulary\u201d. His portraits \u2013 like Leuba\u2019s \u2013 were made in collaboration and conversation with his M\u0101h\u016b sitters, to give them personal agency in their own self-presentation, as they crafted \u201ccounter-poses\u201d to the old familiar narratives from Gauguin. Some choose traditional clothing and elaborate feathered headdresses; some preferred red lace minidresses.\n\nWho is allowed to make art about whom \u2013 and whether we can still appreciate \u2018good\u2019 work by \u2018bad\u2019 people \u2013 are questions that, today, arise with increasing regularity, force, and thorniness. It can be hard to simply revel in the heat and colour of Gauguin\u2019s Polynesian portraits today, knowing what we do about him. They are strange and beautiful images, artistically exploratory, but also exploitative. And it\u2019s impossible to look at them without feeling discomfort at the work\u2019s very male, very colonial gaze.\n\nAnd unlike Wiley\u2019s portraits, we can\u2019t look Gauguin\u2019s subjects in the eye: there is something deeply troubling in the women\u2019s placid, averted, side-eyed expressions, their gaze always sliding away from us. Is this the wish-fulfilment of artist/sexual predator, an image of idealised, languid feminine passivity and cultural serenity? Is it a reflection of their powerlessness? Or could it be defiance \u2013 a glazed, protective, you\u2019ll-never-really-know-me stare? Well, we\u2019ll never know either.\n\nPerhaps one solution to the discomfort around the continuing celebration of work that now feels so problematic is \u2013 rather than dismissing it all outright or attempting to hide the awkward bits \u2013 to multiply the narratives we tell elsewhere, to make sure we offer new perspectives. A different lens, and a different gaze. Which is why it feels particularly cheering that Leuba\u2019s work is being shown at an art gallery dedicated to women. Her photographs, and Wiley\u2019s paintings, both invite the viewer to look a little closer, to ask if the stories and stereotypes we\u2019ve become used to may be nothing more than illusions.\n\nIllusions \u2013 The Myth of the Vahine Through Gender Dysphoria is part of the group show Notre Dame / Our Lady at Boogie Wall until 27 October 2019.\n\nGauguin\u2019s Portraits is at the National Gallery until 26 January 2020.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.
