Their stay is the first visit to Pakistan by members of the royal family since 2006.", "description": "The Duchess of Cambridge arrived in Pakistan with a nod to both her hosts and the memory of her mother-in-law, wearing a traditional shalwar-kameez style outfit from one of Princess Diana's favourite couture houses.", "authors": ["Ben Farmer"], "top_image": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/3-HwQJAGpeM/mqdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
