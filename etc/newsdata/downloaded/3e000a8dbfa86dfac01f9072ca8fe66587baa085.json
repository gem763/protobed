Zitt had the help of his father-in-law, Horst Helle, painter Klaus Ruffing, and several helpful students to give the observatory a transformational lick of paint. Photos of the impressive blue and white design have been shared by science fiction fans everywhere, and even Star Wars actor Mark Hamill tweeted about it. In jest he wrote, \u201cR2-D2 Observatory Transformed Germans Into Giant Nerds.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Zitt is so knowledgeable in the field of science fiction that during 2005, he lectured in numerous other universities as well as Europe\u2019s biggest Science Fiction Convention, FedCon. In 2008, he wrote the preface of the book Star Trek in Germany, and in the same year, the professor also became a regular lecturer at the The University of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio, Texas teaching \u201cThe Physics of Star Trek.\u201d\n\nProfessor Hubert Zitt transformed the Zweibr\u00fcck Observatory of the Natural Science Association into a giant replica of R2-D2.\n\nThe avid sci-fi fan had the help of his father-in-law, Horst Helle, painter Klaus Ruffing, and several helpful students to give the observatory a transformational lick of paint.\n\nPhotos of their design have been shared by sci-fi fans all over the world.\n\nEven Star Wars actor Mark Hamill tweeted about it.\n\nR2-D2 Observatory Transformed Germans Into Giant Nerds https://t.co/s4vUwKGxEP via @LaughingSquid \u2014 Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) March 22, 2019\n\nZweibr\u00fccken University of Applied Sciences / Hochschule Kaiserslautern: Website | Facebook\n\nh/t: [Design You Trust, Laughing Squid, Bored Panda]\n\nAll images via Zweibr\u00fccken University of Applied Sciences / Hochschule Kaiserslautern.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nR2-D2 Coffee Press Is the Perfect Droid to Start Your Day off Right\n\nCustom Vehicle Wrap Turns Old VW Bus into \u201cStar Wars\u201d R2-D2\n\nDelightful Illustrations Depict R2-D2 Dressed as Other Superheroes", "description": "Professor Hubert Zitt transformed the Zweibr\u00fccken Observatory of the Natural Science Association into a giant replica of R2-D2.", "authors": ["Today Is Art Day", "Secret Wood"], "top_image": "https://mymodernmet.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/giant-r2-d2-replica-hubert-zitt-thumbnail-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-26"}
