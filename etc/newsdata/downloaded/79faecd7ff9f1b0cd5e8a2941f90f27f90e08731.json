Zuckerberg was asked to respond to Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s comment that billionaires should not exist, and gave a surprising answer given that Zuckerberg himself is worth $69 billion.\n\n\u201cI understand where he\u2019s coming from,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I have an exact threshold on what amount of money someone should have but on some level no one deserves to have that much money.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg was also asked about comments he made during two separate leaked internal Q&A sessions he had with employees in July. Zuckerberg is quoted as saying: \u201cYou have someone like Elizabeth Warren that thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies \u2026 I mean, if she gets elected president then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg adds: \u201cAnd does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. I mean, that\u2019s not the position that you want to be in when you\u2019re, you know, I mean \u2026 It\u2019s like, we care about our country, and want to work with our government and do good things. But look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and fight.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg stated in the recent public Q&A that he stands by his comments about Warren but added: \u201clet\u2019s try not to antagonize her further.\u201d Zuckerberg was also asked about how the firm determines what counts as fake news that should be removed, Zuckerberg clarified that the main objective is to stamp out \u201ccomplete and obvious hoaxes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about misinformation, a lot of people focus on a statement that isn\u2019t clear if it\u2019s a shade of true or partially false,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff that people say that is completely false. That\u2019s the thing that I\u2019m really focused on and making sure that we [stop].\u201d\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
