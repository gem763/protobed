She said she was required to attend counselling sessions with the head of teaching and school chaplain.\n\nColvin has lodged a discrimination case with the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal under the state\u2019s Equal Opportunity Act 2010. The tribunal is yet to list the case for a directions date or hearing. Equality Australia is providing support to Colvin in pursuing the case.\n\n\u201cI loved my job. I am an extremely hard worker and loyal to a fault, and to have it end the way it did was, at first, professionally humiliating,\u201d Colvin said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI see it as a God-given opportunity to stand up for what is right, to represent what God is really about: loving others.\u201d\n\nGuardian Australia understands that Colvin\u2019s statement of claim alleges the school told her in a meeting last year that parents would leave if they found out she was teaching at the college with her pro-marriage equality beliefs.\n\nColvin, a committed Christian and mother of three, said she\u2019s bringing the case to let LGBT students know that they aren\u2019t \u201cdeformed\u201d.\n\nWith Israel Folau the church demands a kind of free speech that keeps gays in the firing line | David Marr Read more\n\n\u201cThey were created as they are, in the image of God, and that they are fully loved by God and share equal dignity with all human beings,\u201d she said.\n\nThe school updated its constitution last year following the legalising of same sex marriage in 2017.\n\n\u201cGod designed the two genders, male and female, for the purpose of joy and procreation within the sole relationship of marriage. So a marriage can only be between a male and a female, and upon this foundation alone should children be conceived and families formed,\u201d the clause says.\n\nColvin, who grew up in an evangelical Christian family in the US and has served as a missionary, refused to support that statement of faith.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rachel Colvin has taken legal action against Ballarat Christian College, claiming she was forced to resign for personally disagreeing with the college\u2019s anti-marriage equality stance. Photograph: Equality Australia\n\nThe school declined to comment, referring media enquiries to Christian Schools Australia spokesman, Mark Spencer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely come out of the blue for the school,\u201d Spencer told Guardian Australia.\n\n\u201cThis is fundamentally a claim around whether Christian and other faith based schools can continue to hold and teach their beliefs around this and other issues of importance to them.\u201d\n\nHe said the statement of faith was standard across Christian schools.\n\nWhat is the religious discrimination bill and what will it do?

The next question will be \u2018what do you think Miss?\u2019 We don\u2019t want teachers to teach something that they don\u2019t believe in.\u201d\n\nAsked what message the saga sends to same sex students at the school Spencer said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t send any message. The school has strong pastoral care policies and cares for all of its students.\n\n\u201cYou can still care for people and love them even though you have different beliefs.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, the school was vandalised and closed for a day after the principal had urged the school community to oppose marriage equality in an email to parents.\n\nThe general secretary of the Victorian Independent Education Union, Debra James, said in statement: \u201cIt is not acceptable for a worker to be forced out of employment simply for refusing to support a divisive statement which is at odds with their own beliefs and out of step with values of tolerance and inclusivity.\n\n\u201cFaith-based schools are entitled to affirm their own beliefs, but it is clearly a step too far to require educators to expressly support values or statements that they believe are in conflict with their duty of care towards their students.\u201d\n\nThe case comes as the federal government pushes ahead with a controversial religious discrimination bill and as former rugby star Israel Folau takes legal action against Rugby Australia claiming unfair dismissal on religious grounds.\n\nFolau\u2019s multimillion dollar contract was terminated over a social media post in which he paraphrased a Bible passage, saying \u201cdrunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists and idolaters\u201d would go to hell unless they repented.", "description": "Rachel Colvin says Ballarat Christian College pressured her to resign over her beliefs about same-sex marriage", "authors": ["Lisa Martin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32ad1b8b57ab58a8c4c4ad0d86c6296cb89961c1/144_1_1255_753/master/1255.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8ed6e3bdec3c513a30b7a9fb706b5e3d", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
