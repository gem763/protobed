He is using the highest office in the land to advance his personal political interests instead of the national interest.\"\n\nThe former vice president rebukes Trump over public comments calling for Ukraine and China to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, over unfounded allegations of corruption. Joe Biden argues that Trump's new push shows that \"he considers the presidency a free pass to do whatever he wants, with no accountability.\"\n\n\"Our first president, George Washington, famously could not tell a lie. President Trump seemingly cannot tell the truth \u2014 about anything,\" he notes. \"He slanders anyone he sees as a threat. That is why is he is frantically pushing flat-out lies, debunked conspiracy theories and smears against me and my family, no doubt hoping to undermine my candidacy for the presidency.\"\n\n\"This time, it won\u2019t work, because the American people know me \u2014 and they know him,\" Joe Biden adds, before promising to put his decorated history of public service up against Trump's \"lack of integrity.\"\n\nHe later argues that the defining trait of Trump's presidency is the \"abuse of power\" through attempts to extract political favors from foreign nations.\n\nThe op-ed comes in light of a wave of revelations regarding Trump's interactions with Ukraine that have prompted a formal impeachment inquiry in the House. A whistleblower complaint from an intelligence community official accuses Trump of enlisting Ukraine's help in his 2020 reelection efforts.\n\nA White House memo of Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also confirms that the president asked the foreign leader to work with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiDefense chief on Ukraine: 'My aim is to keep the department apolitical' Trump slams 'ass' Romney for criticizing Ukraine dealings Trump lawyer Giuliani tells Fox his mission is 'to disrupt the world' MORE and Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrHouse Democrats subpoena White House for Ukraine documents Hillicon Valley: Iranian hacking operation targeted campaign, government accounts | House panel pushes Zuckerberg to testify on Libra | Trump officials step up attacks on Facebook encryption Cornyn makes waves with tweet about Justice investigating Biden MORE to investigate the Biden family.\n\nTrump and his campaign have continued their effort to portray Joe Biden as corrupt amid the revelations. Speaking to reporters last Thursday, Trump called on both Ukraine and China to investigate the 2020 presidential candidate.\n\n\"To Trump and those who facilitate his abuses of power, and all the special interests funding his attacks against me: Please know that I\u2019m not going anywhere,\" Joe Biden concludes in his op-ed in the Post. \"You won\u2019t destroy me, and you won\u2019t destroy my family. And come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.\"", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate\u00a0Joe Biden on Saturday\u00a0is voicing outrage over what he calls President Trump's persistent efforts to \"destroy\" him and his family, vowing to beat the president \"like a drum\" in the 2020 election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpbiden2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
