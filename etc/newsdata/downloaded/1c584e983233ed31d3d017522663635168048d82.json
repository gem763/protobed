One of the largest exporters of rice in the world, the country produces more than 20m tonnes each year.\n\nMore than 80% of the country\u2019s arable land is cultivated for rice production, and at least 15 million smallhold farmers rely on rice production for their livelihoods.\n\nTrang Tran grew up among this culture. It\u2019s what inspired her to create Fargreen, a social enterprise dedicated to building sustainable farming communities.\n\nShe witnessed how the farmers would burn the excess rice straw (the waste product from the crop) to destroy it, drawing carbon dioxide into the air and damaging their lungs.\n\n\u201cThey burn it openly in the fields, it affects their health and the health of the people \u2013 especially the farmers who are among the poorest in the country,\u201d says Tran.\n\nAlthough Vietnam has made huge strides in reducing poverty, most of Vietnam\u2019s rural poor are farmers, earning as little as $3 (\u00a32) per day.\n\n\u201cSeeing this, I was inspired to find a sustainable solution to balance this all, to stop the burning act and at the same time provide the farmers with more income,\u201d she says.\n\nThe country burns an estimated 40m tonnes of rice straw as a byproduct, releasing more than one tonne of toxic carbon dioxide and nitrogen monoxide into the environment for every tonne of rice straw burned.\n\nThe practice takes place in other rice-producing countries, such as the Philippines and India, too. Tran says it was even happening in the US and Japan before it was banned.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Some farmers have seen their income go up by 50% by joining Fargreen\u2019s cooperative\n\n\u201cThe scale of the problem is complex. It\u2019s the cheapest and quickest way for farmers to get rid of waste so they can start another crop. They\u2019re aware of the consequences of breathing in smoke, but they still have to do it because no one can take care of this waste for them,\u201d says Tran.\n\nIn 2012, Tran started working on a solution for Vietnam\u2019s rice farmers while she was studying for an MBA at Colorado State University in the US. Three years later, she founded Fargreen, based on the environmentally friendly closed-loop production techniques, aiming to benefit local farmers while reducing waste.\n\nIn 2016, Fargreen joined the United Nations\u2019 Business Call to Action (BctA), pledging to help 1,000 smallhold rice farmers build environmentally sustainable livelihoods, increasing their income by 50%. BCtA aims to accelerate the UN sustainable development goals through inclusive business models.\n\nFargreen works as a cooperative, helping farmers work together to introduce mushroom growing as an additional produce. It buys the waste rice straw from farmers who are part of their network, and involves them in the process of growing edible mushrooms using the rice straw as the only substrate \u2013 which effectively means the rice straw acts as a soil for the mushrooms.\n\nOnce the mushrooms are harvested, they\u2019re sold under the Fargreen brand. Farmers who are part of the cooperative get a monthly base salary, giving them stability if production is low.\n\nFarmers produce rice twice a year and can only earn income when they sell the rice. Between seasons, many will head to cities to find extra work. Mushroom production takes place throughout the year, so Fargreen hopes to bridge the gap between rice seasons so that farmers and their families don\u2019t have to leave their homes in search of other jobs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a sustainable green community where all their food-producing activities such as rice farming, vegetable garden and mushroom production all happen in a closed loop. The waste from one will be recycled for the production of another,\u201d says Tran.\n\n\u201cIn a country such as Vietnam, which is one of the most affected by climate change, there\u2019s a chicken and egg situation. Farmers are having a hard time with crops because of climate change and pollution. So with this solution, we\u2019re tackling multiple things at the same time.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harvested mushrooms are sold under the Fargreen brand.\n\nFargreen is currently working with 50 farmers in the Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh province, and piloting in three other villages. \u201cThey [the farmers] are creating the pressure for us to expand so more farmers can join us,\u201d she says.\n\nThe company aims to prevent more than 4,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases from being released into the environment. The process also creates biofertiliser, meaning the farmers can move away from using damaging chemical fertilisers.\n\nWhy tackling poverty and climate change should go hand in hand Read more\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re able to provide them with this safe and non-chemical environment,\u201d says Tran. \u201cFarmers can still do what they do, but with higher income.\u201d\n\nBut Fargreen didn\u2019t come without challenges, says Tran. \u201cFrom raising capital, starting any business is hard. This business is even harder because we\u2019re working with the community.\u201d\n\nFargreen hopes to up the standards of food production. \u201cWe\u2019re aiming for an upscale market, where they have a very strict standard about their food \u2013 we want our farmers to get to that level, so they\u2019ll own more in a more sustainable way. It\u2019s hard to survive in the market and it takes a lot of time to train the farmers to be confident with the standards that we set.\u201d\n\nDespite these hurdles, Tran says the farmers have already seen the benefits of this business.\n\nOne woman with young children, whose husband went to the city to find work, joined Fargreen after struggling to find a job in a factory. As a farmer with Fargreen, her income has now increased by 50%, so she is able to support her family. \u201cHopefully, we can bring people back to the field,\u201d says Tran.\n\nPart of Fargreen\u2019s success is working in the form of a cooperative. \u201cIt\u2019s the way of living here \u2013 if you come to most villages it\u2019s very natural that it\u2019s a community. If we work with villages as a whole, as a community, we\u2019ll be able to look after one another. We are trying to integrate everybody into the system,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cHaving good, safe food and a safer environment go hand in hand. With a better environment, we\u2019ll have better food crop. It\u2019s a social security for everyone.\u201d", "description": "Vietnam burns 40m tonnes of rice straw as a byproduct of its rice production, releasing vast quantities of carbon dioxide into the air.
