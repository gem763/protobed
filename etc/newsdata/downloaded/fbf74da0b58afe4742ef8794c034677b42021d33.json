They Haven\u2019t Decided Why.", "language": "en", "text": "Through their debate over the articles, Democrats might have to decide what\u2019s more important: pursuing a matter that they believe has the most obvious political utility\u2014or making a more comprehensive statement about how an American president is allowed to act.\n\nEach of Trump\u2019s offenses \u201chave a legal and a literary dimension to them,\u201d in that they tell a story to the American people, Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland told me in a recent interview, comparing the articles of impeachment to the Declaration of Independence, in which Thomas Jefferson listed 27 grievances against King George III. \u201cThe story needs to come through as well,\u201d said Raskin, a member of the Judiciary Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s not just this random, one-off thing.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, House Democrats agree that the Ukraine scandal is the most pressing of the allegations against the president: Trump asked a foreign leader, the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, and has subsequently tried to stonewall Congress\u2019s attempts to investigate. Pelosi and others argue it\u2019s the most straightforward example of Trump\u2019s abuse of power; it\u2019s more easily digestible than anything Special Counsel Robert Mueller dug up; and, because it involves a Democratic presidential frontrunner, it\u2019s also much more relevant to the upcoming election. Plus: The president\u2019s ask to Ukraine is what persuaded so many moderates to endorse an impeachment inquiry in the first place. That combination of clarity and urgency, many Democrats believe, should be enough to rustle up much more public support than before for the impeachment inquiry, which the latest national polls show a slim majority of Americans support.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was a really discreet and comprehensive bite-sized example of something we should be concerned about,\u201d Representative Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania told me. She was one of seven freshman lawmakers to endorse the inquiry for national-security reasons in an op-ed in late September. When it comes time to spell out the articles, her \u201cpersonal preference,\u201d she said, would be \u201cto keep the focus narrow.\u201d\n\nThe current plan is for Democrats, led by the House Intelligence Committee, to continue gathering information about Trump\u2019s request of Ukraine through witness testimony and subpoenaed documents; today, Democrats plan to question the former ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor. Then, after reviewing the evidence, the Judiciary Committee will decide if there are grounds for impeachment. If so, committee members will write the articles\u2014a list of reasons why they think the president should be removed from office\u2014and present them to the full House for a vote. Former President Andrew Johnson, for example, faced a total of 11 articles, spanning from his violation of the Tenure of Office Act to bringing \u201ccontempt, ridicule and disgrace\u201d to the presidency. By contrast, former President Bill Clinton faced two: for lying under oath and obstruction of justice. If the House votes to approve any of the individual articles, Trump will be formally impeached, and his case will go to the Senate for trial.", "description": "Will lawmakers keep their focus on Ukraine, or try to paint a broader portrait of the president\u2019s wrongdoing?", "authors": ["Elaine Godfrey"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_19290559433588/facebook.jpg?1571690195", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
