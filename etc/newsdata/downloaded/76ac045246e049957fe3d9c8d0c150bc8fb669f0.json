That is the dilemma facing Pep Guardiola. 'Every press conference I talk about Raheem!' he said, seemingly exasperated. Yet, he broke into a smile and did his best nonetheless.\n\n'What I like the most about Raheem was one thing,' he said. 'After he scored three goals against Atalanta, made an assist and won a penalty, everybody speaks in the media and everywhere: \"How good you are!\" Normally the next game always you play a little bit like: \"Ah! How good I am!\"\n\n'And it was the complete the opposite. He played like Phil Foden, who played for 15 minutes as though it were the last 15 minutes of his life. That is our strength as a team in the last years together. Today Raheem played all the minutes. I am so proud of him!'\n\nIlkay Gundogan put daylight between the two sides as he made it 3-0 with 20 minutes of the second half to play on Saturday\n\nThe Germany international kept his head over the ball and guided the ball into the empty net with an acrobatic scissor kick\n\nThe Manchester City midfielder leaps into the air to celebrate adding a third goal for City on what was a dominant afternoon\n\nFernandinho (on the floor) was shown a second yellow card and therefore sent off late on by referee Graham Scott\n\nMATCH FACTS Man City: Ederson, Joao Cancelo, Stones, Fernandinho, Mendy (Angelino 73), De Bruyne (Foden 76), Gundogan, Silva, Bernardo Silva, Gabriel Jesus, Sterling (Aguero 76). Subs not used: Bravo, Walker, Jose, Mahrez, Otamendi.

Yellow cards: Grealish Referee: Graham Scott (Oxfordshire)\n\nGuardiola's enthusiasm stems from more than the fact that Sterling in an extraordinary run of form. 'He's pretty much unplayable at the moment,' said Dean Smith. It's the authority he carries throughout this team. When Guardiola arrived here in 2016, he was a fine player but not a leader. He existed on fringes, doing exceptional things but looking to others to bend the game to their will.\n\nNow quite the reverse. In a team including some of the world's best players, it is Sterling who often leads the way. Guardiola was reflecting on a first-half performance that was some way short of City at their best. 'I like to use this word aggressive when you have the ball,' he said. 'And the only player who was aggressive in the first half was Raheem. I think, in the second half, we imitate him, he show us the way how to play.\n\n'And it was much better. Be aggressive is the way you make a movement, how you make a build-up better, how you make a pass, how you attack, how you arrive to score a goal. Be aggressive with the ball. And were not aggressive in the first half.'\n\nSince stepping up off the pitch this year, to take a lead on racism issues and addressing us in the media as to our responsibilities, he has also thrived on the pitch. He looks a complete man. And his game is all the better for it.\n\nManchester City are now three points behind Liverpool. Of course, Liverpool have Tottenham to play and so can extend their lead. But still, psychologically, as Guardiola acknowledged, it feels a lot better than being eight points behind. And, for once, City were on the right side of a controversial VAR call.\n\nRaheem Sterling gave Manchester City the lead in the first minute of the second half as he passed the ball past Tom Heaton\n\nAston Villa defender Tyrone Mings failed to head away a long ball from Ederson and the ball fell to Sterling who capitalised\n\nSterling (right) celebrates with his City team-mates having given Pep Guardiola's side the lead early in the second half\n\nKevin De Bruyne was at first credited for Manchester City's second goal but after the match it was given to David Silva\n\nThe goal was reviewed by VAR to check if Silva had touched it and therefore Sterling would have been offside but it was given\n\nBut they had to endure that sticky first half to get there. Aston Villa were very good for 45 minutes here, full of diligent commitment to their shape, which was loosely 4-3-3 but 4-5-1 for long periods. And no-one was more impressive than Jack Grealish in his commitment to track back and harry, with England manager Gareth Southgate watching on.\n\nVilla were not so good though that they could deny City chances and Gabriel Jesus on five minutes and David Silva on 44 minutes both should have scored. But there were also moments when Ederson was forced to parry away a John McGinn strike on 23 minutes, which then saw Douglas Luiz tackled as he attempted to bundle over the rebound. In short, there was a contest of sorts.\n\nAnd yet, all Dean Smith's good work and half-time words were rendered useless within 46 seconds of the restart. Conceding so early from a kick-off is pretty unforgiveable; to do so from your own kick off is wholly unpardonable.\n\nAnd it showed a facet of City's game about which Guardiola rarely boasts. Ederson's arrival in 2017 and his ability to play long and accurately from the back was the point at which Guardiola's City stopped looking vulnerable. It is only an occasional option but was well utilised here.\n\nVilla played long from their kick off, lost the ball and Ederson recovered it, He played it long to Gabriel Jesus, who, beating Tyrone Mongs in the air \u2013 Dean Smith wasn't happy \u2013 flicked it on to Sterling, who simply sprinted past Bjorn Engels and nut-megged Tom Heaton. Somewhere celestial, Graham Taylor looked down and smiled.\n\nFernandinho, who usually plays in midfield, was back at the heart of defence again for Pep Guardiola's side on Saturday\n\nKevin De Bruyne went down after receiving a bump on the head but was able to pick himself back up and carry on\n\nDavid Silva attemps a reverse pass to his team-mates under pressure from Marvelous Nakamba at the Etihad Stadium\n\nAston Villa left-back Matt Targett looks to get his team up the field as Jack Grealish spins away from Fernandinho in midfield\n\nManchester City striker Gabriel Jesus shoots wide of the post in the first half as he tried to make a breakthrough for the hosts\n\n'All the good work had gone,' lamented Smith. 'You applaud Man City for intricate patterns and passing but this was a 70-yard punt from the goalkeeper and defensively we didn't deal with it well enough.'\n\nThen came the VAR controversy. Find a comfy chair before settling down for this. On 64 minutes David Silva played a short corner which ended up with Kevin De Bruyne taking a strike at goal. David Silva claimed a touch. He was onside. Sterling might have got a touch as he dodged out of the way of the ball a few yards in front of Heaton. He was offside.\n\nJonathan Moss the VAR spent two and half minutes examining it. He couldn't confirm that Silva had touched it. Had he done so, he would have had to call whether Sterling was seeking to gain an advantage. That was perhaps debateable, though it's hard to see how he wasn't.\n\nSo it was De Bruyne's goal and no offside. Except that later, after the game, the goal accreditation panel gave the goal to Silva. In fact, Silva had, unwisely, eagerly been telling on-field ref Graham Scott that he had touched it. So, VAR couldn't determine whether he had touched it but the goals' panel, a separate group, could. Which is clear as mud.\n\nManchester City defender John Stones, who was partnered by Fernandinho, tries to dribble the ball out of the defence\n\nManchester City midfielder Silva tries to break the deadlock as he attempts an effort on goal in the first half\n\nManchester City's Raheem Sterling in action with Aston Villa's Frederic Guilbert during the match at the Eithad Stadium\n\nDe Bruyne battles for possession with Nakamba in the first half as City were frustrated by the visitors on home soil\n\nManchester City striker Sergio Aguero was left on the bench by manager Guardiola for the match against Aston Villa\n\nStill, the game now was beyond Villa and from a 70th minute corner they conceded their third. The ball was played in to Fernandinho, whose shot across goal was met by Bernardo. Villa cleared that, but only to Gundogan, who, meeting the ball on the half volley, struck home.\n\nThere was time now for that brief impressive Foden cameo and for Fernandinho to pick up a second yellow card, forcing Gundogan to finish the match at centre half. (Presumably Pep Guardiola won't feel he has finished with English football until he has paired De Bruyne and David Silva at the heart of his defence, just to show what is possible). There was still more time for John McGinn, with the last kick of the game, to hit a rasping shot against the post which fortuitously rebounded into the hands of Ederson.\n\nYet for Villa, it was one of those hard lessons the Premier League doles out.
