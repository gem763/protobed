A few took an upbeat approach. At the age of 41, having just given birth to her sixth child, the suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote her friend Susan B. Anthony in 1857 to say that their best activist years lay ahead. \u201cWe shall not be in our prime before fifty & after that we shall be good for twenty years at least.\u201d Others were less sanguine. At 54, writing her memoir, Simone de Beauvoir gloomily prepared to say \u201cgoodbye to all those things I once enjoyed\u201d; women, Freud had taught her, become miserable and sexless as they age. Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, Helen Gurley Brown, Germaine Greer\u2014all warily chronicled their maturity, as of course did the writer who invented the concept of \u201cpassage,\u201d Gail Sheehy. Nora Ephron felt bad about her neck, and her anxiety spawned a best seller.\n\nEven now it\u2019s hard for a woman not to dread the consequences of moving out of youth. One of the wryest recent meditations is an episode of Inside Amy Schumer, in which the eponymous comedian happens upon three of her comedic icons\u2014Tina Fey, Patricia Arquette, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus\u2014picnicking in a meadow. They are celebrating Louis-Dreyfus\u2019s \u201clast fuckable day,\u201d as adjudicated by the media, Fey explains. Schumer, feigning astonishment, asks whether the media do this to men. The trio laughs and laughs.\n\nThree new books about postmenopausal womanhood show that the conversation is changing. For the first time, The New York Times noted early this year, a sizable cohort of women is moving into the sixth and seventh decades of life with a surfeit of energy and workplace experience. Women are better educated than men. Many spend early middle age constrained by work-life challenges, like athletes training with ankle weights. Once the weights come off, they have the muscle to run. Literally: The 2020 slate of female presidential candidates is Exhibit A.\n\nThe landscape looks different due to the #MeToo movement as well. In some ways, it has divided women by generation, yet even older women who may regret a return to the idea of feminine fragility are overjoyed to see workplace predators toppled. The unseating of men like Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer has opened the way for women like Christiane Amanpour and Gayle King to occupy top spots, where they exemplify what 60\u2011something really looks like: pretty freaking great.\n\nFSG\n\nThe current conversation is also informed by evolutionary biology, which evaluates traits based on their reproductive purpose. Given that menopause is nonreproductive by definition, biologists consider it a \u201cbig evolutionary puzzle,\u201d the novelist Darcey Steinke writes in her memoir, Flash Count Diary: Menopause and the Vindication of Natural Life. According to the prevailing view, a human female possesses all the eggs she will have while still in the womb; the number promptly begins diminishing, and by her mid-40s, the remaining ova have deteriorated. To an evolutionary biologist, this is interesting and weird. To Steinke, it was miserable and hard. Her book is lyrical but a bit depressing, because she herself was depressed.", "description": "Why the end of fertility doesn\u2019t mark the start of decline\u2014and may even help explain our success as a species", "authors": ["Liza Mundy", "Darcey Steinke", "Susan Mattern", "Gail Collins"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2019/08/The_Atlantic_menopause_web/facebook.jpg?1566919424", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
