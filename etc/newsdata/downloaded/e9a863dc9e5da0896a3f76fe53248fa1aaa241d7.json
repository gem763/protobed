By mid-morning on Monday, they were digging in for a long wait.\n\nQuick guide The history of Thomas Cook Show Hide Thomas Cook owes its name to a humble and deeply religious 32-year-old cabinet-maker who, one June morning in 1841, hiked the 15 miles from his home in Market Harborough to Leicester, to attend a temperance meeting. The former Baptist preacher believed that the ills of Victorian society stemmed largely from alcohol and, presumably fatigued from his walk, realised he could deploy the power of Britain\u2019s flourishing rail network to help spread the word. Addressing the temperance meeting, he suggested that a train be hired to carry the movement\u2019s supporters to the next meeting in Loughborough. Thus, on 5 July 1841, some 500 passengers travelled by a special train for the 24-mile round trip, paying a shilling apiece. Over the next few years, Cook laid on ever more trains, introducing thousands of Britons to train travel for the first time. The first such outing to be run for commercial purposes was a trip to Liverpool in 1845. Over the next decade or so, the business expanded to offer overseas trips, to France, Switzerland, Italy and beyond, to the US, Egypt and India. His more business-minded son John expanded the tour operator and its reach was such that the government enlisted its expertise in an effort, ultimately in vain, to relieve General Gordon at the siege of Khartoum in 1885. John\u2019s three sons inherited the business, which incorporated as Thos Cook & Son Ltd in 1924 and benefited from the increasing ease of international travel. Its first flirtation with collapse came during the second world war, when the government requisitioned some of its assets and it was sold to Britain\u2019s railway companies, effectively a nationalisation. But it boomed in the postwar years as growing prosperity fuelled the appetite for holidays and it returned to private ownership in 1972. Since then, it has changed hands and changed shape via a series of mergers and takeovers. It nearly collapsed in 2011 but averted its demise with a bailout deal funded by banks. Now, after 178 years of operation, it has ceased trading.\n\n\u201cThey have not got any information on the Newcastle flight,\u201d she said. \u201cAtol [the UK holidaymakers\u2019 protection scheme] have no information but some people are saying it could now be at 9pm.\u201d\n\nShe said she had heard nothing from Thomas Cook and had been worried that the hotel might try to get guests to pay the bills owed by the travel company \u2013 as had happened in Tunisia.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Thomas Cook holidaymakers at Palma airport. Photograph: Jaime Reina/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t check out until the transfer came this morning because we didn\u2019t want what happened in Tunisia to happen to us.\n\n\u201cBut at least we had a good week\u2019s holiday. We\u2019re going to get compensation and there are worse places to be stuck.\u201d\n\nBrown also said she had been touched by the grace and professionalism shown by people who knew their jobs were going.\n\n\u201cThe two reps on the coach thanked us all for the holidays we had taken with Thomas Cook,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd then they started to cry.\u201d\n\nJodie Morgan and her friend Emma Handford, two senior support workers from Pontefract, summed up their treatment by Thomas Cook in a single word: \u201cShit.\u201d\n\nMorgan had rung the company at 8am on Saturday to see if their flights home would be affected and had been told everything would be fine.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fuming,\u201d said Morgan.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain how I\u2019m feeling \u2013 angry, upset. You\u2019re just waiting to find out whether you\u2019ll get home.\u201d\n\nDespite the heavy deployment of hi-vis-jacketed Atol and Foreign Office staff, information and updates were in frustratingly short supply.\n\nLike most passengers, Wendy Hiscocks from south Wales had woken to the news that Thomas Cook had gone under.\n\n\u201cIt was all OK till we woke up this morning and found out what had happened,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we had checked in before we got here. It\u2019s been fine. The transfer turned up and so did the rep.\u201d\n\nShe was hopeful of making the 10.30am flight to Birmingham and thinking of what the news would mean for all those Thomas Cook employees.\n\n\u201cWhat can you do? And it\u2019s such a shame for the poor people who have lost their jobs.\u201d\n\nJohn Marszol, an offshore worker from Glasgow, was similarly philosophical.\n\nHe and his partner, Donna, had been due to take the 10.30am flight home to Glasgow, but the flight was pushed back to 7.40pm on Monday \u2013 and rerouted to Manchester.\n\n\u201cWhen I checked this morning, it said the flight was going to leave for Birmingham at 10.30,\u201d said Marszol.\n\n\u201cThe Atol lassie said it\u2019s going to fly into Manchester now and I\u2019ve got no information on the transfer. We need to know. I didn\u2019t bring my driving licence so we can\u2019t hire a car at Manchester to drive home.\u201d\n\nHe said there had been nothing from Thomas Cook: \u201cYou just get directed to the CAA website.\u201d\n\nStill, he added, the pair had had a lovely week away \u2013 even if \u201cit was too hot for someone from Scotland\u201d.\n\nWith nowhere to go, the couple were focusing on getting someone to feed their three cats.", "description": "Frustration mounts at Palma airport as passengers wait to hear about their journeys home", "authors": ["Sam Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c159d9d8f2ba9b692987b8ea16a6349b80e7d7d/0_426_3776_2266/master/3776.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4a17d0fe04009f14b4d6a12c764808e9"}
