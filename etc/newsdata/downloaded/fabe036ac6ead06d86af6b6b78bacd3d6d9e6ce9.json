He goes to a famous club to a big club and has a new challenge. It was, I think, about five years here.\n\n\u201cFor us, it is a big loss for sure \u2013 but this is what happens in football. For us it will be important that we bring somebody new in and we will do this.\n\n\u201cThis will be the main work for the board and for (chief executive) Martin (Semmens). They are still busy in this part I am sure.\n\n\u201cI have other things to look at and work to do, but I will also have my opinion for this position.\u201d\n\nHasenhuttl said at a press conference: \u201cWe have our plan, our schedule, what we want to do, the players we want to look at.\n\n\u201cIt is independent from Ross. We know what we want to have for our game, for the positions we need and so that doesn\u2019t make a big change in a moment.\u201d\n\nSouthampton will resume domestic action at Wolves on Saturday looking to produce a response following the 4-1 home defeat by Chelsea, which was a third straight Premier League defeat.\n\nHasenhuttl reported no fresh injury problems after international duty, however, full-back Cedric Soares and winger Moussa Djenepo remain sidelined.\n\nSouthampton continue to monitor Djenepo\u2019s progress from a niggling hip muscle problem but will not rush the Mali forward \u2013 a summer signing from Standard Liege \u2013 back into action.\n\n\u201cMoussa can run, he can sprint, he can pass the ball \u2013 but shooting, so far we didn\u2019t do with him because this is the most dangerous movement he can do,\u201d the Southampton boss said.\n\n\u201cWe try to keep it away because when sometimes it is hurting again then it can take longer that he is out.\n\n\u201cI think we must pay attention, we must be very, very patient with him. Today he has a scan again, and then know more how long it will take.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, I am thinking about week of the (two) Manchester City games, that is maybe the hope I have.\u201d", "description": "Wilson, who played a key part in bringing the Austrian coach to St Mary\u00b4s Stadium, has left the club to take up a sporting director role at Rangers.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/12/wire-19834816-1571312958-637_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
