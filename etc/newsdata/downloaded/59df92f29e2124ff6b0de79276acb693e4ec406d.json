They struggle and cry out, (and are) left with sores on their legs.\"\n\nIn one clip, a tube is forced down a distressed dog's throat as a liquid is pumped into its stomach, the group said.\n\nAnother video shows a motionless cat sprawled on a table as a plastic tube runs from its body to a syringe in a worker's hands.\n\n(Image: Cruelty Free International)\n\nAnimals were kept in tiny cages at the facility.\n\nAn undercover SOKO Tierschutz activist worked at the lab between December 2018 and March 2019.\n\nThat group said: \"In this laboratory, poisoning experiments are carried out on dogs, cats, monkeys and rabbits.\"\n\n(Image: Cruelty Free International)\n\nCampaigners are pressuring German and EU officials to shut down the lab.\n\nCFI said: \"Our investigation with SOKO Tierschutz at Laboratory of Pharmacology and Toxicology (LPT) has shed light on the horrors animals face behind closed laboratory doors.\n\n\"Dogs left bleeding and dying, monkeys routinely abused, all in the name of regulatory testing.\n\n(Image: Cruelty Free International)\n\n\"We believe the scale of this abuse and the unimaginable suffering of cats, dogs and monkeys is unlawful. Yet this is the reality of laboratory life for animals, and it cannot continue a moment longer.\"\n\nGerman prosecutors have opened a preliminary investigation for animal cruelty and a local veterinary authority has taken action over the size of the small cages in which 44 of the monkeys were kept, said Cruelty Free International (CFI).\n\nThe local office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety has filed charges, the group said.\n\n(Image: Cruelty Free International/YouTube)\n\nCFI welcomed the action by authorities, but said it was \"too little, too late\".\n\nActivists are holding a protest and a vigil outside the lab on Saturday.\n\nDr Katy Taylor, the group's director of science, said in a statement: \"We do not believe that it goes far enough to protect the animals at this laboratory and others.\n\n(Image: Cruelty Free International)\n\n\"Our evidence show cruelty and breaches of law that we believe mean that LPT should immediately lose its authorisation to carry out animal tests and the facility should be closed down.\n\n\"We also believe that as a priority, an independent investigation should be set up to ensure that similar failings at other animal laboratories in Lower Saxony and Germany as a whole are rooted out as soon as possible.\"\n\nShe added: \"It is imperative that findings from our investigation are not dismissed as an isolated incident.\n\n(Image: Cruelty Free International)\n\n\"This is the real face of toxicity testing on animals throughout Europe and beyond.\n\n\"The EU prides itself on its standards of animal protection.\n\n\"If this is the case, then the new Commission should immediately establish an urgent and comprehensive review of animals used in regulatory toxicology testing.\"\n\nMirror Online has contacted LPT for comment.\n\nLocal authorities have faced questions about why the abuse was not spotted during earlier checks of the facility.\n\nNine inspections - seven of them unannounced - have taken place since 2015, I Am Expat reported.\n\nA police spokesperson has told German media that the \u201cchallenge for the competent authorities is to examine what is and is not allowed under current legislation on animal testing and husbandry and that they will 'consistently remedy all identified grievances... with all legally available means'.\"", "description": "WARNING - DISTRESSING VIDEO: Dogs lay motionless on blood-smeared floors and distressed cats struggle to break free during testing at the Laboratory of Pharmacology and Toxicology in Germany", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Image", "Cruelty Free International", "Cruelty Free International Youtube"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20646438.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Help-us-show-the-world-what-is-happening-behind-closed-laboratory-doors-Help-us-make-it-stop-for-go.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
