At the protest a student speaker with the group Students for Justice in Palestine reportedly read a statement that condoned terrorism and delegitimized Israel.\n\nOfir Dayan is a junior at Columbia University studying political science and the daughter of Dani Dayan, Israel\u2019s consul general in New York.\n\nShe moved to New York from Israel to attend Columbia University and said she had experienced several anti-Semitic incidents at the University. Dayan said she has informed ACF about some of the incidents that had taken place on campus after she said Columbia University did not do anything to address them when she had reported them to school officials.\n\nDayan, the president of Columbia University\u2019s Students Supporting Israel, said her group attended the die-in protest in May and also submitted a complaint: \"Columbia decided to discard it and not do anything about it.\u201d\n\nUN RELEASES FIRST-EVER REPORT ON ANTI-SEMITISM HIGHLIGHTING UPTICK\n\nDayan said the \u201charassment\u201d that Jewish and pro-Israel students face on campus has been documented and presented to Columbia University officials several times, but \u201cthere was always an excuse not to do something about it.\u201d\n\n\u201dFor example, when we complained about a professor, Hamid Dabashi, who wrote on his Facebook page comparing Israel to Isis, he was saying the only difference between Israel and Isis is that Israel has an army of columnists in The New York Times,\u201d Dayan told Fox News.\n\n\u201cSo when we complained to the University\u2019s discrimination and equal opportunity office they said it\u2019s his private Facebook page and freedom of speech so he can say whatever he wants. But at the end of the day he\u2019s teaching classes and people who are sitting in his classes, mainly Jewish people, are scared of being graded by a professor who views them in this way.\u201d\n\nIn May 2018, Dabashi, a tenured Columbia University professor of Iranian studies, was under fire for a controversial series of tweets he fired off following President Trump\u2019s announcement the United States pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nDabashi, who also teaches comparative literature at the Ivy League school, blamed Israel for every \u201cdirty\u201d problem in the world in a tweet posted in May 2018.\n\nCOLUMBIA PROFESSOR UNDER FIRE FOR BLAMING ISRAEL FOR EVERY PROBLEM 'IN THE WORLD'\n\nDabashi did not immediately respond to Fox News\u2019 request for comment.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Columbia is anti-Semitic, I am doing what I am doing because I love Columbia and want to make it a safer and better place for Jewish students,\u201d Dayan told Fox News on Thursday.\n\nA Columbia University spokesperson said in a statement sent to Fox News on Thursday, \u201cColumbia is deeply proud of our thriving Jewish student, faculty and staff communities on campus, the contributions and accomplishments of our Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies Center, and the many other academic initiatives, public programs, and social events that are part of the fabric of Jewish life here.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA statement sent to Fox News from a Barnard College spokeswoman said: \u201cBarnard College values its vibrant Jewish community and is committed to providing all of our students, faculty, and staff with the support and resources they need to express their religious beliefs in a welcoming environment. Anti-Semitism has no place at Barnard and is a direct violation of our non-discrimination policy. We will continue to uphold the rights of everyone on our campus and provide students with the skills and abilities to think critically, deeply, and with moral courage about the complex world around them.\"\n\nFox News\u2019 Caleb Parke and Stephen Sorace contributed to this report.", "description": "A report released on Wednesday refers to Columbia University and its sister school, Barnard College, in New York City as \u201ca hotbed for hate,\u201d documenting \u201csystemic anti-Semitism and an engrained delegitimization of Israel\u201d at the schools.", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
