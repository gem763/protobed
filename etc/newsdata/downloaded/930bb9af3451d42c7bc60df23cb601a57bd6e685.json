Not far from the site of a historic industrial disaster, Ms. Warren described Washington as utterly compromised by the influence of corporations and the extremely wealthy, and laid out a detailed plan for cleansing it.\n\n\u201cCorruption has put our planet at risk, corruption has broken our economy and corruption is breaking our democracy,\u201d Ms. Warren said Monday evening. \u201cI know what\u2019s broken, I\u2019ve got a plan to fix it and that\u2019s why I\u2019m running for president of the United States.\u201d\n\nOnly a few hours later, on a stage outside Albuquerque, President Trump took aim at a different phenomenon that he also described as corruption. Before his own roaring crowd, Mr. Trump cast himself as a bulwark against the power not of corporations but of a \u201cfailed liberal establishment\u201d that he described as attacking the country\u2019s sovereignty and cultural heritage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re battling against the corrupt establishment of the past,\u201d Mr. Trump said, warning in grim language: \u201cThey want to erase American history, crush religious liberty, indoctrinate our students with left-wing ideology.\u201d", "description": "In New York, Senator Elizabeth Warren described a government compromised by the influence of the wealthy.
