But unlike Trump, whose one term is now regarded by much of the right as a best-forgotten political disaster, Carlson advances an ethnonationalist populism that succeeds in a wild, frightening fashion. His secret: competence, a commitment to true political realignment, and a brutal online political machine that represents the full flowering of the tactics and ideology first displayed during 2014\u2019s Gamergate movement.\n\nWhere Trump was a chaotic, undisciplined narcissist, the Carlson who wins in 2024 is a canny political strategist who makes good on Trump\u2019s forgotten promise to embrace anti-corporate economic policies. On paper, parts of Carlson\u2019s agenda seem ripped from the former liberal firebrand Sen. Elizabeth Warren (now in exile in Toronto): His chief enemies are Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft, the megacorporations owned and staffed by wealthy liberals.\n\nIt\u2019s a winning electoral formula: A large minority of Americans are willing to forgive Carlson\u2019s authoritarian, nativist impulses if they see it as part of a war against the out-of-touch, culture-destroying corporations that are automating our jobs; killing every other industry; and exercising complete control over what we watch, read, listen to, buy and believe. And in America, thanks to the Electoral College, winning over a large minority is good enough to regularly win the presidency.", "description": "", "authors": ["Farhad Manjoo", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Tucker-Carlson.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
