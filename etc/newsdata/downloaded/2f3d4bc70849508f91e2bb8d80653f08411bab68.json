Here a few thoughts, informed by being lucky enough to spend close to seven months studying in the Islamic Republic while finishing a doctorate in philosophy on Iranian history. I worked on the Iran desk at the Pentagon during the George W. Bush administration, frequently visit the Persian Gulf, and have followed Iran almost continuously for a quarter century.\n\n1) Pressure can work on Iran. There has been, for more than a decade, a curious line of argument that pressure upon Iran is counterproductive. The Century Foundation\u2019s Dina Esfandiary, for example, tweeted that \u201c#Iran won\u2019t talk as pressure increases because it would be suicide for the government. They will talk when they can get something tangible in return for concessions.\u201d And, using numbers of centrifuges as a metric, Wendy Sherman, an Obama administration negotiator, has repeatedly argued that conciliation trumps coercion on Iran.\n\nBoth Esfandiary and Sherman are wrong, however, to downplay the importance of pressure. As I detail in Dancing with the Devil, a history of U.S. diplomacy with rogue regimes and terrorist groups, there is precedent to the Islamic Republic caving under pressure. For instance, in 1981, Ayatollah Khomeini released U.S. hostages short of achieving his full demands. He did that not because of the persistence of diplomacy, but rather because Iran\u2019s isolation had become too great to bear, especially against the backdrop of the Iran-Iraq War.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "It looks unlikely, but Iran is in a tough spot.", "authors": ["Michael Rubin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sVdNqBUL.5vDbWO7S23w_A--~B/aD0xMDQyO3c9MTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/754ab939ddb8bd5b11465d520deb0212", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
