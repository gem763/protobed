Lindholm, who twice made plays to keep the play in the offensive zone, gained the puck at the point position, moved into the high slot and wired a shot off the far post and into the net for his second of the season.\n\nThen Noah Hanifin tied the score at the 5:32 mark. Hanifin joined a rush and received a sublime pass from Mikael Backlund that left him an empty net to hit for his second tally of the season and eventually force extra time.\n\nNot only did the win put the Flames in the win column, it snapped their losing streak in games that went to the skills competition. They failed to win a shootout game all of last season.\n\nThe Stars have struggled to find their form, but appeared in control early in the third period after Joel L'Esperance opened the scoring with 3:21 left in the second frame. Taking advantage of a Calgary turnover, the Stars raced up the ice and Joel Hanley sent a pass that L'Esperance neatly redirected for his first goal of the season.\n\nCaptain Jamie Benn doubled the Dallas lead nine seconds into the third period. Roope Hintz sent a puck to Benn in the left circle, and he buried the chance for his first goal of the season and his team's first power play goal of the season\n\nBishop made 27 saves through overtime in the loss.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Johnny Gaudreau scored the shootout winner and the Calgary Flames erased a  two-goal deficit in the third period en route to a 3-2 road victory over the ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
