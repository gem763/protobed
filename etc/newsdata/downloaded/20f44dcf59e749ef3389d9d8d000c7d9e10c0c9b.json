I feel worse it is a young player doing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They are the future and if they are diving now, we have massive trouble now in five or 10 years. We didn\u2019t use to accept it. Now we do and I am the only one who goes on about it.\u2019\n\nAhead of tomorrow\u2019s Carabao Cup clash against Manchester United, Lampard took issue with Dyche\u2019s claims and confirmed he felt no reason to warn Hudson-Odoi suggesting Dyche may not have had access to all angles of the incident.\n\n\u2018I said nothing to him, nothing,\u2019 revealed the Chelsea manager. \u2018I asked him straight after the game. He said he got a touch. It might have been light but he had a hand on the back. I am not sure if Sean Dyche saw all the angles.\u2019\n\nMORE: Paul Merson explains why Chelsea are a better team under Frank Lampard than Maurizio Sarri\n\nMORE: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer concedes Chelsea\u2019s young stars step ahead of Manchester United\u2019s", "description": "Frank Lampard has defended Callum Hudson-Odoi after the Chelsea winger faced a barrage of criticism from Burnley boss Sean Dyche.
