REUTERS/Gretchen Ertl\n\n\u201cYou all heard at some point there\u2019s an Asian man running for president who wants to give everyone $1,000 a month,\u201d the 44-year-old New York Democrat said to laughter and cheers inside a packed union hall this month in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nThen he turned serious: \u201cWe\u2019re in an era of economic change, and we need to think differently.\u201d\n\nThat way of thinking has propelled Yang, the Ivy League-educated son of Taiwanese immigrants who would be the country\u2019s first Asian-American president, from what many considered to be an entertaining diversion to a mainstream contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.\n\nNow Yang\u2019s campaign, which began in 2017 but has seen its fortunes rise sharply in recent months, is rushing to catch up with rivals.\n\nHe stands near 3% in the latest public opinion polls, putting him in sixth place in the 19-candidate field ahead of numerous sitting lawmakers. His $10 million fundraising haul in the third quarter was the sixth-most among Democrats and more than triple his total for the second quarter.\n\nMost importantly, he continues to inspire a fervent following known as the Yang Gang, supporters who wear blue \u201cMATH\u201d hats - a tribute to Yang\u2019s devotion to data that has since become an acronym for \u201cMake America Think Harder\u201d - and revel in his \u201cnerdy\u201d campaign.\n\nWhen Yang promised to become the first president to use PowerPoint in a State of the Union address, the Las Vegas crowd chanted, \u201cPowerPoint! PowerPoint!\u201d\n\nYang\u2019s central message \u2013 that automation is destroying U.S. jobs and that his \u201cFreedom Dividend\u201d is the best way to mitigate the damage \u2013 has particularly resonated with young, male Democrats, independents and some Republicans, according to Reuters/Ipsos polls.\n\nIn that sense, Yang appears to be drawing many of the same types of voters U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders did in his unexpectedly strong outsider run for the White House in 2016.\n\nAccording to Reuters polling data, Sanders supporters are three times as likely to choose Yang as their second favorite than backers of either U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren or former Vice President Joe Biden, the other two leading contenders.\n\nLas Vegas resident Kelsey McCormick, 30, said she \u201cfell in love\u201d with Yang after hearing about his universal basic income proposal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s refreshing for a politician to say he\u2019ll give people what they need without telling them how to use it,\u201d she said.\n\nBUILDING A \u2018YANG GANG\u2019 GROUND GAME\n\nBuoyed by last quarter\u2019s cash infusion, Yang\u2019s team is aggressively hiring in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, just in time for the crucial stretch ahead of the first nominating contests in February.\n\nYang\u2019s aides, while reluctant to share precise figures, said the campaign staff - currently in excess of 75 - had tripled since Sept. 1 and would triple again by Nov. 1.\n\nThe hiring spree is aimed at translating Yang\u2019s online strength \u2013 including Yang Gang volunteers across the country \u2013 into on-the-ground operations such as neighborhood canvassing and phone banks.\n\nSeveral Democratic officials in New Hampshire and Iowa said Yang\u2019s ground operations still lag well behind those of his main rivals, including Warren, Biden, Sanders and others, who were able to build up teams earlier in the year.\n\nLast week, Yang staffers held a two-day retreat in New York City, where they mapped out strategy and played appropriately nerdy bonding games, like presidential trivia.\n\nThe campaign, whose top aides early on were all political neophytes, has brought on more than a half-dozen seasoned Democratic operatives since the summer.\n\nOne of those new hires is national organizing director Zach Fang, who oversaw field operations in several states for Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign and previously worked for Democratic U.S. Representative Tim Ryan\u2019s presidential campaign this year.\n\nLike many of Yang\u2019s supporters, Fang said he joined because Yang\u2019s focus on automation made sense to him after he spent time working in Silicon Valley, where he saw firsthand the way technology was threatening traditional work.\n\n\u201cThere was no one else saying what Andrew was saying,\u201d Fang said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how many other \u2018me\u2019s\u2019 there were out there in the world.\u201d\n\nDuring the Las Vegas town hall, Yang dismissed the various theories propagated by cable television pundits as reasons for Trump\u2019s victory in 2016: racism, Russia, Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cThe real catalyst and the numbers \u2013 I\u2019m a numbers guy \u2013 is that we automated away four million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Iowa,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if that list of states sounds familiar, those are the states that Donald Trump needed to win, and did win.\u201d\n\nYang said Nevada, which relies heavily on its hospitality industry, will lose more jobs to automation than any other state, noting that MGM Resorts International has announced plans to replace bartenders with robots at its casinos.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of the greatest economic transformation in the history of our country, what experts are calling the fourth industrial revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen is the last time you heard a politician say the words \u2018fourth industrial revolution\u2019?\u201d", "description": "Entrepreneur Andrew Yang knows most people initially viewed his candidacy for U.S. president \u2013 and his campaign promise to guarantee every American a basic, government-funded income \u2013 as a gimmick.", "authors": ["Joseph Ax", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440334377&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0B9-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
