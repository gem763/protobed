If you want a final say on Brexit \u2013 Vote Labour. If you want to fight for Remain \u2013 Vote Labour. Labour will let the people decide\u201d.\n\nStarmer was joined by fellow frontbenchers Emily Thornberry and Clive Lewis at a large People's Vote rally on the first day of the conference, at which many delegates demanded outright support for Remain.\n\nMr Corbyn's plan, approved by show of hands, envisages a Labour government negotiating a \"credible\" Brexit deal within three months of taking power, with the UK remaining in the EU's customs union and maintaining a close single market relationship, while safeguarding European-style workplace, environmental and consumer protections.\n\nThe plan commits Labour to a referendum within six months, but leaves the question of which side the party would take to be decided at a special conference after the election. Starmer announced that Labour would legislate to fix the date of the referendum \"immediately\" after taking office.\n\nFollowing the vote, close Corbyn ally Diane Abbott said: \"The message is - despite the chatter from commentators- the party is determined to unite behind its leader.\"\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It is possible that the Remain motion had a majority in the constituency Labour parties, but because there was no card vote we will never know.\"\n\nMr Chessum said it was \"not too late for Labour to make clear that that it opposes Brexit outright\".\n\n\"Though it is not the policy we supported, the calling of a special conference to democratically decide Labour's Brexit policy was a concession which we won,\" he said. \"But a fudge is not a unity position. It is deeply divisive among members, and risks losing a large chunk of our voter base.\"\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, whose own party committed to revoking Brexit at its conference last week, said: \u201cJeremy Corbyn has again shown a total lack of leadership on Brexit and settled on yet another fudge on the biggest issue facing our country. Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly had the opportunity to put the full force of the Labour behind a Remain position, but he has once again shown today that he is a Brexiteer at heart.\"\n\nScottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon denounced the Labour vote as an \"abdication of responsibility\".\n\n\"Labour rejects a clear pro-Remain position and instead stays firmly perched on the Brexit fence,\" said Ms Sturgeon. \"It beggars belief - from a practical and principled point of view - that Corbyn thinks he can go through a General Election without saying if he backs Remain or Leave. The SNP's position is unequivocally Stop Brexit.\"\n\nLabour MP Ian Murray, a prominent campaigner for Remain, said: \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognise that we now have a policy of a public vote on any deal with the option to Remain. That\u2019s really the only show in town.\n\n\u201cBut it is of course deeply disappointing that we have not chosen to campaign for Remain at this stage, as that certainly does not reflect the strong views of the overwhelming majority of our members and supporters.\n\n\u201cIt is simply not tenable for our leadership to be neutral when we face the biggest crisis our country has witnessed in modern times.\"\n\nAnd Green MP Caroline Lucas said: \"After the climate crisis, the biggest issue we face - and Labour refuses to take a side. At a time when we need a strong opposition more than ever, they\u2019ve left the pitch. This is a tragedy for our politics and our country.\"", "description": "Labour\u2018s annual conference has\u00a0voted to reject a bid to commit the party to campaigning for Remain in any future EU referendum.
