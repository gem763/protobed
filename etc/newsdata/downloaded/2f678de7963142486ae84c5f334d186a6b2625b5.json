In gold, prices tend to bottom about every 6-months (give or take a month). The last low came in May. If the current cycle remains on course, the next significant bottom should arrive in late October or early November.\n\nGold surged as US interest rates plunged over the summer. The 10-year Treasury yield collapsed from 2.57% to 1.43% while gold rocketed from $1267 to $1566 in 4-months. With Treasury yields stabilizing, gold is finally taking a breather.\n\nIn August, Fed fund futures were pricing in a September rate cut at 100%. Those odds have slipped to 63.5% before tomorrow\u2019s announcement. A pause on interest rate cuts could send gold below the critical $1490 level.\n\nLonger-term we are very bullish on gold. Prices broke out in June and confirmed a new bull market. On a near-term basis, we are expecting a multi-week correction and perhaps the last great buying opportunity as gold declines into the next 6-month low.\n\nAfter peaking at 440 in August, our Gold Cycle Indicator (GCI) dipped back into neutral territory (currently 334). We won\u2019t expect a sustainable bottom in gold until the GCI slips below 100 in October or November.\n\nTake a look at the best Gold trading brokers for 2019\n\nAG Thorson is a registered CMT and expert in technical analysis.
