They struggled to get anywhere close to being the side that blew everyone that can their way in 1990.\n\nThey failed to make the semifinals in next two World Cups.\n\nAfter the turn of the century, Germany was reborn and revitalised.

Not only has that not happy, the once formidable force has now been reduced to mediocrity. Five years is a long time in football, and Germany are a living proof of that.\n\nAfter another last four finish at the European Championships in 2016, Germany have gone from one of the top teams to one of the undistinguished and middling sides.\n\nAfter the World Cup triumph, the next two years saw many of the established players call time on their international careers.\n\nMiroslav Klose, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Philipp Lahm, and Lukas Podolski, who formed the experienced core walked off in the sunset. Germany are yet to replace the players who were pivotal, and have paid the price as they languish at the basal.\n\nAP\n\nThe fall from the pinnacle has been drastic and monumental. The German side of old is now a sub-standard side looking for a way out of the muddle, and looking for a new identity - the old is what they will take.\n\nAfter the 2016 European Championships, the German side have lost their midas touch. When Germany go the World Cup, they are always one of the favourites.\n\nNo matter the form they come in, they always save the best for the top tournaments. In Russia, German team though had a reality check.\n\nA new squad, with a few players from the 2014 winning roster, came into the tournament looking to put up a good show, but they ended up embarrassing themselves, exiting in the group stages. It was the for the first time in 16 years, Germany failed to make the last four.\n\nAFP\n\nThey won only one game against Sweden, and lost the other two to Mexico and South Korea respectively, finishing last in the group and making a shocking yet deserving exit early in the tournament. The side was ridiculed for being meek and surrendering far too easily.\n\nIt was also unprecedented - German sides in the past were always formidable units, but the one that went to Russia lacked vigour, intensity, fight, and confidence. After the humbling experience in 2018, German have given the boot to many senior players, and have shown trust in the young players.\n\nThe new talent has come through, but they are yet to establish themselves. The likes of Serge Gnabry, Julian Brandt, Niklas S\u00fcle, Lukas Klostermann, Kai Havertz, Joshua Kimmich, and Timo Werner, have massive potential but are yet to show the caliber of players who can impact the games.\n\nAFP\n\nBut there have been positives - the young squad is beginning to take shape, there is better understanding in team's play, and they are making slow but steady gains.\n\nGermany currently sit level on points with Netherlands at top of their group in the European Championship qualifiers.\n\nAfter a massive downward slide, the once great football force Germany, is trying to reclaim its lost glory and status. There is work to do, but they have players who can go on to become world beaters.\n\nThe fallen giant is on the mend - Germany are taking the slow walk to the top, again.", "description": "Since the turn of the 21st century, Germany national football team has been one of the most exciting and successful teams on the international scene.
