Hamlin, who started on the pole and finished fourth, was not pleased by it and went after Logano. Several crew members intervened, with Hamlin eventually ending up on the ground.\n\nJoey Logano and Denny Hamlin battled hard on the track.\n\n\n\nThen, they got into each other on pit road. #NASCARPlayoffspic.twitter.com/V8cl2QSwtI \u2014 NASCAR on NBC (@NASCARonNBC) October 27, 2019\n\n\"We were having a discussion, and everything was civil. And then like Joey does, he does a little push and then runs away,\" Hamlin said.\n\n\"That's Joey. He's scared. He said, 'Do you want to go?' I said, 'Yes, I'm here.' And then he runs away.\"\n\nTake a listen to what @dennyhamlin had to say following his altercation with @joeylogano on pit road. #NASCARPlayoffspic.twitter.com/hihRxrlawr \u2014 NASCAR (@NASCAR) October 27, 2019\n\nLogano said he was angered by Hamlin's in-race move where the veteran driver ran the 2018 champ into a wall, which resulted in a cut tire.\n\n\"I just wanted to talk to him about (the on-track incident). I was pretty frustrated. He kind of came off the corner like he didn't have a car on the outside of him. It ruined our day. We had a shot at the win for sure,\" Logano said.\n\nA fight between Denny Hamlin and Joey Logano is broken up.

I just wanted to see what his thoughts were, and it wasn't quite the answer I was looking for.\"\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know what happened.\u201d @joeylogano explains his side of the story following the altercation with @dennyhamlin. #NASCARPlayoffspic.twitter.com/A8hSjKNvqP \u2014 NASCAR (@NASCAR) October 27, 2019\n\nLogano finished in eighth, while Martin Truex Jr. took the checkered with a dominant run.\n\nContributing: Ellen Horrow", "description": "Joey Logano and Denny Hamlin got into a scuffle on pit road following the NASCAR playoff race at Martinsville Speedway.", "authors": ["Jace Evans", "Published P.M.
