De Blasio\u2019s exit leaves 19 Democrats vying to be the party\u2019s nominee.\n\nThe mayor, barred from seeking a third four-year term in New York in 2021, struggled to build a national profile and stand out in a field that included former Vice President Joe Biden and a long list of experienced politicians.\n\nDe Blasio had registered little support in polls and was eclipsed by progressive U.S. senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nTrump greeted news of de Blasio ending his presidential bid with sarcasm.\n\n\u201cOh no, really big political news, perhaps the biggest story in years! Part time Mayor of New York City, @BilldeBlasio, who was polling at a solid ZERO but had tremendous room for growth, has shocking dropped out of the Presidential race,\u201d Trump, a New York real estate developer before running for president, wrote on Twitter. \u201cNYC is devastated, he\u2019s coming home!\u201d\n\nNew York City Mayor and former Democratic U.S. Presidential candidate Bill de Blasio, with his wife Chirlane McCray, speaks at a news conference after announcing that he was ending his presidential bid in New York, U.S., September 20, 2019. REUTERS/Jefferson Siegel\n\nDe Blasio, who announced the move on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d program, later gave a news conference outside the mayoral Gracie Mansion residence. He said the party\u2019s rules for qualifying for televised debates had made it hard for him to continue. He failed to qualify for a Sept. 12 debate that featured the 10 leading candidates for the party\u2019s nomination.\n\n\u201cWe were watching the polling to see if anything was moving and it just wasn\u2019t moving,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats require candidates to reach certain levels in opinion polls and fundraising to qualify for the debates, which de Blasio said had become the \u201cMain Street\u201d of the campaign.\n\n\u2018PROGRESSIVE ENERGY\u2019\n\nBiden and Warren both took to Twitter to praise de Blasio\u2019s efforts on behalf of \u201cworking families.\u201d In his news conference, de Blasio did not endorse a candidate but said \u201cthe electorate is going to push\u201d Biden, who has staked out more centrist positions than some of his rivals, in a leftward direction as the campaign continues.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much progressive energy in this party you\u2019ve probably seen him go farther on climate and healthcare than he might have on his own,\u201d the mayor said of Biden.\n\nDe Blasio emphasized during the campaign a list of liberal wins under his leadership, including universal pre-kindergarten, the end of the policing practice known as stop-and-frisk and paid sick leave, all in a city that has a bigger population, more than 8 million, than most U.S. states.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nMost New Yorkers had appeared unenthusiastic about de Blasio\u2019s presidential aspirations. A Quinnipiac University poll in April found more than three-quarters of New Yorkers did not feel he should make a White House bid.\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, which has a population just over 100,000, won more support in national polls and regularly raises money at well-attended events in New York.\n\nDe Blasio\u2019s challenges were on display at one of his final campaign appearances at a presidential forum on Monday in the town of Galivants Ferry in South Carolina. He spoke after U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, Buttigieg and Biden as the sun set, but by that point, more than half of the audience had left.", "description": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Friday ended his 2020 presidential campaign that was overshadowed by better-known liberal Democrats, and drew a sarcastic farewell from a fellow New Yorker, President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Trevor Hunnicutt", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432058273&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1RV", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
