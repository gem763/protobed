Everyone who helped build that party bears some responsibility for him. But apostate conservatives also deserve admiration for the sacrifices they\u2019re making. It must be painful to have the movement that\u2019s defined your life turn against you.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re giving up personal relationships, which are some of the most important things psychologically for any human being,\u201d said Jerry Taylor, the president of the center-right Niskanen Center, who holds regular meetings of anti-Trump Republicans. \u201cIf you spend decades of your life circulating with a certain group of friends and colleagues and associates and business partners and political allies,\u201d it\u2019s no small thing to break with them.\n\nTake George Conway, the conservative lawyer and impeachment supporter married to top Trump aide Kellyanne Conway. Obviously, I\u2019d split with my beloved husband in a second if he backed Trump. But if he worked for a lunatic whose policies I liked? I\u2019d find it a lot harder to publicly distance myself.\n\n\u201cYou have to find entirely new social networks in your life,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cThat in a sense is probably the biggest obstacle for a lot of people.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Michelle Goldberg", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Trump-Human-Scum-Tweet.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
