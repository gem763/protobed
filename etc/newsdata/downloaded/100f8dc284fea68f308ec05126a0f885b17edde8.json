These independent owners are responsible for 8 million jobs, making them the backbone of their local economies and pillars of their communities.\n\nBut the relationship between these brands we know and trust and the small business owners who make them work has for years suffered from a costly legal Catch-22 that threatens their existence \u2014 unless Congress acts.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch: federal trademark law requires franchise brands have standards to protect the brand, but federal employment law penalizes franchises for establishing the same standards.\n\nFor example, a hotel brand standard may require employees to wear branded uniforms so that every location looks the same to the public; however, those same uniforms have been used as evidence of joint employment in litigation.\n\nThis kind of uncertainty around brand control is stifling to entrepreneurs and local businesses but could be fixed with common-sense legislation. Fortunately, there\u2019s a bipartisan solution with the Trademark Licensing Protection Act (TLPA).\n\nThe TLPA simply says that brand standards aren\u2019t employment standards. The reason is simple: brand standards are responsible for the quality, consistency, safety, and uniformity that consumers expect from franchises; but they don\u2019t dictate how to achieve them.\n\nIn other words, brand standards tell you to keep the bathroom clean or the front desk staffed, but don\u2019t tell you if you need to use Clorox or Lysol to do so, how many employees are needed during certain times, or what they should be paid. Those decisions are left to the business owner, or franchisee.\n\nThat combination of guidance and independence allows franchise owners across the country the flexibility to grow their businesses, hire and train new employees, and give back to their cities and towns. Without TLPA protections, such independence is increasingly hard to maintain.\n\nDespite the common-sense solution the TLPA provides, a recent op-ed argues that the fix is harmful to workers and local business owners.\n\nRead the opposing viewpoint: Bipartisan legislation would let fast-food companies off the hook for harming workers\n\nFirst, the piece claims that recent regulations and legislative proposals weaken employees\u2019 ability to hold corporations accountable for workplace violations, but there is one glaring problem with this argument: if legal liability remains unclear, accountability will remain elusive.\n\nBy creating certainty in the law, franchise businesses will be better equipped than ever to protect their employees and reduce the legal burden of small business owners. Unlike the arguments made against TLPA, this legal burden is quantifiable: over the last years, lawsuits related to joint employer status have nearly doubled.\n\nAdditionally, nothing in the TLPA prevents a brand that does exercise employment controls over its franchisee\u2019s employees to be deemed a joint employer.\n\nMoreover \u2014 and contrary to criticism \u2014 the TLPA will help franchise brands implement stronger sexual harassment prevention programs. Under current law, brands can work with their franchisees to make new tools and resources on workplace harassment training available, but without legal clarity from the TLPA they are limited in what they can require their franchises to implement.\n\nA recent study found the uncertainty facing entrepreneurs is stymieing growth to the tune of $33.3 billion annually and 376,000 jobs not created. Without the TLPA in place, many entrepreneurs will continue to view franchising as too risky a proposition. This is a shame, since franchise ownership is often seen as the safest path to business ownership, particularly for minorities, women and veterans who have traditionally owned franchises at a higher rate than non-franchises, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThis is the kind of assistance that legal clarity for business fosters.\n\nPassing the TLPA will get franchise businesses \u2014 the brands we love and trust \u2014 on steadier footing to tackle problems that plague all kinds of businesses and organizations.\n\nBipartisan work is few and far between in Congress these days, so it is no small feat that policy makers across the political spectrum led by Sens. Angus King (I-Maine) and James Lankford (R-Oklahoma) worked to introduce the TLPA.\n\nThe legislation is bipartisan for good reason: it is a common-sense solution to a legal problem that has hindered small business owners for too long.", "description": "Legislation to clarify that the franchisors are not employers is a common-sense solution to a legal problem that has hindered small business owners for too...", "authors": ["Matt Haller"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS726_mcdona_ZG_20191004164054.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
