Revenue was below analysts' forecasts as well. Same -store sales also missed Street forecasts, with results hurt by growing competition from third party delivery services.\n\nAlibaba, JD.com, Baidu \u2013 These and other Chinese company stocks are under pressure, following reports that the White House is considering limits on Chinese stock holdings in government pension funds.\n\nHelen of Troy \u2013 The maker of personal care products reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $2.24 per share, above the consensus estimate of $1.96 a share. Revenue beat forecasts as well, and the company also raised full-year earnings and sales guidance.\n\nNio \u2013 The Chinese electric car maker delivered 4,799 vehicles during the third quarter, up 35.1% from the second quarter and toward the upper end of Nio's prior guidance.\n\nAmbarella \u2013 Ambarella is among the stocks that could be impacted by the U.S. move to blacklist Chinese artificial intelligence startups.

Oracle is seeking to step up competition with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft.\n\nBoeing \u2013 Boeing was sued by the union representing pilots at Southwest Airlines.
