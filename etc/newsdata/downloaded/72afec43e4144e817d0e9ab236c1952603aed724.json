A large portion of the \"Fortnite's\" success has been attributed to its accessibility on mobile and traditional gaming devices. Now, other shooting games like \"Call of Duty Mobile\" are starting to get in on the action by designing new games specifically for the mobile audience.\n\nThe mobile version of \"Fortnite\" launched on iOS first in April 2018, earning 22.5 million downloads and $3.3 million in revenue during its first week in Apple's App Store.

The Android version of \"Fortnite\" also launched several months after the game was released on iOS. Because \"Fortnite\" is the same across all platforms and shares online play, some players simply chose to stick with their console of choice.\n\n\"Call of Duty Mobile\" is exclusive to mobile devices and doesn't offer any cross-play with traditional video game consoles. Though the game shares some of the same content as the console releases, it's clearly designed with a free-to-play model in mind and relies on micro-transactions to generate revenue.\n\nActivision will still release \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare,\" the next entry in the core franchise, on October 18 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.", "description": "\"Call of Duty Mobile\" had a massive debut, amassing more than 100 million downloads on Android and iOS devices.", "authors": ["Kevin Webb"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9cd8c0962b0c0349481670?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
