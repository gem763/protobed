REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo\n\nBrussels prosecutors said they conducted raids on Thursday evening, without giving details. Leroy told Belga news agency police searched her home and office over the August share sale, completed about a month before her new job was announced.\n\nThe Sept. 5 announcement that KPN had hired her from Proximus, which she led since 2014, was cheered by investors and pushed up the Dutch firm\u2019s share price. But the shares slipped a day later when the probe was announced.\n\nBelgium\u2019s stock market watchdog FSMA said on Sept. 6 it was looking into Leroy\u2019s share transaction as part of a \u201cstandard procedure.\u201d The watchdog\u2019s investigation, which could lead to a fine, is separate to the police probe.\n\nLeroy, who leaves Proximus on Friday and is due to start work at KPN on Dec. 1, denies any wrongdoing.\n\nKPN spokeswoman Victorina de Boer said KPN was aware of the Belgian investigation but had no further comment. Reuters could not immediately reach Leroy.\n\nProximus, Belgium\u2019s largest telecoms company in which the state has a 53.3% stake, had no immediate comment.\n\nLeroy sold shares in Proximus, where she has been CEO, worth 285,000 euros ($315,000) at 26.26 euros on Aug. 1, her first transaction in three years. When Leroy\u2019s departure was announced on Sept. 5, Proximus shares fell by 2.5%.\n\nLeroy said it was a routine sale after Proximus reported second quarter earnings on July 31 for the quarter ended June 30. She said she had not decided at the time to leave Proximus, although she said she was in confidential talks with KPN and other potential employers.\n\nPaul Koster, director and spokesman for Dutch shareholders\u2019 rights association VEB, said the VEB believed Leroy should not begin her new appointment until the situation has been resolved, though it was impossible to say whether she did anything wrong.\n\nHe described the incident as \u201cunnecessary\u201d and said it reflected poorly on Leroy\u2019s judgment and KPN\u2019s vetting process.\n\n\u201cShe should have taken into account (selling shares) might have been too sensitive\u201d given that the talks were not publicly known, he said. For KPN \u201cit brings home the point that you need to do due diligence,\u201d even if they were eager to hire Leroy quickly. KPN\u2019s supervisory chairman had been unaware of the share sale until it emerged in the Belgian media.\n\nKPN had trumpeted Leroy\u2019s appointment, as she had been seen as a leading candidate for top jobs at bigger firms. Leroy, 54, rose through the ranks at Unilever for two decades before moving to Proximus in 2011 and becoming CEO there in 2014.\n\nWhen her new appointment was announced, KPN Chairman Duco Sickinghe said Leroy was \u201cdynamic, client-focused, and with a wealth of experience in the telecom sector\u201d.\n\nKPN has been striving to recover from years of weak sales and profit growth. In July, it said its core earnings would grow \u201cslightly\u201d for the first time in more than five years.\n\nKPN\u2019s previous CEO, Maximo Ibarra, announced his departure in June to lead Sky Italia, after just over a year on the job.\n\nBelgian labor unions had complained about Leroy\u2019s abrupt departure, saying she could take company secrets to a competitor. They also questioned the legitimacy of her August share transaction.\n\nLeroy had initially been scheduled to leave Proximus on Nov. 30. Her departure was moved to Friday after the union complaints.", "description": "Belgian police searched the home and office of Dominique Leroy, the incoming chief executive of Dutch telecom firm KPN , to investigate her sale of shares in Proximus , the company she is leaving.", "authors": ["Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431945418&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0OE", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
