Mylan's case provided fuel to the still-continuing nationwide debate over soaring drug prices.\n\n\"It is critical that public companies accurately disclose material business risks and timely disclose and account for loss contingencies that can materially affect their bottom line,\" Antonia Chion, associate director in the SEC enforcement division, said in a statement.\n\nMylan had in July announced an agreement in principle to settle with the SEC. Its shares were up 9 cents at $19.85 in late morning trading.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Susan Fenton, Dan Grebler and Tom Brown)", "description": "The SEC on Friday said Mylan kept investors in the dark when it failed to disclose or set aside money for the two-year probe by the U.S. Department of Justice, prior to announcing a $465 million settlement in October 2016.
