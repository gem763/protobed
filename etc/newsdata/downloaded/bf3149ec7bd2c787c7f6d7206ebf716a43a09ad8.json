Eighty-two percent of them have topped EPS estimates and 63% have topped revenue expectations, according to estimates from Refinitiv.\n\nAll eyes will be on Amazon as investors look for an update on AWS growth as Microsoft and Alphabet also ramp up their cloud operations.\n\nShares of the tech giant have shed 12% over the last three months as an increase in spending and looming tech regulation have pressured the company.\n\nAnalysts are expecting EPS of $4.59 and revenue of $68.8 billion, according to estimates from FactSet. That's about 20% higher than the $56.58 billion in revenue that the company reported for the same quarter a year earlier.\n\n\"We expect strong topline momentum led by 1-Day shipping initiatives, a healthy consumer spending backdrop and strong growth in AWS and advertising,\" Stifel analyst Scott Devitt wrote in a note to clients.\n\nBut the momentum doesn't come without a cost. He's anticipating the company will earn $3.35 per share for the quarter \u2014 well below consensus estimates \u2014 although his revenue prediction of $69.5 billion is ahead of the Street.\n\nVisa, Intel, 3M, Gilead, Alaska Air, American Airlines, Northrop Grumman and Twitter are among the names also reporting earnings Thursday.", "description": "Thursday is the busiest day of earnings with 45 S&P companies set to report.", "authors": ["Pippa Stevens"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105981365-1561120926627rts2iu76.jpg?v=1561121003", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
