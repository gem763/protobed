If you are hoping to live on your dividends, it's important to be more stringent with your investments than the average punter. Regular readers know we like to apply the same approach to each dividend stock, and we hope you'll find our analysis useful.\n\nWhile Robert Walters's 3.0% dividend yield is not the highest, we think its lengthy payment history is quite interesting. The company also bought back stock equivalent to around 5.6% of market capitalisation this year. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying Robert Walters for its dividend, and we'll go through these below.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Robert Walters!\n\nLSE:RWA Historical Dividend Yield, October 18th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Robert Walters paid out 30% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. This is a middling range that strikes a nice balance between paying dividends to shareholders, and retaining enough earnings to invest in future growth. Besides, if reinvestment opportunities dry up, the company has room to increase the dividend.\n\nIn addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Robert Walters's cash payout ratio last year was 16%. Cash flows are typically lumpy, but this looks like an appropriately conservative payout. It's positive to see that Robert Walters's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nWhile the above analysis focuses on dividends relative to a company's earnings, we do note Robert Walters's strong net cash position, which will let it pay larger dividends for a time, should it choose.\n\nWe update our data on Robert Walters every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Robert Walters's dividend payments. The dividend has been stable over the past 10 years, which is great. We think this could suggest some resilience to the business and its dividends. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was UK\u00a30.048 in 2009, compared to UK\u00a30.15 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 12% per year over this time.\n\nDividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. It's good to see Robert Walters has been growing its earnings per share at 43% a year over the past five years. Earnings per share have rocketed in recent times, and we like that the company is retaining more than half of its earnings to reinvest. However, always remember that very few companies can grow at double digit rates forever.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Dividend paying stocks like Robert Walters plc (LON:RWA) tend to be popular with investors, and for good reason - some...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nOcQMLtBZjZhC5XEz5M90g--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/36383e033b8c8b903709142443b4950f", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
