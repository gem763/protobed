REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes\n\nEurope\u2019s biggest bank by assets has been looking to step up cost-cutting in a gloomy business environment brought about by an escalating Sino-U.S. trade war, Britain\u2019s protracted withdrawal from the European Union, an easing monetary policy cycle, and unrest in its key Hong Kong market.\n\nHSBC is also grappling with sluggish performance in continental Europe and the United States, which interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn called \u201cnot acceptable\u201d and vowed to restructure.\n\nHSBC said it will announce its new strategy at or before its full-year earnings report early next year.\n\nFor the third quarter ended Sept. 30, HSBC reported pre-tax profit of $4.8 billion, compared with the $5.3 billion average of analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by the bank. The Hong Kong-listed stock of the London-headquartered bank fell almost 3%.\n\nThe result is HSBC\u2019s first under Quinn - formerly commercial banking head - and is widely seen by shareholders and insiders as a report card on his auditioning for the CEO role full time.\n\n\u201cOur previous plans are no longer sufficient to improve performance for these businesses, given the softer outlook for revenue growth,\u201d Quinn said of the bank\u2019s U.S. and European operations.\n\nAs a result of a \u201cmore challenging\u201d revenue outlook compared with the first half of the year, HSBC said it did not expect to meet its return on tangible equity (RoTE) target of 11% in 2020.\n\nOne of Quinn\u2019s biggest headaches is HSBC\u2019s U.S. retail banking business, which has struggled for years against much bigger domestic rivals and where it booked a loss of $189 million in the first nine months of the year.\n\nSome analysts have said the bank could look to shutter the business entirely, but Quinn dismissed the notion.\n\n\u201cYou should not read into anything I\u2019ve said that we are looking to exit the retail bank in the U.S.,\u201d he said on Monday.\n\nA veteran of the bank since 1987, Quinn, 57, has made no secret that he is keen to secure the permanent appointment of CEO from Chairman Mark Tucker, who said in August the search to replace the ousted John Flint would take six to 12 months.\n\nQuinn said the bank, which generates the bulk of its revenue and profit in Asia, said it would rebalance capital away from low-return businesses and adjust its cost base.\n\nSuch action could result in significant charges in the fourth quarter and subsequent periods, including the possible impairment of goodwill and additional restructuring charges, the bank said.\n\nHONG KONG PROTESTS\n\nThe near- to medium-term outlook for HSBC and rival Standard Chartered PLC has also been clouded by anti-government protests in Hong Kong, their single-biggest profit centre.\n\nHong Kong has fallen into recession, hit by more than five months of protests that show no sign of relenting, and is unlikely to achieve annual economic growth this year, the city\u2019s Financial Secretary said on Sunday.\n\nBankruptcy petitions presented by debtors in Hong Kong rose nearly a fifth in the September quarter to 1,945 versus the same period a year earlier, government data showed.\n\nHSBC said its expected credit losses - including a \u201ccharge to reflect the economic outlook in Hong Kong\u201d - increased by $400 million in the third quarter. Revenue for the first nine months of the year in Hong Kong, however, rose 7%.\n\n\u201cObviously the economy is getting impacted by two things - the U.S.-China trade dispute and the protests,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson, referring to HSBC\u2019s business in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cThe part of the credit portfolio that we are most focused on is smaller end of the SMEs (small-to-mid-sized enterprises). It\u2019s difficult to predict coming quarters because in part it depends very much on those two things and when we will see resolution on either.\u201d", "description": "HSBC Holdings PLC on Monday flagged a softer revenue growth outlook and additional restructuring charges, leading it to drop a key profit target for next year after posting a more-than-expected 18% drop in quarterly pre-tax profit.", "authors": ["Sumeet Chatterjee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445750182&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R06O", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
