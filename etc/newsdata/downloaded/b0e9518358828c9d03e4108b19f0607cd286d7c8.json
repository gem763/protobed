We\u2019re allowed to say what we want to say, and we\u2019re allowed to speak up about injustices, and that\u2019s just how it goes. And if people don\u2019t understand that, that\u2019s something they have to deal with.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Neal called the conflict was \u201cunfortunate for both parties,\u201d but that \u201cDaryl Morey was right.\u201d\n\nThe NBA has been steeped in controversy after Mr. Morey inadvertently created an international conflict when he tweeted a picture calling his followers to \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nMr. Morey deleted and apologized for the tweet, but it led China\u2019s state broadcaster to cancel plans to show a pair of preseason games in that country and even asked the NBA to fire Mr. Morey, which China denies. Chinese NBA stores also pulled Rockets\u2019 merchandise from their shelves.\n\nThe NBA originally said the tweet was \u201cregrettable,\u201d but NBA Commissioner Adam Silver supported Mr. Morey and his right to freedom of speech, leading to the feud to continue nearly a month later.\n\nMr. O\u2019Neal said he would not be threatened by silence or financial attacks for his support of freedom.\n\n\u201cWhenever you see something wrong going on anywhere in the world, you should have the right to say that\u2019s not right, and that\u2019s what he did,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neal said. \u201cWhen it comes to business sometimes, you have to tiptoe around things, but again, they understand our values and we understand our values and here, we have the right to speak.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Neal\u2019s statement comes to some as a bit of a shock, as he has had a beneficial relationship with China for years.\n\nHe signed in 2006 with Chinese sportswear brand LiNing Company while with the Miami Heat and shortly thereafter received a 50-foot statue of himself erected in a Beijing city park.\n\nWith China generating an estimated 10% of the NBA\u2019s revenue and is projected to increase over time, according to CNN, not every star player has supported Mr. Morey\u2019s statement.\n\nLakers\u2019 star player, LeBron James, criticized Mr. Morey\u2019s comments on China as not being \u201ceducated.\u201d\n\nHis comments were met immediately with backlash on social media from critics who accused him of kowtowing to China and led protesters in Hong Kong to burn his jerseys as protests in Hong Kong get increasingly more violent.\n\n\u2022 Valerie Richardson contributed to this article.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
