(Oct. 11) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump, facing bipartisan condemnation over Turkey's invasion of Syria, defended his handling of the matter Wednesday as \"strategically brilliant\" and downplayed the U.S. alliance with the Kurds, whom he repeatedly described as \"not angels.\"\n\n\"It's not our problem,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo prepared to travel to Turkey to try to negotiate a ceasefire and avoid a humanitarian crisis on the Syrian border.\n\nIn remarks throughout the day,Trump dismissed mounting criticism from Capitol Hill and allies while questioningthe Kurds, many of whom fought alongside U.S. troops against ISIS.The House overwhelmingly backed a resolution condemning Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, a move that cleared the way for Turkey's invasion.\n\nDemocratic leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, stormed out of an afternoon meeting at the White House on Syria claiming the president does not have a plan contain ISIS. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham described the move as \"baffling, but not surprising.\"\n\nDuring an earlier East Room press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella, Trump welcomed reports that Russian troops had entered regions once occupied by a small number of U.S. special forces \u2013 a stance that ran counter to the views of many lawmakers who expressed concern about Russia's involvement.\n\n\"Frankly, if Russia is going to help the Kurds that\u2019s a good thing,\" Trump said.\n\n'Not angels'\n\nIn this Oct. 7, 2019, file photo, Turkish-backed forces from the Free Syrian Army stand in formation during preparations for an incursion targeting Syrian Kurdish fighters, near Azaz town, north Syria. (Photo: AP)\n\nThe president's latest remarks came days after he appeared to diminish the U.S.-Kurd alliance by saying the group is \"fighting for their land\" and noting thatthe Kurds had not fought with Allied powers in World War II. Trump said one group of Kurds, the Kurdistan Workers' Party, was \"more of a terrorist threat\" than ISIS.\n\n\"They're not angels,\" Trump said Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. considers the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or the PKK, a terrorist organization. The U.S. allied with what Turkey has described as an offshoot of that group, the People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG, to fight ISIS in Syria.\n\nAlliance: Trump downplays ties to Kurds: 'They didn't help us in the Second World War'\n\nHouse action: House will vote on resolution condemning Trump over Syria, Turkey\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of sand over there,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\u201d\n\nThe president has repeatedly framed his decision in Syria as part of his broader pledge to withdraw U.S. troops from foreign entanglements.\n\nBut U.S. troops remained in Syria on Wednesday despite Trump\u2019s statement that they\u2019d been withdrawn, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly. The military continues to close outposts in Syria housing U.S. commandos, the official said. The military has concerns for their safety because militias supported by Turkey are viewed as a potential threat in Syria to American troops, who are being evacuated by aircraft and convoys.\n\nIt's not clear how many of the 1,000 service members Trump intends to withdraw from Syria will return to the United States versus being redeployed to other countries in the region.\n\nGraham on Trump: 'Outrageously dangerous'\n\nSen.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has been a close Trump ally on many issues but critical of the president's Middle East policy.\n\n\"What the president said today is just outrageously dangerous,\u201d Graham said. \"It undercuts Pence and Pompeo. And I don\u2019t agree with his construct that Turkey's invasion of Syria is of no concern.\"\n\nTrump blasted Graham during his press conference, noting the South Carolinian's long-held hawkish foreign policy.\n\n\"Lindsey Graham would like to stay in the Middle East for the next 1,000 years,\" Trump said, before suggesting that voters in South Carolina would prefer if their senior senator focused on other issues, such as getting judges confirmed.\n\nGraham quickly fired back.\n\n\"With all due respect for the president, I think I'm elected to have a say about our national security that in my view, what is unfolding in Syria is going to be a disaster,\u201d he told reporters on Capitol Hill. \"I think this is the biggest mistake of his presidency, and I will not ever be quiet.\"\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the fighting in the region has created a power vacuum that U.S. geopolitical foes are beginning to exploit.\n\n\"This is opening things up to the Russians. They\u2019re literally where we deserted, in our camps,\u201d McCaul said. \"It's an opening for Iran, it's an opening to reinvigorate ISIS.\u2026I think the Russians and Iran are going to take over that country.\"\n\nThey weren't alone.\n\nMore than 90 House Republicans on Wednesday introduced legislation that would require the president to impose far-reaching sanctions on Turkey. The legislation, led by Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., seeks to ban U.S. military transactions with Turkey and would also slap economic penalties on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other high-ranking members of his government.\n\nThe House, meanwhile, voted 354-60 on Wednesday to approve a rare bipartisan rebuke of Trump's handling of the situation. Two-thirds of the Republicans joined with the Democrats to support the measure.\n\nEndeavoring to get ahead of congressional action, Trump announced additional sanctions on Turkey on Monday, though critics have said those are less significant than the economic punishments lawmakers are now considering.\n\nThe Obama administration entered its alliance with the Kurds hesitantly, and faced criticism at the time for doing so. Graham, recently back from a trip to Turkey in 2016, described aligning with the Kurds as \"the dumbest idea in the world.\"\n\n\"I just got back from Turkey. They\u2019re not OK with this,\" he told then Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Gen. Joseph Dunford. \"They think this is the dumbest idea in the world and I agree with them.\"\n\nSince then, U.S. and Kurdish forces captured the territory ISIS held in Syria, and Trump has has frequently held up maps to tout the progress made in that effort. Some critics argue abandoning the Kurds after that effort sends the wrong message to other allies.\n\nPence and Pompeo are set to travel to Turkey to meet with Erdogan to try to negotiate a ceasefire. Erdogan initially indicated he wouldn\u2019t meet with the U.S. delegation but now has expressed a willingness to do so.\n\nStabilizing force in Syria\n\nDuring his news conference, Trump rejected criticism that he gave Erdogan a \"green light\" to invade northern Syria, telling a reporter who pressed him on the point that the question is \"deceptive.\"\n\n\"I didn't give him a green light,\" said Trump, who noted Turkey has long sought to push back Kurds on the border they view as a threat. \"Just the opposite of a green light.\"\n\nBut critics say the small number of U.S. forces in the region acted as a deterrent to Turkey's incursion. Agreeing to pull them back, those critics say, amounted to approval.\n\nAnalysts have said the U.S. presence in northern Syria had stabilized the area, and made military conflict more likely; the post-withdrawal influx of Turkish and Russian troops makes it more dangerous.\n\nMark Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, described the president's remarks as \"yet another ignominious moment in Trump\u2019s treatment of American allies.\"\n\nBut, Dubowitz said, this one is \"particularly egregious given that the Kurds lost 11,000 men and women fighting ISIS and helping save American lives.\"\n\nAnti-Trump Republican strategist Rick Tyler agreed.\n\n\"Well, I hope they weren't angels, they were killing our enemies,\" Tyler said. \"Trump has shown the world that he is a weak, easily manipulated, corrupt and disloyal. We will pay in treasure and blood tomorrow for his misguided ill-informed decisions today.\"\n\nContributing: Tom Vanden Brook, Christal Hayes and Maureen Groppe\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during an event on \"transparency in Federal guidance and enforcement\" in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2019, (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/16/trump-turkeys-syria-invasion-not-our-problem-kurds-not-angels/3975582002/", "description": "Donald Trump dismissed U.S.-allied Kurds as \"not angels\" as he scrambled\u00a0to respond to global condemnation over the Turkey-Syria conflict.", "authors": ["John Fritze", "David Jackson", "Deirdre Shesgreen", "Courtney Subramanian", "Published A.M.
