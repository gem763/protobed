It sold for dollar-per-sq m rate that was similar to what the aged care facility paid for their entire site only a few years prior. So in that sense it was a fair price; in a residential sense, it was a fantastic sale. They\u2019d paid $9 million for 15 Cornell Street, so the price per sq m was very similar.\n\nWe all know neighbours are famous for not getting along. Sometimes you need a third party to come in and agitate a little bit. \u2014 Agent Greg Bowring\n\nWhat did you think it would go for? Something in the high $1 millions would have done it. But $1.9 million was the figure at the end of the day. The aged care facility was approached by the owners of 13 Cornell who floated the idea of selling directly to them. The aged care facility showed a little interest but negotiations fell apart shortly thereafter. There was a stalemate at $1.8 million. I negotiated an extra $100,000, which they were happy with.\n\nWhat was surprising about it?\n\nYears ago they had an argument about a footpath that encumbered their system. There was a handrail and footpath built on the title of the property I sold \u2013 Number 13 \u2013 but which was utilised by the aged care facility. That was an agreement done many years ago.\n\nWe all know neighbours are famous for not getting along. Both stood firm. Sometimes you need a third party to come in and agitate a little bit.\n\nDuring the leaner months, we do letterbox drops to generate business. That negotiation broke down about a month before we did our - perfectly timed - letterbox drop. They called us up.\n\nWe structured our fee that if it was sold for less than $1.8 million, we would only charge an admin fee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a bit of a compromised facility [due to the encumbrances on the site]. It wouldn\u2019t be an easy sale for a traditional home buyer. The aged care facility was always going to be the ultimate buyer.\n\nWe were putting up a sign for one buyer. \u2014 Greg Bowring\n\nReal estate sells well when there\u2019s competition. When you\u2019ve only got one buyer and the house selling is a secret that this one buyer knows and no-one else knows about, greed comes in to a certain degree.\n\nWe set a plan in place. \u201cThe neighbour wants the site, so let\u2019s lift the bar up. Let\u2019s put up a sign saying \u2018We\u2019re on the market. Should you want to negotiate, feel free to call\u2019.\u201d We were putting up a sign for one buyer.\n\nOn Day One the for-sale board was erected. It was just to let the buyer know next door that the vendors were intent on moving one way or another and they potentially weren\u2019t the only buyer in the marketplace that may be interested in that property. On Day Two all local builders and developers and neighbours were notified of the upcoming potential sale/auction, including a competing agent who was selling a few doors down.\n\nOn Day 3 after the board was erected, I had a call from one of the aged care facility directors, a very friendly chap. He invited me into his office at PwC in the city. On Day Four we met. I was very transparent with him and said the family\u2019s wish and instruction was for me to explore the marketplace before we went live with a proper advertising campaign. That goes with any campaign. We do two to three weeks off-market. It\u2019s that fear of loss, a bit of FOMO comes into it.\n\nOn Day Five, we [received] offer of 1.83m from the aged care facility. That was $30,000 above what the vendor had [been offered] prior by going privately to them. It was a step in the right direction. There was [also] a gentleman who flanked our eastern side of the block doing a townhouse subdivision. He showed a little bit of interest.\n\nThrough negotiation in the next day or so we had $1.9 million written up. The builder was well and truly out at that level. On Day Six we sold for $1.9 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat will the aged care facility do with the site?\n\nAs far as I\u2019m aware they will be talking to council about maybe placing some admin in there. Down the track, it neighbours the driveway to the aged care facility, so whether they expand that and redevelop\u2026.\n\nDo you reckon we\u2019ll see another result like this: a) next week b) next year c) next cycle d) never?\n\na) We\u2019ll most likely see one next week. These transactions happen more often than you\u2019d think. Being on the market can be quite an anxiety-producing process for a lot of people selling. They like to avoid it. They like an easy way out. If you\u2019ve got a buyer that has interest in a property, then you can usually get a fair deal done quite quickly.", "description": "There was only ever one buyer for this home, but the agent's successful aim was to give them a sense of FOMO.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2627%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_42/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e1268781c24f9237b7a600ce814dc179fa790293", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
