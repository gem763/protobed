It helped stem cells detach from bone marrow in just two hours\n\nOnly one in about 430 registry members on Be The Match actually end up donating. Many can't due to genetic blood disorders.\n\n'Our approach could significantly increase the number of patients who could benefit from bone marrow transplants,' said senior author Dr Camilla Forsberg, a professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz.\n\n'Even though there are already ways to do this, the standard regimen doesn't work for everyone.'\n\nBone marrow is the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made.\n\nTransplants involve taking a donor's healthy blood-forming cells (called hematopoietic stem cells) and putting them into the patient's bloodstream.\n\nFrom there, the stem cells begin to grow and make healthy red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.\n\nCurrently, patients are given injection of Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCSF), which stimulates the bone marrow to produce stem cells and release them into the bloodstream.\n\nAfter four to six days of injections, the stems cells are collected.\n\nHowever, this regimen often causes side effects, such as bone pain, in those who need bone marrow transplants.\n\nFor example, GCSF worsens the symptoms of patients with sickle-cell disease, which causes red blood cells to become misshapen and break down.\n\n'If we can make bone marrow transplants a super safe procedure, there are a lot of other disorders for which it could be life-changing, especially for children,' Dr Forsberg said.\n\n'Doctors could provide a one-time treatment for conditions that currently have to be managed over a patient's lifetime.'\n\nFor the study, published in Stem Cell Reports, the team gave mice one dose of Viagra, which helps widen blood vessels.\n\nThe mice were then given Plerixafor, which prevents the stem cells from sticking to the bone marrow, allowing scientists to collect them.\n\n'When you dilate the blood vessels with Viagra, the cells mobilized by Plerixafor are better able to get out into the blood stream,' said first author Stephanie Smith-Berdan, a research specialist in Dr Forsberg's laboratory.", "description": "A new study from the University of California Santa Cruz gave mice a dose of Viagra followed by an injection of another drug.
