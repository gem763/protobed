Check it out!\n\nChronicle Collectibles Sixth-Scale Jurassic Park Dr. Grant and Velociraptor Bundle\n\nProving Hot Toys isn\u2019t the only company making 30cm drool-worthy figures, Chronicle Collectibles is rewarding long time Jurassic Park fans with miniature versions of one of Hollywood\u2019s most dynamic duos: Dr. Alan Grant and a velociraptor. The diminutive Sam Neill includes over 30 points of articulation, swappable heads with and without a hat, and interchangeable hands. The 64cm long velociraptor only includes 12 points of articulation, but swappable hands displaying varying levels of menace. The pair will set you back $US625 ($922) with a minimum of $US159 ($235) to cart it to Australia and they\u2019re not expected to ship until late 2020 at the earliest.\n\nBandai Warhammer 40,000 Primaris Intercessor Space Marine\n\nGames Workshop\u2019s sci-fi Warhammer universe has made huge leaps and bounds beyond its usual confines of tabletop gaming in recent years, from comics to TV shows to video games and more all being made in the bonkers grim setting. But now, for the first time, its most beloved faction \u2014 the Space Marines \u2014 are being transformed from intricate little plastic model kits to a full on, 8\" tall action figure from Bandai, the first ever action figure from the 40K setting.\n\nAside from all the articulation you\u2019d expect from one of Bandai\u2019s action figure lines, the Primaris Space Marine (clad in the iconic blue and gold colour scheme of the Ultramarines Chapter) comes with his giant Boltgun to purge the enemies of mankind\u2019s interstellar Imperium with, a combat blade, and a set of alternate hands to pose the figure with closed fists or gripping its weapons. Alas, no chainsword, but as a first crack at a figure in this universe, we\u2019ll take what we can get. Just 9000 of the Primaris Intercessor are being made for now \u2014 and if you want one, you\u2019ll have to put aside 210 and preorder directly from Games Workshop before November 2.\n\nS.H. Figuarts Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man Anti-Ock Suit\n\nBandai\u2019s excellent line of Figuarts Marvel toys makes a brief return to the world of the Playstation 4 Spidey game with a new figure based on one of the original suits made just for Insomniac\u2019s excellent open world action adventure epic. As the name implies, Peter builds this black-and-golden suit in the game\u2019s climax to go toe-to-toe with none other than Doctor Octopus himself, Otto Octavius.\n\nAside from looking rad as all hell, the figure comes with alternate eye pieces to pose Peter squinting at his multi-limbed foe, alternate hands for thwipping and webcrawling, and a set of webs to pose him swinging into action. A web exclusive in Japan \u2014 meaning it\u2019ll be harder to get on these more distant spider-shores \u2014 the Anti-Ock Spider-Man will cost roughly $135.99 with pre-orders already open, ahead of the December 2019 release. [Sugo Toys]\n\nMarvel Thor\u2019s Mj\u00f6lnir Hammer Oversized Foam Prop Replica\n\nIf you\u2019re asking yourself what you could possibly do with an oversized foam replica of Thor\u2019s Mj\u00f6lnir Hammer, you should instead be asking what can\u2019t you do with a four-foot-tall replica of an iconic weapon that can only be wielded by those who are worthy. In addition to utterly destroying pi\u00f1atas with a single mighty swing, this is a great tool for pushing your way through crowds, and utterly dominating a game of Whac-A-Mole. And if you happen to be heading out on Halloween dressed as a gigantic version of Thor, you\u2019re now just $158 away from completing your costume.", "description": "Welcome back to Toy Aisle, io9's regular roundup of all things good and plastic on the internet lately.
