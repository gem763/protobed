I could list stuff like BGS or even M .. but we'll stay away from the wild 10%+ ones. :D\n\nMy two larger positions are MO and OXY - and nothing about them is normal - mergers and fights and leverage. Runner ups are DOW and F, but they are not quite there yet.. and to be honest I'd prefer F over DOW. I also have a position in BTI.. because I think any bounce in the GBP is good for that.. and just plain curiosity...
