Six people, including Kreimeyer and the expectant mother, gathered Saturday and put gunpowder inside a homemade stand that was welded to a metal base.\n\nRelated Video: Explosion Destroys Iowa House, Damages Others\n\nIs this the 'new normal'?

The stand had a hole drilled in the side for a fuse.\n\nFinally, tape was wrapped over the top of the assembly. The idea was for the gunpowder to blast the colored powder indicating the gender out the top of the stand.\n\nBut the explosion instead sent metal shrapnel flying. Kreimeyer \u2013 who was standing with family members about 45 feet away \u2013 was killed instantly by a piece that struck her in the head, the news release said. The debris continued flying for well over 100 more yards, the sheriff's office said.\n\nSandholdt also released a statement: \"This family got together for what they thought was going to be a happy event with no intent for anyone to get hurt. What ended up happening was that Pamela Kreimeyer, a wife, mother and grandmother, was killed by a piece of metal where a metal stand, gunpowder and colored powder were involved. This is a reminder that anytime someone mixes these things there is a high potential for serious injury or death; please do not take these unnecessary risks. My condolences go out to the family.\"\n\nFollow Philip Joens on Twitter @Philip_Joens.\n\nElijah Cummings: Why a pallbearer at Cummings' memorial didn't shake Mitch McConnell's hand\n\nThis article originally appeared on Des Moines Register: Pamela Kreimeyer: Woman killed in gender reveal explosion identified", "description": "Family members were looking for ways to make a fun announcement of a child's gender, but inadvertently created a pipe bomb.", "authors": ["Philip Joens", "Des Moines Register"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hk6GpSGFmnT5oaTslEEwMw--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/cf856650-f9af-11e9-bfff-d40237730200", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
