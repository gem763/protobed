However in the clip Trump doesn't kill her himself, a character portrayed as CNN does.\n\n'The left, right & center left me hanging out to dry regarding the Trump mask photo. Please don\u2019t let it happen again. No, this video isn\u2019t a joke to his followers. And it will not be taken as such,' she added.\n\nComedian Kathy Griffin has slapped the Trumpsman parody video that shows him on a killing spree, murdering his rivals and news organizations. In the disturbing clip she's beheaded with an axe\n\nThe parody uses her likeness from her infamous 2017 photo holding what's supposed to be Donald Trump's bloody severed head\n\nShe slammed the clip on Sunday saying 'I'm depicted as being murdered by the President of the United States in this video. Please don\u2019t let it happen again.

I never broke the law, or violated the 1A. I\u2019ll be watching to see if anyone has the balls this to advocate for me this time...publicly. Hello???'

Trump's head is superimposed on the body of the film's star, Colin Firth, who goes on to kill the parishioners who are depicted as media entities\n\nThe graphic clip shows Trump shooting and stabbing the parishioners as well as prominent Democrats and media personalities\n\n'Re: the video played over the weekend: The @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has not yet seen the video, he will see it shortly, but based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video,' White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham tweeted on Monday morning.\n\nThe president, who was active on Twitter Monday morning, has not yet personally addressed the video.\n\nSeveral news organizations and the White House Correspondents Association called on the president to disavow the video after its existence was revealed Sunday night.\n\n'The images depicted are vile and horrific,' CNN, one of the news organizations depicted, said Sunday night in a statement.\n\nThe event at Trump's resort in Miami was attended by former White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders (left); Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (center); and the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr (right)\n\nA spokesperson for Trump's re-election campaign says the campaign had nothing to do with the clip. The Trump National Doral Miami is seen in the above stock image\n\n'The president and his family, the White House, and the Trump campaign need to denounce it immediately in the strongest possible terms. Anything less equates to a tacit endorsement of violence and should not be tolerated by anyone.'\n\nSanders and an individual close to Don Jr told the Times that they did not see the video in question.\n\n'I was there to speak at a prayer breakfast, where I spoke about unity and bringing the country together,' Sanders told the Times.\n\n'I wasn't aware of any video, nor do I support violence of any kind against anyone.'\n\nDeSantis has yet to comment on the matter.", "description": "Comedian Kathy Griffin has slammed the Trumpsman parody video that shows him on a killing spree and depicts her getting beheaded by CNN.", "authors": ["Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/18/19704322-0-image-a-49_1571075166931.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
