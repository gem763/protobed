These goods can be placed on auction for sale.\n\nThe warrant of execution will first be issued against the defaulter\u2019s movable property and to the extent that same is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding debt, she says, it will be issued against their immovable property, as well as incorporeal property such as policies, bank accounts and investments.\n\nShould the goods sold in execution in terms of the warrant of execution be insufficient to satisfy a debt, a party in whose favour a maintenance order has been granted may make application for a garnishee order against the defaulter\u2019s salary.\n\nGarnishee order\n\nThe result of a garnishee order will be that the garnishee is ordered as against the defaulter\u2019s employer, Shardlow explains, and the defaulter\u2019s employer will be ordered to discharge the defaulter\u2019s indebtedness on a monthly basis.\n\nThis is by means of paying over a stipulated amount in satisfaction of the outstanding debt to the complainant\u2019s from the defaulter\u2019s salary and the defaulter shall only receive the balance of his salary once that amount has been paid to the other parent.\n\nIt must be noted that failure to pay maintenance in accordance with a maintenance order is a criminal offence, she says.\n\nIf it can be shown that the defaulter is in \"wilful default\" the complainant may approach a court stating that the defaulter is in contempt of the court order and the defaulter may be liable to a fine and/or criminal sanctions inclusive of imprisonment.\n\nMaintenance dodgers\n\nIt's no secret that some parents dodge their obligations, but it's important to know that the law protects kids first and foremost.\n\nParent's who have been left high and dry must be sure to follow up at the courts and not give up.\n\nFor more on how contentious maintenance issues can become, read: Maintenance money: to some, more divisive than divorce\n\nChat back:\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your mail.
