Fountain, which has built a platform to find and screen candidates for field roles \u2014 not knowledge-worker desk jobs, but hourly work that likely has you on your feet \u2014 has raised $23 million, money that it will be using to continue expanding its platform, the kinds of services it provides to its customers and its geographical footprint.\n\nFountain already has some scale: The company currently sources and processes more than 1 million inbound candidate applications each month, filling some 150,000 jobs in the process, CEO and founder Keith Ryu said in an interview.\n\nIn addition to building engines to source candidates through a number of channels, such as traditional job boards, social media channels, a company\u2019s own site and more, Fountain then helps with screening, interview scheduling, background checks (using third-party providers for this part), communicating with the candidate, handling the paperwork and, finally, onboarding.\n\nLed by DCM, this latest round also included a potentially strategic backer, the Chinese recruitment site 51job, as well as Origin Ventures, Uncork Capital and others that are not being named. This brings the total raised by Fountain, which previously was called OnboardIQ and had been incubated in Y Combinator, to $34 million.\n\nFountain\u2019s business targets two main kinds of employers. First, ridesharing companies like Uber, delivery startups like Postmates and home services providers like Thumbtack all function by virtue of their pools of \u201cgig\u201d workers, self-employed people who choose their own working hours and dip into the platforms for assignments when they have time to fulfill them.\n\nBut the challenge of finding good people for field jobs is not venture-backed startups\u2019 alone. The second big category that Fountain taps for business is the wider pool of retail and food industry businesses that have long relied on hourly workers but also find it hard to source qualified and reliable people.\n\nBetween those two, Ryu said that customers cover big \u201cgig economy\u201d businesses like Uber Eats, Caviar and Cabify; large fast food franchises, including Taco Bell, Burger King and KFC chains; and a number of other customers that use Fountain\u2019s APIs for white-label services and prefer not to be named. (I think it\u2019s interesting that Uber Eats is on Fountain\u2019s customer list, but Uber is not.)\n\nFountain was founded in 2015, arguably at the peak of demand for recruiting gig economy workers. In the years since then, and especially in recent times, demands have moved away for these companies from aggressive expansion (bringing on, for example, lots of new drivers), and into more profitable operations. Ryu said that the knock-on effect for Fountain has not been a reduction, but a change, in terms of the services required, with some companies opting to outsource, whereas in the past they might have handled recruitment in-house.\n\n\u201cThere has been some attention to reducing operating costs per driver, including driver acquisition,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is where we have been getting involved, using our size [and reach] to reduce the cost to the employer.\u201d\n\nThis also has had the effect of also seeing Fountain change up its own strategy to make more of an effort to target more traditional businesses that are based around hourly employees: no longer contractors, but still very much in the field.\n\n\u201cAs the unrivaled leader in gig hiring and recruiting, Fountain is already reshaping the way billions of job seekers interact with employers,\u201d says David Chao, co-founder and partner at DCM, in a statement. \u201cFountain has been exceptionally capital efficient and has best-in-class customer retention,\u201d adds Kyle Lui, partner at DCM.\n\nFountain is not disclosing its valuation with this round. In its last round, back in 2017, it had a very modest $40 million price on it, although given its growth since then (it had sourced 5 million candidates in two years in 2017; now it sources 1 million each month) this is likely to be significantly higher.", "description": "Contract, self-employed and temporary jobs are on the rise in developed markets, with some 85% of the global workforce, 2.7 billion people, estimated to be on some form of hourly wage rather than flat salary.
