That is why I am not surprised at all what he does.\n\n\u201cWhen he is 50 years old he will be at home and FIFA will invite him to a game of legends. He will play the game and score a goal. I am sure it will be like that.\u201d", "description": "Jose Mourinho has hailed Cristiano Ronaldo after his compatriot scored four goals against Lithuania for Portugal in Euro 2020 qualifying.
