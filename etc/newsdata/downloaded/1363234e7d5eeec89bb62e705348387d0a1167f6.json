I believe this vivid character would bring international attention and concern,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nLater that day an 18-year-old demonstrator was shot in the chest as he and a group attacked police officers.\n\nThe incident, which police have said was justified, has sparked more protester fury.\n\nAt a sit-in outside the teenager\u2019s school on Wednesday, a person delivered a statement condemning police \u2014 hiding his face behind a Guy Fawkes mask.\n\nHours later, protesters held a \u201cCitizen\u2019s Press Conference\u201d in the same district. Two speakers were wearing the masks.", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 As Hong Kong raged with the worst political violence so far this summer, many of those hitting the streets adopted a new", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
