David Berger turned heads when his Commandant\u2019s Planning Guidance said \u201cthe global options for amphibs include many more options than simply LHAs, LPDs and LSDs\u201d and that, on account of a growing anti-access/area-denial threat environment, \u201cvisions of a massed naval armada nine nautical miles off-shore in the South China Sea preparing to launch the landing force in swarms of ACVs, LCUs and LCACs are impractical and unreasonable.\u201d\n\nLHA, LPD and LSD are Navy designations for large, armored amphibious assault ships that can displace up to 40,000 tons of water and carry hundreds of Marines plus aircraft, LCAC hovercraft, LCU landing craft and ACV amphibious vehicles. A single large amphib can cost more than a billion dollars.\n\n\u201cSince the document was released in July [2019], those in the military and industry have speculated what that could mean,\u201d Eckstein added.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps are considering acquiring small transport ships in order to complement existing large amphibious vessels and give the fleet more ways of landing troops during a major war.", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9L1Yrt0O4A_M29C1YGCuyg--~B/aD05OTI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/1def81233a476630a35263ec19240977", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
