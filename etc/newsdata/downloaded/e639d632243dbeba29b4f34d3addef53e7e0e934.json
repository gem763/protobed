The UN has described the situation in the country as the world's worst humanitarian crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, another 50 million children around the world are afflicted by wasting, a chronic and debilitating thinness also resulting from poverty.\n\nAt the same time, half of youngsters across the globe under five are not getting essential vitamins and minerals, a long-standing problem UNICEF has dubbed \"hidden hunger.\"\n\nOver the last three decades, however, another form of child malnutrition has surged across the developing world: excess weight.\n\nIn war-torn Yemen, 46 percent of all pre-school children faced stunting according to data from 2013 to 2018 [File: Yahya Arhab/EPA]\n\n\"This triple burden - undernutrition, a lack of crucial micronutrients, obesity - is increasingly found in the same country, sometimes in the same neighbourhood, and often in the same household,\" Victor Aguayo, head of UNICEF's nutrition programme, told AFP.\n\n\"A mother who is overweight or obese can have children who are stunted or wasted.\"\n\nAcross all age groups, more than 800 million people in the world are constantly hungry and another two billion are eating too much of the wrong foods, driving epidemics of obesity, heart disease and diabetes.\n\nIn contrast, the report said that Japan has the lowest rates of infant mortality, while the rate of obesity of children five to 19 is 14.42 percent, which is among the lowest in developed countries.\n\nExperts credit Japan's school lunches programme and overall healthy diet for its high scores in nutrition.\n\n'Hidden hunger'\n\nAmong children under five, diet during the first 1,000 days after conception is the foundation for physical health and mental development, the report said.\n\nOnly two-in-five babies are exclusively breastfed for their first six months, as recommended by global health guidelines.\n\nSales of milk-based bottle formulas have risen worldwide by 40 percent, and in upper middle-income countries such as Brazil, China and Turkey by nearly three-quarters.\n\nMissing vitamins and minerals, meanwhile, can lead to compromised immune systems, poor sight and hearing defects.\n\nA lack of iron can cause anaemia and reduced IQ.\n\n\"It's 'hidden' because you don't notice the impact until it is too late,\" Brian Keeley, editor-in-chief of the report, told the AFP news agency.\n\nThe rise of obesity, however, is plain to see.\n\nThe problem was virtually non-existent in poor countries 30 years ago, but today at least 10 percent of under fives are overweight or obese in three-quarters of low-income nations.\n\nThe report said that the US tops the percentage of obesity of children from five to 19 [File: Michael Reynolds/EPA]\n\n\"There needs to be a focus on obesity before it is too late,\" said Keeley. \"Unless you deal with it in a preventative way, you're going to struggle to fix it later on.\"\n\nUNICEF said that the United States tops the percentage of obesity of children aged five to 19 with 41.86 percent, with Italy at 36.87 percent and France at 30.09 percent. Japan has the lowest rate in that category at 14.42 percent.\n\nClimate change factor\n\nProgress in fighting undernourishment will also be hampered by climate change, the report warned.\n\nA single degree Celsius of warming since the late-19th century has amplified droughts responsible for more than 80 percent of damage and losses in agriculture.\n\nThe Earth's average surface temperature is set to rise another two or three degrees by 2100.\n\nResearch by scientists at Harvard University, meanwhile, has shown that the increased concentration of CO2 in the air is sapping staple food crops of essential nutrients and vitamins, including zinc, iron and vitamin B.\n\n\"The impacts of climate change are completely transforming the food that is available and that can be consumed,\" Aguayo said.\n\nMaking sure every child has access to a healthy diet must become a \"political priority\" if widespread malnutrition is to be conquered, especially in developing countries, the report said.", "description": "Report finds 149 million children four or younger are stunted and malnutrition costs the world $3.5 trillion yearly.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/15/4ec0711ec3af49b8a716c63d329341a8_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
