Last time I met him he was a boy, along with Prince Harry and they came with their mother to my ex-mother in law's house.'\n\n'I was telling Prince William that I was in the outbacks \u2013 my constituency, which is Mianwali-I, is really considered an outback and it's really quite wild there.\n\n'I was touring my constituency when I heard of the accident and I can tell you that the impact it had on the people shocked me.\n\nSpeaking to CNN's Max Foster, Mr Khan said he told the Duke of Cambridge that Diana's death sent shock waves through even the most rural parts of the nation\n\n'I mean, these were rural peasants. I wouldn't have even thought they would have heard of Princess Di.\n\n'But when they heard of accident and her death. It was just\u2026 I was amazed at how Princess Diana had penetrated, even in these rural constituencies.'\n\nWhen asked how Prince William responded to this, he replied: 'I think it was important for him to know how much she was loved in this country.'\n\nThe chairman of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf political party also spoke about his ambition to be Prime Minister, an aim he told the Prince about on their first meeting.\n\nHe said: 'I'd just started my political party. It's 23 years since I started my political movement and I assumed that it would be very easy, here's my party and I would go out and people would vote for me! Little did I realise what I would go through to get here!'\n\n'I mean, God, it's a lifetime, the struggle of becoming a Prime Minister in a country, where unfortunately I had to fight two mafias.\n\nThe royal couple met Mr Khan in Islamabad on their first full day of engagements in the country on Tuesday\n\nMr Khan was recalling his friendship with Diana when journalists were allowed into his chamber for a few seconds to see the royal couple meeting him at his official residence\n\n'The political parties were not headed by what would be politicians. They were political mafias.\n\n'The heads of both parties are now in jail! It was a very difficult fight.\n\n'It's not a normal, like, for instance, England's parliamentary democracy would be tame compared to the sort of struggle I had to go through.'\n\nThe royal couple met Mr Khan on their first full day of engagements in the country on Tuesday.\n\nIn 1996, Diana took William to see Mr Khan and his then wife, Jemima Goldsmith, at the Goldsmith family home in Richmond.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge (left) was the image of Princess Diana (pictured in 1991, right) when she and Prince William arrived in northern Pakistan to visit the Himalayan foothills on the second day of their tour\n\nWilliam recalled how everyone laughed at a gathering when the former Sussex and Worcestershire cricketer announced his political ambition to the then teenage Prince William and Diana.\n\nMr Khan, who was finally elected Pakistani Prime Minister in July 2018, suggested it had been as hard a slog as his earlier career as a Test cricketer.\n\n'When I went with my mother to see a Test match my cousin was playing and he scored a century and I told my mother I wanted to be a Test cricketer,' he said.\n\n'I never realised how difficult it was to eventually become one. Similarly, when I told you that I wanted to succeed I didn't realise it would take me 22 years.'\n\nPrincess Diana poses with Education Minister for Punjab Province Iqbal Chaudhary (second left), Jemima Khan, holding her son Sulaiman Isa, son of Jemima and Imran Khan, and her former husband, Mr Khan (right), at Lahore Airport in Pakistan in 1997\n\nWilliam, 37, replied: 'Sure. It's not so easy.'\n\nHis wife Kate, who was wearing white trousers by the Pakistani designer Maheen Khan, an emerald green tunic by Catherine Walker and a navy patterned scarf by Satrangi, another local designer, and earrings by the Pakistani firm Zeen, interjected: 'You stuck with it.'\n\nThe Prime Minister was recalling his friendship with Diana when journalists were allowed into his chamber for a few seconds to see the royal couple meeting him at his official residence in Islamabad.\n\nThey spoke about one of the places that the royal couple will visit tomorrow - the destination is currently under wraps - and Mr Khan said he thought Diana might have been there before.\n\nMr Khan uses the residence - known simply as The Prime Minister's House, for official entertaining but actually lives in his private house on the outskirts of the capital.\n\nThe Oxford-educated politician studied politics, philosophy, and economics at Keble College in the city of dreaming spurs between 1972 and 1975 before becoming a professional cricketer.\n\nThe tour was the first time a Royal Family member has set foot in Pakistan for 13 years due to violence and terrorism that has blighted the country, including the assassination of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007.", "description": "Pakistan's Prime Minister met the royal couple in Islamabad as part of their five-day tour.
