I was sure I was not offside, I was surprised the referee whistled, but I tried to finish because I was sure.\n\n\u201cI just heard the crowd say it was offside, but then it was a goal so I was happy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strange feeling [waiting for a VAR review], you cannot celebrate 100 per cent, but it\u2019s OK. I am happy.\u201d\n\nUnited goalkeeper David De Gea insisted the linesman raising his flag before Aubameyang applied the finish did not affect any of United\u2019s players.\n\nHe said: \u201cWell it was a big mistake for us, we gave away an important goal. Of course it is easier if the linesman keeps his flag down, but we know there is VAR. If it is offside, it is offside. We need to stay focused.\n\n\u201cThis is Manchester United, we play at Old Trafford, so we have to win these games. We have a young team, but the lads have to react and play better to win these games.\u201d\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer was frustrated his team could not find a second goal, but he did not criticise the process that led to the awarding of Aubameyang\u2019s goal.\n\nHe told Sky Sports: \u201cAnother time we get one up and we don\u2019t get the second goal we want to get. That is the learning for this team. We need to be more clinical at both ends of the pitch.\n\n\u201cWe will learn, but today is a steep learning curve for a few. It\u2019s a bad goal to give away, but sometimes you make those passes and it looks good.\n\n\u201cIt was a good finish by the boy [Aubameyang]. You think at the time maybe Harry (Maguire) managed to get out, but a few yards onside and a good finish.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was happy to leave Old Trafford with a point as his equaliser earned Arsenal a 1-1 draw with Manchester United.
