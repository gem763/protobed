Perry will travel in the coming week to Saudi Arabia to discuss possible sales of U.S. liquefied natural gas and Saudi efforts to develop a nuclear power program. Perry held talks in the United Arab Emirates and visited the country\u2019s largest solar-power facility at a site near the U.A.E.\u2019s commercial hub of Dubai.\n\nThe U.S. sent 11 LNG shipments to the U.A.E. over the past three years and is seeking to sell more of the fuel there and to Saudi Arabia, Perry said.\n\nThe world needs to be prepared for attacks disrupting the global economy, and the U.S., Saudi Arabia and other allies are discussing the safety of oil supply routes, he said. Aerial strikes against Saudi oil facilities on Sept. 14 temporarily knocked out half of the kingdom\u2019s output, and the U.S. is currently doing enough to help Saudi Arabia defend against such attacks in the future, Perry said.\n\nWashington won\u2019t hold a grudge forever against Saudi Arabia over the murder last October of government critic and U.S. columnist Jamal Khashoggi, though there\u2019s not a \u201cmassive amount of forgiveness\u201d in Congress for his killing in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Perry said.\n\nThe energy secretary said he asked U.S. President Donald Trump to call Ukraine to try to sell U.S. LNG there. The approach to Ukraine is important for energy sales and to break that country\u2019s over-reliance on Russian gas, he said.\n\nThe U.S. is \u201cmaking progress\u201d with its Middle East foreign policy, while efforts to impeach Trump won\u2019t be an issue in the U.S. presidential election next year and will go away in six months, Perry said.\n\n--With assistance from Giovanni Prati.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Anthony DiPaola in Dubai at adipaola@bloomberg.net;Manus Cranny in London at mcranny@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nayla Razzouk at nrazzouk2@bloomberg.net, Bruce Stanley\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Global markets are \u201cawash\u201d in crude thanks to the surge in U.S. oil output, and the boom looks set to continue, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said in a Bloomberg TV interview.U.S. shale production has turned the world \u201con its head,\u201d and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is \u201coff a bit\u201d in a report", "authors": ["Anthony Dipaola", "Manus Cranny"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
