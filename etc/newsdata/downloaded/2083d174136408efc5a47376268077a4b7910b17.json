Taylor, 28, and infielder Wilmer Difo, 27, both earned player of the week awards in their final days at the minor league level. With Triple-A Fresno, Difo was named Pacific Coast League player of the week Tuesday, and Taylor earned the same honor last week in the Double-A Eastern League.\n\nThe veterans gladly traded in those laurels to aid the Nationals, a team that especially needs reinforcements in the outfield.\n\nTaylor and Difo were part of Washington playoff teams in 2016 and 2017. Now they will get to aid another postseason push after being called up from the minors Tuesday. The Nationals hold the top spot in the NL wild card race.\n\n\u201cBoth have been here before. They get it,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cIt is going to take more than 25 guys to get this done.\u201d\n\nTaylor has been mostly a center fielder, but got a chance to play right in nine games with Harrisburg. There could be a need there for Washington, as regular right fielder Adam Eaton was out of the starting lineup again Wednesday. Veteran outfielder Gerardo Parra made the start in right Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nEaton was hit with a pitch near the knee last week against the Orioles and has a bad bone bruise, Martinez said.\n\nTaylor is a standout defender who used to be the Nationals\u2018 regular center fielder. He is also fast, with 24 steals in 30 attempts last year for Washington and 75 in 96 tries in his major league career.\n\nBut he has struggled with a high strikeout percentage and was hitting just .211 in the majors this year in 76 at-bats when he was sent down to Harrisburg in June.\n\nHe got to play on a regular basis there and hit .248 with nine homers and 10 steals in 57 games.\n\n\u201cI started to feel pretty comfortable at the plate,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt was great to play, get at-bats and be on the field. I was able to get my rhythm back a little bit. It was a good opportunity.\u201d\n\nTaylor has always been a team-first player who flourished under former manager Dusty Baker, who was let go after the 2017 season. Now the Florida native wants to contribute for Martinez.\n\n\u201cAny way I can, whether it is on defense or on the bases or at the plate,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nDifo, who hit .300 at Fresno, is also quick and can play second, short and third. Martinez said he may also take some balls in the outfield just in case.\n\n\u201cHe is another guy who can come off the bench and pinch-run,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nTop prospect Carter Kieboom (.303, 16 home runs), like Difo, was an infielder on the 40-man roster at Fresno. The Triple-A team ended its season Monday, but Martinez said Kieboom will head to the team\u2019s spring training facility in Florida and continue to work out in case he is needed down the stretch.\n\nThe Nationals begin a four-game series Thursday in Atlanta against the first-place Braves. Stephen Strasburg (16-5, 3.47) will pitch for the Nationals against Atlanta lefty Max Fried (15-4, 4.05).\n\n\u201cIt is always nice when you are in a playoff face, to play games that matter,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
