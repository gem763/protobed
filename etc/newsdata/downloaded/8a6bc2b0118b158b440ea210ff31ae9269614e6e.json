Perhaps daunted by the scale of the occasion \u2013 Japan is the first Asian and Tier-Two nation to host the tournament \u2013 the home side looked nervous in those opening encounters here at the Tokyo Stadium.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Japan\u2019s fly-half Yu Tamura was charged down attempting to clear his lines after just three minutes, the ball rolling just out of reach before a Russian hand could get to it. Sixty seconds later, though, and Lyn Jones\u2019 men had the lead.\n\nIt left Japan\u2019s fervent fanbase stunned. After a mistake from full-back William Tupou for what should have been a routine gather, Kirill Golosnitskiy pounced to break free and touch down for the opening score of the open tournament.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The hosts lacked confidence in their handling and struggled to match their opponents\u2019 physicality. There was little shape and order, with the occasional moment of brilliance offset by a careless mistake or lapse in concentration.\n\nStill, Japan pushed on and, after seeing what looked to be his second try chalked off by Nigel Owens, Matsushima was soon back at it, using his speed to surge over the white line down near the right-hand corner.\n\nPieter Labuschagne added the third after the break, with Japan finally stamping their authority on the match. After wrestling the ball out of Andrey Ostrikov\u2019s hands, the flanker put the burners on to charge down the narrow corridor that had opened up behind Russia\u2019s defence and finish behind the posts.\n\nThis was the beginning of the end for Russia. Struggling for fitness against their better drilled opponents, the Bears had little to offer \u2013 Yury Kushnarev\u2019s 61st-minute penalty kick aside.\n\nMatsushima added the finishing touches with a sublime solo effort 11 minutes before time, slicing open the Russian defence with a slaloming run from the 22-metre line that had the crowd on his feet. It was just one of the many moments in which the South African-born winger had the audience enthralled in rapture. Every time he found himself with possession, always kicking away in explosive fashion, the Tokyo Stadium felt charged with electricity.\n\nThe overall performance itself may not have raised hopes of a romantic World Cup run, but with individuals such as Matsushima among their ranks, Japan will know that a moment of magic is never far away \u2013 and, with it, the promise of the unexpected.", "description": "They took their time, but eventually Japan got there.
