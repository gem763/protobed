It\u2019s just too much money,\u201d said Chris Lippincott, a Texas-based Democratic strategist who ran a super PAC opposing Sen. Ted Cruz last year. \u201cThat\u2019s real trouble \u2026 I\u2019m not here to curse the dark, but it\u2019s dark.\u201d\n\nAnd the situation stands to get worse.\n\nSince the start of the year, Trump\u2019s campaign operation has run an expensive, far-reaching effort to find new small-dollar donors that is already beginning to pay dividends. The campaign netted 313,000 new donors between July and the end of September, according to numbers provided by the RNC, after spending $4.2 million in advertising on Facebook over the last 90 days.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are still four or five months away \u2014 at the earliest \u2014 from settling on a nominee.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the Democratic candidate is going to be able to even compete with such a shorter timeline, even if they have significant resources after the convention,\u201d said Tara McGowan, founder and chief executive officer of the progressive group ACRONYM.\n\nINTERACTIVE: Click to see a run-through of every 2020 Democratic candidate\u2019s campaign fundraising for the third quarter.\n\nWith the Democratic primary in full swing, McGowan said, \u201cThere\u2019s two separate elections going on, and the really unfortunate part is Trump is the only one involved in the general election today.\u201d\n\nThe spending disparity could have wide-ranging consequences in the battle to defeat the president. Trump\u2019s money is currently allowing him, through social media, to reach more potential donors in the run-up to 2020. And his war chest eventually could enable him to expand the electoral map into states such as Minnesota and Nevada, where Trump and the Nevada Republican Party are opening a headquarters on Tuesday. Democrats might also be limited in their own efforts to stretch the map in places such as Arizona, Georgia, and even Texas.\n\nThere is one area in which Democrats are not collectively sucking wind. Together, the party\u2019s massive field of Democratic presidential candidates has out-raised Trump and the RNC. But that money is working at cross-purposes in a competitive primary. And the two candidates leading in the polls have given cause for concern about their fundraising in a general election.\n\nJoe Biden, despite placing an emphasis on large-dollar fundraising, saw his numbers fall off in the third quarter, ending September with just $9 million on hand. Elizabeth Warren, whose own financial condition is healthier \u2014 she holds nearly $26 million \u2014 recently pledged to forego big-money fundraisers not only in the primary, but if she becomes the nominee.\n\nMark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, said Democrats\u2019 potential fundraising imbalance with Trump \u201ccould be a huge challenge.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump and the Republicans are bankrolling an enormous amount of money, and they have no competitive primary, or very little of one,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it could be a struggle.\u201d\n\nBut Longabaugh predicts the nomination will be settled \u201cfairly quickly \u2026 pretty well done by the end of March,\u201d in which case he said Democrats are \u201cgoing to have a good amount of time to raise the resources that are necessary for the fall.\u201d\n\nSome Democratic campaign veterans fear the party is underestimating both the level of Trump\u2019s preparations for 2020 and what it will take to unseat a sitting president. The level of preparation by Trump\u2019s staff echoes Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign, said Rufus Gifford, former finance director for Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election.\n\n\u201cWe were sophisticated, we were organized, and we were well-funded. This is everything the Trump operation is. Taking away his craziness, he has an extremely professional operation,\u201d said Gifford, who has argued in recent days that Democrats like Warren need to lean more into fundraising if they want to compete against Trump in the general election.\n\n\"We have got to be prepared, six months from now or less, to make sure that the nominee\u2019s political operation is ready to hit the ground running, and ready to do everything they can do\u201d to defeat Trump, Gifford said.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a badly outgunned national party \u2014 the DNC had only $8.2 million on hand at the end of August, a fraction of the RNC\u2019s nearly $54 million \u2014 only one major Democratic outside group has started spending money to counter the Trump campaign.\n\nPriorities USA, the SuperPAC poised to spend the most on behalf of Democrats in the 2020 presidential cycle, started spending money this fall, training its firepower on four battleground states \u2014 Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Florida. Since July, according to Advertising Analytics, Priorities has spent $2.5 million on digital efforts in those four states.\n\nThe daunting sums raised by both the RNC and Trump in the third quarter is nothing compared to what Democrats are expecting Republicans will churn out by year\u2019s end, said Priorities USA Executive Director Patrick McHugh.", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Dick Harpootlian", "Former Dnc Member", "Two-Time South Carolina Democratic Party Chair"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c0/bd/931a92f94eb4baf72c53798ad770/20191020-trump-2-rally-2020-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
