where medics believe that a baby will die before, during or shortly after birth - are not grounds for a legal abortion in Northern Ireland.\n\nIf you are reading this page on the BBC News app, you will need to visit the mobile version of the BBC website to submit your question on this topic.\n\nWhat could happen at midnight?\n\nAbortion will be decriminalised if the devolved government is not restored.\n\nThe legislation brought in by MPs at Westminster means the UK government will assume responsibility for introducing new regulations to provide greater access to terminations by next April.\n\nUnder the act, same sex marriage will become legal in Northern Ireland in January, with the first wedding expected the following month.\n\nWhat positions are the NI parties taking?\n\nSinn F\u00e9in said the recall was merely \"about playing to the gallery\" and its MLAs (members of the legislative assembly) would not go.\n\nThe SDLP did not sign the petition either but it has a number of MLAs who are opposed to abortion and are understood to be considering attending the recall sitting in spite of party leader Colum Eastwood branding the move a \"stunt\".\n\nThe SDLP has described itself as a \"pro-life party\" but its politicians are free to vote with their conscience on abortion laws.\n\nImage copyright Pacemaker Image caption Stormont is returning but not to hold talks - the focus is on the issue of abortion\n\nThe DUP MLA Gordon Lyons said his party wanted to return to Stormont to \"take decisions on issues that matter to the people of Northern Ireland\".\n\nThe Ulster Unionist Party said its 10 MLAs would go to the chamber and it has also proposed a second petition to recall the assembly on Tuesday.\n\nThe UUP's Doug Beattie said his party's petition was for MLAs to express anger about the collapse of devolution more than 1,000 days ago.\n\nHe denied the UUP was engaging in \"stunt politics\" of its own and said something needed to be done given the absence of formal talks to restore power-sharing at Stormont.\n\nImage caption Both sides of the abortion debate are holding protests at Stormont\n\nAlliance Party leader Naomi Long said none of her party's MLAs would be attending and she described the recall as a \"cynical political stunt\".\n\n\"The intention of this recall is not to block abortion law and equal marriage but to create the illusion the DUP are trying to do so,\" she added.\n\nThe Green Party leader Clare Bailey said it was a \"shameful pantomime\" and that she would not enter the chamber.", "description": "Some Stormont assembly members meet for the first time in nearly three years only to be told they \"cannot do any business\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E18D/production/_109314775_stormont2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
