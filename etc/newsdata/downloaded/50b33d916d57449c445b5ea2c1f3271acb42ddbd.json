I must say that the bill will have to be pulled and we will have to go forward...to a general election,\" Johnson said.\n\nOn Monday, Johnson was forced to abandon his attempt to have a straight 'yes or no' vote on his Brexit deal and is instead trying to speed through the legislation for Britain to leave the EU through the House of Commons.\n\nREAD: Brexit: What's in the Withdrawal Agreement Bill?\n\n\"I hope parliament today votes to take back control for itself,\" said Johnson.\n\n\"The public doesn't want any more delays, neither do other European leaders and neither do I. Let's get Brexit done on 31 October and move on.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he opposes Johnson's sell-out deal and will seize every opportunity to ensure people are given the final say on it.\n\nDefeat in either vote would scupper Johnson's plans to leave the EU - \"do or die\" - on October 31.\n\nHe would then have to decide whether to abide by a law that demands he accept any Brexit delay offered by the EU or somehow leave without a divorce deal.\n\nEven a victory may simply open up another opportunity for opponents to ambush the government with amendments that could wreck Johnson's plans.\n\nThe government has indicated that negotiations with the EU are closed, so any amendment changing the shape of the deal would be highly problematic.\n\nUnder the government's current plans, the legislation would be rushed through the House of Commons in just three days.\n\nPrevious bills to implement major European treaties have taken between 10 and 40 sitting days to get through parliament, according to the Institute of Government.\n\nDebate in the House of Commons\n\nBoris Johnson defended his Brexit deal in the House of Commons on Tuesday, stating that the UK would have the \"highest possible standards\" and \"keep pace\" with Brussels on environmental standards.\n\nBut MPs doubted that Johnson was being truthful, with many reiterating that they did not trust the Prime Minister.\n\nThere would be \"no checks\", Johnson said, but some \"light touch\" measures between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, a statement which received a large reaction from the Commons.\n\n\"They automatically dissolve unless a majority of the Northern Irish assembly in Stormont votes to keep them,\" he said, calling the measures \"transitory\".\n\nLabour MP Liz Kendall told Boris Johnson that he had not made a choice about whether to follow EU rules or not and said he was just \"continuing the agony for years to come\".\n\nBut Johnson worked to gain votes in the House of Commons, saying later on: \"Is there anyone who seriously believes that the EU would reopen the withdrawal agreement again?... The deal on the table is the one contained in this bill.\"\n\nHe said if the House of Commons delayed any further, \"the paralysis\" would continue.\n\nWant more news?", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces two pivotal Brexit votes in the British parliament on Tuesday.
