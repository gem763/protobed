The clip is an edited version of a climactic, hyperviolent scene from the 2014 action film \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service,\u201d in which the protagonist kills nearly 40 people in roughly three minutes while the Lynyrd Skynyrd song \u201cFree Bird\u201d plays. In the clip, President Trump\u2019s face is crudely edited on top of the protagonist\u2019s during the spree, which involves guns, hand-to-hand combat and, at one point, a blowtorch; his victims\u2019 faces have been replaced with the faces of politicians , journalists, entertainers and the logos of media organizations. Then, the fake president shoots in the head a person whose face has been replaced by the Black Lives Matter logo .\n\nThe video was shown at a three-day conference at Mr. Trump\u2019s Doral resort in Miami, hosted by the pro-Trump organization American Priority. The conference denounced the video as \u201cunauthorized,\u201d and a spokesman for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign said the president knew nothing about it . The White House press secretary tweeted on Monday that the president hadn\u2019t seen the video but that he \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d it based on its description.\n\nStill, the video is jarring, both for its content and for the political climate it has been dropped into. In 2019, there have been at least 21 deadly mass shootings in the United States \u2014 some in places of worship, like April\u2019s synagogue shooting in Poway, Calif. Fifty-three people died in mass shootings in August alone. The violence has prompted some Democrats, like the presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, to call for assault weapons bans, while some Republicans have suggested that such bans would lead to \u201ca lot of violence.\u201d Two weeks ago, Mr. Trump tweeted a warning from a pastor arguing that \u201ca Civil War like fracture in this Nation\u201d might occur should Mr. Trump be removed from office.", "description": "The absurdity of memes like the one shared widely on Sunday evening gives cover to their creators.", "authors": ["Charlie Warzel"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/14/opinion/14warzel/14warzel-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
