Dudes. My boys. Jaunterinos. I get it. Breaking up with someone is hard. It\u2019s usually not fun, and you\u2019ll probably hurt the other person\u2019s feelings in the process. But I swear to god, you can\u2019t just \u201cfizz\u201d someone out of your life.\n\nFizzing, in case you\u2019re not familiar, is a trendy new name for that age-old dating practice where you end things with someone by cutting off contact. Men\u2019s Health contributors Zachary Zane and Philip Ellis wrote about fizzing earlier this week, explaining that it\u2019s \u201cwhen you happily date someone for a couple of months, and things peter out without a formal breakup conversation.\u201d\n\nSounds a lot like ghosting someone, right? Well, it\u2019s different\u2014at least according to Zane and Ellis. Ghosting is where you actively ignore someone you\u2019ve been seeing, leaving them confused about the end of their relationship. Fizzing, they argue, is when you both stop reaching out at the same time, perhaps due to a shared, though unspoken, lack of interest in keeping things going with the other party.\n\nThat distinction makes sense, I guess, but it still strikes me as two ways of solving the exact same problem: You don\u2019t want to see someone anymore, but you also don\u2019t want to tell them you don\u2019t want to see them anymore, so you simply stop seeing them without telling them you\u2019ve stopped seeing them.\n\nI really don\u2019t want to invoke regressive gendered language that associates maleness with stereotypical traits like masculinity, strength, force, and courage, but in this case I must be clear: Man the fuck up! If you want to end things with someone, own that desire and tell them directly! Why? It\u2019ll be better for you\u2014and better for her/him/them\u2014in the long run. Even the experts agree!\n\n\"Rarely do both people have exactly the same feelings about what has happened, what is happening and what not speaking means,\u201d Gail Saltz, MD, an associate professor of psychiatry at the NY Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine, told Zane and Ellis. \"Avoidance denies closure, [and] keeps either of you from learning about yourselves and from possibly finding out there was something that could have been repaired and made the relationship worth keeping.\u201d\n\nSo, now that you know what you must do, the question remains: Do You Have To Directly Acknowledge The Situation? Consider carefully which of the following scenarios apply before making your next move.\n\nThis person is my girlfriend/boyfriend/partner: I shouldn\u2019t have to tell you to break up with them in person??? You must directly acknowledge this situation.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t have to tell you to break up with them in person??? You must directly acknowledge this situation. We\u2019ve been seeing each other/dating/whatever for at least couple months (as in having sex but also going on dates, talking about feelings, revealing ourselves as more than just holes, but hearts and minds as well): You must directly acknowledge the situation and do this in person (barring any personal safety concerns, obviously!). You owe them this. Think of the guilt you\u2019ll carry if you text them \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d Have you no shame? Wait, what? You don\u2019t? OK, then just call them or text them, you monster.\n\nYou must directly acknowledge the situation and do this in person (barring any personal safety concerns, obviously!). You owe them this.

We\u2019ve been fucking and maybe gone on like one or two dates: Please consider directly acknowledging the situation and breaking things off in person, especially if you\u2019re in a community with your partner and will likely see them in the future. If not and you\u2019ll probably never see them again, a phone call is fine.\n\nPlease consider directly acknowledging the situation and breaking things off in person, especially if you\u2019re in a community with your partner and will likely see them in the future.

Texting is fine! Continuing to look at their Instagram Story every day and liking all of their posts is not! Don\u2019t be weird!\n\nThe next time they hit you up, say you\u2019re not interested in continuing this thing! Texting is fine! Continuing to look at their Instagram Story every day and liking all of their posts is not! Don\u2019t be weird! We\u2019ve just been fucking, but only one time: Basically same rules, but also feel free to ignore/block/whatever. Telling someone \u201cno\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not interested\u201d isn\u2019t that hard, but also\u2026you don\u2019t know this person. You don\u2019t owe them anything! Unless you know them. Then you owe them a simple text!\n\nIn conclusion, stop being weird! Own your desires! Other people are people, even the ones you don\u2019t want to fuck anymore.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Harron Walker on Twitter .", "description": "Don't \"ghost\" or \"fizz\" or whatever cute term we're currently using to describe avoiding a necessary human conversation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9f75a305193d0009b94abc/lede/1570731429974-Two-transmasculine-people-sitting-together-and-having-a-serious-conversation.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8724xh;0xw,0.0755xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
