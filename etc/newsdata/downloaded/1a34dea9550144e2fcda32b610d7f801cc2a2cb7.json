Todd has said he found his daughter's elopement 'disrespectful'.\n\nHe also expressed disappointment when he found out his daughter was four months pregnant.

Much of the series emphasizes Todd Chrisley's obsessive yet comedic efforts to keep tabs on three of his kids, two of whom are in their 20s, and his mother. The family moved to Tennessee from the Atlanta area a few years ago.\n\n'It's a blessing I don't travel to Nashville anymore,' the message thread continues.\n\nThe series has aired on USA for seven seasons and recently premiered a spinoff called 'Growing Up Chrisley,' featuring his kids Chase and Savannah, who move to Los Angeles. Todd Chrisley also briefly hosted a talk show, 'According to Chrisley,' for the network. Todd, 51, and Julie Chrisley, 46, also have a podcast called 'Chrisley Confessions.'\n\nSeparately, the Chrisleys were indicted in August on federal charges of tax evasion, conspiracy, bank fraud and wire fraud. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe couple said the 'bogus' claims cost them $150,000 to settle in the agreement which credited them with tax refunds for some tax years and said they owed nothing in others\n\n'The IRS completed their audit for the criminal side and then turned over the returns to us so we could bill them as well,' other messages from 'Josh' read. 'The Feds are pushing it because they are saying the 75 million deal is for real, including a show for your grandma. By herself.'\n\nAs a result of Waites alleged efforts, which ultimately failed, the Chrisleys were forced to 'incur substantial personal and financial hardship,' the suit says.\n\nThe lawsuit asks for a jury trial and seeks compensatory and punitive damages, as well as reimbursement for legal costs.\n\nThe Chrisleys last month reached an agreement to settle allegations that they failed to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in state income taxes.\n\nThe agreement signed September 27 credited them with tax refunds for some tax years and said they owed nothing in others.\n\nAccording to the settlement, the Chrisleys agreed to pay a little under $150,000 to resolve the claims.\n\nDepartment of Revenue spokesman Gaston added Tuesday: 'Our investigators are fair and impartial in their work with a commitment to ensuring compliance with the law,' he wrote. 'This development is disappointing and their accusations are unfounded, but we will decline to provide any further comment on this matter.'", "description": "Reality television personalities Todd and Julie Chrisley in a Tuesday lawsuit accused Georgia tax official, Joshua Waites, of abusing his office to pursue 'bogus tax evasion claims' against them.", "authors": ["Leah Simpson For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/20/19756676-0-image-a-61_1571168567819.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
