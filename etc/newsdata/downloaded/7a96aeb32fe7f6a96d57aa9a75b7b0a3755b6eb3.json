REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Almost 40% of British businesses with suppliers in the European Union have signed \u201cBrexit clauses\u201d to allow prices or other terms to be renegotiated if trade tariffs return after a no-deal departure from the bloc, a survey showed on Wednesday.\n\nThe Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (CIPS) said the survey of 817 supply chain managers in Britain and the EU showed that British firms would incur the cost of any tariffs when buying parts from the bloc, potentially pushing up prices.\n\n\u201cThese potential additional costs are being written into contracts ahead of time,\u201d CIPS economist John Glen said. \u201cWhere this would be particularly damaging is SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) who are not flush with cash.\u201d\n\nBritish companies are struggling to prepare for Britain\u2019s departure from the EU - the country\u2019s biggest trade upheaval in half a century - due to extreme levels of political uncertainty.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to take Britain out of the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc by Oct. 31 with or without a deal, but opposition lawmakers are trying to force another delay.\n\nThe survey, which monitors businesses in sectors including aerospace, construction, food and medical, also found only 22% of respondents among British firms with EU suppliers believed they had completed the paperwork to trade outside the bloc.", "description": "Almost 40% of British businesses with suppliers in the European Union have signed \"Brexit clauses\" to allow prices or other terms to be renegotiated if trade tariffs return after a no-deal departure from the bloc, a survey showed on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1431014289&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G212", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
