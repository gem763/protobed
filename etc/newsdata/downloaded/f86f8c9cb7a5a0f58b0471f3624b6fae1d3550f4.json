REUTERS/Vivek Prakash/File Photo\n\nChief Executive Salil Parekh, who took charge in 2018, has bypassed reviews and approvals for large deals for fear of reduced profits having a negative impact on its shares, the letter signed by \u201cethical employees\u201d said.\n\n\u201cSeveral billion dollar deals of last few quarters have nil margin,\u201d said the Sept. 20 letter, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, which implies the company did not actually profit from the deals.\n\nBengaluru-headquartered Infosys, considered India\u2019s IT bellwether, also did not take into account expenses such as visa costs to boost profit, while it was pressured not to recognise reversals of a $50 million upfront payment in a contract, which is against accounting practices.\n\n\u201cCEO is bypassing reviews and approvals and instructing sales (team) not to send mails for approval. He directs them to make wrong assumptions to show margins,\u201d the letter said, adding that Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy prevents employees from highlighting issues around large deals in presentations to the company\u2019s board.\n\nReuters could not independently verify claims made in the letter.\n\nParekh did not respond to Reuters\u2019 request for a comment.\n\nInfosys Chairman Nandan Nilekani said in a statement on Tuesday that the complaints were placed before the audit committee and the non-executive members of the board.\n\nParekh and CFO Roy have been recused from the matter to ensure an independent investigation, said Nilekani, who is credited for growing Infosys\u2019 annual revenue by four-fold to $2 billion during his 2002-2007 tenure as CEO.\n\nThe allegations could start a fresh storm at Infosys, which just two years ago endured a shake-up that saw its then CEO Vishal Sikka leave after a public battle with founders.\n\nShares of Infosys fell as much as 16% on Tuesday, its biggest intraday percentage drop since April 2013. The fall wiped out 470 billion rupees ($6.6 billion) in market capitalisation, which was at 2.8 trillion rupees as of 1220 local time (0650 GMT).\n\n\u201cInfosys is the blue-eyed boy as far as corporate governance is concerned... two complaints in two years could shake investor confidence, at least temporarily,\u201d said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities.\n\nThe accusations come days after Infosys raised its full-year revenue guidance on upbeat client demand and said it signed $2.8 billion worth of large deals in the September quarter, helping margin grow by 120 basis points from the previous quarter.\n\nInfosys, whose more than 1,300 clients include Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), also reported a forecast-beating operating profit margin of 21.7%, or 100 basis points higher than analysts\u2019 average estimate by Refinitiv.\n\nAnother of the complaints \"largely deals with allegations relating to the CEO's international travel to the U.S. and Mumbai,\" Nilekani added. (bit.ly/2P3YbDv)\n\nThe Economic Times first reported the details of the letter on Monday. (bit.ly/2o5UWAd)\n\nThe audit committee has retained law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas to conduct an independent investigation, and the company\u2019s board will take appropriate steps based on the outcome of the investigation, the company said.", "description": "India's No.2 software services exporter, Infosys Ltd , is probing whistleblower complaints that its top two executives engaged in \"unethical practices\" to boost short-term revenue and profit, sending its shares down 16% on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Sankalp Phartiyal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443660624&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0AD", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
