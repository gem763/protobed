Teams that are the Patriots have a much more simple approach, one that isn\u2019t tied to feeding any one specific pass-catcher.\n\nThat\u2019s the gist of quarterback Tom Brady\u2018s comments after Monday night\u2019s 33-0 win over the Jets regarding the emergence of undrafted rookie receiver Jakobi Meyers.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMeyers, from North Carolina State, had four catches through the first five weeks of the season. In the past two games, he\u2019s had four receptions for 54 yards and five for 47, respectively. While not eye-popping stats, Meyers is following the \u201cdo your job\u201d mantra by running routes, getting open, and catching the ball when Brady decides Meyers is indeed the open man.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done a great job taking advantage of his opportunity,\u201d Brady told reporters on Monday night. \u201cI\u2019ll keep throwing it to him. He does a good job of getting open. I\u2019ll just keep trying to go to the open guy.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the way it should be. Not \u201cI\u2019m going to try to get Julian Edelman involved early because if he doesn\u2019t have multiple catches by the end of the first quarter he starts whining,\u201d but \u201cI\u2019ll just keep trying to go to the open guy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a simple concept, but plenty of teams struggle to master it. The Patriots\u2019 success flows in large part from their ability to master all of the simple concepts, while doing just well enough with the complex areas of coaching and execution to keep winning and winning and winning.", "description": "Teams that aren't the Patriots often get caught up in the urgency to throw the ball to a specific receiver.
