Senator Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, was harsher.\n\n\u201cIf the president asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite Mr. Schumer\u2019s demands, most attention on Monday remained on the House, where Democrats hold the majority and the power to impeach Mr. Trump, and are already pursuing an investigation to determine whether they should do so over his attempts to obstruct the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. A crucial element of any potential case against the president, lawmakers have said, would be his stonewalling of congressional attempts to investigate him and his administration.\n\nAfter months of debate over impeachment, the political ground appeared to be shifting over the weekend for Democrats, with growing numbers of influential lawmakers saying that if the allegations were true, and the president continued to try to shield information from Congress, they would be left with no option but to initiate impeachment proceedings.\n\nIn the short-term, even the House has relatively few options if the administration maintains its position .\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee, which first learned of and publicized the existence of the whistle-blower complaint, has called a hearing for Thursday to press Mr. Maguire on why he declined to share it with Congress, despite a request to do so from the intelligence agencies\u2019 internal watchdog. But Mr. Maguire has been instructed by the Justice Department and the White House not to produce the material.\n\nThe House could sue to try to force disclosure under its interpretation of the whistle-blower law, but as with other legal challenges to the White House\u2019s stonewalling, the courts could take more than a year to sort the case out, a nonstarter for Democrats who fear there may be an ongoing threat to national security.", "description": "The Democratic leader in the Senate warned Republicans would be \u201csilent and submissive\u201d if they did not request more information.", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/23/us/politics/23dc-impeach-1/merlin_161307270_b83ebd32-b55f-4df9-b0e4-e61ae4ed99f1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
