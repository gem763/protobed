Neumann had invested $30 million in the energy technology startup in January through the 166 2nd entity.\n\nRead more: A buzzy energy startup raised $30 million from WeWork CEO Adam Neumann, then collapsed the day WeWork filed to go public\n\nFaraday Grid attracted considerable attention both for Neumann's investment and its promise of new, innovative infrastructure to modernize the UK's power grid and boost the use of renewable energy. When he invested in January, Neumann said: \"Faraday Grid will fundamentally change the way we access and use energy in the future.\"\n\nBut only five months later, Faraday Grid's board would oust CEO Andrew Scobie and install new leadership. And two months after that, the firm would run out of money and announce its administration the same day that WeWork would file for an expected multibillion-dollar IPO. A third source with knowledge of the matter recentlytold Business Insider that Faraday Grid had been burning through $2.4 million a month.\n\nFaraday Grid's former CEO Andrew Scobie.

Earlier this month, the firm said 45 employees had lost their jobs.\n\nAccording to one former employee, 166 2nd wrote to the pool of employees to offer financial help through a dedicated \"relief\" fund. 166 2nd did not specify the size of the fund but, according to the source, some employees are who have applied for help are already receiving checks. The source said 166 2nd had also offered help to overseas employees whose visas are sponsored by Faraday Grid.\n\n\"166 have been really decent,\" one former employee said. \"They've taken responsibility for the remaining staff and that's admirable.\"\n\nThe source added that Neumann's sister, Adi Neumann, had also visited Faraday Grid's head offices in Edinburgh, Scotland in March and met former CEO Scobie and other senior staff.\n\nThe source and another former employee described how the firm had spent lavishly in the runup to its collapse, both to impress Adi Neumann and to fuel a rapid expansion. Between January and June, Faraday Grid announced its expansion to the US, a new chief systems architect, comms chief, two regulatory bosses, a CFO, general counsel, COO, VP of engineering, and a new innovation centre in the Czech Republic.\n\nA spokeswoman for WeWork declined to comment.", "description": "A former employee said Neumann and his family office had been 'decent.'", "authors": ["Shona Ghosh"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6970c22e22af1f8f4b98d8-1536-768.jpg"}
