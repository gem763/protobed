The goal is to make it easier for police to identify protesters (and no doubt also to make them more susceptible to tear gas). Here\u2019s the announcement:\n\nBut the immediate reaction to the new law was the worst night of vandalism and rioting yet seen in the city. One of the incidents getting a lot of attention on social media was a group of protesters beating involved an undercover police officer. At some point, either before or during this attack, the officer shot a 14-year-old boy in the leg, making this the second time a protester has been shot by police. A crowd responded by setting off a firebomb which briefly engulfed the officer. It\u2019s amazing no one was killed:\n\nHong Kong protesters beat a police officer, set him on fire, then try to steal his sidearm after he shot a 14-year-old protester in the leg with another live round. Again, another young protester has been shot with a live round.

In Kwun Tong, Sha Tin and Sha Tin Wai MTR stations, they destroyed turnstiles, smashed advertisement billboards and daubed graffiti on the walls and ticket machines. A train was seen with its roof on fire in Sha Tin, and in Shek Mun a water hydrant was set off, flooding the station. As the night wore on, huge fires were lit at entrances of Causeway Bay, Mong Kok and Tsuen Wan MTR stations. By 10.30pm, they had forced the closure of every MTR station in an unprecedented shutdown of the entire railway network.\n\nThe Guardian put together this video summarizing some of the Metro vandalism:\n\nAnother target of the protesters was banks and shops connected to China.\n\nShops and banks with links to mainland China were also targeted by rioters. They smashed the glass facade of a Bank of China branch in Tsuen Wan and threw petrol bombs inside. ATMs were smashed or set alight in Mong Kok and other areas. In Central, they smashed shop windows of MX, a food chain owned by Maxim\u2019s. Its founder\u2019s daughter, Annie Wu, infuriated protesters last month by calling them rioters and saying they did not represent Hong Kong.\n\nHere\u2019s video of one of the bank branches being set on fire:\n\nProtesters have set fire to a China Construction Bank in Causeway Bay, the main shopping district of Hong Kong Island. Bank of China branches were also targeted. A large bottle of petrol is seen being carried by the protester. #AntiMaskLaw #HongKongProtests pic.twitter.com/olLFoIjwLl \u2014 Michael Zhang \u5f35\u96e8\u8ed2 (@YuxuanMichael) October 4, 2019\n\nMore:\n\nAnother video getting a lot of attention today involves an officer worker for a Chinese bank. He was surrounded by protesters who began chanting at him. His co-workers tried to lead him back inside. Before reaching the door, he turned and said, \u201cWe\u2019re all Chinese,\u201d in Mandarin, which really angered the protesters. That resulted in someone coming forward and hitting the guy in the face several times:\n\nMandarin speaking office worker on lunch break harassed by so called Hong Kong press, who refused to show him press ID. He declared \u201cWe\u2019re All Chinese\u201d bf returning 2 office. Masked White man blocked his way. Hong Kong protester attacked him from behind pic.twitter.com/LSPvKdYOtt \u2014 Carl Zha (@CarlZha) October 4, 2019\n\nI think the violence is going to be counter-productive because it will rally support for a crackdown in China. Having looked at it, I can tell you that opponents of the protesters are having a field day posting all of this video on Twitter. Today the protesters were out again, openly defying the anti-mask law:\n\nMasked protesters formed a human chain in Hong Kong on Saturday, October 5, in defiance of leader Carrie Lam, who announced emergency laws that include banning face masks at protests.https://t.co/PT3BmjVR8m pic.twitter.com/t3tNJQOtkY \u2014 The Voice of America (@VOANews) October 5, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, there are reports of a run on the banks and ATM\u2019s out of cash:\n\nBank runs all over Hong Kong now. ATM machines running out of cash but there is something more important\u2026failed leader carrie lam(b) can now officially confiscate bank accounts and assets without recourse. The HK legal system is essentially gone. #Bankruns #HKexit https://t.co/jz9sPrA30U \u2014 Kyle Bass (@Jkylebass) October 5, 2019\n\nPeople also seem to be stocking up on food and water in anticipation of trouble:\n\nHong Kong today: supermarket shelves empty, massive queues to pay, ATMs running out of money, the MTR (subway network) shut, and thousand marching through the centre of town. Not sure invoking colonial era laws banning face masks has calmed the city down. #HongKongProtest pic.twitter.com/EEijbUrLnX \u2014 Ravi Mattu (@ravmattu) October 5, 2019\n\nCarrie Lam released a 5-minute video denouncing the riots and calling for calm. Here\u2019s a shortened version:\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone really knows what is going to happen next. So far, China hasn\u2019t instituted a military crack-down, probably because Tiananment 2.0 would happen in an age of cell phone cameras and the internet. But it still feels like that\u2019s where all of this is headed. The protesters are angry and many believe this is their last chance to fight for freedom from being subsumed by the mainland\u2019s one-party, communist dictatorship. The problem is that they are a relatively small group (compared to China) of mostly unarmed people. If China does send troops it won\u2019t be a fight, it will be a massacre.", "description": "\"...an unprecedented shutdown of the entire railway network.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hong-Kong-burning.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
