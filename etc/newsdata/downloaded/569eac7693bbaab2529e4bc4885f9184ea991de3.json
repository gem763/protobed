It was a glorious\n\ntime. My children were in school in Europe.\n\n\u201cI have great friends there. And I have a memory of my performance at the Royal Albert Hall with my daughter Rhonda in my arms. That vision will always stay with me.\n\n\u201cI have many loving and wonderful memories and look forward to creating more.\u201d The Diamond Diana Top Of The World Tour \u2013 which includes dates in Leeds, Manchester and London \u2013 could earn her more than \u00a350million.\n\nAnd the 75-year-old says her stage shows will be inspired by nature.\n\n\u201cI see beauty all around me,\u201d she purrs. \u201cI love colour and things that make me feel good. Sometimes I need inspiration and I find that inspiration in nature, in the sky, in the ocean or in the colours of\n\nthe sunset.\u201d\n\nDiana \u2013 who shot to fame as one third of The Supremes \u2013 has a \u00adreputation as a fearsome diva.
