Just the way he tried to smear Hillary Clinton,\u201d Steyer said in an interview with Yahoo News Thursday, defending his political rival. \u201cI think that Mr. Biden should be left out of this. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s done anything wrong. I think a bunch of newspapers looked at it and decided he hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d\n\nSet off by a whistleblower complaint against President Trump over his repeated calls for Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter and allegedly withholding almost $400 million in military aid from Ukraine as leverage, an impeachment inquiry was announced earlier this week. Trump denounced the opening of a formal impeachment inquiry, which had been announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday, and turned to attacking Biden.\n\nTrump and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, have accused Biden, during his term as vice president, of intervening with the government of Ukraine in an effort to advance his son\u2019s business interests there.\n\nSteyer, who has been described as \u201cfiercely competitive and used to getting his way,\u201d said he will continue to believe Biden \u201cunless something new comes up,\u201d but doubts anything will.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that that\u2019s a red herring in this story,\u201d he said. \u201cThe story here is that the president of the United States once again put himself ahead of the American people and used his office to help himself.\u201d\n\nBefore Steyer announced his White House bid two months ago, he launched in 2017 a public education campaign, \u201cNeed to Impeach,\u201d investing about $40 million in \u201ca national movement of passionate, energetic advocates committed to removing Donald Trump from office.\u201d\n\n2020 Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer at the Yahoo offices in New York City on Sept. 26, 2019.

We are finally at a watershed moment. The beginning of an official impeachment inquiry is the beginning of taking our democracy back.\u201d\n\nHe now says \u201cit feels like the grassroots won, like the people of the United States were on this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was always about the people, and it\u2019s still about the people,\u201d Steyer continued. \u201cIn fact, the actual court that counts is the court of public opinion.\u201d\n\nPelosi, who has stressed for some time that any impeachment process should be understandable to the general public and that the case against Trump needs to be \u201cironclad,\u201d said, \u201cPublic sentiment is everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith it, you can accomplish almost anything,\u201d she said on Tuesday. \u201cWithout it, practically nothing.\u201d\n\nOf the Ukraine scandal, Pelosi said, \u201cWe have many other, shall we say, candidates for impeachable offenses \u2026 but this one is the most understandable by the public.\u201d\n\nTrump called the impeachment talk \u201cridiculous\u201d and another \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d On Thursday, after his acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified on Capitol Hill about the whistleblower complaint and confirmed the still-unidentified official \u201cdid the right thing,\u201d the president lamented that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff would not look into Biden and his son\u2019s dealings in Ukraine.\n\nThe unnamed whistleblower cited conversations and details provided by \u201cmore than half a dozen U.S. officials,\u201d alleging that Trump is \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d These efforts included Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, urging the government in Kyiv to investigate Biden\u2019s role in pressing for the ouster of state prosecutor Viktor Shokin in 2016.", "description": "Long-shot presidential candidate Tom Steyer, a billionaire hedge fund manager and leading Democratic donor, ruled out attacks on former Vice President Biden at the next Democratic primary debate over the allegations that are central to the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Kadia Tubman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AIz6dIgXkm8kZ198M.KjXQ--~B/aD0zMjM4O3c9NDg1NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/5f330a40-e129-11e9-bff7-470f504b61be", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
