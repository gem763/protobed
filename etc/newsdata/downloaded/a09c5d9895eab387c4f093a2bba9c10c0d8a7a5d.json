These so-called red giants then begin to lose their outer layers of material into space. More than half of such a star's mass can be shed in this manner, forming a shell of surrounding gas. At the same time, the star's core shrinks and grows hotter, emitting ultraviolet light that causes the expelled gases to glow. This type of object is called, somewhat confusingly, a planetary nebula, though it has nothing to do with planets. The name derives from the rounded, planet-like appearance of these objects in early telescopes\" - European Space Agency Nasa 2/10 Two galaxies are seen interacting with one another. This pair of galaxies is known as UGC2369 and they are being drawn together by mutual gravitational attraction.

But it was one of those repeating bursts \u2013 which offer the best chance of understanding more about the origin \u2013 that scientists picked up sending huge numbers of blasts through the FAST telescope.\n\nResearchers have been monitoring the source since since 2012, when it was first found and christened FRB121102. But now that the 500-meter FAST telescope has been switched on, scientists have been able to see even more of them.\n\nThe science team working on the telescope are now picking through the data, collected at the end of August and beginning of September, to understand where it might be coming from.\n\nAs well as allowing for the further study of existing sources, scientists hope to use the technology on the FAST telescope to find yet more FRBs, Chinese state media reported.\n\nAs well as looking for more FRBs, the telescope will be used to look for other hints to the nature of the universe, now that it is fully functioning. That will include searching for sources of hydrogen, which could shed light on how the universe came to exist.", "description": "Scientists searching through the universe for signs of alien life have picked up more than 100 signals coming from deep in space.
