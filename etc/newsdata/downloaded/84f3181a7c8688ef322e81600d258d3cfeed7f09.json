About 1 in 5 said they remain undecided, and nearly two-thirds of Democrats and independents said they could still change their minds.\n\nMany of the candidates, including Buttigieg, O\u2019Rourke and Harris, are still relatively unknown to a majority of Americans, and only about 1 in 10 said they watched this week\u2019s Democratic debate in Ohio.\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,116 adults in all, including 703 Democrats and independents. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 4 percentage points.", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden expanded his lead over more than a dozen other candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination this month as U.S. House Democrats looked into allegations that President Donald Trump tried to pressure a foreign leader to investigate him, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.", "authors": ["Chris Kahn", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442457391&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H23V", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
