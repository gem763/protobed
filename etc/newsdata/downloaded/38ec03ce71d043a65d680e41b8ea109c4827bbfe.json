CHEAP!\n\nIt\u2019s my honest opinion that almost anyone could benefit from a second computer. While I think it\u2019s always worth having something powerful and modern for your main machine, there are a lot of times where a second device \u2014 and especially a laptop \u2014 can be incredibly useful.\n\nWhether it\u2019s to do some internet browsing on holiday, check emails on the go, write your diary, or watch videos on something bigger than your phone, there are really no limits to the benefits a secondary computer can bring.\n\nNow we\u2019ve all agreed that having two (or more) computing devices is the only way forward, the next tough part is finding the right machine. I\u2019ve always liked Chromebooks for this, but have found ChromeOS not as versatile or slick as I\u2019d like.\n\nThankfully, there\u2019s another option: this $300 11\u2033 MacBook Air from Apple.\n\nHere\u2019s a photo of the 11\u2033 MacBook Air we\u2019re talking about in this piece.\n\nSo, first things first: this machine is refurbished, but has been done so by an approved vendor. I know that might put some people off, but again, if this is a second machine, the price savings on a refurbished device make it worthwhile.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that this is a 2015 11\u2033 MacBook Air model. We\u2019ve actually got one of these at home and it still works well for general browsing and work, but isn\u2019t really suitable if you\u2019re planning to be doing lots of intense video editing. But you probably knew that anyway, right?\n\nSpecs-wise, the 11\u2033 MacBook Air has a 128GB solid state hard drive, and 4GB RAM. It also has an Intel i5 1.6GHz processor. Again, nothing mind blowing about the hardware, but it should be enough to keep you going.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been looking for a second machine, this $300 11\u2033 MacBook Air from Apple could be a perfect fit. You can head over here to pick up one while the deal\u2019s still running.\n\nThis post includes affiliate links to products that you can buy online.
