He is pictured (above) during an unrelated case in March\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaking on stage during a campaign rally at the Target Center in Minneapolis yesterday. A whistleblower complaint alleges the president tried to pressure Ukraine into investigating one of his political rivals\n\nThe allegations stem from a CIA officer who claimed to have heard the full phone call between Zelensky and Trump in which the US president was said to have asked Ukrainian authorities to investigate Hunter Biden's time on the board of a natural gas company in the country.\n\nThe White House released a redacted transcript of the call in which Trump asked Zelensky to get Ukrainian prosecutors to probe Hunter Biden's business dealings, but Trump denied there was any threat of holding back military aid.\n\nFears the whistleblower's safety could be put in jeopardy if he is publicly identified have so far led to his name being kept a closely guarded secret among lawyers and House Democrats familiar with his allegations.\n\nThe move shows his legal team's concern over the whistleblower's identity, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe president has previously gone after the whistleblower, identified by the New York Times as a CIA officer, and demanded the right to face his accuser.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that House Democrats may interview the whistleblower at an off-site location to protect their identity, amid concerns it could leak.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky speaking during his day-long media marathon at a Kiev food court in which he denied there was any 'blackmail' over the infamous call with Trump\n\nTrump has accused the whistleblower of having ties to one of his political opponents\n\nMark Zaid, the lawyer who represents the anonymous whistleblower, said previously he was working to protect his client's identity.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter in September not long after the allegations came to light: 'We continue to work w/both parties in House & Senate and we understand all agree that protecting whistleblower's identity is paramount.\n\n'Discussions continue to occur to coordinate & finalize logistics but no date/time has yet been set.'\n\nAccording to reports the whistleblower has been detailed to the White House in the past and is said to have ties to Biden during his time as as vice president under the Obama administration.\n\nThe whistleblower has previously been identified as having a Democratic party affiliation.\n\nAn intelligence source said it is likely that the unnamed CIA analyst, who is clearly an expert on Ukraine issues, briefed Biden and may have even accompanied him on Air Force Two on one or more of the vice president's six visits to the country.\n\nOn Wednesday, attorneys for the CIA whistleblower issued a carefully-worded statement denying that the had a 'professional' link to a 2020 Democratic candidate, saying he is an apolitical civil servant.\n\nHis lawyers said they wanted to 'clarify some facts' and denied in a statement that the whistleblower made the complaint due to any political allegiance.\n\nBiden is seen with then-President Barack Obama signing executive orders to close down the detention center at Guantanamo Bay Cuba in 2009. Source say that Biden worked closely with the CIA whistleblower while serving as vice president\n\nZaid wrote on Twitter in a string of tweets: 'Our client has never worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign, or party.\n\n'Second, our client has spent their entire government career in apolitical, civil servant positions in the Executive Branch.\n\n'Third, in these positions our client has come into contact with presidential candidates from both parties in their roles as elected officials \u2013 not as candidates.\n\n'Fourth, the whistleblower voluntarily provided relevant career information to the ICIG in order to facilitate an assessment of the credibility of the complaint.\n\n'Fifth, as a result, the ICIG concluded \u2013 as is well known \u2013 that the complaint was both urgent and credible.\n\n'Finally, the whistleblower is not the story. To date, virtually every substantive allegation has been confirmed by other sources. For that reason the identity of the whistleblower is irrelevant.'", "description": "The\u00a0CIA officer at the heart of the Trump impeachment inquiry, who has not yet been named, has reportedly asked to submit written testimony to\u00a0Congress instead of appearing in person.", "authors": ["Chris Dyer For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/08/19577272-0-image-a-8_1570780565522.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
