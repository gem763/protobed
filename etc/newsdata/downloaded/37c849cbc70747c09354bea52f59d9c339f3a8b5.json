I don\u2019t think he should listen to all this negativity,\u2019 Whyte told IFLTV.\n\nJoshua and Ruiz Jr fight again in December (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018That\u2019s all nonsense. He needs to do his thing and do what he does best. What he does best is to be strong and aggressive and be on the offensive. That\u2019s what he does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Ruiz clocked him with a good punch, behind the ear, and he didn\u2019t recover. It\u2019s boxing. Everyone gets put on their arse sooner or later. Now it\u2019s his turn.\u2019\n\nJoshua has been inundated with suggestions since his shock defeat last June and his coach McCracken has faced a barrage of criticism.\n\nMcCracken has coached Joshua since he was amateur and Whyte backed the trainer amid calls for him to be axed.\n\nHe said: \u2018I believe in Rob McCracken. I believe Rob McCracken is a good trainer, took him a long way. Rob\u2019s a good trainer.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018He likes to work the basics. If you listen to Rob in his corner, he\u2019s telling him to stick to the basics and use the jab.\n\n\u2018He just needs to listen. If he uses his jab more against Andy Ruiz he knocks him out. He just needs to jab more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Doubles, singles and triples and he knocks Ruiz out. Ruiz is a tough guy. If you hit him with a right hand he takes it.\n\nJoshua is aiming to regain the world titles he lost (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018If you hit him with a couple of jabs, he doesn\u2019t see the right hand coming. Boom, that will be that.\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s be honest, Ruiz is a good fighter. He doesn\u2019t look it, but he\u2019s a good fighter.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s got quick hands but slow feet and that\u2019s why Joshua needs to use the jab.\u2019", "description": "Dillian Whyte believes Anthony Joshua will knock out Andy Ruiz Jr in their rematch if he deploys his jab more often.
