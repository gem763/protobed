The investment firm announced on Tuesday that starting October 7th, they will be eliminating their trading commission fees for US stocks, ETFs, and options.\n\nCharles Schwab shares closed down 9.73%, TD Ameritrade AMTD closed in the red by a whopping 25.83% for its worst day in 13 years, and E-Trade ETFC ended their day down over 16%. Founder and chairman, Charles Schwab, commented in a press release that the firm\u2019s \u201cpassion has been to make investing easier and more affordable for everyone\u201d after the announcement.\n\nWhy Cut?\n\nThe equity and fund trading landscape has changed substantially in recent years after the Silicon Valley startup, Robinhood, offered free stock trading back in 2013. Many investors were stoked at the opportunity to trade equities freely without having to account for trading commission costs. Charles Schwab\u2019s decision to eliminate commissions comes after their competitor, Interactive Brokers IBKR, announced last Thursday that their new product called IBKR Lite would allow users to trade US stocks and ETFs commission-free.\n\nFounded in 2012, Robinhood has garnered around 6 million users, many of them millennials, with its smartphone app that allows users to buy and sell stocks without fees. A Robinhood spokesman stated \u201cthe changes taking place across the brokerage industry reflect a focus on the customer that\u2019s been inherent to Robinhood since the beginning.\u201d How do brokerages like Robinhood make money? They rely heavily on a practice called \u201cpayment for order flow\u201d in which they route customers looking to buy or sell equities to electronic trading firms like Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial VIRT.\n\nThe evolving trading landscape has led financial giants like JPMorgan JPM to play along. The banking giant announced their You Invest product last year that was aimed at younger, first-time traders and offered customers at least 100 free stock or ETF trades a year. Charles Schwab CFO Peter Crawford said in a note on the company\u2019s website that \u201cIt has seemed inevitable that commissions would head towards zero, so why wait?\u201d\n\nMoving Forward\n\nBrokerage firms have already been hurting this year because of falling stock-trading volumes as concerns over slowed economic growth have run rampant throughout the market. The interest rate cuts dealt by the Federal Reserve in their July and September meetings have also hurt brokerages by cutting into their ability to collect interest on clients\u2019 cash. Wells Fargo WFC analysts expressed concern about the brokerage industry, stating, \u201cWe were hoping the challenging macro environment would prevent the industry from competing on price like this, but that is clearly not what is happening.\u201d\n\nCharles Schwab may be better positioned to weather the storm as it is more reliant on their banking arm and less dependent on commissions. Commission fees make up about 7% of total revenue for Charles Schwab while commission fees contribute about a quarter of TD Ameritrade\u2019s total revenue and roughly 20% of E-Trade\u2019s net sales. The last time Charles Schwab lowered its commission fee was in February 2017, and assets under management grew from $2.92 trillion to the current $3.72 trillion. Time will tell which financial service companies can successfully adapt to the contemporary trading landscape, especially as millennials grow older and possess more purchasing power.\n\nFree: Zacks\u2019 Single Best Stock Set to Double\n\n\n\nToday you are invited to download our just-released Special Report that reveals 5 stocks with the most potential to gain +100% or more in 2020.
