I can't find him anywhere!'\n\nThe new pictures come after Gemma's recent yoga session took a turn for the worse after she crashed her flashy BMW into a plant pot and smashed the car window earlier this month.\n\nThe TOWIE star, who had headed to a sunflower field for some much needed meditation, had to use some steady breathing after she reversed into the plant pot while leaving the car park.\n\nShe's off: Gemma drove off in her three-door Nissan Micra, which appeared to have some damage to the rear left panel\n\nThere she goes: Gemma struggled to carry all of her belongings to her car\n\nLet's go: Gemma was ready to leave, but needed to get her belongings packed away first\n\nFull to the brim: With her boot and back seat occupied with her belongings, the reality star put her bouquet on the front passenger seat\n\nGemma blamed the full moon for the disastrous crash and joked she was staying indoors for Friday 13th.\n\nTaking to Instagram, Gemma shared the catalogue of events which led to the smashed plant pot.\n\nIn one snap, the reality star, who was clad in a tie-dry tracksuit, looked blissfully relaxed as she did a yoga pose in a field of sunflowers before posing for a selfie.\n\nFormer career: If the star does plan to upgrade her BMW, it's likely she will get a good deal as she used to be a car salesperson before finding fame on the ITVBe show (pictured in 2011)\n\nCar salesperson: The reality star's first ever scene on TOWIE in 2011 was selling a BMW to Kirk Norcross as he tried to set her up with his father Mick (pictured in 2011)\n\nOh dear: The new pictures come after Gemma's yoga session took a turn for the worse after she crashed her flashy BMW into a plant pot and smashed the car window earlier this month\n\nSmash! The TOWIE star, who had headed to a sunflower field for some much needed meditation, had to use some steady breathing after she reversed into the plant pot while leaving the car park\n\nBut the next snaps showed Gemma's back seat covered in smashed glass and the plant pot smashed to smithereens, with the GC giggling in the driver's seat in the background.\n\nShe wrote: 'The FULL MOON is definitely affecting me already. I went from meditation sunflowers to smashing the glass on my car to reversing into a huge plant pot #fullmoonenergy #fullmoon .... what a day ....\n\n'I always feel very strange around a full moon does anyone else.
