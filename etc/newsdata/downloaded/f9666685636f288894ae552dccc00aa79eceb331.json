Many of those arrested have been charged and sentenced.\n\n\"This was one of the first times that law enforcement saw the use of cryptocurrency in trafficking child pornography,\" said US Attorney Jessie Liu.\n\n\"The site hosted more than a quarter million videos and users downloaded more than one million files,\" she said.\n\nDon Fort of the US Internal Revenue Service, which took part in the investigation, said it demonstrated that criminals can be tracked on the darknet and cannot conceal their identities behind cryptocurrency accounts.\n\n\"You went on the dark web, thinking that your actions were anonymous, but they weren't, and we found you,\" he told a press conference in Washington.\n\n\"Our agents have once again proved that there's nowhere that you can hide.\"", "description": "International law enforcement authorities announced Wednesday that a global investigation into child pornography sold for bitcoin on the underground internet had reaped 337 arrests and the shutdown of the dark web's most notorious pedophile site.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2050/09aa02ea245b4f9aba539c312bd95b57.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
