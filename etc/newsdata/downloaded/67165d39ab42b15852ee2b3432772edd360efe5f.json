Tactically, mentally, physically, they tore them to shreds.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s players and coaching staff, however, were avoiding the euphoria, well aware that defeat to South Africa or Wales in next weekend\u2019s final would put an entirely different complexion on Saturday\u2019s victory.\n\n\u201cGoing into the game, building up to it, we felt in control of what we\u2019re doing and that comes from our preparation,\u201d said captain Owen Farrell. \u201cThe work that we put in in the week - you can\u2019t fake that when you\u2019re out there in a big test match.\u201d\n\nFlanker Sam Underhill, who was again superb in forcing the All Blacks onto the back foot at the breakdown, said: \u201cYou have to celebrate your wins but we still have our feet on the ground. It\u2019s not something we\u2019re going to get carried away with.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spoken over the eight weeks about taking every day as it comes and not looking too far ahead and that\u2019s what we have managed so far. For us, it\u2019s just going to be a case of same again.\u201d\n\nHis similarly impressive flanker partner Tom Curry was equally grounded. \u201cYou have to take the occasion in and not let it pass you by but control is massive to our game and we have to make sure we deliver that again,\u201d said the 21-year-old. \u201cThe World Cup is such a fast-moving pace we have to shift our focus quickly onto South Africa or Wales.\u201d\n\nLock Maro Itoje, man of the match after another performance of astonishing energy, was also not about to sit on his laurels.\n\n\u201cI think I can be more engaged in the game, be more in the moment,\u201d he said of his own contribution. \u201cI think if I do that, hopefully I can still improve a little bit.\u201d\n\nJones, who lost the 2003 final to England when coach of Australia, declined to be drawn to comparing the performance and was fully focussed on the one remaining step.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not historians, we don\u2019t know, but we know we can play better next week,\u201d he said when asked where Saturday\u2019s match ranked.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to be the best team in the world and we\u2019re not yet. But now we\u2019ve got an opportunity to play in a game where we could be.\u201d", "description": "England's players woke up in their Tokyo Disneyland hotel on Sunday and recognised their amazing 19-7 semi-final victory over New Zealand was no fairy-tale but a performance based on meticulous preparation and superb execution.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445387769&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q061", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
