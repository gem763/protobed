The protests were sparked by a now-shelved extradition bill and have since snowballed into an anti-China movement.\n\n\u201cWe know that in the face of the world\u2019s largest totalitarian regime \u2014 to quote Captain America, \u2018Whatever it takes,\u2019\u201d Justin Leung, a 21-year-old demonstrator who covered his mouth with a black scarf, said of the violent methods deployed by hard-line protesters. \u201cThe consensus right now is that everyone\u2019s methods are valid and we all do our part.\u201d\n\nProtesters are planning to march again Tuesday despite a police ban, raising fears of more violent confrontations that would embarrass Chinese President Xi Jinping as his ruling Communist Party marks 70 years since taking power. Posters are calling for Oct. 1 to be marked as \u201cA Day of Grief.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo many youngsters feel that they\u2019re going to have no future because of the power of China,\u201d Andy Yeung, 40, said as he pushed his toddler in a stroller. \u201cIt\u2019s hopeless for Hong Kong. If we don\u2019t stand up, there will be no hope.\u201d\n\nHong Kong\u2019s government has already scaled down the city\u2019s National Day celebrations, canceling an annual fireworks display and moving a reception indoors.\n\nDespite security concerns, the government said Sunday that Chief Executive Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s leader, will lead a delegation of over 240 people to Beijing on Monday to participate in National Day festivities.\n\nSunday\u2019s turmoil started in the early afternoon when police fired tear gas to disperse a large crowd that had amassed in the popular Causeway Bay shopping district. But thousands of people regrouped and defiantly marched along a main thoroughfare toward government offices, crippling traffic.\n\nProtesters, many clad in black with umbrellas and carrying pro-democracy posters and foreign flags, sang songs and chanted \u201cStand with Hong Kong, fight for freedom.\u201d Some defaced, tore down and burned National Day congratulatory signs, setting off a huge blaze on the street. Others smashed windows and lobbed gasoline bombs into subway exits that had been shuttered.\n\nPolice then fired a water cannon and tear gas as the crowd approached the government office complex. Most fled but hundreds returned, hurling objects into the complex.\n\nMembers of an elite police squad, commonly known as raptors, then charged out suddenly from behind barricades, taking many protesters by surprise. Several who failed to flee in time were subdued and detained in a scene of chaos.\n\nThe raptors, backed by scores of riot police, pursued protesters down roads to nearby areas. Officers continued to fire a water cannon and more tear gas, and the cat-and-mouse clashes lasted late into the night. Streets were left littered with graffiti on walls and debris.\n\nThe demonstration was part of global \u201canti-totalitarianism\u201d rallies to denounce \u201cChinese tyranny.\u201d Thousands rallied in Taipei, Taiwan\u2019s capital, while more than 1,000 took part in a rally in Sydney.\n\nThe protracted unrest, approaching four months long, has battered Hong Kong\u2019s economy, with businesses and tourism plunging.\n\nChief Executive Lam held her first community dialogue with the public on Thursday in a bid to defuse tensions but failed to persuade protesters, who vowed to press on until their demands are met, including direct elections for the city\u2019s leaders and police accountability.\n\nEarlier Sunday, hundreds of pro-Beijing Hong Kong residents sang the Chinese national anthem and waved red flags at the Victoria Peak hilltop and a waterfront cultural center in a show of support for Chinese rule.\n\n\u201cWe want to take this time for the people to express our love for our country, China. We want to show the international community that there is another voice to Hong Kong\u201d apart from the protests, said organizer Innes Tang.\n\nMobs of Beijing supporters have appeared in malls and on the streets in recent weeks to counter pro-democracy protesters, leading to brawls between the rival camps.\n\nMany people view the extradition bill, which would have sent criminal suspects to mainland China for trial, as a glaring example of the erosion of Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nChina has denied chipping away at Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms and accused the U.S. and other foreign powers of fomenting the unrest to weaken its dominance.", "description": "Protesters and police clashed in Hong Kong for a second straight day on Sunday, throwing the semiautonomous Chinese territory\u2019s business and shopping belt...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS267_hkprot_ZG_20190929163912.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
