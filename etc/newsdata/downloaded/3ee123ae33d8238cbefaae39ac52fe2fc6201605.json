Ukraine. China. How far will Trump really go to sell out America\u2019s sovereignty to stay in office?\" tweeted Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat.\n\n\"The president of the United States encouraging a foreign nation to interfere and help his campaign by investigating a rival is a fundamental breach of the president's oath of office,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and outspoken Trump critic.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who authorized the impeachment inquiry last week, referenced Trump's comments in responding to a request by House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy to suspend the investigation.\n\nIn rejecting that suggestion, Pelosi replied to McCarthy that \"I received your letter this morning shortly after the world witnessed President Trump on national television asking yet another foreign power to interfere in the upcoming 2020 elections.\"\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he read Trump\u2019s statement as using the leverage of trade threats for personal gain.\n\n\u201cLinking trade negotiations to Donald Trump\u2019s wide-ranging effort to fabricate foreign accusations against political rivals is a complete abuse of the powers of the president,\u201d Wyden said.\n\nDemocrats say they are alarmed by a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky in which the president repeatedly pressed to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who once had business interests in Ukraine. Trump raised the requests after an extended conversation with Zelensky about U.S. aid to Ukraine the White House had delayed.\n\nTrump describes the call as \"perfect\" and has denied that the foreign aid was used as leverage to pressure Zelensky.\n\nLike the Ukraine call, Trump's remarks on China came within minutes of him raising U.S. power to punish its foes. Trump has often relied on a carrots-and-sticks approach in his trade policy, but his words Thursday took on new meaning for some critics given the ongoing scandal.\n\n\"If they don't do what we want,\" Trump said of China, \"we have tremendous, tremendous power.\"\n\nOthers pointed to Trump's controversial statement in 2016 when he hinted that Russia could \"find the 30,000 emails that are missing\" from Democrat Hillary Clinton's email server. Trump later explained away the comments as a joke, but Mueller's report noted Russian hackers targeted Clinton\u2019s personal office hours later for the first time.\n\nPresident Trump publicly called for China to launch an investigation into his leading Democratic rival, Joe Biden.
