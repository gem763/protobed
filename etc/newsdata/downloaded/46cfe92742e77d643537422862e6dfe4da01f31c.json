It will hurt her, but she deserves the truth.\n\n\"Also, I think it's a HUGE mistake to give it a week. You've said yourself she's never gonna confess it, so all you're doing is giving your dad and your aunt time to go to ground and map a strategy, maybe clean up the bank accounts and god knows what else.\"\n\nJordan seemed to take the advice by adding an update that the mum had been told, who has admitted she is in a toxic relationship and now wants out.\n\nThe aunt is staying in the town she works in, Jordan's dad is staying with his dad and 's*** is finally going down' - despite the beloved cheaters blaming the children for uncovering the whole thing.", "description": "The aunt deleted the conversation and denied the whole thing, but screenshots had already been taken and printed out as evidence", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20689032.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Concerned-woman-checking-bank-account-in-laptop.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
