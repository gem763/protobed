If they had listened to tenants\u2019 warnings, and dealt with the safety concerns raised, more people could have been saved.\n\n\u201cSo I say to both national and local governments \u2013 stop playing pass the parcel of blame.

Hundreds of buildings in the UK are still clad in similar material, and are likely to remain so for at least another 10 years.\n\nNo criminal charges relating to Grenfell have been made so far and, according to a statement from the Metropolitan Police in March this year, none are expected until 2021.\n\nThere has been a delay to the second phase of the inquiry, which will not now begin until January 2020 when it will focus on how Grenfell Tower was allowed to become such a risk to its inhabitants.\n\nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said:\n\n\u201cThe government has taken immediate action on public safety following the Grenfell Tower tragedy. We\u2019ve allocated \u00a3600m for the removal and replacement of dangerous ACM cladding on high-rise homes and are working with councils to ensure this work is completed.\n\n\u201cWe made clear that we agree with Dame Judith Hackitt\u2019s Independent Review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety. We said that we will take forward her recommendations and outlined plans to do so in the Building a Safer Future implementation plan, published in December 2018, which will bring in a tougher regulatory system for the future.\"", "description": "Austerity, deregulation and privatisation by consecutive governments bears ultimate responsibility for the Grenfell tragedy, the Fire Brigade\u2019s Union (FBU) has said.
