On Tuesday, she was \u201cretiring from the board\u2026 at the 2019 annual general meeting in November\u201d \u2013 November 19 to be particular.\n\nBut then on Friday, the following addendum: \u201cWiseTech Global confirms that in line with the previous announcement of non-executive director Christine Holman\u2019s intention to retire and not seek election at the 2019 AGM, Christine\u2019s resignation is effective from today.\u201d Which was simply not in line with the previous announcement.\n\nCompare this to Corporate Travel\u2019s former chairman Tony Bellas, who deferred his scheduled retirement in October last year to assist in responding to VGI Partners\u2019 short attack. In nearly identical circumstances, Holman has brought hers forward.\n\nBut is this a red flag, or just Christine being Christine?\n\nCast your mind back to August 15, 2017, when enterprise telco Vocus \u2013 at the time with KKR and Affinity in its data room, both yet to bail \u2013 announced the appointment of Holman as a director (effective August 24). \u201cChristine will join the audit committee and will sit on the board of [Vocus subsidiary] ASC International Group.\u201d\n\nThat was short-lived; a reverse David Crawford, if you will. \u201cChristine Holman has today resigned as a non-executive director, effective immediately,\u201d Vocus advised the ASX on November 13 of the same year. \u201cChairman Vaughan Bowen said, \u2018we thank Christine for her contribution to the company during her time as a director and wish her all the best.\u2019\u201d Her contribution? In just 81 days, her enlightened perspective was irrevocably forged in the corporation\u2019s DNA?\n\nHolman remains a director of vitamin house Blackmores, which she joined in April, and building products group CSR (a personal best, with her stint there having now ticked over three years). Apologies to Paul McCartney, but when they find themselves in times of trouble, she will flee...\n\nWiseTech shares will resume trading on Monday.", "description": "Is the departure of WiseTech's audit committee chair really a red flag, or just Christine Holman being Christine Holman?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0383%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/bcddcc6ea6c25b28fb7ec977ebf185ccae5062e6", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
