Dan Patrick defies NRA, says he supports background checks for private gun sales", "language": "en", "text": "Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick advocated for stronger gun background checks in sales between strangers, saying he\u2019s \u201cwilling to take an arrow\u201d and go against the National Rifle Association (NRA) to do so.\n\nInterested in Gun Control? Add Gun Control as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Gun Control news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nPatrick, in an interview with the Dallas Morning News, said Friday that \u201cnot expanding the background check to eliminate the stranger to stranger sale makes no sense to me and \u2026 most folks.\u201d\n\nPatrick, a staunch gun rights advocate who has in the past been endorsed by the NRA, added that \u201cpeople don't understand why we allow strangers to sell guns to total strangers when they have no idea if the person they're selling the gun to could be a felon, could be someone who's getting a gun to go commit a crime or could be a potential mass shooter or someone who has serious mental issues.\u201d\n\nHe said that gun sales between strangers are exempt from the requirement that the buyer be vetted through a federal database.\n\nPatrick still opposes background checks for gun sales among family members and friends, he said in the interview.\n\nJay Janner/Austin American-Statesman via AP\n\nThe NRA called Patrick\u2019s position \u201cpolitical gambits\u201d and said his \"'solution\u2019 precedes his possession of the facts.\"\n\n\u201cCriminalizing private firearms transfers would require a massive, government gun registration scheme. Instead of trampling the freedom of law-abiding Americans, the government should focus upon actual solutions: fixing our broken mental health system, prosecuting known criminals, and enforcing the existing gun laws that require follow-up whenever a prohibited person tries to buy a firearm,\u201d the NRA said in a statement.\n\nCalls for stronger gun laws have, once again, become part of the national discourse after recent high-profile mass shootings in the U.S., including in El Paso, Dayton and Odessa.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott recently signed eight executive orders in an effort to \u201cbetter protect\u201d communities after the mass shootings.\n\nThe orders included improving requirements for authorities when it comes to reporting suspicious individuals and making it easier for people to identify potential mass shooters. The objectives of the orders did not focus on guns.\n\nNumerous businesses, including CVS, Walgreens, Wegmans and Krogers, have asked customers to stop openly carrying their guns inside the stores.\n\nWalmart, the site of the El Paso shooting and another in Southaven, Mississippi, will now limit the sales of guns and ammunition. The change will reduce the chain\u2019s total U.S. market share of ammunition from 20% to between 6% and 9%, CEO Doug McMillon said in a company memo.", "description": "Texas. Lt. Gov.
