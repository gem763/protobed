She played an Aunt in a scene where a woman is ritually shamed by a group of handmaids for \u201cgetting herself\u201d gang raped at the age of 14. \u201cHer fault, she led them on,\u201d is the chant they use. Atwood says she found the scene \u201chorribly upsetting\u201d, although it was possibly not so wrenching to write as it was to enact or, later, for us to watch.\n\nIn the original book, a few deft sentences lead the reader, not into the magnetising shaming of another human being, but to the narrator Offred\u2019s insight into her own complicity. \u201cI used to think well of myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t then.\u201d The scene is moral, not sensational; it works through the brain, not through the eyes. This is one reason Atwood\u2019s work feels so ageless and necessary. She thinks.\n\nAtwood certainly has had an enormous amount to think about since her novel went supernova, not just as the hugely successful television adaptation, but as a powerful symbol of resistance to the misogyny of Donald Trump and the Christian rightwing. The series became a kind of visual enlargement of the agonies of the age, or the female agonies at least. It was sometimes hard to look, or to look away.\n\nIn The Testaments, Atwood reclaims the right to consider such difficulties rather than simply imagine them. She is interested not in how people become degraded, as objects (that is so easily done), but how they became morally compromised.\n\nThe novel picks up 15 or 16 years after Offred disappears to an unknown fate at the end of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. There are three narrators, two of them young and idealistic, one of them old and endlessly cunning. The most compelling portrait is that of wickedness \u2013 of course it is. The story is driven and described by the infamous Aunt Lydia, and she is just as terrifying, in her astringency, as you would expect her to be.\n\nIn Lydia\u2019s world view, people rise and fall by strength or weakness, and justice is a kind of theatre. \u201cInnocent men denying their guilt sound exactly like guilty men, as I am sure you have noticed, my reader.\u201d She appeals to the heartless survivor in all of us \u2013 at least this is what she seems to say, that when the chips are down, we will revert to our most primitive state. A crowd of imprisoned women is described as \u201ccrocodiles\u201d, ready to \u201cleap, thrash about and snap\u201d. Their first sighting of a mass execution does not dull their appetite for food, in fact it does the opposite: afterwards, Lydia is given an egg sandwich and, \u201cI am ashamed to say, I gobbled it up with relish\u201d.\n\nTo read this book is to feel the world turn\u00ading, as the unfore\u00adseeable shifts of recent years reveal the same themes\n\nHer induction into the order of Aunts is described with a chilling vigour. Tortured, imprisoned and tested, she is given a choice, and she chooses \u201cthe path most travelled by\u201d, one of compromise, betrayal and lies. The first book was good on the envy between women, when they have no power; The Testaments looks at collaboration \u2013 another vice of the oppressed. Lydia, however, collaborates as an equal, not as a victim; she is not in thrall. Indeed, she is happy to destroy women who have internalised the values of the patriarchal regime: one girl, Shunammite, is coldly sacrificed to her own silliness, a move that Lydia seems to enjoy.\n\nLydia may be in charge of the novel, but hers is not the only point of view. The younger women, introduced as Agnes and Daisy, have not lived a life of compromise, they do not remember the old days and they betray no one. Daisy is as bolshy and idealistic as any other teenager, Agnes is loyal and ready to love. The girls are courageous and hopeful and they venture out in the second half of the novel like the heroes of old. They believe in friendship: they even witness the perseverance, after death, of a person\u2019s soul.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aunt Lydia, right, in the TV adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.

People use computers, but the internet, that constant plot spoiler, has been more or less suppressed, and with it, the tendency of history to spin off into unlikely or cruel absurdities. Trump could not exist in this enclosed universe. Gilead was first imagined by Atwood after living in East Berlin before the fall of the wall. It is a place where people do not know things, including the sins of those in charge. Information is used at the end of the book as a liberating force rather than a randomising one. Authority exists, it has been centralised, and it can be overthrown.\n\nIn The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Offred refers, with amazing prescience, to \u201cfalse news\u201d: in The Testaments the news has turned \u201cfake\u201d. The word \u201cslut\u201d is more frequently employed, but otherwise there is no need to change what was, in 1985, so properly realised. As Atwood says, everything in this future dystopia has happened somewhere already, and Gilead owes much to the US\u2019s Puritan past. She is strong on idleness and good manners as weapons of oppression; for Atwood, perhaps the worst possible fate in life is to have nothing to do all day.\n\nAs a novel, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is held together by the sexual tensions between the characters. It is, among other things, a claustrophobic book about adultery, or one in which adultery has been turned to ritualised rape. The characters in The Testaments do not yearn and mourn as Offred did. They have, at the beginning of the book, been scattered by happenstance. This open, plot-driven novel brings them together in a way that owes less to Pinter\u2019s Betrayal, and more to a Shakespearean comedy of children lost and found.\n\nThe Testaments by Margaret Atwood \u2013 read the exclusive first extract Read more\n\nIn all this losing and finding, Aunt Lydia behaves as the novelist does, bringing people together for the purpose of plot, which in her case is also plotting. The novel is her conspiracy of one.\n\nSome Gilead facts invented by the readers make it into The Testaments. \u201cJune\u201d was chosen by fans as Offred\u2019s given name, and Atwood is happy to accept the suggestion. \u201cNicole\u201d, a baby who first appears in the TV series is, in The Testaments, nearly fully grown.\n\nYou might call this interleaving of book and reader postmodern, but there is more here than a posh writer\u2019s punning. Gilead, the fiction, is a kind of overgrown child. Atwood has taken it by the hand and made an open, free-running story, one that remains, as ever, deeply informed. In writing The Testaments, she also reclaims its world from all the people who think they own it now: the writers of fanfiction and the television producers (she told them they could not kill Lydia, apparently). A story that feels universal is, actually, hers: she gets to decide.\n\nPerhaps no other writer has managed her own phenomenon with so much grace and skill. The Testaments is Atwood at her best, in its mixture of generosity, insight and control. The prose is adroit, direct, beautifully turned. All over the reading world, the history books are being opened to the next blank page and Atwood\u2019s name is written at the top of it. To read this book is to feel the world turning, as the unforeseeable shifts of the last few years reveal the same old themes. It is also a chance to see your own political life flash in front of your eyes, to remember how the world was 30 years ago and say: \u201cIf she was right in 1985, she is more right today.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Anne Enright\u2019s The Green Road is published by Vintage.
