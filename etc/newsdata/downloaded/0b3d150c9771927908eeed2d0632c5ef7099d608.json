His son was off his medication, the father said, and had expressed a desire to buy guns and go on a shooting rampage.\n\nThe dad\u2019s call prompted police to track down the man, who the Star-Telegraph reported was \u201cwell known\u201d to local authorities. By then, he had already visited multiple businesses in an attempt to buy a gun, police said. He was repeatedly turned away, however, after failing background checks for reasons that are unclear.\n\nPolice said the man, carrying more than $600, had been trying to buy a gun on the street when they confronted him.\n\nWhen asked why he was seeking to buy a firearm, \u201che was just very flat and blunt \u2014 to kill people,\u201d said Officer Landon Rollins, a member of a Crisis Intervention Team that confronted the man, according to the Star-Telegraph.\n\n\u201cHe said, just, \u2018I want to kill people.\u2019 He reiterated this many times,\u201d Rollins added. \u201cHe was ... not living in reality.\u201d\n\nPolice in Fort Worth say they averted a potential mass shooting.\n\n\n\nThey said they received a call from a father who claimed his 27-year-old son wanted to buy guns and go on a rampage.\n\n\n\n\"He wanted to kill many people.\u201d https://t.co/4XEd17QqlH pic.twitter.com/fbtuSAXeKQ \u2014 Khary Penebaker, Fx (@kharyp) September 10, 2019\n\nAccording to NBC Dallas-Fort Worth, the man was later diagnosed with several mental health issues. As of Monday, he was reportedly at a clinic receiving treatment. Police didn\u2019t release the names of the father or the son.\n\nPolice praised the father for his courage to contact authorities.\n\n\u201cHe was extraordinarily worried and he feared a mass casualty incident,\u201d Rollins said, per NBC-DFW. \u201cThat takes so much courage to be able to do that on your own family and to reach out to law enforcement for that.\u201d\n\nA Fort Worth police spokesman said the man had apparently been inspired by the gunman who went on a deadly shooting spree in the Texas cities of Midland and Odessa last month.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to do something that was very similar that took place in the Midland-Odessa area and he basically wanted to mimic that,\u201d officer Buddy Calzada said.\n\nThe country has grappled with a slew of mass shootings in recent weeks. Earlier in August, 22 people were killed at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas; less than 24 hours later, a gunman massacred nine people outside a bar in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nThe Republican-led Senate has been facing increasing pressure from Democrats and others to take action on two gun background check bills in the wake of these shootings, including one that would close loopholes allowing private or online sales of guns and sales at gun shows without criminal background checks.\n\nIn Texas, background checks aren\u2019t required when guns are sold privately.\n\nBetsy Price, the Republican mayor of Fort Worth, is among the more than 200 mayors who have urged the Senate and the Trump administration to move on the legislation.\n\n\u201cBackground checks are nonpartisan and should be a no-brainer,\u201d Price told NBC-DFW this week", "description": "The 27-year-old man allegedly told police that he wanted to \"kill many people.\"", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d78b2b02300001c05512c54.jpeg?cache=xixdyjmpuk&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
