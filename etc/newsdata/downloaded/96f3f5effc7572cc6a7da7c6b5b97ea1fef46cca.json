That deal is said to be unaffected.\n\nSutter, who created The Sons of Anarchy, said in September last year he hung a letter about his 'unprofessional behavior' in his office.\n\nKurt Sutter has been fired from FX and will leave Sons of Anarchy spinoff Mayans M.C after 'multiple complaints' about his behavior, according to reports\n\nSutter was fired by FX CEO John Landgraf and Disney TV Studios and ABC Entertainment chairman Dana Walden. He posted this image and caption to Instagram overnight\n\nHe said: 'The reason why that letter was hung up in the first place and the reason why it's still there is not about like, 'f*** you, I'm a bad ass.' It's about, 'I'm a f***in' idiot and that behavior creates f***ing lawsuits.'\n\nIt is understood a decision was made over Stutter's future on Wednesday. He sent the letter to cast and crew Thursday, according to sources.\n\nSutter created Mayans along with Elgin James. He had already said James would be in control of day-to-day duties should it get a third season.\n\nHe said of that decision: 'It\u2019s time for the white man to leave the building.\n\n'If we are lucky enough to have a season 3, I will be stepping back as day to day showrunner and handing the reins to my talented and passionate partner, Elgin James.'\n\nSpeaking about the Disney takeover in September 2018 Stutter said: 'It was just a conversation about, \"This is the current climate. We don't suspect that you're going to sabotage anything, but we need to do the due diligence\".\n\n'And at first it was disconcerting because I'm like, \"What does that mean? Does it mean there's a new watchdog on my shoulder?\"\n\n'And it didn't mean any of that. It was basically, \"We know who you are, we know what you can do, we have to make sure that when new entities come in that we can vouch for [you]. And at the very least we can say we have had this conversation\".\n\nSons Of Anarchy starring Charlie Hunnam (left) and Ron Perlman was created by Kurt Sutter\n\n'Then there was, in a very politically delicate way, a \"Are there any skeletons in your closet that are gonna come back and bite us in the ass?\"\n\n'And I was like, \"Well, as far as I know, I didn't Weinstein anybody. I may have upset people, I may have said inappropriate things, but there was not [any of that].\"\n\n'But again, they needed to do the due diligence. And as Landgraf says, \"It's a different climate and you have to acknowledge it and be aware of it and move in step with it\".'", "description": "In a letter to the cast Sutter is said to have described himself as an 'abrasive d***', The Hollywood Reporter claims.", "authors": ["Lauren Fruen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/20/19854002-0-image-a-37_1571340846553.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
