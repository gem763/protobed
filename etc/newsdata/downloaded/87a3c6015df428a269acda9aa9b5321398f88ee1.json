The soft dressing contains tiny fibres extracted from birch trees grown in Finland which are strong enough to provide a \u2018scaffold\u2019 on to which healthy new skin cells can grow.\n\nThey are also super-absorbent so can mop up moisture from a wound that might otherwise allow bacteria to grow, leading to an infection.\n\nCalled FibDex, the tree-based bandage is the first of its kind to be approved for use in the UK. Research shows just one plaster is enough to help difficult wounds heal, whereas most dressings have to be changed every few days. The wood fibres also produced less scarring and greater skin elasticity \u2014 a sign of better healing \u2014 than some conventional dressings.\n\nA tree-based bandage called FibDex contains tiny fibres extracted from birch trees grown in Finland which are strong enough to provide a \u2018scaffold\u2019 on to which healthy new skin cells can grow (stock image)\n\nThe NHS spends \u00a35 billion a year on wound care \u2014 typically wounds occur on the foot or lower leg, as a result of circulation problems arising from diabetes. Starved of the oxygen they need to heal, these ulcers can form deep, open wounds that can take years to heal.\n\nIn their search for new ways to improve the healing process, scientists have turned their attention to wood \u2014 partly because it\u2019s biocompatible, which means it does not cause the body\u2019s immune system to react.\n\nIt is also a rich source of cellulose, a fibrous material used for decades in the production of clothing, paper, plastics and even explosives \u2014 the benefit for treating wounds is its absorbency.\n\nTRY THIS...

It also releases a chemical, called betulin, which stimulates the growth of healthy new skin cells to repair damage. So far the bandage, developed by researchers from Helsinki University and surgeons from Helsinki Burn Centre, has been tested on burns patients who needed major skin grafts. First a large patch of the patient\u2019s healthy skin \u2014 at least 6in (15cm) by 2in (5cm) \u2014 was removed from another part of the body and grafted on to the burned area.\n\nThis leaves a sizeable wound where the skin has been taken from \u2014 normally this is covered in a dressing that needs changing every few days.\n\nBirch tree extract has been used for centuries as a remedy for wounds. It also releases a chemical, called betulin, which stimulates the growth of healthy new skin cells to repair damage (stock image)\n\nThe results of a trial earlier this year involving 24 burns victims, published in Advances In Wound Care, showed the tree-based bandage healed the removal sites in two-and-a-half weeks, roughly the same as conventional dressings. But it also resulted in less scarring, a thicker layer of new skin \u2014 typically new skin that grows on a graft site is often thin and fragile \u2014 and less \u2018tightness\u2019 in the area, a common problem with large wounds after healing.\n\nOnly one bandage was needed, compared to several of the traditional ones, as the wood-fibre dressing is able to hold much greater volumes of moisture without becoming wet itself.\n\nProfessor Ash Mosahebi, a specialist in plastic surgery at the Royal Free Hospital London, said the wood bandage sounded promising but added: \u2018We need more data, especially for whether \u2014 as the manufacturer suggests \u2014 just one bandage really lasts the duration of the healing process.\u2019\n\nA patch containing pine bark extract may help with arthritis pain. In an independent study, 64 people with knee arthritis applied a patch twice daily containing 110mg of Pycnogenol, an extract of French maritime pine bark, for three weeks. A control group continued with normal care.\n\nThose using the bark had a 51 per cent improvement in their pain compared with 19 per cent in the control group \u2014 84 per cent of the control group needed painkillers while only 37 per cent of the pine bark group did. It\u2019s thought the extract has an anti-inflammatory effect. The pine bark group had lower levels of inflammatory markers in their blood, reports the Minerva Endocrinologica journal.\n\nTaking statins to lower cholesterol could reduce the risk of dementia by up to 60 per cent, according to research in the journal Medicine. The 12-year study, based on 100,000 people, found that those on statins had a five per cent lower risk than those not on them, and the larger the daily dose, the lower the risk.\n\nA good night\u2019s sleep may slash sweet cravings\n\nSleep loss can lead to weight gain as it increases our taste for sweet foods, reports a study in the journal Nutrients.\n\nResearchers measured the taste for sugar in 40 men and women after a normal night\u2019s sleep, and after sleep had been cut by 33 per cent.\n\nSleep loss increases our taste for sweet foods which can lead to weight gain (stock image)\n\nResults of the study at Michigan State University show that the taste for sugar was much higher after sleep had been cut short.\n\nThis lack of sleep is thought to have an effect on the brain chemical dopamine which is involved in the reward system, and in cravings and addiction.\n\nLack of sleep is thought to have an effect on the brain chemical dopamine which is involved in the reward system, and in cravings and addiction (stock image)\n\nHow healthy gums can lead to healthier skin\n\nRegular visits to the dentist may keep psoriasis at bay, dermatologists at Ohio State University suggest.\n\nPatients who ate fruit at least once a day were found to have milder symptoms of the inflammatory skin condition than patients who did not, their research indicates.\n\nHowever, poor gum health was linked to more severe symptoms of psoriasis.\n\nPoor gum health was linked to more severe symptoms of psoriasis, dermatologists at Ohio State University found (stock image)\n\nThe results, say the researchers, are thought to be related to levels of inflammation in the body.\n\nFruit is associated with lower levels, while gum disease increases them.\n\nDermatologists should urge psoriasis patients to improve their diet and oral health, the researchers wrote in the Dermatology Online Journal.\n\nCancer drugs link to heart damage Cancer survivors face a greater risk of heart problems than those who have never had cancer. A study conducted by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine found that people who had survived blood, oesophagus, lung, kidney and ovarian cancers were one-and-a-half times more likely to develop heart failure and heart muscle damage compared with those who have always been cancer-free. The study was based on more than 630,000 UK medical records \u2014 100,000 were the records of cancer survivors. The researchers suggest that the connection could be a side-effect of chemotherapy treatment, which damages healthy as well as cancerous cells, although more research is needed.\n\nMaking drugs\n\nThis week: Angina spray\n\nUsed to treat angina, glyceryl trinitrate, or GTN, is made of nitroglycerin \u2014 the explosive in dynamite. Taken in tiny amounts as a nasal spray, in a tablet that dissolves under the tongue or in a patch, it widens the blood vessels to the heart. This improves blood flow and eases the chest pain and tightness of angina.\n\nThe explosive\u2019s medicinal qualities were noticed by chance when the Italian chemist who discovered nitroglycerin experienced violent headaches. This was later attributed to the chemical making the blood vessels relax and by the mid-1870s, it was being used to treat angina.\n\nAlbert Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, was prescribed the chemical more than 100 years ago for his angina and nitroglycerin it is still a staple of treatment today \u2014 albeit under a different name.\n\nThe British Heart Foundation says: \u2018The name glyceryl trinitrate was chosen to avoid alarming patients.\u2019\n\nRUDE HEALTH\n\nFeminine hygiene products may do more harm than good. A 2018 study in BMC Women\u2019s Health found women who used \u2018intimate\u2019 gel sanitisers were 20 times more likely to have a bacterial infection than those who did not. The products may prevent growth of healthy bacteria needed to fight infections.\n\nSECRETS OF AN A-LIST BODY\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer, 61, wore a belt that accentuated her tiny waist to the premiere of Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil\n\nThis week: Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s waist\n\nMichelle, 61, wore a belt that accentuated her tiny waist to the premiere of her latest movie, Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil.
