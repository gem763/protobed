A so-called right-to-work state, South Carolina law forbids requiring union membership as a condition of employment.\n\nHarris -- who also spoke at the Blue Jamboree -- will reportedly meet privately with the workers at the conclusion of the event, according to The Hill.\n\nOther 2020 hopefuls who made appearances at the event included Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Ohio Rep. John Delaney and billionaire Tom Steyer.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "\u201cMcDonald\u2019s, they\u2019re pushing a myth,\u201d Harris said.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/06/0/0/Kamala.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
