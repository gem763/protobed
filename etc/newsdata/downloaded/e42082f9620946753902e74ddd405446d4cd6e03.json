Planemakers are typically reluctant to absorb such costs, the source added.\n\nAirbus declined to comment on commercial negotiations.\n\nOn a positive note, aircraft parts were spared from tariffs, which means independent repair shops, some feeling pain from the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX, will continue to function.\n\nThat will benefit Boeing and Airbus fleets equally, industry sources said.\n\nAIRLINES REACT\n\nDelta spokesman Lisa Hanna called on the Trump administration and EU to resolve the 15-year trade dispute \"in a manner that respects existing contractual rights\". Still, it welcomed Washington's decision to exempt aircraft production and deliveries from Airbus' plant in Mobile, Alabama.\n\nThe exemption means that the impact for US airlines with orders for Airbus aircraft assembled in Alabama can be mitigated, Cowen analyst Helane Becker said, pointing to no-frills carrier Spirit Airlines as one carrier whose order book would mostly come from Alabama.\n\nShares of US airlines rebounded on Friday after two days of losses.\n\nAirbus' Alabama plant produces four A320-family narrowbody jets a month, and Credit Suisse analyst Jose Caiado estimated that the plant could fulfill at least half of the US backlog over the next year at a rate of five jets per month.\n\nMost of budget-friendly carrier JetBlue Airways' orders for narrowbody A321s and A220s would also be among those exempt, but the carrier still warned of a hit to travelers and commercial aviation.\n\n\"We are concerned about the detrimental impact aircraft tariffs will have on the ability for low-cost carriers like JetBlue to grow and compete, which will harm customers who rely on us to offer competitive, low fares,\" spokesman Derek Dombrowski said.\n\nJetBlue continues to advocate for a resolution, he said.\n\nDelta and JetBlue, with the second-largest Airbus order among US carriers, had both lobbied for the tariffs to be applied only to new orders.\n\nDelta and United Airlines have the most orders for A350 and A330neo widebody jets, which Airbus cannot finish in Alabama. Widebody jets, with more premium seats, tend to have higher margins for airlines.\n\nJust last week Delta pledged to buy 14 more A350s as part of a strategy to grow in Latin America through the acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in LATAM Airlines Group.\n\nAmerican Airlines Group and Alaska Air Group also have Airbus orders, as do lessors like Air Lease.\n\nMost aircraft leases place the burden of taxes, maintenance and insurance on the operator, Macquarie analyst Sarah Stein said, but noted \"it is unclear as to how far reaching the definition of taxes are in lease agreements in a unique scenario such as this one\".\n\nThe head of Ireland's Ryanair urged the United States and European Union to pull back from a tariff war over aircraft subsidies and said he would ask Boeing to \"eat\" any counter-tariffs imposed on the US company by the EU.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Transport - [WASHINGTON] US airlines are scrambling to digest a new 10 per cent tariff on European-made Airbus planes that threaten additional havoc in a market already reeling from frozen deliveries of Boeing's 737 MAX. .
