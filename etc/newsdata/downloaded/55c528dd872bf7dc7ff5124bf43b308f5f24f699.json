Officials alleged AdvoCare falsely claimed to offer \u201ca life-changing financial solution that would allow any ordinary person to earn unlimited income, attain financial freedom and quit their regular job.\u201d\n\nAdvoCare\u2019s pyramid scheme pushed distributors to focus on recruiting other distributors instead of selling products to customers, FTC officials said in the complaint. To recruit people, AdvoCare and its top distributors told other distributors to make exaggerated claims about how much money average people could make. They also told distributors to make emotional stories about how the company saved them from financial struggles and to make potential recruits worry about missing out of they didn\u2019t join.\n\nHowever, \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of AdvoCare\u2019s distributors actually earn no money or even lost money through the company\u2019s multi-level marketing system, according to the complaint. In 2016, 72.3 percent of AdvoCare distributors earned zero compensation from the company, and another 18 percent made $250 or less.\n\n\u201cLegitimate businesses make money selling products and services, not by recruiting,\u201d said Andrew Smith, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. \u201cThe drive to recruit, especially when coupled with deceptive and inflated income claims, is the hallmark of an illegal pyramid. The FTC is committed to shutting down illegal pyramid schemes like this and getting money back to consumers whenever possible.\u201d\n\nAdvoCare said it cooperated with the FTC\u2019s investigation but disagreed with the commission\u2019s conclusions.\n\n\u201cWe strongly disagree with the FTC allegations, but we are committed to abiding by this agreement and moving forward,\u201d CEO Patrick Wright said in a written statement. \u201cThe strength of AdvoCare is and always has been our highly-valued health and wellness products, which remain in great demand by our hundreds of thousands of loyal customers.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the $150 million payout, the settlement bans AdvoCare from using multi-level marking and requires the company notify its distributors that they will no longer be able to earn compensation based on purchases in their downline but that they can get a refund on unused products, according to the FTC.\n\nAdvoCare said it revised its business model earlier this year to switch from a multi-level marketing model to a single-level compensation plan.\n\nDistributors with \u201csignificant losses\u201d may be able to get some of their money back from the FTC, the commission said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "The settlement bans the company from using multi-level marketing to sell its products.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/lawyer-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
