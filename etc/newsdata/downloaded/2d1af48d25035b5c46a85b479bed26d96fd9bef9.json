One clue that they were operating came in the form of a cryptic Reddit post that turned out to be a secret signaling mechanism for the spies\u2019 malware.\n\nAlso called \u201cCozy Bear\u201d and \u201cAPT29,\u201d the Dukes have been linked to Russia\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Service, the SVR. They\u2019re stealthy, sophisticated operators best known as the other Russian hackers in the DNC\u2019s network\u2014the ones who lurked quietly, undetected by the Democrats, for nearly a year before the GRU\u2019s hackers barged in to carry out Putin\u2019s 2016 election interference plan.\n\nIn January 2017, as global concern about Russia\u2019s state-sponsored hacking swelled, the Dukes vanished. A phishing campaign that month against the government of Norway became the last hack attack strongly linked to the group.\n\nA year later, a Dutch newspaper detailed a remarkable years-long counter-hack against the Dukes in the years before they went dark. The Dutch intelligence agency AIVD broke into the Dukes\u2019 network in 2014, and spent years watching the Russians, at one point literally eyeballing them through the security cameras in the Moscow university the Dukes were operating from. From their privileged perch, the Dutch relayed information to U.S. officials in real time to help thwart the Dukes\u2019 breach of U.S. State Department systems, and then tipped off the U.S. again when the Dukes hit the DNC in 2015. (The FBI later passed the warning to the DNC, which didn\u2019t initially take it seriously). Experts speculated the Dukes had been shut down or were busy regrouping in the wake of unwanted publicity and the embarrassing Dutch counter-hack.\n\nBut a report Thursday by researchers at the European security firm ESET concludes that the Dukes never went away at all\u2014they just retooled, developing new harder-to-spot versions of their custom malware. Based on code similarities, a common custom encryption algorithm and other indicators, ESET said it\u2019s linked the Dukes to a continuous chain of hacks dating back to 2013, and still going on as of last June.\n\n\u201cWe spent months apparently chasing a ghost then, a few months ago, we were able to attribute several distinct intrusions to the Dukes,\u201d reads the report by ESET researchers Matthieu Faou, Mathieu Tartare and Thomas Dupuy. The Russians\u2019 targets, according to the report, include three unnamed European foreign affairs ministries and an unnamed European embassy in Washington, D.C.\u2014all typical targets for cyber espionage.\n\nThe Dukes\u2019 creative opsec is one reason they\u2019ve stayed invisible for so long. The hackers often use coded messages broadcast on Twitter or dropped on Dropbox to communicate with their hacked machines secretly in plain sight, even posting steganographically-coded photos on public image boards.\n\nESET\u2019s research adds Reddit to the list of sites co-opted into cyber espionage. The researchers identified two accounts dating to 2014 that were created for the sole purpose of posting coded messages on subreddits, including the r/funny humor board. The hackers\u2019 malware would check for new posts and decrypt a seemingly-nonsensical word in the comment to get the website address of one of the Dukes\u2019 command-and-control servers.\n\nThe takeaway, ESET said, is that state-sponsored hackers \u201cgoing dark for several years does not mean they have stopped spying. They might pause for a while and re-appear in another form, but they still need to spy.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
