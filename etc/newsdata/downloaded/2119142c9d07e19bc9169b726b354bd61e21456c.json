(Pictured: Dame Helen Mirren in the series)\n\nShe is also related by marriage to the Tolstoys \u2014 and her great-great-great-great-grandfather, Field Marshal Mikhail Kamensky, actually served under Catherine the Great. (Left, Helen Mirren at the 'Isle of Dogs' premiere last year and right, Helen Mirren in the series)\n\nInstead, she grew up in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, in a suburban semi with no central heating and ice on the inside of the windows in winter. She was the middle of three children of a cab driver father and a mother who was five years his senior and the 13th of 14 children.\n\nIn contrast, her great-grandmother, Lydia, was the daughter of Count Andrei Kamensky, a landowner and nobleman, and her grandfather, Pyotr Vasilievich Mironov, grew up with his six sisters in aristocratic luxury.\n\nWhile the sisters enjoyed a cosseted life shuttling between Moscow and their home at Kuryanovo, a sprawling family estate in Smolensk, on the border with Belarus, Pyotr joined the army.\n\n\u2018He was a proud and loyal member of the Tsarist army,\u2019 according to Dame Helen.\n\nHe was also bright and rose rapidly through the ranks. By World War I, he was an emissary to the last tsar, Nicholas II, and, in 1916, he was sent as part of a small delegation to London to negotiate an arms deal with the British.\n\nHer great-grandmother Lydia was the daughter of Count Andrei Kamensky, a landowner and nobleman, and her grandfather Pyotr Vasilievich Mironov, grew up in artisocratic luxury\n\nHe took his wife, Marusia, and their children, Irina, five, Vasily, three, and baby Olga, but they travelled light: just two pictures of the tsar and tsarina, Pyotr\u2019s typewriter, a few roubles and his wooden trunk.\n\nThey didn\u2019t need much luggage because, as honoured guests and representatives of the tsar, they would be feted by the British Government and housed in luxury at the Russian Embassy.\n\nBut that all ended in 1917, when the Russian Revolution wiped out the old order and aristocrats, including the Mironovs, were stripped of their land and homes.\n\nIn London, the young family were stranded. Pyotr knew they could never return home without risking Lenin\u2019s firing squads.\n\nUsed to extreme riches, they had no money, very few clothes and nowhere to live. So Pyotr took the only work he could find with his halting, heavily accented English \u2014 a taxi driver. \u2018My grandfather embraced his army life and his taxi driving with the same grace and style,\u2019 Mirren has said.\n\nHer grandfather travelled to Britain with his family to be guests of the British Government\n\nIn his new life, he clung to the old via letters exchanged with his sisters (until they stopped arriving during the Stalinist purges of the Thirties and Forties) and via the tales of grand houses, stables and sprawling estates with which he regaled his granddaughter, Ilyena (Helen), as he bounced her on his knee.\n\n\u2018It was always me he told the stories to,\u2019 she has said.\n\nHelen\u2019s father, Vasily, who as a young boy was pictured on a chaise longue in a velvet tunic with a lace collar, was just as resourceful.\n\nHe earned a living playing the viola and working in a textile warehouse in London\u2019s East End. Later, after he met and married Helen\u2019s mum, an East Ender called Kit, whose grandfather had been a butcher for Queen Victoria, they moved to Leigh-on-Sea and he drove a taxi like his father.\n\nBut while he adored his wife and three young children, he always felt an outsider and wanted his family to feel properly British. He never spoke of the past, and when Helen was ten, he anglicised their names.\n\nVasily Mironov became Basil Mirren and his children became Katherine, Helen and Peter, as he progressed from cabbie to driving instructor to civil servant in the Ministry of Transport, while his middle child started her acting career in school plays and later drama school in London.\n\nHowever, following the 1917 revolution, they were stripped of their land and homes. The young family were left stranded in London with no money, very few clothes and nowhere to live - so Pyotr became a taxi driver. (Pictured: Lydia Andreevna Kamenskaya)\n\nHelen's father Vasily was pictured as a young boy sitting on a chaise longue wearing a velvet tunic with a lace collar. (Pictured: A display of letters from Princess Kamenskaya to Count Sergey in Russia)\n\nBy the age of 25, she was being hailed as the best thing to come out of Southend.\n\nDespite her English upbringing, Dame Helen has said she still sometimes feels an outsider and \u2018very Russian\u2019, particularly when she is feeling low.\n\nIf there is a melancholia in the family for what might have been, it is hardly surprising. Neither her father nor grandfather returned to Russia before they died.\n\nIndeed, Helen was the first Mironov to visit their homeland, on a cultural exchange visit in the late-Sixties, when she was already an established actress at the Royal Shakespeare Company.\n\nIt was an official trip with very close Soviet supervision, though, and she had no opportunity to trace the old family estate or relatives.\n\nIt was only when her mother died in 1996 that Helen found her grandfather\u2019s old wooden trunk, full of letters from his sisters in tiny writing on yellowing paper.\n\nThe 74-year-old became the first Mironov to visit her homeland through a cultural exchange in the late-sixties, when she had already become an established actress\n\nThe trip was official, and had very close Soviet supervision, however. (Pictured: Helen Mirren with Andrew Marr in Manchester last month)\n\nAt the time, she was grieving for her mother and busy with her career, so she put them to one side. It was another ten years before she sent them to a translator and the Mironov family history was finally revealed. The letters inspired a Radio 4 drama (in which Helen starred as her great-aunt Ilyena) and a trip to Moscow, during which she tried, and failed, to find traces of the family home or any surviving relatives.\n\nDevastated, she concluded that her family had been wiped out in Stalin\u2019s Gulags.\n\nBut the hunt was not over. In 2005, a Russian-based journalist started digging and the following year discovered that, while the family land was indeed all gone, Helen\u2019s great-aunts had somehow survived Stalin.\n\nAfter being thrown out of their home by the Bolsheviks, Helen\u2019s great-grandmother Lydia and her six daughters moved to Moscow, where three of the sisters \u2014 Lydia, Valentina and Antonina \u2014 married.\n\nThe other three \u2014 Ilyena, Zinaida and Ksenia \u2014 remained spinsters and lived with their mother until her death in 1928 in a cramped, windowless flat in the capital. They worked, went to the theatre and read to each other, but it was a hard life.\n\nBy the time Germany invaded Russia in 1941, the sisters were growing old and, despite the harsh conditions and severe food rationing, decided to stay in Moscow.\n\nDame Helen Mirren photographed acting in the production Caligula in 1979\n\nZinaida and Antonina died during the war, and Pyotr\u2019s favourite sister, Ilyena, died four years later, aged 79. Ksenia lived until 1962 and Lydia until 1965. The last sister to die was Valentina, in 1981, aged 90.\n\nBut there were descendants. The sisters who had married had children and grandchildren, so Helen and her siblings had cousins.\n\nIn 2007, Helen and her sister Kate returned to Russia. They stood on the edge of a thick wood on the former estate where the family home had once been, and planted three rose trees (the estate had once been full of roses) in memory of their great-grandmother.\n\nThen finally, in Moscow, they met their Russian relatives and wept. \u2018I hadn\u2019t expected to feel so close to them so quickly, but there was a real sense of family,\u2019 Helen said.\n\nWith her deep Russian roots, no wonder this most acclaimed of British actresses was so delighted at the chance to play the extraordinary woman who transformed her father and grandfather\u2019s country.", "description": "Dame Helen Mirren was destined to play the Russian Empress that juggled international aggression with art collecting, writes Jane Fryer.
