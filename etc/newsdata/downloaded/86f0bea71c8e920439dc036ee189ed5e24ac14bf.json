(DHFL) outside its office on the outskirts of Mumbai, India, January 31, 2019. REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India\u2019s Dewan Housing Finance Corp Ltd (DHFL) filed long-delayed audited results for the quarter ended June 30 on Thursday showing the company under financial stress as fresh loan disbursements stopped.\n\nOne of India\u2019s biggest housing finance companies, DHFL posted a net loss of 2.06 billion rupees ($28.96 million) during the quarter compared with a profit of 4.35 billion rupees ($61.15 million) in the same period a year earlier.\n\nThe Central Depository Services had frozen DHFL\u2019s promoter shareholding after the company did not report results for the first quarter of FY20 in the stipulated time.\n\n\u201cThe Company is undergoing substantial financial stress since (the) second half of the previous financial year,\u201d the management said.\n\nIt said a rating downgrade to \u201cdefault\u201d earlier this year had hit the company\u2019s ability to raise funds and lending operations.\n\nBankers have said DHFL owes almost 1 trillion rupees ($14.05 billion) as debt to banks, mutual funds and insurance companies. The banks are working on a resolution plan to restructure the loans given to DHFL to ensure it survives.\n\nThe proposed plan involves conversion of debt into equity for lenders and also includes giving them a 51% stake in the company. The lenders are likely to vote on the resolution plan soon, Rajkiran Rai, chief executive officer of Union Bank, said on Wednesday, without providing a time frame.\n\n($1 = 71.1850 Indian rupees", "description": "India's Dewan Housing Finance Corp Ltd (DHFL) filed long-delayed audited results for the quarter ended June 30 on Thursday showing the company under financial stress as fresh loan disbursements stopped.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441955709&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G1QM", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
