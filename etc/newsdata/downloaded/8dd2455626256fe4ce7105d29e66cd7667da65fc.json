The US has said the Houthi rebels, who are the subject of a military operation being carried out by Saudi Arabia and supported by the US and UK, were not equipped for such a type of attack.\n\nIran, meanwhile, has denied the claims, and accused the US of warmongering. It had been anticipated Donald Trump would meet with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani at the UN General Assembly later this month. That now seems unlikely to happen.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6086824440001\n\nDonald Trump on Iran: \u2018I don\u2019t want a war but US is more prepared than any country\u2019\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Trump told reporters: \u201cI never rule anything out, but I prefer not meeting him.\u201d\n\nUS media, including CNN, has quoted anonymous US officials as saying the attacks originated in Iran.\n\nThree officials told Reuters the attack was launched from Iran\u2019s southwest, and that it involved both cruise missiles and drones. The officials did not provide evidence or detail the US intelligence they used to make the assessments.\n\nIn a sign that some US allies remain unconvinced, French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said he was unsure if anyone had any evidence to say whether drones \u201ccame from one place or another\u201d.\n\nRelations between the United States and Iran have deteriorated since Mr Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear accord last year and reimposed sanctions on its oil exports.\n\nFor months, Iranian officials issued veiled threats, saying that if Tehran were blocked from exporting oil, other countries would not be able to do so either.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies\n\nRead more\n\nTory minister sorry for \u2018accidentally\u2019 allowing illegal military sales\n\nWill jump in oil prices from strikes on Saudi Arabia affect consumers?\n\nOil prices soar after attack wipes out half of Saudi oil production\n\nTrump must consider attack on Iran, Lindsay Graham urges", "description": "Saudi Arabia has announced that oil production will be restored to normal by the end of the month, as the US insisted Iran was behind the weekend attack on a facility that shock the kingdom and sent prices soaring.Energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said on Tuesday average oil production in September", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/X4m43AIOqzRvpTqgDiFyQg--~B/aD0zNjc7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/b7677b9933cf098a699496e91bac7bbe", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
