The Patriots, meanwhile, have taken 16 of the last 19 division titles since Bill Belichick was named head coach for the 2000 season.\n\nGundlach, the CEO and chief investment officer of the Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital, which has $140 billion in assets, says the team is looking much improved this year.\n\nHe says quarterback Josh Allen has taken a step forward, but concedes Allen needs to get rid of the ball faster.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere was one play on Sunday that I counted when they showed the replay he held the ball for 12 seconds -- 12 seconds,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the rule in the NFL is 4.5 seconds, you gotta get rid of that ball.\u201d\n\nGundlach is excited about receivers John Brown and Cole Beasley, whom the team signed in the offseason, and third-year wideout Zay Jones. But the player he's been most impressed with is rookie tight end Dawson Knox.\n\n\u201cI mean we haven't had a tight end in Buffalo that's been worth anything for years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you saw Knox, where he just completely steamrolled this guy that was coming in to put a big hit on him and he just blew the guy up.\u201d\n\nAs for Sunday, he thinks the Bills will hang tight in the first half, but could have trouble keeping up in the second half because Bellichick is a master at mixing up his game plan. Still, he says the Bills have one advantage over Bellichick and the Patriots.\n\n\u201cThe one thing about the Bills, which I think is going to play to their advantage against Belichick, is Belichick loves figuring out who your most important player is and making sure they are taken out of the game through his strategic plan,\u201d Gundlach said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s better at that than any other coach, and the Bills don\u2019t have that. They don\u2019t really have that guy that everything revolves around, and for that reason it might be challenging.\u201d\n\nOne player Gundlach doesn\u2019t want to see on the Bills is Antonio Brown, the wide receiver who was recently released by the Patriots following allegations that he sexually assaulted and raped his former personal trainer. Brown has denied the claims.\n\n\u201cAntonio Brown would be kind of that guy you gotta take out of your game plan,\u201d Gundlach said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a guy like that.\u201d\n\nAs an example, he pointed to LeSean McCoy, who the team released before the season. McCoy gained more than 5,100 yards and scored 40 touchdowns in four seasons with the Bills, but the team only made it to the playoffs once.\n\n\u201cWhen the Bills succeed, there\u2019s something about the mentality of the locker room, the mentality of the types of players that somehow sinks in with the mentality of the city,\u201d Gundlach said.\n\n\u201cAnd there's this kind of weird serendipity and that's certainly happened in the early '90s. And I think it's happening now and I don't think that Antonio Brown is accretive to that to that direction.\u201d\n\nAs for who wins the game on Sunday, Gundlach hedged his bet.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s a seven-point spread or something on the game,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the Bills win, or the Patriots will win by significantly more than seven.\"", "description": "The undefeated Buffalo Bills host the undefeated New England Patriots in an AFC East showdown.", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Jeff-Gundlach-Buffalo-Bills-Getty-002.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
