It had been five years.\n\n\"He wanted to apologise for the way it ended before. And I needed a damn friend. I felt like the whole world was laughing at me.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nAt the time they rekindled, Lil Wayne was expecting a son - Dwayne Carter III, 10, with his ex girlfriend Sarah Vivian, 32.\n\nAnd the Grammy-nominated artist was already a dad to daughter Reginae, 20. He shares her with ex Antonia Wright.\n\nNivea had three kids from her marriage to Terius - daughter Navy, 14, and twin sons London and Christian, 13.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nBut knowing that Lil Wayne had a child on the way didn't stop the singer from accepting his second proposal in 2009.\n\nShe admitted it didn't bother her that he was expecting another child by another woman as it was conceived while they weren't together.\n\nNivea recalled: \"When we reconnected, I had three [kids].\n\n\"I wasn\u2019t pregnant. That's not the reason he proposed to me or anything like that. I took it for, 'You accepted mine.'\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\"If this occurred before us and we're just now getting back to it, why wouldn't I accept that son if you're telling me you want to marry me? So that was that.\"\n\nAs their relationship progressed, the star found out she was pregnant with their fourth child, Neal, who is now 9.\n\nBut during her pregnancy, she decided to call it a day with Lil Wayne and ended the relationship.\n\nNivea also lost her mother, and admitted it helped her form a bond with Lauren London.\n\nShe added: \"You can't take nothing back. So we are the best mothers that I've ever seen in a group with the same baby father. I think it's amazing.\"", "description": "She spoke about her ex Lil Wayne and the amazing friendship she has with his ex Lauren London", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "Instagram", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article11107615.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Lil-Wayne-performs-during-the-2015-iHeartRadio-Music-Festival-at-the-MGM-Grand-Garden-A.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
