It\u2019s made out of teff, the smallest grain in the world, and it doubles as both a plate and silverware in many Ethiopian meals.\n\nMedha: Woo!\n\nRomeo Regalli: There you go, look at that!\n\nMedha: Oh my god!\n\nMedha: Today, we\u2019re going to explore injera and Ethiopian cuisine in general with my friend Rania, who\u2019s originally from Ethiopia. I\u2019m really excited, we\u2019re gonna head to one of the few places in Brooklyn that serves this cuisine, so let\u2019s take a look. But before we do, here\u2019s a little information that you need to know.\n\nMedha: Originating in what is now Ethiopia and Eritrea, injera is thousands of years old. The strongest evidence of injera cooking dates back to at least 600 AD, when the first mitads, or traditional round hot plates, were found in excavations of the ancient city of Aksum. Today, injera is the base of nearly every Ethiopian meal and is typically topped with numerous vegetable and meat dishes. It starts off with teff, a nutritious, gluten-free grain originally grown in the highlands of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Awash, an Ethiopian restaurant, is one place that serves injera and Ethiopian cuisine in New York City.\n\nMedha: So, we\u2019ve made our way to Awash in Brooklyn, and I\u2019m here with my friend Rania, who is originally from Ethiopia. Rania, thank you for joining us.\n\nRania Sheikh: Thank you for having me. I am super excited that we\u2019re gonna try some Ethiopian food today.\n\nMedha: Awesome. So, we\u2019re gonna try those out today, and let\u2019s go inside.\n\nRania: Let\u2019s do it. Medha: We met up with Awash\u2019s co-owners and partners, Romeo and Milka Regalli. Romeo hails from Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, and Milka grew up in a predominantly Ethiopian community in the Bronx.\n\nRomeo: When people go to an Ethiopian restaurant, they have to go with an open mind. You have to be open to try different things; you have to be open to eating with your hands.\n\nMilka Regalli: So, this is the batter, and we\u2019re just gonna make injera. You mix it with water to create this batter, let it ferment for about three days, and then we use the mitad, which is a flat pan, it\u2019s about 500 degrees, to make the injera.\n\nMedha: Underneath, the injera cooks from the bottom while small holes begin to dot the surface.\n\nMilka: Injera is naturally gluten-free. What we serve here is a mix of gluten and teff.\n\nRomeo: The reason why we mix it with wheat flour is because teff is very expensive. We would be out of business if we just serve teff. But we do provide that for people who, you know, ask for it.\n\nRania: The gluten-free part is pretty funny because I think Ethiopian food has become so mainstream because of the gluten-free aspect of injera, but also because so much of the main dishes are actually also vegetarian. So, it\u2019s, like, gluten-free. It\u2019s vegetarian. It\u2019s basically every, like, millennial\u2019s dream.\n\nRomeo: Right. Medha: This looks a little different than some of the injera I\u2019ve had before. It\u2019s, like, a darker colour.\n\nRomeo: Because that\u2019s the 100% teff.\n\nMedha: Oh!\n\nRania: So good.\n\nMedha: Mm. Once cooked, injera is topped with vegetable and meat dishes like yater kik alecha, made from yellow split peas; gomen, a stew of collard greens; atakilt, a mix of cabbage, carrot, and potatoes; shiro, a spicy chickpea dish; and doro wot, a chicken dish cooked with ginger, garlic, hard-boiled eggs and berbere, an Ethiopian blend of 30 different spices.\n\nMedha: Woo! Romeo: There you go, look at that!\n\nMedha: Oh, my God! That looks amazing.\n\nRomeo: And then I\u2019ll bring the injera on the side. All right?\n\nRania: Perfect.\n\nRania: If you want something, in Ethiopian cuisine, you wouldn\u2019t say I wanna eat injera, you would say I wanna eat shiro, or kikil, or misir, or doro wot, and then, the assumption is it comes with injera. Right? So it\u2019s like if you say I want a turkey sandwich, it comes in a sandwich, or in bread. All right. So, basically, as you can see, it\u2019s all on one giant plate, and you can see all the different little foods that we cooked earlier, and you take some fresh injera, cut a little piece, and then start digging. So good.\n\nMedha: Satisfaction.\n\nRania: So, typically, when you scoop something up you just wanna scoop it with the injera without touching the actual sauce, and if you successfully scoop it you just put the injera on top and you grab from the corner, and you just pick it right up, and it\u2019s like a little triangle in your hand. And then when you eat it, you eat it in a way where you\u2019re not putting your hand in your mouth, really, you\u2019re just kinda dropping the injera in your mouth.\n\nMedha: OK. Rania: So it\u2019s like\u2026\n\nMedha: Oh, OK, I\u2019m gonna scoop it. Like this, right?\n\nRania: Pretty good to me. So, what\u2019s the verdict?\n\nMedha: It\u2019s so good. Immediately after the shiro taste, you could taste the sourness of the injera itself.\n\nRania: Yeah. Sometimes in Ethiopian culture, people would, like, pick up, like, a bit of food in their hands and then they would feed it to someone else, and it\u2019s called gursha, but it\u2019s a sign of love and respect. You do this to someone you love. The Ethiopian culture is generally very community-based, so when you eat like this on one giant plate with all of your family members, it\u2019s because you\u2019re pretty close. It\u2019s supposed to mix, that\u2019s why they\u2019re all on the same plate. How is that?\n\nMedha: It\u2019s really good.\n\nRania: Towards the end of your meal, what you usually do is, you start scooping the injera that\u2019s on the plate. So, you see how this is, like, a little bit soggy? Because it\u2019s been soaking up all the spices and all the water from the lentil and all the other sauces on the plate. So, eventually, if you\u2019re doing this right, your plate should be totally empty and all the injera that\u2019s on the plate should also be eaten.\n\nMedha: That\u2019s awesome. I think I\u2019m filling up, and I\u2019ve had such a great time eating this with you and learning so much more about injera and just the Ethiopian community in general. Thank you for joining me.\n\nRania: Me too, thank you so much for having me. And thanks for letting me eat some food. I think I\u2019m gonna quit my day job and join you. I\u2019m just kidding, I\u2019m not gonna quit my job.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
