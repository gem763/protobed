So it's good news for British Gas customers, as the energy provider has just announced that its giving some of its subscribers a ten days of electricity for free. Yes, really.\n\nTo get yours, you'll need to have the British Gas app downloaded and head to the rewards section, where you should see it in a list of current offers to claim.\n\nSadly, for everyone thinking of spending their ten complimentary days using all the free electricity, sadly, it just takes an average daily price for your usage over the period and deducts that. So you won't get specific free days where you can just turn everything on and use as much as you like... Gutted.\n\n(Image: HotUKDeals)\n\nOnce you've selected the offer, you'll get a notification saying it's been added to your account, with the ten free days of electricity automatically taken off your next bill.\n\nOriginally spotted on deals forum HotUKDeals by a user named 'mbeischer86', the deal is apparently loading on most accounts, although a few select accounts are sadly unable to see it right now.\n\nWe contacted British Gas to ask which accounts aren't eligible, and it seems there's no hard and fast rule.\n\nA spokesperson for British Gas said \"you can build up the number of days (up to ten) based on what products and how long you\u2019ve been with us\", encouraging customers to check the details of their account on the rewards page of their website.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nDespite that, some lucky British gas customers with a duel fuel account are even recording spotting a free 40 days of electricity appear on theirs, so if you are a current British Gas customer, it may be worth having a check to see if you could save some a few extra quid next month.\n\nHowever, you do have a long time to claim the offer, as it's available up until the 31st December 2019.", "description": "British Gas is giving its customers ten free days of electricity next month - just make sure you add the offer to your bill", "authors": ["Molly Holt", "Image", "Reuters", "Hotukdeals", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20650116.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/111_Double-power-socket-and-single-plug-switched-on.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
