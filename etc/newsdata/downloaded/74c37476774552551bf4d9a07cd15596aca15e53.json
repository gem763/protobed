CEO Mark Zuckerberg joined News Corp CEO Robert Thomson for an interview soon after, and Thomson hammered home the need for objective journalism in the age of social media, waxing nostalgic about the importance of rigorous fact-checking in his early career.\n\nAn hour later, however, Zuckerberg struggled to explain how Facebook\u2019s most controversial new partner fits into its mission.\n\nFacebook News is partnering with a variety of regional newspapers and some major national partners, including USA Today and The Wall Street Journal. But as The New York Times and Nieman Lab report, its \u201ctrusted\u201d sources also include Breitbart, a far-right site whose co-founder Steve Bannon once described it as a platform for the white nationalist \u201calt-right.\u201d Breitbart has been criticized for repeated inaccurate and incendiary reporting, often at the expense of immigrants and people of color. Last year, Wikipedia declared it an unreliable source for citations, alongside the British tabloid Daily Mail and the left-wing site Occupy Democrats.\n\nThat\u2019s led to questions about why Breitbart belongs on Facebook News, a feature that will supposedly be held to far tougher standards than the normal News Feed. In a question-and-answer session after the interview, Zuckerberg told Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivan that Facebook would have \u201cobjective standards\u201d for quality.\n\n\u201cMost of the rest of what we operate is helping give people a voice broadly and making sure that everyone can share their opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not this. This is a space that is dedicated to high-quality and curated news.\u201d\n\nFacebook News is held to tougher standards than the normal News Feed\n\nBut when New York Times reporter Marc Tracy asked how including Breitbart served that cause, Zuckerberg emphasized its politics, not its reporting. \u201cPart of having this be a trusted source is that it needs to have a diversity of views in there, so I think you want to have content that represents different perspectives,\u201d he said. Zuckerberg reiterated that these perspectives should comply with Facebook\u2019s standards, and he was cagey about Breitbart\u2019s presence, saying that \u201chaving someone be possible or eligible to show up\u201d doesn\u2019t guarantee frequent placement. \u201cBut I certainly think you want to include a breadth of content in there,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook hasn\u2019t released a full list of News partners, so we don\u2019t know the project\u2019s full scope. Breitbart is hardly the only right-leaning name Facebook\u2019s list, which includes National Review, The Washington Times, and News Corp\u2019s own Fox News. But it has faced unique challenges to its editorial integrity \u2014 including, in recent years, some of Breitbart\u2019s own former staff denouncing its policies.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s answer is unlikely to satisfy critics, who see the site\u2019s inclusion as an example of Facebook surrendering principle to appease right-wing commentators. Left-leaning nonprofit Media Matters for America called the decision \u201creflexive pandering to conservative pundits, right-wing extremists, and white nationalists.\u201d Activist group Sleeping Giants \u2014 which has spearheaded a major advertiser boycott of Breitbart \u2014 retweeted several reporters criticizing the news, including BuzzFeed News writer Joe Bernstein, whose reporting on Breitbart and white nationalism caused one of its biggest backers to sell his stake.\n\nBut Facebook wants to win over Republicans, including lawmakers who have grilled Zuckerberg in Congress over shaky claims of \u201canti-conservative bias,\u201d as well as President Donald Trump, who has threatened tech companies with new laws and antitrust action. Leaving out Breitbart might earn Facebook condemnation from these quarters.\n\nIn a New York Times editorial, Zuckerberg noted that outright misinformation is banned on Facebook News. \u201cIf a publisher posts misinformation, it will no longer appear in the product,\u201d he wrote. So in theory, Breitbart will only stay on Facebook News if it hews to the rules. But that doesn\u2019t explain why Facebook chose an outlet known for sensationalism and misinformation in the first place \u2014 and as Facebook News matures, kicking off a site like Breitbart might cause more controversy than never including it at all.", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced questions about why the newly launched Facebook News \u2014 a highly curated journalism tab \u2014 includes the far-right", "authors": ["Adi Robertson", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-m2u8ohZcFWe6SB5ut0rXxjrVT4=/0x21:1148x622/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19320010/Screen_Shot_2019_10_25_at_1.09.59_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
