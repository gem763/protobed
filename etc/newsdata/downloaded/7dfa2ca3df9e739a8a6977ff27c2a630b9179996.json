Sometimes it's a priceless treasure, like some rare works of art . Other times it's everyday objects -- even ones as overlooked as barbie dolls or coffee cups\n\nBorn into a superabundance of riches, the modern-day Rothschilds' story is inevitably different. Lord Jacob Rothschild, heir to the family's English branch, says his collecting habit is driven by the desire to acquire the rare things that are \"missing.\"\n\nWaddesdon Manor, the English Rothschilds' ancestral palace in rural Buckinghamshire, is a fortified castle overflowing with the type of Versailles-inspired, gilded extravagance that became known in the late 19th century as \"le go\u00fbt Rothschild\" (or \"the Rothschild taste\").\n\nInside, the full, eclectic range of objects amassed by Jacob Rothschild's ancestors -- once unrivaled as the world's richest family, and today possessors of an unknown fortune -- become clear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 12 Lord Jacob Rothschild at his family's ancestral estate Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire, England, August 2019.

There are, of course, some gaps in the collection. And it's of great interest to me -- and great fun -- closing those gaps.\"\n\nSet amid a 4,000-acre estate, Waddesdon was built as a weekend retreat to accommodate its original owner's twin passions: weekend partying and collecting valuables. The two were linked, explained Jo Fells, head of communications at Waddesdon. After all, she said, there are few things wealthy Victorians liked more -- after some feasting and drinking -- than brisk strolls, browsing art and writing letters \"to tell everyone how good a time they were having\".\n\nDesigned by French architect Gabriel-Hippolyte Destailleur for Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild in the 1870s, Waddesdon is itself a greatest hits compilation of architectural styles.\n\nWaddeston is a 4,000-acre estate designed in the 1870s.

But thousands of items remain in the family's personal collection.\n\nThe desk that once belonged to Marie Antoinette, the infamously decadent last Queen of France who was guillotined during the French Revolution, is \"one of the great treasures of the house\" and a \"perfect example\" of what his ancestors wanted, says Rothschild.\n\n\"The dream of a Rothschild collection of the 19th century would have been... the queen's desk,\" says Rothschild, produced by \"one of the greatest French cabinet makers of the day.\"\n\nRothschild's collection includes a desk that once belonged to Marie Antoinette.

But Rothschild says he is always looking to develop to the collection's unique character and find complementary works.\n\nRothschild points to an oil painting of a boy delicately arranging a house of cards. This is one of his own acquisitions, a painting by Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin, an 18th-century French painter famous for his masterful still-lifes and softly-lit portraits of everyday scenes. Rothschild's ancestor, Henri, once owned 18 of Chardin's works, though they were all destroyed in a bombing during World War II.\n\nThe painting of the boy was offered to Rothschild by an art dealer, and apparently similar \"random opportunistic examples\" often present themselves to the family.\n\n\"If you look around this room, you'll see an extremely interesting silver cup by the Dutch 17th-century artist called Van Vianen,\" Rothschild says during a tour of the house. \"Suddenly a dealer rang me out of the blue... and said, 'I found a picture of the silver artist's son holding the cup. He was acting as his father's salesman. You ought to buy it'.\n\n\"So we did buy it,\" he said of the cup, which now stands next to the painting of the same cup in Waddesdon's treasure room.\n\nA painting of a boy holding a silver cup hangs above the cup itself.

When temporary export bans are placed on artworks deemed to be national treasures, in the hope that a UK-based buyer can be found, Rothschild has been known to step in.\n\nThere are plenty of more carefully curated acquisitions too -- especially in the manor's expansive collection of contemporary art. Jacob Rothschild has added paintings (portraits of himself, specifically) by his friends Lucian Freud and David Hockney. He has also commissioned a chandelier of smashed porcelain by German designer Ingo Maurer and two giant \"candlestick\" sculptures by Portuguese artist Joana Vasconcelos, constructed from bottles of Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild wine.\n\nThere is plenty of wine around. Waddesdon's cellars, containing another sizeable collection: 15,000 bottles of historic wines from the family's estates, Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild and Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild. Dating back to 1868, it's the largest collection of Rothschild wines anywhere in the world.\n\nIt is perhaps unsurprising that there are so many Rothschild collections around. Not only is this a family with over two centuries of dizzying wealth, its one whose story begins with a collector: patriarch Mayer Amschel Rothschild, who launched the family's expansion into finance was, among other things, a dealer in coins, medals and jewels.\n\nFrom humble beginnings (\"in the Ghetto, in Frankfurt, and they lived in a room, 18 of them,\" as Rothschild characterizes it), the family has done more than almost any other to amass collections of valuable artworks, public and private, around the world.\n\nAmid the 25,000 works of art at Waddesdon, Jacob Rothschild appears something like a collector of collections, completing what is left to him and amassing countless new additions.\n\nHe's unable to even guess the items' combined value. Is there, though, one favored piece among the lot?\n\n\"Obviously I have particular works of art that I love in this place,\" he replies. \"But I don't think there is a particular object... (that) I go back to again and again and again.\n\n\"I think I enjoy the luxury of being able to see the range of works of art we have here, and enjoying them all and learning from them in very different ways.\"", "description": "Lord Jacob Rothschild, who owns Marie Antoinette's writing desk, says his collecting habit is driven by the desire to acquire what's \"missing.\"", "authors": ["Video", "Ed Scott-Clarke"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190926141820-rothschild-lord-jacob-home-21-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
