Age was the biggest risk factor for frailty \u2013 but being overweight and smoking also increases the odds of becoming frail\n\nFigures show around 10 per cent of over-65s are frail, which often robs pensioners of their ability to wash and dress themselves.\n\nFew studies have been carried out on the condition, which has made it hard for scientists to pinpoint ways to delay the onslaught of frailty.\n\nThe De Montfort-led study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, now suggests \u2018there may be scope to reduce frailty incidence and progression\u2019.\n\nDr Nils Niederstrasser and colleagues, who included experts from the island of Grenada, analysed data from 8,780 volunteers between 2004 and 2017.\n\nWHAT ARE THE FIVE WARNING SIGNS OF FRAILTY IN OLD AGE? According to a June 2018 study by University College London, middle-aged people are at risk of frailness in later life if they: Are obese: Some 7.9 per cent of obese people become frail compared to 2.7 per cent of those of a healthy weight\n\nSome 7.9 per cent of obese people become frail compared to 2.7 per cent of those of a healthy weight Are inactive: Sedentary people have a 6.2 per cent chance of suffering from sudden weight loss or exhaustion in later life versus 2.5-to-3.5 per cent of those who are active\n\nSedentary people have a 6.2 per cent chance of suffering from sudden weight loss or exhaustion in later life versus 2.5-to-3.5 per cent of those who are active Smoke: Some 5.4 per cent of smokers become frail compared to 3.5 per cent without the habit\n\nSome 5.4 per cent of smokers become frail compared to 3.5 per cent without the habit Have high interleukin 6 levels: This is a marker of inflammation in the body. Those with the highest levels have a four per cent risk of frailness versus one per cent with the lowest\n\nThis is a marker of inflammation in the body. Those with the highest levels have a four per cent risk of frailness versus one per cent with the lowest Have high C-reactive protein levels : Also a mark of inflammation, middle-aged people with the highest levels have a four per cent chance of being physically weak versus a two per cent risk in those with the lowest amounts. These proteins can be reduced by de-stressing and cutting back on sugar.\n\nResults showed participants who led sedentary lives were more than twice as likely to become frail over the duration of the study.\n\nVolunteers who earned the least money and those with the greatest sensitivity to pain faced an 80 and 39 per cent greater risk, respectively.\n\nBeing obese (33 per cent), being a current or previous smoker (29 per cent), or having a high waist to hip ratio (25 per cent) all also raised the odds.\n\nOther factors that appeared to increase the risk of becoming frail included a lack of education, having a weak lower body and loneliness.\n\nDr Niederstrasser\u2019s team said obesity \u2013 which can be prevented through exercise and eating better \u2013 may cause wear and tears to joints.\n\nThey added that physical activity can also improve bone mass and muscle function, which may prevent falls \u2013 a major cause of frailty.\n\nAnd smoking is known to cause a range of debilitating ailments, including heart disease, which have a \u2018knock-on negative effect\u2019 on health.\n\nThe increased risk of frailty for those in the most pain could be explained by them being less likely to move and leading more sedentary lives.\n\nDr Niederstrasser said: \u2018By becoming more active, quitting smoking, and losing weight, a person may dramatically reduce their chance of becoming frail.\n\n\u2018For example, a person who does not smoke and is physically active has half the risk of becoming frail compared to a person who is physically inactive and smokes.\u2019", "description": "Scientists led by a team at Leicester's De Montfort University tracked almost 9,000 participants over the age of 50 for 12 years, on average.
