'Of course I've been upset. There have been times I've cried, definitely. This isn't the life I'd dreamed I'd have, being a single mum. But we're happy and healthy.'\n\nAmy also revealed she won't be taking Polly to visit her father in prison, because he has only seen her 'about four times' throughout her young life.\n\n'If he was an amazing dad, then yes,' she said. 'But as he's only been in her life for six months I definitely wouldn't.'", "description": "Amy Childs continued to showcase the fruits of her fitness labour as she posed up in a tiny crop-top on Friday.", "authors": ["Eve Buckland For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/14/19588822-0-image-a-210_1570798937874.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
