REUTERS/Andrej Ivanov\n\nThe televised event on Wednesday night took place in the powerful and predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec, where Trudeau\u2019s Liberals are looking to pick up seats on Oct. 21 to offset expected losses elsewhere.\n\nPundits generally agreed the clear winner was Yves-Francois Blanchet, leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois. Since taking charge earlier this year, the 54-year-old has worked to heal internal divisions, and his party is rising in the polls.\n\nThis could hurt the Liberals, who hold 40 of the province\u2019s 78 seats. They are targeting another 10 amid the collapse of the minority New Democrats, a left-leaning opposition party that competes for the same segment of the electorate as Trudeau.\n\nUniversity of Montreal politics professor Pierre Martin predicted Blanchet\u2019s continued rise would make life more uncertain for the Liberals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy one to call but I think they do have reasons to be concerned because of the expectation they might gain a good number of seats,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nPolls show Trudeau - trying to shake off the damage done by images showing him in blackface - could retain power but with only a minority of seats, leaving him dependent on opposition legislators to govern.\n\nWorking with the avowedly separatist Bloc poses a risk for federal parties committed to keeping Canada together.\n\n\u201cThe Bloc ... are the party to watch as a spoiler for the Liberals,\u201d said Nanos Research Chairman Nik Nanos.\n\n\u201cA potentially reinvigorated Bloc in a minority parliament makes the governing coalition calculus more complicated.\u201d\n\nBlanchet said the Bloc would be happy to work with either a Liberal or Conservative minority government, studying every piece of draft legislation on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\u201cIn most cases we could negotiate gains for Quebec in the context of a minority government,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nMaking life more complicated is the fact that the vote in some Quebec seats is split among the Liberals, the Bloc, the New Democrats and the official opposition Conservatives.\n\n\u201cLast night probably gave the Bloc a bit of a push,\u201d Leger pollster Christian Bourque said in an interview, predicting the party could jump from the 10 seats it has now to 18 or 20.\n\nThat could potentially put the Bloc in third place ahead of the New Democrats and holding the balance of power.\n\nAsked about his declining popularity, Trudeau told reporters in Montreal on Thursday that any government \u201cis going to go through experiences where people have disagreements with them.\u201d\n\nIn the streets of Quebec City, the heart of a region where the Conservatives did well in 2015, several people stopped by Reuters said they had been impressed by Blanchet.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, TVA network host Pierre Bruneau, Liberal leader and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh pose before a French language debate for the 2019 federal election at TVA studios in Montreal, Quebec, Canada October 2, 2019.
