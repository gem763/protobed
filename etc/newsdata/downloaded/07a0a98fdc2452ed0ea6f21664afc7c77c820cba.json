It shows the character of the team.\n\n\u201cWe get the games where we want them. We\u2019ve been leading 1-0 in many games and not kicked on. Today we were excellent, with fast flowing football. That\u2019s Manchester United. We\u2019re trying to get back to that.\n\n\u201cMarcus has that strike in him. I\u2019ve seen him in training so many times.\n\nBrandon Williams impressed once again after starting at Chelsea (John Walton/PA)\n\n\u201cWhen you give young lads the experience, like Brandon Williams got tonight \u2013 and the kid was outstanding \u2013 it\u2019s only going to help them.\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019re not the finished product, we\u2019re a work in progress and keep trying to improve.\u201d\n\nDefeat meant Chelsea failed to get a measure of revenge on United for their 4-0 defeat on the opening day of the season.\n\nMarcus Rashford celebrates scoring the match-winner at Stamford Bridge (John Walton/PA)\n\nThe teams have gone in opposite directions since then, with United struggling for form while Chelsea are fourth in the Premier League and joint top of their Champions League group.\n\nHowever, United took a 25th-minute lead after Daniel James won the spot-kick, the winger getting across Marcos Alonso in the area before tumbling to the deck.\n\nRashford may have missed a penalty against Norwich at the weekend, but he showed no sign of nerves as he calmly sent Willy Caballero the wrong way.\n\nThey got their equaliser on the hour mark, Batshuayi nodding on Caballero\u2019s clearance before turning away from Harry Maguire.\n\nMichy Batshuayi (third right) had equalised for Chelsea (John Walton/PA)\n\nThe Belgian frontman outstripped Maguire and Victor Lindelof before firing past Rojo and into the corner of Sergio Romero\u2019s net.\n\nBut Rashford settled the match in the 73rd minute in spectacular fashion, lifting his shot over the wall and underneath Caballero\u2019s crossbar before sliding on his knees in celebration in front of a delirious away end.\n\nChelsea boss Frank Lampard admitted: \u201cThe second goal doesn\u2019t come into the equation. It was special, a bolt out of the blue.\n\nDisappointing end to this game and the cup, but still plenty to go... #ChinUp #KPTBFFH \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/yaGlEocF2b \u2014 Michy Batshuayi (@mbatshuayi) October 30, 2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great technique. It was a stunning strike from him, at a time when I felt we were really in the ascendancy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had seven wins on the trot, with some taxing games in the Champions League. Our form in the league has been really good, and it\u2019s clear they are our priorities.\n\n\u201cI saw a lot of positive things. I hate losing but it\u2019s clear there is a bigger picture.\u201d", "description": "The England international\u00b4s stunning free-kick secured United\u00b4s third successive away victory in all competitions.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/23/wire-20401470-1572477274-299_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
