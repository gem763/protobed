Over the past few years, however, the bowl cut has gone from shorthand for male uncoolness to a chilling symbol of racism and extremist violence, according to a recent report from the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nOn Thursday morning, the ADL released its additions to its hate symbols database, a library of more than 200 symbols used by hate groups. In addition to entries such as the Happy Merchant, a meme of an anti-Semitic caricature gleefully rubbing his hands together; and the \u201cOK\u201d hand emoji, which actually originated as a 4chan and an 8chan hoax before being adopted by the white supremacist movement as an actual hate symbol, the database now contains the bowl cut, a reference to the hairstyle sported by Dylann Roof, the white supremacist behind the 2015 mass shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, which killed nine people. (Roof pleaded guilty to state murder charges in 2017 and is currently serving nine consecutive life sentences without parole.)\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nOn white supremacist chat forums on platforms like Gab and Discord, the bowl cut takes a few different forms. Images of Roof\u2019s hair are often photoshopped on other people in various white supremacist memes (one popular meme features Roof\u2019s bowl cut superimposed on an SS military shield); some white supremacists will also Photoshop a halo or a glowing effect around Roof\u2019s head for emphasis. The bowl cut is also used as verbal shorthand within fringe groups, with white supremacists referring to themselves as \u201cthe bowl gang\u201d or inserting \u201cbowl\u201d into other words, such as swapping out \u201cbrother\u201d for \u201cbowlther.\u201d There is even a white supremacist called the BowlCast, named after Roof\u2019s distinctive cut.\n\nThe rise of the bowl cut has nothing to do with the hairstyle itself, or the view that it\u2019s somehow a cool or attractive hairstyle to be emulated. In fact, in a lot of ways, it\u2019s precisely the fact that it looks silly that it gained traction as a white supremacist symbol. Mark Pitcavage, the senior research fellow with ADL\u2019s Center on Extremism, compares Roof\u2019s bowl cut to Hitler\u2019s mustache: an objectively ridiculous-looking, yet distinctive enough feature that it can be easily subject to memeification. Yet its rise is inextricably tied to part of a larger effort to canonize Roof within the white supremacist movement.\n\nThe ADL started seeing white supremacists incorporate the bowl cut into their iconography around 2017, a few years after the Charleston church shooting. Pitcavage says this timing is significant, in large part because in the immediate aftermath of the Charleston shooting, many white supremacists either disavowed Roof or expressed disapproval of his actions \u2014 not necessarily for moral reasons, but because they believed violence would attract undue scrutiny to the movement.\n\nThat changed, however, with the rise of accelerationism, a term used to describe a class of white supremacists who advocate for violence as a means of hastening the collapse of society in order to build a new one. The advent of the alt right around 2016 also \u201cbrought a number of newly radicalized males into the white supremacist movement, who are full of testosterone and adrenaline,\u201d says Pitcavage, which has resulted in a rising acceptance of violence as a means of bringing about societal change. And this has been accompanied by attempts to deify men like Roof, the Tree of Life synagogue shooter, and the New Zealand mosque shooter \u2014 so-called \u201clone wolves\u201d \u2014 as martyrs to the cause. The rise of bowl cut iconography, says Pitcavage, is part of a larger effort to \u201cturn Dylann Roof into an iconic figure that [a certain class of] white supremacists revere and want to emulate,\u201d he says.\n\nOf course, none of this is to say that the bowl cut has risen to the level of, say, Pepe the Frog, in terms of a relatively innocuous symbol becoming synonymous with far-right extremist violence. Like most memes, the bowl cut is entirely dependent on context, and white supremacists \u201care not going around telling people to go out and get bowl cuts,\u201d says Pitcavage.", "description": "The oft-mocked haircut has now become shorthand for a particularly violent strain of far-right extremism", "authors": ["Ej Dickson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/an22VcUGC8ss0E99qrmocA--~B/aD04MDA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/rollingstone.com/4669021a054646e13f543f9ff9a4f58e", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
