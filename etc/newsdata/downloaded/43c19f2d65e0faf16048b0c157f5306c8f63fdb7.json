This underscores the competition we face, not only in the US but around the globe.\"\n\n\"We will of course work constructively with state attorneys general,\" Castleberry said. \"And we welcome a conversation with policymakers about the competitive environment in which we operate.\u201d", "description": "Forty-seven attorneys general have\u00a0joined\u00a0onto the recently announced antitrust investigation into Facebook, the New York attorney general's office announced Tuesday, super-charging a probe that comes amid broader scrutiny of Big Tech by", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/jamesletitia_061119getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
