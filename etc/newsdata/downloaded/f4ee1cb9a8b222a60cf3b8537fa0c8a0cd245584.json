Last night's EIA data was a bit of surprise,\" said McCarthy.\n\nU.S. crude inventories increased by 9.3 million barrels in the week ended Oct.11, compared with analysts' expectations for an increase of 2.9 million barrels.\n\nElsewhere, the joint technical committee monitoring a global deal to cut output between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and partners, including Russia, found compliance with cuts for September stood at 236%, according to four OPEC sources.\n\n\"Concerns about softer growth in the demand for oil and doubts about OPEC's ability to rebalance the market on the current production cut rate will be key drags on prices in the near term,\" ANZ Research said in a note.\n\nOPEC and its allies have agreed to limit their oil production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2020.\n\nOPEC lowered its 2019 global oil demand growth forecast to 0.98 million bpd, while leaving its 2020 demand growth estimate unchanged at 1.08 million bpd, according to OPEC's latest monthly report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Jane Chung; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell and Christian Schmollinger)", "description": "Oil prices fell on Friday after China, the world's largest oil importer, recorded its weakest quarter of economic growth in nearly three decades, dragged down by a trade dispute with the United States.
