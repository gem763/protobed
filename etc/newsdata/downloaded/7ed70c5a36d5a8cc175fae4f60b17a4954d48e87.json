An extended director\u2019s cut version of the special containing additional footage will be available on FNC\u2019s streaming service FOX Nation, beginning on Sunday, September 8th at 8:05 p.m. EDT.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The following column is an excerpt from Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch\u2019s new book, \u201cA Republic, If You Can Keep It.\u201d In this passage, he explains how he evaded the press to get to Washington, D.C., for President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court announcement.\n\nThat life [of anonymity] was now over. Our trip to Washington was enough to convince me of that.\n\nTwo young White House lawyers, Mike and James, had arrived at our home on the Sunday afternoon before the scheduled Thursday evening announcement of my nomination with the task of accompanying Louise and me to the nation\u2019s capital. I was out mowing the lawn and asked the pair to join us for our usual Sunday dinner of chicken curry. They accepted and, after our meal together, headed off to a local hotel with plans to return the next morning to collect us for the flight.\n\nExcept at some point Monday morning the President told the media that he would be making his nomination on Tuesday instead of Thursday. Eager to break the news of the President\u2019s pick before he could make his own announcement, reporters quickly descended on all of the homes of the prospective nominees, and satellite dishes, cameras, microphones, and lawn chairs soon crowded the end of our street.\n\nRUTH BADER GINSBURG: I'M 'ALIVE AND ON MY WAY TO BEING VERY WELL'\n\nMike and James, wearing suits and ties (not exactly standard attire in the Colorado countryside), approached the frenzy in their rental car and immediately realized that if they continued to our home they would be spotted.\n\nTo avoid that, and after more than a few abandoned plans\u2014including a run to the local superstore for casual clothes\u2014the lawyers called to ask: Would Louise and I please hike a mile through the prairie, away from the reporters\u2019 camp? They promised to pick us up at a trailhead. It may have sounded good to them, but the prospect of lugging my wife\u2019s suitcase through brush seemed like a bad idea to me.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nInstead, Louise and I decided to ask a neighbor to drive us out. The reporters had already seen his car come and go a few times and maybe they wouldn\u2019t notice\u2014and, even if they did, it seemed to beat the alternative. Our neighbor, a dear friend, enthusiastically agreed.\n\nAs we got into his car he said, \u201cYou know, Neil, I have a better idea. There\u2019s another way out.\u201d That was news to me. We had lived in our home for years, and while there were plenty of hiking trails and horse paths, there were no other roads out of the neighborhood.\n\nMy friend pointed to a path that led from the back of a neighbor\u2019s house to a nearby commercial barn and said he had managed to drive it before. \u201cI grew up in Iran during the revolution, and I learned a thing or two there,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I would never buy a house with only one escape route.\u201d\n\nSo I fled my house\u2014and, temporarily, the spotlight\u2014by way of a bumpy farm track.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMy neighbor and I came to call our experience the Escape from Lookout Ridge.\n\nIn retrospect, it wasn\u2019t an \u201cescape\u201d at all. That drive threw me face first into the topsy-turvy world of modern-day Supreme Court confirmation battles.\n\nExcerpted from \"A REPUBLIC, IF YOU CAN KEEP IT\" by Neil Gorsuch Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Neil Gorsuch.
