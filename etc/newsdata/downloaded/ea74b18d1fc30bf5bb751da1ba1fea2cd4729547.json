Santa Cruz and realized in studying the books in the stacks that people who identified with gender identity disorder had mental disorders.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I thought we\u2019re not approaching this from the right direction,\u201d Heyer said on the steps of the Supreme Court. \u201cWe need to be addressing the co-morbid problems that are causing people to believe they\u2019re a different gender.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems to be compassionate to me to reach out to those people and actually guide them in the right direction and not fill their bodies with hormones and cut body parts off and rearrange everything in their lives so their lives are totally destroyed,\u201d Heyer said.\n\nHeyer, who has lived as a married man for the past 21 years, has a website, sexchangeregret.com that he said hundreds of thousands of people have visited.\n\n\u201cToday we have a worldwide ministry that reaches over 300 million people a year and people now are de-transitioning in the hundreds,\u201d Heyer said.\n\nHeyer also wrote about his life in USA Today earlier this year:\n\nI was 50 when I had the breast implants removed, but the next few years were spent in confusion and counseling. In 1996, at the age of 55, I was finally free from the desire to live as a woman and changed my legal documents back to Walt, my biologically correct male sex. I still have scars on my chest, reminders of the gender detour that cost me 13 years of my life. I am on a hormone regimen to try to regulate a system that is permanently altered. Had I not been misled by media stories of sex change \u201csuccess\u201d and by medical practitioners who said transitioning was the answer to my problems, I wouldn\u2019t have suffered as I have. Genetics can\u2019t be changed. Feelings, however, can and do change. Underlying issues often drive the desire to escape one\u2019s life into another, and they need to be addressed before taking the radical step of transition. After de-transitioning, I know the truth: Hormones and surgery may alter appearances, but nothing changes the immutable fact of your sex.\n\nHeyer told people gathered at the Supreme Court \u2014 many there to protest for homosexual and transgender rights \u2014 that he has compassion for people who are struggling with their gender dysphoria but that true compassion calls for telling them the truth.\n\n\u201cI have tremendous compassion for those people who are struggling deeply with their identity and we all need to love them and have compassion for them,\u201d Heyer said. \u201cBut compassion isn\u2019t filling them with hormones; cutting off body parts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s addressing the issues that are causing them to feel that way,\u201d Heyer said.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "A former transgender woman spoke at the Supreme Court on Tuesday about her regrets and how to help others struggling with their idenity.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Walt-Heyer-former-Transgender-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
