Even if it is, few have confidence he can get it through a fractious UK parliament.\n\nThat would leave the British prime minister attempting a last-minute negotiation among leaders at the October European Council summit, something they have said they will not do. If a deal fails, then Johnson is compelled by legislation to seek an extension to the Article 50 negotiating period, something Johnson has vowed he will never do.\n\nPOLITICO\u2019s expert Brexit team on both sides of the Channel will pick their way through the noise ahead of the Council summit in this live Brexit briefing call \u2014 exclusively for Pro subscribers.\n\nNot a Brexit Pro subcriber but are interested in attending?
