But one bad year isn't always a slippery slope that leads to progressively worse seasons.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSome players bounce back.\n\nBy identifying bounce-back candidates, you may be able to get some steals in fantasy drafts in which other gamers are too hesitant to pull the trigger.\n\n[Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Basketball league for free today]\n\nHere are some players who underwhelmed a year ago but are poised for a bounce-back:\n\nBest career 8-cat rank: 13\n\nLast season\u2019s 8-cat rank: 49\n\nGreen was a top-20 fantasy player back in 2015-16, which was, of course, the season before Kevin Durant arrived. Since then, his fantasy rank has declined each season, bottoming out at 49 last year. That\u2019s mostly been due to a decline in usage, as Green hit four-year lows in points (7.4), rebounds (7.3) and assists (6.9) per game. With Durant moving on, Green has an opportunity to take back a significant portion of the offense. The addition of D\u2019Angelo Russell complicates things, but with Klay Thompson out until the 2020 portion of the season \u2014 possibly February or March \u2014 the Warriors will need to involve Green if they have any hope of remaining competitive in the Western Conference.\n\nWithout Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson, Draymond Green could have a resurgent season.

He was ranked 10th during his final year with the Clippers (age-31), and he ranked 13th and 19th, respectively, in two years with the Rockets. Now the point guard of the Thunder, Paul moves away from a high-usage backcourt partner in James Harden. That could allow the veteran to thrive, especially in the assists department. Health remains a massive concern, but there\u2019s potential for a big payoff if Paul takes control of OKC\u2019s offense, as expected.\n\nKristaps Porzingis, Dallas Mavericks\n\nBest career 8-cat rank: 22\n\nLast season\u2019s 8-cat rank: N/A\n\nRecovering from a torn ACL, Porzingis didn\u2019t play last season, but he was the 22nd-ranked player in 2017-18. Paired up with Luka Doncic, Porzingis is part of one of the best young duos in the league. Doncic will be the best playmaker Porzingis has ever played with, and the latter should often be put in a position for easy looks. Porzingis was a force as a scorer (22.7 PPG) and shot-blocker (2.4 BLK) the last time we saw him, though that was 19 months ago. Playing on a better team will hopefully lead to higher efficiency (43.9 FG%) and potentially some assists (1.2 APG) \u2014 both areas in which he underwhelmed in New York. There may be some rest days for the injury-prone big man, but he heads into the 2019-20 season with plenty of upside.\n\nOtto Porter, Chicago Bulls\n\nBest career 8-cat rank: 40\n\nLast season\u2019s 8-cat rank: 60\n\nA rare injury-filled season caused Porter to play just 56 games in 2018-19. Normally, he\u2019s one of the healthier players in the NBA, having played between 74 and 80 games across the prior four campaigns. Perhaps as a result of the injuries and/or team chemistry issues in Washington, Porter\u2019s field-goal percentage (40.6%) and rebounding (5.6 RPG) took significant dips compared to 2017-18, which dropped his per-game fantasy ranking by about two rounds relative to his career production.\n\nOnce he was dealt to Chicago, Porter played arguably the best basketball of his career, averaging 17.5 points, 5.5 rebounds, 2.7 assists and a combined 1.8 STL/BLK across 32.8 minutes. He\u2019ll need to continue having a significant role on the wing for the Bulls in 2019-20, as the team\u2019s depth at small forward is incredibly thin. As a result, we should expect Porter\u2019s production to jump back up to its usual levels.\n\nJeff Teague, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nBest career 8-cat rank: 19\n\nLast season\u2019s 8-cat rank: 95\n\nWhile we shouldn\u2019t expect Teague to crack the top-20 again, his 2018-19 campaign isn\u2019t indicative of his potential for this season. He appeared in just 42 games due to injury after playing at least 70 games in every season since 2012-13 \u2014 and even when he was on the court, Teague wasn\u2019t 100 percent healthy. He struggled with his shooting, dipping below 44.0 FG% for the first time since 2013-14, but Teague\u2019s passing numbers were excellent, as he averaged a career-high 8.2 assists per game.\n\nAs the Timberwolves\u2019 main source of playmaking, that should carry over to 2019-20. During his first season in Minnesota, he ranked as the 50th-best fantasy player, which seems to be a mark he could realistically reach again.\n\nGordon Hayward, Boston Celtics\n\nBest career 8-cat rank: 23\n\n[ Fantasy Basketball Draft Rankings: PG | SG | SF | PF | C ]\n\nLast season\u2019s 8-cat rank: 133\n\nHayward is now two full years removed from his devastating leg injury, and it\u2019s reasonable to expect a bounce back. From 2013-14 to 2016-17, Hayward was a top-45 player, and he made his first All-Star team in the loaded West the year before leaving for Boston. Given the offensive options around him (Kemba Walker, Jayson Tatum, Enes Kanter), we shouldn\u2019t expect Hayward to get back to 20-plus points per game. But it\u2019s within grasp for him to trend near his career highs in rebounds (5.4) and assists (5.2) per game, assuming he can play minutes in the low-to-mid 30s. Hayward is unquestionably a risky pick, but he\u2019s obviously a talented, well-rounded player when at full strength.\n\nDerrick Favors, New Orleans Pelicans\n\nBest career 8-cat rank: 36\n\nLast season\u2019s 8-cat rank: 96\n\nFavors has always been a very productive fantasy player when given the minutes. From the 2013-14 season through the 2015-16 season, he had an average fantasy rank of 47.6 while seeing 31.0 minutes per game. However, he\u2019s failed to crack the top-90 since, and he saw just 23.2 minutes per game for the Jazz in 2018-19.\n\nNow, Favors takes his talents to New Orleans. There, he projects as the Pelicans\u2019 starting center, and his competition for minutes is relatively thin. Zion Williamson will play some small-ball five, but he should play mostly at power forward. Rookie Jaxson Hayes is very much unpolished, and Jahlil Okafor is, at the end of the day, Jahlil Okafor. As a result, Favors should be set to return to the expanded minutes-load he saw during his peak years in Utah.\n\nRicky Rubio, Phoenix Suns\n\nBest career 8-cat rank: 34\n\nLast season\u2019s 8-cat rank: 86\n\nTrapped in Utah\u2019s slow-paced offense and arguably misused, Rubio should have an opportunity to revert to his former self in Phoenix. The presence of Devin Booker means Rubio may still spend more time off-ball than is ideal for a subpar floor-spacer, but the latter was brought in to help facilitate open looks for the rest of the team. As a member of the Timberwolves, Rubio held an average fantasy rank of 45.0. While that would be quite the jump from last season\u2019s mark of 86, it\u2019s within the realm of possibility if he\u2019s properly utilized.\n\nNicolas Batum, Charlotte Hornets\n\nBest career 8-cat rank: 16\n\nLast season\u2019s 8-cat rank: 105\n\nBatum was a top-55 fantasy player for six of seven seasons between 2011-12 and 2016-17, but his production has fallen off over the past two years while Kemba Walker and Jeremy Lamb saw their roles increase. But Walker and Lamb are both gone, and new starting point guard Terry Rozier won\u2019t make up all of that usage on his own. The Hornets have a troubling lack of reliable playmakers, which is why Batum could have a bounce-back season. Historically, he\u2019s provided fantasy value as a three-point shooter and passer who rebounds at a decent rate. While Batum is a veteran and the Hornets are a rebuilding team, he\u2019s not exactly old \u2014 this is his age-31 season \u2014 and the roster is mostly devoid of other quality options on the wing.\n\nDejounte Murray, San Antonio Spurs\n\nBest career 8-cat rank: 178\n\nLast season\u2019s 8-cat rank: N/A\n\nOur sample size for Murray is small. He tore his ACL and missed all of 2018-19, and he only became a true rotation player in his sophomore season. With that said, Murray was the 74th-ranked player during his final 34 games after taking the starting point guard role from Tony Parker. He only needed 26.5 minutes per game to accomplish that, meaning we shouldn't be too concerned that Derrick White emerged as a backcourt weapon last season.\n\nAs a point guard whose primary fantasy value lies in his rebounds and steals, Murray is a unique fantasy asset. He\u2019s also not much of a three-point threat. But if he can expand his range and become even a marginally better shooter, we could see Murray crack the top-70, if not higher.\n\nLonzo Ball, New Orleans Pelicans\n\nBest career 8-cat rank: 59\n\nLast season\u2019s 8-cat rank: 103\n\nPutting aside the fact that Ball has played just 99 games in two seasons, he\u2019s had an unusual start to his NBA career. He was asked to be the point guard of a rebuilding team during his rookie year, then was tasked with finding a suitable role next to LeBron James last season. It\u2019s difficult to imagine most young players succeeding in those scenarios. Ball will get a fresh start in New Orleans during the 2019-20 season, where he is expected to start next to Jrue Holiday. On the back of excellent passing and defensive numbers, Ball managed to be a top-60 player during his rookie year. If he can make any improvements as a shooter, his entire game could open up.\n\nKent Bazemore, Portland Trail Blazers\n\nBest career 8-cat rank: 66\n\nLast season\u2019s 8-cat rank: 146\n\nBazemore\u2019s fantasy value has been up-and-down, but he hit a new four-year low last season. He struggled with his efficiency, posting the third-worst true shooting percentage (50.7) of his seven-year career. He also saw his workload (24.5 MPG) drop to its lowest mark since 2014-15. But the Trail Blazers are desperately thin on the wing, and his presence will be needed. Whether that translates into significantly improved fantasy value is up for debate, but he\u2019ll likely be given every opportunity to establish himself as a reliable two-way option at small forward.\n\nHassan Whiteside, Portland Trail Blazers\n\nBest career 8-cat rank: 15\n\nLast season\u2019s 8-cat rank: 106\n\nWhiteside\u2019s fantasy rank has decreased every year since 2015-16, reaching a new low last season when he was eventually benched for Bam Adebayo. But with Jusuf Nurkic likely to be sidelined until February or March, Portland has opted to take a chance on the mercurial big man. The theoretical makings of a bounce-back year are there: Whiteside is in a contract year and the Blazers need him to be a legitimate, high-minute option every night. If he trends close to 30 minutes per game, the statistical impact could be huge. He provides elite production in rebounds, blocks and field-goal percentage, which helped fuel back-to-back top-30 seasons during his second- and- third years in Miami.\n\nGoran Dragic, Miami Heat\n\nBest career 8-cat rank: 23\n\nLast season\u2019s 8-cat rank: 154\n\nDragic fought through injury to appear in 36 games last season, but he never really looked healthy. There are some factors working against Dragic this upcoming season, the primary two being his age (33) and the Heat\u2019s acquisition of Jimmy Butler. Justise Winslow and Dion Waiters also figure to handle the ball a fair amount. Still, Dragic might be able to make some noise as a bench-leading playmaker. He even posted a top-80 season when seeing just 26.5 minutes per game in 2011-12. There\u2019s probably not much upside to taking Dragic inside the top-100 this season, but it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if he sneaks into the double-digit ranks by the time we get to April.\n\nMore From Yahoo Fantasy Sports", "description": "Let's take a look at some key bounce-back candidates, led by the Warriors' Draymond Green.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GGMphLi6GbC1ydAwbSC3qw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MY00CjbO.j.10M9sL8x.3Q--~B/aD0yNTA0O3c9Mzc1NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/3f4290d0-e16e-11e9-bffb-a11dff59d80d", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
