A total of 477 people have been detained.\n\n\u2013 State of emergency \u2013\n\nPresident Lenin Moreno scrapped fuel subsidies as part of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund to obtain loans despite Ecuador\u2019s high public debt.\n\nOn Sunday, Moreno had called for dialogue with the indigenous groups.\n\nNelson Erazo, the leader of the Popular Front of workers and students, has said \u201cthe people\u2019s actions will not stop here if the government does not change its policy.\u201d\n\nThe subsidies were costing the government $1.3 billion a year.\n\nThe IMF agreement, signed in March, allowed Ecuador to borrow $4.2 billion.\n\nMoreno \u2014 who blames the deterioration in the country\u2019s finances on Correa \u2014 declared a state of emergency on Thursday.\n\nIt allows the government to restrict movement, to use the armed forces to maintain order and to censor the press.\n\n\u201cThis is a very difficult situation, that could lead us into less stable situations, to governments that fall,\u201d said Simon Pachano, a political scientist at Quito\u2019s FLACSO university.\n\nCONAIE warned that security forces entering indigenous areas would be captured and held.\n\nIndigenous leaders claimed they were holding several dozen soldiers since Sunday.", "description": "Machachi (Ecuador) (AFP) \u2013 Protesters clashed with Ecuadoran forces Monday as they marched toward the capital to demonstrate against soaring fuel", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/321c68_indigenous-people-farmers-protesting-rising-fuel-prices-clashed-police-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
