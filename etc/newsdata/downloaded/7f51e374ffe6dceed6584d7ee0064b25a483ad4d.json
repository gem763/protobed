The Pentagon plans to have version 1.0 up and running in a few months. And both versions of the annual National Defense Authorization Act\u2014now in conference committee\u2014have language on the Space Force.\n\nThere are strong arguments that, done right, the space force would be good for America. At this stage, then, it\u2019s worth thinking about what the character of our new force to look like.\n\nAnd where better to look for inspiration than Hollywood? Here are five films that ought to inform how America\u2019s military serves on the high frontier.\n\n5. Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956). This classic black-and-white science fiction thriller is worth watching just to see the aliens mow down the Washington Monument, the Capital and Union Station. As they cruise over the mall, be sure to note the temporary office buildings from World War II still lining the reflecting pool.\n\nRather than be subjugated by superior enemy technology, scientists and soldiers develop an asymmetrical technology that takes down the enemy ships and saves the earth. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll need from our new space force\u2014an innovative cadre of men and women who can out-innovate as much as out-muscle our adversaries in outer space.\n\nHere is hoping the space force is an out-of-the-box thinking creative force.\n\n4. Forbidden Planet (1956). Take Sigmund Freud, William Shakespeare and robots on another planet. Stir. Add in background music composed of \u201celectronic tonalities\u201d that was so innovative and otherworldly it was not considered eligible for an Oscar as a soundtrack. Pour out one of Hollywood\u2019s most iconic outer space movies.\n\nWhat do Commander John J. Adams and his crew have to teach our space force? Disciple and mission-focus are the bywords of this company of space troopers.\n\nGuards and the space cook get extra duty for slacking off. (Though, to be fair, how were they to know the monsters were invisible?)\n\nWhen the ship\u2019s doctor breaks the rules, he winds up dead at the hands of an alien machine. That will teach him.\n\nIn space, you can hear the captain scream. So follow orders! Our space force needs to be as professional as the crew of C-57D.\n\n3. Starship Troopers (1997). Why do people hate this movie? Yes, it barely resembles the Robert Heinlein book it was based on. But hey, you get $127 million-worth of state-of-the-art-special effects, lots of alien-bashing action and entertaining characters.\n\nBoth Heinlein\u2019s book and the film were criticized for flirting with ideas that seemed a bit fascistic. Fair enough, we don\u2019t want Nazis in space. We already had a film about Nazis in space with Iron Sky, and it didn\u2019t end well for Earth.\n\nBut we certainly want our space force to be patriotic. And we want them to defend America and its vital interests just as fiercely and doggedly as John \u201cJohnny\u201d Rico, his girlfriend Carmen Ibanez, and their psychic best friend \u201cDoogie Howser\u201d defended the Federation.\n\nWe need a force of space patriots.\n\n2. Galaxy Quest (1999). In this send-up of Star Trek, a band of TV-actors are whisked into space to battle really bad aliens. This is arguably the funniest space movie ever. (It\u2019s toughest competition in that category: Spaceballs and the Mystery Science Theater version of This Island Earth.)\n\nLet\u2019s face it. Our space force is going to need a sense of humor. A TV show making fun of the force is already in the works. Even serious researchers make jokes about the idea.\n\nClearly, our space guardians will have to be able to take a joke.\n\n1. Hidden Figures (2016). Based on a best-selling non-fiction book, the film tells the story of black, female mathematicians who worked at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and were a big part of why America won the space race. This is a moving and inspiring film, not to be missed.\n\nThis film also reminds what makes America a winner. We have to be smarter than the other guy. And that requires finding smart people and letting them do their stuff. That is what gives America the right stuff (which brings to mind another good space force movie\u2014The Right Stuff).\n\nWe need a force that can outsmart our space enemies.", "description": "It sure looks like, one way or another, America\u2019s Space Force is going to take-off.
