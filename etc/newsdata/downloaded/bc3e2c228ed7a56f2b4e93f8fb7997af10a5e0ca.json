Adams, who was holding tallboy Bud Light cans in each hand, remained determined to get that baseball without putting down his beers.

And I got it.\"\n\nHe added that he didn't even feel the ball hit him.", "description": "Nats fan Jeff Adams, who was holding tallboy beer cans in each hand, was determined to get Yordan Alvarez's home run without putting down his beers.", "authors": ["Andrew Joseph", "Published P.M.
