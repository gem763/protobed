In this version of reality, adjacent to our own, the intelligence community\u2019s whistleblower has been completely discredited.\n\nThat\u2019s plainly false, of course, as the White House and its cohorts know, though the truth has been deemed secondary. It\u2019s why Trump is also throwing around all kinds of related nonsense about Joe Biden, Adam Schiff, and what the president sees as Russia\u2019s purported innocence in its 2016 attack on our elections.\n\nTrump and his team seem to realize a reality-based approach wouldn\u2019t work, and the result is an avalanche of claims that crumble under scrutiny.\n\nBut perhaps no claim is more important than Team Trump\u2019s assertions about Trump\u2019s July phone meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Consider this exchange between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and The Tennessean\u2019s Joel Ebert on Friday:\n\nQ: Two days ago, Wednesday, PBS did an interview with you, and you said the phone call was \u201cwholly appropriate\u201d in your mind. Why do you think it\u2019s appropriate for the President of the United States to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent? POMPEO: Well, that\u2019s not what he did. Q: What did he do, in your mind? POMPEO: He was having a conversation with the new president of Ukraine to talk about our relationship broadly and how we were going to move forward together\u2026. I think the only ones who think Zelensky was pressured are a handful of folks in the media and a bunch of folks on Capitol Hill, the Democratic Party, who are trying to take down this President.\n\nA couple of days earlier, a reporter asked Vice President Mike Pence, \u201cThe president himself has said he wants a foreign country to investigate his rival. Is that okay with you?\u201d Pence replied, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the case.\u201d\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has spent a ridiculous amount of time describing his call with Zelensky as \u201cperfect\u201d and completely uncontroversial.\n\nIn other words, we\u2019re not supposed to have noticed the official White House call summary. Or the \u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though\u201d rhetoric. Or the context. Or the president standing on the White House South Lawn and publicly encouraging foreign countries to go after one of his rivals.\n\nAll of these developments, according to the president and his cohorts, simply did not occur, at least not in the way reality suggests.\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes joked two weeks ago, \u201cThey are all, collectively, going to try to Jedi Mind Trick their way out of this.\u201d That\u2019s even more true now than it was at the time.", "description": "Chris Hayes recently joked, \"They are all, collectively, going to try to Jedi Mind Trick their way out of this.\" That's even more true now.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_bwms_day995_191011_1920x1080.jpg?itok=8hS7Rurc", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
