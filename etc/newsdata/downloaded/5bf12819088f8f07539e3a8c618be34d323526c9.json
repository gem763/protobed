Fingers crossed it doesn\u2019t affect anyone negatively.\"\n\nWhen host Caroline caught wind of Jameela's comments she fired back in defence of her new show.\n\nShe tweeted: \"As you know self image is a complicated, sensitive and personal subject.\n\n(Image: mirror.co.uk)\n\n\"At the heart of this show are people not contestants who have sought help to want to better them selves in their own eyes. Their stories deserve to be told and not ridiculed online.\"\n\nWhen one of Caroline's followers questioned her about the premise of the show, she snapped back: \"You really need to watch it .. it\u2019s a discussion show.\"\n\nThe premise of new Channel 4 lifestyle show The Surjury is participants appealing to a jury about their desired cosmetic sugery.\n\nIf the contributors get 75 per cent of the vote they are given the green light to have the procedure and will be invited back on the show to unveil the results months later.\n\nThe show finished filming in Manchester earlier this year and is expected to air in early 2020.", "description": "The Love Island TV host, who is going to turn 40 in ten days, has already started celebrating her big birthday", "authors": ["Sara-Aisha Kent", "Image", "Sopa Images Lightrocket Via Gett", "Mirror.Co.Uk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20758738.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Caroline-Flack-attends-the-Global-Gift-Gala-at-Kimpton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
