Was this winter really less snowy than usual? Now there\u2019s a handy way to see how your area\u2019s average yearly temperature has varied over time.\n\nIn support of the Global Climate Strike - a week of action to demand climate justice, from September 20 to 27 - Pedestrian Group is doubling down on content that educates and empowers you to do your bit for our planet. Click here to learn more about the global movement fighting for our future.\n\nThe tool is called Show Your Stripes, and it depicts each year\u2019s average temperature as a colour coded stripe. (Most countries\u2019 data covers the years 1901 to 2018.) You can pull up the stripes for a country, or in some places also for regions. In the United States, you can get a stripe graphic for each state.\n\nThey all show a similar story: cooler temperatures at the beginning of the century (represented by white or blue stripes) with occasional reds. Closer to the present, there are a lot more red stripes. The image at the top of this post is for the earth as a whole; some regions are warming more dramatically than others.\n\nThe data comes from the Berkeley Earth temperature dataset, and the tool was created by UK climate scientist Ed Hawkins.\n\nPeople are sharing the graphics online, tagged #ShowYourStripes, to discuss how the climate crisis has affected their area.", "description": "The earth has been warming for decades, but year-to-year changes are hard to watch in real time.
