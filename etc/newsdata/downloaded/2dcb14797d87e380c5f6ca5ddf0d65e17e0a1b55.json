Those are edited videos and images that can look and sound so real that many are easily fooled they're legit. And some say they could be dangerous.\n\nRecent disturbing incidents involving the trend include a fake video of Mark Zuckerberg that has the Facebook founder giving an ominous speech about his company\u2019s power. There is also an app that can undress a photo of any woman with just a click of a button. Now, criticism is directed at a new Chinese app called Zao, which has been slammed for its sketchy privacy policies.\n\nZao went viral almost immediately after launching on Aug. 30. Bloomberg reported that by Sept. 2, it had skyrocketed to the top of app store charts. It was released by the Changsha Shenduronghe Network Technology, a subsidiary of the Chinese company Momo Inc, and allows users to easily swap their faces with anyone in select videos. No prior editing skills required.\n\nZao on the Chinese iTunes App Store.\n\nBy simply taking a series of selfies\u2014moving their mouths and changing facial expressions\u2014people have morphed their faces with actors in shows and movies like Game of Thrones, The Big Bang Theory, Romeo and Juliet, and a slew of Chinese films.\n\nThe app\u2019s deepfake software is, as seen above, alarmingly accurate. While some are amused by it, others are wary.\n\nZao\u2019s rapid rise eventually led to a serious fall. Reviews quickly turned negative when users took a closer look into its privacy policy. It states that users give the app\u2019s owners \u201cfree, irrevocable, permanent, transferable, and relicensable\u201d rights to all user-generated content.\n\nThis means the company can easily access and use anything uploaded onto the app. The backlash has gotten so bad that Zao now has a rating of 1.9 out of five stars on the AppStore. \u201cRubbish, hooligan software,\u201d reads one out of the over 4,000 reviews.\n\nChina\u2019s E-Commerce Research Center has even encouraged government authorities to investigate the app. In a statement, it said that the app \u201cviolates certain laws and standards set by the nation and the industry.\n\nThe Verge also pointed out that because the app is free, its owners are likely \u201cprofiting\u201d from the data users enter.\n\nZao has updated its privacy terms since the criticisms blew up. Now, headshots and videos uploaded by users cannot be used for anything other than to improve the app. If users delete their content, it will be wiped out from the server.\n\n\u201cWe understand the concern about privacy,\u201d said the app\u2019s statement on Chinese microblogging site Weibo. \u201cWe\u2019ve received the feedback, and will fix the issues that we didn\u2019t take into consideration, which will need a bit of time.\u201d\n\nZao is not the only app to be criticised for its privacy policies. In July, FaceApp, created by Russian developers, went viral for allowing users to create \u201cold\u201d versions of themselves by uploading photos. It was a huge hit but people became skeptical about its privacy policy and feared what the app's owners can do with their images.\n\nFind Meera on Twitter and Instagram.\n\n", "description": "Chinese users jumped at the chance to edit themselves into scenes from shows like \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 but those who have studied the app\u2019s privacy policy say it\u2019s not all fun and games.", "authors": ["Talia Slonim", "Meera Navlakha", "David Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d6dd47303dc3700094b6633/lede/1567478924053-deepfake.png?crop=0.9878xw:0.9492xh;0xw,0.0508xh&resize=1200:*"}
