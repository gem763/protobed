Just in the last week or two, my general counsel sent out a note as we typically do in these situations to ensure documents are retained,\" Esper said.\n\nEsper reiterated the point in several other appearances on Sunday morning talk shows, though on \"Fox News Sunday,\" he did not make a commitment to meeting the subpoena's deadline of Tuesday, Oct. 15.\n\n\"I don't know the status of what that document preparation is, what restrictions we may have internally with regard to releasing them, the White House has a say on the release of documents as well,\" he said.\n\nMore: Pentagon, budget office subpoenaed by House Democrats in impeachment inquiry\n\nMore: All of the people who have been subpoenaed so far in House Democrats' impeachment inquiry\n\nChris asks Secretary of Defense Mark Esper if he will comply to the House subpoena during the ongoing impeachment inquiry.
