Mike went there because his family\u2019s there. That\u2019s my understanding of it.\u201d\n\nMr. Pence and his entourage of aides and Secret Service agents spent two nights at the resort in Doonbeg, County Clare, which is located on the west coast of Ireland, on the opposite side of the country from Dublin. Mr. Pence flew across the country to Dublin on Tuesday for official meetings.\n\nThe itinerary prompted criticism from Democrats and others that the vice president had spent taxpayer money to enrich Mr. Trump\u2019s business. Mr. Trump and his allies have regularly stayed at his properties. Mr. Trump retained ownership of the Trump Organization after taking office.\n\nMr. Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Marc Short, told reporters on Air Force Two on Tuesday that the vice president was traveling to Doonbeg because he had family ties there. He said the stay had been approved by the State Department and noted that the trip was originally planned for just one night.\n\nAsked if the president requested that Mr. Pence stay there, Mr. Short said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a request, like a command,\u201d adding \u201cI think that it was a suggestion.\u201d\n\nThe vice president\u2019s office later issued a statement saying: \u201cAt no time did the President direct our office to stay at his Doonbeg resort and any reporting to the contrary is false.\u201d\n\nAsked on Wednesday whether he had suggested Mr. Pence stay at the property, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t suggest anything.\u201d\n\nThe president said Wednesday he hadn\u2019t spoken with Attorney General William Barr about his reported plans to host a holiday party at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of hotels all over the place and people use them because they\u2019re the best,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nWrite to Andrew Restuccia at Andrew.Restuccia@wsj.com and Catherine Lucey at catherine.lucey@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications The photo of Vice President Mike Pence and Karen Pence showed their arrival at Shannon Airport in Ireland on Monday.
