It\u2019s hot. It\u2019s like, it\u2019s hot for who, though?\u201d\n\nKardashian rejected her husband\u2019s criticism. West, after all, has rapped about gang bangs, having sex with his four sisters-in law, sending dick pics and implying he wants to have sex with Taylor Swift, among many other explicit lyrics.\n\nTheo Wargo via Getty Images Kardashian and West attend the 2019 Met Gala Celebrating Camp: Notes on Fashion at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 6 in New York City.\n\n\u201cSo the night before the Met, you\u2019re gonna come in here and say that you\u2019re not into a corset bust?\u201d Kim said, putting her husband\u2019s \u201cnegative energy\u201d on blast. \u201cI\u2019m getting really bad anxiety. What are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are my wife, and it affects me when pictures are too sexy,\u201d West answered.\n\nKardashian pointed out that West helped craft her public image.\n\n\u201cYou built me up to be this sexy person and confidence and all this stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd just because you\u2019re on a journey and you\u2019re on a transformation doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m in the same spot with you.\u201d\n\nWest simply said \u201call right, cool,\u201d and exited the room. Kardashian called his outburst \u201cabsolutely ridiculous.\u201d\n\nDia Dipasupil via Getty Images Kardashian, with West, at the 2019 Met Gala.\n\nWest has indeed taken credit over the years for helping craft Kardashian\u2019s public image, going so far as to email the star when he doesn\u2019t like something about her look. The rapper famously purged Kardashian\u2019s closet of clothing and accessories during a \u201cKUWTK\u201d episode in 2012, but she was fine with it.\n\n\u201cYou want your guy to think you\u2019re really hot. I\u2019ll put something on and [Kanye will] say, \u2018No, that doesn\u2019t look good,\u2019 and I\u2019ll trust him,\u201d Kardashian said in a 2013 interview with Us Weekly.\n\nA few years later, Kardashian admitted on an episode of \u201cLive With Kelly and Michael\u201d that West still dresses her.\n\n\u201cHe totally picks out all my looks,\u201d she said during the 2015 appearance. \u201cI really do trust his opinion.\u201d", "description": "\"It affects my soul when your pictures are too sexy,\" the rapper told his reality star wife on \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\"", "authors": ["Lifestyle Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da48fcd200000330b50086a.jpeg?cache=vuds3juvif&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
