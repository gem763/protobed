It's especially important if you're dealing with summer heat, claustrophobia and a tube that isn't going anywhere. Here's how to survive this rare ordeal as someone unfamiliar with the subway system.\n\nDaily subway trips are an unavoidable fact of life for millions of daily commuters, and even tourists, so for practical tips for surviving subway hell, we turned to experts in dealing with those other claustrophobic germ tubes of mass transit: aeroplanes.\n\nFlight attendants are of course so much more than (to quote the Replacements) waitresses in the sky: They\u2019re a fully trained, quick-thinking first line of defence in the air, who have to deal with all sorts of mini crises while also smiling and making sure you\u2019re comfortable.\n\nBelow, flight attendants give us their best advice for managing a variety of emergency situations you might encounter underground:\n\nSomeone is having a panic attack\n\nClaustrophobia, delays or just existing in New York City can conspire to drive people into a frenzy even on a good day. If you or someone nearby starts having a panic attack and hyperventilating, that old trick of giving someone a paper bag to breathe into actually works, said Mandy Smith, who has 10 years experience as a flight attendant and wrote the book Cabin Fever: The Sizzling Secrets of a Virgin Airlines Flight Attendant.\n\n\u201cIt makes you re-breathe your own carbon dioxide,\u201d she said, which helps balance your oxygen intake. \u201cThey\u2019ll either pass out or it\u2019ll help them. Both ways it helps.\u201d If no paper bag is available, she suggests having the hyperventilating person put a hand on your chest, near the collarbone, and have them follow your breathing.\n\nThe flight attendants said the main thing to do with a passenger in the midst of a freakout is to distract them by asking easy questions in a calm voice. Eye contact is helpful, too. So is positioning yourself as an expert on what\u2019s going on \u2014 i.e. reassuring the person that you deal with these kinds of delays all the time and that everything is going to be fine.\n\n\u201cDistract them from what they\u2019re obsessing about in their head,\u201d Smith said. Simple questions help take their mind off the panic, like asking people where they\u2019re going, where they\u2019re from or if this is their regular subway line.\n\n\u201cI make them look around,\u201d said Nikki Thompson, who has been a flight attendant on an international airline for four years. The strategy here is to bring panicking passengers back to the moment. She avoids putting any bad thoughts in their mind (Don\u2019t say things like \u201cThe train hasn\u2019t caught fire yet!\u201d). Instead, opt for something straightforward, such as, \u201c\u2018Right now your limbs are all intact. Everything around us is OK,\u2019\u201d Thompson suggests.\n\nA fight breaks out or a rider is belligerent\n\nDumb things happen all the time that can escalate into fights. Smith said she has seen two grown men get into full-on fisticuffs on an aeroplane in a fight that started over a cookie. When someone becomes aggressive like that, flight attendants switch into quick placation mode, which is a wise strategy for subway riders trapped in close quarters, too.\n\nFor stopping a fight on a train, the experts suggest a \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d method, gradually moving the riders back away from each other while working to defuse the situation.\n\n\u201cYou kind of act like an elementary school teacher or kindergarten teacher in those situations,\u201d said Karalee Mulder, who has eight years of experience on international and domestic airlines and created the blog The Flight Attendant Life. \u201cYou take an authoritative role a little bit.\u201d\n\nMost times, people are just angry and frustrated and want to be heard, she said. She will squat down to be on their level as she\u2019s speaking to them. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be standing above the passenger ever,\u201d she said. \u201cI always squat down, at eye level or lower, and just let them know that I\u2019m listening.\u201d\n\nOn the subway, you\u2019d want to sound calm but official and helpful, so the person you\u2019re talking to doesn\u2019t blow up in your face right away.\n\nThompson then goes into problem-solving mode. \u201cI have to figure out what it is they need. Where are they coming from? Are they scared of something?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it all boils down to, they\u2019re scared of the unknown.\u201d\n\nIf someone is truly dangerous, Smith recommends avoiding eye contact, which can escalate the situation, and putting something physically between yourself and the danger. Even a subway pole or an umbrella can help.\n\nSick passengers\n\nLike that old paper bag breathing trick, asking \u201cis there a doctor in the house?\u201d almost always works too. The density of New York City means the odds your train car will have a doctor, nurse, firefighter, EMT or anyone else with medical training on it is pretty good.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to actually speak up, to be the mouth that asks for a doctor,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt actually has worked out every time.\u201d\n\nIf a doctor isn\u2019t available and it\u2019s not clear what\u2019s wrong with them, ask them for medical history or look for a medical ID bracelet. If they can\u2019t speak, the flight attendants suggest looking for medicine in their bag.\n\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority's (MTA) official etiquette posters say that when you\u2019re feeling sick, you should get off the train at the next stop, or contact the conductor (or have someone do it for you), who will wait with you until help arrives.\n\nFIRE! FIRE!\n\nFires inside a subway car are rare, but the close quarters could make even a small one dangerous. Flight attendants said it\u2019s crucial to know which type of blaze you\u2019re dealing with first: combustible (clothing, paper, etc.), flammable liquid (oil, grease), or electrical (someone\u2019s laptop burst into flames).\n\nTo handle an electrical fire, flight attendants are trained to remove the power source first. You can\u2019t throw water on a grease or oil fire or the flames will just spread; it\u2019s best to use an extinguisher (which you probably won\u2019t have access to, unless you\u2019re this guy) or smother it safely, if possible. You can find the official guidelines here.\n\nFor a combustible fire, you should remove anything else that might go up in flames right away: loose clothing, newspapers, for example.\n\nBut when in doubt, your biggest priority should be to get away from the fire. Smoke is usually the biggest threat, not the flames themselves. If the subway car starts to fill with smoke, open windows and doors or move to another car ASAP. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get out of the train straight away if you could,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThough the MTA strictly advises against \u201cself-evacuating\u201d from their trains, well, it\u2019s been done before. (And you can find their official evacuation guidelines here, which describe four strategies for getting to safety.)\n\nImportant fact: The MTA says you should almost never pull the emergency cord, despite being in a situation you might consider an \u201cemergency. The MTA says to only use it to stop the train \u201cwhen the motion of the subway presents an imminent danger to life and limb.\u201d\n\nOnce the cord is pulled, brakes have to be reset before the train can move again, which in some cases can make the emergency at hand much, much worse.\n\nThe heat or air conditioning go kaput\n\nBad news to those passengers who were stuck in that steamy nightmare subway car video: flight attendants don\u2019t have much help for you.\n\nIf the air conditioning dies, they said your only option may be to get comfortable and loosen up any tight clothes, or to find something stiff to fan yourself with (on planes, they recommend the flight safety card).\n\nIf the heat kicks it while you\u2019re stuck in the dead of winter, it\u2019s time to make some friends and huddle together for warmth. \u201cI know it\u2019s not very New York of me to say this but you\u2019ve got to get to know the people next to you,\u201d Smith said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to freeze to death.\u201d\n\nLook for the mums\n\nWhen flight attendants are giving the safety spiel before a flight, they\u2019re not just going over important information: they\u2019re also surveying the crowd to see who might be helpful in an emergency. If shit goes down on the train and you need help, it\u2019s not always a beefy strong guy you should be looking for.\n\n\u201cParents, mums: they can be the coolest under pressure,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThey can take direction.\u201d", "description": "If you've never travelled on a New York City subway, and things start going south (the subway has its fair share of breakdowns and emergencies), it's important to keep a cool head.
