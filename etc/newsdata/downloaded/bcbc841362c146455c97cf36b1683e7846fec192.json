Quite a few players were face-to-face when the flag flew. Referee Mike Defee announced the penalty, and the warning of an ejection for any more unsportsmanlike calls.\n\nIt's the 115th meeting between the longtime rivals, and the 92nd at Cotton Bowl Stadium in the middle of the Texas state fair.\n\nDefee re-issued the warning to the captains during the coin flip: \"We're going to play this game with sportsmanship. Are we clear?\"\n\nThe teams ran to the same tunnel together after the flag was thrown, but there weren't any noticeable scuffles as OU players bunched up while the Longhorns went single file up the ramp.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
