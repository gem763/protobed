The White House said President Trump won't profit off the decision to host the summit at a Trump resort.\n\nAppearing on \"Outnumbered Overtime\" with anchor Julie Banderas, McCarthy said the decision could play into the impeachment inquiry that House Democrats are trying to wage against Trump.\n\nFLEISCHER: MICK MULVANEY MADE A 'TERRIBLE MISTAKE' BY CONTRADICTING THE PRESIDENT\n\n\"So, to give them this kind of grist to continue the investigations they're doing and to push courts for things like, you know, they're demanding the president's business records and tax records and all that stuff, it just seems to me he's giving them a gift,\" McCarthy said.\n\n\"It's asking to be investigated under circumstances where he's being investigated left, right and center,\" McCarthy added.\n\nThe decision to hold the G7 meeting at the Trump National Doral Golf Club was discussed for months, since Trump made a pitch to have next year\u2019s summit at the resort during August\u2019s G7 conference in France. Democrats concerns over the ethics of the president personally profiting off an official government event.\n\nDuring a rare White House press briefing, Mulvaney addressed concerns about potential \"emoluments violations\" and told reporters that Trump will not make any money off the event. He said the golf club will provide the location and services at cost.\n\nDEMS' EMOLUMENTS CLAUSE LAWSUIT AGAINST TRUMP HITS MAJOR ROADBLOCK, JUDGE RULES LAW 'UNSETTLED'\n\n\u201cThe president has made it clear that he doesn\u2019t profit from being here,\u201d Mulvaney said during the briefing. \u201cThe resort is doing it at cost. It\u2019s much cheaper to do it at Doral than at other sites [that were being considered].\"\n\nMulvaney said the Trump administration started with 12 potential sites to host the G7 summit, and advance teams that scouted locations came back with the suggestion to hold it at Doral.\n\n\u201cWe used the same set of criteria that other administrations used,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cIt became apparent at the end of that process that Doral was far and away, far and away, the best facility to host this conference.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed about any possible financial profit the president might make, Mulvaney said: \"Consider that Donald Trump\u2019s brand is strong enough as it is and doesn\u2019t need any help.\"\n\n\"The Trump family made their money before they went into politics,\" he added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO CHECK OUT THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' Andrew O'Reilly contributed to this report.", "description": "The Trump administration's decision to host next year's G7 summit at the Trump National Doral Golf Club was a \"real unforced error,\" Fox News contributor Andrew McCarthy said Friday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Andy-McCarthy-FOX.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
