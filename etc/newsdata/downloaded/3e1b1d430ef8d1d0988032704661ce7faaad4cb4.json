But if you depend heavily on your phone for day-to-day tasks and don\u2019t want to deal with what may be a buggy upgrade, caution may be the order of the day. Apple has promised that version 13.1, which will contain a number of bug fixes and new features, will be following shortly; in fact, the upgrade should be available on September 24th, just days after iOS 13 launches.\n\nIf you\u2019d rather be safe than sorry, then it\u2019s easy to avoid the iOS 13 update. All you have to do is turn off Automatic Updates.\n\nGo to Settings > General > Software Update\n\nIf the Automatic Updates setting is on (which it probably is), tap on it\n\nMove the toggle to the left (so that it\u2019s no longer green)\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Automatic Updates setting is now off. In 11 days (or whenever you hear from us that most of the bugs that came with iOS 13 have been swatted), you can just follow the same directions to turn Automatic Updates back on. Updates will once again be downloaded and installed overnight as long as your phone is connected to power and to Wi-Fi.", "description": "There have been reports from several Verge staff members that the new operating system has also resulted in a number of bugs.
