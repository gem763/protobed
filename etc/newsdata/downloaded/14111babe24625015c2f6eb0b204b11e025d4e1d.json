If this is true we have to be ashamed and we have to apologise but it has to be proven to be true.\u201d\n\nAt half-time of the game, Wright told ITV Sport: \"That says everything you need to know about UEFA.\n\n\"We're looking at a stadium where half of it's closed with banners, that's done nothing.\n\n\"That's the extent of what they are doing to tackle racism in this country. What we can see is there's certain people there that have no respect.\n\n(Image: Michael Zemanek/BPI/REX)\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's showing UEFA up for what they are. They're doing nowhere near enough, and I'm so proud that we're doing what we're doing at the moment.\"\n\nThey have now acted to punish Bulgaria again, this time opting for harsher sanctions.\n\nAfter the game, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin released a statement in which he vowed to 'eliminate the disease of racism\u2019.\n\nCeferin, who also defended UEFA\u2019s approach to fighting racism, declared: \u201cThere were times, not long ago, when the football family thought that the scourge of racism was a distant memory. The last couple of years have taught us that such thinking was, at best, complacent.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\u201cThe rise of nationalism across the continent has fuelled some unacceptable behaviour and some have taken it upon themselves to think that a football crowd is the right place to give voice to their appalling views.\n\n\"As a governing body, I know we are not going to win any popularity contests. But some of the views expressed about UEFA\u2019s approach to fighting racism have been a long way off the mark.\n\n\u201cUEFA, in close cooperation with the FARE network (Football Against Racism Europe), instituted the three-stage protocol for identifying and tackling racist behaviour during games.\n\n\u201cUEFA\u2019s sanctions are among the toughest in sport for clubs and associations whose supporters are racist at our matches. The minimum sanction is a partial closure of the stadium \u2013 a move which costs the hosts at least hundreds of thousands in lost revenue and attaches a stigma to their supporters.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\u201cUEFA is the only football body to ban a player for ten matches for racist behaviour \u2013 the most severe punishment level in the game.\n\n\u201cBelieve me, UEFA is committed to doing everything it can to eliminate this disease from football. We cannot afford to be content with this; we must always strive to strengthen our resolve.\n\n\"More broadly, the football family \u2013 everyone from administrators to players, coaches and fans \u2013 needs to work with governments and NGOs to wage war on the racists and to marginalise their abhorrent views to the fringes of society.\n\n\u201cFootball associations themselves cannot solve this problem. Governments too need to do more in this area.\n\n\u201cOnly by working together in the name of decency and honour will we make progress.\u201d", "description": "UEFA have announced the punishment for Bulgaria after the racist abuse suffered by England players in Sofia earlier this month", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Michael Zemanek Bpi Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20581066.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Bulgaria-v-England-UEFA-Euro-2020-Qualifier.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
