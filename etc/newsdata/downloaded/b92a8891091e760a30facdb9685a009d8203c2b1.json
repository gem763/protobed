'You need to know that you are in our hearts. We are here and you are not alone.'\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos embraces Jamal Khashoggi's fiancee Hatice Cengiz at a memorial event in Istanbul today, one year since the dissident Saudi journalist was murdered\n\nJeff Bezos and Hatice Cengiz stand over a new memorial stone for Khashoggi which was unveiled today, at a ceremony near the consulate in Istanbul where he was last seen alive\n\nThe memorial today began at 1.14pm, the time that Khashoggi was last seen alive when he entered the consulate.\n\nAt the ceremony today activists demanded a full UN investigation into the murder, which remains shrouded in mystery.\n\nThey also unveiled a memorial for Khashoggi, a former royal insider who had become a sharp critic of the Saudi regime.\n\nCengiz said she felt 'anxiety, fear and strange things that I cannot express' about returning to the site.\n\n'Last year, I was waiting for Jamal on my own. This year the whole world will be waiting with me for Jamal - but we will be waiting for justice for Jamal,' she said.\n\nKhashoggi was collecting paperwork related to the couple's planned marriage when he was killed.\n\nSaudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is widely suspected of ordering the killing, which was carried out by agents of the Saudi government.\n\nA UN report published in June said there was 'credible evidence' linking the crown prince to the killing.\n\nHatice Cengiz, pictured, returned to the place where she waited anxiously for Khashoggi to emerge from the Saudi consulate last year where he was collecting paperwork\n\nJeff Bezos, pictured left with Cengiz today, is the owner of the Washington Post where Khashoggi was a columnist\n\nJamal Khashoggi (pictured in Istanbul months before his death) was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul after entering the building one year ago today\n\nKhashoggi's body is believed to have been dismembered and his remains have never been found.\n\nAn audio recording of Khashoggi's final moments, heard by UN investigators, apparently reveals how his killers discussed cutting his body into pieces, before accosting Khashoggi who died amid 'sounds of a struggle'.\n\nIn a 99-page report, the UN's special investigator Agnes Callamard said experts found it 'inconceivable' that a sophisticated 15-man mission to kill Khashoggi could have happened without Prince Mohammed's knowledge.\n\nTwo of the alleged hit squad had used diplomatic passports, and that the encounter at the consulate was 'only possible because of the pretense of government service', she said.\n\nPrince Mohammed had allowed a wide-ranging crackdown on journalists and regime opponents in the past, she said.\n\nOn top of that, she said Saudi officials 'multiple steps apparently designed to destroy evidence' after Khashoggi's death.\n\nIn an interview this week Prince Mohammed said he took 'full responsibility' for Khashoggi's death, but denied that he ordered the murder.\n\nWashington Post owner Jeff Bezos, left, and Hatice Cengiz, right, applaud a speaker during today's memorial ceremony in Istanbul where Khashoggi died\n\nBezos and Cengiz stand over a memorial stone for Khashoggi in Istanbul today.
