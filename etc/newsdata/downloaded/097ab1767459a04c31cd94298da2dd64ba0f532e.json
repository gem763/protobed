The pound fell.\n\nDespite the progress made between European Union and U.K. negotiators in Brussels, the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Johnson\u2019s administration, raised concerns over three key sticking points.\n\nThese are: new arrangements for dealing with customs checks on goods crossing the the U.K.-Irish border; the mechanism for giving Northern Irish politicians a veto over those arrangements; and a lack of clarity on how to institute sales tax in the region.\n\n\u201cWe have been involved in ongoing discussions with the Government,\u201d DUP leader Arlene Foster said in a joint statement with her colleague Nigel Dodds. \u201cAs things stand, we could not support what is being suggested.\u201d\n\nThe DUP\u2019s support is seen as important to Johnson\u2019s chances of getting a deal ratified in the U.K. parliament. The party said it would continue to work with Johnson to seek an agreement.\n\nThe pound, which surged earlier this week on growing hopes of a deal, fell as much as 0.6% to $1.2750.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Tim Ross in London at tross54@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Flavia Krause-Jackson at fjackson@bloomberg.net, Richard Bravo\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Boris Johnson\u2019s Northern Irish allies warned they will not support his proposed Brexit deal, putting chances of an agreement in fresh doubt.
