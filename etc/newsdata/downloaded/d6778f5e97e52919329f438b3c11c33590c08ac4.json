Local media reports estimated the crowd to be about 1,500 people.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe protest centered on an Oct. 9 incident in which security guard Marlon Anderson, 48, responded to a call about a disruptive student at the high school. Anderson said the student, who is black, called him a series of epithets, including the N-word, to which Anderson responded that he should not be called those words.\n\nAnderson was fired under the high school\u2019s zero-tolerance policy regarding employees using racial slurs. The Madison teachers union reportedly filed a grievance with the district on his behalf.\n\nStudents have repeatedly used slurs with him, Anderson said, and past exchanges have produced \u201crestorative conversations\u201d regarding the history of the N-word.\n\nThe high school\u2019s principal, Karen Boran, has said its zero-tolerance policy has been applied across the board with all staffers. However, district school board president, Gloria Reyes, said the school\u2019s policy needs to be reviewed.\n\n\u201cThis is an incredibly difficult situation, and we acknowledge the emotion, harm and complexity involved,\u201d she said. \u201cMany people in our community and our district are grappling with that complexity, and we will continue to do so as we go forward.\u201d", "description": "Wisconsin high school students\u00a0walked out of classes on Friday and\u00a0held a demonstration in the state capital to protest the firing of a black security guard who had been fired for repeating a racial slur while telling a student to refrai", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/statecapitolbuildings_wisconsin_madison_122411getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
