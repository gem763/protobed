They presented a credit report with a high score. Their references checked out and they have two young children, so I thought that \u2026 it would be wonderful to be able to have the home used for a family,\" Selby said.\n\nEven-Har signed a 12-month, fixed-term lease for the home at 11 Clermont Cr. with rent at $2,000 per month, beginning in May.\n\nBut Selby said he hasn't been paid since June 1.\n\nNadav Even-Har signed a 12-month, fixed-term lease for Selby's home on Clermont Crescent in Cole Harbour. (CBC)\n\nThe postdated rent cheques were written from closed bank accounts.\n\nSelby said he's stuck in a legal morass that's has left him unable to access his home.\n\n\"I can't believe ... that's my reality. Like, I can't believe that I am paying for a home that I own and have owned for years and that I physically can't go into without permission,\" he said.\n\n\"I can't even begin to describe what it feels like to be rendered homeless from this situation.\"\n\nCoffee shop dreams\n\nSelby is in his early 30s and has owned the home for almost a decade.\n\nThe business graduate from Saint Mary's University spent several years working across Canada, selling inventory for gift shops, but eventually spotted an opportunity in Cole Harbour's commercial landscape.\n\n\"I can't be the only one that doesn't enjoy spending an hour to go to downtown Dartmouth to get a coffee ... so the idea of coffee and gifts I thought fit well together,\" Selby said.\n\nBringing the building up to commercial standards cost Jason Selby over $100,000 more than his initial estimate. (CBC)\n\nHis business, Selby's Bunker, is anything but bunker-like. It features big windows and high ceilings, with high-design caf\u00e9 tables and chairs, and a wall of coffee-themed gifts.\n\nBut bringing the building up to commercial standards cost Selby over $100,000 more than his initial estimate.\n\nNow he says he's carrying that debt, plus the mortgage on his home, with no rent to cover it off.\n\n\"Oh my gosh, stressed beyond belief ... I can't even begin to describe how it feels.\"\n\nEviction evasion\n\nWith Even-Har $8,000 behind in rent and the bounced cheques as proof, Selby obtained an eviction order on Sept. 3.\n\nEven-Har immediately appealed to Nova Scotia's Residential Tenancies board and the eviction was stayed until a court hearing on Sept. 23.\n\nSelby said Even-Har did not attend the hearing and the eviction notice was upheld.\n\nBut when Selby removed Even-Har's belongings from the home on Sept. 29, Even-Har called police.\n\nWith Even-Har $8,000 behind in rent, Selby obtained an eviction order using the bounced rent cheques as proof. (CBC)\n\n\"The police came, and they didn't accept my notice of vacant possession and they actually allowed him to ... enter the property through the basement window, and then they helped him move his things in,\" Selby said.\n\nA spokesperson for Nova Scotia's Justice Department said Even-Har went back to the court before the decision by the Residential Tenancies board was reflected in the computer.\n\nAnother stay order was issued. The spokesperson said that was a mistake.\n\nOnce the court admitted the stay order was issued in error, Selby moved fast.\n\nSheriffs evicted Even-Har and his family on Tuesday morning, but by Wednesday, the family was back in the home.\n\nEven-Har has appealed his eviction to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court and is now safe from eviction until the court date on Oct. 11.\n\nFacebook fury\n\nSelby has written several Facebook posts about the ordeal.\n\n\"I invite you to share this widely so that other landlords can beware (sic) and protect themselves,\" he wrote on Sept. 29.\n\nThat's when Selby heard from Lori Sampson of Cole Harbour. She said she had rented her home at 60 Tamara Dr. to Even-Har in August 2018.\n\nHe also gave her rent cheques from a closed bank account, said Sampson.\n\nLori Sampson of Cole Harbour rented her home on Tamara Drive to Even-Har in August 2018 and experienced similar problems. (CBC)\n\n\"Then he would give story after story about trying to get this money wired to him from overseas, and his company had a lien on him, and so you never got any money out of him,\" Sampson said.\n\nShe said Even-Har was charged with fraud for activating a bank card he stole from her mail, then paying nearly $2,000 on his cellphone bill.\n\n\"Nadav had not paid me one cent to rent my home, and was a complete nightmare to deal with,\" Sampson wrote in a complaint letter she drafted at the request of the RCMP.\n\nCourt records show Nadav Joseph Even-Har has several convictions for both theft and fraud.\n\nHe's currently being sentenced for an assault charge.\n\nOther landlords complain\n\nCBC News contacted two other landlords with similar stories about Even-Har.\n\nJaro Schubert owns a caf\u00e9 and Airbnb in Fall River, N.S. He said Even-Har owes him nearly $5,000 for rent and food dating back to this spring.\n\nNadav Even-Har, as seen in a photo uploaded to Facebook, declined to answer questions from CBC News about his dealings with the three landlords who say he owes them money. (Facebook)\n\nSchubert said Even-Har told him they had a flood in their home, and were having problems with the insurance company and contractors.\n\nAnother landlord, who asked not to be named, put the family up in his home for several months this year. He said he never saw the $350 monthly rent he was promised.\n\nEven-Har's response\n\nCBC News contacted Even-Har via email.\n\nHe declined to answer questions about his dealings with Selby, Sampson or Schubert.\n\n\"I can tell you this much that if anything sirs (sic) you and the station will be receiving a law suit (sic) immediately as Jason is,\" Even-Har wrote.\n\nSelby said: \"I've certainly learned a lot about our justice system, how little support there is for landlords who are in this situation and how easy it is for criminals to take advantage of laws and use them to cover themselves.\n\n\"I think it is so important that this has been put out there so that people can be aware and we can look out for each other.\"\n\nMORE TOP STORIES", "description": "Jason Selby of Cole Harbour, N.S., thought he had found the perfect tenants.\u00a0But according to Selby, since June 1, he has never been paid.
