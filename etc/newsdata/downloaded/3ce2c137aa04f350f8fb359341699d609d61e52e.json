It had climbed as high as $1.1034 in U.S. trade on Thursday, its strongest in almost three weeks.\n\nThat helped to send the dollar index to 98.709, a low last seen on Sept. 25.\n\nAlso undermining the dollar, data showed on Thursday U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in September and underlying inflation retreated, supporting expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in October.\n\nThe yen eased to 107.92 yen to the dollar, having shed about 0.45% the previous day.\n\nTop U.S. and Chinese negotiators wrapped up a first day of trade talks in more than two months on Thursday, as business groups expressed optimism the two sides might be able to ease a trade war and delay a U.S. tariff hike scheduled for next week.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump told reporters that his team had a \"very, very good negotiation with China,\" and reiterated his plans to meet with Liu at the White House on Friday.\n\n\"Prospect of an interim deal were also boosted overnight following reports that President Trump was planning to meet Vice Premier Liu He on Friday,\" Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank in Sydney, said in a report.\n\nThe Chinese yuan was also buoyed, with offshore yuan traded at 7.105 yuan per dollar, having hit a three-week high of 7.0990 to the dollar the previous day.
