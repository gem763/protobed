It\u2019s not about changing the regime. It\u2019s about changing the behavior of the leadership in Iran to comport with what the Iranian people really want them to do [bold mine-DL].\n\nIt is remarkably convenient that the things Pompeo says \u201cthe Iranian people really want them to do\u201d line up 100% with what the Trump administration wants Iran to do. Of course, Pompeo\u2019s assertion is wrong. It is risible and insulting that a member of the current administration claims to be speaking on behalf of the people of Iran after Trump has barred Iranians from coming to the U.S., reimposed punishing sanctions on their country, and reneged on a nuclear agreement that most of them supported. It is profoundly arrogant for our government to presume to know the preferences of the Iranian people better than they do, and this is all the more ridiculous when we realize how poorly this administration understands Iran or any foreign country.\n\nIn fact, most Iranians don\u2019t support Pompeo\u2019s demands or the administration\u2019s goals for Iran according to the best information that we have. On the contrary, the January 2018 survey conducted by the Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland (CISSM) and IranPoll found broad Iranian public support for many of the things that Pompeo insists that the Iranian government stop doing. According to the survey, 51% of Iranians disagree that the \u201cgovernment should spend less money in places like Syria and Iraq.\u201d 61% disagree with the statement \u201cIran\u2019s current level of involvement in Iraq and Syria is not in Iran\u2019s national interests.\u201d 75% disagree with the statement \u201cIran\u2019s political system needs to undergo fundamental change.\u201d 64% disagree that the \u201cmilitary should spend less much money on developing missiles,\u201d and 70% said that \u201cIran should not agree to stop developing advanced missiles.\u201d 73% think it is very important for Iran to develop missiles. 56% said that Iran should continue missile testing and should consider this issue to be non-negotiable.\n\n75% also said that it was very important for Iran to develop its nuclear program, and 54% still approved of the JCPOA as of four months ago. 64% said that \u201cIran should not agree to increase the duration of the limits it has accepted under the JCPOA under any circumstances.\u201d It doesn\u2019t sound as if most Iranians are eager for their government to capitulate on these points. If the Iranian government agreed to any of Pompeo\u2019s demands on the nuclear issue, missiles, or Iranian foreign policy, it would be taking unpopular actions to mollify a deeply disliked and distrusted foreign government. That\u2019s obviously not happening.\n\nUnsurprisingly, most Iranians don\u2019t favor having their government abandon its allies, disarm, and dismantle their nuclear program. It is also not surprising that this administration doesn\u2019t know or care about any of this, and their feigned interest in what the Iranian people want is just a way of disguising their unremitting hostility. That hostility is hard to miss, and 69% of respondents characterized the Trump administration\u2019s policies towards Iran as \u201ccompletely hostile\u201d and another 15% saw them at least somewhat hostile. Less than 2% of Iranians thought that the administration\u2019s policies were in any way friendly. Iranians aren\u2019t buying that a government that bans, sanctions, and threatens them is on their side, and there is no reason why they would. That\u2019s why a staggering 93% of Iranians hold an unfavorable view of the U.S. government.\n\nThe Trump administration isn\u2019t really interested in helping the people of Iran, and the vast majority wouldn\u2019t want our government\u2019s help in any case. The administration\u2019s efforts to dictate terms to Iran have nothing to do with trying to benefit the people of Iran, and most Iranians oppose those efforts.", "description": "", "authors": ["Daniel Larison"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shutterstock_749870395-1.jpg", "published_at": "2018-05-25"}
