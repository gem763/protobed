Among riders that did leave a tip, the average tip came to just above $3 dollars, or about 26% of the ride fare. Including rides without tips, that average falls to just 50 cents.\n\nAccording to the paper\u2019s lead researcher and former Uber employee Bharat Chandar, part of the reason why riders tip so infrequently might have to do with the custom not always being built into the platform from the beginning.\n\nAccording to the study posted to the National Bureau of Economic Research, nearly 60% of Uber riders never tip. For riders that did leave a tip, the average tip was about $3, according to the study. More\n\n\u201cThis could be a consequence of different norms and cultural expectations in the two settings \u2014 Uber did not encourage riders to tip in the earlier days of the app,\u201d he wrote in a blog post discussing the study\u2019s results. \u201cIt could also be because the tipping decision is made privately on Uber after the ride is over, whereas in many other contexts the tipping decision is more public, adding social pressure to the decision.\u201d\n\nThe study was unique in the sheer size of its dataset, which included info on 40 million rides from all over the U.S. during the summer of 2017 after Uber shifted to allow riders to tip drivers. (The paper\u2019s researchers included two former Uber employees aside from Chandar, including a former chief economist, who both jumped ship to join ride-sharing rival Lyft.)\n\nThe study also found that men tipped about 12% to 17% more than women, on average, and suggested a strong correlation between rider rating and providing more in tips. Male riders were also more seemingly impacted by the age and gender of the driver when it came to deciding what tip to leave.\n\n\u201cMen tip younger women about seven cents more on average than older women (roughly a 14% increase, give or take), while they tip younger men about 3 cents more than older men,\u201d Chandar wrote. \u201cFemale riders tend to not vary tips as much based on the age of the driver.\u201d\n\nThe average expected tip for Uber drivers declines as the age of the driver increases, according to the NBER study. (Bharat Chandar) More\n\nInterestingly, the study found that female drivers were tipped about 13% more on average, driven mostly by a higher percentage of trips receiving a tip (women received tips nearly 10% more often than men.)\n\nTipping bias\n\nThat finding echoes the reason Uber previously cited for refraining from adding tipping as a feature for riders when it first launched. The company published a post on blogging site Medium in 2016 that defended that decision by noting that adding tipping to the platform could result in drivers receiving unequal compensation for the same amount of work, due to a \u201cpersonal bias\u201d on the part of riders.\n\n\u201cWhether consciously or unconsciously, we tend to tip certain types of people better than others,\u201d the company\u2019s post said. Uber eventually made the change to allow riders to tip in 2017.\n\nNoting that it has been two years since the time period analyzed, the researchers noted that tipping behavior on the platform may have changed over that time. However, the study also found that tipping was negatively correlated with more experienced riders. For example, riders clocking 15 lifetime rides or less tipped nearly 25% of the time, and averaged a $3.34 tip. In comparison, more experienced riders (those clocking more than 275 lifetime rides or more) tipped just 8% of the time, and when they did, the tip only averaged $2.69. The takeaway? Riders tip less as they take more Uber trips.\n\nProvided that finding has less to do with the fact that tipping was a relatively new feature during the window of behavior studied and more to do with Americans becoming more comfortable with not tipping their drivers, it might not bode well for drivers looking forward to tips.", "description": "When it comes to getting tips, Uber drivers are getting stiffed, according to a new study.", "authors": ["Zack Guzman", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AwHi4UpmHU9832c4ebqWLQ--~B/aD0xOTgyO3c9MjQ2OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/d9b7dd80-f5a7-11e9-bfd4-c457de4d3365", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
