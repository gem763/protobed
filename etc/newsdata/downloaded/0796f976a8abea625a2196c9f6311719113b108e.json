A good question is how its governance structure got so messed up in the first place.\n\nThe We Company, better known by the name of its coworking brand WeWork, is shaking up its governance structure ahead of its hoped-for initial public offering. The deeply unprofitable, cash-hungry company\u2019s anti-democratic voting structure has drawn censure from the investing public in the form of valuation cuts.\n\nSubscribe to the Crunchbase Daily\n\nWhen added to the company\u2019s widely-condemned self-dealing by its CEO Adam Neumann, WeWork had set a high watermark for self-inflicted wounds ahead of an IPO. (Don\u2019t forget the CEO\u2019s large pre-IPO cashouts as well.)\n\nNow the company is working to unwind the mistakes, according to its latest SEC filing. If the changes will be enough to alter the narrative surrounding the We IPO isn\u2019t clear. The following steps, however, are pointed in the right direction.\n\nHere\u2019s our digest of what The We Company is changing:\n\nThe appointment \u201cof a lead independent director\u201d in 2019;\n\nReducing the voting rights of select stock from 20 votes per share to 10;\n\nMaintenance of a board that is made up of \u201cmajority [\u2026] independent directors,\u201d and no members of the CEO\u2019s family will serve on the board;\n\nGreater board diversity;\n\nThe CEO will give the company \u201cany profits he receives from the real estate transactions he has entered into with the company;\u201d\n\nReductions in the CEO\u2019s ability to sell shares after the IPO to \u201cno more than 10% of his shareholdings\u201d in the second and third years following the offering.\n\nPreviously the CEO promised to give back the payment he received for WeWork\u2019s use of the \u201cWe\u201d trademark that he inexplicably owned, and decided to charge his own company for access to; it\u2019s been a wild run for WeWork, one of the worst-run companies I\u2019ve ever read an S-1 from, judging the company from a corporate governance perspective.\n\nI doubt that the above will salvage WeWork\u2019s IPO valuation to a SoftBank-approved figure. But it\u2019s worth recalling that all of the above was predictable and unnecessary. The company didn\u2019t have to get into this mess. It was poorly managed into this situation.\n\nFor startups the lesson in the above is clear. If you aren\u2019t growing at 100 percent per year while generating GAAP profits and positive cash flow, maybe drop the supervoting stock and build a company with regular checks and balances. Those things are best practices for a reason. Your unicorn is not unique.\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman.", "description": "", "authors": ["Alex Wilhelm"], "top_image": "https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MMfeature.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
