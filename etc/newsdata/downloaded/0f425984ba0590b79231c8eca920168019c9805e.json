The Track 1 Cases assert various claims related to the opioid business operated by SpecGx LLC.\n\nPer the terms, Mallinckrodt will pay a total sum of $24 million in cash and donate $6 million to the generic business, which includes addiction treatment products. The agreement also requires a $500,000 payment in two years in recognition of the counties' time and expenses.\n\nMoreover, Mallinckrodt has agreed that the two plaintiff counties will receive the value, which would have been received under such a resolution in the event of a comprehensive resolution of government-related opioid claims.\n\nThe resolution comes as a major relief for Mallinckrodt\u2019s shares. The shares have plunged 84.7% year to date compared with the industry\u2019s decline of 7% due to pricing pressure in the generic segment and the rising menace of penalties regarding opioid litigations.\n\nMallinckrodt's shares depreciated after a Bloomberg report suggested that the company may file bankruptcy to limit its liabilities related to the pending opioid litigations. Per the report, the company hired restructuring advisers to explore options to avoid the MDL. Earlier, allegations against its lead drug Acthar\u2019s previous owner, Questcor, for conducting illegal sales and marketing activities related to the drug negatively impacted Mallinckrodt\u2019s shares.\n\nApart from Mallinckrodt, many pharma companies like Endo International ENDP and Teva Pharma TEVA are embroiled in multiple opioid litigations filed by several states, counties and political subdivisions in the United States regarding the abuse of opioid-based drugs. The industry players are accused of faulty marketing practices, which downplayed addiction risks from these drugs and spurred their consumption instead.\n\nLast month, Endo too executed a definitive settlement agreement with the County of Cuyahoga, Ohio; the County of Summit, Ohio; and certain related persons in connection with the lawsuits pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.\n\nEarlier, Johnson & Johnson JNJ received an unfavorable ruling in the court case filed by the state authorities of Oklahoma, pertaining to the abuse of its opioid-based drugs.\n\nMallinckrodt currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
