Boris Johnson's government insists it is willing to make concessions to resolve the ongoing difficulties over the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. But EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier says a \"big gap\" remains over what to do about customs arrangements.\n\nThe government wants a deal in place by Saturday, when there's a special session of Parliament. If MPs don't agree to one by then - or they back no-deal - Mr Johnson will be legally bound to ask the EU to delay Brexit beyond the 31 October deadline.\n\nThe schedule is tight. And if that wasn't enough to preoccupy ministers this week, the State Opening of Parliament takes places today. The Queen's Speech, which outlines the government's priorities, will contain 22 bills, relating to Brexit, crime prevention and immigration among other subjects. Here's what's likely to be in it.\n\n\"Strap yourself in - it could be a bumpy few days,\" writes BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley.

Now the Syrian government has announced it is deploying forces there, having made a deal with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nIn a separate development, nearly 800 relatives of Islamic State members have reportedly escaped from a camp.\n\nDespite threats of economic sanctions by the US, Turkey says the operation - which it argues is needed to prevent terrorism - will go on.

But East Germans fed up with communism poured into the streets of Leipzig, despite extraordinary restrictions on their personal freedom.\n\n\"We didn't have a phone at home - we weren't allowed, and they would have been listening in any case,\" recalls Katrin Hattenhauer, one of the organisers of the demonstrations.\n\nA candle-lit mass protest on 9 October became the turning point: a crowd of 70,000 thronged the city centre and for the first time dared to march past the feared headquarters of the Stasi secret police. \"We are the people!\" they chanted. \"Wir sind das Volk!\"\n\nRead the full article\n\nWhat the papers say\n\nThe Financial Times says Boris Johnson's Brexit plan is \"baffling\" the EU, while the Daily Telegraph reports that EU negotiators are demanding more concessions from the PM before a deal can be reached.
