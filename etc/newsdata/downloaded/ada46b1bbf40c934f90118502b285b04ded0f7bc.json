And, when a friend and colleague left FEMA, the executive helped her get a job at Cobra Energy LLC, authorities said.\n\n\u201cThese defendants were supposed to come to Puerto Rico to help during the recovery after the devastation suffered from Hurricane Maria,\u201d Rosa Emilia Rodr\u00edguez-V\u00e9lez, the U.S. attorney for Puerto Rico, said in a statement announcing the indictment. \u201cInstead, they decided to take advantage of the precarious conditions of our electric power grid and engaged in a bribery and honest services wire fraud scheme in order to enrich themselves illegally.\u201d\n\nThose charged were Ahsha Nateef Tribble, a FEMA deputy regional administrator who authorities described as the leader in power restoration in Puerto Rico; Jovanda R. Patterson, a FEMA deputy chief of staff who left her position in July 2018 to work for Cobra Energy; and Donald Keith Ellison, who was president of Cobra Acquisitions until June.\n\nBill Leone, a lawyer for Ellison, said the indictment \u201ccriminalizes normal business and personal relationships that are not criminal under the law, no matter how far you stretch it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t bribe anyone, and we look forward to getting in to court to establish that he didn\u2019t bribe anybody,\u201d Leone said.\n\n\u201cI think Keith deserves as much or more credit than any person on the planet for getting electricity restored in Puerto Rico, despite all the obstacles created by many layers of government bureaucracy, and I do believe he is the victim of a blame game that is underway in Puerto Rico, and Washington.\u201d\n\nBridget Moore, an attorney for Tribble, said, \u201cI look forward to vindicating our client, and bringing to light the details of how this investigation has been handled by the government.\u201d\n\nTimothy D. Belevetz, a lawyer for Patterson said, \u201cJovanda has spent nearly all of her career in selfless service to her country, both in uniform and as a civilian, often in areas ravaged by natural disasters. She did not commit the offenses she has been charged with, and we are looking forward to challenging the government\u2019s allegations at trial.\u201d\n\nPuerto Rico after Maria\n\nPuerto Rico is still recovering from Hurricane Maria, the catastrophic Category-4 storm that left more than 3 million residents without power. The wreckage created what is believed to be the longest blackout in U.S. history, contributing to the deaths of thousands who needed access to electricity to run lifesaving equipment such as dialysis machines and breathing devices. It took nearly a year to restore power to a majority of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\u2019s customers.\n\n\u201cCorruption in the ranks of DHS and FEMA won\u2019t be tolerated,\u201d said Department of Homeland Security Inspector General Joseph V. Cuffari.\n\nOfficials poured billions of dollars into repairing the power grid, though even now, officials say it remains fragile. Tribble arrived in Puerto Rico in October to direct recovery efforts related to the island\u2019s bankrupt public utility and the hurricane-ravaged power grid. The restoration project was hampered early on by scandal after the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the island\u2019s power company, awarded a contract to a little-known, two-person firm out of Montana called Whitefish Energy to rebuild the grid.\n\nAfter that contract was withdrawn, Cobra, a subsidiary of Mammoth Energy, became one of three stateside companies to win federal money to replace transmission towers, erect power poles and restring power lines across Puerto Rico.\n\nRep. Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez (D-N.Y.) said the investigation shows that corruption may have been a factor in the slow federal response.\n\n\u201cIf proven,\u201d Vel\u00e1zquez said in a statement, \u201cthis misuse of funds suggests that, while our fellow citizens on the Island were dying from a lack of electricity, private companies stateside were plotting how to illicitly profit at taxpayers\u2019 expense.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general found that when Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority entered into a 12-month contract with Cobra, FEMA was \u201cunsound\u201d in its evaluation of the company\u2019s eligibility, and the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the costs estimated for the work were inaccurate, according to a report released in July. FEMA\u2019s analysis of Cobra\u2019s labor rates, equipment costs and fees \u201cwere not always logical, complete, and supported,\u201d the report said. The firm at one point had roughly 600 people working on the island.\n\nIn a 48-page indictment, federal prosecutors said that Tribble exerted her authority in various ways to ensure Cobra got government work \u2014 and that local officials accepted the costs Cobra billed. In one instance, after an explosion left several municipalities without electricity, prosecutors said, Tribble pressed Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority executives to let Cobra fix the problem even though the executives believed that would increase costs. They billed more than $600,000 for the repairs, according to the indictment.\n\nExplosion in Puerto Rico knocks out power, emphasizing grid\u2019s frailty after Hurricane Maria\n\nMeanwhile, Tribble reaped the rewards, prosecutors contend. In January 2018, she inquired with Ellison about hotels in New York, and on Feb. 11 she asked for help finding a place to live there and prioritizing her needs about location, safety and furnishings. Ellison replied three days later saying \u201cyes ma\u2019am, I got it and have somebody on it already,\u201d according to the indictment. Tribble\u2019s note came on the day of the explosion.\n\nLeone, Ellison\u2019s lawyer, said that a review of Cobra\u2019s costs by the Rand Corp. found them to be \u201creasonable,\u201d that multiple officials oversaw all of the work, and that the lucrative contracts were awarded before Ellison met Tribble. He said Cobra was \u201cthe only contractor willing to work on credit,\u201d and while federal officials would sometimes press to get their invoices paid, that was not the result of bribes.\n\n\u201cPeople would get involved sometimes to get the bills paid, but to say that that was somehow a result of him trying to help her find a place in New York one time is ridiculous,\u201d Leone said.\n\nTribble and Ellison communicated on private email and disposable, prepaid cellphones, federal prosecutors said, about work and personal matters. The two were caught on surveillance video gambling together at a Puerto Rico casino, prosecutors said.\n\nProsecutors said Ellison lied to the FBI and Department of Homeland Security inspector general about the nature of his relationship with Tribble, which he claimed was purely related to work.\n\nTribble has been suspended from FEMA but not terminated, according to a spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Puerto Rico. In a statement, a FEMA spokesman said Tribble was \u201cin a non-duty, non-pay status.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we defer to the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General on specific questions regarding the indictment, generally employees in that status may not conduct official business on behalf of the federal government,\u201d the spokesman said. The agency also said it was \u201cfully cooperating with federal investigators.\u201d\n\nPeter Mirijanian, spokesman for Mammoth Energy Services, said: \u201cMammoth is aware of and has been cooperating with the government\u2019s investigation into Ms. Tribble and Mr. Ellison and will continue to do so.\u201d\n\nCobra is a subsidiary of Mammoth Energy Services, an Oklahoma-based oil-field services firm. Forty-nine percent of the parent company, Mammoth, is owned by Wexford Capital, an investment firm in Greenwich, Conn.\n\nNews of Cobra\u2019s work for Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority helped drive up the company\u2019s stock. It hit a peak of $40.88 a share on June 22, 2018, but the share price has plunged 90 percent since then, wiping out more than $1 billion in market value. Analysts following the company slashed price targets in June, citing the completion of Cobra\u2019s work.\n\nIn addition to bringing criminal charges, prosecutors moved to seize more than $48 million in several bank accounts under Ellison\u2019s name, a 40-foot catamaran, and other vehicles and equipment.\n\nJulie Tate contributed to this report.", "description": "One official got airfare and hotel stays in exchange for steering work to a company that received $1.8 billion in contracts, prosecutors said.", "authors": ["Matt Zapotosky", "National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department", "Arelis R.
