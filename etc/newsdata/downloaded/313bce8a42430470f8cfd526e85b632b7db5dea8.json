Though Halloween has a lot to answer for, it would be unfair to rest all blame for the rise of fancy dress on its shoulders \u2013 the rise, and fall, and zombie-stripper-like rise. Fancy dress refuses to die.\n\nWhich is odd because, of course, it should have faded away many times, swept into the bin of the British past like Gentleman\u2019s Relish or coatigans, most memorably after, haha, the pictures of Prince Harry as a Nazi. In 2005, he wore a German desert uniform and a swastika armband to a friend\u2019s birthday party in Wiltshire, which had the fancy dress theme \u201ccolonial and native\u201d. Imagine even writing the words on your Paperless Post. Dragging your fingers from key to key as a voice inside you screamed: \u201cBUT ARE YOU SURE?\u201d\n\nSince then adults have screwed up fancy dress so many times, and with such comic ignorance, that recent revelations \u2013 that Justin Trudeau wore blackface not once, or twice, but three times, revealing it to be his signature look; and that Atlantic Records boss Ben Cook (who is white) resigned after being reprimanded for attending a \u201cmusical icons\u201d party as a member of Run-DMC \u2013 are surely mere drops in the fancy dress ocean. Right now, a boy from Eton is humming as he lays out his Grenfell costume on the bed, and a woman in Bray is perfecting her hair before she debuts her Sexy Anne Frank.\n\nWhen else do you get to have sex in your mother's wedding dress?\n\nShow me an adult\u2019s costume party and I will show you a room of rich people in trouble. Out of 30, at least one will expose their extreme politics through an ill-advised accessory, at least five will be wearing 3D versions of the masks they\u2019ve been hiding behind for the last 20 years, thus revealing the flimsiness of their identity \u2013 and the rest will be merrily performing a sexuality they formed in front of Eurotrash one Friday night in 1994. One man will be extremely scary, misunderstanding the boundaries between fun and psychopathy. One woman will be extremely naked, misunderstanding the boundaries between knickers and arse. And so gender will be defined in this town for another year. The party themes are telling, their casual \u201cisms\u201d, whether race or sex, revealing more about the party-thrower than any music playlist. Sexualised animals will roam the live-work space with a raspberry beer, free of the true sex characteristics of their species, such as barbed penises or the inclination to eat their lover\u2019s head after mating.\n\nBut I get it. Largely. I\u2019ve put the time in, from a distance. Made in Chelsea, my primary anthropological source for the evolution of fancy dress, rotated around a series of extravagant costume parties designed to provide a theatre for the themed drama within. You get a whole new understanding of class when a drink\u2019s thrown over someone dressed as a swan, and when else do you get to have sex in your mother\u2019s wedding dress?\n\nThough I came of age in the time of ironic 70s disco nights, I was never tempted, perhaps because my daily outfits were often mistaken for fancy dress. Returning to London after college, I met people who\u2019d graduated from university with honours in cultural appropriation through the application of bindis. Their legendary themed parties dripped over whole weekends into their 20s, into fields, and nightclubs and someone\u2019s mum\u2019s house, where wealthy blonde law graduates and trainee doctors would gather for another opportunity to get off with a stranger covered in blood.\n\nAt Halloween they unsheath their costumes again, either squeezing into the glittery memories of their past or designing a cutting piece of topical cultural commentary assembled off the internet. This year, expect to see Inspector WAG, Naughty Activist, Greased Piglet, Brexit Bad Boy, The Death of Print Media, Plastic Wasteman, and The Only Person That Came To Work In Costume. And, on the one hand, let them have their fun. On the other, for Christ\u2019s sake, you know? It\u2019s like five pints or a pill \u2013 if the only way you can work up the courage to dance or flirt or truly express your feelings on the future is by dressing up as a Love Island casualty then, love, I urge you to talk to someone.\n\nGiven the opportunity I would ban fancy dress for the over-10s. Standing in line waiting for my kid to have her face painted this weekend, the requests ahead of us bounced gloriously from \u201cmagic unicorn with talking powers\u201d to \u201cElsa skeleton\u201d. The subtext for kids\u2019 costumes is political in a way that adults will never understand, but there is no expectation that a fancy hat will release them from the heavy anchor of humanity. They just want to be a pirate for a bit.\n\nEmail Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter@EvaWiseman", "description": "This Halloween expect to see Naughty Activist, Brexit Bad Boy \u2013 and zombie strippers that, just like fancy dress, refuse to die", "authors": ["Eva Wiseman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34a782187602313989bef73bbd5120d646cda5ea/19_180_3790_2275/master/3790.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0c42a92dbadf982397ed454a37377ff2", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
