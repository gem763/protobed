I got a lot of heated and angry feedback from a lot of folks for it. While I don\u2019t retract or regret anything I wrote, I do regret something I didn\u2019t write.\n\nI think there are legitimate areas for concern about the way Google, Facebook, and Twitter have a double standard about what voices they want to silence. The recent effort by Google to deny the Claremont Institute the ability to advertise its gala was ridiculous. Facebook\u2019s blocking of Prager University videos was absurd. And I\u2019m glad Facebook apologized.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the fact that they apologized points to the fact that while many of these platforms clearly have biases \u2014 often encoded in bad algorithms \u2014 points to the possibility that these behemoths aren\u2019t actually conspiring to \u201csilence\u201d all conservatives. They\u2019re just making boneheaded mistakes based in groupthink, bias, and ignorance.\n\nThe argument from many on my friends on the right about this issue often just boils down to argumentum ad slippery slopum. Social-media companies must allow every reprehensible figure out there to spew garbage because if we don\u2019t they\u2019ll come for us next. It\u2019s not necessarily a ridiculous argument, allowing maximum freedom is one way to protect vital freedoms. This used to be the ACLU\u2019s argument for allowing Nazis to march past Holocaust victims. It\u2019s still the argument for Second Amendment defenders, who say any additional regulations are just an excuse to move the ball downfield toward gun bans and the like.\n\nBut the NRA\u2019s argument always struck me as more empirically grounded than the old ACLU\u2019s. We know that large swaths of gun-control proponents want to get to the Australian model \u2014 because they say so all the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI just don\u2019t think efforts at censorship work the same way. Sometimes censoring A does not lead to censoring B or C or D, never mind Z. The slippery slope isn\u2019t a hidden teleological or dialectical force, it\u2019s a function of practical political combat. And that means meaningful distinctions can be made. Conservatives and libertarians (as do many liberals) often fall into the habit of arguing that every expansion of government power yields an equal reduction in liberty. It can work like that, in some specific areas it obviously does. But in others it simply doesn\u2019t. For instance, the Federal Government has grown massively in size and scope over the last century and half. In that time, slavery was ended, Jim Crow laws repealed, women granted the vote and countless industries deregulated or de-monopolized.\n\nSimilarly, First Amendment freedoms have greatly expanded over the last 50 \u2014 never mind 200 \u2014 years. Obscenity laws have all but vanished in the name of free expression (prompting the famous line from Irving Kristol: \u201cThe liberal paradigm of regulation and license has led to a society where an 18-year-old girl has the right to public fornication in a pornographic movie \u2014 but only if she is paid the minimum wage.\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the expansion of free-expression rights in one sphere didn\u2019t protect free-speech rights in other spheres. Indeed, efforts to regulate political speech often increased even as restrictions on peripheral speech decreased. We got a lot more freedom of expression for strippers and flag burners but got a lot less for political parties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, there is no mystical transitive property that guarantees that when the censoring of some speech leads to a cancer-like spread of more censorship. Germany bans Nazi propagandizing, this hasn\u2019t led to a Teutonic Fahrenheit 451. In America we aggressively censor child pornography without triggering a slippery slope. I for one find the argument \u201cFirst they came for the pedophiles free-speech rights, but I did nothing for I am not a fan of kiddie porn . . . \u201d to be utterly ridiculous.\n\nOne angry critic lectured me about how censorship based on \u201cideas\u201d is always terrible regardless of the idea. That might be true when it comes to the government, it\u2019s nonsense when it comes to the private sector. Rich Lowry has unilateral authority to \u201ccensor\u201d anyone from the pages of National Review. Facebook, Twitter, and Google are far more capacious of what they will tolerate on their platforms, in part because they have a very different business model. But they still have a right to refuse service to people using their gizmos and microphones to spew stuff they don\u2019t like. Apple has always banned porn from its platforms, porn freedoms have hardly been curtailed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore to the point, people like Alex Jones and Laura Loomer aren\u2019t trafficking in ideas so much as monetizable lies. Calling the Sandy Hook shooting a \u201cfalse-flag operation\u201d for clicks is grotesque. I am at a loss as to why I must man the parapets to defend their right to spread lies. The greatest of all defenses for any statement is truth. That\u2019s true in philosophy and libel law alike. Now what constitutes the truth is often a debatable thing, which is why a wide tolerance for different opinions and ideas is desirable. Tolerance for bad ideas does not require support for deliberate lies. And even if you disagree with that, the argument that the solution to the problems with Facebook et al is to make government the de facto content editor strikes me as batty.\n\nThat said, I very much like David French\u2019s argument for having social-media platforms adopt a policy rooted in First Amendment standards in making these decisions. I\u2019m not sure I would agree with all of the results from such a policy, but it would be better than what we have now.", "description": "I tackled the issue of \u201cdeplatforming\u201d on social media.
