Earlier this year, the French ambassador to Italy was recalled after then Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio (now the foreign minister) met with a leader of the Yellow Jackets protest movement.\n\nEven though the 5Stars are still in power, it's no longer with the far-right League of Matteo Salvini, and that's resulted in a major improvement in relations. On Wednesday night, Macron was greeted with a military fanfare in the courtyard of the Chigi Palace, Conte's official residence.\n\nDuring a short address to the press, Conte and Macron said migration is of the utmost importance for the whole EU and Southern European countries, such as Italy, can't be allowed to deal with it alone.\n\nDespite the smiles, some differences remain. Earlier in the day, Italian government officials said Rome wants to find a solution that means migrants are no longer automatically disembarked at the closest safe port but that other countries open their ports on a rotating basis. However, a French government official said what they want is a \"stable, predictable, automatic mechanism\" without scrapping disembarkation at the closest port, \"which is very important for legal and humanitarian reasons.\"\n\nConte said he and Macron discussed ideas for \"an efficient system to disembark, redistribute, and repatriate migrants.\"\n\n\"We must make sure the issue of migration isn't left to those that use it as a permanent topic for their propaganda,\" he added, likely referring to Salvini and Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's far-right National Rally.\n\nHowever, both Conte and Macron supported an argument long put forward by the far right; that the EU needs bilateral agreements with African nations in order to automatically repatriate economic migrants.\n\n\"We must guarantee the respect of asylum rights for those who qualify and we must also make sure that those that don't qualify as such are immediately repatriated,\" said Macron.\n\nThe idea of repatriating economic and illegal migrants through accords with countries of origin was one of Salvini's biggest promises to voters, but during his 14 months as interior minister, he struggled to achieve his goal, in part because the migrants were often undocumented and because very few bilateral agreements are in place with African countries.\n\n\"I don't underestimate what Italians have lived through since [the height of the migration crisis in] 2015 which is why I strongly believe the solution to the migration phenomenon lies in the construction of European solutions,\" the French president said.\n\nInterior ministers from Italy, France, Malta and Finland (which currently holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU) will meet on September 23 in Valletta to discuss migration.\n\nRym Momtaz contributed reporting.", "description": "The French president and the Italian prime minister agreed to work together on migration.", "authors": ["Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/h_55477091-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
