The session low\n\nwas $52.84 a barrel, the lowest since Aug. 9.\n\nBrent crude futures lost 40 cents, or 0.7%, to\n\nsettle at $58.26 a barrel. It sank as low as $57.23 a barrel,\n\nalso the weakest since Aug. 9.\n\nPrices extended losses following data that showed U.S.\n\nmanufacturing activity in August contracted for the first time\n\nin three years. Earlier, separate data showed euro\n\nzone manufacturing activity contracted for a seventh month in\n\nAugust. \"That deterioration is continuing to undermine the demand\n\ngrowth outlook for oil,\" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again\n\nCapital in New York.\n\nOil prices have fallen around 20% since a 2019 peak reached\n\nin April, hit by concerns the trade war would dent oil demand.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that trade talks\n\nbetween the United States and China were going well, though he\n\nwarned he would be \"tougher\" in negotiations if discussions drag\n\non until his second term. Trump said the two sides\n\nwould meet for talks this month.\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He said China firmly opposes a\n\ntrade war, the state news agency Xinhua reported. Washington began imposing 15% tariffs on an array of Chinese\n\nimports on Sunday, while China began placing new duties on U.S.\n\ncrude oil.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade dispute \"is the single most important\n\nflat price driver of late,\" said Tamas Varga of oil brokerage\n\nPVM.\n\nOn the supply side, Venezuela's oil exports fell in August\n\nto their lowest level in 2019, internal reports and Refinitiv\n\nEikon data showed, following tougher U.S. sanctions.\n\nRussian oil production C-RU-OUT in August rose to 11.294\n\nmillion barrels per day (bpd), data showed on Monday, hitting\n\nits highest since March and topping the rate Moscow pledged\n\nunder a pact with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting\n\nCountries (OPEC).\n\n\"Downside price pressures were accentuated today by weekend\n\nindications that OPEC had lifted production in August on a\n\nmonth-to-month basis for the first time this year while Russia\n\nis reportedly producing beyond agreed upon quota,\" Jim\n\nRitterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a\n\nnote.\n\nData due this week on U.S. inventory levels will be delayed\n\nby a day to Wednesday and Thursday because of the U.S. Labor Day\n\nholiday on Monday.\n\nOil prices are likely to remain range-bound for the\n\n\"foreseeable future\" and there will be little spending growth in\n\nNorth American oil and gas fields in the near to medium term,\n\nLorenzo Simonelli, chief executive of General Electric Co's\n\nBaker Hughes BHGE.N said.
