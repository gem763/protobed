In another recent case, doctors recalled a time they treated an Israeli woman for so-called \"broken heart syndrome\" after she ate a large amount of wasabi, assuming it was avocado dip.\n\nDOCTORS PERFORMING KIDNEY TRANSPLANT ON GIRL, 9, DISCOVER SHOCKING ABNORMALITY IN DONATED ORGAN\n\nBut in a newly reported peculiarity, New York physicians recalled when a 70-year-old woman came to them with a purple, spiderweb-like rash all over her body. The woman\u2019s case was published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).\n\nDr. Konika Sharma and Dr. Anush Patel with the Bassett Medical Center in Cooperstown, N.Y., treated the woman, who arrived at their clinic complaining of dizziness and rashes. Two weeks prior, she suffered a viral respiratory tract infection, they wrote.\n\nThe doctors noted the woman\u2019s rash was \u201cconsistent with livedo reticularis\u201d \u2014 a condition that causes skin, typically on the legs, to look blotchy and purple. The Mayo Clinic states livedo reticularis occurs \u201cdue to spasms of the blood vessels or an abnormality of the circulation near the skin surface.\u201d Cold weather can trigger the condition; Sharma and Patel noted that temperatures were below freezing when the woman sought their help.\n\nAfter drawing her blood, doctors noticed it clumped (scientifically referred to as agglutination) inside of the vial, a sign of a blood disorder known as cold agglutinin disease. The Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center defines the condition as a \u201crare type of autoimmune hemolytic anemia in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys its own red blood cells.\"\n\nDoctors warmed the blood in a saline bath, and it returned to a normal texture. They subsequently diagnosed the woman with cold agglutinin disease, which can occur for unknown reasons but is sometimes associated with other conditions, such as certain bacterial and viral infections, or certain cancers and autoimmune diseases.\n\nAs for the woman, her case of cold agglutinin disease \u201cmay have been exacerbated by [the] recent viral infection along with the cold weather in upstate New York, where the temperature was 15 degrees F (\u22129 degrees C) at the time of her presentation,\u201d they wrote.\n\nMAN\u2019S FOOT SEVERED IN HORRIFIC MOTORCYCLE CRASH REATTACHED DURING 7-HOUR SURGERY\n\nThe woman was then treated with blood transfusions and rituximab \u2014 a type of medication \u2014 for a week. She improved, telling the doctors she felt less dizzy, which itself is also a symptom of cold agglutinin disease. But, they noted, \u201cthe rash persisted.\u201d\n\nDr. Konika Sharma did not immediately return Fox News\u2019 request for additional comment on Thursday.", "description": "A New York woman arrived at a medical clinic with spidery, purple rash all over body.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
