They will also be parsing third-quarter earnings reports in the coming weeks to see what big companies have to say about the effects of the trade war on their businesses.\n\n\"We could see a continued deterioration in manufacturing,\" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. \"We could move lower from here. And that, to me, is the reality of continuing with the trade wars. It will impact the U.S.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 343.79 points, or 1.3%, to 26573.04, while the S&P 500 fell 36.49 points, or 1.2%, to 2940.25. The declines were broad with 26 of 30 blue-chip stocks and all 11 S&P 500 sectors in the red. The industrial, materials and energy segments dropped more than 2%.\n\nThe losses wiped out both indexes' gains for the third quarter, though the Dow industrials are still up 14% for the year and the S&P is holding on to a 17% increase.\n\nThe technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 90.65 points, or 1.1%, to 7908.68.\n\nThe indexes opened higher but reversed course after the Institute for Supply Management said its U.S. manufacturing index fell to 47.8 in September -- the lowest since June 2009 -- from 49.1 in August. Readings below 50 indicate a contraction in manufacturing activity.\n\n\"Everything now seems to be orbiting around the manufacturing data, which unfortunately reinforced data we had coming out of Europe last week, specifically Germany, kind of pointing to this global slowdown scenario, at least from the manufacturing,\" said Daniel Morgan, vice president and senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust.\n\nInvestors flocked to the safety of U.S. government bonds and gold following the release of the data. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.651%, from above 1.7% earlier in the session. Bond yields fall when prices rise. Gold prices flipped higher, climbing 1.1%\n\nSlowing economic growth has prompted central banks, including the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, to enact stimulus measures, and federal funds futures showed traders priced in a higher probability of more interest-rate cuts this year following Tuesday's data release.\n\nInvestors will be closely watching Friday's employment report for September to see whether August's hiring slowdown was an anomaly.\n\nAmong Tuesday's big stock movers, online brokers slumped after Charles Schwab said it would eliminate commissions on online stock trades, furthering the e-broker price wars. Shares of Charles Schwab fell nearly 10%, while TD Ameritrade Holding plunged 26%--its largest percent decrease since 1999, according to Dow Jones Market Data -- and E*Trade Financial sank 16%.\n\nElsewhere, European stocks edged lower, as manufacturing sentiment in the continent fell to the lowest level in nearly seven years.\n\nAdding to the subdued outlook, the eurozone's annual rate of inflation fell to 0.9% in September, its lowest level in almost three years, data published Tuesday showed. The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 1.3%.\n\nEarlier in the day, Australia's benchmark index rose 0.8% after the Australian central bank cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to a record low 0.75% and left the door open to more cuts.\n\nWrite to Max Bernhard at Max.Bernhard@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 01, 2019 17:03 ET (21:03 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
