Buy Now Because the Bad News Is Priced In, One Analyst Says", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nStifel believes Netflix \u2019s stock plunge since July means investors are already discounting bad future results, which bodes well for the shares.\n\nThe back story. The year-to-date return on Netflix stock (ticker: NFLX) is now a negative 1%. That is a stunning drop given that the company\u2019s shares were up as much as 44% for 2019 in early May.\n\nThe stock has also fallen about 27% since the company\u2019s big second-quarter subscriber miss on July 17. The streaming giant added 2.8 million net new international subscribers but lost 126,000 U.S. customers in the quarter that ended in June. Wall Street had expected 352,000 domestic and 4.8 million international adds.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nInvestors are also wondering about increasing competition. Netflix\u2019s chief executive seemed to validate this concern on Friday, referencing forthcoming streaming services from Disney (DIS) and Apple (AAPL).\n\nIn July, Barron\u2019s suggested that Netflix\u2019s problems may have only just begun, citing increasing competition and third-party content departures.\n\nWhat\u2019s new. Stifel analyst Scott Devitt reiterated his Buy rating for Netflix stock on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe think the stock is now pricing in potentially light net adds for 3Q and a light 4Q guide and sentiment has turned decidedly bearish on what we believe may be transient factors that impacted last quarter,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are constructive on the current risk/reward set up.\u201d\n\nNetflix shares were down 0.5% to $263.40 shortly after the market opened on Thursday. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 0.2%.\n\nThe analyst is optimistic because of the size of the company\u2019s content library. He noted how Netflix is expected to offer nearly 1,000 original TV series by year-end. He also predicts that the company will be able to raise its prices over the long term.\n\nLooking ahead. Devitt reiterated his $400 price target for Netflix shares.\n\nWrite to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.com", "description": "Stifel analyst Scott Devitt reiterated his Buy rating for Netflix stock on Thursday.
