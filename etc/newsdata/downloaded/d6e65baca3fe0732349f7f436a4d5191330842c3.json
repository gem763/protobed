I like Alberto, he\u2019s a cool guy... I\u2019m just really happy to win the race and get a gold medal out of today.\u201d\n\nBrazier was left out of the U.S. team for the Rio de Janeiro Olympics as a 19-year-old and then eliminated in the semi-finals at the world championships in London two years ago. Last year, he was hampered by injury but this season he has found his form.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said all season that my goal was to get the gold here and to break this record, and that\u2019s what I did,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means the world to me. To be world champion at 22 years old, I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nThe race was left wide open after Botswana\u2019s Nijel Amos, one of the favorites, withdrew before his opening heat on Saturday with an Achilles injury and titleholder Pierre-Ambroise Bosse was eliminated in the semi-finals.\n\nVazquez quickly took the initiative and led at the bell with Brazier tucked in behind and Tuka in third.\n\nThere was never any doubt above the outcome when Brazier made his move down the back straight while Vazquez was also overhauled by Tuka and Rotich on the final bend.", "description": "Donavan Brazier stormed home and broke the world championship record to claim a first-ever world title for the United States in the men's 800 meters on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Brian Homewood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435995119&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF903CK-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
