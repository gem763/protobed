Well, she didn't kill her...'\n\nHis upbeat demeanor was a far cry from the 911 call her made following the shooting last Thursday.\n\nSpringer was a passenger in the vehicle, and the bodycam footage - released on Tuesday - shows her sliding out of the truck's right-hand door as she holds her left thigh\n\nThe seven-month old pup, named Molly, belongs to Brent Parks, 79, who was driving the pick-up truck at the time of the shooting\n\nIn audio from the 911 call, Parks tells the dispatcher everything that happened.\n\n'Well a gun went off. Got her in the leg. She didn't do it herself. I had a dog in here and he stepped on the gun,' Parks says.\n\n'The dog shot her?' the dispatcher asked. Parks answered: 'Yes, she stepped on it and it went off. But anyway, can you get an ambulance out here.'\n\nMeanwhile, Springer is heard in the background saying, 'I don't feel good' and 'tell my kids I love them'.\n\n'She's bleeding pretty bad,' Parks is heard saying.\n\n'She's alert but she's losing blood bad. I'm trying to find something to wrap around her leg but she's a screaming and all this sh*t,' a frustrated Parks is heard saying.\n\nThe dispatcher then asks Parks if he has a clean dry cloth. 'If I had a clean dry cloth it would've already been on her ma'am,' Parks retorts.\n\nHe then says he can use his belt and the dispatcher instructs him to make a tourniquet with the belt.\n\nPolice later determined that the cloth from the seat covers may have gotten into the trigger well of the gun, making it discharge.\n\nOfficers say Parks told them the gun isn't usually loaded.", "description": "The dramatic incident occurred in Enid, northern Oklahoma last Thursday after the\u00a0startled pooch jumped onto the center console and set of the loaded weapon.", "authors": ["Andrew Court", "Valerie Edwards For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/19/19455504-0-image-a-38_1570559772145.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
