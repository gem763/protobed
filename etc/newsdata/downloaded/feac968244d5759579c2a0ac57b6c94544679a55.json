During that debate, Joe Biden made a similar claim about his plan\u2014that the uninsured would be enrolled through an \u201cautomatic buy-in.\u201d\n\n\n\nBiden\u2019s plan is actually more specific than Buttigieg\u2019s in this regard\u2014it would automatically enroll people at less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level \u201cwhen they interact with certain institutions (such as public schools) or other programs for low-income populations (such as SNAP).\u201d If you are really committed to not providing universal health care, this is a decent way to get many people who should be covered enrolled.\n\n\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro heaped criticism on Biden for proposing that people should have to buy into the plan, and was, in turn, castigated by the media for this slightly flawed interpretation of Joe Biden\u2019s verbal minestrone. But complaints about Castro\u2019s lack of civility don\u2019t alter the fact that an \u201cautomatic buy-in\u201d doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. Similarly, Buttigieg can promise that there will be automatic enrollment, but you have to explain how that will happen. No social welfare program or benefit in America happens automatically, including Medicaid. We don\u2019t even get our taxes calculated automatically by the government, which many other countries do without falling into the ocean.\n\n\n\nSo, how is Pete Buttigieg going to complete the heretofore unachieved task of automatically enrolling eligible people for government benefits? Is the government going to use annual tax filings to determine your income\u2014which will be accompanied by insanely long delays in the so-called \u201cautomatic\u201d enrollment? If we have automatic enrollment for these people based on their income, why not implement automatic Medicaid enrollment, too? What happens for people whose incomes fluctuate a lot, and who might drift in and out of eligibility for a free plan?\n\n\n\nWhat about the rest of America, the ones who aren\u2019t eligible for either Medicaid or a free public option? The way Buttigieg envisions it, people on the Affordable Care Act exchanges would see increased subsidies, linked to gold-level coverage instead of silver. (Even Gold plans only cover about 80 percent of costs.) One example given: a \u201c60-year-old in Iowa making $50,000 and currently paying $12,000 annually in premiums will now pay no more than $4,250 annually for gold coverage.\u201d Yes, it is true that $12,000 annually in premiums is an unconscionable disgrace. But so is $4,250, which works out to $354 a month.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, this is something that\u2019s meant to excite people. This is what Buttigieg believes will inspire Democratic voters to Pok\u00e9mon Go to the polls. By contrast, Bernie Sanders\u2019s Senate office estimates that under his Medicare for All bill, \u201ca typical family of four earning $50,000, after taking the standard deduction, would pay a 4 percent income-based premium to fund Medicare for All\u2014just $844 a year\u2014saving that family over $4,400 a year.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnly 11 million people are on the ACA exchanges; what about the rest? Buttigieg says that anyone would \u201cbe able to opt in to an affordable, comprehensive public alternative,\u201d which will \u201cincentivize private insurers to compete on price and bring down costs.\u201d He further proposes to \u201cprohibit health care providers from pricing irresponsibly by capping their out-of-network rates at twice what Medicare pays,\u201d thus lowering health insurance premiums. He would also strengthen requirements that nonprofit hospitals document their \u201ccommunity benefit,\u201d which often includes free care for the uninsured, in order to maintain their tax-exempt status; currently, non-profit hospitals game that system.\n\n\n\nNone of this is what Elizabeth Warren would call \u201cbig structural change.\u201d It is squarely in the territory of fiddling at the margins. But according to Buttigieg, and others who propose similar plans, this kind of market-based tinkering will make a public option so cheap and so good that the insurance industry will simply collapse, creating a \u201cglide path\u201d to Medicare for All. Picking a metaphor that makes it sound like a smooth, natural transition is clever but dishonest; do you imagine the insurance industry making this an easy ride instead of, say, hijacking the plane with a gun? Buttigieg\u2019s plan falls prey to the same mistake that all of the non-single-payer plans make: the belief that significant conflict with the various bad actors in the health care system can be avoided.\n\n\n\nThere is a reason American health spending is so much higher than other countries, and it\u2019s not that America is Great, or that our health care is just that much better\u2014on the whole, it\u2019s worse. The cost of health care is high because the United States is the only country that includes\u2014indeed, prizes\u2014such a huge and profitable role for private actors in the health care industry. In order to ensure that everyone has good health care, a lot of these bad actors are going to have to make less money. Hospitals are going to have to make less money. Drug companies, too, are going to have to make less money\u2014don\u2019t fret, Pfizer had a profit of $5 billion just last quarter, enough to stash away for a rainy day. And the insurance industry, which provides nothing to the practice of health care itself but a middleman with an outstretched hand, must simply be turned into a shell of its former self; its billions and billions in profits, made on our backs, cannot be sustained.\n\nThe industries in question will not accept this. If we are going to have Medicare for All, it is going to be won through a long and bloody battle. Big, profitable, bloodthirsty companies have not historically been taken down by a bright-eyed Harvard Man with a Really Good Plan. They certainly won\u2019t be taken down by one with a really bad plan.", "description": "Short on details and long on na\u00efvete, the South Bend mayor aims to leave the status quo unruffled.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/cbba28ad0c6e30cac4150f55618cb91a6b2a2c55.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
