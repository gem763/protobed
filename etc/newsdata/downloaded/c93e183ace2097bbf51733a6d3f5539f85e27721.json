I think internally, we have to be different and be realistic and we haven't changed our tone on that at all.\n\nGareth Southgate has warned his England side they need to stop dreaming of Euro 2020 glory\n\nThe Three Lions suffered a hugely disappointing 2-1 defeat at the Czech Republic on Friday\n\n'We know our strengths and we know the areas we have to improve upon. We've talked about it throughout the week and we've had evidence of it tonight. So, I don't think any of us within the camp are under any illusions. To be a really top team, with players with experience of winning the biggest matches, we're still some way from that.'\n\nIt means Southgate and his assistant Steve Holland are planning to work on further tactical changes having switched from 3-5-3 to 4-3-3 last year. The team looked wide open trying to play 4-2-3-1 in the first half against the Czech Republic and now Southgate is contemplating whether they need to return to a back three to improve defensive solidity.\n\n'I think players take in tactical concepts very quickly, especially top players,' he said. 'So, we have to keep reflecting on what's working, what's possible and learn from every experience we have. We've had straightforward qualifying games that haven't challenged us.\n\n'Tonight [against Czech Republic] was a proper test and we didn't come through, so it would be naive not to take the lessons from what we've seen on the pitch tonight.'", "description": "With both the semis and finals scheduled to be at Wembley, England have an opportunity to replicate the 1966 World Cup win, yet the team seem far off that standard.", "authors": ["Rob Draper For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/21/19635766-0-image-a-40_1570912477427.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
