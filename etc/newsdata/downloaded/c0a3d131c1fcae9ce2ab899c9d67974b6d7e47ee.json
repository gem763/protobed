Some say they don't like British Airways' cost-cutting drive and they want to see more of the benefits of their bumper profits.\n\nBut industry insiders say BA has made those profits because they have cut costs. And that airlines are expensive and unpredictable beasts to run, in thrall to a fluctuating oil price (jet fuel accounts for a quarter of their operating costs) and random acts such as drones in the air.\n\nIf they don't come to an agreement in the next few weeks, another strike is scheduled for 27 September. The result of the pilots' union ballot allows strike action until the start of next year, but Balpa says it hopes to resolve the situation well before then.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nPilots previously rejected a pay increase worth 11.5% over three years, which was proposed by the airline in July.\n\nBalpa says that its members have taken lower pay rises and made sacrifices during more stringent times for the airline in recent years. The union insists that now that BA's financial performance has improved - its parent company IAG reported a 9% rise in profits last year - they should see a greater share of the profits.\n\nBA says its pilots already receive \"world-class\" salaries. The airline believes the pay offer is \"fair and generous\", and that if it is good enough for BA cabin crew, ground staff and engineers - whose unions, Unite and the GMB, have both accepted it - it should be good enough for pilots, too.\n\nThe airline says once the 11.5% pay deal has fully taken effect in three years' time, some BA captains could be taking home more than \u00a3200,000 a year, allowances included.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nTwo weeks ago, BA informed some customers they would have to re-book their flights next week due to the planned industrial action.\n\nUnfortunately, due to \"human error\" the airline mistakenly sent emails to some customers whose flights were not actually affected, throwing BA's customer service operations into a tailspin over the bank holiday weekend.\n\nOn Friday, BA said the \"vast majority\" of affected customers had now either accepted a refund or rebooked, either on alternative dates or with other airlines.\n\nWhat rights do passengers have if their flight is affected?\n\nBA advice says you can request a full refund, rebook your flight for another time in the next 355 days, or use the value of your fare to fly to a different destination.\n\nIf your flight has been cancelled due to a strike, the Civil Aviation Authority says passengers also have a legal right to a replacement flight at BA's expense to get you to your destination, even if this means travelling with a different airline.\n\nMost affected passengers would already have been in contact with BA, but they may not have considered additional costs, such as airport parking. They are advised to keep receipts for these extra costs, and BA said it would look at refunding them on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe cost of separate hotel or accommodation bookings that cannot be used may need to be claimed from travel insurance.\n\nAre you affected by the BA strikes?
