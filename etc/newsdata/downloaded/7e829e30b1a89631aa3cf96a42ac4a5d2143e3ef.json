Over 200,000 people in both provinces were left without electricity for days.\n\nThough no one was killed in the storms, the destruction was widespread, with several homes in Dunrobin levelled to their foundations. In the Arlington Woods neighbourhood of Ottawa, a forest of towering white pine trees was nearly wiped out.\n\nCommunities on both sides of the Ottawa River are still working to recover from the storms, with many families still not back in their homes.\n\nOn the first anniversary of the event, CBC Ottawa created this interactive video, showing scenes from the days after the storm.\n\nHow to use this video\n\nClick on a region to see what the area looked like and hear interviews with residents working to rebuild.\n\nTo navigate back to the home screen, use the controls at the bottom of the video.
