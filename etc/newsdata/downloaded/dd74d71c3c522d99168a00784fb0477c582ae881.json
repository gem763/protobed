They have begun the process of looking at potential suitors, and the #Browns have been one. Unclear how high they set the asking price, but they'll at least listen. \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) October 28, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWhat would the Redskins want in return for Williams? NBC Sports Washington's JP Finlay notes draft picks aren't the only asset Washington could pursue in a potential trade:\n\nCould the Redskins trade Trent Williams? Definitely. But the price is high and sources tell me the team might want a playmaker in return, not just about draft picks. Trying to give Haskins weapons. \u2014 JP Finlay (@JPFinlayNBCS) October 28, 2019\n\nSports Illustrated's Albert Breer reports the Redskins' current asking price for Williams is a first-round draft pick.\n\nStory continues\n\nWilliams, who has held out all season, would not be a rental for any team that acquires him. His contract expires after the 2020 season, and he still should have prime years left at 31 years old. The Redskins have a 1-7 record entering Week 9 and absolutely should trade Williams to acquire valuable draft picks and/or young players to help accelerate their rebuild. Then again, this Redskins front office has a long history of questionable roster decisions.\n\nShould the New England Patriots be interested in Williams? He certainly would be a huge upgrade on the left side of their offensive line. Second-year left tackle Isaiah Wynn has been on injured reserve since September and could return later in the season, but his injury history remains a concern. Bringing Williams into the fold would help solidify a position that's essential to protecting Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
