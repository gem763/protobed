The USTR released a list Wednesday of products it plans to target, intensifying the Trump administration's global trade battles. The duties would take effect Oct. 18. The duties include: 10% tariffs on aircraft from France, Germany, Spain or the United Kingdom\n\n25% duties on single-malt Irish and Scotch whiskies, various garments and blankets from the U.K.\n\n25% tariffs on coffee and certain tools and machinery from Germany\n\n25% duties on various cheeses, olive oil and frozen meat from Germany, Spain and the U.K.\n\n25% tariffs on certain pork products, butter and yogurt from multiple countries\n\nEarlier, the WTO gave the Trump administration the right to put tariffs on $7.5 billion in European goods. The U.S. had lodged complaints, first in 2004, over what it called illegal subsidies for aircraft maker Airbus by several European governments. U.S. officials contend the EU has \"no basis\" to retaliate against the planned duties. The USTR said it asked the WTO to schedule an Oct. 14 meeting to approve a U.S. request to take the countermeasures against the EU. It was not immediately clear if the value of the products on the USTR list was $7.5 billion or less than that. The action escalates conflicts the Trump administration has waged around the globe as it tries to get major trade partners to change their practices. The U.S. is locked in a trade war with China as it struggles to strike a new agreement with the world's second-largest economy. The news of a widening trade conflict follows a day of trading when major U.S. stock indexes each fell more than 1.5% amid fears of a slowing economy. Investors have worried about sustained trade wars dragging on global growth and potentially pulling the U.S. into a recession.\n\nEric Cabanis | AFP | Getty Images", "description": "The U.S. plans to add a 10% tariff on EU aircraft and a 25% duty on agricultural and other products, according to officials.", "authors": ["Jacob Pramuk Kayla Tausche", "Jacob Pramuk", "Kayla Tausche"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/101090593-Airbus A350.jpg?v=1570047186"}
