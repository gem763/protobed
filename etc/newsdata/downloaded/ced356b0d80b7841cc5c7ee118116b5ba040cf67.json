Trump team, drawn deep into Ukraine scandal", "language": "en", "text": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Less than a month ago, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo triumphed over rivals to emerge as the dominant force in Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nPompeo\u2019s ascendancy was confirmed in a very public manner when Trump sacked his chief adversary, John Bolton, as national security advisor on September 10.\n\nBut Pompeo\u2019s fortunes have suddenly darkened over his role in the Ukraine scandal that has triggered an impeachment probe into the president.\n\nAfter prevaricating for days, Pompeo finally confirmed he was on the now-famous telephone call when Trump pressed Ukraine for damaging information on Joe Biden \u2014 whom Trump may face in the 2020 election.\n\nPompeo had previously dodged questions about the call in an interview with ABC News on September 22, suggesting he knew nothing about the conversation.\n\nLast week he said he had only read \u201cthe first couple of paragraphs\u201d of a whistleblower\u2019s complaint about the July 25 call \u2014 before on Wednesday curtly confirming press reports that he had been on the call.\n\nPompeo\u2019s Democratic critics say he is now a \u201cwitness\u201d caught in a conflict of interest that should rule him out of decisions on how the State Department deals with the investigation.\n\nHe has been accused of \u201cstonewalling\u201d the investigation and trying to limit what his staff could discuss if they testify.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Destruction of US diplomacy\u2019 \u2013\n\nPompeo himself has been subpoenaed by the Congressional committees carrying out the impeachment investigation for documents relating to the Ukraine scandal, putting him in the firing line of the political row that threatens to engulf Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has said he gave a dossier of Ukraine documents directly to Pompeo in March.\n\nAccording to the House committees investigating possible impeachment, the dossier was \u201ca package of disinformation, debunked conspiracy theories, and baseless allegations.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post this week accused Pompeo of \u201cenabling the destruction of US diplomacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Pompeo did nothing to stop Mr. Giuliani from allying himself with some of Ukraine\u2019s most corrupt figures to peddle false stories about Mr. Biden, as well as conspiracy theories about Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 presidential election,\u201d it said in an editorial.\n\nOne potential threat to Pompeo \u2014 and his boss \u2014 could be the evidence of former US special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, who resigned last week.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint depicts Volker as speaking with Giuliani to \u201ccontain the damage\u201d of the lawyer\u2019s meddling in Ukraine affairs.\n\nA day after the July 25 call, Volker met with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and other senior Ukraine officials and advised them how to \u201cnavigate\u201d Trump\u2019s demands.\n\nPompeo, a former soldier, lawyer and businessman, has so far taken a characteristically defiant stance \u2014 sticking loyally by the president and dismissing his critics with contempt.\n\nWhen the House committee chairs asked for five diplomats to testify, Pompeo blasted the request as \u201can attempt to intimidate, bully, and treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State.\u201d\n\nSetting the scene for a campaign to prevent or delay any impeachment proceedings, Pompeo has accused the lawmakers of \u201cserious substantive and procedural deficiencies\u201d in their request for testimonies.\n\n\u2013 Trump\u2019s close ally \u2013\n\nPompeo, so close to Trump that the president last year said he was the only advisor with whom he has never argued, has risen quickly in Washington since arriving as a Kansas congressman elected in the 2010 right-wing populist \u201cTea Party\u201d movement.\n\nMany speculate he could be enticed by an opening to represent Kansas in the Senate next year \u2014 perhaps with an eye on running for the top prize in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIronically, the impeachment fight echoes how Pompeo came to prominence pursuing Hillary Clinton and the State Department in the inquiry into the deadly 2012 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi.\n\nAt the time he said \u201cthe White House in particular left large holes in the investigation by denying the Committee access to documents and witnesses.\u201d\n\nHis critics now hope to hold his words against him.",
