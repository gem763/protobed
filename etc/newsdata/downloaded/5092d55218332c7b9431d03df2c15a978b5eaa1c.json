Ironically, their actions were causing more carbon emissions while antagonizing commuters.\n\nA gentleman in scrubs did not take kindly to them preventing him from getting to work. He let them know by ripping their banner out of their hands and tossing it over a fence.\n\nBut now In-N-Out Burger has their own entry of having to deal with the climate crazy gang.\n\nAs you may know, the owner and heiress of the burger chain, Lynsi Snyder, isn\u2019t shy about saying that her business is influenced by her Christian beliefs, even putting bible verses like John 3:16 on the bottom of the cups.\n\nBut they\u2019re also know for their tasty burgers and great service, with a big focus on customer satisfaction.\n\nThat\u2019s why they\u2019ve become pretty darn successful, with revenue that should surpass $1 billion this year, according to my colleague Mike Ford. Plus they had an early policy of not opening stores unless they were able to do so debt-free, an idea they still try to get close to, a pretty phenomenal approach. How many businesses can say that?\n\nBut that didn\u2019t prevent folks, allegedly from Extinction Rebellion, from targeting their restaurant on the Pacific Coast Highway in Long Beach, California.\n\nWhy protesters were targeting the restaurant is not entirely clear, although climate change folks have made meat one of their targets.\n\nBut the employees with that great customer service ethic were having none of that.\n\nAnd they ushered the protesters out, even picking one up and bodily carrying him outside. Very politely.\n\nThat man was none too pleased as he screamed at the employees through a bullhorn.\n\nClimate change activists raid a burger joint and harass the workers. Neither the employees nor police are having it. People are fed up with Extinction Rebellion. pic.twitter.com/6bIPK4pb9U \u2014 Ian Miles Cheong (@stillgray) October 18, 2019\n\nWhen the police showed up, that\u2019s when it really didn\u2019t go well for the protesters.\n\nThe police were not receptive to their claims and they arrested at least one woman, as the male protesters screamed at them too. The men argued that their female companion was the one who had been assaulted, then accused the police of illegally arresting her and \u201ccruel and unusual punishment.\u201d\n\nThinking that\u2019s the last time the group will try that at an In-N-Out Burger.\n\nAnd people loved it.\n\nIn and Out Burger, you are my next destination for lunch tomorrow. It's about time someone booted these ne'er do wells out of their establishment. \u2014 David At Large (@David_At_Large) October 18, 2019\n\nI didn\u2019t know it was possible to love in n out more than I already do \u2014 Loren (@LorenSethC) October 19, 2019", "description": "If You Didn\u2019t Already Love In-N-Out Burger, Check How They Responded When the Climate Change Gang Showed Up", "authors": ["Nick Arama", "Brandon Morse", "Elizabeth Vaughn", "Kira Davis", "Alex Parker", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/93dea44a-a714-4299-a81d-7f4a44f0f3ca@news.ap_.org_.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
