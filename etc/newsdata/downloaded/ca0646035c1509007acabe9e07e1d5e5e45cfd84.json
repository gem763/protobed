The illnesses have been reported in 25 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration said in a statement Friday.\n\nIn many cases, patients reported having difficulty breathing, shortness of breath and/or chest pain before hospitalization, the joint statement released by CDC Director Robert Redfield and acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless noted. More information, however, is needed to understand if there is a direct correlation between vaping products or substances and the reported illnesses, the statement said.\n\n\u201cEven though cases appear similar, it is not clear if these cases have a common cause or if they are different diseases with similar presentations, which is why our ongoing investigation is critical,\u201d Redfield and Sharpless said in the release.\n\nThe CDC issued a health advisory Friday to alert health officials to the growing number of severe lung disease cases. The CDC and FDA urged people who vape not to purchase products off the street, and seek medical help immediately if they have any symptoms, like trouble breathing or chest pain. The news comes a week after the first vaping-related death in the U.S. when a patient from Illinois died from a fatal lung disease associated with e-cigarette products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCounterfit e-cigarettes have been blamed for potentially causing a spike in lung damage among teens.
