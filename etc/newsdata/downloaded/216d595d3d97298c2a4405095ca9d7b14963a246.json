"title": "Teacher cleared of sex crimes in the UK is jailed for 11 years in Spain for affair with a pupil", "language": "en", "text": "A British teacher cleared of sex crimes in the UK has been jailed for eleven and a half years over an affair with a teenage pupil at his new job in southern Spain.\n\nCarlo Troiano, 42, moved to Spain after his acquittal at a 2010 trial over charges of engaging in sexual activity with a 16-year-old pupil at a school in Cheshire.\n\nThis month, the father-of-two from Wirral, was convicted and sentenced to jail for the 'continued sexual abuse' of a 15-year-old student at St George's British School of Almeria - his new school in southern Spain.\n\nAt Troiano's two-day trial, that started on October 1 at Almeria's Provincial Court, his victim described how her former teacher had seduced her by favouring her in class, liking her Instagram photos and persuading her to get a tattoo done.\n\nThe former British teacher cleared of sex crimes in the UK in 2010 has now been jailed over a sexual affair with one of his new pupils at a school in the south of Spain\n\nThe teenager said she was in her school uniform when Troiano offered her alcohol, before kissing her for the first time in April 2016.\n\nShe also told the three trial judges that, when she told the 42-year-old he was 'wasting his time', he had pressured her into continuing to see him by insisting he would quit his job and leave her class without a teacher.\n\nShe described finding a video Troiano had of the two of them having sex, which had been taken without her consent, on his email.\n\nShe also revealed that her former teacher never used a condom when they had sex, but would give her a morning-after pill that he bought at his local chemist.\n\nIn a 29-page ruling released today, after two weeks of deliberation, the three judges described her testimony as 'credible'.\n\nThey said Troiano's court claim that they did not have sex till she was 16 'did not deserve credit', ruling that it was 'improbable' they had a platonic relationship as he insisted.\n\nThey said the text messages the pair exchanged showed Troiano acted with a 'seductive purpose.'\n\nIn one of the text messages revealed in the document the 42-year-old told the teenager: 'You are like my own Barbie in real life, I would love to dress and undress you, you looked fantastic in those shorts today after school, you make me really hard.'\n\nIn a court document texts sent to the teenager girl showed how the teacher had attempted to seduce his pupil\n\nIn the ruling the judges said that in the 2015/2016 academic year Troiano 'guided by a libidinous desire' took advantage of his position and began a 'supposedly friendly relationship' with the teenage girl when she was just 14 that led to continuous sexual abuse.\n\nThe three trial judges ruled over a period of six-months from May 2016 the teacher took advantage of his position to sexually abuse the schoolgirl.\n\n'He gave her preferential treatment and gradually managed to establish a more personal and intimate relationship with her,' the judges wrote in the court judgement.\n\n'In April 2016 he received her in his home where he kissed her on the mouth after insisting and winning over her initial resistance.\n\n'The relationship became more intense from about May 2016 and the accused had sex several times with the minor at his home.'\n\nThe abuse ended when the girl's mother uncovered what was happening and reported Troiano to the police, who was subsequently dismissed from his teaching position and arrested.\n\nHe was held on remand in prison for nearly a year and was briefly released on bail in December 2017.\n\nHowever, after he travelled abroad in a failed attempt to get his victim to drop charges against him, he was extradited from Germany to Spain and once again put behind bars until his trial this month.\n\nThe Spanish judges were also critical of the school in Spain for failing to do more to protect students after news of Troiano's former acquittal was uncovered\n\nIn the court document the judges also slammed the school in Spain, now called simply the British School of Almeria, in the holiday resort of Roquetas de Mar.\n\nIt criticised headteacher Neil Morris for failing to sack the 42-year-old, or impose any measures to minimise the risk to the school's pupils, after uncovering details of the previous court case on Google.\n\nIn January 2010 Troiano, who is now divorced, was found not guilty of three charges of causing or enticing sexual activity with a 16-year-old pupil in his classroom at Bankfield High School.\n\nA jury of seven women and five men ruled they did not believe the 17-year-old had been telling the truth and unanimously cleared him of all charges after a four-day trial at Warrington Crown Court.\n\nDespite his acquittal, a subsequent internal investigation saw the school governors dismiss Troiano.\n\nHe subsequently moved to Spain, where he found a new job at the prestigious private school in Almeria and continued teaching until his arrest in 2016.\n\nLead judge Luis Miguel Columna, in a damning indictment of Troiano's new school, said in the court ruling: 'The school chiefs discovered months after they took him on that he had been tried for sex abuse in the UK and acquitted.\n\n'It was also informed that two teachers had seen the accused and the minor together outside of school hours, in a supermarket and on the beach.\n\n'Despite that it didn't adopt any special measure until the child's mother reported him, which was the moment when they sacked him.'\n\nAs well as being jailed for eleven and a half years, the disgraced former teacher was banned from the classroom for the same time period and ordered to pay his victim \u00a343,180.\n\nBritish Education System SL, the Spanish firm running Troiano's old school, was ordered to pay the fine if he failed to do so.", "description": "Carlo Troiano, 42,
