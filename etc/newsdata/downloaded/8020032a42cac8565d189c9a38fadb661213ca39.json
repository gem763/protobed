Bernie Sanders\u2019s admission late Friday that he had suffered a heart attack three days earlier invited new scrutiny of the presidential candidate\u2019s age, health and ability to keep up with the rigors of a national campaign.\n\nSanders released a video hours after he was discharged from a Las Vegas hospital, thanking well-wishers for their support and promising to return \u201csoon\u201d to the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling so much better,\u201d Sanders said, his arm draped around his wife, Jane.\n\nBut neither Sanders (I-Vt.) nor his campaign offered details about how serious his condition was, leaving open the question of how soon he would reemerge and whether voters would lose confidence in his ability to serve as president.\n\nThe episode also brought new attention to a Democratic field that is dominated by three septuagenarians: Sanders, 78; former vice president Joe Biden, 76; and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), 70 \u2014 each of whom would be the oldest president ever to take office.\n\n\u201cI think anybody\u2019s health is of concern when it comes to that high office,\u201d said Jeremy Dumkrieger, chairman of the Woodbury County, Iowa, Democratic Party, who supported Sanders in 2016 but is neutral so far this year. \u201cYou know, if the person was 40 and was having some issues, I\u2019d have concerns about it, too.\u201d\n\n[Impeachment furor throws the Democratic campaign into uncertain territory]\n\nSanders headed home Saturday to Burlington, Vt., with no word on how long he would stay there. Jane Sanders said before his release that he would rest a \u201cfew days\u201d but would take part in the Oct. 15 Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s decision to wait three days to reveal that Sanders had suffered a heart attack conjured images of Hillary Clinton\u2019s collapse in 2016 at a memorial service for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Clinton, at the time the Democratic presidential nominee, had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlier, but her campaign did not reveal that fact until many hours after she had fainted.\n\nSanders aides revealed Wednesday that he had experienced chest pains at a campaign event Tuesday and had undergone a stent procedure to clear an artery blockage.\n\nAfter he left the hospital Friday, his campaign released a statement from his doctors saying Sanders was diagnosed with a myocardial infarction \u2014 a heart attack. \u201cHis hospital course was uneventful with good expected progress. He was discharged with instructions to follow up with his personal physician,\u201d said his treating physicians, Arturo E. Marchand Jr. and Arjun Gururaj.\n\nBut Sanders\u2019s campaign declined to offer much detail about how serious his heart attack was. On Saturday, the campaign declined a request to speak directly with his doctors about his condition.\n\nAsked Friday why they waited to announce the diagnosis, Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca said, \u201cWe just wanted to wait until he was discharged to give out the information all at once.\u201d\n\n[Sanders raised $25.3 million in third quarter, campaign says]\n\nA heart attack occurs when a portion of the heart muscle is permanently damaged from a lack of blood flow, said Quinn Capers IV, an interventional cardiologist and professor of internal medicine at Ohio State University. In an interview Saturday, Capers said, \u201cThe most important thing that dictates how well somebody will do after a heart attack is how much of the heart muscle was permanently damaged.\u201d\n\nCapers said the length of Sanders\u2019s hospital stay suggests a small or moderate heart attack, after which patients can live long and healthy lives \u2014 though he cautioned that he could not know for sure because he did not treat the candidate.\n\nAge can also be a factor in recovery, Capers said.\n\nHealth issues have dogged presidential candidates in a number of past elections. After Clinton\u2019s fainting episode, detractors spread unsubstantiated claims of underlying illness.\n\nIn 1999, just weeks before the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, then-Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley underwent treatment for an irregular heartbeat, prompting headlines such as \u201cBradley\u2019s heart ailment injects health as campaign issue.\u201d Although he\u2019d managed the condition for four years and experts described it as \u201cmore nuisance than danger,\u201d his campaign never gained traction against the eventual nominee, Al Gore.\n\nThe Sanders campaign has sought to project a business-as-usual attitude as the senator takes time away from his hectic schedule. A trio of top surrogates fanned out to campaign in Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire over the weekend. And a $1.3 million TV ad buy the campaign had put off will start Tuesday in Iowa.\n\nCampaign aides have said unequivocally that Sanders will attend the Oct. 15 debate, but his campaign schedule shows no other events before then.\n\nCapers said that if Sanders were his patient, he would probably recommend seven to eight hours of sleep a night, healthy meals and time for stress release. Getting back for the debate \u201cseems like a challenge,\u201d Capers said, adding that if a patient told him he had to be there, he would recommend no additional activity before then.\n\nSanders aides have pointed to his strong fundraising as a sign of enthusiasm for his candidacy, even as he sits in third place in many polls behind Biden and Warren. Sanders raised $25.3 million in the third quarter of the year, an impressive sum that topped all his Democratic rivals. His campaign said late Friday that it has $33.7 million in his account, a sizable war chest that could sustain campaign operations for months.\n\nIt was unclear how news of Sanders\u2019s heart attack would affect his fundraising and his future campaign strategy. Before his heart attack, Sanders campaigned more aggressively than most, if not all, of his rivals. He often held multiple events per day, sometimes in more than one state.\n\nWhether the heart attack would shift his standing in the race was also an open question. A handful of Sanders\u2019s Democratic rivals sidestepped questions about Sanders\u2019s health on Saturday. In recent weeks, Warren has been rising in the polls, drawing large crowds and winning plaudits from prominent Democrats.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s running a better campaign at this point than Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders,\u201d said veteran Democratic strategist Mark Longabaugh, an architect of Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cAnd obviously, Sanders has had a very unfortunate incident that has pulled him off the trail. Biden has been pulled into the impeachment debate. Both demonstrate how unpredictable politics can be and how external events can upset the race.\u201d\n\nAmy B Wang contributed to this report.", "description": "The presidential candidate, who delayed revealing his heart attack for three days, promised to be at the next Democratic debate, on Oct. 15.", "authors": ["Sean Sullivan", "Reporter Covering National Politics", "Amy Gardner", "National Political Reporter", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RR1eUNQS0qXtxBjFf5YlSvKWiT0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7AQWNZHHYII6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
