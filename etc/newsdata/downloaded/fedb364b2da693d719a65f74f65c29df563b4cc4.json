Turner.\n\nFamed for his depictions of coastal landscapes, Turner replaces 18th Century economist Adam Smith as the current face of the 20 pound note.\n\nThe new polymer note is far more secure than the existing example which is Britain's most forged.\n\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney, left, pictured with Margate based artist Tracey Emin, right, launched the new \u00a320 bank note today featuring the artist JMW Turner\n\nThe new polymer note is far more secure than the one featuring economist Adam Smith\n\nIn 2021, a new \u00a350 note featuring pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing will be launched\n\nBoE Governor Mark Carney said: 'Our banknotes celebrate the UK's heritage, salute its culture, and testify to the achivements of its most notable individuals.\n\n'The new 20 pound note celebrates Turner, his art and his legacy in all their radiant, colourful, evocative glory.'\n\nThe BoE chose Turner, who died in 1851, from a shortlist of visual artists which included filmmaker Charlie Chaplin, sculptor Barbara Hepworth, painter William Hogarth and designer Josiah Wedgwood.\n\nMr Carney said: 'As the new Turner \u00a320 testifies, money can be a work of art in everyone's pocket.'\n\nThe new note depicts Turner's celebrated painting the Fighting Temeraire - a tribute to the ship HMS Temeraire which played a role in Nelson's victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.\n\nIt was voted the nation's favourite painting in a 2005 poll run by BBC Radio 4.\n\nOther features of the new banknote include the quote: 'Light is therefore colour', taken from an 1818 lecture by Turner referring to the use of light, shade, colour and tone in his pictures.\n\nTurner's signature from his will, the document with which he bequeathed many of his paintings to the nation, also appears on the new banknote.\n\nThe existing \u00a320 note is the most common of the Bank's notes in circulation, and also the most forged, making up around 88 per cent of detected banknote forgeries in the first half of this year according to Bank of England statistics.\n\nThe Bank said the new note is 'the most secure Bank of England banknote yet'.\n\nIt incorporates two windows and a two-colour foil to thwart counterfeiters.\n\nLike the polymer \u00a310, the new \u00a320 note will contain a tactile feature to help vision impaired people identify the denomination.\n\nThe new note will join the Sir Winston Churchill \u00a35 and the Jane Austen \u00a310.\n\nA new \u00a350 note, featuring Alan Turing, will follow in 2021.\n\nPeople can carry on spending the current paper \u00a320 notes, featuring the economist Adam Smith for now, and the Bank said that notice will be given six months ahead of legal tender status of the paper \u00a320 being withdrawn.\n\nThe design of the new note was launched at Turner Contemporary in Margate.\n\nMr Carney said: 'Turner's legacy endures today through his influence on art for over two centuries, to the prize that bears his name to celebrate British contemporary art, to this magnificent gallery, the Turner Contemporary.\n\n'Soon Turner's work will feature on another two billion works of art - the new \u00a320 notes from the Bank of England.'\n\nMr Carney said: 'Turner's contribution to art extends well beyond his favourite stretch of shoreline.\n\n'Turner's painting was transformative, his influence spanned lifetimes, and his legacy endures today.\n\n'The new \u00a320 note celebrates Turner, his art and his legacy in all their radiant, colourful, evocative glory.'\n\nThe new \u00a320 note will be the first to feature the signature of Sarah John, the Bank's chief cashier.\n\nShe said: 'The new \u00a320 is an important part of our commitment to providing banknotes that people can use with confidence.\n\n'Our polymer notes are much harder to counterfeit and, with the \u00a320 being our most common note, this marks a big step forward in our fight against counterfeiting.'\n\nOther features of the new banknote include:\n\nThe Bank of England said the new note was the most secure design ever released\n\n- A large see-through window with a blue and gold foil on the front depicting Margate lighthouse and Turner Contemporary. The foil is silver on the back. The shape of the large window is based on the shape of the fountains in Trafalgar Square.\n\n- A smaller see-through window in the bottom corner of the note, inspired by Tintern Abbey.\n\n- Turner's self-portrait, painted in around 1799 which is on display in Tate Britain.\n\n- A metallic hologram which changes between the word 'Twenty' and 'Pounds' when the note is tilted.\n\n- The Queen's portrait in the see-through window with '\u00a320 Bank of England' printed twice around the edge.\n\n- A silver foil patch with a 3D image of the coronation crown.\n\n- A purple foil patch containing the letter 'T' and based on the staircase at the Tate Britain.\n\nFurther details about the new \u00a320 note are available at www.thenew20.co.uk.\n\nFederation of Small Businesses (FSB) national chairman Mike Cherry, said: 'As the most common note in circulation, small firms will be pleased to see the money they are working with is going to become safer and more secure.\n\n'This will mean that small businesses can spend time and money on other issues away from fraud.'", "description": "Bank of England Governor Mark Carney today unveiled the new \u00a320 note featuring British artist JMW Turner who died in 1851.
