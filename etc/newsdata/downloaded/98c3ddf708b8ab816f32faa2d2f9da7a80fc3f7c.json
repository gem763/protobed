He sported No. 18 at practice Monday, two days after its former owner, Josh Doctson, missed the cut for Washington\u2019s 53-man roster.\n\nCoach Jay Gruden didn\u2019t say how the coaches and front office made their final determination of Doctson\u2019s fate, but called it \u201ca tough deal for Josh.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a shame,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cJosh is a good player and I wish him nothing but the best. At the end of the day we decided to go with Terry (McLaurin) at the X and keep Paul Richardson. And obviously the other guys are Trey Quinn and Steve Sims really emerged late as a weapon for us. So those are the guys we went with.\u201d\n\nDoctson landed with another team Monday when the Minnesota Vikings reportedly signed him to a one-year deal, reuniting him with former Washington quarterback Kirk Cousins. Nonetheless, when Washington parted ways with Doctson, it was a clear indication that the team had lost faith in a high draft pick who failed to live up to expectations.\n\nThe 22nd overall pick out of TCU three years ago, Doctson amassed just 81 catches for 1,100 yards and eight touchdowns in 33 games with Washington.\n\nWith Doctson out the door, Richardson is the only experienced wideout on the roster, having played more NFL snaps than the rest of Washington\u2019s options combined. Gruden said that didn\u2019t concern him.\n\n\u201cI feel confident about the guys we have,\u201d he said. \u201cTrey Quinn I think is well-versed, very experienced, as far as knowledge of the offense so he\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019ve got to get Steven, Terry and obviously (Kelvin) Harmon up to speed.\u201d\n\nMcLaurin, a rookie who only saw one snap during the preseason, becomes the de facto starter in Doctson\u2019s old \u201cX receiver\u201d role, which lines up on the line of scrimmage usually on the weak side of the offense. Gruden said the staff feels McLaurin is ready to start, but added that he doesn\u2019t have to be the nominal \u201cstarter\u201d there.\n\n\u201cI mean, he could come in and we can start Paul Richardson over there,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe can start Harmon at Z. We can do a lot of different things with our lineup. Trey Quinn can still play outside in base-personnel, two-receiver sets. So we have a lot of different options. They\u2019re all gonna get a chance to play and make some plays.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, tight end Vernon Davis gave McLaurin a ringing endorsement.\n\n\u201cHe is my favorite player on the team,\u201d Davis said. \u201cHe\u2019s very dynamic, explosive. He\u2019s fast. He does everything the right way \u2026 I look forward to seeing what he can bring to this team this year.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins may need all the help they can get in the pass-catching department. No. 1 tight end Jordan Reed missed another day of practice and remains in the concussion protocol. No formal injury reports will be released until Wednesday.\n\nMinus Doctson and with or without Reed, Washington\u2019s aerial attack, with new starting quarterback Case Keenum, will be tested in Week 1 by safety Malcolm Jenkins and the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 secondary.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
