McCarthy offered a pointed reminder to the troops Monday about obeying their commander in chief, amid open grumbling and criticism from current and former military members over President Trump\u2019s abrupt decision to pull out of Syria last week.\n\nAt the Association of the U.S. Army\u2019s annual conference in Washington Monday, Mr. McCarthy \u2014 officially sworn just two weeks ago \u2014 said he appreciates candor from the troops so long as it doesn\u2019t become disrespectful, a violation of military discipline.\n\n\u201cEverybody has opinions in the war of ideas. But, when national policy decisions are made, we salute and move on,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.\n\nThe reminder amounted to a tacit admission that Mr. Trump\u2019s Syria policy is causing problems for the Pentagon, which is dealing with a NATO ally in Turkey but has forged strong operational links with the Syrian Kurds, who provided the bulk of the ground firepower in the deadly campaign to defeat Islamic State. Mr. McCarthy said the issue is complicated, and if individual soldiers have questions, it\u2019s up to Army leadership to answer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure we don\u2019t have a challenge with a NATO ally. There\u2019s a lot of work that has to be done between us and our Turkish counterparts,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s willingness to leave the Kurds to fend for themselves has already proven a source of contention with his military leaders. Former Defense Secretary James Mattis and Brett McGurk, who had been the U.S. counter ISIS envoy, both quit the administration late last year to protest Mr. Trump\u2019s original pullout order in Syria.\n\nRetired Gen. Joseph Votel, who until March headed Central Command troops in the region, said last week Mr. Trump\u2019s move undercut five years of effort by U.S. forces in Syria and \u201cwill severely damage American credibility and reliability in any future fights where we need strong allies.\u201d\n\nAnd the Syria withdrawal isn\u2019t sitting well with at least some of the American troops who worked with Kurdish allies directly on the ground.\n\n\u201cI am ashamed for the first time in my career,\u201d a veteran Special Forces soldier who has been advising the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces told Fox News.\n\nThe Kurdish troops were often considered the most reliable local forces in the region. Their soldiers liberated ISIS-held towns like Raqqa and provided safe havens in their autonomous zone for a number of persecuted ethnic and religious minorities. Many U.S. military personnel are taking to Twitter anonymously, using the #miltwitter hashtag to register their unhappiness.\n\n\u201cIt is not the responsibility of servicemen to uphold the people in power, but to uphold the system, which are two completely different things,\u201d wrote a person identified as \u201cRabid Pelican\u201d on Twitter.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown whether the response from Mr. McCarthy about the Kurdish withdrawal would satisfy the ranks.\n\n\u201cWe, as active, reserve and veteran uniformed service members have souls. We have duties and responsibilities that don\u2019t end at\u201d the end of the day, wrote another military member on Twitter.\n\nGen. James C. McConville, the Army\u2019s chief of staff, said \u201chigher-level strategic politics\u201d were involved in the decision to pull out American troops from the Kurdish held region now under siege by Turkish military forces.\n\nBut the visceral reaction of some U.S. forces who served alongside the Kurds remains a problem.\n\n\u201cI feel physically ill with worry and concern and deeply ashamed that my own country would permit this fate to befall our close allies who did all our fighting for us, when we had the power to prevent it,\u201d one U.S. Marine who served in Syria in 2017-2018 told Foreign Policy.com.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
