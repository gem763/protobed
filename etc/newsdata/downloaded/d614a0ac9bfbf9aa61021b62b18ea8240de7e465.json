(Danielle \u201cDeejay\u201d Squires)\n\nJohn Neville and Danielle \u201cDeeJay\u201d Squires have been together for about six years. They\u2019ve been busy with two small children in the past few months and years, but they figured they\u2019d tie the knot someday.\n\n\u201cI always knew we would, but neither of us was in any rush,\u201d Neville said.\n\nWhen Squires was pregnant with their son four years ago, Neville secretly bought her a diamond engagement ring. He held onto it, trying to find just the right time to pop the question.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a procrastinator like you wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d Neville, 36, said. \u201cI kept twiddling my thumbs.\u201d\n\n\n\nJohn Neville and Danielle \u201cDeeJay\u201d Squires in a recent photo with their two children.

If anyone could grow a carrot in a ring, he felt confident it would be him.\n\n\u201cIt was a bit of a process,\u201d he said. \u201cI put a lot effort into it to make sure it was a successful engagement proposal.\u201d\n\n[A bride-to-be sent an invitation to the wrong address. It came back with this note.]\n\nFirst, he filled a five-gallon plastic bucket with soil but left a little room at the top. He then placed the ring in the center of the bucket and he pushed the ring down to bury it. He used a pencil to make a narrow hole in the soil right through the center of the ring, hoping to encourage the carrot to grow in that spot.\n\n\u201cI gingerly put a few granules of soil there and then three or four seeds on top,\u201d he said.\n\nHe sprinkled the rest of the carrot seeds around the perimeter of the bucket. Then he waited about 90 days. He said the bucket didn\u2019t need much tending.\n\nOn Saturday, he decided it was the day. He could see the carrots were maturing, and he didn\u2019t want them to get too big.\n\nHe pulled out the bucket and asked Squires, 32, and their 3-year-old, Eric, for help harvesting them.\n\nEric pulled a few from the outer edge of the bucket and Neville noticed, to his relief, that they looked well formed. Then he asked Squires to pull out the one in the center. He had no idea whether the carrot had grown inside the ring, whether his gamble had worked.\n\nAs she yanked on the carrot, Neville got down on one knee and blurted out: \u201cI love you. Will you marry me?\u201d\n\nNeville registered confusion on Squires\u2019s face. It took her a moment to realize the carrot she was holding also contained an engagement ring. His gamble had worked perfectly. Their son took a bite from the tip of the carrot.\n\n\u201cShe was a little bit confused for two seconds,\u201d Neville said. \u201cThen her eyes started welling up and she nodded her head yes.\u201d\n\n\n\nDanielle \u201cDeeJay\u201d Squires wearing her new engagement ring. (Danielle \u201cDeeJay\u201d Squires)\n\nSquires said she was in shock when he proposed because she was not at all expecting it in that moment. Their son kept asking why she was crying.\n\n\u201cThe more I think about it, the more amazing it is,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nJohn Neville and Danielle \u201cDeeJay\u201d Squires in 2014 (Courtesy Danielle Squires)\n\nSquires, a technologist in a hospital lab, said that after she posted on a Facebook group they are members of, Backyard Farming & Homesteading NL, people keep asking her when they plan to marry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not really sure,\u201d Squires said, adding that she\u2019s been getting a lot of attention since Neville\u2019s clever proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite an experience, for sure.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018Blinking Guy\u2019 uses viral GIF of himself for the first time, asks the Internet a favor\n\nPolice pack Texas football stands for fallen officer\u2019s son at his first game", "description": "As the groom-to-be grew the carrot in a 5-gallon bucket, he had no idea if it would grow inside the engagement ring as planned.
