The movie portrayed him as a bit of a rabble-rouser, but like all movies that are \u201cbased on true events,\u201d it was a bit off the mark. I found him to be a more enlightened individual than the movie portrayed. Skillful in pushing change, he used the Constitution and the word of law to enact his agenda of universal rights for all.\n\nToday\u2019s liberals who use bombast and self-promotion to make their points and could learn a lot from studying Thurgood\u2019s approach. Thurgood knew that putting gasoline on a fire never puts the fire out. Civil and thoughtful actions work. His life story is a testament to the value of civility.\n\nThurgood knew how to beat a bully; it isn\u2019t through emotional outbursts or loudly spoken demands. Instead, it is by carefully and coolly using the weapons at hand\u2014in this case, the law. And much of what Thurgood accomplished was through making allies and not enemies.\n\nFor instance, he didn\u2019t apply to the University of Maryland Law school, his local school. In the early part of the last century, African Americans couldn\u2019t attend the University of Maryland School of Law, which Thurgood knew. Instead, he went to Howard University to get his degree. After some strong mentoring by the new dean of Howard University's law school, he went into law to protect the oppressed. Once he had his own law practice, he met another young African American who actually had applied to the University of Maryland law school and was denied acceptance. While representing Donald Gaines Murray, Marshall eventually prevailed in getting Murray accepted to the school, winning his case before the State of Maryland Supreme Court. He had won the battle against the school to which he had once knew he would be denied attendance only when he had the tools at his disposal to fight.\n\nThurgood strongly believed in fighting hard for what was right and knew the law would follow. He was one of our country\u2019s strongest constitutional attorneys. Thirty-two times he represented people not getting a fair break in front of the United States Supreme Court. He won all but three of those cases. He won his first case at the Supreme Court at the age of thirty-two.\n\nHis most famous case was Brown v. Topeka Board of Education. He successfully argued that \u201cseparate was not equal,\u201d setting the stage for other public schools to accept people of all races. This landmark case broke apart the barriers that had prevented African American students from going to the schools of their choice.\n\nThurgood founded the NAACP legal arm and served in that post for twenty-five years. During that time, he created much of the legal legwork to support the later civil rights movement.\n\nWhile other civil rights activists worked against J. Edgar Hoover, Marshall found a way to make Hoover an ally. He pushed President Kennedy on civil rights and encouraged him to appoint more African American judges. In turn, he was appointed to the federal appellate court as a judge and later was appointed, by Kennedy, as the country\u2019s Solicitor General.\n\nWhen Lyndon Johnson became president, he appointed Thurgood as the first African American Supreme Court justice. It was a post he filled for 24 years. His service as a federal appellate judge had provided him with the necessary training to serve on our nation\u2019s highest court.\n\nMany may not know the deeper history of this wonderful American. His story isn\u2019t just about what he accomplished, but more about how he accomplished his goals. He was certainly liberal in his views, but not blindly so. He didn\u2019t vote strictly on party lines but on what he believed was right, leading some of the most conservative judges to respect him. He didn\u2019t push for change until he had the right tools and information.\n\nThurgood knew that getting into wars of words with bullies was a dead-end street. He needed facts and the law to support his causes. He avoided celebrity to focus on the truth. As with his battle with the University of Maryland, he didn\u2019t forget; instead, he returned to fight when he was prepared as a lawyer and used the Constitution to win his case.\n\nJesus tells us to stand up for the weak and to fight for the downtrodden. But Jesus also told us to be wise as serpents and kind as doves. This was Thurgood\u2019s approach. In a very Christian manner, he pushed hard but not at the expense of civility.\n\nWhile others will squawk about what\u2019s unfair, they forget to make allies. In their haste to get what they want, they forget about the barriers that angry discourse creates. Thurgood knew that any cause that is just will attract honorable people while name-calling attracts the wrong supporters.\n\nThurgood Marshall is not the most visibly famous of the advocates for the universal rights for all people. But he is certainly the one who most changed the course of civil rights in America.\n\nWrong is wrong and always needs to be corrected. There is always a need for immediacy to all change. Importantly, change needs two things: allies and intellect. Thurgood was a model for others to follow in affecting change. Angry rhetoric will not move the angry bear called injustice, calmness will. Power isn\u2019t given up by clanging cymbals together, but through genuine intellect. Those who seek to push back injustices while obtaining celebrity will not succeed. Those who seek to remove injustice with compassion in their heart will succeed.\n\nThurgood Marshall was a great American, and he knew our Constitution well. He may not be the most famous civil rights advocate, but he was certainly one of its most effective.", "description": "I recently watched the movie, Marshall, and became interested in .09/08/2019 7:38:09AM EST.", "authors": ["Bruce Hartman", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/302/47e3ba4a-735f-405d-861d-50465a4c8387.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
