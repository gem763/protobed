A win would have been among the greatest results in Northern Ireland\u2019s history, while a draw would have kept open a realistic path to Euro 2020 qualification out of Group C. The eventual defeat simply left Michael O\u2019Neill \u201cdevastated\u201d. While this match carries no such importance on paper, a good performance and a result to match would go a long way towards lifting spirits.\n\nSquad rotation\n\nNorwich goalkeeper Michael McGovern is expected to start in Prague (Joe Giddens/PA)\n\nThere will be keen interest in O\u2019Neill\u2019s team selection for the match. Plenty of changes are expected, with the manager keen to give time on the pitch to several members of his squad who are sorely in need of it. Michael McGovern is expected to start in goal while the likes of Tom Flanagan, Ciaron Brown, Jordan Thompson, Liam Donnelly, Gavin Whyte and Shayne Lavery will hope to see game time. St Johnstone winger Matthew Kennedy could make his debut.\n\nCzechs on a high\n\nGET IN!!! FULL-TIME!\n\n\n\nFantastic performance and even better result! \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddff 2-1 \ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc65\udb40\udc6e\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc7f pic.twitter.com/FPybUblhcp \u2014 Czech Football Team (@ceskarepre_eng) October 11, 2019\n\nWhile Northern Ireland were floored by Holland\u2019s flurry of late goals in Rotterdam, the hosts come into the game riding high from Friday\u2019s 2-1 home win over England \u2013 a first qualifying defeat in 44 games for the Three Lions. It was all the more impressive given they fell behind to a penalty inside the opening five minutes. Like Northern Ireland, plenty of changes are expected to Jaroslav Silhavy\u2019s side, but morale will be high throughout the group.\n\nGoals at a premium?\n\nChris Brunt, second right, scored Northern Ireland\u00b4s second in a 2-0 win over the Czech Republic in 2017 (Brian Lawless/PA)\n\nNorthern Ireland won the last meeting between the two sides \u2013 a World Cup qualifier in 2017 \u2013 2-0. But those were the first goals scored between the two sides in over 15 years, with the previous three meetings all finishing 0-0.\n\nPlay-off watch\n\nGroup C \ud83e\udd29\n\n\n\nWho are you backing?#EURO2020 pic.twitter.com/9kBrasfYsq \u2014 UEFA EURO 2020 (@UEFAEURO) October 9, 2019\n\nNorthern Ireland fans could be forgiven for spending much of Monday night more concerned with results elsewhere. While their chances of getting out of Group C are not dead yet, the play-offs look a much more realistic possibility for O\u2019Neill\u2019s men if they are to qualify for next summer\u2019s finals, so all eyes now are on how the field begins to shape up. With Northern Ireland ranked 24th in the Nations League rankings, they need no more than four teams from Nations Leagues C and D to secure automatic qualification in order to be sure of their play-off place. Fans will have the play-off simulator on UEFA\u2019s website on constant refresh.", "description": "It may be only a friendly in Prague but Michael O\u00b4Neill will look for his team to bounce back while giving playing time to different squad members.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/10/wire-19650154-1570957426-158_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
