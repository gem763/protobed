As the decades scrolled by, and Harrelson was revealed to be more of a dreamy, distracted pothead than an outright dope, he was perfectly game to make fun of that, too. Despite his willingness to play to his persona, Harrelson\u2019s SNL gigs haven\u2019t really provided that many memorable moments. Sure, there are plenty of worthy sketches, including \u201cTake Your Shirt Off\u201d from \u201992 and \u201cMatch\u2019d\u201d from \u201914, but these owe more to fun ideas than anything writers did for Harrelson. This week\u2019s show didn\u2019t add anything particularly noteworthy to his SNL history, but as usual, he has a handful of bright moments, including him stepping into Jason Sudeikis\u2019s vacated shoes to portray presidential hopeful Joe Biden.\n\nThough overall the season premiere isn\u2019t quite the bang for which SNL might hope, there are enough strong bits to keep things moving along. One of the most exciting elements of the show: New players Bowen Yang and Chloe Fineman got used quite a bit, popping up in several sketches and each given their own moments to shine.\n\n\ufeffAs a reminder here at the beginning of the season, we list sketches from best to worst \u2014 so if you\u2019re not a completist, you can watch the first few and leave the rest behind.\n\nDNC Town Hall\n\nIn order to thoroughly slow down the impeachment proceedings, the presidential candidates gather for a town hall. Though the stage is full of bodies, there are only four hopefuls that moderator Erin Burnett (Cecily Strong) identifies as potential winners: Joe Biden (Harrelson), Kamala Harris (Maya Rudolph), Bernie Sanders (Larry David), and Elizabeth Warren (Kate McKinnon). Warren wants to fight, Harris wants to be America\u2019s fun aunt, or \u201cfunt,\u201d and Bernie\u2019s Bernie. The scrutiny keeps returning to Biden, who defends himself: \u201cI\u2019m like plastic straws: I\u2019ve been around forever, I\u2019ve always worked, and now you\u2019re mad at me?\u201d There\u2019s a bit too much going on to really drill down on many of the candidates, but the writers endow Uncle Joe with a distinct creepiness, confusion, and some antiquated notions about race. Many of the players have but mere moments to show off their impressions, and the most successful are those candidates who are a bit larger targets \u2014 including chummy Beto O\u2019Rourke (Alex Moffat) and spacey Marianne Williamson (Chloe Fineman).\n\nApple Picking Ad\n\nIt\u2019s apple-picking season, and two farmhand sisters (Aidy Bryant and McKinnon) invite city dwellers to Chickham\u2019s Apple Farm \u2014 where, for $45, \u201cyou can bring home just $10 worth of apples.\u201d The groundskeeper is a \u201ctroubled man\u201d called Hank (Harrelson), whom the sisters \u201cpay in dentistry.\u201d There\u2019s also a depressed donkey (\u201cHe\u2019s like Eeyore with a plan.\u201d), lots of penis-shaped gourds, and a haunted hayride run by teen boys who take things a little too seriously. The sketch is stuffed with great, observational jokes about one of the great fall pastimes for yankees \u2014 too many to quote them all here. It seems likely that Anna Drezen and Alison Gates, who wrote last season\u2019s \u201cRomano Tours,\u201d probably had a hand in this delightful 10-to-1, too.\n\nImpeachment Cold Open\n\nAfter impeachment proceedings begin, Trump (Alec Baldwin) calls just about everyone in his phone \u2014 Rudy Giuliani (McKinnon), William Barr (Bryant), Mike Pence (Beck Bennett), and on and on and on. He gets advice from Kim Jong-un (Bowen Yang), gets dumped by Kanye (Chris Redd), and receives a little pick-me-up from the sycophantic Janine Pirro (Cecily Strong). While players like Strong and McKinnon continue to sharpen their impressions, Baldwin\u2019s Trump carries on into further cartoonishness. It\u2019s interesting that his grousing over the summer that he hated playing Trump didn\u2019t stop him from coming back for more. At this point Baldwin\u2019s Trump, like these huge ensemble sketches that give everyone a line or two, feels more like a required gesture than incisive satire.\n\nInside the Beltway\n\nOn this political chat show, three white pundits talk about Trump\u2019s impeachment as \u201ca turning point\u201d for the administration, while one black man (Kenan Thompson) insists that \u201cain\u2019t nothing gonna happen.\u201d There are clips of this analyst saying much the same thing when the \u201cgrab \u2019em by the pussy\u201d tape was leaked in 2016, and when the Mueller report came out in May of this year. This feels like a corollary to \u201cElection Night,\u201d with Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock, in which all white people were crushed by Hillary\u2019s demise, while black folks were not at all surprised. The premise is clear and cleanly executed until a dresser\u2019s premature entrance kept the cast losing it through the end of the sketch. Happily, NBC opted to make this version available online\u2014rather than the dress rehearsal \u2014 as mistakes like this highlight the joyful unpredictability of live TV.\n\nWeekend Update\n\nMuch of Update\u2019s first chunk deals with the impeachment inquiry, which in Michael Che\u2019s understanding means, \u201cHe\u2019s getting fired? Let\u2019s get drunk!\u201d Some of Colin Jost\u2019s best jabs are slipped in between the bigger jokes, including one bit in which he pokes at Trump\u2019s terrible grammar: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to be a grammar Nazi, I know you hate one of those things.\u201d It\u2019s odd that the quip-heavy Update has come to rely on as many news clips as it has; the segment is short, comparatively speaking, and there are languid recaps of Giuliani\u2019s unhinged behavior available on six other late-night shows.\n\nThen Kenan Thompson comes on to play former Boston Red Sox player David Ortiz, who has been coping with being shot earlier this summer in the Dominican Republic. As it has long since found its formula, this bit remains the same: Ortiz fantasizes about food and does a few impromptu commercials for products such as \u201cHairbnb\u201d and the \u201cPossible Burger.\u201d While there\u2019s nothing surprising about the bit, Thompson\u2019s joy is infectious.\n\nDownton Abbey Trailer\n\nThis movie trailer celebrates the release of the Downton Abbey movie, and all of its ostensible drama: The servants must clean everything before the king and queen arrive (in a year and a half), there\u2019s mud discovered at the bottom of the lake, and there must be other foods beside bread. \u201cWere the stakes in the show always so low?\u201d one review asks. Another says that the movie \u201cfeels like watching the sun set on white people as a whole.\u201d No matter, moms will love it. The sketch does a nice job of repurposing all of the staid cliches in Downton, and mannered British period drama in general, to confirm that there just isn\u2019t all that much going on. While most performances are meant to blend into a homogenous mass rather than stand out, McKinnon\u2019s cockeyed Dame Maggie Smith is a little show all its own.\n\nWoody Harrelson Monologue\n\nRiding high on his Esquire cover and being identified as a well-dressed celebrity, Harrelson is feeling his oats enough to forgo the writers\u2019 attempts to help him write a monologue. After announcing that he can\u2019t say anything wrong, he immediately catches himself talking about immigrants, Fox News viewers, and the Chinese in ways they might find unflattering. He starts apologizing, and it only gets worse. Eventually, he\u2019s apologizing for using the word \u201cpussyfoot,\u201d just in case anyone watching has \u201cpussy feet.\u201d This is SNL\u2019s way of addressing the hiring and subsequent firing of Shane Gillis without coming right out and saying his name. It\u2019s a strange way to start, given that most of the punchlines require some apologetic dissembling, but Woody seems more than game to play along. Surely SNL knows the difference between putting overt, silly slips in Harrelson\u2019s mouth and the casual racism that got Gillis in trouble, but so be it, let the show vent.\n\nDad\n\nIn an unnamed campy \u201990s TV drama, a kid named Scotty (Kyle Mooney) appeals to his busy professional of a father (Harrelson), a guy who always seems to be on his appropriately large cell phone. While waiting to explain something about a failed math test, Scotty imagines a big rap number in which he confesses his admiration for his dad and his own need for attention. The sketch returns to one of Mooney\u2019s preoccupations \u2014 the stilted, issue-based edutainment of the era \u2014 without adding much to it. The rap has an enjoyable cringe factor, though, and it\u2019s benefitted by the appearance of Scotty\u2019s religious pal Colby (Redd). There\u2019s also a nice zig as Dad prepares to participate in his kid\u2019s rap and ends up disappointing anyway.\n\nLocker Room\n\nDuring his inspirational halftime speech, the coach of the Timbrook Fighting Corgis (Harrelson) gets interrupted by his new wife, Trinity (Gardner). The young and less-than-clever lass won\u2019t stop talking about the coach\u2019s \u201cthing,\u201d how its vein came all the way out, how it made sounds like Donald Duck. Soon, the guys on the team are more obsessed about coach\u2019s dong than they are about victory on the field. So, yeah, a prolonged dick joke. Gardner does her best to find a little nuance in the dumb blonde she\u2019s got to play, but there\u2019s not all that much to find when it\u2019s four minutes about a quacking dick and its gross-out veins.\n\nRoadside Museum\n\nIn SNL\u2019s latest bit of sponcon, the Hodder family (Harrelson, Bryant, and Day) go on morning show Sun\u2019s Out Nevada! to tout the world\u2019s largest Cheeto museum and show off the world\u2019s largest Cheeto. They\u2019ve sunk their fortune into the place, but unfortunately, the orange abomination slips from its ornamental stand, falls into a whirling fan blade, and explodes in a burst of cheese dust. The cast gamely looks for hooks \u2014 Bryant as long-suffering wife, Day as overenthusiastic son \u2014 but the material itself doesn\u2019t have much room for them to play. Eh, hopefully it paid a few bills.\n\nMuch of the show\u2019s energy this week comes through in its first two sketches, which felt like back-to-back cold opens; they might have saved the Town Hall for next week, and saved a chunk of the show\u2019s running time. Though it was nice to see a guest host as one of the political heavyweights, presumably Harrelson was only playing Biden as a pick-up, and either Jason Sudeikis will come back or someone else in the cast will step up. Next week, the rightfully beloved Phoebe Waller-Bridge hosts for the first time.", "description": "A reliably affable and game Harrelson guides SNL through a mostly by-the-book season premiere.
