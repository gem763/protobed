They published their analysis of the footprints on Monday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nFootprints are scarce in the human fossil record and experts in human origins value them because they are a signature of movement and behavior. \u201cThe footprints represent a snapshot of the life of Neanderthals,\u201d said paleoanthropologist Jeremy Duveau at the museum in Paris, who led the research team.\n\nOne of the 257 Neanderthal footprints found buried under a seaside creek bottom at Le Rozel.

The smallest footprints measured 4.4 inches long, big enough to fit a modern size 4 shoe suitable for a toddler. The largest were more adult, measuring 11 inches or so.\n\nThey hint at how Neanderthals might have supervised their young.\n\n\u201cI loved this image of a prehistoric day care\u2014a couple of adults and trailing behind them are all these kids,\u201d said paleoanthropologist Jeremy DeSilva at Dartmouth College, who studies the evolution of walking. He wasn\u2019t involved in the project. \u201cThis is some beautiful evidence that children were being watched after by their parents and others.\u201d\n\nThe researchers also found eight handprints imprinted in the hardened fine-grained sand. Those are the only known direct imprints of Neanderthal hands, the scientists said. Images of hands believed to have been painted by Neanderthals were found last year in Spain stenciled alongside 65,000-year-old cave art.\n\nThe sand prints were found buried under a seaside creek bottom between the beach and a cliff at Le Rozel in Normandy, about 16 miles from Cherbourg, where French anthropologists have been excavating since 2012. Between 70,000 and 115,000 years ago, the area was a broad stretch of sand dunes.\n\nIn all, the scientists found 257 footprints preserved in several layers of sediments, indicating the site had been used off and on for many years. Windblown grit had rapidly covered and preserved the impressions left by feet in sandy mud, the scientists said.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw the numbers involved here\u2014257 Neanderthal footprints\u2014my jaw hit the floor,\u201d said Dr. DeSilva at Dartmouth. Until now, only a few prehistoric footprints found in Europe have been reliably identified as Neanderthal, he said.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How do you think this discovery will affect current scientific knowledge?

They didn\u2019t, however, find any fossil human remains, complicating their effort to identify which early species had walked there.\n\nDozens of the tracks showed clear impressions of a well-rounded heel and individual toes, the scientists said. Generally, the footprints were broader than those typically left by modern humans, the scientists said.\n\nBased on the length and width of various tracks, the researchers estimated that the individuals ranged from about two feet (66 cm) tall to about 6 feet (189.2 cm) tall. More than half of them were less than 4 feet 2 inches tall (130 cm).\n\nBased on anatomy, the antiquity of the site and the style of stone tools at the site, the researchers concluded they could only have been made by Neanderthals.\n\n\u201cWe can conclude the group was composed of a majority of children,\u201d said Dr. Duveau. \u201cIt is difficult to say it is a family group because we don\u2019t have genetic data.\u201d\n\nWrite to Robert Lee Hotz at sciencejournal@wsj.com", "description": "Tracing steps through sands of time, scientists have uncovered hundreds of footprints left by Neanderthal children, adolescents and adults as they walked the ancient wind-swept dunes of coastal Normandy in France, a new study says.", "authors": ["Robert Lee Hotz", "Lee.Hotz Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105250/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
