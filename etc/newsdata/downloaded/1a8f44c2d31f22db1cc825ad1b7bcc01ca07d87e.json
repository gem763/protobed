Friends \u2014 never, ever buy a car from these companies \u2014 and let them know it\u2026 \u2014 Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 29, 2019\n\nThe three automakers filed papers in federal court this week seeking to join a lawsuit that the Trump administration is bringing against California over whether the state can set auto emission rules for itself and 13 other states that would be the strictest in the country.\n\nThey are being joined in their fight by Nissan, Mazda, Kia, and Hyundai.\n\nThe White House is arguing that individual states are prohibited from imposing their own tailpipe emission standards and zero-emission vehicle mandates, and that policy should be set on a nationwide level.\n\nIn an industry split, automakers Ford, BMW, and Honda have declined to join the lawsuit, effectively siding with California.\n\nThirteen other states, including Washington D.C., have adopted California\u2019s clean car standards: New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, Washington, Vermont, New York, Maine, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Colorado.\n\nIn his Twitter rant this week, Roger & Me director Moore blasted traditional automobiles as posing an existential threat to Earth and must be eliminated.\n\n\u201cAll internal combustion engine cars are a threat to the planet and must be phased out ASAP,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLight rail, bullet trains, low/no emission buses, ride-sharing, less sprawl/vertical living, low-consumption neighborhoods and safe bicycle and walking paths, please.\u201d\n\n\u2026 Note: All internal combustion engine cars are a threat to the planet and must be phased out ASAP. Light rail, bullet trains, low/no emission buses, ride-sharing, less sprawl/vertical living, low-consumption neighborhoods and safe bicycle and walking paths, please. \u2014 Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 29, 2019\n\nThe Oscar-winning filmmaker praised Honda, Ford, and BMW for splitting with their competitors, saying that they \u201csided with Earth.\u201d\n\nOpponents of California\u2019s auto standard say that it would hurt employment and competitiveness at a time when many manufacturing jobs have been shipped overseas.\n\nMoore once sided with autoworkers in his native Michigan. Roger & Me depicted the filmmaker\u2019s efforts to track down former GM CEO Roger Smith after the company shut down factories in the city of Flint.\n\nBut the Fahrenheit 9/11 director has since become a vociferous climate change activist.\n\nMoore blamed, in a separate Twitter rant last month, the Republican Party for bringing about the extinction of the human race.\n\n\u201cThis party triggered our extinction by pushing a greed-based, climate-denying agenda.\u201d\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
