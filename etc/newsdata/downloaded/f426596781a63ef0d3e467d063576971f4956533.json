It''s the 22nd not 22th.\"\n\nWell, if you're as confused as we are, here's everything we know about the wedding! Read on.\n\n1. According to all the existing reports, Ranbir and Alia are planning to tie the knot in France. The caterers for the wedding have already been booked.\n\n2. Reports claim that Ranbir had a few confidential meetings with Sabyasachi and Alia Bhatt also was seen jetting off to an undisclosed foreign trip.\n\n3. The tentative dates for the wedding are 8th, 9th, and 10th of November, 2019 and Chef Ritu Dalmia, who also curated Virushka\u2019s extravagant Italian wedding, has been approached for the catering.\n\nMeanwhile, Alia Bhatt has denied rumours that she is tying the knot on January 22.\n\nQuizzed by the paparazzi at Mumbai airport, she stopped and smiled, and added: \"What do I say?!\" After a pause, she said: \"No\". On the work front, Ranbir and Alia will be seen together in Ayan Mukerji''s \"Brahmastra\", which is expected to release next year. The film also stars Amitabh Bachchan.", "description": "Amidst rumored wedding dates, wedding invites and other reports around their wedding, Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt were spotted chilling in London.
