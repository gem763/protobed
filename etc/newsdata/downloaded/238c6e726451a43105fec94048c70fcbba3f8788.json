It was the type of comment that would\u2019ve made viewers new to Drag Race wonder why there was any need to post the tweet at all. After all, isn\u2019t kindness the least we should all expect? Something we shouldn\u2019t have to publicly beg for?\n\nThe answer is, of course, yes. And in the majority of queer circles, communities thrive alongside one another. But De Campo has been performing for 15 years, and will unfortunately have come into contact with the type of toxic abuse that so often affects LGBT+ people, whether in the form of homophobic or transphobic slurs or within the LGBT+ community itself. So she has her reasons to fear the worst from the show.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHomophobia from outside the community is self-explanatory. But De Campo was alluding to something else: the cliche that bitchiness prevails in queer circles \u2013 and more specifically, the outdated stereotype that drag as a genre has cattiness and bitchiness at its centre.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering where the supposedly \u201cwoke\u201d RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race fits into all this, I\u2019d argue that the original US show has often promoted negative stereotypes about the LGBT+ community. This promotion of negative stereotypes has been carried over to the UK show.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Katy Raddatz/Museum of Performance and Design 4/25 22. Madonna - Vogue (1990) Madonna took voguing from the ballroom culture of New York\u2019s black LGBT scene and repackaged it for a global audience, bringing along some of its best dancers for her iconic music video. Her rap, which name-checks Hollywood screen legends, is one of pop\u2019s campest moments. Sire/Warner Bros. Records 5/25 21. Paris is Burning (1990) While \u201cVogue\u201d was for mainstream consumption, the cult documentary Paris Is Burning went behind the scenes of the glamorous ballroom culture, exploring the darker reality of those outcast and stigmatised by a hostile society. Alamy 6/25 20. Carol and Susan's wedding on Friends (1996) While Friends has often been criticised over its LGBT representation, this was one moment it did get right. Rex Features 7/25 19. Macklemore - Same Love (2012) As a rap song advocating for same-sex marriage, \u201cSame Love\u201d sends a impactful message of support from a traditionally hostile area of the music world. Youtube 8/25 18. Britney and Madonna kiss at the VMAs (2003) An obvious and bizarre publicity stunt, but this split-second snog at the MTV VMAs is surely the most famous same-sex kiss of all time. Getty 9/25 17. The Golden Girls tackle gay marriage (1991) Our beloved Miami foursome weren\u2019t just camp icons \u2013 they were ardent LGBT allies. In one much-discussed episode, Blanche is upset that her brother is marrying a man. Sophia gives an impassioned speech, saying: \u201cEveryone wants someone to grow old with \u2013 and shouldn\u2019t everyone have that chance?\u201d Alamy 10/25 16. Christina Aguilera's \"Beautiful\" video (2002) The gay kiss featured in this memorable video was a huge signal to a generation of kids that their feelings were normal, and that individuality was to be celebrated. An LGBT anthem was born. Youtube 11/25 15. Stephen Fry introduces Grindr on Top Gear (2009) Grindr was brand new when Stephen Fry showed it off to Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson, and his estimated global audience of about 350 million. App downloads quickly shot up, and gay hook-up culture was never the same again. BBC 12/25 14. Ellen DeGeneres comes out (1997) Now the most-high profile lesbian in the world, Ellen took the bull by the horns when she came out in a memorable episode of her sitcom, with a simultaneous cover of Time magazine on which she declared: \u201cYep, I\u2019m gay.\u201d 13/25 13. Queer As Folk (1999) Russel T Davies\u2019s groundbreaking Channel 4 series was unapologetic in its portrayal of gay men and their sex lives, and taught a pearl-clutching British public about rimming. Channel 4 14/25 12. Moonlight wins Best Picture (2017) A powerful portrayal of a young black man coming to terms with his sexuality, Moonlight broke through barriers for LGBT, black and Muslim representation when it triumphed at the Oscars. Getty Images 15/25 11. Modern Family (2009) One of the most successful TV shows in the world, Modern Family succeeded in portraying Mitchell and Cameron as parents just as capable of raising (and embarrassing) their daughter as any straight couple. 20th Television 16/25 10. Boy George on Top of the Pops (1982) When Culture Club appeared on Top of the Pops to perform \u201cDo You Really Want To Hurt Me?\u201d, the androgynous look of its colourful frontman threw viewers and the UK tabloids into a spin. BBC 17/25 9. Lady Gaga - \u201cBorn This Way\u201d (2011) Lady Gaga\u2019s love of the LGBT community, and her status as \"Mother Monster\" for all outcasts, was brilliantly channelled into this mainstream dance hit. In a rebuke to religious inspired homophobia, she delivered the poignant lyric: \u201cI\u2019m beautiful in my way, cos God makes no mistakes.\u201d 18/25 8. Caitlyn Jenner on Vanity Fair & Laverne Cox on Time (2014, 2015) Orange Is the New Black star Laverne Cox was the first transgender woman on the cover of Time magazine, while Caitlyn Jenner presented herself for the first time on the cover of Vanity Fair the following year. Transgender people were being seen, understood and appreciated like never before. 19/25 7. George Michael - Outside (1998) Six months after being spectacularly outed after an incident in a Los Angeles public toilet, George Michael decided to own it, with this number one single, complete with an outrageously tongue-in-cheek video about cruising. Jaw-dropping to this day. Youtube 20/25 6. Glee (2009) Glee presented high-camp musical numbers and wacky plot lines alongside some of the first openly gay and transgender characters seen within a high school setting. Its impact on a post-millennial generation of kids forging their own queer identities was enormous. Fox 21/25 5. Brokeback Mountain (2005) Perhaps the most famous LGBT film of all time, Brokeback Mountain was the first to put a gay relationship front and centre in a mainstream Hollywood plot. Focus/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock 22/25 4. Queen at Live Aid (1985) Freddie Mercury wasn\u2019t open about his sexuality when he stole the show at Live Aid, but he was unmistakably one of our own. His 20-minute tour de force in front of two billion TV viewers goes down in history as the greatest rock performance of all time. Alamy Stock Photo 23/25 3. Philadelphia (1993) The first mainstream film to portray the HIV/Aids crisis was built on a haunting performance from Tom Hanks and brought an understanding of the issue to millions of cinemagoers. Rex Features 24/25 2. RuPaul's Drag Race (2009) The show that launched a thousand memes. RuPaul\u2019s incredible popularity is a testament to how widely the show reached out beyond the LGBT community and into the wider public, who have been duly educated about drag culture and the courage of those who take part. Getty Images 25/25 1. Will and Grace (1998) Will and Grace was the first time a sitcom put gay characters front and centre, and delighted audiences with its razor-sharp wit. Joe Biden once said the show \u201cprobably did more to educate the American public\u201d on gay issues than anything else. Powerful stuff. Rex Features 1/25 25.

Joe Biden once said the show \u201cprobably did more to educate the American public\u201d on gay issues than anything else. Powerful stuff. Rex Features\n\nEven in the first episode, contestants were shown making catty comments about one another on and off camera, and behind each others\u2019 backs. Sensational edits are frequently made to show queens side-eyeing one another, fighting with each other and getting into slagging matches. And on every episode, contestants are taken into a Big Brother-style room to purposefully bitch about other contestants.\n\nYou might say that the fighting is an authentic representation of what\u2019s actually going on during filming. And I\u2019d agree to a small extent. As De Campo said in her tweet, \u201cfilming this has been one of the most intense experiences I\u2019ve ever been involved in, nothing else even comes close\u201d.\n\nAnd at times, this means contestants do snark at one another, with one seeming disapproving that another hadn\u2019t been to a drag show before and another calling a contestant\u2019s look \u201chalf missing\u201d.\n\nBut by the end of the episode, the sensation and drama had been ramped up to an entirely unrealistic level. The music sounded like the stuff theme parks play when you\u2019re about to board a rollercoaster; it only served to make tight cuts of contestants shouting at one another seem awkwardly inauthentic when screened seconds after other shots showcasing the group\u2019s clear closeness.\n\nThis sort of editing crassly and grossly sensationalises any small disagreements between contestants. By doing so, it perpetuates negative stereotypes about queer people to suggest that all they can do is argue and fight with one another.\n\nAs East End queen Baga Chipz surmised early in the episode: \u201cEveryone\u2019s friendly, you know what I mean? You normally do get the odd twat though don\u2019t you.\u201d But from what I could glean from the first episode, any unsavoury characters are far more likely to be found in the editing suite (or higher up, in creative meetings about the show\u2019s style and direction) than in a fabulous dress.\n\nThat we\u2019re being fed this fake in-fighting feels even more absurd when you consider how the UK drag culture differs from its American counterpart. In the UK, our innovative drag scene celebrates queerness in its original form, meaning difference: queens, particularly in east London, have beards, hairy chests, and are, as Drag Race UK queen Crystal put it, \u201ca little bit more punk, a little bit more gender-f*ck, kind of the alternative style of drag.\u201d\n\nIn other words: we don\u2019t have time for cattiness. If we\u2019re competitive, we\u2019re competitive in a friendly and intellectual way; more interested in gender politics and equality than landing shallow jibes or achieving shallow aesthetic perfection.\n\nI\u2019m going to surprise you now by revealing that I actually rather enjoyed the season premiere of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK. On the whole, I thought it did a good job of taking the show from one side of the Atlantic Ocean to the other. RuPaul handled well his blind spots about UK queer culture, admitting that he didn\u2019t know who people such as Kim Woodburn were. Where he was unfamiliar, he asked the right questions to educate himself.\n\nCrucially, he was open-minded to our drag culture. Now all that I ask is that the big TV producer bosses that\u2019re making editorial decisions about how RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK will look and feel are open-minded too \u2013 and that they stop portraying us as an arguing, fraught and bitchy community. It\u2019s honestly the last thing we need.", "description": "As excitement mounted in the hours before the premiere of Drag Race UK, contestant Divina De Campo tweeted a plea: \u201cI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is be kind to us all,\u201d she urged. \u201cWe are all only human.\u201d It was a simple request \u2013 some might say almost disarmingly simple.
