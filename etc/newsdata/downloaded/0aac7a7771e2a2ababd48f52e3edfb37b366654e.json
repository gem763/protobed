Aritaum Live stores sell cosmetics from multiple brands, unlike Aritaum stores, which only sell Amorepacific products. The company has been rapidly increasing the number of Aritaum Live stores since the first launched in September last year. There are now 370.Last week, its rival LG Household & Health Care posted 1.96 trillion won in sales and 311.8 billion won in operating profit in the third quarter. Its on-year sales jumped 13.1 percent while the operating profit increased 12.4 percent compared to the same period a year ago.BY JIN MIN-JI [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
