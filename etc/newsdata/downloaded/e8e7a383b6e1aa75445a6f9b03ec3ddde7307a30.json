Biden Jr. was quickly pressed on the issue of his son Hunter Biden and his work for a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president. Mr. Biden responded to a question about his son\u2019s overseas work in narrow and repetitive terms, saying several times that he and his son had done \u201cnothing wrong.\u201d\n\nThe drawn-out argument over health care, in a debate sponsored by CNN and The New York Times, captured one of the defining themes in the Democratic race: the ideological divide over the best way to provide universal coverage, and over the proper scale and cost of government-backed social programs. Up to this point, the Democrats\u2019 policy debate has largely been defined by Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, with their promises to restructure huge parts of the American economy. The debate in Ohio represented the most assertive effort so far by candidates skeptical of their policies to put up resistance to those ideas.\n\nThe fierce exchange also signaled that the race had entered a new phase, defined by Ms. Warren\u2019s apparent status as a leader of the Democratic pack and a new mood of urgency among other candidates eager to challenge that status.\n\nMr. Sanders, who has observed a kind of informal nonaggression pact with Ms. Warren so far, did not exactly break from that approach on Tuesday night. But he called it \u201cappropriate\u201d for candidates to explain the fiscal trade-offs involved in a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d system: Mr. Sanders said that voters would see their taxes go up, but that they would save money overall because of the way health care would be restructured.\n\n\u201cPremiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, adding, \u201cThe tax increase they pay will be substantially less, substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d", "description": "The criticism of Elizabeth Warren illustrated her status as an emerging front-runner, while Joe Biden faced scrutiny over his son\u2019s financial dealings overseas.", "authors": ["Jonathan Martin", "Alexander Burns"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/15/us/politics/15debate-ledeall1/15debate-ledeall1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
