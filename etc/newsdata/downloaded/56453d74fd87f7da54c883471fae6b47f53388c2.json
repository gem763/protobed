It would have been strange had any been invited: Saudi government agents are accused of killing Khashoggi on that Tuesday last year, of dismembering his body, of concealing the location of his remains.\n\nThe agents were dispatched by top Saudi officials, convinced that Khashoggi\u2019s words, written in columns for The Post, were a grave threat to the state. The officials worked for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who almost certainly authorized the killing, according to the CIA and other intelligence agencies, but who has steadfastly denied it.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d was Mohammed\u2019s answer, when asked recently whether he had ordered Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nNone of Khashoggi\u2019s Saudi relatives attended on Wednesday, either, including his children, but that too was expected. Khashoggi\u2019s killing aggravated arguments between Saudi Arabia and Turkey, and to travel to the Istanbul memorial was to take a side in that argument, something no Saudi citizen could afford to do.\n\nAD\n\nInstead, Khashoggi\u2019s life and legacy were celebrated Wednesday by friends, colleagues and supporters, including Arab political exiles, whose ranks he had reluctantly joined. Among others in attendance were his fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, who had paced outside the consulate, waiting fruitlessly for him to emerge; Jeff Bezos, the owner of The Post; Frederick J. Ryan Jr., the paper\u2019s publisher; and Agnes Callamard, a United Nations human rights investigator who authored a report that provided the most thorough accounting to date of Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cNo one should get away with murder,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter who they are, or how high their station in life.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news\n\nAD", "description": "The life and legacy of the slain Saudi journalist were commemorated by his fiancee, Arab political exiles and the owner and publisher of The Post.", "authors": ["Kareem Fahim", "Istanbul Bureau Chief Covering The Middle East"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/97uLxWpnNKD_o1G-BMUapNRY9Jk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6MYRHDHFDII6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg"}
