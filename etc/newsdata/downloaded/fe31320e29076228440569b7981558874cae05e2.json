We did not allow a lot at the back and we had our share of big chances which we did not use unfortunately,\u201d Kovac said\n\n\u201cWe will turn that corner at some point and score more goals from the many chances that we create.\u201d\n\nBorussia Dortmund are on 16 after settling their Ruhr valley derby with Schalke 04 with a goalless draw. Schalke are on 15.\n\nBayer Leverkusen missed their chance to move into the top three, drawing 2-2 with visitors Werder Bremen. Leverkusen, with only one win from the last four games, are also on 15.\n\nBorussia Moenchengladbach and VfL Wolfsburg, both on 16, could take over the lead with victory on Sunday over Eintracht Frankfurt and Augsburg respectively.", "description": "Robert Lewandowski scored for a league-record ninth consecutive Bundesliga match as Bayern Munich scraped past promoted Union Berlin 2-1 on Saturday to reclaim top spot in the league.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445451883&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q08P-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
