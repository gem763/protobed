The well is believed to go down as far as 180m in total.\n\nOfficials have sent down a camera that recorded Sujith breathing, and on Monday said the boy had passed out but was believed to be still alive. A continuous supply of oxygen is being pumped down into the well.\n\nHuge drilling equipment has been borrowed for the rescue from the Indian Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), which is digging a parallel, wider hole around 3m from the existing borehole.\n\nA first dig had to be abandoned after it hit a patch of dense rock. Rescuers hope to drill down 33m (110ft) and then send a rescue worker down the shaft to reach the boy.\n\nPrevious attempts to bring the boy out using a rope failed. Local media also reported that the boy\u2019s mother, Kalairani, was stitching a cloth bag for rescuers to use to bring Sujith out of the well.\n\nAnd a widely-shared video posted to social media shows Kalairani at the mouth of the borehole, calling out and telling him not to cry.\n\nThe efforts to rescue Sujith have gripped the country as it observes the long weekend for Diwali festivities, with many sharing messages of support and sympathy for the family on social media.\n\nCongress politician Sowmya Reddy wrote on Twitter: \u201cWhile most of us are celebrating #Deepavali a 2 year old baby, 100ft deep in almost 3 days with no food and water. #prayforsujith.\u201d\n\nThe Tamil actor Harish Kalyan wished his followers a happy Diwali before adding: \u201cHave a safe one. Lets take a min to pray for #Sujith.\"\n\nAnd the veteran actor and politician Ramanathan Sarathkumar wrote that \u201cthe entire state is praying for rescue of #Sujith\".", "description": "A major rescue operation is underway in India after a two-year-old boy fell into a deep, narrow well in a village in Tamil Nadu state.
