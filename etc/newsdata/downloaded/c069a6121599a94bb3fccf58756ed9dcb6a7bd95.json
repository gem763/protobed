He has always loved drinking whisky but was a wine collector first, he said in a statement through Sotheby\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI then found myself looking at unique bottles of Scotch, initially attracted by the beauty of the labels. So I started this collection,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving cherished these bottles, I am now ready to share them with collectors around the world.\u201d\n\nAlthough the collector acquired a range of whisky, he established several favorites along the way, including Bowmore, Highland Park, and especially The Macallan, which takes up 196 lots with a combined estimated value of \u00a32.2 million.\n\nThe Macallan Fine & Rare, 60 Years Old, 1926 Courtesy of Sotheby's\n\nAlso, leading the collection is The Macallan 1926 Fine & Rare, which is considered \u201cThe \u2018Holy Grail\u2019 of Whisky.\u201d It\u2019s estimated to sell for between \u00a3350,000 and \u00a3450,000.\n\nThe bottle was from Cask #263, which yielded only 40 bottles. From this cask, 12 bottles were labeled by Peter Blake, 12 by Valerio Adami, and two bottles were given private labels. The remaining 14 were bottled as the anchor for the Fine and Rare series, a series to which The Macallan is continuing to add releases annually.\n\nIn 2018, a bottle of The Macallan 1926 60-Year-Old Sir Peter Blake Label sold for $843,200 at Sotheby\u2019s New York, the highest price for any spirit sold at auction in North America, according to Sotheby\u2019s.\n\nThe sale also marks the first single-owner offering of spirits at Sotheby\u2019s, which in May added spirits as a separate category within its Fine Wine ecosystem and appointed London-based Jonny Fowle as its first-ever dedicated Spirits specialist.\n\nThe move came as the international auction house witnessed soaring demand for whisky and spirits in New York and Hong Kong auctions. Sotheby\u2019s sales of wine and spirits exceeded $100 million for the first time in 2018, and achieved a record-breaking $62 million in the first half of 2019, according to the company.\n\n\u201cThis groundbreaking sale reminds me of the first wine sales that Sotheby's held in New York in 1994 and Hong Kong in 2009 and we believe it will come to be viewed as a similarly historic moment in the spirits market,\u201d Jamie Ritchie, chairman of Sotheby\u2019s Wine, said in a statement.\n\nThe whisky sale will take place alongside RM Sotheby\u2019s exhibition and sale of collectible cars at Olympia, London.", "description": "The 467 bottles from an anonymous American collector are estimated in the region of $4.8 million", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-104920/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
