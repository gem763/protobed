But \u201cThe Last Stylebender\u201d won\u2019t be facing rival Paulo Costa.\n\nIn an interview with \u201cThe Schmo,\u201d White revealed Costa is out for the foreseeable future after surgery. The promotion has decided to go in a different direction while Costa heals up.\n\n\u201cHe had surgery on his bicep, so he\u2019s out for eight months,\u201d White said. \u201cBut we are working on something else with Israel right now.\u201d\n\nAdesanya and Costa have exchanged words on numerous occasions over the past few months. Immediately after he knocked out Robert Whittaker at UFC 243 in early October, Adesanya scaled the cage and flipped Costa dual middle fingers. A matchup between the two seemed inevitable.\n\nWith Costa on the shelf, could Adesanya\u2019s next outing be a superfight against UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones? No, said White, who was quick to shoot down any talk of the two champions squaring off next.\n\n\u201cHe just won the title,\u201d White said. \u201cTo do a Jones superfight right now doesn\u2019t make sense. There are guys in his own weight division that he could fight.\u201d\n\nJones and Adesanya have verbally sparred for months dating back long before Adesanya won the middleweight title. On Twitter and through interviews, both fighters have hurled their fair share of jabs. The constant back-and-forth has riled up a large number of MMA fans, who want to see that fight happen.", "description": "Dana White explained why middleweight champ Israel Adesanya won't be facing either of his biggest rivals for his next fight.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Simon Samano", "Farah Hannoun", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ufc-243_-israel-adesanya-post-fight-shrug.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
