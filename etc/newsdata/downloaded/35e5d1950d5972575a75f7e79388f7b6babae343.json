So far this season, they\u2019ve been buoyed by John Gibson, who has allowed one goal in each of the three games.\n\n\u201cGibby (Gibson) kept us in the game for two periods,\u201d Ritchie said. \u201cWe knew we had a better game in us, so we came out in the third, got a couple bounces and got the goals we needed.\u201d\n\nJakob Silfverberg had a goal and an assist and Rickard Rakell also scored for the Ducks. Gibson made 31 saves.\n\nAn apparent goal by the Red Wings\u2019 Dylan Larkin 8:06 into the third period was overturned because it was ruled the play went into the zone offside, and Ritchie scored on a rebound 1:04 later to give the Ducks a 2-1 lead. Silfverberg made it 3-1, beating Howard from the inside edge of the left circle off the rush, 47 seconds after that.\n\n\u201cIt was a little bit of a Muhammad Ali rope-a-dope - we were against the ropes early and then we were able to come back,\u201d Anaheim coach Dallas Eakins said.\n\nFilip Hronek scored for Detroit, which lost for the first time this season. Jimmy Howard stopped 26 shots.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things. It\u2019s a game of momentum and a game of inches and it just didn\u2019t go our way tonight,\u201d Howard said.\n\nRakell tied it at 1, 4:52 into the third, when Hampus Lindholm\u2019s shot bounced off Rakell, past Howard and into the net. Rakell\u2019s first goal followed a turnover by Detroit\u2019s Tyler Bertuzzi at his own blue line.\n\nHronek scored with 5 seconds left in the second period after hitting the goal post twice - one from each circle - during the previous 15 seconds or so.\n\nThe defenseman finally beat Gibson with a one-time slap shot from the left circle for his first goal of the season. It came with Howard out and Detroit playing 6-on-5, because a penalty was being called on the Ducks.\n\nLarkin also hit the goal post for the Red Wings a little less than five minutes into the middle period.\n\nNOTES: Detroit F Andreas Athanasiou made his season debut after missing the first two games with a lower-body injury. \u2026 Anaheim C Sam Steel, who is out with a middle-body injury, skated on Tuesday morning but did not participate in line drills.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nDucks: At Pittsburgh on Thursday.\n\nRed Wings: At Montreal on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Anaheim Ducks have ridden a hot goaltender to the franchise's third 3-0 start.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Paul Harris"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/ducks_red_wings_hockey_06652_c77-0-4297-2461_s1770x1032.jpg?55ff5786aac4dd1271cbcb47eb979cd2ba210dcb", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
