This is primarily due to the issue of enforcement in the event of loan default. Whereas secured loans collateralised by cryptocurrencies can be documented and enforced solely through smart contracts, it is a totally different proposition when it comes to unsecured loans.\n\n\u201cSince smart contracts are not recognised as a valid legal agreement in many countries, in order to provide unsecured loan products, we have to fall back to the traditional practice of documenting the loan transaction as a promissory note or lending agreement,\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly by doing this can the amount be collected legally by licensed debt collection agency from loan defaulters,\u201d said Mr. Rashdan Ibrahim, CEO of iP2P Global Ltd.\n\nTherefore under the iP2PGlobal platform all unsecured loan transacted through the platform will be documented under an e-loan agreement which have to electronically signed by the borrower and lenders.\n\nThe upcoming iP2PGlobal Platform will also be the first Shariah compliant peer-to-peer crypto lending platform, to achieve this the company has partnered with Salihin Shariah Advisory a registered Shariah Adviser with the Malaysian Securities Commission, and with AbleAce Raakin, an award-winning licensed commodity murabahah broker that will facilitates all unsecured lending transactions on the platform.\n\n\u201cThe positioning as a Shariah compliant platform is meant to appeal to the global Muslims population of more than 2 billion, and to the large number of unbanked adult population since coincidentally a large number of these unbanked population are from Muslim countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Nigeria, or countries with large Muslim minorities such as China and India,\u201d\n\n\u201cAs has been demonstrated in China and Indonesia, countries with large unbanked population is ripe for fintech and even cryptocurrency businesses to grow and prosper, contrary to conventional beliefs these unbanked population are actually more receptive to new technology and new medium of exchange,\u201d according to Rashdan.\n\nAll the lending and borrowing activities on the iP2PGlobal Platform will be transacted in stablecoins. The management has identified TUSD and PAXOS as the two stablecoins that will be used as the platform\u2019s medium of exchange.\n\n\u201cThe use of stablecoins as our platform\u2019s medium of exchange is logical since both lenders and borrowers will not be affected by crypto price volatility, it is also inline with our unsecured crypto loan products which actually targets and encourage borrowers to use their loan proceeds for real world uses as compared to usage just in the crypto world.\u201d\n\nTHE TWQ TOKEN\n\nThe TWQ Token is the platform\u2019s native token, borrowers will have to stake a certain amount of TWQ Tokens when applying for personal financing on the iP2PGlobal platform. The TWQ token is reusable and will be returned to the borrower on successful loan repayment.\n\nThe TWQ Token is a pure utility token and does or will not provide any other rights and functions to its holders.\n\nRashdan said the amount of TWQ Token to be staked is based on a fixed percentage on the loan amount applied.\n\n\u201cTherefore if the price of TWQ token increases a smaller amount of tokens are require to be staked, and vice versa if the price of TWQ token decreases. If the loan auction is not successful the staked TWQ token will also be returned to the loan applicant,\u201d he said.\n\nINITIAL EXCHANGE OFFERING ON EXMARKETS\n\niP2PGlobal\u2019s IEO on Exmarkets starts on November 18th and will consist of three separate rounds, each offering a different price and bonus structure. TWQ tokens can be subscribed by using Ethereum or Bitcoin.\n\nRound I: November 18th \u2013 24th | TWQ Price: $0.10 | 20% bonus on purchases;\n\nRound II: November 30th \u2013 December 6th | TWQ Price: $0.10 | 10% bonus on purchases;\n\nRound III: December 12th \u2013 18th | TWQ Price: $0.10 | 5% bonus on purchases;\n\n\u201cOne of the main reason why we chose Exmarkets was it\u2019s past records in undertaking numerous and diverse IEO projects. We were also attracted to Exmarkets geographical reach with users in Europe, Middle East and South Asia, which is in line with our target markets.\u201d commented Rashdan.\n\nFor more information on TWQ Token\u2019s IEO, visit https://exmarkets.com/launchpad/twq-btc\n\nABOUT IP2P GLOBAL LTD\n\niP2P Global Ltd is a fintech-blockchain company that was first established in 2015.
