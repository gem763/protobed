Joe Marler (England) Not so long ago the loosehead was in international retirement, yet now he finds himself as one of just five players to have started all three of England\u2019s pool games. Marler stood up to take on responsibility in the absence of first-choice Mako Vunipola, and ensured that his absence did not become a weakness. AFP via Getty Images 3/16 2. Shota Horie (Japan) Arguably the player of the pool stage. Horie\u2019s familiar locks have made him famous for more than just his rugby skills, but it is what he is doing on the field that he deserves praise for. Standout performances against Ireland and Scotland tell you all you need to know about his form so far. Getty Images 4/16 3. Tadhg Furlong (Ireland) Furlong was outstanding against Samoa and has provided strong consistency across the pool stage to help Ireland get back on their feet. With most tighthead props being rotated game by game, it makes selection rather tricky to look for standout moments, but Furlong\u2019s two crunching runs in his most recent outing see him stand out from the rest.

His defensive effort has been supreme with the numbers to back it up, while he is also a key reason why Japan now have a strong set-piece. AFP/Getty Images 6/16 5.

Slow him down and teams will work out how to beat Japan, but so far no one has managed to do that and Nagare has punished them for it. AP 11/16 10. George Ford (England) A bright light in what has not been a shimmering campaign so far for England, but the way he has surged back into the mix after losing his place to Owen Farrell last year has been impressive.

Kotaro Matsushima (Japan) Five-try Kotro leads the way at the Rugby World Cup, with only Wales\u2019s Josh Adams able to match his haul at the tournament so far. Matsushima brings a huge work rate to the back-field and has an incredible ability to bounce off much bigger tacklers than he is, which says a lot about his skills and strength in the tackle.

AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cHe was just doing what he thought was right at the time, but he apologised the day after and I saw him in Fiji two or three weeks after the tour as well. He\u2019s a very nice bloke, very down to earth and I don\u2019t hold any type of grudge against him at all. It\u2019s rugby at the end of the day.\n\n\u201cIt was completely random. Everyone was cracking up in the hotel, but we were just sat there as if nothing had happened, to be fair. I know it was a massive swing of momentum in terms of the Test and the impact it had, but I didn\u2019t see it as the big deal that was made out \u2013 that there was a massive drama and we were going to hate each other for the rest of our lives, or anything like that.\n\n\u201cWe just talked about all kinds of stuff; about rugby and about his family and stuff like that. It was just a general conversation, we didn\u2019t talk about the tackle!\u201d\n\nThe victory in the second Test in Wellington not only kept the series alive for the Lions, but it proved to every man on the field that the All Blacks could be beaten.\n\nBut in Watson\u2019s head, the much-discussed aura that surrounds the All Blacks never really applied.\n\n\u201cI was never too fazed by the whole mystique of the All Blacks. I respect the prolonged success they\u2019ve had as a team, but the whole aura that surrounds them and the invincible stuff \u2013 I never bought into that. They are rugby players and we\u2019re rugby players. We work very hard and they work very hard. They are definitely beatable.\n\nEven before that tour I respected how successful the All Blacks had been for a long time, but they\u2019re humans at the end of the day. There will be 23 of them and 23 of us on Saturday and they\u2019re human beings and rugby players just like us. We\u2019ve just got to do what we do.\u201d\n\nWatson was perhaps at the peak of his form going into the Lions tour, which resulted in Warren Gatland handing him a starting jersey for all three Tests against the All Blacks. His only try of the tour would come in the very first match, against the New Zealand Provincial Barbarians, in what should have been a walkover victory for the Lions against their weakest opposition of the lot.\n\nBut coming just a few days after their arrival, the Lions were nearly caught cold and it took Watson\u2019s try to bail them out with a 13-7 win against a side that contained a few hidden gems. One of those talented young players was Sevu Reece, the wing who now finds himself a key part of the All Blacks team, and Watson remembers seeing his raw talent immediately.\n\n\u201cSevu Reece was the first person I played against on that New Zealand tour,\u201d recalled Watson. \u201cHe played for the Provincial Barbarians and I remember thinking he was a class player. He had good feet and was very strong.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely a good player and it\u2019s the same with George Bridge. You saw those tries he scored against Tonga. Give either of those two too much space and they can cause difficulties for you. We\u2019ll have to be defensively aware of the threats they pose.\u201d", "description": "Anthony Watson holds no grudges at all towards New Zealand\u00a0centre Sonny Bill Williams for smashing him in the face with his shoulder two years ago, after the Kiwi\u00a0cleared the air in a fluke encounter in Fiji.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/22/23/gettyimages-805194478.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
