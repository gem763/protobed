People who abused this situation are a**holes.\"\n\nLeotta said: \"I really appreciated Mario Balotelli's gesture and support.\n\n\"I felt I was not alone on that occasion and realised that the problem is much more common than I've ever expected.\"", "description": "Diletta Leotta insists chants urging her to take her top off were 'just a joke'", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Mirror Digital", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20394130.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Diletta-Leotta-Instagram-pic.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
