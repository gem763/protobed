DFJ is managed by Wisdomtree. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the WisdomTree Japan SmallCap Dividend Index.\n\nWisdomTree Japan SmallCap Dividend Index measures the performance of dividend-paying small capitalization companies in Japan. After the 300 largest companies have been removed from the WisdomTree Japan Dividend Index, the remaining companies are chosen for inclusion in the Index. Companies are weighted in the Index based on annual cash dividends paid.\n\nCost & Other Expenses\n\nWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.\n\nAnnual operating expenses for DFJ are 0.58%, which makes it one of the more expensive products in the space.\n\nDFJ's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.99%.\n\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\n\nIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.\n\nWhen you look at individual holdings, Haseko Corp accounts for about 1.23% of the fund's total assets, followed by Matsui Securities Co Ltd and Aozora Bank Ltd.\n\nIts top 10 holdings account for approximately 7.36% of DFJ's total assets under management.\n\nPerformance and Risk\n\nYear-to-date, the WisdomTree Japan SmallCap Dividend Fund return is roughly 8.32% so far, and is down about -8.41% over the last 12 months (as of 09/23/2019). DFJ has traded between $60.90 and $78.29 in this past 52-week period.\n\nThe fund has a beta of 0.68 and standard deviation of 13.52% for the trailing three-year period, which makes DFJ a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 822 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\n\nAlternatives\n\nWisdomTree Japan SmallCap Dividend Fund is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Asia-Pacific (Developed) ETFs segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.\n\nJPMorgan BetaBuilders Japan ETF (BBJP) tracks MORNINGSTAR JAPAN TRGT MRKT EXPOSURE ID and the iShares MSCI Japan ETF (EWJ) tracks MSCI Japan Index. JPMorgan BetaBuilders Japan ETF has $4.15 B in assets, iShares MSCI Japan ETF has $11.75 B. BBJP has an expense ratio of 0.19% and EWJ charges 0.47%.\n\nInvestors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Asia-Pacific (Developed) ETFs.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
