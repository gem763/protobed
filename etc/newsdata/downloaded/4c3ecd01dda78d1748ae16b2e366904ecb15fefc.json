But so far, Biden has faced little criticism over his shift on abortion funding relative to other aspects of his record, and polling shows that he remains Catholic Democrats\u2019 overwhelming favorite in the presidential field.\n\nSince the days of John F. Kennedy, Catholic Democrats have wrestled to reconcile their church\u2019s teachings with their party\u2019s politics. That tension has been especially acute when it comes to abortion, with some bishops threatening to deny communion to then-Sen. John Kerry over his support for abortion rights during his 2004 presidential bid. But the church has faced significant upheaval in the 15 years since then, raising questions about whether Biden\u2019s leftward step on abortion is a liability with some voters of faith \u2014 or a more minor hurdle at a time when Catholics, like the electorate nationwide, are becoming more politically polarized in the age of President Donald Trump.\n\nSteven Krueger, president of the nonprofit Catholic Democrats, warned that \u201cthe far left wing of the party has had influence on a number of issues,\u201d including abortion, \u201cthat is not going to serve candidates well once they\u2019re in the general election.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to kind of tack back to the middle once you take a stand on something as black and white as\u201d the restrictions on federal abortion funding that Biden abruptly came out against in June, Krueger added.\n\nBiden called for ending those four-decade-old limits on government health care spending on abortion, often referred to as the Hyde Amendment, under heavy fire from his Democratic rivals. He made the move with a subtle nod to the devout Catholicism that had initially informed his pursuit of a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d on the matter.\n\n\u201cJust as I\u2019ve never attempted to impose my views on anyone else as to when life begins, I have never attempted to impose my view on who should pay for it,\u201d Biden said as he shifted from supporter to opponent of Hyde, which bars federal funds from use on abortion services except for cases of rape, incest, or risk to a woman\u2019s life.\n\nBiden has demonstrated a deep public connection to his faith, dating to the earliest days of his political career. He regularly attends Mass, has met with both Pope Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict, and credited Catholicism with helping him heal after his son Beau\u2019s death in 2015.\n\nBiden went deeper on the connection between his Catholicism and his stance on abortion during a recent campaign stop at Limestone College in South Carolina, peppering his theological aside with some Latin references.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m prepared to accept for me, personally, doctrine of my church\u201d about when life begins, Biden said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not prepared to impose that on every other person.\u201d\n\nAbortion is not the only issue on which Biden has split from his church\u2019s official stance. He is a longtime backer of LGBTQ rights, including same-sex marriage. And the same phrase he used to describe his new opposition to Hyde \u2014 \u201ccircumstances have changed\u201d \u2014 could also apply to Catholic voters heading into 2020.\n\nAccording to AP VoteCast, which surveyed voters in the 2018 midterm elections, a majority of Catholics \u2014 57% \u2014 said abortion should be legal in most or all cases, while Protestants and other Christians were about evenly divided.\n\nYet there\u2019s significant regional variation in views on abortion. That variability is notable among Catholic voters in the Midwest, where Biden is campaigning as a potential Democratic nominee who\u2019s uniquely positioned to win back the less liberal working-class voters Trump appealed to in 2016.\n\nIn the East, West and South, Catholic voters were nearly as likely as voters in those regions overall to believe abortion should usually or always be legal. But Midwestern Catholics, whom Democrats need to perform well with to stay competitive in a general election, were significantly less likely than regional voters overall to hold those more permissive views on abortion, 47% versus 58%.\n\nThe truest test of Biden\u2019s ability to stay dominant with Catholic voters isn\u2019t likely to come unless he makes it to a general election against Trump. If that happens, conservatives are likely to try to use the Democrat\u2019s shift on abortion against him.\n\nAnd to be sure, leaders of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops remain stalwart supporters of the restriction on federal funding of abortions, which is a fixture in the law with bipartisan backing.\n\n\u201cWhether you like it or not, the consensus in America is abortion is legal and available, and no one has to pay for anyone else\u2019s abortion or participate in anyone else\u2019s abortion,\u201d John Carr, a former longtime adviser to the bishops, said in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cWhen Republicans go after the first, I think they scare people,\u201d added Carr, founder of Georgetown University\u2019s Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life. \u201cWhen Democrats go after the second, which is \u2018you\u2019re going to have to pay for or maybe participate in an abortion,\u2019 they scare off other people.\u201d\n\nBut as Trump\u2019s immigration policy stokes religious progressives\u2019 interest in applying a \u201cpro-life\u201d ethos to other issues, abortion may not hold as much sway over Catholic voters in 2020 as it did in previous elections.\n\nSister Simone Campbell, executive director of the NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, lamented that her faith\u2019s ethic of protecting life is often \u201creduced\u201d to the question of whether to \u201ccriminalize abortion.\u201d\n\nSister Carol Keehan, who recently retired as head of the Catholic Health Association, described herself as \u201cextraordinarily pro-life\u201d and supportive of the Hyde Amendment, but she also contended that Biden is \u201cpro-life\u201d on many fronts reflected in other policy decisions.\n\nAs religious activists on the left urge voters of faith to consider a more expansive definition of \u201cpro-life,\u201d Trump himself may hold the key to Biden escaping significant peril with Catholic Democrats. A Quinnipiac University poll released in May found 55% of Catholic voters saying they would definitely not support Trump\u2019s reelection, versus 41% of Protestants and 70% of those with no religious affiliation.\n\n\u201cTo the degree Vice President Biden may have given pause to persuadable Catholic voters\u201d with his shift on abortion, Krueger said, \u201cthere remains a countervailing imperative for Catholics to replace our nation\u2019s 45th president.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Polling Editor Emily Swanson in Washington and writer Bill Barrow in Gaffney, South Carolina, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through the Religion News Foundation.
