But he warned that the military action would not lead to a \"good result\", saying a political solution was the only way to end the Syrian conflict.\n\n- 'Risk of resurgent IS' -\n\nTurkey \"is willingly risking further destabilising the region and a resurgence of IS\" (Islamic State) by attacking northeastern Syria, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said.\n\n\"Syria needs stability and a political process... however, the Turkish offensive now threatens to cause a new humanitarian disaster,\" Maas said in a statement, adding that Berlin would \"urge Turkey to end its offensive and to pursue its security interests peacefully\".\n\n- 'Must stop' -\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the offensive \"must stop\".\n\n\"It calls into question the security and humanitarian efforts of the coalition against Daesh and risks undermining Europeans' security,\" he said in a tweet, using the Arabic name for the Islamic State (IS) group.\n\nFrench European Affairs Minister Amelie de Montchalin earlier said France, Germany and Britain were working on a joint declaration \"which will be extremely clear on the fact that we very strongly condemn\" the Turkish campaign.\n\n- 'Risks destabilising the region' -\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab expressed \"serious concerns about the unilateral military action that Turkey has taken\".\n\nThe action \"risks destabilising the region, exacerbating humanitarian suffering, and undermining the progress made against Daesh which should be our collective focus,\" he added in a statement.\n\n- Ambassador summoned -\n\nDutch foreign minister Stef Blok said he had summoned Turkey's ambassador to condemn the assault.\n\n\"I call on Turkey not to follow the path it has chosen,\" Blok, whose country is a member of the coalition against the Islamic State, said on Twitter.\n\n\"No one can benefit from the potentially terrible humanitarian consequences. The operation can trigger new refugee flows and harm the fight against IS and stability in the region.\"\n\n- Already struggling population -\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said it was \"deeply concerned that any escalation in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s north-east could harm an already struggling population,\" stressing that \"the humanitarian space\" needs to be preserved\".", "description": "World governments reacted with concern Wednesday after Turkey launched a military offensive on Kurdish forces in northern Syria, while the UN Security Council plans to hold an emergency meeting to discuss the assault.
