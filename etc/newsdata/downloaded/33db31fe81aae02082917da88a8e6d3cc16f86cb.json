The list of missing stands at an alarming 1,300 people and the death toll at 50. But officials caution the list is preliminary and many people could just be unable to connect with loved ones.\n\nThe storm originally threatened to exacerbate the nation's problems, but conditions appeared to normalize Saturday afternoon.\n\nAt 5 p.m. EDT, the US National Hurricane Center said Humberto was located about 70 miles (113 kilometers) north of Great Abaco Island and was moving 7 mph (11 kph) north-northwest with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (80 kph). The Bahamian government discontinued a tropical storm warning.\n\nWeather forecasters say Humberto will likely become a hurricane by Sunday night as it moves away from the Bahamas and the US coast, but won't threaten land by the time it intensifies to that strength. Its swells could still affect the coasts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina later this weekend and early next week.\n\nRead more: The storm has moved on, but Alabamans are still divided over Trump's fake Hurricane Dorian warning\n\nUnder a bright sun in the Grand Bahama, 40-year-old maintenance man Dexter Wilson was helping a friend put a blue tarp on a damaged roof. He said he was worried about his brother in Abaco given the tropical storm.\n\n\"He's still there. I don't know why,\" he said.\n\nThe hurricane center said most of Humberto's heavy squalls were occurring north and east of the center of the storm, which passed just east of Abaco. However, government officials in the Bahamas took no chances and urged people in damaged homes to seek shelter as they announced that aid efforts would be temporarily affected.\n\nA view of devastated houses after Hurricane Dorian hit the Abaco Islands in Spring City, Bahamas, on September 11, 2019.

I think it's Category Hell,\" the UN secretary-general said after his visit.\n\nHe said storms powered by climate change had grown more intense, and he implored the international community to learn from the example of Abaco and Grand Bahama and provide support.\n\n\"We have always had many hurricanes, but now they are more intense, and they are more frequent,\" he said.", "description": "The storm originally threatened to exacerbate the nation's problems, but conditions appeared to normalize Saturday afternoon.", "authors": ["D\u00e1nica Coto", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7da6ca21214c3b8366baef-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
