One member called a police officer a \u201cpig\u201d and another told a cop to \u201cshut the f--- up.\u201d\n\nGLOBAL CLIMATE STRIKE KICKS OFF WITH THOUSANDS SKIPPING SCHOOL OR WORK FOR DEMONSTRATIONS ACROSS THE WORLD\n\nOn Friday, hundreds of thousands protested climate change around the world. Australia, with more than 300,000 protesters taking to the streets around the country, saw its largest demonstration since the start of the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nHowever, in Portland, a faction of masked Antifa militants dressed in black harassed police officers.\n\nNgo said that while most climate protests around the world were peaceful, a group of militants \u201ccommandeered\u201d part of the demonstrations and replaced the chant about the climate to \u201cexpletives\u201d against the police.\n\nTEEN CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIVIST CALLS AOC AN 'ICON,' TELLS CONGRESS URGENT ACTION NEEDED\n\n\u201cThere were several arrests throughout the day,\u201d he said. He also said one of the suspects was found to be carrying weapons such as a hammer, brass knuckles, and a switch-blade.\n\nNgo added that after the climate rally ended, the group of \"masked militants\" went to a local Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility and threw projectiles at officers there. He said the video he shot showed the protesters running from police.\n\nHost Brian Kilmeade asked Ngo about the typical age of an Antifa member at the demonstrations.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s concerning about this to me is that this movement is able to recruit younger and younger people. I mean, any of these masked people are really children,\u201d Ngo said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe went on to say, \u201cYou see how they\u2019ve bought in to this narrative that the police are evil and they have no hesitation in not just showing disrespect to law enforcement, but hatred and trying to actively get in the way of the arrests.\"\n\nFox News' Lucia I.
