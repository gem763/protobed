They voted to seize control of the parliamentary agenda on Wednesday.\n\nThey plan to pass a law to force Mr Johnson to delay Brexit until 31 January unless MPs approve a new deal.\n\nHowever Mr Johnson won't ask the EU for more time. He said the government would instead seek an early election.\n\nBut it's unclear if two-thirds of MPs will agree, as required.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nThe British public voted to leave the EU well over three years ago.\n\nIn order to do that, the last prime minister, Theresa May, negotiated a deal with the EU covering the terms on which the \"divorce\" would happen. Break-up day was meant to be 29 March 2019.\n\nThen, as now, parliament disagreed with the government. Mrs May couldn't get her deal through and was forced to ask for Brexit to be delayed. Eventually she stepped down.\n\nBoris Johnson was voted in as the new leader by members of the Conservative Party and became prime minister in late July.\n\nHe vowed to take Britain out of the EU by the new deadline of 31 October, \"no ifs or buts\".\n\nBut like her, he now finds himself defeated in Parliament, including by some of his fellow Conservative politicians.\n\nWhy can't he do what he wants?\n\nIt's all about numbers. Boris Johnson, on Tuesday morning, had a working majority in parliament of one.\n\nBy late afternoon this razor-thin majority vanished when a Conservative MP defected to the pro-EU Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe arithmetic meant it was always going to be hard for the government to defeat a motion supported by a large group of MPs from many parties opposed to a no-deal Brexit.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The moment Tory MP Phillip Lee defects to Lib Dems\n\nA major headache for Mr Johnson was that a group of his own MPs had made clear they were likely to rebel and vote for the motion.\n\nThis \"rebel alliance\", which in the end numbered 21 lawmakers, agrees with a cross-section of MPs that a no-deal Brexit would cause economic chaos.\n\nSo they helped to take the parliamentary agenda out of the government's hands - the first step in passing a law to block no-deal.\n\nSuch are the bitter divisions in the Conservative Party that they did this despite being warned they would be effectively kicked out of the party.\n\nIt's worth noting that Nicholas Soames - the grandson of Boris Johnson's political hero Winston Churchill - is among them.\n\nI thought time was tight?\n\nIt is. Big Ben is undergoing repairs but the minutes are still ticking away in Westminster.\n\nThis is because of Mr Johnson's decision to ask the Queen to suspend parliament from sometime next week - squeezing the amount of time that MPs have to avert no-deal.\n\nThey will kick off the process on Wednesday by introducing legislation that could become law next week if it passes all hurdles.\n\nIf it does, this would tie Mr Johnson's hands and compel the government ask for another Brexit delay.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Enter the word or phrase you are looking for Search\n\nSo where does the election come in?\n\nMr Johnson has said there is no way he will ask the EU for another Brexit delay.\n\nHe has also said many times that by taking no-deal off the table, MPs will torpedo the UK's negotiations with the EU.\n\nAfter the government lost the vote, he said he was ready to call for an October election.\n\nWhy would Boris Johnson do this? We talked about numbers. Mr Johnson will hope his party could win a new majority in parliament that would make his Brexit plans much easier. Polls currently put the Conservatives at a healthy lead over Labour.\n\nBut many Conservatives fear that any election in an unpredictable political environment risks a hard-left government led by Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party.\n\nSome Westminster watchers believe that Mr Johnson actually doesn't want an early election at all. Two-thirds of MPs would need to vote for one and while Labour has long called for an election, Mr Corbyn said it would only back one once a no-deal Brexit is ruled out in law.\n\nSome MPs are worried Mr Johnson could call an election and later change the date to after 31 October, the current Brexit deadline.\n\nIf that happened he could tell voters he achieved Brexit, no ifs or buts.", "description": "Boris Johnson's Brexit plans have been dealt a major blow.
