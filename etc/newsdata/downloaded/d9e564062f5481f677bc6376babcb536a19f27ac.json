It seems like he has performed magic, but he has really only applied logic.\n\nThe word used most to describe Erasmus by those that work, or have worked, with him is \u201cmeticulous\u201d. When he was asked to coach the Boks in addition to his role as director of rugby at the SA Rugby Union, Erasmus already had a clear vision for the country\u2019s flagship team.\n\nWith only 19 Tests before their opening game against the All Blacks in Yokohama on 21 September, Erasmus did not waste a minute.\n\nHe started by appointing a captain who would rally the nation, and the team, behind him. In one of those quirks of timing, Siya Kolisi had emerged as a strong leader of the Stormers and as a figure who could unite the country around the Springboks.\n\nErasmus recognised this, and his decision to appoint Kolisi as the first black Test captain has been a brilliant one. Kolisi in turn, has more than met the challenge of one of the toughest jobs in sport to become an iconic leader.\n\nErasmus also needed to build depth. He said the Boks would have to take some losses along the way to do it. They did, but there was always a bigger plan.\n\nErasmus clarified tactics, prioritised set piece and defence and helped develop Faf de Klerk into a world-class scrum-half, which was a vital piece of the missing puzzle.\n\nThe aggressive defensive system the Boks employ, by shutting space from the outside in, is risky and took time to mature. But the recent signs are that the team is now comfortable with it. The scrum has been a huge area of strength and the Bok lineout is also imperious and from these platforms they build the foundation for wins.\n\nUnder the circumstances despite the tight timeframe, Erasmus has got the Boks to Japan in magnificent form and full of confidence. No one could ask for more.\n\n\u2022 Craig Ray is a Cape Town-based sports writer and author", "description": "The Springboks go into the tournament as the form team on the planet thanks to Rassie Erasmus\u2019s superb stewardship", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42751fe086734dd7202324231998b7515e852f3b/0_0_500_300/master/500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6d7c84dcc9df735a926135e9131edaff", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
