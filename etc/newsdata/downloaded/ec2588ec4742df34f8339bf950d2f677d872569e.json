We have to try and keep that up for 90 minutes.\u201d\n\nREAL RELIEVED\n\nThe visitors made it a nervous finale for the home fans with 15 minutes to go thanks to a near-post header from Melero and twice came close to levelling in stoppage time.\n\nReal goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was forced to turn away a header from Ruben Vezo, while Levante\u2019s talisman Jose Luis Morales tried to catch the Belgian out moments later by shooting for the near post instead of crossing but narrowly missed.\n\n\u201cWe had Madrid begging for the fulltime whistle,\u201d said Levante coach Paco Lopez.\n\nZidane\u2019s side had drawn their last two games against Real Valladolid and Villarreal and were grateful to scrape a victory.\n\nCourtois criticised his side for switching off after the break following their electric start.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\n\u201cIf we had continued to play in the same way as in the first half we would have won 5-0 or 6-0,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cWe played the best 45 minutes of the season but that\u2019s football, Levante changed their system and at times we were sloppy with our passing.\u201d\n\n($1 = 0.9031 euros)", "description": "Real Madrid produced a rampant first-half display to beat Levante 3-2 in La Liga on Saturday with goals from Karim Benzema and Casemiro but dropped off after Eden Hazard came on to make his debut and were left clinging on for the three points.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429809098&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D0GI", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
