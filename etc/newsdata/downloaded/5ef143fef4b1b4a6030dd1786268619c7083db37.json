Kom has said she would follow BFI instructions.\n\n\"I have been inspired by Mary Kom since I was a teenager,\" Zareen wrote in her letter to the minister.\n\n\"The best way I can do justice to this inspiration was to strive to be as great a boxer as her...\n\n\"I have been reliably informed that the rule is now being changed again to accommodate my senior Mary Kom as the Indian candidate without a trial.\"\n\nHer cause has received support from other athletes, including shooter Abhinav Bindra, India's only individual Olympic gold medallist, who said Kom's past achievements should not grant her favourable treatment.\n\n\"While I have all the respect for Mary Kom...In sport, yesterday NEVER counts,\" Bindra tweeted.\n\nBFI secretary general Jay Kowli, who was in Dubai, said he could not comment without consulting other officials while selection committee chief Rajesh Bhandari was not available to comment when contacted by Reuters.\n\nSports Minister Rijiju, however, has ruled out any intervention citing the BFI's autonomy under the Olympic charter.\n\n\"I'll surely convey to Boxing Federation to take the best decision keeping in mind the best interest of the nation, sports & athletes,\" he tweeted on Friday.\n\nZareen thanked the minister and said she hoped for an end to \"favouritism and nepotism\".
