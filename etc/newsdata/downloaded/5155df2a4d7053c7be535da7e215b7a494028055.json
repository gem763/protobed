Treasury yields and dollar/yen look to be too high and are likely to start drifting lower.\"\n\nThe dollar rose to 108.265 yen, the highest since Aug. 1.\n\nThe greenback was up 1.2% versus the yen this week, on course for its best weekly performance since November 2018.\n\nThe dollar has also drawn support from a spike in U.S. Treasury yields, with the benchmark 10-year yield at a five-week high.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would not rule out an interim trade pact with China.\n\nThe two sides are preparing for new rounds of talks aimed at curbing their trade war, which has dragged on for more than a year, roiling financial markets and threatening to push other economies into recession.\n\nThe yen, widely considered a safe-haven currency, tends to rise during times of heightened economic or market stress and vice versa.\n\nChina's financial markets were closed for a public holiday on Friday. In offshore trade, the yuan rose 0.3% versus the dollar to 7.0459, the strongest since Aug. 19.\n\nSterling was up 0.3% on the dollar this week, on course for its second week of gains after the British Parliament moved to block a so-called no-deal exit from the European Union.\n\nThe pound remains vulnerable, however, given the continuing uncertainty over how lawmakers will decide the terms of the UK's divorce from the EU.\n\nThe euro held steady at $1.1068, on course for its second weekly gain against the dollar.\n\nThe single currency initially tumbled on Thursday after the ECB cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points to a record low of minus 0.5% and said it would restart bond purchases at a rate of 20 billion euros a month from Nov. 1.\n\nThe rate cut was widely expected, but the revived bond purchases were a surprise. Still, the euro managed to claw back losses as the ECB's comprehensive stimulus package now shifts the spotlight to the Fed and BOJ policy meetings next week.\n\nFinancial markets have fully priced in a rate cut at the Fed's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting. Most economists expect additional monetary policy easing in October and December.\n\nThe Fed cut rates in July for the first time since 2008.\n\nTrump has publicly criticized the Fed for not cutting rates more aggressively, but positive economic data has cast some doubt on the need for extensive easing.\n\nThe BOJ is also brainstorming ways to deepen negative interest rates at minimal cost to commercial banks, as it considers adopting it as a main policy response to a slowing economy, sources familiar with the bank's thinking said.\n\nThe BOJ's next policy decision is due Sept. 19.", "description": "The yen was pinned near a six-week low versus the dollar on Friday as signs the United States and China were narrowing their differences over trade ahead of key talks decreased demand for safe haven assets.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104235853-GettyImages-119586743.jpg?v=1507164286", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
