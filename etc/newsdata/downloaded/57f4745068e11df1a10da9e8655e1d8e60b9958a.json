And since AOC has become not only the face of socialism but the Democratic Party itself, she was \u2018the star.\u2019\n\nFor most of the day, the Left has been demanding people #BoycottABC and of course, AOC herself accused the group of being racist and pandering to white supremacists (because you know, white supremacists HATE socialism), so we\u2019re not surprised Ilhan Omar tweeted about it as well.\n\nThis is horrifying to watch. When will the Republicans learn how to offer ideas and solutions without stroking fear and inciting violence? Enough is enough. They need to pull this garbage off the air and issue an apology to @AOC. https://t.co/pxSW0iUgSR \u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) September 13, 2019\n\nThinking she meant \u2018stoking fear,\u2019 not stroking fear.\n\nBut we digress.\n\nAnd please, Republicans aren\u2019t the ones telling people the world is going to end in 10 years or 18 months or whatever crazy timeframe they\u2019re pushing now.\n\nI'm old enough to remember when the Left had an ad with a Paul Ryan lookalike pushing an old lady off a cliff. But yeah, this is horrifying. \u2014 Jules of Denial (@Coolish_Breeze) September 13, 2019\n\nWho flew the planes into the twin towers? \u2014 \ud83c\udd57\ud83c\udd50\ud83c\udd61\ud83c\udd53\ud83c\udd5a\ud83c\udd5d\ud83c\udd5e\ud83c\udd67 (@allenknox) September 13, 2019\n\nSome people did something.\n\nNo it's not.

Hopefully you learn from the video. \u2014 Sandpit (@rev_entertain) September 13, 2019\n\nYes, socialism is horrible to watch\u2026https://t.co/NYKuJpOfRr \u2014 angry libertarian NPC (@mattatat138) September 13, 2019\n\nIt is horrifying.
