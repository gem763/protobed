By Bloomberg", "language": "en", "text": "\u00a9 Reuters. Trump \u2018Can\u2019t Win Them All.\u2019 Neither Can Powell.\n\n(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Even if you\u2019re not the biggest fan of the Federal Reserve, you have to feel a little sorry for Chair Jerome Powell. As everyone involved in financial markets is acutely aware, he and the central bank have been a favorite target of President Donald Trump\u2019s ire for months now.\n\nAnd yet, the latest Twitter jab on Friday, ahead of the August jobs report and Powell\u2019s remarks on the economy in Zurich, seemed especially demeaning:\n\nThe answer, of course, is that Trump \u201cfound\u201d Powell already among the Fed\u2019s board of governors when he was making his pick in late 2017. He won out over other candidates that the president reportedly spoke with about the position, including incumbent Janet Yellen, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh and former National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn. At the time, Powell was seen as largely following Yellen\u2019s blueprint of steady, gradual interest-rate increases until the fed funds rate returned to a more neutral level. He delivered on that promise through the end of 2018.\n\nThe past few months have been notably more difficult. In particular, two voters on the Federal Open Market Committee dissented in July when the central bank cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. Powell himself sounded somewhat conflicted during a much-anticipated speech last month in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where he admitted that the Fed doesn\u2019t really have a playbook for dealing with a prolonged, damaging international trade war.\n\nPowell spoke on Friday in Zurich and largely stuck to script, staying fairly upbeat on the economy overall while being careful not to criticize trade policy. The labor market is in \u201cquite a strong position,\u201d he said, and the jobs report released four hours earlier \u201cis very much consistent with that story.\u201d He added that \u201cthe outlook is still a favorable one,\u201d arguing that was due in part to the Fed\u2019s pivot starting at the beginning of this year.\n\nMarkets didn\u2019t react too much to that. What was somewhat novel, however, was Powell\u2019s discussion of the inner workings of the FOMC and how he leads the central bank based on his experience:\n\n\u201cTo a large extent, it\u2019s a policy of putting together a consensus. My nature is to want to incorporate people\u2019s thinking and develop a consensus. Sometimes it\u2019s me convincing, sometimes it\u2019s me trying to move people into a group. Collective decision making can work, and in our case, I think it has worked well\u2026\n\nSometimes it\u2019s easy to get unanimity on things when the path is clear. Other times it\u2019s murky out there and there\u2019s a range of views. This is one of those times. Trade policy uncertainty is not something that central banks have a lot of practice in dealing with. We\u2019re trying to look through short-run developments and try to assess what the implications for the outlook in the medium and longer term will be of those developments.\n\nWe\u2019re clearly at a time where there are a range of views. I do think that\u2019s a very healthy thing. We will of course reach a decision, I expect we will have a strong support for the decision we make, as we did in July.\u201d\n\nWith the Fed now headed into its self-imposed blackout period, it seems doubtful that Powell will form a unified front among FOMC voting members at its Sept. 17-18 meeting.\n\nBoston Fed President Eric Rosengren, one of the voters who sided against lowering interest rates in July, reiterated on Sept. 3 that he sees no need for immediate action if the economic data stay on track: \u201cIt is clearly reasonable to make the assessment that risks are elevated. Should those risks become a reality, the appropriate monetary policy would be to ease aggressively. However, to date, these elevated risks have not become reality, at least for the U.S. economy.\u201d\n\nNo economic reports since then are likely to have changed his mind. The Labor Department report on Friday showed total nonfarm payrolls climbed by a below-forecast 130,000, but average hourly earnings beat estimates by rising 3.2% from a year earlier, remaining close to the highest level in a decade. It was more of a mixed bag then the unambiguously strong data from Thursday, which flipped Citigroup Inc (NYSE: ).\u2019s U.S. Economic Surprise Index to positive for the first time since February and caused two-year Treasury yields to rise as much as 14 basis points, the most since May 2010. In one day, bond traders priced out about one-third of a rate cut for the remainder of the year.\n\nMere minutes before Rosengren\u2019s comments earlier this week, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard took the exact opposite view, telling Reuters that the central bank should slash interest rates by 50 basis points. The trade war, in his mind, is a \u201cglobal shock\u201d requiring \u201caggressive\u201d action. He has the ISM manufacturing index on his side, which fell into contraction in August. Carl Riccadonna, chief U.S. economist for Bloomberg Intelligence, said \u201cfear itself\u201d was evident among businesses because of \u201ceconomic uncertainty, fomented by market volatility and ongoing trade-war escalation.\u201d\n\nOf course, Powell doesn\u2019t have to win every voter over, as the past two decisions have shown. It\u2019s a foregone conclusion that he\u2019ll meet the two factions in the middle and gradually lower the fed funds rate by another quarter point.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s the prudent move. But it\u2019s fair to ask what exactly a quarter-point cut to interest rates will truly do for the U.S. economy \u2014 a question that Powell has struggled to answer in the past. It won\u2019t suddenly boost inflation. Companies aren\u2019t going to go out and immediately hire more workers. It seems unlikely to sharply weaken the dollar and make U.S. exports more competitive. At best, a rate cut will appease financial markets (though in July, it didn\u2019t even do that). At worst, it invites a more prolonged trade war while inching the Fed ever-closer to the zero bound.\n\nTo make matters even more challenging for the Fed, policy makers will give an update this month on their interest-rate projections, known as the \u201cdot plot.\u201d For the first time since June, they\u2019re going to have to estimate just how far they\u2019re willing to drop their benchmark to combat the ramifications of lasting trade disputes. That\u2019s where the dissent within the FOMC ranks could really shine through.", "description": "Trump \u2018Can\u2019t Win Them All.\u2019 Neither Can\u00a0Powell.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE7G0CO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
