She was sentenced to 14 days in prison. Along with 14 days in prison, Huffman was fined $30,000, ordered to do 250 hours of community service and will be on supervised release for a year.\n\nLoughlin, meanwhile, is facing up to a 40-year sentence.\n\nThe difference comes down to their plea decisions: Huffman pleaded guilty, while Loughlin pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe actresses are also accused of investing vastly different amounts of money in the scheme: $15,000 for Huffman and $500,000 for Loughlin.\n\nHuffman disguised her bribe as a charitable donation for disadvantaged youth\n\nHuffman is paid the scheme's ringleader, Rick Singer, $15,000 to have her eldest daughter's SAT score falsified so she could get into top colleges.\n\nAn affidavit said that Huffman arranged for her daughter to take the SAT at the West Hollywood Test Center, where her answers were later corrected, and that Huffman disguised the $15,000 as a charitable donation for disadvantaged young people.\n\nThe court document said Huffman had also arranged for her youngest daughter to be part of the scheme but later decided against it.\n\nRead more: Felicity Huffman has been sentenced to 14 days in prison for her role in the college admissions scandal\n\nHuffman agreed to plead guilty in April and appeared in court to give her guilty plea in May.
