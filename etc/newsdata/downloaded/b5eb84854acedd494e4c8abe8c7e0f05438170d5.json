Earlier Trump called the protests \u201criots\u201d that were a matter for China to deal with.\n\nSunday\u2019s protest was peaceful. Police have responded to violence over 14 weeks with water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas.\n\nThousands of protesters march to U.S. Consulate to demand the congress to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. #hongkongprotests #antielab #standwithhk #freehk pic.twitter.com/U7yQC6e5zO \u2014 Jessie Pang (@JessiePang0125) September 8, 2019\n\nRiot police cleared the Central MTR metro station, near Sunday\u2019s march, where activists smashed a long glass panel at a station entrance and other windows and daubed graffiti on the walls outside. Several arrests were made.\n\nHundreds of others milled about in surrounding streets lined with banks, jewelry shops and top-brand shopping arcades.\n\nMTR stations have been attacked recently because of televised scenes of police beating protesters on a train on Aug. 31 as they cowered on the floor. Protesters are demanding theMTR hands over CCTV footage of the beatings.\n\n\u201cWith the U.S. locked in a trade war with China at this point in time, it\u2019s a good opportunity for us to show (the United States) how the pro-China groups are also violating human rights in Hong Kong and allowing police brutality,\u201d said Cherry, 26, who works in the financial industry, as protesters marched towards the nearby U.S. Consulate.\n\n\u201cWe want the U.S. administration to help protect human rights in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nHong Kong returned to China under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.

It has denounced the protests, accusing the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest, and warned of the damage to the economy.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced concessions this week aimed at ending the protests, including formally scrapping a hugely unpopular extradition bill, which ignited the unrest inJune. Many protesters said it was too little, too late.\n\nThe bill would have allowed the extradition of people to mainland China to stand trial in courts controlled by theCommunist Party. Hong Kong has an independent judiciary dating back to British rule.\n\nBut the demonstrations have long since broadened into calls for democracy.\n\nU.S. legislation addressing China\u2019s actions in Hong Kong will be among the top priorities pushed by Senate Democrats when Congress returns to work after a recess next week, their leader,Senator Chuck Schumer, said on Thursday.\n\nSchumer urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican who sets the floor agenda, to bring up a bipartisan bill that would require an annual justification of the special treatment afforded by Washington to Hong Kong, including special trade and business privileges, under the U.S. Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992.\n\nThe legislation, called the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, would also mandate that officials in China andHong Kong who have undermined the city\u2019s autonomy are vulnerable to sanctions.\n\nProtesters, in their petition, urged that it be passed in full.\n\nTrump alternates between praising Chinese President XiJinping as a great leader and casting him as an enemy, while excoriating China for taking advantage of U.S. businesses.\n\nBeijing announced that top officials would head toWashington in early October to hold talks aimed at ending the tit-for-tat trade war, now in its second year, which has roiled markets and hammered global growth.\n\nJoshua Wong, one of the leaders of the pro-democracy\u201dUmbrella\u201d movement five years ago, was re-arrested at the airport on Sunday on return from Germany and the United States for breaching bail conditions, he said.\n\nHe had been charged with inciting and participating in an unauthorized assembly outside police headquarters on June 21 and released on bail.\n\n\u201cPreliminary legal advice suggested that the court had acknowledged and approved my trips to Germany and the U.S. when it granted bail on Aug. 30,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cTherefore, it is believed that there are some mistakes have been made on the bail certificate.\u201d\n\nHe said he thought he would be freed on Monday.\n\n(Additional reporting by Twinnie Siu, Jessie Pang, Sumeet Chatterjee and Tyrone Siu; Writing by Nick Macfie; Editing by Michael Perry)", "description": "Thousands of protesters -- many waving American flags and singing the Star Spangled Banner -- marched to the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d74d2573b00002a74d0c1e9.jpeg?cache=hb8skjr9dc&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
