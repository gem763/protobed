Read More\n\nWe already know quite a bit about Google's Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL, which will be announced during a special event on Oct. 15 in New York City. Of course, Google will announce more than the Pixel 4. We expect a new Google mesh Wi-Fi system, a new Pixelbook, perhaps new Pixel Buds, and (hopefully) a surprise or two.\n\nGoogle will livestream the event on YouTube for those who want to watch. It starts at 7 am PT/10 am ET.\n\nAs for Pixel 4, well, we pretty much have a complete picture now. Google tried to head off the leaks this year, by posting a photo and confirming the name of the phone, but that plan backfired. Countless photos, videos, specification sheets, and renders have leaked online since then and were posted far and wide.\n\nIn short, the Pixel 4 looks to be a stunning phone, and if all the leaks and rumors prove true, we're in for a treat.\n\nKeep in mind, until Google stands on a stage and officially announces the Pixel 4, any of the information below can change.\n\nWhen will it be available?\n\nIt will be announced on Oct. 15\n\nExact ship date is unknown right now\n\nAll we know is the phone will be announced on Oct. 15. We don't know when it will be available for preorder, or when it will begin shipping.\n\nHow much will it cost?\n\nHopefully similar to the Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL\n\nPricing hasn't leaked yet, and even if there are rumored numbers, the cost of new phones seems to be what all the leaks get wrong. A recent trend among smartphone makers is rising prices, but hopefully, Google finds a way to buck that and keep prices in line with the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, which launched at $799 and $899, respectively.\n\nImage: Evan Blass\n\nWhat will it look like?\n\nLike previous Pixels, but with a single color instead of two-tone\n\nA new camera arrangement looks a lot like the iPhone 11's\n\nNo notches this year\n\nThe Pixel line has always had a two-tone look on the back of the phone, but photos and videos leaked so far show a single color across the entire device. Evan Blass posted an image of the new \"Oh So Orange\" color, along with renders of a black version and a white version.\n\nAs you can see in the leaked render above, the Pixel 4 ditches any sort of display cutout or notch. Instead, the top bezel houses the front-facing camera setup that will be used for the Pixel's facial recognition/unlock feature.\n\nWhat about new features?\n\nProject Soli will allow hand gesture to control the Pixel 4\n\nFace unlock feature will debut\n\nImproved camera features\n\nSmarter Google Assistant\n\nGoogle confirmed that Project Soli, a radar-based system, will be used in Pixel 4. Using Motion Sense, you'll be able to wave your hand over the phone on a table to mute incoming calls, switch tracks, and similar tasks.\n\nAlso included in the Pixel 4 is a facial recognition system that can be used to unlock the phone, and presumably, make purchases with Google Pay. There's not a fingerprint sensor on the Pixel 4, so it makes sense that anything you used the fingerprint reader for can now be accomplished with face unlock.\n\nGoogle will take advantage of having two cameras on the Pixel 4 -- a first for the Pixel line -- by adding new exposure controls, and Night Sight is gaining the ability to photograph the stars. Once again, 9to5Google has all the info, complete with photo samples.\n\nGoogle Assistant will also see updates with the launch of the Pixel 4. Specifically, 9to5Google has a video of the new Google Assistant running on Pixel 4. In the video, Assistant appears to be smarter and more aware of what you're doing and can use that to complete tasks on your behalf. The website uses the example of receiving a text asking what time your flight lands from a friend. You ask Assistant to see your itinerary, and then ask Assistant to send a text with the time -- all without saying who to send the message to.\n\nWhat about the specs?\n\n9to5Google was able to get their hands on what it claims is the official spec sheet for the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL.\n\nHere's what we should expect:\n\nGoogle Pixel 4 specs\n\nDisplay: 5.7-inch Full HD+ Smooth Display (up to 90Hz OLED) -- Ambient EQ\n\nBattery: 2,800mAh\n\nProcessor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 855, Pixel Neural Core\n\nMemory: 6GB RAM\n\nStorage: 64GB, 128GB\n\nCameras: 12MP Dual-Pixel and 16MP Telephoto\n\nAudio: Stereo speakers\n\nSecurity: Titan M Security Module\n\nFeatures: Face unlock, Motion Sense\n\nOS: Android OS with three years of security and OS updates\n\nGoogle Pixel 4 XL specs\n\nDisplay: 6.3-inch Quad HD+ Smooth Display (up to 90Hz OLED) -- Ambient EQ\n\nBattery: 3,700mAh\n\nProcessor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 855, Pixel Neural Core\n\nMemory: 6GB RAM\n\nStorage: 64GB, 128GB\n\nCameras: 12MP Dual-Pixel and 16MP Telephoto\n\nAudio: Stereo speakers\n\nSecurity: Titan M Security Module\n\nFeatures: Face unlock, Motion Sense\n\nOS: Android OS with three years of security and OS updates\n\nPerhaps the most notable aspect of the spec sheet is that the Pixel 4 will have a 90Hz display, which should make common tasks like gaming and scrolling through your Facebook feel smoother.", "description": "If you're waiting to switch from iOS or upgrade to Google's Pixel 4, here's everything you need to know.", "authors": ["Jason Cipriani"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/12/230d154f-75a4-457a-9828-dca5cb311e18/thumbnail/770x578/37ccb13f55e2b1f1f83589d9845ba15a/google-pixel-4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
