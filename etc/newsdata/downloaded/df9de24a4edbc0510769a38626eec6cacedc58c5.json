The rate cuts, which were the first in over a decade, will provide a hit to net interest margin, or the spread between interest income earned from their borrowers and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders, at U.S. banks.\n\n\u201cWe expect net interest margins (NIM) to be down at all banks QoQ and down at a faster rate QoQ by 8bp on average, with loan growth as a partial or full offset to NIM at some banks,\u201d JPMorgan analyst Vivek Juneja wrote.\n\nThat loan growth could be a silver lining for the banks as they experience a boost of loan originations. A Goldman Sachs research team expects loan growth to accelerate by 50 basis points in the quarter to a 3 percent year-over-year rate.\n\nThe increase in loan volume is expected to help partially offset the drop in revenue caused by lower interest rates.\n\nSpeaking at the Barclays Global Financial Services Conference on Sept. 10, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank\u2019s net interest income would be about $57 billion, down from his July forecast of $57.5 billion, due the damage from the Fed\u2019s rate cuts. Other banks also lowered their forecasts.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cAbout a year ago, I thought rates would be heading up, not down,\u201d Dimon said.", "description": "The big banks kick off third-quarter earnings season on Tuesday morning.", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/banks-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
