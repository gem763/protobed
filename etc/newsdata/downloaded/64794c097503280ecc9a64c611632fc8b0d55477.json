I think you can always look back and say \u2018what if, what if?\u2019 but if you keep asking like questions you drive yourself crazy.\u201d\n\nBut she added that being unable to persuade the International Ski Federation to let her compete against men was another regret.\n\n\u201cI think that was probably one of the most frustrating things, besides not breaking the [victory] record,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI really wanted to compete against the men, because they\u2019re faster than the women and I wanted to improve myself.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t men against women, it was just men were better and I wanted to race against the best.\u201d\n\nRetirement this year was inevitable, however, because her body was telling her it was enough.\n\nShe said the future for female skiers was bright and labelled fellow American Mikaela Shiffrin as most likely to exceed even her 82 race victories.\n\n\u201cThe only thing she needs to think about now is just staying healthy. And that was my problem, during my career,\u201d Vonn said.\n\nAnd beyond skiing there is plenty to keep her occupied, from finishing her memoirs and starting a beauty line for active people to executive producing a movie.\n\nOn top of all that, she has her upcoming wedding to Canadian ice hockey player PK Subban \u2014 although the couple have yet to set a date or a venue.", "description": "The retired four-time world champion tells Euronews she really wanted to complete against male skiers because they were faster", "authors": ["Cinzia Rizzi"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/13/26/1000x563_cmsv2_8cae5b28-4474-59c4-86e6-d83b3c2aa97c-4231326.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
