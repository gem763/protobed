When Jessi (Jessi Klein) tells Andrew to stop being a creep, he snaps at her: \u201cYou\u2019re the ones that dressed up all sexy, and then you get mad at us for saying you\u2019re sexy. It\u2019s like \u2026 what do you bitches want from us?\u201d Nick (Nick Kroll) tries to calm him down by insisting that the girls aren\u2019t bitches\u2014they\u2019re sluts, per the name of the march. When Jessi tries to explain that only the girls can call themselves that, as a way of reclaiming a derogatory term, an exasperated Nick gives up, saying, \u201cLook, I\u2019m just trying to be an ally to women.\u201d Andrew and Jay immediately turn on him for this meek expression of solidarity and call him a \u201cpussy.\u201d\n\nFortunately, Big Mouth regularly grants its young characters the opportunity to become wiser about the grown-up world\u2014and to challenge their instinctive responses to its seeming contradictions. Sometimes that means being confronted with a more extreme version of their nascent beliefs. After Andrew vlogs about how hard it is to be a boy these days, a stranger invites him to a meeting of similarly fatigued men. The other attendees of \u201cMen 4 Equality\u201d seem at first to empathize with Andrew\u2014until their complaints escalate into wider-ranging anger about \u201cPC bullshit.\u201d Andrew, who is Jewish, leaves aghast after the group\u2019s ostensible leader declares that they must create \u201ca patriarchal ethno-state of pure European blood.\u201d\n\nThe scene is as ridiculous as it is harrowing: Andrew witnesses one Men 4 Equality representative telling another character that he can\u2019t purchase a Nazi dildo because his credit card has been declined. There are even two nonhumans on-screen (a \u201chormone monster\u201d and a \u201cshame wizard\u201d) while Andrew witnesses the hatefulness that his resentment brought him close to. Big Mouth retains its characteristically goofy and surreal elements, while making the insightful case that groups such as Men 4 Equality are often motivated by overlapping forms of hatred toward marginalized groups.\n\nAndrew may be the only character who unwittingly aligns himself with Nazis by nurturing his indignation toward his female classmates, but Big Mouth emphasizes that the boys\u2019 regressive attitudes are informed by the men around them. The teens borrow heavily from the language of their administrators at school, and from their parents\u2019 behavior: Jay repeats that boys like him are \u201canimals,\u201d insisting that it must be true because their dean said so. Later, his father yells at the mother of Jay\u2019s friend Missy: \u201cGod, you\u2019re so shrill! You sound like a goddamn teapot!\u201d\n\nBig Mouth\u2019s choice to directly address toxic masculinity is welcome in part because the series draws natural connections between different kinds of intolerance\u2014and their solutions\u2014without equating them with one another. When Andrew ultimately confesses to Nick that he wound up at a white-supremacist meeting, he tearfully admits that the experience of being around people who \u201chated Jews so much\u201d showed him just how irrational his rage toward the girls had been. The moment shared between the two boys is an earnestly rendered depiction of Andrew\u2019s growth, but they\u2019re not the heroes of the dress-code saga. Even after his personal wake-up call, Andrew gets a necessary dressing-down from Missy, an ex whom he has harbored unfair resentment toward since the end of Season 2. Big Mouth gives the boys the chance to shake off some of the dangerous influences around them, while also giving credit to the difficult work their female classmates have to do to simply be treated as equals.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
