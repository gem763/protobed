They have refused to hold direct talks with the Afghan government until a US deal is agreed.\n\nMr Stanikzai said intra-Afghan talks would have started on 23 September, had a deal been reached, and would have included discussions about a wider ceasefire.\n\nHe also confirmed that the Taliban had approached both Russia and China for help in the peace negotiations.\n\nMeanwhile the Afghan national security advisor said that Taliban \"intimidation tactics\" would not succeed.\n\n\"The only way they can see peace in Afghanistan is by negotiating with the Afghan government,\" Dr Hamdullah Mohibt told the BBC.\n\nHe added: \"Open discussions with our neighbours, those who are sponsoring and supporting the Taliban - that needs to be at the front of our discussions, not the back of it.\"\n\nWhat is the security situation in Afghanistan?\n\nAn average of 74 people were killed every day in the country in August, according to data collected by the BBC.\n\nWithout a deal, attacks are continuing unabated. Two suicide bombers on Tuesday left at least 48 people dead. Medical staff said children were among the casualties at an election rally targeted by one bomber. President Ghani had been due to speak ahead of elections later this month.\n\nBoth attacks were claimed by the Taliban.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption A man who was injured in one of two suicide attacks on Tuesday\n\nHowever, when pressed on the high civilian death toll, Mr Stanikzai blamed \"foreign forces\", citing United Nations statistics which show more civilians were killed by Afghan and US forces in the first half of 2019 than by insurgents.\n\nHe also defended the Taliban for taking shelter in civilian homes, and refused to be drawn on the many direct Taliban attacks which had killed ordinary men, women and children.", "description": "Negotiations remain the \"only\" path to peace, a top Taliban official tells the BBC's Lyse Doucet.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07nlvrz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
