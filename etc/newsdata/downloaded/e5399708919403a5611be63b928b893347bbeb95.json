She had already carried the child for over six months which was very surprising for her age.\n\n\u201cIf we had not delivered the baby, she might have died in the womb.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Woman gives birth to 13lbs \u2018sumo wrestler\u2019 baby - almost double size of average newborn\n\nThe woman and her 80-year-old husband already have an adopted child [Photo: Caters] More\n\nThe doctor went on to say she could not verify Mrs Devi's age as the mother did not bring any identification with her.\n\nDr Abhilasha added: \u201cShe told us her age but showed no proof. She looked between 72 and 75. Her husband told us he is 80. It was surprising for me.\n\n\u201cHer age was a factor and then she was ill. She has one collapsed lung so it was a very challenging operation.\"\n\nThough the baby\u2019s mother has been discharged her daughter is staying at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of the hospital where the doctors are monitoring her condition.\n\n\"She is at neonatal intensive care unit. We are monitoring her. The mother cannot feed her unless she gains weight, said Dr Abhilasha.\n\n\"She needs to be at least 3.3lbs to be allowed home from hospital. She is stable and recovering fast.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Internet praises 'amazing' human body after viral picture shows woman's bones moving during birth\n\nLast month it was revealed that a couple had become the world\u2019s oldest parents after giving birth to twin girls.\n\nErramatti Mangayamma, 74, and her husband Raja Rao, 78, successfully delivered two healthy babies on September 5th.\n\nThe pair tried to conceive throughout their marriage until they successfully underwent IVF treatment from Ahalya Hospital last year.", "description": "The baby was delivered at 30 weeks weighing a tiny 1lb 5oz.", "authors": ["Marie Claire Dorking"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bReI9Btp5QFvs5I_AwP9bQ--~B/aD0zMDA0O3c9NDAwOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/37889d30-f00a-11e9-bf7e-5f07b5edd45f", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
