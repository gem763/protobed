Toler did not dispute the use of the \"N-word\" during the tirade.\n\n\"By no means did I call my players the N-word,\" Toler told ESPN. \"I'm not saying that I couldn't have used it in a context. But it wasn't directed at any of my players.\n\nPenny Toler had been general manager of the Los Angeles Sparks for 20 seasons.

I shouldn't. Nobody should. ... But you know, like I said, I'm not here to defend word by word by word what I said. I know some of the words that I'm being accused of are embellished. Did I give a speech that I hoped would get our team going? Yes.\"\n\nThe Sparks lost Game 3 and coach Derek Fisher had the entire starting five, including key players Candace Parker, Alana Beard and Nneka Ogwumike, on the bench as the third quarter ended.\n\nToler, a founding member of the WNBA who scored the league's first basket, had been the Sparks GM for 20 seasons.
