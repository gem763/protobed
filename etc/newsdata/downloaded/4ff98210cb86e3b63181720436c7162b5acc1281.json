This could then impact on pricing and affordability for individual customers.\n\nSarah Nield, financial services risk and regulation director at PwC, said: 'Given the largest commissions received by brokers tend to come via the models set to be banned, it will be interesting to see how lenders, brokers and dealerships react.\n\n'Although we expect firms to comply with the spirit of the changes, it could result in unintended consequences, including increased flat-fee commission payments, car prices and bundled product costs.\n\n'While a number of lenders and brokers have already made positive changes in response to the FCA's March report, tight implementation timeframes for these new rules may prove challenging and costly for some.'\n\nJames Fairclough, chief executive of AA Cars, added: 'The FCA has concluded, quite rightly, that there is no inherent problem with car finance products themselves.\n\n'However customers are poorly served if they are not shown all the options best suited to them, whether through a lack of transparency, deliberate misinformation or because brokers are trying to steer them toward a particular product purely in order to secure a discretionary commission.\n\n'Transparency and clarity are essential for the car finance industry to serve customers properly, and the FCA's proposal would make it easier for car buyers to compare different deals and shop around.\n\n'It could also bring the price of finance down if it triggers greater competition on interest rates between lenders and removes the distorting effect of discretionary broker commission.'\n\nThe FCA is also proposing to make changes to the way in which customers are told about the commission they are paying to ensure that they receive more relevant information.\n\nThese changes would apply to many types of credit brokers and not just those selling motor finance.\n\nThe FCA is consulting on the new rules until 15 January 2020 and plans to publish final rules later in 2020.", "description": "The Financial Conduct Authority is introducing a ban on car sellers and brokers charging commission linked to the interest rate customers pay on loans to buy cars.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
