I'm a very loving father.'\n\nFormer model Jeremy, who's expecting a baby with girlfriend Katie McCreath, 35, said he's found it difficult to be accepted back into society after being imprisoned for five weeks in 2017.\n\nFormer lovers: Jeremy McConnell admits 'not every situation can be fixed' after the dramatic downfall of his romance with Stephanie Davis (pictured in 2017)\n\nJeremy admitted he agreed to take a step back from Caben to protect him, and his unborn daughter has become his 'main focus.'\n\nHe said: 'A lot of people say I don't care about my child because I'm moving on but what options was I left with? I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't.\n\n'People say to me \"Why are you acting like you have just one child?\" But there's a time and a place. Any one that has half a brain cell needs to understand the reason I am not part of Caben's life is because not every situation can be fixed.\n\n'I protect my son as much as I can. It's not neglecting, it's protecting. I'm a very loving father. This is better for Caben.\n\nMother and son: Former CBB star Jeremy says he isn't in Caben's life to 'protect him' and credits Hollyoaks actress Stephanie for being a 'good mum' (pictured in 2018)\n\nSecond chances: Jeremy says his unborn daughter, that he shares with girlfriend Katie McCreath, has become his 'main focus' (pictured in October)\n\n'My priority is my baby girl because it's in my control \u2013 I have rights over that. My main focus is my girl.\n\n'I've done all the things I needed to do in order to get where I am now. I've got an amazing job and I've moved myself away from certain things.'\n\nJeremy credited Hollyoaks actress Stephanie, 26, for her hard work as a mother but admitted he struggled to cope when her ex Owen Warner, 20, formed a close bond with Caben.\n\nHe said: 'I can't speak about it much for legal reasons, but Steph is doing a great job. She\u2019s doing really well and I know she\u2019s a good mum.\n\n'But you can imagine how hard it was for me. Some 20-year-old being called dad in her last relationship. I thought the whole thing was really distasteful.'\n\nTough: The ex-model said he struggled to see Caben spend time with Stephanie's ex Owen Warner and found the 'whole thing really distastful' (pictured earlier this year)\n\nMoving on: Jeremy says he's living proof a leopard can change its spots and going to prison in 2017 was a massive 'wake up call' (pictured in 2017)\n\nIn August 2017, Jeremy was found guilty of battering Stephanie in a drug-fuelled rage.\n\nHe was sentenced to 20 weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months \u2013 but was later jailed for breaching his community order by flying to Turkey for a hair transplant.\n\nJeremy says he's living proof a leopard can change its spots after getting himself back on the straight and narrow the last two years.\n\nHe explained: 'Going to prison was a massive wake up call. I had to sit myself down and say \"This is it now\".\n\n'It was hard because in this country people don\u2019t accept rehabilitation well. People need to believe that you can change.\n\nStraight and narrow: The businessman said coming out of prison and starting afresh was' hard because in this country people don\u2019t accept rehabilitation' (pictured in August 2017)\n\n'A leopard never changes his spots isn't true \u2013 I have proven that I have rehabilitated. I hope over a two year period I've shown that. I was an embarrassment to myself. I acted like a f**king d**khead.'\n\nThe former Celebrity Big Brother star suffered the devastating loss of his mother, brother and sister within months of each other when he was a teenager and his dad lost his battle with cancer in 2017.\n\nHe said his 'bad boy' image was just a persona he adopted as he fell down a dangerous path of drink and drug taking.\n\nJeremy continued: 'My dad always told me where there's drink, there's trouble.\n\n'People don\u2019t realise when you have depression and a mental illness that you don\u2019t like yourself as a person.\n\n'Especially when you don\u2019t have your parents around saying what's right or wrong. But I can't change the past.\n\n'I was trying to be a bad boy but really I'm not. I was a virgin until I was 18! I'm a well brought up man, I just got lost down that path.'\n\nJeremy has managed to turn his life around by becoming director of company Hair of Istanbul.\n\nHe's become close pals with CEO M Faith Akendir and together they plan to expand the hair transplant business across the globe.", "description": "The reality star, 29, has admitted 'not every situation can be fixed' as he slams trolls for claiming he doesn't care about his two-year-old son Caben-Albi.
