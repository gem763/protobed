The first time it is left on its own is always the hardest\n\nOne Twitter user said they weren't 'mentally stable enough' for some of the images which aired on the BBC One show earlier tonight\n\nOne Twitter user said: 'I'm not mentally stable enough for the baby albatross dying.' This is while another added: 'Thanks David Attenborough, mrs is crying over an albatross.'\n\nSir David explained that the 70mph winds that were hitting the baby Albatross were due to climate change, and that this had presented a problem that adult Albatross' were unable to deal with.\n\nThe programme also highlights the climate emergency and how this is having an impact of various species of animals across the world.\n\nDuring the documentary, Sir David said a lot of the issues are due to a 'change in the climate and added that the 'warming of coldest region on earth effecting weather patterns'.\n\nOne Twitter user said those filming the documentary should 'help' the animals being shown after the bird was filmed struggling\n\nThe Albatross was snug for a while until winds battered the area, forcing it out of its next and onto the floor below, where its father could not see it\n\nThe adult Albatross was seen flying away in order to retrieve food for its baby, before it left it they both touch beaks as a sign of affection\n\nHe added that species such as the Albatross 'can't keep pace' with the 'changes effecting their world'.\n\nThe baby Albatross was left on its own for a while when its parents went to get food. It fell out of its nest when winds hit 70mph and was unable to get back in.\n\nIt fell underneath the nest, right beneath the feet of its father.\n\nGrown Albatrosses are unable to recognise their babies by sight and only no its them if they are settled in the nest.\n\nThe baby gradually made its way back into the nest, where it was then welcomed by its father.\n\nOther users highlighted how Sir David was 'dissapointed' with the human race because of the climate emergency, after he stated that humans were one of the biggest predators for some of the Antarctic's population.\n\nSocial media users said that his documentaries had taught them 'immeasurable amount about the planet'.\n\nKelly said: 'This mans knowledge has taught me immeasurable amounts about nature and planet earth. The term 'National Treasure' is banded around all too often these days, but Attenborough is more than worthy of that title'.\n\nThe show focused on some of the most beautiful animals on the Antarctic. Many viewers also loved the segment about penguins\n\nAnother hilarious moment of the show was when some baby penguins had been left on their own, after their parents had gone to find them food.\n\nSt Andrews bay in south Georgia is packed with half a million penguins and the director was able to capture just how much space they have, as well as some great interactions between the animals.\n\nThe deal between them being that the baby penguin would remain in the same spot so that the parent could return and feed it.\n\nBut some penguins wanted to explore and went over to some other animals that had been resting where they were exploring.\n\nThey got a nasty fright when it jumped up to scare them away, with many of them fleeing in the opposite direction.\n\nThe programme also followed a group of penguins chicks (above) the image above shows them shaking and drying off\n\nThe documentary also explored underneath the frozen tops of the sea where many of the land animals frolick in the day.\n\nSir David said that by the end of winter the continent doubles in size making it the largest desert in the world.\n\nHe said: 'The frozen surface of the sea hides a great secret. It may be hostile above the ice but below it conditions are so stable that life has had time to diversify. Creatures grow to a great size.'\n\n'Only beginning to discover the details of these creatures.'", "description": "Viewers of new Sir David Attenborough 'Seven Worlds, One Planet, were left in tears last night after watching the plight of a baby Albatross in Antarctica.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/20/20254288-0-image-a-45_1572207406276.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
