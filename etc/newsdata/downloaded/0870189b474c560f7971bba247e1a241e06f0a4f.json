DJing is actually a really small part of it, really we are just travellers.\"\n\nBlond:ish says DJs can often travel from island to island, country to country, playing sets and urges the industry to \"take small steps like offsetting our carbon\".\n\nOffsetting carbon means travellers pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight.\n\nThe money is then invested in environmental projects - like planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce the carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount.\n\nHowever, some activists criticise carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour.\n\nImage caption Plastic often ends up in the sea after tourists leave the island\n\n\"We are partying in paradise, and paradises have sensitive ecosystems which can't withstand the city lifestyle,\" says Blond:ish.\n\nThrough her campaign group, Bye Bye Plastic, Blond:ish also encourages artists to go plastic-free on their riders, which is the food and drink they request for backstage and in the DJ booths when they play.\n\nShe said: \"Bye Bye plastic upgraded our riders to be single-use plastic-free.\" She says this is a \"tiny step\" but that if DJs, agents and clubbers all pitch in, it will eventually influence the clubs.\n\nBut some clubs in Ibiza are already proactively tackling pollution.\n\nIconic night club Pacha is the first club to sign up to the Ibiza Preservation's plastic-free star rating system, gaining the first star.\n\nThe scheme hopes to phase out single-use plastics in Ibiza by 2023, and rewards nightclubs that commit to banning plastics with a star.\n\nIts chief executive, Nick McCabe, says the the venue gets through more than 400,000 plastic straws, and a similar number of plastic bottles on an annual basis.\n\nFounded in 1973, Nick, says: \"Pacha is as much Ibiza as the sand and sea.\" He says he hopes it continues to evolve with the island.\n\nIt has already managed to eliminate straws, plastic cutlery, laundry bags and plastic food containers, but Nick says finding a solution to plastic bottles is challenging from a \"safety perspective\".\n\nHe said the star rating system is an \"interesting way to feel like there is some kind of reward for companies who get board for what we should be doing anyway\".\n\nTourists are getting involved, too.\n\nEd Pronc is Dutch but has been holidaymaking in Ibiza with his partner for years.\n\nHe was shocked into creating a \"plastic-picker catamaran\" after he and his partner went for a ride on their boat, and ended up finding a sea turtle trapped in plastic.\n\nImage caption Ed says he was shocked to find a sea turtle trapped in plastic while sailing\n\n\"We let it free,\" he said, \"but after that, we noticed there was a lot of plastic floating around.\"\n\nNow, Ed and his partner go out with a team of volunteers every single day to collect rubbish.\n\nAfter only an hour of picking, Ed says he can typically find every type of plastic imaginable, from plastic bottles, to food sacks, wiring, ropes, razors and tooth brushes.\n\nHe said they also find \"refrigerator doors occasionally\" too.\n\n\"I know if we hit the right spots we can collect 10, 20, 30 bags of plastics every day,\" says Ed.\n\nHe notes that 130,000 people live on the island here all year round, and they are saddened by the way it is \"abused\".\n\nEd says anyone with an \"active conscience\" shouldn't be able to throw or even drink from a plastic bottle anymore.\n\nFollow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here.", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of Brits travel to Ibiza each summer, but what happens to their waste when they leave?", "authors": ["Amber Haque", "Shamaan Freeman-Powell", "Victoria Derbyshire", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0D96/production/_109187430_de27-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
