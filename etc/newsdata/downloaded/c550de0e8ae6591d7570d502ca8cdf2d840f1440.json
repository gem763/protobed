Trump acknowledged Monday he didn't want to give money to Ukraine if there were corruption issues. His comments raised further questions about whether he improperly used his office to pressure the country into investigating the former vice president and his family.\n\nHunter Biden worked for a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.\n\nOn \"The Five,\" Williams backed the elder Biden's claim Trump is highlighting Hunter Biden's relationship to the natural gas company because he wants to fend off a potential general election challenge.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I think Joe Biden is right,\" he said. \"Joe Biden sees that he is the target of Trump's ire because Trump sees -- as every poll indicates -- that Biden could 'beat him like a drum'.\"\n\nEarlier, Biden used the description in his own critique of the president.\n\n\"Trump's doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum,\" he told reporters in Iowa over the weekend. \"And, he's using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to do something to smear me.\"\n\nThe whistleblower's allegation could prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. Joe Biden has explained on camera that in March 2016, he privately threatened then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor was not fired.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019re not getting the billion,'\" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko at a Council on Foreign Relations event. \"I\u2019m going to be leaving here, in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.'\"\n\n\u201cWell, son of a b---h, he got fired,\" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.\n\nFox News' Gregg Re and Andrew O'Reilly contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump is attacking former Vice President Joe Biden over his son Hunter's involvement with a Ukrainian energy firm because recent polls show him defeating the president head-to-head, according to Juan Williams.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/juan-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
