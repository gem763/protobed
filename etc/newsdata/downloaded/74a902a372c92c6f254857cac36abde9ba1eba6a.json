Which is why she's one of just a handful of artists who've been invited back to the Tiny Desk to offer a revised musical vision.\n\nWhen she was here last with the band Y La Bamba, it was a vocal-heavy, folk outfit. The band's sound has always been about vocals and her music has become even more so over the years.\n\nNow she's assembled a different crew with two electric guitars and keyboards that are layered underneath her passionate vocals. And for this turn behind the desk, having played together night after night results in a musical mind-meld that is heard in how the songs seamlessly morph from one to another.\n\nY La Bamba's albums are meticulously crafted sonic treats with her vocals layered like a choir made with a single voice. But in our offices, she called on vocalist Isabeau Waia'u Walker to replicate their distinct sound. \"Paloma Negra\" benefits from the voices of the entire band in a high-energy mediation on rhythm and voice.\n\nThere is a bruja energy and spirit to their performance, and not in the negative connotation that is the Spanish word for \"witch.\" In Luz Elena Mendoza's hands a brujeria spirit is all about conjuring the kind of magic that took place on this video.\n\nSET LIST\n\n\"Paloma Negra\"\n\n\"Rios Sueltos\"\n\n\"Bruja de Brujas\"\n\n\"Cuatro Crazy\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nRyan Oxford: vocals, guitar; Luz Elena Mendoza: vocals, guitar; Julia Mendiolea: vocals, keys; Isabeau Waia'u Walker: vocals; Miguel Jimenez-Cruz: drums; Zachary Teran: vocals, bass\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Beck Harlan; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Beck Harlan, Kara Frame, CJ Riculan, Maia Stern; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Production Assistant: Paul Georgoulis; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Shuran Huang/NPR", "description": "Y La Bamba returns for its second Tiny Desk performance with a revised musical vision.", "authors": ["Felix Contreras"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/18/ylabamba-shuang_wide-db2df5fa1cb1206b02a09ff0f05e64029629130f.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
