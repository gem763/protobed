said.\n\nActivity by social media accounts linked to the agency jumped more than 200 per cent on Instagram and more than 50 per cent on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube after Mr Trump\u2019s victory, the committee found.\n\n\u201cBy flooding social media with false reports, conspiracy theories, and trolls, and by exploiting existing divisions, Russia is trying to breed distrust of our democratic institutions and our fellow Americans,\u201d said Richard Burr, the Republican chair of the committee.\n\nThe long-awaited report, published on Tuesday, reaffirmed findings by the US intelligence community and special counsel Robert Mueller that the Kremlin had sought to swing the 2016 vote in favour of Mr Trump.\n\nOn YouTube, all of the IRA\u2019s political videos were opposed to Ms Clinton. Some were aimed at dissuading black Americans to vote, while others suggested they vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In the key swing state of Michigan, one study found that ratio \u201cwas most disproportionate the day before the election.\u201d\n\nOne IRA-run Facebook page with more than 200,000 followers, \u201cArmy of Jesus,\u201d posted only pro-Christian messages until just before the election. It then published a false story claiming Ms Clinton had approved removing the word \u201cGod\u201d from the US Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nThe disinformation campaign went well beyond Facebook and Twitter, sweeping up Medium, Tumblr and Pinterest as well, the committee noted.\n\nThe report recommended congress consider new laws requiring disclosure of who pays for election-related online advertising. Senators expressed particular alarm at sophisticated micro-targeting, warning the IRA could have been much more effective in swing states if it had used Facebook tools for customising audiences instead of just using geography.\n\n\u201cPropagandists will be able to continue to utilise increasingly advanced off-the-shelf capabilities to target specific individuals with highly targeted messaging campaigns,\u201d said the detailed 85-page report.\n\nIt also called on social media companies, which have come under fire for allowing propaganda to flourish, should share more information about what they find on their platforms.", "description": "Russian agents who sought to influence the US presidential election toasted Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 victory with champagne and declared they had \u201cmade American great,\u201d according to a Senate Intelligence Committee report.", "authors": ["Chris Baynes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/09/09/putin-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
