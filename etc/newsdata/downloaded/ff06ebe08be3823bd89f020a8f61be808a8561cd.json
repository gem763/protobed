Gruden, 52, posted a 35-49-1 record in six years with the franchise.\n\nThe New England Patriots beat the Redskins 33-7 Sunday at FedEx Field in Landover, Md. Gruden told reporters after the game that he had not been told anything regarding his job security.\n\n\u201cNobody told me anything and I don\u2019t have a concern,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI\u2019ll just wait and see. If the key works on Monday, I\u2019ll keep working. Go attack the Miami Dolphins and plan on getting our first win next week.\u201d\n\nWashington went 7-9 in each of the last two seasons. The Redskins were 4-12 in 2014, Gruden\u2019s first season. Washington turned it around for a 9-7 mark and a playoff appearance in 2015 before going 8-7-1 in 2016.\n\nGruden entered the NFL as an offensive assistant for his brother, Jon Gruden, with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2002. He was the offensive coordinator for the Cincinnati Bengals for three years before joining the Redskins.\n\nWashington has the fifth-worst offense in the NFL, in terms of yards per game. The Redskins are averaging the third-fewest points, but are allowing the third-most points, per game.\n\nThe winless Redskins face the winless Miami Dolphins at 1 p.m. EDT Sunday at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami.", "description": "Oct. 7 (UPI) \u2014 The Washington Redskins have fired head coach Jay Gruden after an 0-5 start to the 2019 season.
