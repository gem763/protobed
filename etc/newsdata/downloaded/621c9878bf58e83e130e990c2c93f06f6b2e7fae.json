'It was not our intention to offend anyone and we want to express our deepest apologies for the use of that phrase.'\n\nThe outlet's gaff occurred on a night when the Braves organization was already taking heat from both sides of the political spectrum for its famous tomahawk chop chant.\n\nAtlanta fans ignored the wishes of their team and their opponent's Native-American pitcher Wednesday night by continuing to perform the famous battle cry during their a blowout loss to the Cardinals.\n\nThe controversy emerged after the Braves organization was already facing criticism for its tomahawk mascot and famous tomahawk chop chant\n\nCardinals pitcher Ryan Helsley, who is Native American, criticized the use of Native Americans and their culture as mascots on Friday\n\nBraves officials agreed earlier in the day to try to limit the use of the chant Wednesday night in response to recent remarks made by St. Louis rookie pitcher Ryan Helsley, 25, who is Cherokee.\n\nHelsley told reporters on Friday that he disapproves of how Native Americans are used as sports mascots by teams like the Braves, the Washington Redskins, and the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\n'I think it\u2019s a misrepresentation of the Cherokee people or Native Americans in general, just depicts them in this kind of caveman-type people way who aren\u2019t intellectual,' the reliever said to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\n\nThe Braves responded to Helsley's comments on Wednesday saying the team won't distribute foam tomahawks to seated fans the way it normally does for its latest game against the Cardinals\n\nHis remarks came a day after he took the mound against the Braves in Atlanta as fans performed their long-time chant, complete with the waving of their novelty foam tomahawks.\n\nThe Braves responded to Helsley's comments on Wednesday saying the team won't distribute foam tomahawks to seated fans the way it normally does, but that didn't stop Atlanta fans from performing the chop chant with their arms or belting the battle cry during the game.\n\nSome hecklers took their frustrations out on Helsley on social media after his team's win.\n\n'@_RHelsley it must suck going through life being so delicate,' one Twitter user wrote.\n\n'F***ing grow up and stop being a crybaby!!!' added another.\n\nHelsley hasn't commented publicly on the backlash as of yet.", "description": "Fox affiliate KTVU-TV in Oakland, California featured the cringey 'BRAVES SCALPED' lower-third graphic during its 6pm broadcast Wednesday night before apologizing Thursday.", "authors": ["Chauncey Alcorn For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/03/19567386-0-image-a-4_1570761835294.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
