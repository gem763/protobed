He asked for more funding, even from private sources, to restore destroyed sites.\n\n\u201cI honestly hope that this is the small end of the funding,\u201d Mr. Brownback said. \u201cThe bigger end is how do you crowdsource on something.\u201d\n\nIn her opening statement, commission Vice Chair Gayle Manchin noted instances of overt violence and subtler actions such as government\u2019s video surveillance of holy sites and the Iranian regime locking the doors of a Christian church that have rattled the faithful.\n\n\u201cWe are also deeply troubled and concerned about the less overt tactics that threaten them,\u201d Ms. Manchin said. \u201cThese are more scary than overt actions.\u201d\n\nOther disturbing trends included the destruction of Uighur cemeteries in northwest China and gun attacks like that at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last year.\n\n\u201cThese attacks were not supposed to happen in the United States,\u201d said panelist Hassan Abbas, professor of the Near East South Asia Strategic Studies Centre at the National Defense University in Washington. \u201cThe currency of our conversations has become violent.\u201d\n\nTangible solutions remain elusive. One international response forwarded by Miguel Angel Moratinos, the U.N. High Representative for the Alliance of Civilizations, imagined mapping \u2014 by Google and international observers \u2014 of holy sites and places of worship.\n\nThe ability of powerful nations like China and Russia to continue to persecute religious minorities appeared a bulwark, as evidenced by the recent incursion of Turkish forces into Northern Syria, a Kurdish region, with many diverse faiths.\n\nCommissioner Gary Bauer noted the commission had become aware of Chinese officials pressuring other nations indebted to Beijing to not attend the second ministerial on religious liberty, held in July in Washington.\n\n\u201cI will have a dialogue with them and try to identify the problem,\u201d Mr. Moratinos said.\n\nPanelists also looked at physical security measures at places of worship. Mr. Perkins noted that the synagogue in Halle, Germany, on Yom Kippur had installed security cameras and fortified its main entrance, measures that likely saved dozens of lives. The funding came from the Jewish Agency for Israel, the world\u2019s largest Jewish nonprofit.\n\nMs. Manchin asked if the \u201cnew normal will be security around the churches.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we have to find the right balance,\u201d replied Mr. Moratinos. \u201cIf you go to church or mosque or synagogue it is a special moment for each person.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
