However, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation said it would be a minority government, forced to rely on an opposition party to stay in power.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s way better than I expected. It was conceivable that the Liberals would lose,\u201d said Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto.\n\n\u201cTrudeau is going to have to command a caucus that will not be as grateful than it was in 2015. A lot of them will say \u2018Look we won but not because of you.\u201d\u2019\n\nThe Canadian vote came down to what was essentially a choice between the handsome and charismatic Trudeau and the Conservatives\u2019 unassuming leader, Andrew Scheer, who was seen as the perfect antidote to Trudeau\u2019s flash and celebrity.\n\nTrudeau reasserted liberalism in 2015 after almost 10 years of Conservative Party government in Canada, but a series of scandals combined with high expectations threatened his prospects.\n\nHandsome and charismatic, Trudeau reasserted liberalism in 2015 after almost 10 years of Conservative Party government in Canada, but a series of scandals combined with high expectations damaged his prospects.\n\nPerhaps sensing Trudeau was in trouble, Barack Obama made an unprecedented endorsement by a former American president in urging Canadians to re-elect Trudeau and saying the world needs his progressive leadership now.\n\nTrudeau, son of the liberal icon and late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, is one of the few remaining progressive leaders in the world. He has been viewed as a beacon for liberals in the Trump era, even appearing on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine under the headline \u201cWhy Can\u2019t He Be Our President?\u201d\n\nBut old photos of Trudeau in blackface and brownface surfaced last month, casting doubt on his judgment.\n\nScheer is a career politician who was seen as a possible antidote to Trudeau\u2019s flash. Scheer, 40, called Trudeau a phony who can\u2019t even recall how many times he has worn blackface.\n\nTrudeau also was hurt by a scandal that erupted this year when his former attorney general said he pressured her to halt the prosecution of a Quebec company. Trudeau has said he was standing up for jobs, but the damage gave a boost to the Conservative Party.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s Liberals will likely rely on the New Democrats to form a new government and stay in power.\n\nScheer has promised to end a national carbon tax and cut government spending, including foreign aid, by 25%. \u201cThat money belongs to you, not to them,\u201d Scheer said.\n\nTrudeau embraced immigration at a time when the U.S. and other countries are closing their doors, and he legalized cannabis nationwide.\n\nHis efforts to strike a balance on the environment and the economy have been criticized by both the right and left. He brought in a carbon tax to fight climate change but rescued a stalled pipeline expansion project to get Alberta\u2019s oil to international markets.\n\nHis also negotiated a new free trade deal for Canada with the U.S. and Mexico amid threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to scrap it.\n\nPat Gill, a Vancouver retiree, said she voted for Trudeau.\n\n\u201cI think people know he\u2019s made some mistakes,\u201d said Gill, who is 74. \u201cI\u2019m hoping he\u2019s learned in the last four years. I still think he\u2019s our best bet.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press writer Jim Morris in Vancouver, British Columbia, contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation says Justin Trudeau's Liberals will hold on to the government.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/21/Canada_Election_35296.jpg-307d4_c0-155-4027-2504_s1200x700.jpg?a178e918aa9f6c114903c47f34eaef907098c834", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
