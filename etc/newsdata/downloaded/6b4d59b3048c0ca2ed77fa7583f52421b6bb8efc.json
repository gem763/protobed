Solar and wind power were the top two preferred alternative energy sources among both groups of respondents, while coal was ranked dead last.\n\nInsider's results align with other polling data on renewable energy. A Gallup poll from March found that Americans overwhelmingly favor expanding the production of green energy sources, particularly solar and wind. Around half also said they believed there should be less emphasis on coal power.\n\nThe use of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power has doubled in the last decade, according to the US Energy Information Administration, and federal and state policies combined with the declining cost of production drove much of the growth.\n\nNatural gas, which is a cleaner-burning fossil fuel, overtook coal as the nation's top source of electricity in 2016, highlighting the energy transition currently underway in the United States.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans strongly favor renewable sources of energy over fossil fuels\n\nInsider asked 1,090 respondents about which forms of energy they would want to power their neighborhood. The question: \"If cost were not an issue, which of the following types of power would you prefer to generate your area's electricity? Rank them in order of preference.\"\n\nTo determine Americans' overall preferences, Insider calculated the average ranking given by respondents to each type of energy. Here is how the data broke down, and other highlights:\n\nSolar power was the most preferred form of energy among all respondents with an average rank of 2.7. It drew a similar score among self-identified Democrats at 2.1, then one of 3.5 among self-identified Republicans.\n\nWind was the second-ranked energy source with an average score of 3.5 among all respondents. Meanwhile, self-identified Democrats ranked wind at 3, which was much more favorable than Republicans at 4.2.\n\nHydroelectric power ranked third among all respondents with an average of 4.1. It drew slightly more favorable attitudes among self-identified Democrats at 3.9, compared to Republicans at 4.3.\n\nGeothermal power was fourth among all respondents with an average rank of 4.7. It garnered a nearly identical score from self-identified Democrats and Republicans, at 4.6 and 4.8, respectively.\n\nNatural gas was the fifth-most preferred form of energy among all respondents with a rank of 4.8. Democrats ranked it at 5.2, though Republicans viewed natural gas more positively at 4.2.\n\nBiomass ranked sixth among all respondents with an average of 5.6. Among self-identified Democrats, it drew a score of 5.2. That was slightly more favorable than its score of 6 among self-identified Republicans.\n\nPetroleum was sixth among respondents at 6.1. That support was lower among Democrats at 6.7 but higher among Republicans at 5.3, suggesting a partisan gap on petroleum use.\n\nNuclear was seventh among all respondents with a rank of 6.1. The figure was almost identical among self-identified Democrats at 6.2 but it drew slightly more support among Republicans at 5.9.\n\nCoal was ranked dead-last among all respondents with an average rank of 7.4, indicating the public would rather turn to the other energy sources listed above. Self-identified Democrats scored it at 8.1, expressing a stronger unfavorable opinion of coal compared to self-identified Republicans at 6.8.\n\nInsider polling data backs up other trends of the public eager to adopt more renewable sources of energy, instead of continuing to rely on fossil fuels that pollute the Earth's atmosphere and contribute to climate change.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration has loosened environmental regulations and sought to open up more public lands to drilling, and in June it threw a lifeline to the struggling coal industry by easing restrictions on coal-burning power plants. The Energy Information Administration projects that it won't reverse coal's decline and that its share of electricity generation will be 22% in 2020.\n\nYet as the federal government pulls back from combating climate change under the Trump administration, states and cities are increasingly filling the void, setting the US in an opposite direction the public favors on reducing emissions and developing cleaner sources of energy.\n\nSurveyMonkey Audience polls from a national sample balanced by census data of age and gender.
