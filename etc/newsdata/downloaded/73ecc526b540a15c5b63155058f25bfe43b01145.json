I bet not,' said another.\n\nA third added: 'This is wrong on so many levels. It disgusts me.'", "description": "An extremely disgruntled Australian mother has slammed Kmart for selling a wedding dress 'costume' for six-year-old's this Halloween - saying it sends the wrong message about child brides.", "authors": ["Matilda Rudd For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/06/20021418-0-image-a-25_1571722862699.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
