A Turkish air strike in Ras al Ain killed 14 people including 10 civilians on Sunday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said. The SDF said a \u201ccivilian convoy\u201d had been targeted.\n\nAnkara\u2019s stated aim is to carve out a \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syria to resettle many of the 3.6 million Syrian war refugees it is hosting. Erdogan has threatened to send them to Europe if the EU does not back his assault.\n\nBut the Turkish offensive has triggered international alarm over its large-scale displacements of civilians and, amidst the upheaval, a heightened risk of Islamic State militants escaping from prisons run by the Kurdish-led authorities.\n\nSome 785 foreigners affiliated with Islamic State fled a camp where they were being held in northern Syria after shelling by Turkish forces on Sunday, the region\u2019s Kurdish-led administration said.\n\nErdogan dismissed the reports and told the state-run Anadolu news agency that accounts of escapes by Islamic State prisoners were \u201cdisinformation\u201d aimed at provoking the West.\n\nSANCTIONS THREAT\n\nTurkey now faces threats of possible sanctions from NATO ally the United States unless it calls off the incursion.\n\nTwo other NATO allies, Germany and France, have suspended arms exports to Turkey, and French President Emmanuel Macron was convening an emergency defense cabinet meeting on Sunday to discuss options regarding the offensive.\n\nA U.S. State Department spokesman said on Sunday that Washington was studying \u201cextremely troubling\u201d reports that a Kurdish politician and captured Kurdish fighters were killed by Turkish proxy forces amid the offensive.\n\nTurkey-backed Syrian rebel fighters are seen on a military vehicle in the town of Tal Abyad, Syria October 13, 2019. REUTERS/Khalil Ashawi\n\nMore than 130,000 people have been displaced from rural areas around Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain as a result of the fighting, the United Nations said on Sunday.\n\nThe planned evacuation of U.S. forces came a week after Trump spoke by telephone with Erdogan and then abruptly shifted policy and withdrew about 50 U.S. troops deployed to support Kurdish forces in the campaign against Islamic State.\n\n\u201cIn the last 24 hours, we learned that (the Turks) likely intend to extend their attack further south than originally planned, and to the west,\u201d Esper said in the interview with CBS. \u201cWe also have learned in the last 24 hours that the ... SDF are looking to cut a deal, if you will, with the Syrians and the Russians to counter-attack against the Turks in the north.\u201d\n\nSyrian state media reported that the Syrian army has begun deploying its troops to northern battlefronts to confront \u201cTurkish aggression\u201d on Syrian territory.\n\nEsper called the situation \u201cuntenable\u201d for U.S. forces, saying he spoke with Trump on Saturday night and that the president directed the U.S. military to \u201cbegin a deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern Syria\u201d.\n\nTERRITORIAL GAINS\n\nErdogan told reporters that Turkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies had besieged Tel Abyad, a key border town west of Ras al Ain. They later advanced into the center of Tel Abyad where the situation was calm and they were conducting search operations, a Reuters witness said.\n\nErdogan said Turkish-led forces had killed 440 SDF fighters so far and captured 109 square km (42 square miles) of terrain, including 17 villages around Tel Abyad and four villages around Ras Al Ain.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Anadolu news agency said the rebels seized complete control of Suluk, some 10 km (6 miles) from the border. But an SDF spokesman said its forces repelled the attack.\n\nSuluk is southeast of Tel Abyad, one of the two main targets in the incursion, which was bombarded by Turkish howitzers on Sunday afternoon, a witness in Akcakale said.\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian rebels, known as the National Army, advanced into Ras al Ain on Saturday but by Sunday there were still conflicting reports as to which side was in control.\n\nThe SDF, which hold large swathes of northern Syria that were once controlled by Islamic State, been keeping thousands of IS jihadists in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps. Western officials fear the Turkish offensive could free the militants and lead a resurgence of Islamic State.\n\n(Graphic: Where Kurds live - here)\n\nSlideshow (17 Images)\n\n(Graphic: Turkey hits Kurdish militia targets - here)", "description": "The United States said on Sunday it will withdraw its remaining 1,000 troops from northern Syria in the face of a Turkish offensive and Syria's army struck a deal with Kurdish forces to redeploy along its border with Turkey, both major victories for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.", "authors": ["Idrees Ali", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440424589&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0J2", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
