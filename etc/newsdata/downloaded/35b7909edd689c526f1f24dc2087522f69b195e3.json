Seems that in Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party they'd rather abolish you than debate with you.\"\n\nThe NEC, Labour's governing body, will vote again on abolishing Mr Watson's post at the party's annual conference at 10:00 BST on Saturday.\n\nSources told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg they expected the vote to be passed.\n\nThere will then be a vote on the conference floor in the afternoon, where it is expected the bid will be approved, ousting Mr Watson.\n\nBBC political reporter Jessica Parker said Mr Watson's supporters were \"not overly optimistic\" that he will win Saturday's vote.\n\nLabour MP Wes Streeting said in a Twitter post the push to oust Mr Watson \"isn't just outrageous, it's self destructive\".\n\n\"Labour Conference this week needs to put the Party on a general election footing - talking to the country about our vision for Britain,\" he wrote.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @wesstreeting Labour Conference this week needs to put the Party on a general election footing - talking to the country about our vision for Britain. For @jonlansman and @PeoplesMomentum to try and remove our Deputy Leader @tom_watson isn\u2019t just outrageous, it\u2019s self-destructive and must stop. \u2014 Wes Streeting MP (@wesstreeting) September 20, 2019 Report\n\nLabour MP Jess Phillips tweeted: \"Wish that we could just stop pretending & say what we think... There's a desperate attempt to control & expel anyone who has an independent thought.\n\n\"I'm so sick of pretending just say you hate Tom Watson just be honest.\"\n\nAnd former Labour leader Ed Miliband tweeted that those who had come up with the idea to abolish the deputy leader post had \"taken leave of their senses\".", "description": "The move will be debated at Labour's conference on Saturday and sources expect the attempt to succeed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1230D/production/_108890547_watson2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
