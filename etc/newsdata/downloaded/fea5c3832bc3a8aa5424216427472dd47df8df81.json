In its 1Q 2020 statement on Sept. 17, the company slashed its profit forecast for the year as a worsening economic environment, triggered by the U.S.-China trade spat, took its toll on the company\u2019s Express delivery business \u2014 which is widely considered a proxy for the global economy.\n\nThe Memphis, Tennessee-based transportation giant now expects per-share earnings to fall between 16-29% in the current fiscal year, compared with the forecast of a mid-single-digit percentage decline issued in June. FedEx also lowered its revenue outlook.\n\nBlaming increasing trade tensions and policy uncertainty, Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith said in a conference call: \u201cThe global economy continues to soften and we are taking steps to cut capacity.\u201d\n\nThe profit warning comes after the company posted an 11% drop in fiscal first-quarter profit, driven by the Express unit's weakness, which delivers packages by jet and is especially vulnerable to global trade disruption.\n\nOminous Sign for Industrial Stocks\n\nThat continuing drag sent FedEx shares tumbling yesterday, falling almost 13% to $150.91, their lowest level in more than two years. The stock is down about 45% from the record high it reached in early 2018 when it hit $274.66 a share.\n\n\n\n\n\nFedex price chart\n\nThe deepening slump in FedEx shares is also an ominous sign for other industrial stocks, such as Caterpillar Inc (NYSE: ). and Deere & Company (NYSE: ), as the lingering slowdown in global economic activity could further hurt their sales and delay the recovery.\n\nBut investors should remember that in an environment of economic uncertainties like the current one, blaming everything on the economy is a tactic many CEOs use to hide the internal issues. In the case of FedEx, there are also several other triggers for this dismal performance.\n\nThe biggest one is the company\u2019s continuing troubles at its European business after its of TNT in 2015. That deal is still very much a work-in-progress that has failed to unlock the value investors were hoping to see.\n\nFedEx said in March the integration costs for the acquisition are expected to exceed $1.5 billion through fiscal 2021, with the potential of further escalation. The integration challenges and the slowing European economy have raised doubts about the benefits of the TNT deal, with some analysts questioning the wisdom behind this massive undertaking.\n\nAfter Q1 earnings on Wednesday, analysts from Stifel, BMO, Deutsche Bank and KeyBanc downgraded the stock, putting into question any hopes of a swift turnaround. Deutsche Bank said in a note it has lowered the rating on the the stock to \u2018hold\u2019 from \u2018buy\u2019 and cut its target price to $142 from $178 because:\n\n\"While some may view this as the bottom in shares, we don\u2019t see any support until management takes responsibility for recent performance and clearly articulates a credible path to better results and cash flow (and delivers on it). In the meantime shares will continue to melt lower, and rightfully so.\u201d\n\nWith the softening economy, FedEx has also been restructuring its operations to cope with the rise of e-commerce orders. It recently ended is contract with Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and announced plans to offer seven-day home delivery and to handle more of the packages it used to route through the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFedEx\u2019s outlook on weakening world trade and the economy cements our view that investors should stay away from buying stocks closely tied with the global economy. It\u2019s tough to see a bottom in FedEx stock as it faces so many headwinds, including macro weakness, issues related to TNT integration and a huge cost escalation. These negative factors will continue to put pressure on the company\u2019s cash flows and sharply diminish the chances for higher dividends.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Investing.com (Haris Anwar/Investing.com) covering: Caterpillar Inc, Deere & Company, FedEx Corporation, Amazon.com Inc.
