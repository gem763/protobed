Not fun. Lots of blood.\u2019\n\nGiving her fans some sound advice, she added: \u2018Just a reminder to be careful while handling knives.\u2019\n\nAs worried followers began to hound her for an update after she revealed the horrible injury, she\u2019s now taken to social media to set the record straight after trying to appease us with updates over the weekend.\n\nTurns out she\u2019s on the mend and we can all go back to our day now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSharing a cute cartoon drawing of what her toe might look like IRL, the 26-year-old doodled her digit with a big smile on its face.\n\n\u2018I see lots of questions about my toe so here it is today,\u2019 she wrote, with a winking emoji.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s definitely getting better and I\u2019m totally fine so no need to worry.\u2019\n\nOuch (Picture: Instagram)\n\nShe added sweetly: \u2018Thank you all for the concern\u2019.\n\nEarlier on over the weekend she tried to let us know she was fine as she wrote: \u2018Thank you all for worrying about the toe. It is a very dark purple colour near the cut, so it\u2019s not looking pretty BUT I\u2019ve been able to walk all day so I assume it\u2019s not that serious. I\u2019m hoping it will heal on its own.\u2019\n\nDon\u2019t handle knives, to be on the safe side (Picture: itsmarziapie)\n\nTerrifying knife accidents aside, the pair seem to be having a blast in Japan, which is where they got engaged back in 2018.\n\nMarzia shared some stunning snaps of the streets of Tokyo, the gorgeous landscape at night, as well as a couple of her new husband.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m enjoying experiencing autumn in Tokyo for the first time\u2026it is much warmer than you would expect!\u2019 she wrote.\n\nMeanwhile 29-year-old Pewds \u2013 real name Felix Kjellberg \u2013 showed off his silly side as he got his groove on with a street performer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolding a ragged Barbie doll, the YouTuber danced along with a performer who appeared to be creating some sort of illusion as he wore a \u2018wind-swept\u2019 tie.\n\nLaughter could be heard in the background as Felix slowly danced towards the performer, who dramatically lunged at the doll, which looked a little worse for wear, and embraced it.\n\nIt seems the pair are having a blast on their second honeymoon after they tied the knot at London\u2019s Kew Gardens a month ago.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
