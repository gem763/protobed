Turkish forces first launched their assault after Mr Trump withdrew all US troops from the border.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan's operation aims to push Kurdish fighters - regarded by Turkey as terrorists - away from northernmost Syria and create a \"safe zone\" for resettling up to two million Syrian refugees currently in Turkey.\n\nBetween 160,000 and 300,000 people have reportedly fled their homes since the fighting started, and there are fears that the Turkish operation may lead to the ethnic cleansing of the local Kurdish population.\n\nConcern was also growing about possible war crimes committed by Turkey and allied militias since the offensive began on 9 October. Unconfirmed reports suggest that Turkish forces have used white phosphorus, a chemical weapon, in Syria.\n\nWhat did Mitch McConnell say?\n\nIn his opinion piece in the Washington Post, Mr McConnell - as Senate majority leader one of the most senior members of Mr Trump's Republican party - attacked the US troop withdrawal as a \"grave strategic mistake\".\n\n\"The combination of a US pullback and the escalating Turkish-Kurdish hostilities is creating a strategic nightmare for our country,\" he wrote. Even if the ceasefire held, the Turkish assault and US withdrawal had \"set back\" Washington's fight against the Islamic State (IS) group.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Mr McConnell says the US troop withdrawal will allow Russia and Iran to expand their influence in the region\n\nMr McConnell says the US \"retreat\" will allow both Russian and Iranian influence to grow in the region.\n\nThe Kentucky senator suggests using \"both sticks and carrots to bring Turkey back in line while respecting its own legitimate security concerns\", as well as maintaining a \"limited military presence\" in Syria and work closely with allies in the Middle East \"threatened by this chaos\".\n\nMr McConnell did not mention Donald Trump by name in the article.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Trump called the situation in the region \"strategically brilliant\" for the US.\n\n\"They have a problem at a border,\" he told reporters at the White House. \"It's not our border. We shouldn't be losing lives over it.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption President Donald Trump exchange with reporter over troops withdrawal\n\nMr McConnell is the latest Republican to criticise the president over Syria. Senator Lindsey Graham - normally a staunch ally of Mr Trump's - has vociferously opposed the administration's troop withdrawal.\n\n\"A buffer zone is acceptable to the Kurds but a military occupation that displaces hundreds of thousands is not a safe zone,\" Mr Graham said on Thursday after speaking to Kurdish forces. \"It is ethnic cleansing.\"\n\nWhat's happening on the ground?\n\nMustafa Bali, a spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), tweeted on Friday morning that Turkey was breaking the ceasefire near the flashpoint border town of Ras al-Ain.\n\n\"Despite the agreement to halt the fighting, air and artillery attacks continue to target the positions of fighters, civilian settlements and the hospital,\" he wrote.\n\nPresident Erdogan dismissed reports of continuing clashes on Friday as \"misinformation\" but international news media recorded explosions in Ras al-Ain during the morning.\n\nThe Kurds had agreed to cease firing in the area between Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad, where combat had been fierce, but they said other areas had not been discussed.\n\nThe Turkish-declared pause followed talks in Ankara between Mr Erdogan and Mr Trump's Vice-President, Mike Pence, on Thursday.\n\nAll fighting was to halt for five days, or 120 hours, and the US was to help facilitate the withdrawal of Kurdish-led troops from Turkey's \"safe zone\" along the border.\n\nMr Erdogan said on Friday that Syrian Kurdish fighters had begun to withdraw but Turkish forces would stay in north-eastern Turkey to make sure they \"truly leave\".\n\nThe Turkish president also told reporters that his forces would restart their assault \"the minute 120 hours are over\" if Kurdish fighters have not left the area by the end of the ceasefire.\n\nWere war crimes committed?\n\nNearly 500 people have been killed since the offensive started, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group.\n\nThey included 224 members of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and 183 Turkish-backed rebels, but also 72 civilians, according to the SOHR. The dead reportedly included at least 20 Turkish civilians.\n\nReports in some newspapers alleged that Turkish forces used white phosphorus in Syria. People exposed to the chemical are badly burned, as moisture on the body makes the chemical burn more vigorously while the heavy smoke it emits damages the lungs.\n\nTurkey insisted it did not have the weapon in its arsenal, but some Kurds forces accused militias fighting alongside Turkish forces of deploying it.\n\nA spokesman for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said on Friday the group had \"not yet determined the credibility of these allegations\", but was aware of the situation and collecting information.\n\nAmnesty International says it has gathered \"damning evidence of war crimes and other violations by Turkish forces and their allies\".\n\nIt accuses them of carrying out summary executions and attacking civilians indiscriminately.\n\nHevrin Khalaf, a Kurdish female politician killed on 12 October, was dragged out of her car, beaten and shot dead by Turkish-backed Syrian fighters, Amnesty says.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption A portrait of Hevrin Khalaf (L) appeared along with one of a dead Kurdish fighter, Sehid Rojinda Qendil, at a protest rally in Beirut\n\nIn other attacks, children were killed by Turkish air strikes or mortars, Amnesty says.\n\nTurkish-backed fighters have denied responsibility for Khalaf's death. President Erdogan insists his operation is aimed at bringing peace to the region and should be welcomed internationally.", "description": "Republican Mitch McConnell calls Turkey's Syria offensive and the US troop withdrawal a \"nightmare\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4091/production/_109292561_tv057387027.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
