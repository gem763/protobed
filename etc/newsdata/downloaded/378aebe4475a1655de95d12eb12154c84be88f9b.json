The total number of women who claimed they had been harassed by him ballooned to dozens in the months after his ouster. PBS also cut ties with Rose.", "description": "Gina Riggi claims she and her colleagues were targeted by Rose\u2019s \u201cexplicit sexual overtures\u201d during their time working on two of his talk shows.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8635732100005b00e7a7a4.jpeg?cache=st45bgz2rf&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
