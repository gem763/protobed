(Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nOf all the ups and downs (and downs and downs) of almost three years of the Trump administration, the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court remains one of the most painful. For feminists, the fact that Kavanaugh was confirmed in the face of credible allegations of sexual assault was more evidence that, despite #MeToo and a resurgent women\u2019s movement, the country hasn\u2019t changed since the days of Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill. For conservatives blindsided by the accusations, victory was bittersweet, marred by the conviction that a decent man can have his reputation ruined by mere allegations. The Senate hearings in the fall of 2018 were watched, and carried out, by two groups of Americans who couldn\u2019t have seen them more differently.\n\nIt\u2019s this messy middle that New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly dig into in \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d a thoroughly reported look at how those hectic, divisive autumn weeks came to be.\n\nThere is plenty in their reporting that is alternately heartbreaking and rage-inducing. Christine Blasey Ford, who seemingly came out of nowhere to testify about an incident when, she said, Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were both teenagers, is reconstructed as neither feminist hero nor vengeful villain; she is, instead, a human woman who had previously recounted her painful story to a handful of intimates, who tried to remain anonymous until it became impossible, and who struggled with whether and how to come forward. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, broadly portrayed at the time as an inept manager of Ford\u2019s story, is seen in hindsight as a concerned public servant to two competing masters: her desire to ensure that the accusations were investigated, and Ford\u2019s plea for anonymity.\n\nBut most striking is Deborah Ramirez, a classmate of Kavanaugh\u2019s at Yale whose story \u2014 she said he pulled out his penis and put it in her face at a party \u2014 was reported on but rapidly sidelined during the hasty confirmation process. Pogrebin and Kelly do what the FBI didn\u2019t bother to do: They talk to a wide variety of Kavanaugh\u2019s and Ramirez\u2019s Yale contemporaries and find multiple people who corroborate Ramirez\u2019s account.\n\nThey also find several people who say Kavanaugh was a stand-up guy, a frat boy for sure but a virgin who treated women with respect. Many of Kavanaugh\u2019s friends see a politically motivated takedown, not a search for the truth. And certainly his wife, who at one point had to flee their home because of death threats, is collateral damage in a battle she never chose to fight.\n\nBut today, Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court and goes home every night to his family, while Ford\u2019s life has never quite returned to what it was.\n\nLike many Americans, I watched the Kavanaugh hearings as they happened, if on a few hours\u2019 delay \u2014 that autumn I was reporting in Colombia, working on a story about abortion access for rape survivors. I interviewed women who had been raped in their country\u2019s civil war, who decided on that particular day that yes, they were willing to sit down with a strange woman from a foreign country and talk about the worst day (or for many of them, days) of their lives. After the war ended and the peace process began, many of the women, like many others in Colombia, reported what they had lost and sought compensation: land, children, husbands, brothers, sisters. Very few of the women I talked to, though, reported being raped. It was a big thing, the shame. And the rape, they convinced themselves \u2014 they were told, explicitly or implicitly \u2014 was a small thing. Who were you to complain when you survived it? When so many people lost things that were real and tangible \u2014 the land of one\u2019s ancestors, the warm body of a loved one \u2014 isn\u2019t it outrageous to suggest that in rape, something just as valuable was lost as well?\n\nIt was on one of those days \u2014 I can\u2019t remember exactly which, but I think it was the same day one of the women I interviewed took off her shirt so that Nicki, the photographer I work with, could capture an image of the bullet hole that scarred the skin near her breast (there were a lot of days, and a lot of scars, and a lot of women) \u2014 in any case, it was at the end of one or another or maybe another of those days that Nicki and I went back to our hotel room and pulled up C-SPAN on YouTube and watched Ford and Kavanaugh testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n\u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh\u201d is a book about what happened. It doesn\u2019t seek clear answers so much as attempt to write the first iteration of this particular historical record. It even ends with a quote from the Aeneid: \u201cSomeday it will be helpful to have recalled even these events.\u201d Living in the minutiae, and maintaining that focus on narrating events rather than opining on or analyzing them, makes this book a remarkable work of slowed-down journalism. At the end, the authors break that journalistic equivalent of the fourth wall and offer their own impressions: \u201cUltimately,\u201d they write, \u201cwe combined our notebooks with our common sense and came to believe an utterly human narrative: that Ford and Ramirez were mistreated by Kavanaugh as a teenager, and that Kavanaugh over the next thirty-five years became a better person.\u201d What impact this conclusion should have on Kavanaugh\u2019s judgeship, they say, is not for them to weigh.\n\nBut perhaps that\u2019s the wrong question. In the origin story of each of Kavanaugh\u2019s achievements is a hand up, usually extended by another man. He attends a prestigious high school because his parents can afford it. He is not remembered as a particularly brilliant student nor a particularly political one; he is a blank slate whom few seemed to know well outside of partying and sports. His grades were good, but there are no stories of virtuosity, just a heavy-drinking, clean-cut young man who seemed to be the median kind of person at an elite university like Yale in the 1980s.\n\nBut he was born and bred in a universe of privilege and access, and then afforded opportunities and the benefit of the doubt from men who looked like him. Among them: Circuit Court Judge Alex Kozinski, for whom Kavanaugh clerked, and who was eventually felled by accusations of pervasive and blatant harassment and assault of female clerks and employees, including showing them explicit pornographic images and circulating such images on an email list. Kozinski and Kavanaugh wrote a book together and spoke on the same panels; Kozinski also helped screen clerks for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy and invited Kavanaugh to assist him. Kavanaugh got the clerkship in the first place because he played basketball with Yale law professor George L. Priest, whom Kozinski called for a clerk recommendation. Priest suggested Kavanaugh, who wasn\u2019t a hugely impressive student, \u201cbut I got to know his character from basketball,\u201d Priest told Pogrebin and Kelly. Once Kavanaugh was a judge himself, he hired Kozinski\u2019s son as a clerk, despite the junior Kozinski\u2019s mediocre grades.\n\nKavanaugh made and remade himself in the image of these men, and so despite being good but not wildly special, he was eventually elevated to the height of his profession.\n\nThis is only a small part of the larger story Pogrebin and Kelly are trying to tell. But from their excavation of the simple \u201cwhat happened?\u201d come more complicated questions. How does power replicate itself, and how do the already powerful hoard it and pass it on to those who, by virtue of gender and race and social position, remind these powerful men of younger versions of themselves? Why do we call this meritocracy? Whose testimony do we take as evidence, and whose becomes a mere \u201cshe said\u201d? The life-shifting memory of an attempted rape, the lifelong goal of a Supreme Court seat \u2014 which is the smaller thing, and can you even weigh these things on the same scale?\n\nIs credibility a story told in careful tones? Or does it hinge on proof \u2014 or at least the willingness to peel everything off and show a scar to a stranger?\n\nThis, Pogrebin and Kelly are clear, is outside their paygrade. But the power in this book is the authors\u2019 effort to use their journalistic tools to set the foundation for the reader to consider these bigger, broader questions. The authors try to wrap it up in a way that feels narrow and humble, not straying too far out of their professional lane. They are doing their jobs as journalists and writing the first draft of history.
