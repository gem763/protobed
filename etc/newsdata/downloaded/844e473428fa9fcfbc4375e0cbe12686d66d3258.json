But Russian authorities appear to be using Issachar as a form of collateral in a different diplomatic dispute involving Israel and the US. Israel President Benjamin Netanyahu has advocated for Issachar's release but discouraged the Russian proposal of a prisoner swap.\n\nThe prisoner in question is a Russian IT specialist named Aleksey Burkov who was arrested in December 2015 at an Israel airport. He is wanted in the US on charges of hacking and credit card fraud, and Israel's Supreme Court approved the US extradition request in August.\n\nfacebook free naama More\n\nFacebook/#WeWantNaama\n\nIn a statement, Netanyahu said Issachar's sentence \"is disproportionate and does not fit the nature of the offense being attributed.\" The Israeli president also said he discussed the matter with Russian President Vladimir Putin in September, at a meeting in Sochi.\n\nCNN reported that Burkov's family has raised the possibility of a prisoner swap with Issachar on Russian state TV. Netanyahu seemed to express interest in that possibility, stating that Israel's judicial authorities have made it \"unequivocally clear that there is no possibility of preventing the extradition of Burkov following the Supreme Court ruling that he is subject to extradition.\"\n\nRead more: Trump hosting the G-7 at his Miami Doral resort is an 'extraordinary' breach of norms that could violate the constitution, experts say\n\nWhile the Israeli Supreme Court has approved the US extradition request for Burkov, Russia has also submitted its own extradition request for the IT specialist, which has not been approved, according to Israeli media outlets. Burkov is currently being held in prison in Israel and could remain there while Israeli authorities argue for Issachar's release.\n\nIsraeli Justice Minister Amir Ohana told Israeli media outlets that swapping the prisoners would create a \"dangerous precedent.\" Ohana said he will sign the order to extradite Burkov to the US \"very soon.\"\n\nIssachar's family members reportedly claim her prison conditions are worse than what other prisoners experience, and say she is not able to send or receive letters. In comparison to Issachar, a New York college student pleaded guilty to possessing just over 19 grams of medicinal marijuana in a Russian airport in September and was only required to pay a $235 fine.\n\nNOW WATCH: How Area 51 became the center of alien conspiracy theories", "description": "Naama Issachar, 26, was sentenced to 7.5 years of prison in Moscow, and negotiating her release is part of a bigger diplomatic dispute.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZeVY_IPFOo2lpeTNeUMLtg--~B/aD0xMDM2O3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/6f560545551e287331b66a6b0df200b9", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
