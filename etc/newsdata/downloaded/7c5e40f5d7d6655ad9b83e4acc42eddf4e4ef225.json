Bush at a football game.\n\nWhat happened to DeGeneres is a sign of how stupid and low our nasty partisan politics are.\n\nLiberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican, you can't be seen in public with someone from the other political tribe without catching hell or hate from your own tribe.\n\nThose kids I was with at the library were too young to know it, but there was a time before Twitter, Facebook and 1,000 cable TV channels when the most powerful people in politics could disagree vehemently yet still be civil to each other.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of that political civility and mutual respect was the relationship my father had with the Democrat Speaker of the House, Tip O'Neill.\n\nNot as well-known was the time my father was asked in 1985 to give a fundraising speech for the John F. Kennedy Library.\n\nIn 1960 my father had campaigned hard against JFK. But when he was president and he was asked by John and Caroline Kennedy to help them kick off an endowment drive for the JFK Library, he did it graciously and enthusiastically.\n\nPraising JFK for being, among many other things, \"a patriot\" who had \"a good hard, un-illusioned understanding of man and his political choices,\" my father admitted he had not supported Kennedy for president.\n\n\"But you know,\" he said, \"it's true: when the battle's over and the ground is cooled, well, it's then that you see the opposing general's valor.\"\n\nThat kind of civility being shown to a political opponent could never happen today in Washington, where Democrats and Republicans hate each other, call each other bad names and refuse to cooperate or compromise.\n\nAs for our kids today, they're being taught by the bad example of adults to hate the political tribe they don't belong to. It's reinforced 24/7 on TV, in social media and college campuses.\n\nIf we're not careful we're going to end up like Israel, where the Palestinian kids and the Israeli kids don't play with each other and are raised from infancy to hate each other.\n\nMaybe there's still time for our children to turn to their parents and tell them it's time for them to grow up and stop hating.", "description": "A Jeb Bush tweet this week got me thinking about .10/11/2019 15:37:03PM EST.", "authors": ["Michael Reagan", "Katie Pavlich", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/137/27f21e15-0b18-4fe2-8f93-095551b18799.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
