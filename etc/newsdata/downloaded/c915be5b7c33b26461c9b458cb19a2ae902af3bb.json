It\u2019s an amazing story,\u201d Medvedev said. \u201cAll this summer is amazing for me. I will remember every moment of it.\u201d\n\nThe 23-year-old Russian was humorous during his postmatch remarks, providing a little more entertainment to a crowd that had already been treated to 4 hours, 50 minutes of it during a riveting match that seemed would be over much, much earlier.\n\nNadal had won the first sets and then broke Medvedev\u2019s serve for a 3-2 lead in the third. Nobody had come back to win from two sets down in the U.S. Open final in 70 years, and Nadal had lost only once in a Grand Slam tournament when he had that lead.\n\nBut Medvedev kept fighting, aided by a crowd inside Arthur Ashe Stadium that wanted to stay a little longer.\n\nTurns out, they stayed a lot longer.\n\n\u201cAmazing performance and he will learn from this to be stronger and stronger,\u201d said Gilles Cervara, Medvedev\u2019s coach. \u201cIt was a great match. We are very disappointed because we felt that he could do it finally in the fifth set.\u201d\n\nMedvedev broke Nadal\u2019s serve in the final game of both the third and fourth sets, and even when it seemed he was out of it in the fifth he refused to give in easily. He broke when Nadal served for the match at 5-2, and had another chance to break in the final game before Nadal finally closed it out.\n\nBy then, some fans were even chanting Medvedev\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cI was fighting for every point. I think they appreciated it,\u201d Medvedev said.\n\n\u201cI knew I have to leave my heart out there for them, also. For myself first of all, but for them, also. I think they saw it and they appreciate it.\u201d\n\nHe then had fans standing and cheering with his remarks during the trophy ceremony - a far cry from his third-round match , when one fan was seen on camera extending his middle finger toward him. Medvedev had drawn their ire for a series of antics on the court, first snatching the towel from a ballperson, then tossing his racket in the direction of the chair umpire, and finally flashing his middle finger next to his forehead.\n\nWhen Medvedev trolled them during his postmatch interview that night, arms extended to encourage more boos, he seemed to assure himself a permanent place - at least for the rest of this tournament - on the fans\u2019 list of players they love to hate.\n\nBut he was contrite afterward and vowed to be a better person.\n\nHe\u2019s already a good player. Medvedev reached the final of four straight hard-court tournaments to move into the top five in the rankings, with his performance at Flushing Meadows his best by far in a major.\n\n\u201cTonight everybody saw why he\u2019s the No. 4 player in the world already although he\u2019s 23 years old,\u201d Nadal said.\n\nSo though Medvedev said he tends to be critical of himself, he had to agree with his new fans that applauded a job well done.\n\n\u201cHave to give myself credit,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope I grew a lot doing these things. But I need to continue and I need to be better.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Brian Mahoney on Twitter at https://twitter.com/briancmahoney\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Imagine this a week ago: U.S. Open fans going crazy for Daniil Medvedev.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brian Mahoney"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/us_open_tennis_16800_c0-229-4928-3102_s1770x1032.jpg?7b03c461ddd68b1eb6d2a438aa14a53d2e25ded1", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
