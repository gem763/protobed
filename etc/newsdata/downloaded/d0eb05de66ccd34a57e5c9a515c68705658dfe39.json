Panels and seminars presented by attending schools will offer unique expert insights into the admission and application process.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo enable attendees to fully contextualise the role of a postgraduate qualification within their career path, a professional career coach will offer career advice and feedback on CVs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumni from prominent postgraduate programs will also attend to share their experiences and insights with the future candidates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe events are free to attend, with registration open online.\n\nWorld Grad School Tour\n\nMonday November 18th, 15:00-20:00\n\nwww.topuniversities.com/manila\n\nQS World MBA Tour\n\nTuesday November 19th, 16:30 -- 21:00\n\nwww.topmba.com/manila\n\nMakati Shangri-la, Ayala Avenue\n\n1.Data from the QS Jobs & Salary Trends Report 2018\n\n2 Data from the QS World University Rankings 2020 and QS World MBA Rankings 2020\n\n\n\n", "description": "International Masters and MBA programs to attend Philippine events LONDON, UK - Media OutReach - October 25, 2019 - As the job market becomes ever more competitive, more and more employers are looking at postgraduate qualifications to distinguish candidates from the crowd.
