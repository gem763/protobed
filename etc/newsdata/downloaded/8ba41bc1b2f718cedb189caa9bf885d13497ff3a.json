The fate of a record-long expansion depends on them.\n\nBy most measures, the economy is slowing. Manufacturers are struggling. Exports have fallen. Business investment is down. And fewer people are being hired.\n\nRead: U.S. creates just 130,000 new jobs in August, keeping Fed on track to cut rates\n\nA recession, however, still appears far off thanks to steady spending by American households. Consumers account for about 70% of what goes on in the economy.\n\nRising demand for goods and services has deterred companies from resorting to layoffs even as they face mounting financial and other pressures. What\u2019s also discouraged them is the tightest labor market in decades.\n\nGood employees are already hard enough to find. Why fire experienced workers and face the daunting prospect of replacing them if the economy suddenly speeds up again? That\u2019s the dilemma some companies face.\n\nRead: For the first time in 11 years, 80% of Americans in their prime are working\n\nWhat\u2019s a thorny issue for executives, however, is good for the economy.\n\nAs long as layoffs stay low and the labor market is tight, consumers are likely to remain confident and spend like they normally do. And that should be enough to allow an expansion that recently entered a record 11th year to carry on for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, for its part, is prepared to step in at the first hint of trouble. The central bank cut interest rates at the end of July and is widely expected to do so again this month.\n\n\u201cU.S. recession risks remain elevated, but we are clearly not there yet,\u201d said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West.\n\nWall Street will get another glimpse into Americans\u2019 spending ways with the August report on retail sales. Sales of new cars and trucks were strong last month, but gasoline prices fell.\n\nSee: MarketWatch Economic Calendar\n\nThe divergent paths of two of the biggest retail segments could lead to a so-so sales figure, but there\u2019s been little evidence of a drop-off in consumer spending. With the holidays coming up, it\u2019s also hard to see the bottom falling out before the end of the year.\n\nIn ordinary times a trio of reports on inflation, including the consumer-price index, would take center stage. Yet inflation has hovered below 2% for the past year and the Federal Reserve is all but certain to cut interest rates in two weeks, part of its inoculation strategy in case the trade war with China threatens the U.S. expansion.\n\nEven a sharp uptick in inflation, what\u2019s more, won\u2019t alarm senior Fed officials like it might have in the past given the persistently low readings.\n\n\u201cMost Fed officials appear to have reverted to a \u2018whites of their eyes\u2019 approach to inflation,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist of Amherst Pierpont Securities.\n\n", "description": "The big story to watch for the U.S. economy \u2014 really the only story \u2014 is the action of consumers.
