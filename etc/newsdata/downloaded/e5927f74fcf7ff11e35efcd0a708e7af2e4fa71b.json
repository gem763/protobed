In the past year, the value of the nation\u2019s gold jumped 42% to $109.5 billion and the metal now makes up the biggest share of Russia\u2019s total reserves since 2000.\n\nRussia\u2019s central bank has been the largest buyer of gold in the past few years as President Vladimir Putin seeks to break reliance on the U.S. dollar as relations between the countries remain strained. If Russia did need to tap its gold holding, it would fetch a hefty price -- the metal is heading for the best year since 2010 as the U.S.-China trade war hurts global growth and central banks ease monetary policy.\n\n\u201cRussia prefers to cushion its macroeconomic stability through politically neutral tools,\u201d said Vladimir Miklashevsky, a strategist at Danske Bank A/S in Helsinki. \u201cThere is a massive substitution of U.S. dollar assets by gold -- a strategy which has earned billions of dollars for the Bank of Russia just within several months.\u201d\n\nRussia isn\u2019t alone in hoarding gold. China, Kazakhstan and Poland have been among the biggest buyers in the past couple of years, and global holdings are expected to increase for a while yet.\n\nNot all of Russia\u2019s moves are paying off. Last year, the central bank shifted about $100 billion of U.S. holdings into euros, yuan and the yen, and since then the Chinese currency has dropped. Russia also missed out on the rally in U.S. Treasuries.\n\nRussia may keep buying gold to compensate for those other losses in its reserves, said Kirill Tremasov, a former Economics Ministry official and now director of analysis at Loko-Invest in Moscow. So far it\u2019s working, with gold up 18% this year to $1,508 an ounce.\n\nFor Russia at least, it\u2019s more about diversification than benefiting from the price. The central bank started buying gold more than a decade ago as it rallied toward 2011\u2018s record, and kept adding when prices dropped in the following few years.\n\n\u201cThe central bank is unlikely to have pursued the goal of earning in the process of managing gold reserves,\u201d Dmitry Dolgin, an economist at ING Bank, said by email. \u201cThe buying was rather about diversification of assets.\u201d", "description": "Russia\u2019s Massive Gold Stash Is Now Worth More Than $100 Billion", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic506c5039f2430ed7fa43afb60cdeffa5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
