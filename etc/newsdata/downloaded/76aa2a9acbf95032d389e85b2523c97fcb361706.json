A temporary monitor was hired to oversee the company's activity, according to the FTC.\n\n\u201cFrom start to finish, these defendants used the promise of easy money and in-depth information to lure consumers down a path that could cost them thousands of dollars and put them in serious debt,\u201d said Andrew Smith, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. \u201cWhen a company tells consumers they have the secret to get rich with little work, we encourage consumers to take a hard look at what\u2019s really being offered.\u201d\n\nIn an emailed statement to FOX Business, A Zurixx spokesperson said the company is proceeding with normal business, despite reports that they had been ordered to halt operations.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"Zurixx has always been, and will remain, a positive, compliant and student-focused business in the marketing, selling and delivering of our education products,\" the statement reads. \"We are aware of the formal inquiry by the FTC and the State of Utah, we welcome the scrutiny and anticipate a positive outcome as we work directly and openly with the agencies involved.\u201d\n\nZurixx curates \u201cfree comprehensive educational events, three-day workshops, advanced training camps, summits, coaching and mentorship programs in the areas of business growth and management, asset protection, real estate and personal finances,\u201d according to the company\u2019s website.\n\nBut at the events, attendees would be asked to pay for another three-day class that cost $1,997.
