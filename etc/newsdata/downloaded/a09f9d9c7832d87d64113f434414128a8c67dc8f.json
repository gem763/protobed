Her book, \u201cThe Matriarch: Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty,\u201d published in April 2019, is a New York Times best seller. She is currently writing a biography of Nancy Pelosi, titled \u201cMadam Speaker.\u201d\n\nEstablished in 1976, the Alumnae Award is given each year to a woman who has made outstanding professional contributions in her field and who has attained national recognition. Renowned educators, journalists, doctors, scientists, and artists are included among the Northwestern University alumnae who have previously received the prestigious award.\n\n\u201cThe Alumnae of Northwestern University is proud to present the 2019 Alumnae Award to Susan Page,\u201d said Alumnae Award committee co-chairs Mary Schuette and Susie Stein. \u201cShe joins a distinguished group of women from such diverse fields as business, education, music, medicine, science, theater, and public service, bringing honor to Northwestern University.\u201d\n\nPage began her remarkable career in journalism during her school years at Southeast High School in Wichita, Kansas. She received a bachelor\u2019s degree from Northwestern University, where she was editor-in-chief of The Daily Northwestern. She received a master\u2019s degree from Columbia University, where she was a Pulitzer Fellow.\n\n\u201cMy debt to Northwestern is deep,\u201d Page said. \u201cAs a journalist, I\u2019ve been struck by the number of women in positions of leadership in my field who are also graduates of Northwestern \u2013 for instance, my fellow Washington Bureau chiefs Elizabeth Bumiller of The New York Times and Julie Pace of The Associated Press. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an accident. My years in Evanston broadened my horizons in ways I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I moved into Shepard Hall my freshman year \u2013 the first time I had ever spent a night outside my native state of Kansas. To return to Evanston to receive this award is an honor I will treasure.\u201d\n\nPage has served as president of the White House Correspondents Association and president of the Gridiron Club, the oldest association of journalists in Washington. She has been a juror for the Pulitzer Prizes and is a member of the Attorney General\u2019s media advisory group.\n\nPage has won every journalism award given specifically for coverage of the White House. She received the Merriman Smith Memorial Award for presidential news coverage, the Aldo Beckman Memorial Award for journalistic excellence, the Gerald R Ford Prize for Distinguished Reporting on the Presidency (twice), and the Sigma Delta Chi Distinguished Service Award for Washington Correspondence (shared). She is also the recipient of the American News Women\u2019s Club 2017 Excellence in Journalism Award.\n\nPage will receive The Alumnae of Northwestern University\u2019s 2019 Alumnae Award at a ceremony that will be held at Evanston\u2019s Orrington Hotel on Thursday, October 17, 2019, from 3:30-5:30 p.m. and is open to the public.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/pr/2019/10/16/page-washington-bureau-chief-usa-today-named-recipient-alumnae-northwestern-universitys-2019-alumnae/4003211002/", "description": "Page, Washington Bureau chief of USA TODAY, was named the recipient of The Alumnae of Northwestern University\u2019s 2019 Alumnae Award.", "authors": ["Usa Today Network Press Room", "Published P.M.
