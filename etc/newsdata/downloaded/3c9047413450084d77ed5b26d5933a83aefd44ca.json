Even if it does face difficulties in the leadership transition, the underlying ideology and the sectarian hatred it promoted remains attractive to many.\n\nWhere once they rode around in armored vehicles, brandished rifles, flew black flags and indulged in acts of spectacular cruelty, the Sunni Muslim militants are now prisoners or scattered stragglers whose leader was chased down in a tunnel during a raid by American special forces.\n\n\"Operationally it doesn't affect much, they are already broken and globally their attacks have receded,\" said Rashad Ali, resident senior fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based think-tank. \"They are mostly concentrated in the Iraqi-Syria borderlands.\"\n\n\"It doesn't make much of a difference other than the symbolism,\" he said. \"If you think taking out one terrorist (matters) while failing to address the root causes that led this ideology to take hold, you are mistaken.\"\n\nBut some of those grievances are very much on show today. Sunni Muslims in Iraq are angered at their treatment by a ruling Shi'ite elite they see as under the influence of Iran and the Iranian-backed militias that now roam their provinces unchecked.\n\n\n\n\n\nRECRUITMENT\n\nIn Syria, recruitment to groups such as Islamic State is encouraged by the killing of Sunnis by Syrian government forces backed by Iran and Russia.\n\nIslamic State's effectiveness arises from its members' loyalty to its ultra-fanatical Islamist ideology, and this may not be much affected by the killing of its leader, said Fadhil Abu Ragheef, an Iraqi political analyst and security expert.\n\nHe said Islamic State's 9-man Shura Council, or leadership group, was expected to meet and appoint a leader from among five candidates.\n\nAmong the front runners are Abu Abdullah al-Jizrawi, a Saudi, and Abdullah Qaradash, an Iraqi and one of Baghdadi's right-hand men, also a former army officer under Saddam Hussein. Also mentioned is Abu Othman al-Tunisi, a Tunisian.\n\n\"The new leader will start working to pull together the group's power by relying on new recruits and fighters who fled the prisons in Syria. He is expected to launch a series of retaliatory attacks for the killing of Baghdadi,\" said Abu Ragheef.\n\nIt is possible that whoever takes over as the head of the group, which experts say has been beset by internal disputes, will cause it to splinter within months because he is unacceptable on grounds of nationality to some factions.\n\n\"For sure they will fight among themselves over resources. I predict the Iraqi faction will win because they have more money,\" said Iraqi analyst Hisham al-Hashemi, an expert on jihadist groups.\n\nA security source with knowledge of militant groups in Iraq said the killing of Baghdadi would splinter the group's command structure because of differences between senior figures and lack of confidence among group members who were forced to go underground when the caliphate collapsed.\n\n\"We are aware that killing Baghdadi will not lead to the disappearance of Islamic State because eventually they will pick someone for the job,\" the source said. \"But at same time whoever follows Baghdadi will not be in a position to keep the group united.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOPERATIONS\n\nThe new leader will attempt to restructure the group by encouraging followers to launch operations not only in Iraq but in other countries to raise morale among existing and new followers, the source said.\n\nBy franchising its name, Islamic State has attracted followers in Africa, Asia and Europe. Incidents such as one in London, where attackers used easily obtained weapons such as motor vehicles and knives, show that lack of organizational backing is not an obstacle.", "description": "The killing of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is of considerable importance, experts believe, but the underlying reasons for his jihadist group's existence remain and attacks in the Middle East and beyond are not likely to stop.
