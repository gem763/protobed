It is feared that the woman was four months pregnant\n\nThat particular stretch of beach in the Zambujeira do Mar area has no lifeguard service after September 15\n\nIt also claimed two friends who were with the Brits on holiday in the area witnessed the drama as it unfolded.\n\nMaritime Police chief Rui Pedro Silva Filipe spoke after the tragedy to confirm the dead pair's ages and nationalities.\n\nHe said: 'They were in Portugal on holiday with a group of friends.\n\n'It appears the man went to the woman's aid when he saw she was in difficulties and was holding onto a rock.\n\n'He reached her but it was when they were coming back to the beach that they disappeared from view, maybe because they had got tired.\n\n'Local surfers went to their aid and got them out of the water to a small area of sand near the main beach but by that time they had already gone into cardiac arrest.\n\n'Medical responders had already reached the scene and made an unsuccessful attempt to revive them by practicing CPR.\n\n'They were taken to a local health centre where they were pronounced dead and their bodies have now been taken to Beja for the autopsies to take place.'\n\nThe beach where the tragedy occurred has no lifeguard service after September 15 and officials have described the sea yesterday afternoon/on Sunday afternoon as a 'little bit rough.'\n\nThe medical responders reached the scene by helicopter and made an unsuccessful attempt to revive them by practicing CPR\n\nA friend had rushed into the water to save the woman when she got into difficulties and was spotted clinging to a rock. He managed to reach her but he too started to struggle as they made their way back to shore (stock image)\n\nStrong currents are believed to have played a part in the tragedy, which led to the mobilization of emergency responders including police and firefighters as well as a Portuguese Air Force helicopter which removed the Brits' bodies from the area of sand the surfers took them to.\n\nSocial media warnings highlight the 'Zambujeira Rip current' located left of the main beach.\n\nOne local said last year on Instagram: 'A rip current forms because wind and breaking waves push surface water towards the land and this causes a slight rise in the water level along the shore.\n\n'This excess water will tend to flow back to the open water via the route of least resistance.\n\n'When there is a local area which is slightly deeper or a break in an offshore sand bar or reef, this can allow water to flow offshore more easily and this will initiate a rip current though that gap.\n\n'Even tough rip currents are usually used by experienced surfers to paddle out easily to the outside surf areas but they are extremely dangerous to any beach swimmer or surfing beginner.'\n\nZambujeira do Mar hosts an annual five-day music festival called the MEO Sudoeste.\n\nThe likes of Madness have played at the festival, which takes place in August.\n\nThe event focuses on dance music but also includes hip hop, pop and reggae. This year's performers included Rita Ora.", "description": "The 33-year-old was pronounced dead after surfers brought her ashore along with a 34-year-old British man at Zambujeira do Mar on Portugal's south-west coast.", "authors": ["Gerard Couzens", "Martin Robinson", "Chief Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/06/19371576-0-image-a-2_1570427817261.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
