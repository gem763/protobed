Gavin Newsom and the extended discourse surrounding the passing of the bill.\n\n\"How do you look at this changing the landscape of college athletics, and do you like it? Do you like part of it? Are you completely against kids getting anything? Where are you?\" Goodman asked.\n\nWhat it means: How California bill will impact college sports, and what comes next\n\nMore: Warriors' Draymond Green rips NCAA's opposition to Fair Pay to Play, calls organization a 'dictatorship'\n\nMore: NCAA president Mark Emmert says California law could turn athletes into employees 'pretty fast'\n\nReplied Few: \"It's an incredibly complex issue, it's like healthcare in America.\"\n\n\"First of all I would love to figure out a way \u2014 and I think we got a great group of people working on that \u2014 what I find totally disappointing and disgusting is that a governor is wasting his time grandstanding around in something that he doesn't really understand when .00001 percent of his constituents are going to be impacted by this.\n\n\"He should probably stay in his lane \u2014 like I tell my players \u2014 and figure out homelessness and I think he's got a state that borders Mexico and get that mess figured out, and the budget and some things like that...\"\n\n\"He should probably stay in his lane - like I tell my players - and figure out homelessness. I think he's got a state that borders Mexico, and get that mess figured out.\"@ZagMBB head coach Mark Few didn't hold back when discussing @GavinNewsom with our @GoodmanHoops. pic.twitter.com/afbWTJ6nsg \u2014 Stadium (@Stadium) October 8, 2019\n\nFew also took exception with a story he claims to have seen where a sponsor of the bill said schools made \"billions of dollars,\" and said reports like that are not in line with reality. He said that athlete support has come a long way and that athletes \"don't want for anything.\"\n\n\"That being said, if there was a way we could monetize likeness and regulate it in a way to keep a fair playing field for everybody, then I'm all for it,\" Few said. \"If you're selling Adam Morrison jerseys ... of the two guys who could have made a lot of money last year, everybody thinks Zion (Williamson) let me tell you something Rui (Hachimura, already an icon of sorts in his native Japan)...\"\n\n\"Would have made money,\" Goodman replied.\n\n\"Yeah. I would have been all for it and I am all for it, but I'm not all for grandstanding politicians entering in or media members pulling low-hanging fruit off.\"\n\nGonzaga Bulldogs head coach Mark Few during the NCAA tournament in March.
