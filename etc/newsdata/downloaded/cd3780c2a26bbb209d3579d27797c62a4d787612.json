But starting next year, the status will instead be calculated based on the number of qualifying flights, which don\u2019t include basic economy tickets and points based on the number of dollars spent.\n\nThat means travelers will have to spend more to qualify for each Premier tier. But they\u2019ll also be rewarded for buying upgrades and seats on flights operated by Star Alliance partners, though at a lesser rate.\n\n\u201cThe goal of these changes was to offer a more valuable program to our most loyal and valued customers,\u201d a United spokesperson told FOX Business.\n\nPremier status provides MileagePlus members with perks like free upgrades, priority service, additional checked baggage and pre-boarding.\n\nUnited MileagePlus Chase cardholders will still be able to earn credit toward Premier status, but will no longer automatically qualify by spending $25,000 on the card in a year. Instead, they will be able to earn points toward the status by hitting certain spending thresholds.\n\nTo qualify for Premier Silver, the lowest tier, members will need at least 12 flights and 4,000 points. Travelers with just four flights under their belt can qualify with 5,000 points. Qualifying for the highest level, Premier 1K, will take 54 flights and 18,000 points, or 24,000 points with fewer flights.\n\nThe revamped system won\u2019t change how United\u2019s MileagePlus members earn their award miles. It also won\u2019t change how travelers qualify for United\u2019s Million Miler program, which will still be based on the actual distance flown.\n\nUnited has also made changes to make its frequent flier program easier for members, including eliminating expiration dates for miles. It also added discounts for MileagePlus members to join Clear, the biometric airport screening service.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "The distance you fly no longer matters when it comes to earning Premier status with United Airlines.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/04/0/0/origin.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
