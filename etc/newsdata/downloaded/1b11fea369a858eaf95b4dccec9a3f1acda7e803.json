But How Would They Be Used in War?", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s no secret that the Russian navy is investing heavily in new classes of submarines, even while overall Russian military spending flatlines amid a wide economic crisis. But it\u2019s less clear exactly what the Russians intend to do with potentially dozens of modern submarines in the event of war.\n\nWestern analysts should think creatively in order to suss out the Kremlin\u2019s undersea intentions, Norman Polmar, a leading American naval analyst, wrote in Proceedings, the professional journal of the U.S. Naval Institute.\n\n\u201cSubmarines appear to have a high priority in Russia\u2019s current efforts to rebuild its armed forces,\u201d Polmar wrote in the October 2019 edition of Proceedings. \u201cHow will the submarines most likely be employed? The answer must be determined by thinking outside the box.\u201d\n\nWhere the Russian navy is all but abandoning the production of new aircraft carriers, cruisers and other \u201cblue-water\u201d surface warships, it has recommitted to sustaining a large fleet of big, long-range submarines.\n\n\u201cAlthough the navy is mainly made up of Soviet-era surface ships and submarines, an extensive modernization program is underway, focusing first on the submarine force,\u201d the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency reported in 2017. \u201cProgress in submarine modernization is underway.\n\nAs recently as 2017, the Russian fleet operated 61 submarines. \u201cHistorically the backbone of the Russian navy, 75 percent of the 61 operational submarines are over 20 years old and are slowly being replaced,\u201d the DIA explained.\n\nThree new classes account for the bulk of new production. The Borei- or Dolgorukiy-class, nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarine, the Yasen-class, a nuclear-powered attack submarine and an improved version of the Kilo-class diesel-electric attack submarine.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Where the Russian navy is all but abandoning the production of new aircraft carriers, cruisers and other \u201cblue-water\u201d surface warships, it has recommitted to sustaining a large fleet of big, long-range submarines.
