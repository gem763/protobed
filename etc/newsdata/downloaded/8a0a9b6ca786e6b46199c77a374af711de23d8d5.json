Laredo, Texas, came in as the least expensive urban area for retirees, with an index score of 76 out of 100.\n\n\u201cAside from having the lowest cost of living, Laredo is in Texas, which \u201cdoesn\u2019t tax Social Security or pensions, and does not have an inheritance or estate tax,\u201d WalletHub analyst Jill Gonzalez tells MarketWatch. \u201cThis lack of taxation is an advantage for those looking to retire anywhere in the state, as their fixed income can stretch that much further.\u201d She adds that \u201cLaredo also has the lowest annual cost of in-home services, and one of the lowest annual costs of adult day health care.\u201d\n\nMemphis and Knoxville, Tenn., rounded out the top three least expensive places to retire. (MarketWatch recently spotlighted Memphis one of four great American cities where you can retire on $40,000 or less.)\n\n10 least expensive cities for retirees:\n\n1. Laredo, Texas\n\n2. Memphis, Tenn.\n\n3. Knoxville, Tenn.\n\n4. Huntington, W. Va.\n\n5. Fort Smith, Ark.\n\n6. San Antonio, Texas\n\n7. Amarillo, Texas\n\n8. Oklahoma City, Okla.\n\n9. Toledo, Ohio\n\n10. Jackson, Miss.\n\nWalletHub used cost-of-living-index data from the Council for Community and Economic Research on 270 urban areas \u2014 which measures the costs of groceries, housing, utilities, transportation, health care, and miscellaneous goods and services \u2014 and then adjusted that data to increase the weight of health-care expenses, as these are increasingly important in retirement.\n\n(One expense retirees tend to vastly underestimate in retirement is health care. Fidelity estimates that \u201can average retired couple age 65 in 2019 may need approximately $285,000 saved [after tax] to cover health care expenses in retirement.\u201d)\n\nMeanwhile, San Francisco and New York topped the list of the most expensive places for retirees, according to WalletHub\u2019s analysis \u2014 largely driven by housing costs.\n\n10 most expensive cities for retirees:\n\n1. San Francisco\n\n2. New York\n\n3. Pearl City, Hawaii\n\n4. Honolulu\n\n5. San Jose, Calif.\n\n6. Fremont, Calif.\n\n7. Washington, D.C.\n\n8. Oakland, Calif.\n\n9. Seattle\n\n10. Boston\n\nWherever you retire, one thing is clear: There is no \u201cmagic\u201d number indicating how much you will need to live comfortably in retirement, as MarketWatch recently reported \u2014 and it may be more than you\u2019d think.\n\n\u201cFor many people, $1 million isn\u2019t enough to live off in retirement,\u201d Mitchell C. Hockenbury, a certified financial planner at 1440 Financial Partners, explained to MarketWatch. \u201cWith people living longer with the advances of medical care and the higher costs of living, a million dollars just doesn\u2019t go as far as it used to.\u201d", "description": "The cities and towns that are the most \u2014 and least \u2014 expensive for the over-65 set, according to a new study", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ675_laredo_ZG_20190904124034.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
