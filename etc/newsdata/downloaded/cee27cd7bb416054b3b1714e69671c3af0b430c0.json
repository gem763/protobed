Brave reporters, editors and publishers take on powerful, corrupt institutions in films such as \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d \u201cSpotlight\u201d and \u201cThe Post.\u201d Relentless determination triumphs in the final scenes as the news heroes drag the ugly truth into the light of day. Presidents and prelates are toppled; wars are hastened to their ends.\n\nBased on actual events? Yes \u2014 and yet deeply misleading if you draw general lessons from these exemplary cases. Journalism that changes the world is rare. More common is journalism that changes nothing.\n\nThe brave, intrepid reporting on Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder fits this category.\n\nThe antagonist was certainly formidable. Few institutions can rival the power of Saudi Arabia\u2019s royal family, which counts its wealth in trillions \u2014 with an emphatic capital T. The family\u2019s corruption is bone deep. The kingdom began lying on the day of Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance and never stopped, even as bit by gruesome bit the truth was learned and published.\n\nWe now know that Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist living in self-imposed exile, was lured into the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018, ostensibly to receive paperwork allowing him to be remarried in accordance with Saudi Arabian law. Hailing from a prominent family \u2014 his grandfather was personal physician to the king; an uncle was a billionaire arms dealer \u2014 Khashoggi was overconfident of his safety. Having criticized the thuggery of his country\u2019s new leadership in his writings for The Post and other outlets, he was a marked man, harassed online by Saudi troll farms, stalked by hackers of his friend\u2019s cellphone.\n\nWe now know that an elite assassination squad had flown into Turkey to meet Khashoggi. We know that a forensic pathologist was part of the team. His job was to cut the victim into pieces. The CIA concluded that the murder was authorized at the highest level of Saudi government, and a U.N. investigation concurred. In December, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution holding Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman personally responsible, and Time magazine featured the slain journalist on its \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d cover.\n\nThis is the point in the movie when the music would begin to swell. But in real life, it was the moment when the U.S. government fell into abject and shameful silence. After months of hemming and hawing (\u201cIt could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t\u201d), President Trump waffled pathetically. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo flew to Riyadh in January to shake the prince\u2019s bloody hand and smile obsequiously. Trump shook the same hand in June.\n\nVolleys of headlines over the past year have failed to pierce the protective veil of sycophancy that Trump and his administration have draped over the murderous prince known as MBS. This deference is hard to explain. Trump\u2019s courtship of the oil-ligarch has embroiled the United States in a wasteful, brutal war in Yemen while producing no advance in the administration\u2019s stillborn plans for a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. Trump\u2019s blind eye also overlooks the prince\u2019s mass executions and his prisons full of human rights activists.\n\nThe only thing Trump has noticed is the mountain of cash the Saudis promise to spend on U.S. weapons.\n\nThe case of Khashoggi should be an object lesson for every young person contemplating a journalism career. A reporter has no powers or privileges beyond those of every free human being; indeed, if you intend to do it right and play straight with the facts, you will have less latitude than those who feel free to spin and lie. Journalists subpoena no witnesses, issue no warrants, prosecute no crimes, pass no laws, enforce no regulations, set no public policies. Inevitably, that often means that we fail to right what seem to be obvious wrongs.\n\nThe Khashoggi case also teaches that, while the power of journalists is limited, the risks they take are real. At least 34 reporters were deliberately targeted for murder last year, including four killed in Annapolis. Many others are imprisoned. Lesser dangers are familiar to virtually everyone who pursues the news: the potential loss of friends, the attacks on one\u2019s reputation, the social media trolling and the drive-by slurs.\n\nSomewhere between caped superheroes and enemies of the people are the ordinary human beings who try their imperfect best to find and tell the truth to an audience that doesn\u2019t always want to hear it. We have only the powers to question, to learn and to bear witness \u2014 though it might not change anything. In telling the sordid story of Khashoggi\u2019s murder, we bear witness to the deflating fact that a coddled U.S. ally brazenly dismembered a journalist and critic just to shut him up, and the president of the United States did nothing about it.\n\nRead more about Jamal Khashoggi:\n\nA missing voice, a growing chorus\n\nRobert Menendez: Trump betrayed U.S. moral leadership with Saudi Arabia.
