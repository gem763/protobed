Malaysia won 3-2 with a goal in the seventh minute of stoppage time.\n\nFIFA warned Malaysia a first time for its fans' lack of discipline and throwing objects, and again for lack of order in its own stadium days later when hosting a qualifier against the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAfter crowd disturbances at Sierra Leone's home qualifier against Liberia last month, FIFA imposed a 50,000 Swiss francs ($50,250) fine and ordered a home game to be played in an empty stadium.\n\nSierra Leone was eliminated and the punishment should be served at a qualifying game for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nSudan's soccer federation was fined 30,000 Swiss francs ($30,150) for a pitch invasion by fans at a game against Chad.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
