(Photo: Lucasfilm)\n\nBabu Frik is love. Babu Frik is life. Babu Frik is... Babu Frik.\n\nYes, technically we already met Babu Frik \u2014 two words that I can no longer stop repeating to myself until they have lost what little meaning they already had\u2014as part of last week\u2019s Triple Force Friday merchandise reveal livestream, in tiny, barely visible plastic form. But the official Star Wars website just dropped our first actual look Babu in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.\n\nIn awe at the size of this lad. (Photo: Lucasfilm)\n\nIt did so alongside the announcement of a bunch of brand tie-ins, from Porsche to McDonalds, to celebrate the launch of The Rise of Skywalker this December \u2014 so I have to assume that the only way we can ever learn things about Babu Frik is through the announcement of various branding and merchandise exercises, which is a heady mix of depressing, hilarious, and also very Star Wars.\n\nBut the real deal here is the teeny, tiny tidbit of information we got about Babu alongside the image, which essentially confirms something fans had been speculating about ever since we saw the wee little fella in plastic form last week. Babu is an Anzellan droidsmith, who works with the Spice Runners of Kijimi, and \u201ccan reprogram or modify virtually any droid \u2014 regardless of the security measures protecting its systems.\u201d\n\nIdle hands are the Babu\u2019s playthings. (Image: Lucasfilm)\n\nGiven we saw C-3PO in an environment very similar to Babu\u2019s wire-covered workshop in the recent footage shown at D23, getting some creepy red \u201chelp I\u2019ve been re-programmed!\u201d looking eye lights, it seems pretty obvious that our hapless protocol droid friend is going to get his wires crossed by Babu at some point in the movie. It\u2019d explain why there\u2019s that art of Threepio running around with Chewie\u2019s bowcaster, too. Maybe thanks to Babu, one of those six million forms of communication Threepio is fluent in is murder.\n\nStar Wars: Babu Frik Is Here, God Dammit, better known as Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, hits theatres December 19.", "description": "Babu Frik is love.
