REUTERS/Zohra Bensemra/File Photo\n\n\u201cThe suffering is too much,\u201d he said, breaking into tears. \u201cIf we fail to put this thing to an end, we will all suffer...I have been sent by my fellow generals to represent them in the peace talks.\u201d\n\nWithin minutes, however, separatist leaders denied to Reuters any knowledge of Capture and Destroy or the other men presented as former fighters by the government during talks this week.\n\nThen Twitter erupted with ordinary Cameroonians questioning the true identity of the so-called generals.\n\n\u201cWhatever one says this (national dialogue) has unveiled some good actors!,\u201d said one widely-shared post.\n\nThe true identity of General Capture and Destroy is not yet clear and some observers said they recognise some fighters put forward by the government.\n\nBut the reaction to his appearance reveals the extent to which mistrust and partisanship in Cameroon have undermined any prospect of resolving the crisis without outside arbitration.\n\nThe talks, which close on Friday, could have opened the door to a historic peace agreement, ending a fight between the army and English-speaking militias seeking to form a breakaway state called Ambazonia. The conflict has cost nearly 2,000 lives, forced half a million people to flee and presented President Paul Biya with his biggest threat in nearly 40 years of rule.\n\nInstead, they were boycotted by separatists and moderate politicians and ended in acrimony.\n\n\u201cCameroon is a joke,\u201d said Cho Ayaba, a leading member of the Ambazonian Governing Council. \u201cLet me be absolutely clear: no Ambazonian is and will be part of Cameroon\u2019s charade.\u201d\n\n\u201cIT\u2019S A SHOW\u201d\n\nThe insurgency emerged after a heavy-handed government crackdown on peaceful protests late in 2016 in the Anglophone Northwest and Southwest regions by lawyers and teachers who complained of being marginalised by the French-speaking majority.\n\nThe roots of their grievances go back a century to the League of Nations\u2019 decision to split the former German colony of Kamerun between the allied French and British victors at the end of World War One.\n\nFor 10 years after the French- and English-speaking regions joined together in 1961, the country was a federation in which the Anglophone regions largely governed themselves. Biya\u2019s centralisation push after he came to power in 1982 quickly eroded any remaining Anglophone autonomy.\n\nWithin months of the initial 2016 protests, newly-formed armed groups were attacking army posts in the Anglophone regions. The army responded by burning down villages and shooting civilians.\n\nOnce vibrant cities, including the technology hub of Buea, have turned into ghost towns. Most schools have closed; villages have emptied out as people flee into Nigeria.\n\nSeparatists entrenched in the mountainous west say they will only come to the table if the government releases all political prisoners, including 10 leaders who were sentenced in August to life in prison on terrorism charges, and withdraws the military from the two English-speaking regions.\n\nBiya, who is 86 years old, has struggled to contain the problem. He rarely speaks in public or meets his government and spends months each year holidaying in Switzerland.\n\nHe said on Tuesday that he would drop charges against 333 prisoners held in relation to the crisis, but the move failed to appease separatists and moderates alike who say that thousands more remain imprisoned on trumped-up charges.\n\nCritics said talks this week were not inclusive and did not involve any discussion about a return to federalism that many say is the solution to the conflict.\n\nFormer opposition presidential candidate Akere Muna was told at the talks that the people allowed to speak at one session had already been identified and that he would not be able to participate.\n\n\u201cI said to myself, but that\u2019s not a dialogue,\u201d Muna told Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s a show and I\u2019m a spectator. I left.\u201d", "description": "General Capture and Destroy stepped to the microphone and in an impassioned speech to the media urged his fellow separatist fighters to lay down their arms and join Cameroon's government-led peace talks.", "authors": ["Josiane Kouagheu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437081573&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9318W", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
