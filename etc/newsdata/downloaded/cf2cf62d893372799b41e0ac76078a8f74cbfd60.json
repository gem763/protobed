In fact, taking on his case was a first.\n\n\u201cIt was just red. Bright red,\u201d his mother, Priscilla Maldonado, 25, told Today. \u201cYou could see all his veins; everything was exposed.\u201d\n\nBorn on New Year\u2019s Day this year, Ja\u2019bari Gray weighed a low 1.3kg. He spent the first three months of his life in a San Antonio Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and his family was told to prepare for the worst, but they refused to accept defeat.\n\nAnd now, after a skin transplant at Texas Children's Hospital, the little fighter\u2019s mother can finally kiss him.\n\nDoctors started covering Ja\u2019bari\u2019s body with skin grown inside a Boston lab that specialises in burn victims, from cells taken from the back of his ear in May \u2013 and used 12 trays of skin to do this, Maldonado told Today.\n\nTwo previous cases who didn't survive\n\n\n\nIt was reported that he tested well through the pregnancy until an ultrasound at 37 weeks showed that he wasn\u2019t gaining weight and his heart rate had dropped. Doctors then performed an emergency C-section and Ja\u2019bari came into the world \u201ccompletely silent\u201d, Maldonado previously told San Antonio Express-News.\n\nMaldonado says doctors told her only two other babies like Ja'bari had been born in the US, and neither of them survived.\n\nHis case, cited as a \u201cmedical mystery\u201d by medical professionals, has undergone a remarkable transformation and Ja\u2019bari now weighs a healthy 8.2kg, although he still has a long way to go.\n\nEven though his skin is slowly starting to grow on its own now, his eyes are fused shut and his fingers, toes and neck also became fused while he was in the NICU. He underwent two surgeries to open his eyelids, but they reclosed. His arms, right hand, right foot and neck will also require surgery to be separated.\n\nMore babies with different rare skin diseases\n\n\n\nLike Ja\u2019bari, many other babies around the world displayed no signs of something being wrong during the early stages of pregnancy. In September 2017, Anna Wilklow was born with a rare skin condition called Harlequin ichthyosis, Business Insider reports. According to the US National Library of Medicine, the extremely rare genetic condition occurs in one out of 300 000 babies.\n\nThe condition meant her skin cracked minutes after birth and her skin\u2019s tightness across the chest and stomach made breathing difficult. She was only diagnosed an hour after her birth and spent a full month in a medical care centre. Anna is covered in healing ointment and bathed multiple times a day to keep her skin from cracking.\n\nIn 2016, Harper Foy was immediately taken to the NICU after arriving in the world. Her skin was pulled so tightly that her eyelids had flipped inside out, reports Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital. She, too, had been born with Harlequin ichthyosis.\n\nThe one thing in common all the parents of these brave little fighters have is a will to never give up.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn't his purpose to be here, he would have been gone from birth or even before birth, so he does have a purpose in this world and we never know what it is until the future,\" Maldonado said to ABC News.\n\nImage: iStock", "description": "Ten months after birth, little Ja'bari Gray is off pain medication and breathing on his own, and one step closer to coming home.", "authors": ["Compiled Zakiyah Ebrahim"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9342/90d4cdacd0004a6fa1fe5a5bfd29b5ce.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
