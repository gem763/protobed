The wide-ranging legislation, which among other things would infringe on gay rights, limit free speech and punish sex out of marriage, is seen by critics as a threat to Indonesia\u2019s democracy and foreign investment.\n\nWhile Jokowi\u2019s moved to delay the amendments to the criminal code, the backlash over that legislation as well as another law passed last month that weakened the country\u2019s anti-graft agency, is a significant shift in mood just months after he enjoyed a landslide election win. On Wednesday, thousands of workers protested in front of the parliament over the country\u2019s labor, wage and health insurance regulations, which they say are discriminatory.\n\nStill, he noted there had been protests when he was mayor of Solo and governor of Jakarta. \u201cThey were normal,\u201d Jokowi said. \u201cAs president, there are protests in front of the palace too. Sometimes I ask them to come in and I listen to what they want to say. Sometimes I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWith Southeast Asia\u2019s biggest economy struggling in the face of the U.S.-China trade war and a global slowdown, it also looms as a complicating factor as he seeks support for reforms needed to boost growth and create millions of jobs.", "description": "Indonesia's Joko Widodo says people can express their opinions, but he has authority to see through reforms.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/8/20/b7fc843689254bfe87f8d4b5f0a5ce89_18.jpg"}
