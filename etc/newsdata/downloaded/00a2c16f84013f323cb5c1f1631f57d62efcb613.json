Campaign aides and advisers declined to disclose the location and its host, because of privacy and security concerns.\n\nIt turned out that Scott McNealy, co-founder and former CEO of Sun Microsystems, was hosting the fundraiser at his Palo Alto home. Crowds of protesters caught wind of the event and duly gathered nearby along with, apparently, a giant balloon depicting Trump as a baby.\n\nThe secrecy is indicative of Trump's status in Silicon Valley. The president has made few inroads in the tech industry in the past, and the wider industry has a reputation for being left-leaning.\n\nIn the 2016 election, nearly 99% of the political donations from Silicon Valley went to Hilary Clinton while just 1% went to Trump, for example.\n\nThis year, several high-profile figures have already made donations to Democrat presidential hopefuls.\n\nAccording to ABC, prospective Democratic Party candidate Pete Buttigieg has racked up donations from Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt, DoorDash CEO Tony Xu, and Pinterest founder Ben Silbermann, among others. Kamala Harris has received cash from LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, Salesforce chairman Marc Benioff, and Impossible Foods president Dennis Woodside.\n\nRead more: People are threatening to quit Equinox and SoulCycle following a report that the chairman of the trendy fitness brands plans to host a Trump fundraiser\n\nSilicon Valley's left-leaning tendencies might explain why Republican fundraisers aren't always welcomed in the area.\n\nThree years ago, the former chief executive of Intel Corp, Brian Krzanich, was forced to cancel an event for Trump at his Atherton, California home hours after the plan went public because it caused an uproar amongst employees, according to The Journal.\n\nDeveloper Stephen Ross faced an even bigger backlash this summer after he hosted a fundraiser for Trump at his Hamptons mansion and hundreds of people took to social media to boycott the companies that he invests in.", "description": "Scott McNealy, cofounder and former CEO of Sun Microsystems, hosted Trump's fundraiser at his Palo Alto home on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Mary Hanbury"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d81fa482e22af62c3247112-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
