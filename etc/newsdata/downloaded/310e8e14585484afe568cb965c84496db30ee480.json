The league had said the emblem violated a ban on political displays included in the MLS fan code of conduct adopted this season. MLS maintained the symbol is political because it has been appropriated by antifa, loosely organized groups of anti-fascists that sometimes engage in violence. Supporters\u2019 groups maintain the Iron Front represents opposition to fascism and persecution - a human rights issue, rather than a political stance.\n\nBanning fans' free speech is not consistent with our vision of sport. Or democracy Read more\n\nPortland Timbers and Seattle Sounders supporters\u2019 groups, as well as the Independent Supporters\u2019 Council, protested the ban, and some fans across the league continued to use the symbol on flags, banners and signs at games. Both sides met last Thursday in Las Vegas to find a resolution. An additional conference call was held on Tuesday afternoon. Public figures who opposed the ban included NBA Hall of Famer and Guardian columnist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\n\n\nMLS president Mark Abbott said in a statement the league would also form a working group to reexamine the code of conduct going forward. \u201cThis working group will include representatives from the league office and clubs and work collaboratively with leaders of club supporter groups and a cross-section of diversity and inclusion experts,\u201d Abbott said.\n\nThe supporters groups also issued a statement. \u201cThe Independent Supporters Council and supporter groups for the Portland Timbers and Seattle Sounders FC acknowledge the league\u2019s willingness to discuss these complex issues, as well as the league\u2019s affirmation of its long-time opposition to racism, fascism, white supremacy, white nationalism and homophobia,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe appreciate Major League Soccer\u2019s willingness to engage, listen, and learn. We look forward to continuing the dialogue, moving away from direct action in the stands on this issue, and instead focusing our energy on making progress around the table.\u201d\n\nThe league\u2019s fan code of conduct, implemented this season, prohibits \u201cusing (including on any sign or other visible representation) political, threatening, abusive, insulting, offensive language and/or gestures, which includes racist, homophobic, xenophobic, sexist or otherwise inappropriate language or behavior.\u201d\n\nEarlier this season, a fan waving a Trump 2020 flag was removed from Providence Park.\n\n", "description": "Major League Soccer is lifting its ban on signs and banners featuring an anti-Nazi symbol for the remainder of the season and the playoffs", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d81f51221684cf27f0e12f48ded901de7fe1e344/0_277_3758_2255/master/3758.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=71cbcb3a98ca1349a7ca64be0c7110cf", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
