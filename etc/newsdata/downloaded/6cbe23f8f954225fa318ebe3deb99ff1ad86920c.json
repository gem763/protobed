THE ROMANTIC WRAP\n\nWhen it comes to fashion, the cardinal rule has always dictated 'for spring, think pink' - and it seems designers did just that with their collections for 2019.\n\nPink powered the runways from Paris to New York all year long, with millennial, bubblegum and universally flattering blush taking centre stage, making it a surefire trend for spring racing Down Under.\n\nTake the hassle out of styling with the wrap-around No Limits Jumpsuit from Showpo, currently reduced from $79.95 to $40.\n\nLet your suit do the talking with a pair of 'barely there' black Twin Strap Tube Sandals from Pretty Little Thing, now on sale for $24.80.\n\nThe double-strap stilettos are strikingly similar to the $1,000 Purist Suede Sandals from Italian luxury footwear brand Aquazurra, one of Meghan Markle's best-loved labels.\n\nJump on the mini-bag bandwagon with a tiny $35 Black Crocodile Micro Bag, also from Pretty Little Thing.\n\nTotal cost: $99.80\n\nPowerful pink: Jumpsuits are the hassle-free, statement style of the season, with a wide variety available for next to nothing, like this $40 wrap-waist one-piece from Showpo\n\n2. THE RIVIERA RIG\n\nThe stalls at Royal Randwick may be thousands of miles from the streets of Portofino, but slipping into a tailored ivory jumpsuit and stacked espadrilles will make you feel like you're strolling along the Italian Riviera.\n\nShowpo's linen White East Coast Jumpsuit looks decidedly more expensive than its $56 price tag, particularly when you pair it with Monochrome Lace Up Espadrilles from Pretty Little Thing.\n\nOriginally priced at $72, the fashion-forward wedges are currently on sale for $27.\n\nTop the look with a $9 Classic Panama Hat from Kmart for a true sense of la dolce vita.\n\nTotal cost: $92\n\nLa dolce vita: White linen and a classic Panama hat is a fail safe combination for spring racing, and Showpo's reasonable collection of chic jumpsuits (like this $56 piece) provides something to suit all budgets and tastes\n\n3. THE LILAC LOOK\n\nDubbed the colour of 2019 by Harper's Bazaar, lilac has swiftly become the signature red carpet shade of celebrities like Victoria Beckham and Amal Clooney.\n\nBut your moment in the purple rain need not come with an A-list price tag, thanks to an array of chic styles from fast-fashion brands Down Under.\n\nCurrently reduced from $39.99 to just $19.98, the Lexia Long Sleeve Mini-Dress from Cotton On is a fun, flirty and fashion-forward choice for spring racing.\n\nAdd some height with a pair of Yeezy-inspired perspex Raye Mules from Dazie, currently on sale for $29 from The Iconic.\n\nFinish the look with a stack of $15 Gold Penny Pendant Necklaces from Pretty Little Thing and an on-trend Pearl Hair Clip, available from Rubi for $6.99.\n\nTotal cost: $70.97\n\nPurple rain: Lilac has enjoyed a huge revival since the beginning of 2019 with an array of A-listers opting for the shade on the red carpet, and fast-fashion brands like Cotton On have been quick to cop the growing demand for purple designs\n\n4. THE MONOCHROME MINI\n\nGivenchy's Claire Waight Keller may tout black-and-white dresses as her signature design, but that doesn't give luxury brands (and their associated price tags) a monopoly on monochrome.\n\nAt $35, the playful Bianca Gingham Mini-Dress from Supr\u00e9 is a steal without comprising on style.\n\nElevate the form-fitting frock with black suede Addison Mules from Spurr, originally $70 but currently on sale for $34.\n\nShield your eyes from the spring sun with a pair of Versace-inspired Chelsea sunglasses from Supr\u00e9, available in store and online for $15.\n\nTotal cost: $84\n\nCheck mate: Never out of style, eternally chic monochrome is a safe bet for spring racing and a pair of black point-toe heels like these $34 suede mules from Spurr will see you through the entire season\n\nTHE AUSTRALIAN TURF CLUB MEMBER'S DRESS CODE Members of the Australian Turf Club are expected to adhere to the official dress code, designed to maintain the 'sense of occasion that makes race day so special'.

THE BOHEMIAN BEACH DRESS\n\nBreaking the decades long reign of the little black dress, 2019 has seen the sartorial set shift its focus to the cooler climes of the little white dress.\n\nWhere the LBD is timeless and classic, the LWD offers a lighter, breezier and more experimental look, perfect for spring racing Down Under.\n\nEsteemed New York designer Brandon Maxwell has released a litany of little white dresses this season, as has iconic Australian label Zimmermann, but with a little detective work there's bargain buys to be had.\n\nAt $39.99, the Woven Amber Wrap Mini-Dress from Cotton On provides a flattering fit with a fashionable scallop frill detail.\n\nTake your LWD to new heights with a pair of classic tan Lily Block Heels from Rubi, available online for $39.99.\n\nAlternatively, slip into the trendy Tortoise Shell Block Heels from Pretty Little Thing, marked down from $60 to $17.40.\n\nPack racing essentials into Pretty Little Thing's Brown Rectangle Beaded Mini-Bag, currently reduced from $60 to $26.\n\nTotal cost: $83.39\n\nWhite hot: The little white dress has replaced the classic LBD as the go-to garment of the street style set, so join the ivory revolution in this $39 woven wrap dress from Australian brand Cotton On\n\n8.
