He could have, like Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey, expressed tepid support for the protesters. He could have, like new Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai, made the case that this was a complicated geopolitical situation, even if the protesters\u2019 basic demand\u2014more democratic rule\u2014isn\u2019t really. He could have, like nearly everyone else in the National Basketball Association, kept his mouth shut and, if pushed, indicated that the whole thing is too distant for him to have any educated opinion on.\n\nJames did not do any of these things, however. Instead, just as the controversy that consumed the NBA for over a week seemed to be dying down, James used his considerable platform to throw Morey under the bus for costing the league money:\n\n\n\nI think when we all sit back and learn from the situation that happened, understand that what you could tweet or could say. We all talk about this freedom of speech. Yes, we all do have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you\u2019re not thinking about others, and you\u2019re only thinking about yourself. I don\u2019t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke, and so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically. Emotionally. Spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say, and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.\n\nJames later clarified that he wasn\u2019t speaking about the substance of Morey\u2019s tweet. He wasn\u2019t commenting on the validity of the protests in Hong Kong. Rather, he was chiding the Rockets GM for saying anything at all.\n\n\n\nWhile James\u2019s concern for the safety of himself and his teammates is understandable, he was speaking as a businessman. James, like other professional basketball players, has made many trips to China, which is seen as a goldmine. China severed a number of economic ties with the NBA in the wake of Morey\u2019s comments, costing the league and its players millions of dollars. Reporting over the last few days has revealed that one of James\u2019s teammates saw a $1 million endorsement deal go up in smoke. Other players have certainly lost money as well.", "description": "Why James's comments on the NBA's China scandal were so disappointing", "authors": ["Alex Shephard"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/278d84712623b02f531a89c0f59e93a04e30904e.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
