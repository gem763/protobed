The OAS as a whole should evaluate themselves and the mission it sent as well,\u201d Morales said.\n\nThe OAS mission did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a preliminary report, the group cited the disruption to a preliminary tally and the subsequent resignation of the vice president of the electoral board as having damaged the election\u2019s credibility.\n\nMorales, who has governed for almost 14 years, had already faced charges of authoritarianism for running for a fourth term in defiance of term limits and a national referendum that opposed lifting them.\n\nMesa has called for ongoing peaceful marches until Morales convenes a second-round vote, which an alliance of regional authorities and other opposition leaders backed on Thursday.\n\nEven if he secures another five-year term, Morales will likely govern with his weakest mandate yet and without the solid majority he has thus far enjoyed in Congress.\n\nBolivia's President Evo Morales speaks during a news conference at the presidential palace La Casa Grande del Pueblo in La Paz, Bolivia, October 24, 2019.

Not because people will rise up against him but because it will be hard for him to govern,\u201d Yerko Ilijic, a Bolivian political analyst, told Reuters.\n\nIlijic added that he expected anti-government protests to eventually fade.\n\nMorales said he would welcome an OAS audit of the final count but urged the group and the international community to respect the South American country\u2019s constitution.\n\nThe head of Washington-based OAS, Luis Almagro, has accepted Bolivia\u2019s invitation to carry out an audit but said the group\u2019s conclusions should be legally binding.\n\nMorales appeared to reject that condition, however, saying only \u201cwe\u2019re going to negotiate.\u201d\n\nThe permanent council of the OAS, which is made up of states in the Western Hemisphere, is expected to receive Bolivia\u2019s foreign minister later in the day after holding a meeting to discuss its election on Wednesday.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nOn Thursday morning, the official vote count showed Morales had 47% with nearly 99% of ballots counted - putting him 10 points ahead of Mesa. The winner needs 40% of votes plus a 10-point lead to win outright and avoid a Dec. 15 second round.\n\nThe head of a group of retired Bolivian military officers, Mario Alberto Almeida, called Sunday\u2019s vote the latest \u201cfraudulent\u201d election to give Morales a win and called on the armed forces and military brass to defend the constitution.\n\nPresidency Minister Juan Ramon Quintana dismissed the group Almeida represents as \u201ctin soldiers\u201d linked to past dictatorships and said the military would be loyal to Morales\u2019 government.", "description": "Bolivian President Evo Morales rebuked a regional election observer mission on Thursday for questioning the legitimacy of what he insisted was an outright win for him in the first round of a disputed election.", "authors": ["Mitra Taj", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444606167&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N1U3", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
