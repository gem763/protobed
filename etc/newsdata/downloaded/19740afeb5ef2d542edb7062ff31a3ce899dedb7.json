So for come-lately fans wondering, Where did this tiny filthy phenom come from?!, \u201cDear Girls\u201d fills in the gaps. Wong\u2019s study abroad program to her mom\u2019s native Vietnam, for example, proved culturally and ideologically formative, leaving her with a taste both for exploring the outer limits of her comfort zone \u2014 so crucial to her brand of comedy \u2014 and for eating fertilized duck embryos. \u201cIt was practically still alive,\u201d she writes of first ingesting the delicacy, \u201cbut after that moment I became really intolerant of anybody who got grossed out by something other people in the world ate for breakfast every day. Just shut the [expletive] up and eat a duck baby.\u201d\n\nWong\u2019s skyrocketing success of late \u2014 from selling out mega venues on her Milk & Money tour, to starring in, co-writing and producing the hit Netflix rom-com \u201cAlways Be My Maybe\u201d \u2014 gets lassoed down to earth with humbling, early-years anecdotes about fearing for her life on seedy tours, trying out material in clubs that doubled as laundromats and bombing in front of Eddie Murphy. \u201cI knew Eddie Murphy specifically wasn\u2019t laughing,\u201d Wong writes, \u201cbecause everyone knows when Eddie Murphy is or isn\u2019t laughing. You could recognize his signature \u2018HANH-HANH-HANH\u2019 goose honk anywhere. And that night, there were no geese.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDear Girls\u201d can be crude and flippant, LOL-dense and breezy \u2014 so breezy, in fact, you will be desensitized to the grossest of Wong\u2019s gross-outs by chapter one, at which point you have already learned how to hold in a fart during yoga. But as with her stage comedy, she is also sneakily thoughtful about the public roles she occupies \u2014 Asian American, working mom, woman on comedy stages \u2014 and the come-from-behind grind they necessarily demand. \u201cConvincing an audience that a person who looks like me could be funny,\u201d she writes, \u201cand proving to them that I belonged onstage, was a steep uphill battle.\u201d She even offers surprisingly tender takes on her immigrant-minded parents, her sensitive husband (who contributes his own chapter as an afterword) and motherhood, the match that lit her career on fire.\n\nWong\u2019s daughters should consider themselves lucky to have a self-made, cultural touchstone for a mother, let alone one doling out personalized advice about dating rappers, the importance of travel and surefire signifiers of a worthy Chinese restaurant: \u201cThe pork and shrimp will arrive right away, but it takes an hour to get a glass of water.\u201d But if they indeed tuck into this memoir, they will learn more than they ever cared to \u2014 in vibrant technicolor, yikes \u2014 about mom\u2019s sex life. \u201cDear Girls,\u201d and all readers it may concern: In print, Wong is every inch the crass-master she plays on TV, so gird your gag reflex.\n\nRachel Rosenblit is a freelance writer and editor in New York.\n\nDear Girls\n\nIntimate Tales, Untold Secrets & Advice for Living Your Best Life\n\nBy Ali Wong\n\nRandom House. 240 pp. $27\n\nAD", "description": "The comedian\u2019s \u201cDear Girls\u201d supplies the same kinds of shocked laughs as her Netflix specials.", "authors": ["Rachel Rosenblit"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HO_cZVqYszlQr-LuilC_xqE-oBA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GRCYT4XMMQI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
