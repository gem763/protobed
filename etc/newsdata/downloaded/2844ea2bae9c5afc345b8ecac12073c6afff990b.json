And add to this the certain knowledge that Trump would not defend you for half a second if it didn\u2019t immediately benefit him.\n\nThis creates a political environment in which conviction has moved from impossible to unlikely. The national erosion of Trump\u2019s support has been significant. This has taken away the political risk for Democrats moving forward with impeachment. But the removal of the president will probably depend on public opinion among Republicans in 20 red or purple states. In most such places, at least for Republican officeholders, the political cost of criticizing the president remains high. Growing support for Trump\u2019s impeachment has generally resulted from the hardening of existing opposition, not the wearing away of support in the GOP.\n\nGiven the depth and durability of the United States\u2019 political divisions, and the deep redness of many red states, this may never happen. Yet, for Republican senators, the full cost of complicity in Trump\u2019s corruption is becoming clear.", "description": "", "authors": ["Michael Gerson", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Senate-Republicans-Must-Weigh-The-Full-Cost-Of-Complicity"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
