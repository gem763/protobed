Some of the most important ways for Germany to have won the war would have been to have waited until German industries had recovered from the limitations imposed by the Versailles Treaty to maximize Germany\u2019s military potential. It would have entailed a more prudent utilization of Germany\u2019s limited military-industrial resources, better organization and increased mobility of her army. Here are some examples:\n\nDon\u2019t risk war with Allies until 1941 or 1943\n\nDue to the fact that the German rearmament program was not projected to be completed until 1943, Hitler expected the outbreak of war would not occur until then or until 1941 at the earliest. Accordingly, Hitler was completely caught off guard when Britain and France declared war against him on September 3, 1939 over his invasion of Poland. Germany\u2019s generals warned Hitler that the army was not ready for war in 1939. Not only were one-third of Germany\u2019s army divisions still seriously underequipped, but there was a major shortage of officers due to the massive expansion of the German Army from seven to 103 divisions during a five year period. Due to the serious shortage of tanks armed with 37mm guns or above, the German Army was forced to employ 2,000 obsolete Panzer I and Panzer II training tanks which the Germans had never intended to use in war. While the punitive Treaty of Versailles did not end up accomplishing its purpose in keeping Germany economically destitute, militarily powerless, divided and downtrodden, let alone prevent a Second World War, its ban on Germany building tanks actually contribute toward Nazi Germany losing World War Two.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "What if the German Army had actually been ready to fight?", "authors": ["David T.
