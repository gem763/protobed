Since the bulges that form the \u201ceyes\u201d appear to be the same size, we can be sure that the two galaxies involved in the crash were of equal size. This is different from the more common collisions in which small galaxies are gobbled up by their larger neighbours.\u2019", "description": "The creepy-looking visage is a rare ring galaxy which formed during an epic galactic crash.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/heic1919a-d440_1572274240.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
