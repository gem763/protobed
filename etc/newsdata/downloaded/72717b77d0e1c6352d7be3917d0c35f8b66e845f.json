The city\u2019s Education Department ruled that employee participation would violate rules ensuring a \u201cpolitically neutral learning environment,\u201d as would schools that stage their own climate-action walkouts on school property.\n\nMs. Fassihi was crestfallen. As an Iranian-American who grew up in Tehran unable to freely express opinions, she said she had been excited to see her children\u2019s school teaching civic engagement by example, along with teaching about climate science.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so upsetting \u2014 I\u2019d been so proud and happy, we were talking about how every voice counts, about freedom of speech,\u201d she said. \u201cBesides, we\u2019ve been talking about climate change not as a political issue, but as a scientific fact.\u201d", "description": "The decision underlines the difficulties in separating the politics of climate change from teaching about the science of it.", "authors": ["Anne Barnard"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/20/nyregion/20nyclimate-print/19nyclimate2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
