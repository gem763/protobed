And even if those claims were correct, that wouldn\u2019t matter, since he never actually managed to obstruct anything\u2014and even if he had obstructed something, he would have been well within his rights. Oh, and in the end, it was all Barack Obama\u2019s fault.\n\nThough Mueller ultimately punted on answering that question, his 400-plus-page report detailed 10 episodes in which the president appeared to meddle with the Mueller\u2019s probe. And though the report noted it \u201cdid not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government,\u201d investigators did establish \u201cmultiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government.\u201d\n\nBut prominent members of Team Trump shrugged that off on Thursday. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway called it \u201cthe best day since he got elected.\u201d Not too far from the West Wing, Trump\u2019s outside legal team\u2014which set up shop for the big day at the offices of the American Center for Law & Justice\u2014also declared victory and defended Trump\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of disputes about recollection, and how [different] people saw things, but so what? It didn\u2019t happen,\u201d said Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, regarding obstruction of justice allegations. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do it, [even though] he had every right to fire Mueller\u2014as long as he replaced Mueller with someone else, and as long as he didn\u2019t do it with coercion, or anything like that\u2026 If it\u2019s done with an innocent motive, meaning you\u2019re doing your job and getting rid of someone who\u2019s a bad FBI director [like James Comey] or a bad special counsel\u2026you\u2019re allowed to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201c Nothing was hidden, burned, destroyed, thrown away by the president. So it\u2019s very tough to conclude that someone committed obstruction. \u201d \u2014 Rudy Giuliani\n\nGiuliani, reiterating his belief in Trump\u2019s innocence, added, \u201cNothing was hidden, burned, destroyed, thrown away by the president. So it\u2019s very tough to conclude that someone committed obstruction [and] Mueller couldn\u2019t do it\u2026 They couldn\u2019t [even] cobble together a charge.\u201d\n\nThis was merely part of the latest Trumpworld attempt to barrel through a crisis that has plagued this president for almost two years. By the end of this week, everyone in Trump\u2019s inner sanctum had a similar refrain: The boss isn\u2019t guilty, but even if he had done it, it wouldn\u2019t be illegal.\n\nWell before the Mueller report was made public, and before Attorney General William Barr delivered his remarks to the press on Thursday, Giuliani knew what was coming. Jay Sekulow, another one of Trump\u2019s personal attorneys, confirmed to The Daily Beast on Thursday morning that he, Giuliani, and Jane and Martin Raskin (all members of the president\u2019s outside legal team) were welcomed into the Department of Justice to view a version of Mueller\u2019s report ahead of its release\u2014on Tuesday late afternoon, and again on Wednesday. Sekulow said the team had \u201cput in a formal request\u201d late last week, which Barr approved.\n\nTo Trump\u2019s current and former lawyers, however, Mueller\u2019s report isn\u2019t simply exonerating\u2014it\u2019s also problematic.\n\n\u201cFor example, half of what they attribute to [Trump\u2019s former fixer and lawyer Michael] Cohen is lies,\u201d Giuliani alleged, going after one of his recurring enemies. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they even put in a Cohen section. A lot of that report is extremely unfair.\u201d\n\nJohn Dowd, an attorney who represented Trump for nearly a year in the 21-month-long investigation, took exception to one of his cameos in the report. In late 2017, after the president\u2019s fired national security adviser Michael Flynn withdrew from a joint defense agreement and started cooperating with investigators, \u201cthe President\u2019s personal counsel\u201d left a voicemail for Flynn\u2019s lawyers \u201creminding them of the President\u2019s warm feelings towards Flynn,\u201d according to the report.\n\nOn this message, the unnamed counsel\u2014who appears to be Dowd\u2014asked for a \u201cheads up\u201d if Flynn knew any \u201cinformation that implicates the President,\u201d the report reads. When Flynn\u2019s lawyer responded that Flynn could no longer share that kind of information, \u201cthe President's personal counsel was indignant and vocal in his disagreement,\u201d according to the Mueller report. Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal counsel said he would make sure that the President knew that Flynn\u2019s actions reflected \u2018hostility\u2019 towards the President.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was no hostility on my part,\u201d Dowd said on Thursday. \u201cWe understood that they had a strong case and thought that they could talk the [special counsel] out of any charges. We didn\u2019t understand there\u2019d be any charges. And I first learned about the Joint Defense conclusion in the press. I called him and that was it. I did not get upset, nor was I upset. I was supporting Gen. Flynn.\u201d\n\nRegarding the Mueller report\u2019s characterization of his tone and intent, Dowd replied, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. That\u2019s false.\u201d Trump\u2019s former attorney also insisted that Mueller\u2019s team \u201cnever raised [this subject] with me and I saw [Mueller\u2019s colleague] Jim Quarles every week and Bob Mueller once a month.\u201d\n\nConway, for her part, trumpeted Mueller\u2019s findings as a pure vindication of the president and those around him, even as she attempted to dismiss findings that could be politically tricky for the president, or give lie to the administration\u2019s previous public statements on the matter.\n\nAsked by reporters about Mueller\u2019s findings that Trump tried, on numerous occasions, to hinder the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation, Conway shot back, \u201cthat\u2019s punditry, that\u2019s not sophisticated legal analysis.\u201d She added that she was \u201cusing my very expensive law degree today.\u201d\n\nAnd while many of Trump\u2019s prospective 2020 Democratic opponents have been hesitant to harp on the Russia issue on the campaign trail, Trump\u2019s counselor nevertheless took the opportunity to ding the Democratic presidential field with the special counsel\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cYou have 15, 18 people running for president and not a single message doesn't involve Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump,\u201d Conway said.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats have nothing,\u201d she added. \u201cThey banked everything on this.\u201d\n\nHeading into the holiday weekend, President Trump jetted off to Mar-a-Lago, his private Florida getaway, to mark Easter and keep celebrating. \u201c\u2018Donald Trump was being framed, he fought back. That is not Obstruction,\u2019\u201d the president tweeted on the way to his club, live-tweeting a comment made on Fox News by Trump-loving host Jesse Watters. \u201cI had the right to end the whole Witch Hunt if I wanted. I could have fired everyone, including Mueller, if I wanted. I chose not to. I had the RIGHT to use Executive Privilege. I didn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nAs Trump closed out his Thursday, he appeared both in a good spirits and focused on cable news. According to one of his personal attorneys, that\u2019s exactly how he began his Thursday, as well.\n\nGiuliani told The Daily Beast that both he and Sekulow spoke by phone to the president twice on Thursday, shortly before and then after the report\u2019s release. Trump was in a \u201cgreat mood,\u201d per Giuliani, and both lawyers briefed the president on which TV news programs\u2014on CNN, on Fox\u2014they would appear on through Easter Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe always tell him what shows we\u2019re going to be doing,\u201d he said.", "description": "On Mueller Thursday, Trumpworld looked to have it both ways: Embracing the special counsel\u2019s findings while slagging them, too.", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "Betsy Woodruff", "Lachlan Markay", "White House Reporter", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1555631638/190418-Swin-Betsy-team-trump-tease_o6bnsz", "published_at": "2019-04-18"}
