Some of our guys aren\u2019t making Jon Jones money, so if it has happened it\u2019s been little money.\u201d\n\nLester\u2019s complaints highlighted the fact that he worked on a handshake, rather than a drawn-up contract, and Davis said he works under a similar arrangement with his fighters.\n\n\u201cI deal with people by handshake because I believe in what I do, and if me and them don\u2019t agree, then I just won\u2019t work with them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t really had too many problems with guys I\u2019ve coached. And with the other coaches (at Xtreme Couture) it doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019ve had too many problems as well.\u201d\n\nDavis also said he keeps the equilibrium at the gym by keeping a close eye on the attitudes of new arrivals at the gym to ensure they fit into the ethos and work ethic demanded within the gym\u2019s four walls.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to tolerate that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had guys come in who have certain types of attitudes, and they stay for a week, then they\u2019re gone. Big names, too. But instead of being: \u2018Ah we just want the big-name guy to be at our gym,\u2019 we\u2019d rather have characters at our gym. So we try to nip it in the bud from the get-go.\u201d", "description": "Head MMA coach at Las Vegas gym Xtreme Couture Dennis Davis lifts the lid on how he maintains a strong work ethic and a collaborative team spirit.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "George Garcia", "Ken Hathaway", "Nolan King", "Matt Erickson", "Farah Hannoun", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/off-guard-dennis-davis-yt-2.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
