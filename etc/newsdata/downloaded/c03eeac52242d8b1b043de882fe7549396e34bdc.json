Though the 29-year-old lives in mainland China, he was inspired by the demonstrations to write a song about freedom and upload it to the internet. When censors deleted it, he complained to his family.\n\nThey weren\u2019t sympathetic. \u201cHow can you support Hong Kong separatists?\u201d they asked. \u201cHow can you be anti-China?\u201d His mother threatened to disown him. Before Mr. Yang left on a trip to Japan in August, his father said he hoped his son would die there.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s protests have inflamed tensions in the semiautonomous Chinese city, but passions in the mainland have been just as heated \u2014 and, seemingly, almost exclusively against the demonstrators.\n\nA pro-protest tweet by a Houston Rockets executive, Daryl Morey, ignited a firestorm of anger against the N.B.A., demonstrating the depth of feeling. Joe Tsai, the only N.B.A. owner of Chinese descent, said all of China \u2014 yes, more than one billion people \u2014 felt the same way.", "description": "The Communist Party has spent decades preparing the people to defend a united homeland.
