This year, it will take place on Friday 29 November and will last the entire weekend, culminating with Cyber Monday, which is the online-only day of the sale.\n\nLike every other retailer, Amazon\u2019s main Black Friday sale will be on November 29. But its event usually lasts a lot longer than just a long weekend. Last year, the retailer\u2019s sale ran for 10 days, featuring major discounts on everything from electronics to must-have toys, games, fashion, jewellery and beauty products.\n\nNotorious players in the Cyber Monday world too, expect slashed prices on Amazon during the online-only part of the Black Friday period. As the event continues to get bigger and better, here\u2019s our top tips on how to find the best Amazon deals this Black Friday.\n\nOur IndyBest team has hand-picked every deal featured here. We may earn some commission from the links in this article, but our selections have been made independently and without bias. This revenue helps to fund journalism across The Independent.\n\nWhen is Black Friday?\n\nAs the sale falls on November 29 this year, there's less than a month for shoppers to find deals before Christmas.\n\nBut Black Friday deals \u2013 on the high street and online \u2013 begin long before the actual day, from anywhere between the week before to as early as mid October.\n\nWhat were the best Amazon deals last year?\n\nWhile Amazon is expected to offer particularly great deals across tech, fashion and toys, the retailer is notorious for slashing the prices of its own-brand products, with the Echo Dot being the global best-seller last Black Friday/Cyber Monday.\n\nDavid Phelan, The Independent's tech writer says: \u201cThe company\u2019s Echo smart speakers routinely hit their lowest prices on Black Friday, making them exceptional value, especially since they are always sold at or around cost-price outside of the November bunfight.\n\nExpect Amazon\u2019s Fire tablets, Kindle ebook readers and novelties such as the Amazon smart wall clock to become near-irresistible\u201d\n\nAmazon are set to announce new products soon too, so keep your eyes peeled for deals on its latest tech.\n\nHow to get the best Amazon deals\n\nThe key to making the most of this annual event is not getting sucked into deals that look too good to be true. Instead, do your homework and come up with a list of products you're actually interested in. That way, you won\u2019t buy lots of pointless things.\n\nThen shop around for the best price, and make sure you know the actual RRP of the product, so you\u2019ll know a good deal when you see one. To find the original price of a product, use PriceSpy or CamelCamelCamel \u2013 the latter is especially useful for Amazon.\n\nThroughout Amazon\u2019s sale, you can expect to find Deals of the Day which are featured for just 24 hours, Lightning Deals that are featured for several hours and Best Deals which can run for up to two weeks.\n\nSign up to Amazon\u2019s daily deals email to get the best offers sent straight to your inbox. If you want your bargain buys to arrive as soon as possible, register for Amazon Prime ahead of the event.\n\nFinally, be sure to check back in closer to Black Friday where the IndyBest team will be hand-selecting the best deals from a range of retailers, including Amazon, Curry's, John Lewis & Partners and more.\n\nFor more details on Black Friday, check out our guide.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
