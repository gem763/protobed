No amendments can be proposed at this stage, except so-called \u201creasoned amendments\u201d seeking to vote down the whole bill and providing reasons for doing so.\n\nBercow said this course of action was allowed under parliamentary rules.\n\nIf MPs back the bill on Tuesday, then amendments can be proposed later in the legislative process and so there is no guarantee after this first vote that the bill will pass through parliament without conditions attached. Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer has said Labour would put forward amendments for the U.K. to remain in the EU customs union and for a referendum to be attached to Johnson\u2019s deal.\n\nBercow ruled last March that the same parliamentary convention prevented Theresa May from asking MPs to vote on her Brexit deal for the third time. Instead, May decided to separate the two parts of the agreement she had struck with Brussels and asked MPs to vote twice on March 29, first on her Withdrawal Agreement and then on the Political Declaration that sets out how both sides see the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU but is not legally binding.", "description": "MPs will now vote Tuesday on legislation turning the Brexit deal into UK law.", "authors": ["Eleni Courea", "David M.
