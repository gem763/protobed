But the need for workers remains a challenge as unemployment remains at record lows.\n\nThe announcement from the nation\u2019s top manufacturer association is a boon for the White House, which has made training a next-generation workforce a key priority. In 2018, the administration formed the National Council for the American Worker and, in December, unveiled a five-year strategy to improve and expand access to STEM education.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to have NAM make this huge investment into our future and current manufacturers,\" said White House advisor Ivanka Trump. \"By creating pathways for all Americans, regardless of age or background, to acquire the skills needed to secure and retain high-paying jobs, we can maintain our strong competitive edge and ensure inclusive growth and opportunity in our booming economy.\"", "description": "Amazon, Walmart and AT&T are among other firms that have also made a commitment to upskill workers.", "authors": ["Joe Williams"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/06/0/0/caterpillar-factory-texas-ap.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
