Miller is appealing the decision of London\u2019s High Court, which dismissed claims that the suspension of parliament was unlawful. In this respect, the judges will have to consider if the parliamentary business of prorogation is even an issue that the courts can rule on.\n\nMiller challenged the government over Article 50 in 2016, and won the case for the final Brexit deal to be agreed upon by parliament instead of by the government. Miller's case has been endorsed by former Conservative prime minister John Major. Major is expected to give evidence in the case against the government at around 11:00 GMT.\n\nThe second case the Supreme Court will rule on involves the government appeal against a decision made by Scotland's Court of Session. The court in Edinburgh, which applies a different legal system to the rest of the U.K., ruled the prorogation of parliament to be unlawful.\n\nScotland's highest court found that prime minster Boris Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament for almost five weeks stymied debate ahead of Brexit.\n\nOn Thursday the justices from the U.K.\u2019s highest court will decide whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s move to suspend parliament between 10 Sept. - 14 Oct. was legal.\n\nIn the event parliamentary suspension is deemed unlawful, parliament may be recalled with immediate effect with or without the Queen's Speech. If Johnson is found to have misled the Queen when he sought approval for prorogation, he could be made to resign.\n\nSuper 'Supreme Court' Thursday\n\nData released from the Office of National Statistics on Thursday showed that fell unexpectedly in August. Month-over-month retail sales fell by 0.2%.\n\nThe Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee meeting is at 11:00 GMT, it is expected that the U.K. central bank will hold at 0.75%. All MPC members are expected to vote unanimously to steady.\n\nInvestors will be watching GBP pairs following the Supreme Court's ruling and for any indication from the BoE on future rate cuts. The Federal Reserve cut by a quarter point on Wednesday.\n\nAt 09:55 GMT, was flat at 1.2474.\n\nThe Supreme Court hearings and ruling can be watched live in the video link below:\n\nWatch Live: Final Day as U.K. Supreme Court Considers Prorogation Cases", "description": "Watch Live: Final Day as U.K. Supreme Court Considers Prorogation Cases", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC1N0NH_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
