(Matt Dunham/Associated Press)\n\nThe first of three NFL games in England this season takes place today, with the Oakland Raiders and Chicago Bears playing in the spiffy new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nBack in the states, 52 games over the first four weeks have featured at least one starting quarterback age 26 or younger, topping the 1987 mark of 48 through the first four weeks of a season, according to the league. And many of the young quarterbacks are winning, with 39 victories so far.\n\nThe first fours weeks have also featured a drop in turnovers. In each of the last three seasons, according to the NFL, the number of interceptions and fumbles lost through the first four games have been among the lowest marks since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger. There have been 178 turnovers this year, with the record-low of 160 coming in 2017.\n\nThe surprising Detroit Lions and wretched Miami Dolphins have byes in Week 5.\n\n1 Jaguars at Panthers CBS 1 Patriots at Redskins CBS 1 Bills at Titans CBS 1 Ravens at Steelers CBS 1 Cardinals at Bengals Fox 1 Falcons at Texans Fox 1 Buccaneers at Saints Fox 1 Vikings at Giants Fox 1 Bears vs. Raiders in London Fox 1 Jets at Eagles CBS 4:05 Broncos at Chargers CBS 4:25 Packers at Cowboys Fox 8:20 Colts at Chiefs NBC\n\nAll times Eastern.\n\nThe early shift\n\nJaguars (2-2) at Panthers (2-2), 1, CBS\n\nLost in the Minshew Mania sweeping the land (and we\u2019ve got it as bad as anyone) is the fact that Leonard Fournette was the bell cow in last week\u2019s Jaguars victory in Denver, rushing for 225 yards. (He hasn\u2019t scored a TD yet, though.) Carolina will go with second-year pro Kyle Allen at quarterback again, with no timetable set for Cam Newton\u2019s return from a foot injury. In two starts, Allen has completed 43 of 60 passes for 493 yards and four touchdowns, with zero interceptions and a 118.3 passer rating. And then there\u2019s Christian McCaffrey, who had a career-high 37 touches and 179 of the Panthers\u2019 297 total yards in a Week 4 win over the Texans.\n\n[How Gardner Minshew went from college nomad to mustachioed cult hero to NFL\u2019s top rookie]\n\nPatriots (4-0) at Redskins (0-4), 1, CBS\n\nNeed a reason to watch? This is the first time since the Titans and Colts met in 2009 that winless and undefeated teams have played one another on Week 5; it\u2019s only the eighth time that has happened in the last 20 years. New England quarterback Tom Brady wasn\u2019t at his best last week, but the Patriots stayed unbeaten. Perhaps lost in the ugly stats against the Bills (18 of 39 passing for 150 yards, zero touchdowns, one interception and a 45.9 passer rating) was the quarterback\u2019s concession, \u201cI\u2019m no spring chicken.\u201d With 71,575 yards passing, he needs 264 to pass Brett Favre (third with 71,838) and 366 to pass Peyton Manning (second with 71,940) on the all-time yardage list. (Drew Brees, with 74,845, is way out in front.)\n\n[The Redskins are on the verge of a lost season. So what do they do with Dwayne Haskins?]\n\nFor the first time in forever, the Patriots have a question mark at kicker with Stephen Gostkowski out for the year with a hip problem, and Mike Nugent taking his place. They\u2019re also at less than full strength at wide receiver and on the offensive line. In the Redskins, they face a team that wasn\u2019t even sure about its starting QB until Jay Gruden handed the job to Colt McCoy on Friday. The veteran will face a New England team that has not allowed a passing touchdown through four games, a feat no defense has accomplished in the last 30 years. Sounds like a daunting task, but Bill Belichick still slathered on the compliments about Washington.\n\n[Redskins name Colt McCoy the starter at quarterback against New England]\n\nBills (3-1) at Titans (2-2), 1, CBS\n\nThis one looks like a defensive battle between teams ranked fourth (Bills) and fifth (Titans) in points allowed. The Titans haven\u2019t allowed an opponent to score more than 19 points, but their maddeningly uneven offensive play has contributed to that 2-2 start. Marcus Mariota passed for three TDs in Week 1, but Tennessee scored only 17 points in Week 2 against Indianapolis and seven in Week 3 against Jacksonville before bouncing back with 24 against Atlanta, with Mariota again passing for three TDs.\n\nAs good as Buffalo\u2019s defense has been, Tennessee is actually allowing fewer points per game (15.5 to 15.8). Bills quarterback Josh Allen was in the concussion protocol after a helmet-to-helmet hit against the Patriots last week, leaving the Titans to prepare for him and for Matt Barkley. The Bills announced Saturday that Allen had cleared the protocol, and he is expected to play on Sunday.\n\nRavens (2-2) at Steelers (1-3), 1, CBS\n\nThe Ravens have given up over 1,000 yards and 73 points in their past two games. The Ravens! A team known for its defense! What the heck! They spent much of the last week explaining that defensive back Marlon Humphrey really, \u201cdefinitely, did not choke\u201d Odell Beckham Jr. last week. A Ravens-Steelers game is traditionally a knockdown, drag-out affair and this one features a degree of desperation, with Baltimore hoping not to lose its third straight game and Pittsburgh still trying to find its footing without Ben Roethlisberger, Le\u2019Veon Bell and Antonio Brown.\n\n[Best bets for NFL Week 5: Count on the Cowboys, Steelers and Raiders]\n\nCardinals (0-3-1) at Bengals (0-4), 1, Fox\n\nCincinnati\u2019s Zac Taylor is one of four winless first-year head coaches, along with Denver\u2019s Vic Fangio, Miami\u2019s Brian Flores and, yes, Arizona\u2019s Kliff Kingsbury, who at least has a tie. Flores mercifully gets a week off, while Taylor and Kingsbury meet in Cincinnati. The Cardinals are struggling in all three phases and Andy Dalton will face a defense that is ranked 22nd in passing yards allowed and 30th in touchdown passes allowed.\n\nFalcons (1-3) at Texans (2-2), 1, Fox\n\nTexans quarterback Deshaun Watson has been sacked 18 times this season, after being sacked 62 times last year. Watson needs time that the offensive line hasn\u2019t provided; star wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins has caught just 24 passes for 259 yards and two touchdowns. Houston linebacker Whitney Mercilus, who leads the league in quarterback hits with six and forced fumbles with four, has also had five sacks and three tackles for loss. He no doubt has noticed that, against the Titans last week, Atlanta\u2019s offensive line allowed QB Matt Ryan to be sacked five times.\n\nBuccaneers (2-2) at Saints (3-1), 1, Fox\n\nTampa\u2019s Bruce Arians-Jameis Winston collaboration shows progress and, possibly, promise. The quarterback has passed for seven touchdowns (with only two interceptions) in the last two games \u2014 ringing up 55 points on the Rams helped mightily. In the first two games, he threw three interceptions and passed for two TDs. Against the blitz, Winston has completed 31 of 39 passes for 525 yards, with six TDs, zero interceptions and a 158.3 passer rating. The Saints may be one of the league\u2019s smartest teams, with Sean Payton engineering a win with Teddy Bridgewater in Seattle the week after Drew Brees hurt his thumb, and at home against the Cowboys on Sunday night.\n\nVikings (2-2) at Giants (2-2), 1, Fox\n\nGiants rookie Daniel Jones gets a new target, with wide receiver Golden Tate expected to be active after serving a four-game suspension for violating the NFL\u2019s policy on performance-enhancing drugs. Running back Saquon Barkley was practicing in recent days for the first time since hurting his ankle in Week 3, but he won\u2019t play against Minnesota and is targeting a return next week. For the Vikings, quarterback Kirk Cousins has apologized to receiver Adam Thielen for his poor play, but it will take more than that to correct problems that have plagued Cousins \u2014 and the NFL\u2019s great QB carousel of 2018. Cousins\u2019s 99 passing attempts rank last among QBs who have started all four games. Receiver Stefon Diggs is also unhappy, and a question mark.\n\nBears (3-1) at Raiders (2-2) in London, 1, Fox\n\nThe Bears got a break when they learned that quarterback Mitchell Trubisky won\u2019t need surgery for his shoulder injury; for now, Chase Daniel will fill in. The Raiders\u2019 Derek Carr defended linebacker Vontaze Burfict, who is appealing a season-long ban after his helmet-to-helmet hit last week, even as the team moves on. Bears linebacker Roquan Smith says he will play after missing last week\u2019s game because of what Coach Matt Nagy said was a personal issue. Maybe the Bears won\u2019t need him, though, because Khalil Mack is more than stoked to face the team that traded him a year ago. \u201cThis is one I\u2019ve been looking forward to,\u201d he told Yahoo. \u201cI can\u2019t lie to you, man; I\u2019ve got to let you know how it is. It\u2019s going to be a big one.\u201d\n\nJets (0-3) at Eagles (2-2), 1, CBS\n\nJets quarterback Sam Darnold was cleared for practice midweek, but he will miss another game as he recovers from mononucleosis. He\u2019ll be on the sidelines until his spleen is no longer in danger. (\u201cIt\u2019s out of my control,\u201d he said. \u201cMy spleen, at this point, is going to do what it\u2019s going to do.\u201d) With a bye last week, the best-case scenario all along for Darnold was a Week 5 return. Luke Falk will start in his place against Philadelphia. Thanks to replay reversals and goal-line stands, the Eagles came away from Green Bay with a badly needed win last week, and are heavily favored to come up with another one at home.\n\nLate games\n\nBroncos (0-4) at Chargers (2-2), 4:05, CBS\n\nDenver may top the list of hard-luck teams, what with two losses at home on last-second field goals (against the Bears and Jaguars) and losing linebacker Bradley Chubb for the season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament. The Chargers, hoping to get over .500 for the second time this season, have had a slew of injuries, but running back Melvin Gordon is not among them, having stayed healthy during a contract holdout that ended Week 4. He was inactive in last week\u2019s victory over the Dolphins, but will play Sunday, and Coach Anthony Lynn said he was \u201cdefinitely going to have a workload.\u201d\n\n[Finding the next Sean McVay has proved elusive as losses pile up for first-year NFL coaches]\n\nPackers (3-1) at Cowboys (3-1), 4:25, Fox\n\nBoth teams are coming off a loss, with the Packers\u2019 the more troubling of the two. That\u2019s because they\u2019ve been so vulnerable to the run the last three games, news that should perk up Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott and the Cowboys\u2019 offense. Green Bay\u2019s offense will be without receiver Davante Adams (turf toe) and running back Jamaal Williams (head and neck). Still, the Packers do have Aaron Rodgers, who is 6-2 against Dallas as a starter (including the postseason) with 2,371 passing yards, 16 TDs (rushing for another two) and only two interceptions. Prescott has been sacked only three times in four games, but left tackle Tyron Smith is out with an ankle injury, and fellow tackle La\u2019El Collins is also ailing.\n\nThe night game\n\nColts (2-2) at Chiefs (4-0), 8:20, NBC\n\nPatrick Mahomes will look to rebound from a performance against the Lions that, while distinctly un-Mahomes-like, still showed that he\u2019s the NFL\u2019s best QB. He completed 24 of 42 passes for 315 yards, with zero touchdowns and an 81.0 passer rating, more than 50 points lower than his previous worst mark of the season. He also led a last-minute go-ahead scoring drive. In a random oddity, the Colts have rushed for 530 yards in four games, the same number of rushing yards their defense has given up.\n\nRead more on the NFL from The Post:\n\nShaquil Barrett\u2019s historic start puts him on pace to shatter NFL sack record\n\nEven if Vontaze Burfict\u2019s suspension is cut, the NFL sent a message about its safety rules\n\nStefon Diggs is cryptic about his rumored dissatisfaction with the Vikings\n\nBrewer: Russell Wilson is the best quarterback in the NFL\n\nAn NFL player will stop wearing his \u2018Man of God\u2019 headband after the league fined him $7,000\n\nRavens go to great lengths to prove player \u2018definitely did not choke\u2019 Odell Beckham Jr.\n\nKirk Cousins apologizes to Adam Thielen as the NFL\u2019s 2018 QB carousel sputters\n\nNFL power rankings: After the Patriots and Chiefs, it\u2019s a jumbled mess\n\nGiants\u2019 Saquon Barkley, Jets\u2019 Sam Darnold won\u2019t be back in NFL Week 5\n\nVontaze Burfict suspended for the rest of the season for brutal helmet-to-helmet hit\n\nPerspective: Jay Gruden will be fired, but he may be the best man for this particularly awful job", "description": "The first London game of the year (between the Bears and Raiders) and an expected Sunday night shootout between the Chiefs and Colts are among the week's most anticipated games.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories", "October At Am", "Cindy Boren Arrived At The Post In As An Assignment Editor In Charge Of Baseball", "Nfl Redskins Coverage.
