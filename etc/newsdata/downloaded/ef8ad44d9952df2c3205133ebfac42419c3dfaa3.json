The Nation and the Columbia Journalism Review have banded together to found \u201cCovering Climate Now,\u201d a new project supported by some 250 news organizations who vow to \u201cstrengthen the media\u2019s focus on the climate crisis\u201d and produce a week\u2019s worth of stories to underscore that view.\n\nPoint men Mark Hertsgaard, environmental correspondent for The Nation, and Kyle Pope, editor of Columbia\u2019s University media-centric publication, say these participating news organizations have a combined audience of over 1 billion people.\n\n\u201cThe media\u2019s minimization of the looming disaster is one of our great journalistic failures,\u201d the pair advise.\n\nThey believe the press has sidelined climate stories because they are \u201ctoo political or too depressing\u201d; they say the press has been \u201cspun by the fossil fuel industry\u201d and that reporters quote both scientists and \u201cpaid corporate mouthpieces\u201d when it comes to climate matters.\n\n\u201cIt is heartening, then, to report that the press may at last be waking up to the defining story of our time. We believe that Covering Climate Now is the biggest effort ever undertaken to organize the world\u2019s press around a single topic,\u201d the two organizers say.\n\nWhat\u2019s a good example of such journalism? Mr. Hertsgaard and Mr. Pope cite a recent story in The Nation by longtime broadcast commentator Bill Moyers titled \u201cWhat if Reporters Covered the Climate Crisis Like Edward R. Murrow Covered the Start of World War II?\u201d\n\nPerhaps straight facts from both sides of the argument would be helpful to the coverage here, but that is another story.\n\nMeanwhile, the organizers\u2019 intentions are to help media \u201ctell the story so people get it,\u201d and the coverage will continue for better or worse through Monday, the date of the United Nations Climate Action Summit.\n\nAmong the news organizations which have signed on to produce all this enlightened climate fare: Congressional Quarterly, Roll Call, Bloomberg, CBS News. \u201cPBS NewsHour,\u201d Agence France-Presse, San Francisco Chronicle, the Christian Science Monitor, Newsweek, Rolling Stone, Scientific American, Vanity Fair, Slate and BuzzFeed.\n\nREAGAN ON THE CONSTITUTION\n\nTuesday marks Constitution Day. So go ahead. Read the Constitution, or a part of it, or at least mull it over for a few seconds. Meanwhile, here is Ronald Reagan\u2019s advice, delivered exactly 38 years ago on Sept. 17, 1981:\n\n\u201cThe Constitution establishes the Congress, the Executive, and the Judiciary and through a deliberate allocation of authority, it defines the limits of each upon the others. It particularizes the liberties which, as free men and women, we insist upon, and it constrains both federal and state powers to ensure that those precious liberties are faithfully protected. It is our blueprint for freedom, our commitment to ourselves and to each other,\u201d Reagan told the nation.\n\n\u201cIt is by choice, not by imposition, that the Constitution is the supreme law of our land. As we approach the bicentennial of this charter, each of us has a personal obligation to acquaint ourselves with it and with its central role in guiding our nation. While a constitution may set forth rights and liberties, only the citizens can maintain and guarantee those freedoms. Active and informed citizenship is not just a right; it is a duty,\u201d Reagan advised.\n\nHILLSDALE UPS THE ANTE\n\nThe always classy Hillsdale College starts a new era Tuesday. The campus \u2014 which bases its curriculum on the Constitution and founding tenets \u2014 opens the doors for the brand new Steve and Amy Van Andel Graduate School of Government in the nation\u2019s capital. The goal: To offer a Master of Arts in government, combining the study of political thought, American founding principles, and statesmanship.\n\n\u201cToday, the connection between liberty and learning is widely forgotten, and their mutual support has grown tenuous. Repairing the breach is a task both urgent and noble,\u201d says Larry P. Arnn, Hillsdale president.\n\n\u201cOur students will study politics as a human activity oriented toward justice \u2014 a series of choices that require prudence to achieve the best attainable results. Only by knowing the good for which we aim can we then know where we are, what to do, and how to do it,\u201d notes Matthew Spalding, dean of the new school.\n\nThe degree program is ideal for working professionals, as evening and weekend classes are available as are some significant scholarships. Students complete 36 credit hours in political thought and culture, American politics and statecraft. The program is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and licensed to operate in the District of Columbia by the Higher Education Licensure Commission.\n\nClasses begin in January, but the school will offer lectures and courses for a select pilot cohort in the fall 2019 semester.

She recently appeared in New York City at a poetry event. This week, she is showcased in a more political setting.\n\nMrs. Clinton is the keynote speaker Tuesday for an all-day conference in the nation\u2019s capital on the \u201cfuture of democracy\u201d \u2014 the event organized by the Albert Shanker Institute, the American Federation of Teachers, and Onward Together, a political action committee Mrs. Clinton co-founded with Howard Dean after her White House defeat in 2016.\n\n\u201cA lineup of prominent activists, politicians and intellectuals\u201d will also be on hand, organizers say. They include the teacher\u2019s federation president Randi Weingarten; Sen. Ron Wyden, Oregon Democrat; and former Attorney General Eric Holder \u2014 who anchors an afternoon panel \u201cLift Every Voice: Voter Rights and Voter Suppression.\u201d\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 82% of those who expect to vote in the 2020 Republican presidential primary would vote for President Trump if it were held today; 86% of Republicans and 75% of independents agree.\n\n\u2022 4% would vote for former Massachusetts Gov.
