Her parents say the Home Office is failing to tackle the easy availability of the tablets online\n\nThe father of a young woman who died after taking an overdose of diet pills has slammed the Government for failing to tackle their easy availability over the internet.\n\nBethany Shipsey, 21, from Worcester, died after swallowed a number of 2,4-Dinitrophenol (DHP) tablets she had bought online from Ukraine.\n\nHer parents, Doug, 53, and Carole, 58, are angry at the lack of regulation around the pills and says the Home Office is failing to bring in tougher rules.\n\nMr Shipsey believes a licence should be required to acquire or keep DNP, but has been told by his local MP that ministers believe nothing more can be done.\n\nHe said: 'The Home Office have failed to apply appropriate and effective controls of DNP as an explosive, a precursor and a poison, either under existing legislation... or as Controlled and Reportable substances.'\n\nMr Shipsey says the Home Office has stopped replying to his emails in which he has asked for a summary of the actions completed since he met with department officials.\n\nIn one email to the department, he said: 'Save for the involvement that led to an NHS alert which was in any event several years overdue, this is utterly pathetic.'\n\nHer father Doug Shipsey says the substance should be reclassified so that people who have it require a licence\n\nA coroner found 'significant failings' in a hospital's care for Bethany contributed to her death\n\nBethany's family have mounted a campaign to raise awareness of the dangers following her death, with Mr Shipsey even travelling 1,500 miles from Worcester to Ukraine to confront the dealer who sold the fatal pills.\n\nHe told Andrei Shepelev: 'I want you to look into my daughter's eyes and apologise for selling her the pills that killed her.'\n\nBethany was rushed to Worcestershire Royal Hospital following the overdose on February 15, 2017 and suffered a cardiac arrest.\n\nAt an inquest into Bethany's death, Worcestershire coroner Geraint Williams said there were 'significant failings' in the hospital's care but that she had intended to take her own life. But her family dispute this.\n\nHer family say Worcestershire Royal Hospital had an 'inadequate A&E department which was overcrowded, overwhelmed and under-staffed'\n\nSpeaking previously, Mr Shipsey said: 'Beth did not intend to take her own life.\n\n'In addition to the serious failings of the Worcestershire Royal Hospital, Beth's life was brutally cut short by the effects of the deadly industrial toxic substance DNP, which was illegally sold as a so-called diet pill.\n\n'Beth was unlucky enough to be taken to an inadequate A&E department which was overcrowded, overwhelmed and under-staffed - literally a first world hospital in third world circumstances.\n\n'She died on the same trolley which she had been aimlessly wheeled around the A&E department, in and out of the resuscitation room, around the overcrowded corridors which were full of public view. Nothing was done to help save Beth's life.'\n\nBethany suffered from mental health issues after being sexually assaulted by her ex-boyfriend, Barry Finch, who was sentenced to six years in jail in August 2016.\n\nShe had been in the care of mental health professionals for two years but was not considered a suicide risk despite saying it was her fifteenth overdose.", "description": "Bethany Shipsey, from Worcester, died after swallowed a number of 2,4-Dinitrophenol (DHP) tablets she had bought online from Ukraine.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/11/20372546-0-image-a-82_1572436011147.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
