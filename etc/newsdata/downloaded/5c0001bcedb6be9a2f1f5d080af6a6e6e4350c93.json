MacArthur Foundation)\n\nAfter an exhausting day, Jeffrey Gibson thought it was a friend from Chicago calling when he noticed the incoming number. He and his husband were driving through Hudson Valley and pulled over. The service was shaky. Gibson still caught enough of the call to learn he\u2019d been named one of the 2019 John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Fellowship winners. Then his phone died.\n\n\u201cWe rushed to the next town, and I charged my phone enough to call them back,\u201d Gibson, a visual artist, said. \u201cI finished the call and sat there dumbfounded. I\u2019m familiar with MacArthur, but I never even knew how it worked.\u201d\n\nIntriguingly opaque, the yearly prizes \u2014 $625,000 gifts that have come to be known as the \u201cGenius Grants\u201d \u2014 are renowned for elevating the work of a diverse range of relatively obscure artists, academics and social justice advocates. Yet none of the recipients have applied for the honor. Instead, an anonymous selection committee reviews nominations it has fielded from authorities in a variety of disciplines.\n\nThe fellowship is a no-strings-attached award \u2014 there are no reports due to the foundation or future evaluations of progress. It\u2019s an investment in the creative potential of those who\u2019ve already shown what the MacArthur website describes as \u201cthe power of individual creativity to reframe old problems, spur reflection, create new knowledge, and better the world for everyone.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fitting then that among the class of fellows this year, quite a few of them have made careers producing experimental art, reimagining forms, challenging canons and examining the intersections between different traditions and cultures.\n\nGibson, 47, who hails from the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, combines Western contemporary art with indigenous materials and styles in his pieces. In one series, he attaches fringe skirts and colored beads to Everlast punching bags, lending them an almost human shape and undermining the male energy of the boxing gear with campy flair. His goal, he said, is to introduce a visual vocabulary that articulates the diversity and intermingling he sees throughout today\u2019s society.\n\n\u201cThings these days are so cross-referenced, and we haven\u2019t named them,\u201d he said, \u201chaven\u2019t given the language to describe what\u2019s amazing or what\u2019s possible about these new things.\u201d\n\n\n\nOcean Vuong, whose debut novel was a bestseller, is one of the better-known fellows this year.. (The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation)\n\nSometimes a splashy name or two will appear on the roster \u2014 this year it\u2019s Ocean Vuong, 30, the Vietnamese American author whose debut novel, \u201cOn Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous,\u201d was a bestseller, and Elizabeth Anderson, 59, a philosopher and subject of an extensive New Yorker profile earlier this year. But it\u2019s mostly more obscure professionals who receive that legendary late-summer phone call out of the blue.\n\nOther avant-garde artists awarded grants include Sarah Michelson, 55, a choreographer lauded for letting her dancers show the sweat and strain that fuel their art; and Valeria Luiselli, 36, who has blended fiction and essay writing to explore themes of dislocation and translation in her English and Spanish prose.\n\nFor Michelson, the most daunting \u2014 and exciting \u2014 aspect of this honor is the newfound recognition and attention that\u2019s bundled with it. She described herself as working \u201cin very limited ways,\u201d without even social media or a website to promote her personal brand. And yet she was picked, and she remains humbled by the fact.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about being selected in such a serious way,\u201d she said. \u201cNow it feels like I\u2019m working with a face. It gives me that confidence to keep working.\u201d But first, she said, \u201cI want to reach out to everyone who\u2019s ever worked with me, try to get them together and thank them all. Because they\u2019re a part of this, too.\n\nLuiselli said she is working on a multimedia project that moves from written word to audio about the killing of women at the U.S.-Mexico border. She said it was crucial that her work contributes to the public debate about migration. She was riding on Amtrak with her 9-year-old daughter when the foundation came calling. The representative told her to find somewhere private, so she commandeered the bathroom stall. When she returned to her seat, she was beaming. Her daughter wouldn\u2019t let the matter drop.\n\n\u201cI had to confess,\u201d Luiselli said. Before the MacArthur Foundation makes the announcement public, fellows are permitted to let only one other person know of their new distinction. \u201cIt\u2019s okay though. I swore her to secrecy.\u201d\n\n\n\nValeria Luiselli has blended fiction and essay writing to explore themes of dislocation and translation in English and Spanish. (The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation)\n\nPaid in installments over a five-year period, the fellowship\u2019s stipend can be spent in whatever manner the fellow wants. The financial stimulus is a boon for the artists in particular.\n\n\u201cNow I can think a little bigger, realize things before that might not have been possible logistically, financially,\u201d said Mary Halvorson, 38. \u201cI have that freedom of time and space. I also want to study.\u201d\n\nHalvorson is a guitarist, composer and ensemble leader who infuses rock, folk and other musical traditions with her jazz background. Jazz is an inherently experimentative form, she said, developed through eras of cultural exchange and sonic improvisation, and she sees her own work, \u201cas intuitive as possible,\u201d as fitting into that legacy.\n\n\u201cRarely do I think about music theory or a particular method,\u201d she said. \u201cI freestyle on the guitar until I get a nugget of a rhythmic idea, a chord or a melody. Often I\u2019ll have compositions that have weird twists and turns.\u201d Experimental art can seem inaccessible to more casual viewers, Halvorson said \u2014 but wrestling with its knotty structure or themes can offer a break from tired thinking.\n\nAnnie Dorsen, 45, is a theater director who pioneered what she\u2019s labeled \u201calgorithmic theater,\u201d which relies on computer-generated texts produced in real time for every performance \u2014 and thus she never produces the same show twice. One project is based on two bots derived from a Noam Chomsky and Michel Foucault debate discussing human nature; another places audience members under the stars of an inflatable planetarium while a performer recites text culled from chat rooms and message boards. The idea, she said, is to explore how tech and data are shaping the ways people come to know what they know.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a companionship between artist and audience because we experience something new together,\u201d Dorsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s the desire to think and feel through a problem, rather than just be entertained.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNow I can think a little bigger, realize things before that might not have been possible,\u201d says jazz guitarist Mary Halvorson.
