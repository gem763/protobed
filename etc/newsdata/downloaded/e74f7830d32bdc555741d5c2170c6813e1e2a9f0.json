Then, when he turned 67, something clearly changed. It was as if one of his children had dared him to see how many art forms he could try before he was 70.\n\nSince 2016 he\u2019s published a best-selling autobiography, Born To Run. He\u2019s done a one-man show that ran for more than a year on Broadway before landing on Netflix. He\u2019s lent his back catalogue to a modest British film, Blinded By The Light.\n\nAnd now he\u2019s made a movie of his own, featuring an intimate performance of the album Western Stars, which came out in June.\n\nSince 2016 Bruce Springsteen\u2019s published an autobiography. He\u2019s done a one-man show on Broadway before landing on Netflix. And now he\u2019s made a movie of his own\n\nSpringsteen On Broadway worked because it mixed classic songs with funny stories about his early life. Western Stars is not like that. Containing barely a single joke, it\u2019s a concert film that turns into a therapy session.\n\n\u2018In this life,\u2019 Springsteen declares, \u2018nobody gets away unhurt.\u2019 It\u2019s The Boss at his bleakest.\n\nThe message aligns with his grittier albums \u2013 Nebraska, The Ghost Of Tom Joad \u2013 but this time the pill comes with some sugar. Springsteen let his co-director, Thom Zimny, go through his home movies, so there\u2019s charming footage ranging from his parents\u2019 wedding in the Forties to his own honeymoon with Patti Scialfa in 1991.\n\n\u2018Weddings, parties \u2013 ritual, ritual, ritual,\u2019 Springsteen said at a screening in London last weekend. \u2018The things that keep our heads above water.\u2019\n\nThe music is all sweetness and darkness. Western Stars is melodic folk-pop, tipping its cowboy hat to Jimmy Webb and Glen Campbell. Here, to offset the desolate voiceover, the songs come drenched in horns, strings and gospel harmonies.\n\nSpringsteen plays them in a 19th-century barn at his New Jersey home. Some rock stars have yachts; others have barns big enough to contain an orchestra, a band, nine cameramen, an invited audience and a well-stocked bar.\n\nBetween these old wooden walls the songs grow warmer and deeper. A ballad called Stones, repetitive on record, becomes a thing of many layers as Patti and Bruce come together to sing about the moments in a long-lasting marriage when honesty wavers.\n\nThe effect is deliciously haunting.\n\nYou come away liking the album more, understanding it better \u2013 and really hoping the barn is on Airbnb.\n\nThe Divine Comedy\n\nO2 Academy, Oxford\n\nRating:\n\nNeil Hannon of The Divine Comedy writes good tunes and even better jokes. There may be nobody else alive who could pull off a concept album called Office Politics.\n\nOn tour he plays nearly all of it. The chuckles just keep on coming, whether the material is deeply lovable (Norman And Norma) or simply laughable (The Synthesiser Service Centre Super Summer Sale).\n\nNeil Hannon of The Divine Comedy writes good tunes and even better jokes. There may be nobody else alive who could pull off a concept album called Office Politics\n\nOne minute Hannon is No\u00ebl Coward, the next he\u2019s Kurt Weill. Then, on A Lady Of A Certain Age, he\u2019s Peter Sarstedt. Best of all, on To The Rescue, he\u2019s Scott Walker.\n\nTHIS WEEK'S CD RELEASES\n\nBy Adam Woods\n\nElbow Giants Of All Sizes Out now\n\nRating:\n\nThere is a lot of human comfort to be found in this stormy and reflective album. If the backdrop to these songs is heavy \u2013 the demise of close friends, Brexit, a death on a railway line \u2013 Guy Garvey\u2019s treatment is painstakingly compassionate, while the band variously demonstrate their oomph, subtlety and invention\n\nNick Cave And The Bad Seeds Ghosteen Out now\n\nRating:\n\nThis double album of achingly heartfelt songs wreathed in synthesisers, strings, choirs and spiritual imagery, feels like a feverish but oddly calming foray into an imagined afterlife, seemingly inspired by the loss of Cave\u2019s son Arthur. He could sing a shopping list and appear profound\n\nNeil Young & Crazy Horse Colorado Out Friday\n\nRating:\n\nYoung is 73 now and Colorado\u2019s strongest moments are those where the band cuts loose \u2013 the prowling jam of Milky Way or the seething Help Me Lose My Mind \u2013 but the Horse are wasted on limp ditties such as Olden Days or trite anthem Rainbow Of Colors\n\nJames Blunt Once Upon A Mind Out Friday\n\nRating:", "description": "For decades, Bruce Springsteen gave us albums and tours.
