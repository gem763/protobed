Would it be the lawmakers who passed the law? Would it be the judges who rejected legal challenges to it? Would it be the president who championed the initiative on the campaign trail and spent political capital to make it a reality? Perhaps the activists, such as the parents of children killed at Sandy Hook and the teenagers who saw their classmates die in Parkland, would be targeted. The civil servants tasked with implementing the buyback program might have to face this grave danger. So would the cops who come knocking on doors, looking for unaccounted AR-15s.\n\nThis insurrectionist message is not new. Sharron Angle, a far-right Nevada politician, implied that gun-rights advocates might turn violent against Democrats during her 2010 race against then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. \u201cI feel that the Second Amendment is the right to keep and bear arms for our citizenry,\u201d she explained during a radio interview in 2010. \u201cThis not for someone who\u2019s in the military. This not for law enforcement. This is for us. And in fact when you read that Constitution and the founding fathers, they intended this to stop tyranny. This is for us when our government becomes tyrannical.\u201d\n\nThe host interjected to suggest that America might be headed that way. \u201cIf we needed it at any time in history, it might be right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWell it\u2019s to defend ourselves,\u201d Angle continued. \u201cAnd you know, I\u2019m hoping that we\u2019re not getting to Second Amendment remedies. I hope the vote will be the cure for the Harry Reid problems.\u201d Her inflammatory remarks, combined with other controversial stances, helped Reid win re-election that year even as Republicans toppled numerous Democrats a wave election across the country.\n\nJoe Walsh, a former Illinois representative, also invoked the prospect of violence on the eve of the 2016 election. \u201cOn November 8th, I\u2019m voting for Trump,\u201d he wrote on Twitter shortly before Election Day. \u201cOn November 9th, if Trump loses, I\u2019m grabbing my musket. You in?\u201d When CNN anchor Jake Tapper asked him to clarify what he meant, Walsh said he meant \u201cprotesting\u201d and \u201cparticipating in acts of civil disobedience\u201d\u2014two actions where people bearing muskets are typically rare. Walsh now opposes Trump and launched a putative primary challenge against him last month; it\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019ll grab a musket if he loses.\n\nThere is usually a strong taboo against discussing the potential assassination of major American political figures. One out of every eleven U.S. presidents has been murdered in office, and Barack Obama\u2019s historic presidency only amplified those quiet fears. In recent years, however, that sentiment has become less politically toxic in right-wing circles. President Donald Trump once hypothesized on the campaign trail that gun-rights proponents would kill Hillary Clinton if she took office. \u201cIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,\u201d he told a booing crowd in North Carolina in August 2016. \u201cAlthough the Second Amendment people \u2014 maybe there is, I don\u2019t know.\u201d", "description": "The right-wing commentariat keeps warning America that if lawmakers intercede, gun owners will have no choice but to kill cops.", "authors": ["Matt Ford"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/f1fbfdce1cb449c2f9b573809486daf434b28b31.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
