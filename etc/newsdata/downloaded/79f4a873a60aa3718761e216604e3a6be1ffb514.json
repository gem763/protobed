REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo\n\nAs polls indicated he could lose, Trudeau ditched his \u201csunny ways\u201d persona that had swept him to power in 2015 and started hammering away at three smaller parties on the left, warning their supporters that if they didn\u2019t vote Liberal, the progressive vote would splinter and allow the opposition Conservatives to take power.\n\nDuring the last two weeks of the campaign, Trudeau repeatedly told supporters that voting for the rival New Democrats, Bloc Quebecois and Greens would result in a progressive opposition, not a progressive government.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing this because it works,\u201d one Liberal official said of the strategy as the campaign reached its climax last week. He and the three other Liberal aides and strategists in this story declined to be named because they were not authorized to discuss campaign strategy.\n\nRival parties lately complained about what they saw as fear-mongering by Trudeau, who won a healthy minority and should be safe for the next two years.\n\n\u201cThe Liberals like to talk progressive, but they govern conservative,\u201d Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democrats, said on Oct 15. \u201cI want people to dream big. Don\u2019t settle for less.\u201d\n\nFormer Liberal prime minister Paul Martin used the same fear-inspiring technique in the last week of 2004 election, during which he managed to fight off a challenge from the Conservatives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a legitimate strategy by people who want to drive votes toward them based on fear of the worst result,\u201d said Tim Murphy, who was Martin\u2019s chief of staff at the time.\n\nFormer Liberal deputy prime minister John Manley said Monday\u2019s results in the populous province of Ontario, where the party held onto virtually all of its seats, showed the tactic had worked.\n\nSupport for the New Democrats, seen as a major left-leaning challenger in some seats, fell markedly in the last few days, allowing Trudeau to stay in power, he noted.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d rather people voted enthusiastically for you rather than against someone else, but at the end of the day, who won?\u201d Manley said in a phone interview.\n\nNeither the Liberal nor Conservative campaign spokespeople were immediately available for comment.\n\nThe victory was all the more remarkable because Liberal campaign officials had heard from the first day about deep dissatisfaction with Trudeau from long-time supporters.\n\nTrudeau came into the campaign trying to shake off the effects of an ethics scandal and ran into further problems when photos emerged of him wearing black face.\n\n\u201cSome people are telling me \u2018Normally I would vote for you, but a vote for you is a vote for (Trudeau) and I\u2019m not voting for him come hell or high water\u2019,\u201d said one Liberal legislator who declined to be named.\n\nLiberal parliamentarians and strategists described what they saw as a poorly-run campaign that did not focus nearly enough on the party\u2019s economic successes and spent too much time talking about progressive issues.\n\n\u201cThe thing that has absolutely frustrated me the most is that the economy has really been smoking ... and he has not sung that song,\u201d said the Liberal legislator.\n\nThe party presented proposals designed to appeal to voter-rich inner cities, such as a clamp-down on gun violence and a proposal to cut cell phone bills. The polls did not move, much to the consternation of Trudeau officials.\n\nA senior Liberal campaign official said the shift in strategy to a less sunny tone was designed to underscore how different Trudeau\u2019s policies were from those of the Conservatives, especially since the parties were locked in the polls.\n\n\u201cWe knew we first had to establish a plan ... and then be able to say, \u2018These are the things that we want to be able to do, vote for your values, but vote for your values in a way that turns it into action,\u201d the official said.\n\nUnlike 2015, when the Liberals had a year to get ready for the election, two of the Liberal campaign officials said, preparations this time were delayed by months as the party struggled with the pressures of governing and the after-effects of the ethics scandal.\n\nCanada\u2019s independent ethics watchdog found Trudeau had violated ethics rules when he tried to push his former justice minister and attorney general to drop criminal charges against a Quebec engineering company.\n\nThe scandal \u2013 which cut the Liberals\u2019 popularity ahead of the election - also temporarily cost Trudeau the services of close aide and key strategist Gerald Butts, who resigned in February but returned in July.\n\nHe was not present as Trudeau\u2019s inner team started lengthy debates over what the main planks of the platform should be.\n\nIn the end, the Liberals chose a mixture of proposals designed to build upon advances made since 2015 while adding promises for big-ticket items such as expanding a program to provide coverage for the cost of prescription drugs.\n\nIn the last election, Trudeau attracted millions of new voters including women, young people, aboriginals and environmentalists.\n\nSince then, however, Trudeau had alienated various parts of this coalition by ditching plans for electoral reform, forcing two prominent female former ministers out of caucus over the ethics scandal and buying a crude oil pipeline opposed by environmentalists.", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pulled off a second consecutive election win on Monday with a late change in tactics designed to scare progressive voters who showed signs of abandoning Liberal candidates, four Liberal campaign sources said.", "authors": ["David Ljunggren", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444065655&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0QO-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
