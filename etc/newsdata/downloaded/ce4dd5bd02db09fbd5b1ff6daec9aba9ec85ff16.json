Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will also update the public on his outlook in a discussion Friday with the head of the Swiss National Bank.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS At this point, do you think the Federal Reserve should cut rates? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nMarkets already expect the Fed to cut interest rates modestly at the Sept. 17-18 policy meeting. Investors place a 90% probability on a quarter-percentage-point rate cut and a 10% probability on a larger, half-point cut, according to CME Group.\n\nMr. Williams, a top lieutenant to Mr. Powell, didn\u2019t push back against those expectations in his speech. Increased uncertainty, he said, called for \u201cvigilance and flexibility.\u201d\n\nMr. Powell cited weaker global growth, trade uncertainty and muted inflation when he led his colleagues in July to cut interest rates to their current range between 2% and 2.25%. He called the move a midcycle adjustment, adding that it wasn\u2019t necessarily the start of a \u201clong cutting cycle.\u201d\n\nThe global growth and trade outlook has deteriorated since July. U.S. government bond yields dropped sharply after President Trump\u2019s decision to increase tariffs on Chinese imports last month. Beijing responded with retaliatory measures, prompting Mr. Trump to announce further increases in tariffs.\n\nYields on the 10-year Treasury note, which stood at 2.02% after the Fed announced its rate cut on July 31, have fallen to 1.46%, while yields on the two-year Treasury note have dropped to 1.44% from 1.89%.\n\nGlobal manufacturing data have been soft, and revisions to U.S. economic output and employment data suggested the economy is on a slower track than previously thought.\n\nOfficials are set to release new economic and interest-rate projections at the meeting. Officials have stressed that shifts in economic conditions will guide policy changes, meaning they are likely to be open to more stimulus after the next rate cut\u2014just as they were in their postmeeting statement in July.\n\nMr. Powell has weathered unusual and sustained criticism from Mr. Trump for not moving more aggressively to lower rates. The president last month suggested the central bank leader was a bigger enemy to the U.S. than Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nThe Fed chief is weighing mixed advice inside his own institution.\n\nIn July, several regional Fed bank presidents were reluctant to cut rates at all, and two formally dissented against the decision.\n\nSt. Louis Fed President James Bullard, on the other hand, wants the Fed to move rates down more aggressively with a half-point move.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a big inter-meeting move in bonds. Markets are expecting a lot less inflation and a lot less growth than the Fed is,\u201d said Mr. Bullard in an interview Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe should take some signal\u201d from bond markets that indicate \u201cour rate is too high,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m nervous that our policy rate is above every other rate. It is not a good place for the Fed to be.\u201d\n\nBecause markets have largely priced in an additional quarter-point cut at the Fed\u2019s meeting in late October, Mr. Bullard said he saw little reason to delay, if officials concur with investors\u2019 dimmer growth outlook. \u201cWhy not just align that now?\u201d he asked.\n\nOther officials have said the Fed shouldn\u2019t overreact to market signals absent stronger evidence that weakness from the global economy or the manufacturing sector is spreading to the services sector or consumer spending.\n\nRisks facing the U.S. economy are elevated, and it would be appropriate to cut rates aggressively if those risks become reality, said Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren in a speech Tuesday.\n\nFederal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is facing fears of an economic downturn, volatile markets and criticism from President Trump. WSJ's Nick Timiraos explains what pressures weighed on the Fed chief as he headed to this year's annual central bank conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo.
