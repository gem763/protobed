Waves, then a foghorn, then wind\u2014they bleed into one another. There\u2019s a score, too, unsettling and anxious, by Mark Korven, but it\u2019s often hard to discern the music from the noise. This is appropriately destabilizing; The Lighthouse means to rile you.\n\nThe sound design is an important part of any movie, maybe the more so here because the film itself is so hard to see. Clearly that\u2019s by design. Eggers and cinematographer Jarin Blaschke shot The Lighthouse in a near-square ratio and in black and white. It has the feel of artifact\u2014a period piece, set in the late nineteenth century, that is dead set on being a documentary.\n\nThat is obviously impossible. The titular lighthouse is ersatz, built for the production on the coast of Nova Scotia. Still, everything feels real, or at least adheres to our expectations of how that reality looked: wooly sweaters, goofy underwear, sooty faces, bad teeth, dark rooms. Maybe working with history\u2014his first feature, The Witch, was set in Colonial America\u2014allows Eggers access to a time when it was harder to believe the folly that nature could be tamed. Eggers respects and fears nature, both the world around us and the wild within. The roiling waves are some of the most beautiful shots in The Lighthouse, a suggestion that whatever we tell ourselves, nature\u2014human and otherwise\u2014will always win.\n\nThe story begins with an apprentice, Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson), arriving on a desolate island in the company of a seasoned keeper, Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe). As a two-hander it\u2019s closer to Pinter than Shepard, insofar as it\u2019s hard to get a grasp on what, precisely, drives these men into eventual madness (hardly a spoiler; you know it\u2019s coming from the very first shot). Is it isolation? Is it drink? Is it the futility of their task, to conquer the ocean? Do they just not get along or do they desperately want to fuck one another?", "description": "On a desolate island, Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe slow-dance their way to madness.", "authors": ["Rumaan Alam"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/ecd66f08728c728130549e5a59297a47a84cb465.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
