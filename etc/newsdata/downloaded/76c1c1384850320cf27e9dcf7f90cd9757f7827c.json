A 17-year-old boy is under arrest after being turned in by his mother. Tonight she is speaking out.\n\n\"I know a lot of people that go to College Place High School. Their lives would have been forever changed,\" Nicole said. Nicole only wanted us to use her first name. \"It's devastating. I know I did all I can do and that I made the right choice,\" she added.\n\nThat choice was calling the police after finding and reading her son's journal. He wrote about attacking his school on a specific date: April 20, 2020 \u2014 the anniversary of Columbine.\n\nThe journal went into chilling detail. He would detonate pipe bombs, and use multiple firearms to \"blast anyone in sight\" and \"execute survivors.\"\n\nWhen asked how it feels as a mother to turn her son in, Nicole responded, \"Like I've done something wrong.\"\n\nPolice believe she did everything right.\n\n\"She's very courageous,\" said Troy Tomaras, College Place Police Chief. \"It's clearly very emotional for her. She loves her son.\"\n\nNicole said she wrestled with making the phone call to police. She said her son told her it was only a creative writing exercise and that it was all \"just a story.\"\n\n\"Well, he's plotting to attack and kill people. That's beyond creative writing. That's beyond normal,\" said Tomaras.\n\nThe 17-year-old's mother claimed he'd been battling depression.\n\n\"I'm worried about his mental health and he needs help,\" Nicole said, admitting that he's safer right now in jail than at school. \"Truth hurts sometimes.\"\n\n\"It takes a lot to do what I did,\" she said, adding that she still loves her son. \"It wasn't easy.\"\n\nTomaras said Nicole's actions saved people's lives.\n\n\"Absolutely, very courageous, very grateful,\" he said.\n\nSo are all of the students, teachers and staff. They have been saved by possibly the toughest choice a mother can make.", "description": "Before his mother turned him in, the teenager planned the attack to occur on April 20, 2020 \u2060\u2014 the anniversary of Columbine", "authors": ["Jamie Yuccas"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/06/1b015659-3021-4cbb-a789-49dd4b6fcdae/thumbnail/1200x630/014fe39c46bc90fee7c249b424e60d16/1006-en-momturnsson-yuccas3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
