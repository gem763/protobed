The agency said all had been \u201cprepared for testing\u201d but none yet tested at the time of the Sept. 7-8 inspection.\n\nThe nuclear deal was meant to keep Tehran from building atomic weapons in exchange for economic incentives. Its collapse started with the United States unilaterally withdrawing from the deal last year and imposing increased sanctions.\n\nThe other signatories - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia, as well as the European Union - have been struggling to salvage the agreement and find a way to meet Tehran\u2019s demands.\n\nTo put pressure on them, Iran has already pushed past limits in the deal, known as JCPOA for short, on nuclear enrichment purity and stockpiles of enriched uranium.\n\nA centrifuge is a device that enriches uranium by rapidly spinning uranium hexafluoride gas. The IAEA said the ones its inspectors saw included 30 advanced IR-6 and three IR-6s models, as well as multiple IR-4 and IR-5 models.\n\nUnder the atomic accord, Iran has been limited to operating 5,060 older model IR-1 centrifuges.\n\nRussia\u2019s permanent representative to international organizations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, downplayed the development, saying after Iran revealed its step about centrifuges that the move \u201cshouldn\u2019t be overdramatized.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s another deviation from JCPOA, but new activities will remain verifiable by IAEA and reversible,\u201d he said in a tweet. \u201cNo proliferation threat, just a strong signal that balance within the JCPOA must be restored.\u201d\n\nIAEA Acting Director General Cornel Feruta, who returned from Tehran Sunday night, told the agency\u2019s board in Vienna on Monday that inspectors on the ground continue \u201cto verify and monitor Iran\u2019s nuclear-related commitments under the JCPOA.\u201d\n\nHe said he emphasized to Iranian authorities \u201cthe importance of full and timely cooperation by Iran.\u201d\n\nThat mirrored a line in a recent IAEA report on Iran that suggested Tehran wasn\u2019t as forthcoming with answering questions as the agency hoped.\n\n\u201cI also stressed the need for Iran to respond promptly to agency questions related to the completeness of Iran\u2019s safeguards declarations,\u201d Feruta said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The United Nations' atomic watchdog confirmed Monday that Iran is preparing to use more advanced centrifuges, another breach of limits set in the country's unraveling nuclear deal with major powers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Rising"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/austria_iran_nuclear_10229_c0-392-4110-2788_s1770x1032.jpg?cb9a976268eee8e216073fca423fc69b72f38173", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
