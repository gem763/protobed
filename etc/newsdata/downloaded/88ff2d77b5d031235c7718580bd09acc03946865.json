But for the survivors of the 2017 wildfires, two years was barely enough time to begin rebuilding.\n\nDebris removal took time. Geotechnical surveys \u2013 many lots had been so decimated by the flames that they were once again deemed undeveloped land \u2013 took even more time. Then came the geotechnical engineering, and finding architects and contractors, and then getting building permits.\n\nBankrupt California utility blamed for deadly wildfires agrees to $11bn payout Read more\n\nThe coverage the Santa Rosa resident Vita Iskandar has through State Farm expires on 16 October, but construction on her home is not set to be completed until December.\n\n\u201cWe requested a continuation,\u201d said Iskandar, a community organizer who runs the resource-sharing website Neighbors Together Strong and Resilient. \u201cWe requested an extension from our landlord. But what we really have to decide now is if paying out of pocket for rent is worth it, or if we\u2019ll have to camp out of our incomplete home.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Top: firefighters spray water on fire damaged mobile home at the Journey\u2019s End Mobile Home Park on 9 October 2017 in Santa Rosa, California.

The cities and counties were inundated with that first. Then we had to get builders and there aren\u2019t enough builders. There aren\u2019t enough laborers.\u201d\n\nAround Santa Rosa, only 20% of reconstruction has been completed while 62.5% is still in process.\n\nMany of the wildfire survivors call dealing with the insurance companies \u201cthe disaster after the disaster\u201d because of how often they feel retraumatized by the companies\u2019 policy decisions.\n\nFollowing the 2017 wildfires, state legislators increased the 24-month minimum for additional living expense coverage to 36 months, should the policyholder encounter any reconstruction delays beyond their control. But the amendments applied to only those claims that arose on or after the date they were signed into effect, meaning the survivors of the 2017 wildfires remain without recourse.\n\nThe California insurance commissioner, Ricardo Lara, asked insurance companies in May to \u201cconsider this unique situation and the emotional and financial distress of their policyholders by voluntarily agreeing to extend\u201d coverage of the 2017 wildfire survivors to at least 36 months. So far, only Farmers, CSAA and Hartford have agreed to extend coverage, Iskandar said.\n\n\u201cIf rent was the only thing rebuilders had to worry about, that\u2019d be one thing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut many people still have mortgages on their now destroyed homes. Many people had to take out additional loans in order to rebuild or buy elsewhere. There\u2019s a triple burden.\u201d\n\nTwo major insurance companies, State Farm and Nationwide, demurred when asked why they would not extend coverage. Allstate did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cState Farm understands that there are customers facing unique circumstances and situations that are not within their full control,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cIf customers have questions about their claim and policy coverage, we would encourage them to reach out to their claim handler. We will work closely with our customers to address their concerns and see if there is anything more we can do to support them in their recovery process.\u201d\n\nNationwide said in a statement: \u201cAfter a thorough review of the Commissioner\u2019s notice on this topic and all applicable state laws, we have concluded that we are applying the appropriate coverage for each individual based on the insuring contract.\u201d\n\nFor Barbara Nichols, who lost her Santa Rosa home of 31 years in the Tubbs fire, the termination of her coverage meant that she and her husband had to move for the fourth time in two years, into an apartment with cheaper rent. \u201cThe reality is I would have loved to have just stayed put,\u201d she said. \u201cI have stuff piled everywhere. It\u2019s going to take weeks to sort it all out.\u201d\n\nBut construction on her home won\u2019t be done for at least another eight months. Even though the apartment Nichols had before was temporary, it was where an influx of her neighbors ended up after the fire, as well as her brother and sister-in-law. There, they could lean on each other, with other survivors who could understand the unique grief of losing everything you owned.\n\n\u201cIf they had to live this and walk this every day, I think they might feel differently,\u201d Nichols said 0f the insurance companies. \u201cSomeone in an office someplace is making a decision and they\u2019ve never been here. It\u2019s all about the bottom line when we\u2019re just fighting to stay afloat.\u201d", "description": "Insurance money to expire while many residents remain without shelter, amid the slow process of rebuilding", "authors": ["Vivian Ho"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6009f0ad7a650b6756b25d84b733c3cb0de79efb/0_99_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ee98be262ba059e8eafd002054232034", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
