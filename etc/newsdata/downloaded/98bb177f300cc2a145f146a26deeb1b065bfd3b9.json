This was a slog at times, an imprecise grind, but Chelsea\u2019s persistence brought them a reward in the end.\n\nThere were 73 minutes on the clock when they finally managed to break Newcastle United\u2019s stout resistance. The ball had found its way to the excellent Callum Hudson-Odoi and the winger came up with his fourth assist in as many games, teeing up Marcos Alonso to lift Chelsea into the top four with his first goal of the season.\n\nIt had been an uneven display from Chelsea, whose midfield lacked balance without N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, and there were moments when Newcastle threatened to punish their careless opponents on the counterattack. Eager to build on their victory over Manchester United a fortnight ago, Steve Bruce\u2019s struggling side held their own during the first half, threatening whenever their speedy winger Allan Saint-Maximin carried the ball forward on the break during the early stages.\n\nSean and Matty Longstaff were snapping away in midfield, making it difficult for Jorginho to set the tempo for Chelsea, and Newcastle might have taken the lead when Saint-Maximin dinked a cross to the far post from the left, only for the stretching Joelinton to head over. The problem for Newcastle, who slipped back into the bottom three, was failing to test Chelsea\u2019s defence enough.\n\nChelsea had the best opportunities before the break. They were at their most dangerous when Hudson-Odoi was running at DeAndre Yedlin on the Chelsea left and the winger was entitled to expect better when he picked out Willian with a teasing cross in the 16th minute. The Brazilian was unmarked but headed wide from six yards.\n\nHudson-Odoi was involved again moments later, creating space for Mason Mount to swivel and test Martin Dubravka with a powerful effort from 15 yards, but Lampard will not have been fooled: his team had been lethargic before the break. Willian had one of his more infuriating games, Tammy Abraham was well shackled by Newcastle\u2019s back three and Chelsea\u2019s problems increased when Ross Barkley limped off with a foot injury in the 43rd minute.\n\nChelsea raised their intensity at the start of the second half. They pinned Newcastle back and Abraham was unfortunate not to break the deadlock in the 56th minute, heading powerfully against the bar from Willian\u2019s corner.\n\nWith Joelinton increasingly isolated up front, Newcastle found it hard to keep the ball, allowing the pressure to build. Their ambition faded and it became an exercise in attack versus defence, with Chelsea probing for a killer pass and the visitors scrambling to clear their lines.\n\nLampard turned to his bench midway through the second half, replacing Mount with Christian Pulisic, and the American winger ought to have made an instant impact when Hudson-Odoi\u2019s deflected shot squirmed through to him. It was the moment Pulisic had been waiting for, a chance to kickstart his Chelsea career, but Dubravka turned his scuffed shot wide.\n\nYet Lampard will have been heartened to see Pulisic play a prominent role in the game\u2019s decisive moment. The 21-year-old refused to hide after his miss and when his cross from the right reached Hudson-Odoi in the 73rd minute, the England international had the presence of mind to pause and spy Alonso hurtling into space to his left. The pass was weighted perfectly, allowing the left-back to run on to the ball and fizz a low drive underneath Dubravka. Newcastle had finally cracked.", "description": "Marcos Alonso was the only goalscorer as Chelsea edged to a 1-0 win against Newcastle at Stamford Bridge", "authors": ["Jacob Steinberg"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749bdd83826dd406744f0589752725ef333026b8/0_67_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=94f224aa4d32c048309af1d7e4196229", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
