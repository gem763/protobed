They are wrong. Grealish is an artful creator but also a hard and clever worker. Since being made the Aston Villa captain after returning from injury in March, he has led by example. An outstanding performance in the win over Brighton was the latest evidence. \u201cPeople thought the captaincy may be a burden for him, being a Villa fan, but from what I\u2019ve seen he likes the responsibility and thrives on it,\u201d the manager, Dean Smith, said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of our top distance-coverers but also one of our top high-speed runners. Other sides that people don\u2019t see or hear or write about: [against Brighton] he ran 60 yards back to dispossess a player in our penalty box. The quality of the player is there for all to see, and for him to be as good as he is defensively is certainly a bonus for us.\u201d Paul Doyle\n\n\u2022 Match report: Aston Villa 2-1 Brighton\n\n2) Norwich defence still in need of care and attention\n\nIt took nine games for Norwich to find their first clean sheet of the season \u2013 and a first away point \u2013 but it will take more than a decidedly drab draw at Bournemouth to convince that Daniel Farke\u2019s team are capable of closing the back door. Tim Krul, the Norwich goalkeeper, took the acclaim but he had not been overworked by an unusually laboured Bournemouth attack. The Dutchman\u2019s best save was his low stop of an early effort from Dominic Solanke. Krul deflected attention to the contribution of Alex Tettey, whose return to central midfield provided Norwich ballast in front of the defence. Injuries have contributed to their slide into the bottom three and Ben Godfrey limping off in the second half led to Tettey being repurposed into a backline which completed the match without any first-choice central defenders on the pitch.

It felt as if Chelsea were crying out for his hold-up play when struggling to break down Newcastle but Frank Lampard\u2019s decision to introduce the more creative Christian Pulisic paid off when the American played a part in Marcos Alonso\u2019s winner. Giroud was an unused substitute again and that could harden his desire to leave in January. The 33-year-old needs to keep his place in France\u2019s squad for Euro 2020 and he had complained about his lack of opportunities during the international break. Lampard insists that Giroud will get chances. \u201cHe was bang-on with his quotes when he was away with France,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager said. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be happy and accept not playing. That\u2019s what good players do. I would happily sit down with Oli in January but January is a long way away. I want him here.\u201d Jacob Steinberg\n\n\u2022 Match report: Chelsea 1-0 Newcastle\n\n4) Zaha\u2019s failed summer move affecting his form\n\nIt is 10 matches since Wilfried Zaha scored for Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park and his goal against West Ham in February was the only time the forward found the home net throughout last season, despite reaching double figures for the first time in his career. There were some encouraging signs in the defeat against Manchester City on Saturday but Zaha looks as though he is still dwelling over his failed attempt to instigate a transfer in the summer, with Roy Hodgson hoping he can recapture his form ahead of the trip to his summer suitor, Arsenal, on Sunday. With an opportunity to show Unai Emery\u2019s side what they are missing and his 27th birthday approaching next month, Zaha will be only too aware that he must start playing well if he is going to convince anyone to pay what Crystal Palace want to lure him from south London.

Specifically, how the two could be overrun or overpowered by their West Ham counterparts given Gomes was making a first start in seven weeks after injury and Davies his first league start of the season. The duo banished the doubts emphatically, injecting much-needed pace and accuracy into Everton\u2019s passing, giving their forwards freedom to break and dominating Declan Rice and Mark Noble in the opposition midfield. Manuel Pellegrini admitted he would have made 11 substitutions at the interval if he could have done, such was the paucity of West Ham\u2019s performance. Everton\u2019s unlikely central midfield duo, forced on Marco Silva by injuries but also a reflection of the manager\u2019s positivity under pressure, were largely responsible for Pellegrini\u2019s dismay.

Harvey Barnes, 21, created Jamie Vardy\u2019s equaliser before Demarai Gray, 23, crossed for Youri Tielemans\u2019 winner but their manager wants them to be more productive from the start of games. Rodgers said: \u201cOur wingers need to do more. The problem is they are better coming off the bench. This is me being honest. We need more from the players on the sides, so when they come into the game like Demarai, he shows something or does something. We need more from that area both in goals and contributions. There is potential there of course, but there needs to be more efficiency but that\u2019s the beauty of it: they\u2019re young, they have time, they\u2019ll develop and improve.\u201d Peter Lansley\n\n\u2022 Match report: Leicester 2-1 Burnley\n\nLiverpool drop first points but Lallana leveller denies Manchester United Read more\n\n7) Rashford finally shows what is required of the main striker\n\nEven before his goal Marcus Rashford was showing the vigour and threat he has struggled to deliver since Romelu Lukaku was sold and the 21-year-old became United\u2019s main striker. Once a lethargic Liverpool began to step forward midway through the first half, it opened up the game to the counterattacking that is the one discernible hallmark of Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. Extra space provided ideal conditions for Rashford and Daniel James, the combination that supplied the lead United failed to protect. Where lesser opposition have sat deep and then closed down Rashford, following Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s uncharitable advice that his former charge will always look to cut on to his right foot, Liverpool were ravaged by him. Adam Lallana\u2019s goal came after Rashford had left the field, exhausted by the efforts of his best performance in a United shirt in months.

Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores has presided over some disappointing showings since his return so early in the season but after conceding 10 goals in defeats by Manchester City and Wolves, his team have tightened up. The two draws since have been built on more miserly play and Watford stayed compact throughout at Spurs. They will be disappointed in the scrappy way they conceded a late equaliser. Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 was a central figure, an effective screen in front of a new back three, and pivotal in the counterattack, a part of the game where Watford have the ability to hurt opponents more than they have so far. Doucour\u00e9 sprang the press, carried the ball and read the space well for his goal. Watford need more though, namely a forward who can provide a focal point for transitions.

A team who have flirted with relegation for the past two seasons occupy 17th after a draw at Wolves (they are above the bottom three on goal difference). Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl insists the result was a step forward and the performance a platform they can build on but there is little evidence that Saints will avoid another fight for survival. Defensively they appear feeble, with Angus Gunn again unconvincing in goal and the 6ft 6in Jannik Vestergaard walked all over by Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez. \u201cWe can be critical with a few moments in the second half but we can also be positive about a lot of good habits,\u201d said Hasenh\u00fcttl. Danny Ings scored in a fourth consecutive appearance for the first time in his career but Southampton must raise their game if they are to beat Leicester at St Mary\u2019s on Friday. Ben Fisher\n\n\u2022 Match report: Wolves 1-1 Southampton\n\n10) Guardiola needs to solve defensive shortcomings\n\nManchester City are still paying the price for their summer\u2019s transfer business when they failed to fill the gaping holes at centre-back, forcing them to field midfielders Rodri and Fernandinho in front of Ederson. They both have all the requisite attributes to operate in the role but they are no more than a stop-gap and moving them away from their natural position is creating problems elsewhere, something that could easily catch up with them against superior opposition than Crystal Palace. Aymeric Laporte is a long-term absentee, while John Stones and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi cannot be trusted to enjoy a consistent run in the side, which means Pep Guardiola might need to sort his issues out in January rather than risk missing out on trophies in May. Although it will be pleasing to see his converts impress at centre-back, it\u2019s just papering over cracks that look set to widen without treatment.
