(Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nAnd we have Alexandra DeSanctis to prove it.\n\nWhen I want to know the truth about some abortion-related controversy in America, I read National Review.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cRich, you\u2019re the editor in chief, of course you read National Review.\u201d\n\nWell, true, but I still find no other source out there that is as acute and reliable on the topic as the one you\u2019re reading right now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any general-interest publication in America that publishes as much, as consistently, of such stellar quality on this foundational issue as we do.\n\nJust this year we\u2019ve published more than 150 pieces on this topic, and it\u2019s only May.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you want to know the real import of what Ralph Northam said in his infamous radio interview, if you want to know the consequences of extremist pro-abortion legislation in places such as New York, if you want to know the truth about the heartbeat bills, if you want to know the real state of the law, if, in short, you want to know about this issue in all its moral and legal permutations, you must read NR.\n\nIf this coverage means anything to you, I humbly ask that you considered supporting it at whatever level you can.\n\nWe publish the work of Ramesh Ponnuru and David French, who are one-man truth squads on this issue. We publish the work of John McCormack, the only national political reporter in America who consistently holds the feet of pro-abortion politicians to the fire.\n\nBut I mostly want to bring to your attention one of our journalists in particular.\n\nIf you asked me what we especially need in this moment when abortion policy has a new salience \u2014 when the Left is all-in on a no-restrictions absolutism and when Roe might be in play \u2014 I\u2019d say a talented young woman who is passionate about the pro-life cause, extremely knowledgeable, prolific, combative when necessary, and utterly, completely fearless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, I\u2019d say we need Alexandra DeSanctis.\n\nAnd fortunately, we have her. If we didn\u2019t, we would\u2019ve had to invent her in a laboratory.\n\nA goodly portion of those articles I mentioned above were written by Xan (as we call her). She follows this debate obsessively. She lets no BS pass, and is the greatest friend pro-life legislators and advocates have.\n\nShe is extremely versatile. She can write long-form reports on the story behind the Trump administration\u2019s stalwart pro-life policy-making and quick-hit blog posts on the outrage of the hour. She does videos and podcasts, and takes no guff on Twitter.\n\nWe\u2019d like to take credit for \u201cdiscovering\u201d Xan, but it was more like out of Notre Dame, she discovered us. What we\u2019ve done is give her a platform and a lot of running room as she\u2019s done the rest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve been lucky that for about 60 years now such talented young journalists have been finding us. Few things were more gratifying to WFB than growing young talent, and it\u2019s remained a priority of ours to this day.\n\nIt\u2019s just another reason you should consider supporting what we do \u2014 it\u2019s not just for us, it\u2019s for the budding young conservatives who are reading us in high school (as I did) who someday might work here and make a difference for the cause.\n\nWhen you support National Review, you support life. When you support National Review, you support Alexandra DeSanctis. When you support National Review, you support opportunities for young journalists who will influence our public debate for years to come.\n\nAfter Roe v. Wade, we pro-lifers were always supposed to go away. We were on the wrong side of history. The tide of public opinion was sweeping us away. Social issues were costing the Republicans and had to be jettisoned (as we were told in \u201cthe autopsy\u201d and countless other campaign post-mortems).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe never accepted that and never will. We never stopped making the case, not in 1973, not now.\n\nBelow is the entire list of our abortion coverage so far this year as of a couple of days ago, and it\u2019s already out of date. Please consider what these pieces are worth to you. Maybe it\u2019s nothing. Fine. But I expect it\u2019s very important to a lot of you, so I ask you to consider chipping in on the basis of this coverage. Maybe you want to count the pieces accordingly, and think of each piece as worth $.01, or $.10, or $10.\n\nWhatever it is, we will be very grateful and it will go to supporting a publication that has kept the faith on this issue for a long time and is committed to continuing to do so for as long as necessary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThank you very much.\n\nBiden Flips on Hyde Amendment John McCormack, May 20\n\nLove in the First Degree: After the Alabama Abortion Law Kathryn Jean Lopez, May 20\n\nNPR\u2019s Abortion Rules Ramesh Ponnuru, May 20\n\nThe Return of \u2018Abortion Cuts Crime\u2019 Robert VerBruggen, May 20\n\nHeartbeat Bills: The Tactical Question Robert VerBruggen, May 17\n\nThe Equality Act Could Mandate Abortion Funding Alexandra DeSanctis, May 17\n\nIn Missouri, Another Supermajority Passes Another Heartbeat Bill David French, May 17\n\nPro-Life Incrementalism, Continued Ramesh Ponnuru, May 17\n\nSome Thoughts on Overruling Roe Ed Whelan, May 17\n\nWhat Challenging Roe vs. Wade Might Look Like Today Jim Geraghty, May 17\n\nThe 50-Way Abortion Fight Kevin Williamson, May 17\n\nDemocratic Politicians Ignore Pro-Life Women Mona Charen, May 17\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonhood Confusion in the New York Times Ramesh Ponnuru, May 16\n\nHow Best to Protect Life The Editors, May 16\n\nHeartbeat-Bill Opponents Reveal Their Own Incoherence Alexandra DeSanctis, May 16\n\nSlate on Abortion and Democracy Ramesh Ponnuru, May 15\n\nAlabama and Georgia Are Throwing Down the Gauntlet against Roe.
