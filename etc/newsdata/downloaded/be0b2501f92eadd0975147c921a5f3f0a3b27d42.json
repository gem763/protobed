That was pretty f*****g crazy.\u201d\n\nThe band also revealed they could out-party the hardiest rock stars.\n\nKeith said: \u201cThe perception of rock stars is that they\u2019re all about sex, drugs and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, and a boyband is all pretty boys, who are squeaky clean. That was completely f***ing wrong. We were more honest.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cIf you look at a rock band, they\u2019ve got long hair that\u2019s permed \u2014 how are they cooler than us?\n\n\u201cWe had shaved heads and were in the bar until six o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d\n\nRonan told Keith: \u201cI\u2019m sure you put a few rock stars to bed over the years and stayed up afterwards.\u201d\n\nThe band also paid a touching tribute to Stephen, who died in 2009 from an undiagnosed heart condition.\n\nStephen came out in 1999 after learning that his friend was going to out him to the press, and he was one the first ever openly gay young pop stars.\n\nBoyzone called him a \"pioneer\" who paved the way for the pop stars of today who are able to be open about their sexuality.\n\nMikey said: \u201cStephen was a pioneer of breaking that barrier down.\n\n\"Look how much everything has changed in the ten years that we lost him, and even in the years prior to him passing away, when he did come out.\n\n\"Look how much society has changed for the better, with equality across the board.\u201d\n\nThey also said that had he not tragically died, the band could have been even bigger.\n\n(Image: Press Association)\n\nKeith said: \u201cWith Stephen, we were a force to be reckoned with. Had he not lost his life, I believe we would have been a much bigger band.\u201d\n\nShane added: \u201cSteo paid the ultimate price. He lost his life, we lost our buddy. But had he not, I think we could\u2019ve gone on to things we never achieved before.\u201d\n\nBoyzone have been performing their final five shows at the London Palladium before they split for good on Friday night.\n\nThey came to the decision to finalise their split after they created their seventh album, Thank You & Goodnight.\n\n(Image: James McCauley/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nKeith said: \u201cWe kind of felt it was the best work we\u2019d ever done without Stephen and that it felt like a natural end.\n\n\u201cNot only that, we could actually decide ourselves that we want to go out on a high, we want to write our own final chapter. Most bands never get the chance to do that. It fizzles out or it goes away.\u201d\n\nRonan said: \u201cWe\u2019ve never worked a day in our lives in Boyzone. It\u2019s been the absolute dream. We\u2019ve travelled the world, we\u2019ve met amazing people, we\u2019ve entertained. It\u2019s been phenomenal.\n\n\u201cApart from anything else, these last shows are a massive thank you to everybody that supported Boyzone for 26 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been beautiful and brilliant. I hope we leave everybody with great memories.\u201d", "description": "The band have talked openly about their boozy hedonistic days, as well as discussing the tragic death of Stephen Gately", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Getty Images", "Redferns Via Getty Images", "Press Association", "James Mccauley Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20663644.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Boyzone-Portrait-Session.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
