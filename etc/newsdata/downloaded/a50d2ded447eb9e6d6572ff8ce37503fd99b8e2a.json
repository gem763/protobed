But while the trade war has clearly been a headwind to growth, it has been one of several factors weighing on the global economy.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He after announcing a \"phase one\" trade agreement with China.

He\u2019s just poking the guy to see what will happen. Moreover, he\u2019s essentially reduced the U.S-China relationship to the question of who\u2019s selling more dishwashers.\u201d\n\nUS Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer (C) speaks to the press alongside US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin (R) and US President Donald Trump after announcing an initial deal with China. (Photo: NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images) More\n\nShearing estimates that the trade war accounts for approximately 25% of the slowdown in global GDP over the last several years. Other factors include European auto sector problems, \u201cthe unwinding of a particularly large inventory cycle in the electronic sectors,\u201d and policy tightening between the U.S. and China, among other issues at hand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear how this broader shift will develop, but one plausible outcome is that aspects of the global economy start to splinter into U.S. and Chinese-led spheres,\u201d Shearing said. \u201cSuffice it to say that, while this will play out over several years and decades rather than months and quarters, it has the potential to cause much greater damage to the global economy than the current trade dispute.\u201d\n\nAdriana is an associate editor for Yahoo Finance.
