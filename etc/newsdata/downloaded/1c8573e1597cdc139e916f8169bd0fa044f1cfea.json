Climate Strike Leader Who\u2019s Making Life Hard For Her Principal", "language": "en", "text": "A record-breaking drought, water restrictions, and trips to the principal\u2019s office: welcome to the daily life of Australia\u2019s youngest climate activist, who plans to lead tomorrow\u2019s student climate strike in Tamworth.\n\nLucy Lyden, 12, recently spoke with PEDESTRIAN.TV about her involvement in September 20\u2019s School Strike 4 Climate, her hopes for a sustainable future, and yes, her run-ins with authorities at Tamworth Public School.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019m so passionate about, and something that I really believe in. It makes me feel good,\u201d Lyden said of her role in the upcoming School Strike 4 Climate demonstrations.\n\nLyden is the figurehead of Friday\u2019s strike in Tamworth, joining young activists nationwide who will call on the Australian government to take drastic action to mitigate the most severe consequences of climate change.\n\nInspired by teen activist Greta Thunberg and with the backing of parents, Lyden has urged her classmates to call for no new coal, oil or gas projects in Australia, a switch to 100% renewable energy generation, and job transitions for all fossil fuel workers and their communities.\n\nREAD MORE Greta Thunberg Fist-Bumps Obama Before Roasting US Pollies On Climate Change\n\nShe said she has convened weekly meetings leading up to the strike, and has personally recruited roughly a dozen people to the cause.\n\nOf course, not every outreach effort has been so well received.\n\n\u201cI emailed every school in Tamworth to ask to promote the strike at their school,\u201d Lyden said.\n\nShe said the effort attracted the attention of Principal Chris Connor, whose job it is to, well, keep students in school.\n\n\u201cI got called into the principal\u2019s office and he said that he\u2019s not allowed to talk about this sort of issue at school,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo I haven\u2019t got one response from any of the other schools, but I am being optimistic, yes.\u201d\n\nPEDESTRIAN.TV has approached Tamworth Public School for comment.\n\nAs one adult in Lyden\u2019s life tries to keep the strike low-key, another has pledged his full support. Mark Lyden, who sat alongside his daughter during our chat, said he was proud of her for tackling \u201can issue that we adults in the country should notice, and should have noticed years ago.\u201d\n\nThat excitement was tempered by fear. Lucy was born in New South Wales\u2019 hottest decade on record. A full 97% of the state is currently afflicted by drought. When unseasonable bushfires ravaged the state last week, Fire and Rescue NSW commissioner Greg Mullins described the situation as \u201cour new normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about her future, because I\u2019ll be long gone by the time she\u2019s my age, and she\u2019ll be suffering the consequences of our inaction,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd what of Thunberg, who climate deniers have accused of being a puppet for vested interests, or simply a young girl with misplaced fears for the planet?\n\n\u201cTo say this has all got to do with some sort of conspiracy that\u2019s leveraging children, who made their own minds, to sell some sort of unspoken mysterious outcome, maybe in the service of some renewable energy corporation\u2026 I don\u2019t subscribe to it,\u201d Lyden said.\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t accept that because a sixteen-year-old can speak her own mind somebody else is necessarily writing the words for her.\u201d\n\nLucy can speak her own mind, too.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s like, 15 years old, and these 50-year-old men are coming at her, saying how she shouldn\u2019t be doing this.\n\n\u201cI think I saw Andrew Bolt, I can\u2019t remember what he called her, but it was something really revolting.\u201d\n\n(The columnist had described Thunberg as \u201cfreakishly influential\u201d with \u201cso many mental disorders\u201d, but given his vehement defences of Cardinal George Pell, we can probably ignore what he thinks about children.)\n\nYes Andrew Bolt is revolting\u2026Lucy talking to channel 9 from down town Peel Street. Posted by Tamworth School Strike for Climate Action on Friday, 6 September 2019\n\nThat Thunberg can \u201cstep up at the UN and talk about how important this issue is to them, I think it\u2019s really amazing,\u201d Lyden said.\n\nIt seems something amazing is happening in Tamworth, too.\n\nIf you\u2019re keen to join Lucy on the strike, check out the event page here.", "description": "Lucy Lyden, who is half my age, is leading September 20's demonstration in Tamworth.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/lucy-lyden-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
