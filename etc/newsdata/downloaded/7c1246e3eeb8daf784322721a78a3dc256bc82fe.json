It offered residents the freeholds to their properties at no charge as part of an out-of-court settlement.\n\nCampaigners now argue all its leasehold customers across the country should receive similar compensation.\n\nBut in a letter sent to customers and seen by the Mail, the company rejected claims householders were misled.\n\nIt claimed staff would have explained the terms of the homes to customers during the sales process, that their solicitor should have advised them about it and that mortgage lenders would have also assessed the property at the time.\n\nA separate survey by the Solicitors Regulation Authority also found one fifth of people sold leasehold properties were not even told the difference between leasehold and freehold homes.\n\nMPs called for an investigation into possible mis-selling. They lambasted solicitors for being too cosy with developers and failing to warn clients about the rip-off deals.\n\nFollowing their report, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched a probe.\n\nSir Gary Streeter, Tory MP for South West Devon, accused the firm of telling 'blatant' lies to leaseholders in Plymouth, part of his constituency, during the sales process.\n\nA Persimmon spokesman insisted the decision to 'gift' ownership to leaseholders in Cardiff was 'not to do with the mis-selling of leasehold properties', adding: 'We firmly dispute the fact that the customers were not aware the properties were being sold on a leasehold basis.\n\nAny suggestion that the decision by Persimmon to gift the freeholds was in relation to mis-selling of leaseholds is false and misleading.'\n\n'All customers buying leasehold properties are informed by the sales team at the time of purchase that the properties are leasehold and not freehold.'", "description": "Hundreds of its customers now claim they are trapped by increasing rent bills that have made it impossible to sell.
