Irish electricity company ESB has selected simulation technology firm Akselos to build a digital version of the hydro station, which will let operators manage the infrastructure more efficiently and ultimately, it hopes, increase the plant's life expectancy.\n\nThe digital twin is one of the five pilot projects that ESB is running as part of the Free Electrons Accelerator Programme \u2013 an initiative that digs up and supports startups innovating in the energy market.\n\nAkselos said its technology has been in an ongoing development in partnership with MIT for over 15 years. It creates accurate simulations of large structures that use real-time data from IoT sensors to keep operators informed of the structure's current condition \u2013 and to predict the outcome of future scenarios based on changes to parameters like materials, geometry or loads.\n\nSEE: Sensor'd enterprise: IoT, ML, and big data (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)\n\nUltimately, this should mean lower operating expenses and better management of the infrastructure. According to the company, it has recently helped Shell add 20 years of operating life to one of its ageing offshore platforms in the North Sea.\n\nThe plan for Turlough Hill is based on similar objectives: \"Akselos will be able to deliver significant value to Turlough Hill by enabling operations beyond its design life. We have already delivered positive results in the short time we have been working on the project with the delivery of a digital twin of the penstock and manifold,\" said Andrew Young, VP of projects at Akselos.\n\nImage: ESB\n\nDigital twins are not a new concept: engineers already use them to simulate various phenomena, usually in the design phase of products, to reduce the number of prototypes and experiments.\n\nThe traditional method for this is finite element analysis (FEA) \u2013 but Akselos claims its technology, called reduced-basis finite element analysis (RB-FEA), is up to 1,000 times faster.\n\nYoung told ZDNet: \"FEA allows you to simulate the behaviour of one component, like a joint, a connection, or a pipe \u2013 so it is incredibly time-consuming to look at various scenarios for an entire structure.\n\n\"Because our technology is much faster, we can consider all those scenarios in a matter of hours.\"\n\nSEE: What are digital twins?\n\nThis in turn means it can integrate sensor information and provide data-based analysis about the interactions happening between all the components in a given structure; and crucially, that it can be scaled for much larger platforms.\n\nWhere FEA was used for car pumps or compressors, for example, RB-FEA can be applied to model the infrastructure of entire power plants, as it will be in Turlough Hill.\n\nIn addition to building a digital alter ego for one of Shell's gas terminals in the North Sea, Akselos completed last year a $10 million financing round with the support of Shell Ventures as co-investor.\n\nIn the case of Turlough Hill, the technology will benefit the ESB's grid stabilisation, as Ireland recently committed to reducing emissions by 80% before 2050. And in the future, said Young, the plan is to increasingly apply Akselos to renewable energy infrastructure.
