But eventually there was so much hand-wringing and such a hot-take flurry over where Jones was drafted that it\u2019s all nearly been forgotten now.\n\nJones entered the 2018 season as something of a curiosity who checked off a lot of scouting boxes. He had good size, athleticism, intelligence and was being groomed by QB whisperer David Cutcliffe. That\u2019s a good start for a potential NFL passer.\n\nHis production had been underwhelming to that point, despite starting for two years, amassing a 30-20 TD-INT ratio in 2016 and 2017 combined. But Jones was viewed in the NFL community last summer (and in select pockets of the Twitter draft mob) as a bad-stats-with-good-tools prospect who carried enough intrigue to receive extra sets of scouting eyes on him.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAnd Jones was off to a terrific start last season before suffering a collarbone injury at Northwestern in the team\u2019s second game, which knocked him out for three weeks. The fact that he missed only two games before returning to the field spoke to his underrated toughness.\n\nSomewhere along the way people lost their minds about Jones, ourselves not excluded to a degree, and we think we know the source of some of that.\n\nWhere I had Daniel Jones ranked\n\nLet\u2019s get this part out of the way: I had Duke\u2019s Daniel Jones ranked as the 56th overall prospect on my 2019 NFL draft board. That assessment isn\u2019t necessarily cut down by the fact that:\n\n\n\n1. Jones was drafted sixth overall by the New York Giants OR\n\n2. Jones had himself a darned good first NFL start in the Giants\u2019 dramatic win Sunday over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking back requires context, and perhaps a little recalibration. It\u2019s fair to say that quite a few people took glee in ripping Jones going off the board as early as he did, and in the extremely early going Jones has measured up well against the criticism.\n\nMy view of Jones was surprisingly uncluttered. As tough as prospects\u2019 intangibles can be to measure at times, Jones\u2019 were clear-cut in a few respects. He was football smart and real-life smart. Running Cutcliffe\u2019s offense requires a thinker, and Jones passed that test.\n\nThe toughness Jones showed in a good first half at Virginia Tech, his first game back and only 21 days removed from the broken clavicle, was impressive. It was one of my favorite games to watch of him last season. Again, same story: not great stats, but pretty darned good tape.\n\nDaniel Jones struggled against Clemson and certainly didn't win over the draft-analyst community. (Getty Images)\n\nWatch any Duke game last year, however, and it was obvious that his receivers and offensive line repeatedly let him down. I don\u2019t care what QB was in that system, they just could not have thrived amid the dropped passes and countless pressures.\n\nJones finished last season completing 60.5 percent of his passes with a 22-9 TD-INT ratio, much of that thanks to a brilliant bowl game against Temple. In that game, he completed 30 of 41 passes (73.2 percent) for 423 yards with five touchdowns and two picks.\n\nThat seemed to ease concerns about Jones after averaging fewer than 4.0 yards per attempt in the two duds he delivered in Duke\u2019s prior two losses to Clemson and Wake Forest. Jones never had a chance in either one, but he didn\u2019t play great regardless. A poor game at Miami also raised some fair doubts about his game.\n\nWhen Jones declared for the draft, it\u2019s fair to say that analysts weren\u2019t exactly sure what to do with him. The possibility of him being taken in Round 1 in January was an opinion that was shared mostly in hushed voices.\n\nWhere things changed a bit for me on Daniel Jones\n\nThe Senior Bowl is where I became more ambivalent about the fourth-year junior\u2019s draft value. Putting too much value into a postseason all-star performance is a slippery slope. It comes right after a long season, about a month after players have last played football. It\u2019s a brand-new offense with new coaches, teammates and even footballs. Adapting on the fly is not easy for any prospect.\n\nBut he failed the eye test. Watching him throw in the same group as Missouri\u2019s Drew Lock, North Carolina State\u2019s Ryan Finley and West Virginia\u2019s Will Grier showed that his arm talent was not nearly as good as Lock\u2019s. Also, Jones kept misfiring on passes and dropping his head in disappointment.\n\nIn the two practice sessions I watched in person in Mobile, Alabama (in addition to watching a third session on tape of the practice that was rained out and off limits to media), Lock looked the best, with Finley and Jones neck and neck, followed by Grier on the North Team coached by the Oakland Raiders and Jon Gruden.\n\nGiants general manager Dave Gettleman is said to have watched Jones throw at one of those practice sessions and after 20 minutes said to himself something along the lines of, as he would later explain to the media, Now that\u2019s a professional quarterback. I must have been off watching the defensive linemen at that point of practice or something.\n\nGruden and his staff that week seemingly talked up Lock (and even Finley) more than they talked up Jones. Some of that might have been the Raiders\u2019 own subterfuge, but I don\u2019t know about that. And just listening to the even-keeled, mild-mannered Jones speak during media sessions, it was hard not to come away with an impression ... the dude sounded like Eli Manning.\n\nListening to Daniel Jones is EXACTLY like listening to Eli Manning\n\n\n\nLike a more baritone version but otherwise spot on \u2014 Eric Edholm (@Eric_Edholm) January 22, 2019\n\nLock started the Senior Bowl game at week\u2019s end, which was reflective of the pecking order the Raiders had. Funny enough, Jones came to life in the game and was named the North Offensive MVP. That earned him a draft bump, but that was only after I had knocked him down a few pegs with the week of practice, which scouts tend to weigh more heavily.\n\nWas I a little hard on Jones, ending up putting him at 56? Perhaps. But the way others tore him down during the pre-draft process made me feel better. I never killed the kid. I saw serious flaws in his game and a clear ceiling in his potential.\n\nOne NFL start won\u2019t change my assessment from then, and I am not backpedalling now. Besides, you kids with your screenshots and your Frozen Takes Twitter accounts ... I know I am not escaping you.\n\nWhy were some draft analysts so hard on Jones?\n\nThere were a few things at play here. Bear with me while we unpack some of them.\n\nBy virtue of being groomed by Cutcliffe, and thus being pulled in under the Manning family umbrella, Jones was viewed with some serious suspicion by the draft community. There was a sense of nepotism at work, as if Cutcliffe was trading in favors with his old NFL buddies.\n\nOr perhaps it was a function of Jones appearing to not perfectly fit the mold of the newfangled run-pass quarterbacks who were populating college football and finally starting to get their shots as NFL starters.\n\nThe funny thing is, anyone who bothered to watch the North Carolina tape would know that when given the chance to run, Jones could roll. He ran 15 times that game for 186 yards and a 61-yard TD that put Duke up for good late in the third quarter. But Jones certainly fit the Ryan Tannehill mold more than he even did the Josh Allen mold.\n\nDaniel Jones had an up-and-down week at the 2019 Reese's Senior Bowl. (Getty Images)\n\nWith Allen, the draft vultures swooped hard and fast and killed the Buffalo Bills for trading up to the No. 7 spot to take him in 2018. Jones became last cycle\u2019s Allen, if you will, even if their skills were quite different. Allen had a rocket arm \u2014 everyone could see that \u2014 and was a risk taker. Jones was far more safe in his play and had, by NFL standards anyway, an average arm.\n\nAs much as I love my fellow draft analysts, there tends to be a hive mentality on prospects \u2014 especially on Twitter. If one highly respected analyst rips a player, many others are emboldened to follow suit. Reputations there are hard to change. Prospects turn into memes. The whole thing can get a bit silly.\n\nStill, it\u2019s not as if Jones didn\u2019t have holes in his game. All prospects do. The intrigue had soured like room-temp milk. It was just his whole package that felt uninspiring to many. I stood in lockstep with that view, too, so we\u2019re not casting aspersions at others without indicting ourselves in the process.\n\nThis is the fascinating Rorschach test: If you knew a prospect would be guaranteed to be Eli Manning in the NFL, would you draft him at No. 6?\n\nSure, you\u2019d miss on a potential game-changer, but you also would be getting a guy who would start 15 years, never miss a game to injury and have the potential to get hot a few years and lead long, deep playoff runs.\n\nHonestly, you might be dumb not to draft that guy at No. 6.\n\nHint: It had something to do with the guy who drafted Jones, too\n\nWith the New York Giants picking in that No. 6 slot, it was already going to be an awful sell. Gettleman had been low-hanging fruit for both the national and local media a year after bypassing a quarterback (in a QB-rich draft) and taking a running back. He was the easy mark for ripping into a blue-blood franchise that had appeared to fall into disrepair.\n\nNever mind that Saquon Barkley displayed elite ability as a rookie \u2014 that pick was still viewed as an old-school, out-of-touch positional valuation from the draft literati. And perhaps that is true from a certain perspective, with quality running backs emerging from some surprising places and with lower-round picks.\n\nGettleman also seemed to enjoy publicly needling the new-school, analytics-heavy community with his personnel worldview, one that contrasted starkly with their highly evolved draft philosophies. That didn\u2019t exactly endear many to the idea that Gettleman was the right man to select Manning\u2019s successor.\n\nSo when the Giants \u2014 holding pick Nos. 6 and 17 in Round 1 \u2014 were the team most connected to Jones in the run-up to the draft, it became a feast. Suddenly, Jones\u2019 virtues went completely out the window and in came a flurry of Gettleman-bashing columns with Jones pulled into the collateral-damage undertow.\n\nThe Giants taking Duke quarterback Daniel Jones at No. 6 in the 2019 NFL draft was roundly panned. (Getty Images)\n\nIt was a perfect storm. Giants fans, knowing the team needed a QB to one day replace Manning, booed the Jones pick when he was announced at a Yankees game. Hey, maybe those were Jets fans there that night. Maybe Giants fans who booed (lightly) wanted a pass rusher at six and Jones at 17. Maybe some didn\u2019t want him at all. Maybe they hadn\u2019t seen him throw a single college pass, for all we know.\n\nAnd perhaps the new-school draft folks who hated Jones coming out will have the last laugh. He\u2019s had one start. Marcus Mariota had a brilliant first start. So did Robert Griffin III. Brock Osweiler, Charlie Frye, Matt McGloin, Tim Rattay, even Todd freakin\u2019 Bouman \u2014 it\u2019s not hard to scan the boxscores of some quarterbacks\u2019 first starts and find some darned good ones from players who later turned into frogs.\n\nEven Jones\u2019 first game gave us some warning signs. We wrote in March that Jones needed to \u201cspeed up his clock against the blitz and develop his downfield timing and accuracy.\u201d That still holds true. I also wrote the caveat that that \u201cJones lacks a great arm,\u201d which still applies. I even feel good about saying that Jones \u201clikely wouldn\u2019t embarrass himself if thrust into the lineup early in his career,\u201d which is how it played out on Sunday against a 1-1 opponent on the road.\n\nSo why 56th overall? Even though I projected two months before the draft that Jones could end up going in the upper parts of Round 1, my final evaluation boiled down to this feeling I had watching him: \u201cThere are enough limitations in his game to ever imagine him becoming great.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m still there. If you want to bookmark this page and smear it in my face five years from now after Jones is celebrating his second Super Bowl title, I will let you have your moment. Eli Manning supporters likely enjoyed similar schadenfreude a generation ago.\n\nBut was Eli ever great great? Maybe that\u2019s the debate we\u2019ll end up having with Jones, too.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Daniel Jones was the clear whipping boy of the 2019 NFL draft among fans and draft analysts.
