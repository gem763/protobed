Spontaneously, she booked a ticket to Mexico City, a part of the country she\u2019d never visited. The trip seemed likely to be lonely: She knew only one person in the city, vaguely at best. But she was determined.\n\n\u201cI wanted to go. I needed to go,\u201d Ms. Leahy said, sounding like a woman who had planned one too many family vacations. \u201cWhy wait?\u201d\n\nThis trip was the first time she\u2019d ever traveled alone other than professionally. She stayed in the Habita Hotel in Polanco and visited the Diego Rivera mural at the Palacio Nacional. She wandered the city three or four hours a day, heeding no schedule. One afternoon she went clothes shopping. Another she lay out by the pool on the hotel\u2019s roof and drank margaritas.\n\n\u201cI was surprised how OK I was being alone,\u201d said Ms. Leahy. \u201cI tend to be pretty social. But it was nice to just decide to come back to the room and read for a while.\u201d\n\nA Flash Pack group in Jordan\u2019s Wadi Rum.

Solo travel has shed its stigma and moved into the mainstream. In a Travelex Insurance survey, one in four Americans reported that they\u2019ve traveled alone and nearly half said they\u2019d like to travel solo more in the future. According to Google Trends, use of the search term \u201csolo travel\u201d has doubled since 2014. We are increasingly a nation of people living alone. Today, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 35.7 million Americans live alone. That\u2019s 28% of households, up from 13% of households in 1960.\n\nFamous Flocks Some travelers prefer the company of others, many others The Pope travels with 100 or so people including a valet, a cook, a butler, lots of priests and lots of Swiss guards. King Salman bin Abdulaziz al Saud of Saudi Arabia has been known to visit other countries in Asia with about 1,500 companions, as well as several Mercedes. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge don\u2019t just tote their tots, but travel with 12 staff, including hairdressers, secretaries and a security detail.\n\nThe era of having to justify why you\u2019d want to travel alone a la \u201cEat Pray Love\u201d or \u201cInto the Wild\u201d is gone. Being alone can now be seen an expression of sanity and self-worth. Busy professionals in their 40s who venture off without friends or family report that it\u2019s the least stressful, least labor-intensive way to travel. Men and women in retirement travel alone because they have items on their bucket list that hold no interest for their spouses.\n\nMillennials seem to be leading the way, but \u201cSolo travel no longer means you are single,\u201d said Robin Brooks, director of marketing at U.K.-based Exodus Travels who says she sees more married people traveling alone. \u201cOne person in a couple might be really into cycling, another might want to climb Kilimanjaro. We all have our unique interests. Just because you love someone doesn\u2019t mean you can travel with them.\u201d\n\nMatt Short lives in Austin, Texas, works in the tech industry and is a father to two children under the age of five. He tries to spend a total of about two weeks a year traveling alone. Since airports remind him of work, he often jumps in his car and goes out to West Texas for three or four days. His wife, who has a startup and works long hours, also takes vacations by herself. Each partner gets time to decompress, while the other spends time, at least some of it \u201cquality time,\u201d alone with the children.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Ever taken off on your own and left colleagues, friends or family behind to forge your own adventure? Where did you go, and what was the experience like? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cI travel all the time for work but it\u2019s never with intent,\u201d said Mr. Short, noting that men are behind women in the concept of self-care. \u201cWhen I go to Marfa, I read a book, watch a movie my wife might not like, sit by the pool\u2026.it doesn\u2019t have to be exotic. Travel is about self-discovery,\u201d he said.\n\nIn these hyperconnected times, you can be alone but hardly lonely. You can whip out a phone in a three-star restaurant and barely get a glance from a waiter\u2014someone\u2019s creating the more than 5 million posts with #solotravel on Instagram. Or you can rent an apartment with a kitchen and avoid the semi-dread of eating another restaurant meal alone. Airbnb reports the number of solo travel home-bookings has risen nearly four fold since 2015.\n\nRoyce Vavrek, a New York City opera librettist who travels often for work and frequently rents apartments, credits the rise in vacation rentals for enabling his own spree of solo trips. He recently returned to Prague, a city he has visited before, to get some writing done. He spent five days wandering the streets and getting lost in the crowds. He went to his favorite pastry shop and clothing store. He did nothing touristy. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be accountable to nobody but yourself,\u201d said Mr. Vavrek. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect indulgence.\u201d\n\nWomen, it seems, indulge even more than men. Forty-two percent of the high-end travel agencies that are part of the Virtuoso network reported a rise in bookings from lone female travelers. The online site Solo Female Traveler Network, which counts nearly 300,000 members on its Facebook page, is a lively forum for trading advice and safety tips\u2014a primary concern for lone female travelers. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand the culture and customs. Dress appropriately. It can really make or break a trip,\u201d said the site\u2019s founder, Amanda Black, adding that both men and women should have a plan when they visit a new place. \u201cSpontaneity is great and all but do your research. And keep your street smarts,\u201d said Ms. Black.\n\nPonant, the luxury French cruise company, waives the single supplement on certain trips, including several to South and Central America and the Caribbean. Photo: PONANT\n\nTravelers who\u2019d rather leave the research and safety precautions to others are likely to sign onto organized tours or cruises. Many also prefer the social aspect of group trips. Travel companies are starting to notice. A growing number of tour operators and cruise lines are discounting or even eliminating the dreaded single supplement, the fee that\u2019s charged to solo travelers for taking up a room designed for two. Abercrombie & Kent cuts its single supplement 50% some seasons, even for cruises to Antarctica. Great Plains Conservation is a safari operator that only charges a single supplement for safaris in Kenya, Zimbabwe and Botswana during the high season. If you book your trip in the low or shoulder season (any time other than over Christmas or June 15-Oct. 31) the 50% supplement is waived. Norwegian Cruise Line offers \u201cstudio\u201d staterooms on six of its ships designed specifically for solo travelers, which means they don\u2019t charge a single supplement. Passengers stay in the private studio area where they have access to their own lounge, a good place to meet other solo travelers for happy hour.\n\nOn land, well-heeled loners tend to gravitate to nicer hotels where the staff are tuned in to the sensitivities of single guests. Nicola Shepherd, a woman in the travel industry who often travels alone, was recently at the Ritz in London. She sat down at the bar and her friend was late. \u201cYou get that uh-oh moment,\u201d said Ms. Shepherd of the feeling of being left alone at a bar. \u201cI ordered a glass a Champagne, and the bartender automatically offered me a newspaper. He put me at ease.\u201d\n\nLess lofty hotels are following this lead, training staff to look out for solo travelers and designing spaces intended to make them comfortable. The Moxy hotels in New York\u2019s Times Square and Chelsea neighborhoods create spaces in the lobbies for solo travelers to use their computers. The bars are big and spacious, designed for eating alone. Chris Orlikowski, the director of PR for the COMO hotels says management keeps an eye on solo diners; bartenders and waiters may stop to chat a moment.\n\n\u201cYou are a curiosity a little,\u201d says Molly Dunn, a brand strategist from New York who both lives alone and travels alone. \u201cPeople talk to you more when you travel on your own. Sometimes they stare at you. Say strange things. There is a vulnerability.\u201d Recently she was in London having dinner and a stranger approached her and asked if she was a news anchor. \u201cI was like, I have to take off this blazer,\u201d said Ms. Dunn, laughing. For her, and many other serial solo travelers, the vulnerability is worth it.\n\nALONE TOGETHER\n\nA Few of the Companies That Are Especially Welcoming To Solo Travelers\n\nAbercrombie & Kent, the storied travel operator, offers a 50% reduction in the single supplement (the surcharge for lone travelers who occupy a room meant for two) on a variety of trips, many of which occur in the off or shoulder season. These small group tours go on safaris in Africa, tours in Europe, as well as cruises (from $18,888 for a 13-day expedition cruise to the Antarctica, abercrombiekent.com).\n\nFlash Pack creates luxury and adventure trips for solo travelers ages 30-49. Destinations include Angor Wat, Botswana and the Arctic circle (from $2,300 for an 8-day trip to Jordan, flashpack.com)\n\nGreat Plains Conservation, a Cape Town-based safari operator, only charges a single supplement for trips in Kenya, Zimbabwe and Botswana during the high season. If you book your trip in the low or shoulder season, the 50% supplement is waived (greatplainsconservation.com)\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line was one of the first cruise lines to offer rooms for the solo traveler. Singles can reserve a studio cabin and avoid the single supplement on six ships (ncl.com).\n\nPonant, a French luxury cruise company that specializes in small ships that go to exotic places, waives its single supplement\u2014on certain trips. Solo travelers can book a double room and pay a single fee for the cruise. Destinations include South and Central America, the Caribbean and an Atlantic crossing to Africa (From $14,320 for a single on an 11-day trip to Antarctica, but as little as $1,970 for a 9-day trip from Patagonia to Easter Island, ponant.com)\n\nA League of Their Own\n\nRenowned solo travelers had several things in common\u2014a hunger for adventure, little patience with their fellow human beings and an affinity for self-promotion. Here are some of our favorites.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nMark Twain\n\nThis father of American letters actually spent much of his life abroad.

Though she emerged alive, these trips became inspiration for her famous book, \u201cMurder on the Orient Express.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nAmelia Earhart\n\nMost solo travelers talk to someone in the course of the day, a cabdriver, a waiter, the hotel concierge. Amelia Earhart flew a single-engine prop plane across the North Atlantic in 1932. No chitchat for her. Just 15 hours of buffeting winds, blue ocean and, possibly, prayer.\n\nPhoto: Elise Str\u00f8mseng\n\nThe Arctic Fox\n\nLast winter an Arctic fox trekked more than 2,175 miles from Norway to Canada in 76 days.
