(AP) - A cloud of disappointment lingers over the Tampa Bay Lightning with no signs of dissipating.\n\nLast season\u2019s Presidents\u2019 Trophy winners were swept in the first round of the NHL playoffs, and captain Steven Stamkos says there are no words to adequately describe what a longer than anticipated summer has been for a team that matched the league record for regular season victories before collapsing at the most important time of the year.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough feeling for a lot of us who had aspirations of much bigger things. \u2026 But it\u2019s a time for everyone to reflect, get stronger, get that fire back and come (back) with a different perspective and a new attitude,\u201d said Stamkos, who is entering his 12th season.\n\n\u201cWe could sit there and pout in a corner but it\u2019s not going to change anything that happened last year,\u201d the six-time All-Star added. \u201cI\u2019m hoping guys come in with that extra motivation and a little chip on their shoulder because I know I will.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s any consolation, the 1995-96 Detroit Red Wings, who also won 62 games before falling short of winning the championship, rebounded the following season to win the Stanley Cup.\n\nIt\u2019ll take a similar response from the Lightning to erase the pain of being swept from the postseason by the Columbus Blue Jackets last spring.\n\nThey certainly have the talent to do it, beginning with Stamkos, reigning league MVP and leading scorer Nikita Kucherov, Vezina Trophy winner Andrei Vasilevskiy, and Brayden Point, who signed a new three-year contract worth an average of $6.75 million per season on Monday.\n\n\u201cLast year was a very successful year in terms of wins in the regular season and in terms of a lot of individuals having tremendous years and being recognized for that. It\u2019s great and deserving for sure but the goal here is to win a championship,\u201d Stamkos said.\n\n\u201cBut in saying that you can\u2019t get ahead of yourself. We need to, if anything, take a step back and realize the opportunity we have with the amount of talent we have on this team,\u201d Stamkos added. \u201cIt really is the toughest trophy to win in sports, and we need realize how tough that is and not just expect it.\u201d\n\nDespite last season\u2019s record-breaking success, general manager Julien BriseBois didn\u2019t stand pat in the months following the playoff collapse, adding veteran defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk, backup goalie Curtis McElhinney and forward Pat Maroon to an already deep and talented roster.\n\nMaroon helped the St. Louis Blues win their first Stanley Cup title.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to win a Stanley Cup, as we\u2019ve learned and I\u2019ve learned in my career,\u201d defenseman Ryan McDonagh said. \u201cSo to bring a guy in who\u2019s done it, and done it so recently, he understands the ups and downs that go on throughout the season and when your back is against the wall, how you come out of that and overcome those things. \u2026 Hopefully, he can shed some light on what works and help push us in the right direction.\u201d\n\nWHO\u2019S HERE\n\nD Kevin Shattenkirk, F Pat Maroon. G Curtis McElhinney.\n\nWHO\u2019S NOT\n\nD Anton Stralman, D Dan Girardi, F J.T. Miller, F Adam Erne, F Ryan Callahan\n\nKEY PLAYERS\n\nOnce again, scoring doesn\u2019t figure to be an issue. Kucherov led the NHL with 128 points en route to capturing the Hart Trophy last season. Stamkos and Point had 40-plus goals, too, finishing with 98 and 92 points, respectively. Throw in Tyler Johnson and the Lightning have firepower to burn. The defense, led by 2018 Norris Trophy winner Victor Hedman and McDonagh, is solid as well. Vasilevskiy was 39-10-4 with a .925 save percentage and 2.40 goals against average. He\u2019ll be backed up by McElhinney, who signed as a free agent after spending last season with the Carolina Hurricanes.\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nIt\u2019s Stanley Cup or bust after last season\u2019s playoff collapse.\n\nPREDICTION\n\nDespite a talent-laden roster, It will be difficult duplicate last year\u2019s regular-season success. And even if the Lightning does claim another Presidents\u2019 Trophy, it will mean little unless they not only can get back to the Stanley Cup Final for the first time since 2015 - but win it all.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A cloud of disappointment lingers over the Tampa Bay Lightning with no signs of dissipating.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Fred Goodall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/lightning_point_hockey_55379_c0-231-3828-2462_s1770x1032.jpg?21d0474b9929af065f412de105eb5f2dbee28123", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
