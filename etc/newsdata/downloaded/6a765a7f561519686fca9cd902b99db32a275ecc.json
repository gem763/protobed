Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d What followed was an absolute fiasco that, by Monday, had morphed into a full-blown international incident involving U.S. senators and presidential candidates.\n\nMorey is the longtime general manager of the NBA\u2019s Houston Rockets, a team that developed a large presence and fanbase in China after drafting Chinese star Yao Ming in 2002. Morey was voicing his support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, who for months have been demonstrating for months against Beijing\u2019s encroaching power in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.\n\nChina brought the hammer down on the Rockets after Morey\u2019s tweet, which he quickly deleted. The Chinese Basketball Association and Tencent Sports, which streams NBA games in China, cut ties with the Rockets. Sportswear brand Li-Ning, sponsor SPD Bank, and other Chinese businesses suspended their relationships with the franchise as well. Chinese fans posted angry messages in response to Morey\u2019s tweet, which quickly went viral in China.\n\nMorey tweeted the Hong Kong message as the team was in the middle of a preseason trip in Japan. Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta quickly tried to walk it back.\n\n\u201cListen, Daryl Morey does NOT speak for the Houston Rockets,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cOur presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization.\u201d\n\nREAD: Where the Hong Kong protests stand after 100 Days: rubber bullets, petrol bombs, and 5 demands\n\nThe NBA walked the line carefully, throwing mild support behind Morey while also making sure to placate China.\n\n\u201cWhile Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals\u2019 educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them,\u201d read a statement from the league on Sunday.\n\nBut folks were quick to point a Chinese language version of the statement said the league was \"extremely disappointed in the inappropriate comment.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a sign of the NBA\u2019s reluctance to piss off China, a huge market with millions upon millions of basketball fans. The league is focusing on growing its presence in the country, and the NBA\u2019s biggest stars often spend a good portion of their offseason in China, making inroads with fans and hawking sneakers. As a result, the full-court press from the Chinese government and Chinese fans put a lot of pressure on Houston.\n\nMorey apologized for the tweet on Sunday, saying he \u201cdid not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China\u201d and that he was \u201cmerely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event.\u201d\n\nREAD: Hong Kong's face mask ban is just pissing people off\n\nBut Morey\u2019s apology didn\u2019t solve anything, and by Monday, the firestorm had only grown in scope. The two-sentence, mostly generic tweet from Morey had taken on a life of its own. U.S. senators like Ted Cruz, Ben Sasse and Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer, for instance, all rushed to condemn the NBA for not standing up to China.\n\n\u201cNo one should implement a gag rule on Americans speaking out for freedom,\u201d tweeted Schumer.\n\nHouston star and former NBA MVP James Harden tried to smooth things over on Monday, saying to ESPN that the Rockets appreciates their Chinese fans. And that means saying they\u2019re sorry for his own GM\u2019s support of pro-Democracy protesters.\n\n\"We apologize,\u201d Harden said.\u201cYou know, we love China. We love playing there.\u201d\n\nCover: Houston Rockets shooting guard James Harden (13) gets by Los Angeles Clippers shooting guard Jerome Robinson (1) during the first quarter of an NBA preseason basketball game, Thursday, Oct 3, 2019, in Honolulu.
