As a child, it prevented her from making friends as she preferred to stay at home. As she grew older, it became worse, framing her as aloof and detached. Aged 20, she fell and fractured her knee badly. Four operations later, the pain hadn\u2019t subsided so her doctor prescribed her tramadol, an opioid pain medication.\n\nOpioids work by attaching to receptors across the body. They block pain messages sent from the source of the pain through the spinal cord to the brain whilst also creating feelings of well-being and euphoria. The tramadol didn\u2019t just help ease Melissa\u2019s knee pain in the short term, for the first time it lifted her out of the fog of anxiety. In her own words, \u201cIt made me feel beautiful.\u201d As her tolerance increased, Melissa started seeking out more tramadol. She lied to her doctor that she\u2019d lost her prescription, she bought more from online pharmacies as well as from a drug dealer. She went from taking eight tablets a day to 90. She stopped eating and lost four stone in weight, \u201cI didn\u2019t care about my life much, I just wanted to feel calm.\u201d In my work for drug treatment charity Addaction, Melissa\u2019s story is becoming more and more common.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

World's 10 deadliest street drugs 1/10 Whoonga Whoonga is a combination of antiretroviral drugs, used to treat HIV, and various cutting agents such as detergents and poisons. The drug is widely available in South Africa due to South Africa\u2019s high rate of HIV sufferers, and is believed to be popular due to how cheap it is when compared to prescribed antiretrovirals. The drug is highly addictive and can cause major health issues such as internal bleeding, stomach ulcers and ultimately death Getty 2/10 Scopolamine Scopolamine is a derivative from the nightshade plant found in the Northern Indian region of South America (Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela). It is generally found in a refined powder form, but can also be found as a tea. The drug is more often used by criminals due its high toxicity level (one gram is believed to be able to kill up to 20 people) making it a strong poison. However, it is also believed that the drug is blown into the faces of unexpecting victims, later causing them to lose all sense of self-control and becoming incapable of forming memories during the time they are under the influence of the drug. This tactic has reportedly been used by gangs in Colombia where there have been reports of people using scopolamine as way to convince victims to rob their own homes 3/10 Heroin Founded in 1874 by C. R. Alder Wright, heroin is one of the world\u2019s oldest drugs. Originally it was prescribed as a strong painkiller used to treat chronic pain and physical trauma. However in 1971 it was made illegal under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Since then it has become one of the most destructive substances in the world, tearing apart communities and destroying families. The side effects of heroin include inflammation of the gums, cold sweats, a weak immune system, muscular weakness and insomnia. It can also damage blood vessels which can later cause gangrene if left untreated 4/10 Crack cocaine Crack cocaine first came about in the 1980\u2019s when cocaine became a widespread commodity within the drug trafficking world. Originally cocaine would have attracted a high price tag due to its rarity and difficulty to produce, but once it became more widespread the price dropped significantly. This resulted in drug dealers forming their cocaine into rock like shapes by using baking soda as a way of distilling the powder down into rock form. People were doing this because it allowed for them to sell cocaine at a lower quantity and to a higher number of people. The side effects of crack cocaine include liver, kidney and lung damage, as well as permanent damage to blood vessels, which can often lead to heart attacks, strokes, and ultimately death 5/10 Crystal meth Not just famous because of a certain Walter H White, but also because it is one of the most destructive drugs in the world. First developed in 1887, it became widely used during the Second World War when both sides would give it to their troops to keep them awake. It is also believed that the Japanese gave it to their Kamikaze pilots before their suicide missions. After the war crystal meth was prescribed as a diet aid and remained legal until the 1970s. Since then it has fallen into the hands of Mexican gangs and has become a worldwide phenomenon, spreading throughout Europe and Asia. The effects of crystal meth are devastating. In the short-term users will become sleep depraved and anxious, and in the long-term it will cause their flesh to sink, as well as brain damage and damage of the blood vessels 6/10 AH-7921 AH-7921 is a synthetic opioid that was previously available to legally purchase online from vendors until it became a Class A in January 2015. The drug is believed to have 80% of the potency of morphine, and became known as the \u2018legal heroin\u2019. While there has only been one death related to AH-7921 in the UK, it is believed to be highly dangerous and capable of causing respiratory arrest and gangrene 7/10 Flakka Flakka is a stimulant with a similar chemical make-up to the amphetamine-like drug found in bath salts. While the drug was originally marketed as a legal high alternative to ecstasy, the effects are significantly different. The user will feel an elevated heart rate, enhanced emotions, and, if enough is digested, strong hallucinations. The drug can cause permanent psychological damage due to it affecting the mood regulating neurons that keep the mind\u2019s serotonin and dopamine in check, as well as possibly causing heart failure 8/10 Bath salts Bath salts are a synthetic crystalline drug that is prevalent in the US. While they may sound harmless, they certainly aren\u2019t the sort of salts you drop into a warm bath when having a relaxing night in, they are most similar to mephedrone, and have recently been featured throughout social media due to the \u2018zombification\u2019 of its. The name comes from the fact that the drug was originally sold online, and widely disguised as bath salts. The side effects include unusual psychiatric behaviour, psychosis, panic attacks and violent behaviour, as well as the possibility of a heart attack and an elevated body temperature 9/10 Purple Drank One of the more unusual drugs around at the moment, purple drank was popularised in 90s hip hop culture, with the likes of Jay Z and Big Moe all mentioning it in their songs. It is a concoction of soda water, sweets and cold medicine, and is drunk due to cold medicines high codeine content, which gives the user a woozy feeling. However it can also cause respiratory issues and heart failure 10/10 Krokodil Krokodil is Russia\u2019s secret addiction. It is believed that over one million Russians are addicted to the drug. Users of krokodil are attracted to the drug due to its low price; it is sold at \u00a320 a gram while heroin is sold for \u00a360. However, krokodil is considered more dangerous than heroin because it is often homemade, with ingredients including painkillers, iodine, lighter fluid and industrial cleaning agents. This chemical make-up makes the drug highly dangerous and likely to cause gangrene, and eventually rotting of the flesh 1/10 Whoonga Whoonga is a combination of antiretroviral drugs, used to treat HIV, and various cutting agents such as detergents and poisons.

From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nPrescriptions for opioid-based painkillers have increased by more than 60 per cent in the past decade. Official statistics show tramadol was implicated in 220 drug-related deaths in England 2018 compared to just seven in 1998. And oxycodone, the drug at the centre of the epidemic in America, was implicated in 79 deaths in England in 2018 compared to zero 10 years earlier. With this in mind, people are inevitably comparing the situation here with the epidemic across the pond. Let\u2019s be clear, opioid prescribing is monitored much more closely in the UK than in the US, meaning the situation here is nowhere near as severe. But that doesn\u2019t mean we should become complacent in the face of what is clearly a growing issue.\n\nPublic Health England are currently reviewing practices around prescribing drugs. But the government\u2019s main tangible response so far has been introducing prominent health warnings on boxes of opioid painkillers. This might help to inform patients that the drugs are potentially addictive, but it doesn\u2019t help those who have already developed a problem with their medication. Addiction is a craving for a relief from suffering. It\u2019s characterised by someone continuing their behaviour despite the negative consequences. This could be the gambler who applies for a payday loan to keep on betting or Melissa buying more and more tramadol at the expense of her health. Long-term opioid use is a way of papering over the cracks of a much deeper emotional problem. The search for that rush of pleasure is always likely to trump potential health complications.\n\nThat\u2019s why prescribers need to thoroughly understand whether a patient has any underlying mental health problems before prescribing opioids. This is especially true for pain lasting longer than three months. So-called chronic pain often has no obvious ongoing cause and is frequently accompanied by anxiety and depression. The evidence tells us that opioid-based painkillers are largely ineffective in treating this complex condition. But, particularly in the UK\u2019s most deprived communities, prescribing rates are increasing. Rather than over medicalising what are often social problems, we need to look at the bigger picture. Part of the response needs to be focused on making people\u2019s lives better through better-funded treatment and mental health services as well as access to better housing and employment opportunities.\n\nBut drug treatment organisations also need to do more to help people access support. Ten years after her doctor first prescribed her tramadol, Melissa walked through the door of an Addaction service. During her assessment she started shaking and lost consciousness before she collapsed and stopped breathing. She was given the opioid overdose reversal drug naloxone and taken to hospital, before coming back to finish her assessment the next day. She could well have died if she\u2019d waited any longer.\n\nThere\u2019s a misapprehension among many people that they too need to hit this kind of \u201crock bottom\u201d before reaching out for help. In actual fact, anyone who\u2019s concerned about their drug use should access treatment. People who use prescription opioids often don\u2019t see themselves in the same light as a heroin or crack cocaine user but they need the same level of support. As a sector we need to rise to the challenge and do more to reach out to this group.\n\nMelissa is now taking care of herself again. She\u2019s seeing a counsellor to address her anxiety rather than medicating it with tramadol. She still has ups and downs but says some days she\u2019s \u201cshocked at how well I\u2019m doing.\u201d Her advice to anyone worried about their use of painkillers is to \u201cwork out whether they\u2019re actually taking them for pain or for other reasons.\u201d If it\u2019s the latter, it\u2019s never too early to reach out for help.\n\n*The person\u2019s name has been changed to protect their identity.\n\nRachel Britton is lead clinical pharmacist at Addaction", "description": "Melissa* has lived with anxiety for as long as she can remember.
