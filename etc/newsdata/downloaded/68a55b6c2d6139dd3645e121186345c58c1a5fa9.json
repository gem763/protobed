The sun fell in bright shards through the treetops, but it was cool high up in the mountains, and the air was sweet with the smell of pine, fir and spruce.\n\nGertrude \u2014 known as Gertie \u2014 was wearing a Stetson hat, kerchief, lumberjack shirt, sheepskin chaps and boots. Her rifle lay across her lap, gripped tightly at the trigger guard as she waited in the vast silence for the sound of hoofbeats.\n\nGertrude \u201cGertie\u201d Legendre with future husband Sidney, right, and others in Abyssinia in 1928-29.\n\nWhile most of her classmates were celebrating their high school graduations with debutante parties in New York City, 18-year-old Gertie instead insisted on an adventure out west. Shooting had been a part of her life since she\u2019d picked off birds as a young girl wintering at the family home in South Carolina; she was an excellent markswoman before she reached her teens. Later, at the all-girl Foxcroft boarding school in Middleburg, Va., she foxhunted, went beagling after rabbits and tracked raccoons at night under the tutelage of the principal. It was an education in which \u201coutdoor life \u2026 was as important as the \u2018finishing\u2019 touches that we were receiving,\u201d Gertie recalled in a 1987 memoir.\n\nIn Wyoming, Gertie\u2019s party hired a pack train of ponies and, with a young cowboy as a guide, started to climb into the Tetons. Several days in, Gertie shot and killed a bull elk for the first time. \u201cI was filled with pride and the exultation of success,\u201d she later wrote. \u201cI strode in to camp \u2014 all five feet five of me, every inch the successful huntress.\u201d\n\nOver the next seven years, Gertie would continue to hunt in Alaska and Canada \u2014 black and Kodiak bears, moose, caribou, mountain sheep and goats. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t gone on that first trip to the Tetons, I might never have known the thrill of life in the wilderness,\u201d she said. Gertie enjoyed what she described as her \u201cown safe extravagant world\u201d gilded by great wealth \u2014 her family\u2019s carpet and flooring business generated enormous resources \u2014 but felt that she \u201cwasn\u2019t going to be like most of the girls I knew. I wanted something different, something more than the social whirl.\u201d\n\nGertie in an undated photograph.\n\nTo be a woman in early 20th-century America and indulge that kind of restlessness and adventurous spirit was an unconventional thing, yet Gertie had the wealth and determination to push back at the gender norms that bound many of her contemporaries. Throughout the 1930s, she led multiple grueling hunting expeditions in Africa and Asia and never faltered while some of those around her collapsed in exhaustion. (Her husband, Sidney Legendre, wasn\u2019t quite as enamored of the outdoor life: \u201cI am not what you would call a vital person,\u201d he said.) At the beginning of World War II, she took a job \u2014 her first paid employment \u2014 to help the war effort but railed at the disparities in pay between men and women. \u201cWhat burns me up the most is the unbelievable lack of confidence in a woman\u2019s ability,\u201d she said in a letter to her husband. \u201cMen cannot bear to have their world encroached on by more efficient women. They hate to give way, they hate to admit they are good, they hate to give them power. It fairly drives me nuts.\u201d\n\nPrioritizing adventure and globe-trotting over raising a family, Gertie bracingly actualized her personal philosophy: \u201cI don\u2019t contemplate life; I live it.\u201d All but forgotten today, she was an unlikely feminist antihero \u2014 one whose hunger for experience would come with high costs: It would, eventually, steer her toward danger in wartime Europe, jeopardizing multiple lives and imperiling some of America\u2019s most closely held secrets.\n\nGertie with friends in London in 1944.\n\nOn Dec. 7, 1941, Sidney was reading the newspaper in the gun room at Medway, the couple\u2019s plantation outside Charleston, S.C., when the phone rang. \u201cHave you got your radio turned on?\u201d his brother Morris shouted.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Sidney.\n\n\u201cThen turn it on; the Japs are bombing Honolulu and have sunk some of our boats.\u201d\n\nLike much of the country, Gertie was dumbstruck, even though the flames of war had been consuming Asia and Europe. The fabulous world Gertie inhabited was upended; the American idyll was over.\n\nSidney was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Navy Reserve in early April 1942 and assigned to intelligence duties in Hawaii. Gertie also wanted to contribute. She sent a three-page r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to her friend F. Trubee Davison, a former assistant secretary of war, in which she noted the number of countries she had visited, that she could shoot a rifle and a shotgun, spoke French fluently, and had considerable experience with outdoor photography, including the ability to develop and print her own work. \u201cI am physically fit,\u201d she explained. \u201cCan walk 20 miles a day. Have unusual endurance and exceptional health.\u201d\n\nGertie in East Africa in 1927-28.\n\nDavison wrote back that he had one possible lead for her: the new spy organization led by William \u201cWild Bill\u201d Donovan called the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Her background security check noted that \u201csubject\u2019s family have always been prominent socially and are reputed to have been extremely wealthy\u201d and described her as being \u201c100% loyal to her country,\u201d as well as \u201ca person of unusual ability, energy, courage and resourcefulness. It has been said of her that she can \u2018hold her own with any man, in shooting or riding.\u2019 \u201d\n\nGertie was hired and found a house in Georgetown for herself, her 2-year-old daughter, the child\u2019s nurse and a housekeeper. (Gertie and Sidney\u2019s other daughter, then 9, was sent to the Foxcroft School, about 50 miles away in Virginia.) At first, Gertie was excited by her work and described her agency as \u201chot stuff.\u201d Her job was to route all cables in and out of the OSS\u2019s Secret Intelligence Branch, which gave her a broad if glancing view of OSS operations. On her desk was a battery of rubber stamps: \u201cRESTRICTED,\u201d \u201cCONFIDENTIAL,\u201d \u201cSECRET.\u201d\n\nBut soon, the first blush of her new life began to fade. She was desperate to join Sidney in Hawaii and plotted at every turn to make it happen, even though the Navy did not allow the wives of officers to join their husbands. Washington became unbearable to her \u2014 \u201cpurgatory pure and simple. The crowds, the noise, the grey grim atmosphere.\u201d\n\nWith Hawaii closed off, Gertie turned her attention to getting another posting. Donovan promised a foreign assignment, possibly to London or Cairo. \u201cI told Col. D that London was OK and I would like to go,\u201d Gertie wrote to her husband. \u201cI was really thrilled because my darling if I can\u2019t get to you I would rather be \u2018in the war\u2019 close to things than stay here in this dreary town for the duration.\u201d\n\nSidney was generally supportive of Gertie going to London but asked her to consider what it would mean for their children. Gertie noted in letters back that the girls would summer in Rhode Island without her in any case, and she was signing up for only six months; the separation might be short-lived.\n\nAs her younger daughter, Bokara, later said, she \u201cdidn\u2019t much like children around.\u201d Depending on their age, they lived separately in rented cottages and apartments with their nanny or at boarding school, visiting their parents on holidays and occasional weekends. Mothering was not her priority, Gertie told her husband in a letter. The \u201cworlds to conquer type of thing always appeals to me, change, motion, new possibilities, new heights \u2026 it\u2019s my restlessness, my wander lust, my desire not to stay put forever in the same spot with the same scene, the same people and the same everything.\u201d\n\nGertie and Sidney Legendre and their dog in an undated photograph.\n\nIn London, Gertie handled cables for all OSS sections. As each afternoon waned, a bell rang to draw the curtains when a nightly blackout descended on the city; London was being bombed, with air raid sirens blaring. Negotiating her way home with the help of a small faint torch in the pitch black was a challenge. \u201cIt\u2019s black in the morning, black at night, and we live like moles all week,\u201d Gertie told her husband.\n\nWhen Sidney suggested some months later that Gertie end her tour, she rejected the idea. The limited six-month visit she had first spoken about was forgotten. Gertie was in for the long haul. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I go back to Virginia and be with the kids? No doubt that is what I should do, and maybe that is my duty \u2014 but I just couldn\u2019t go back and live in the country alone without you. It would be frightful. \u2026 I far prefer Europe to Washington (which is my idea of the worst place on earth).\u201d\n\nAfter D-Day, Gertie felt restless. As early as November 1943, she had contacted an American friend about renting an apartment in Paris, all in anticipation of the liberation. \u201cEvery big shot I know is over there in the thick of it and I do feel so left out on the outer fringe of it all,\u201d she told Sidney. \u201cGee I wish I were a man so often \u2014 because then I wouldn\u2019t be relegated to the sidelines.\u201d\n\nFinally, in September 1944, she got her wish: orders to join the new OSS office in Paris, where she would also manage communications. Gertie feared that the military campaign would end before she could witness the U.S. Army on the march. \u201cHer obsession was to see the battle,\u201d recalled a friend, who described her as \u201ccompletely fearless\u201d and with \u201cthe vitality of ten men.\u201d\n\nGertie Sanford married Sidney Legendre in 1929 in New York.\n\nWhen she got to Paris, the OSS building was still being renovated, so the arrivals from London were free to roam. \u201cDuring the day, I walked around Paris, amazed at how beautiful it still was,\u201d Gertie recalled. The renovations were slow going, so her boss decided to give some of the staff a formal five-day leave. It was her first official break in more than a year, and she wanted \u201cto turn up something interesting to do.\u201d\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 22, she stopped in to the famous Hotel Ritz, where she found herself in the company of a group of American reporters. They were leaving the next day for Luxembourg, near where elements of the Third Army under Gen. George Patton were headquartered. The chattering reporters prompted a stab of envy. \u201cI wanted so desperately to see troops on the move, to actually feel the urgency of war, and to know more of what it really meant,\u201d Gertie said.\n\nGertie spotted Bob Jennings, a wiry, sandy-haired Navy officer and World War I aviator. He was a friend of her husband\u2019s; Gertie also knew him from London, where they had met several times at cocktail parties. He was scheduled to leave for London early the following week and from there to return to the United States. Listening to the reporters, he, too, was soon infatuated with the idea of getting closer to the Western Front.\n\nJennings said he could borrow an old Peugeot convertible, originally German property but now with \u201cUSA\u201d tags and an American flag sticker on its bumper. The car was a little dilapidated, he confessed, but it would get them there and back.\n\nGertie at her desk in the London branch of the OSS in 1943. The next year, Gertie, who longed to see the front lines of the war, was transferred to Paris.\n\nParis was overcast when Gertie and Jennings set off early on the morning of Sept. 23. \u201cWe rode along straight roads of richly plowed fields that looked the same as in peace time,\u201d Gertie observed. \u201cOnly the occasional remains of a burned out truck or tank gave one the feeling of war.\u201d By noon the rain was pouring through the Peugeot\u2019s rotted canvas top; Gertie tried to patch it, but the water kept pouring down their necks.\n\nLater that afternoon, they blew out a tire, then the Peugeot wheezed and died, forcing Gertie and Jennings to spend the better part of the next two days waiting for the vehicle to be repaired. A local mechanic said the parts could only be obtained in Luxembourg City, so they had the car towed there, where the mechanic said he needed 24 hours to fix it.\n\nTime was running out, and soon they would have to return to Paris. The pair dolefully explored the Allied-controlled city. \u201cConvoys rumbled through the streets incessantly. Soldiers on the march, our countrymen going to battle, were everywhere. Their faces were so young, so full of eagerness and spirit,\u201d Gertie said. This was some of what she had hoped to see, but the following morning at the Hotel Brasseur, over coffee and cigarettes, she and Jennings rued \u201cthe failure of our trip.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, Jennings spotted a U.S. officer entering the dining room \u2014 Jerry Papurt, a major working in X-2, the counterintelligence branch of the OSS. Jennings explained what he and Gertie were doing in Luxembourg. \u201cWe had a little extra time and thought maybe we\u2019d mosey up to the line so the lady could hear some gunfire,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI know where there is some gunfire. Think you could spare the day for a little trip?\u201d Papurt asked.\n\n\u201cWhere is it?\u201d Jennings asked.\n\n\u201cWallendorf,\u201d replied Papurt. \u201cForty kilometers from here, just over the border. \u2026 It\u2019s the first German town we took.\u201d The town had been briefly taken by U.S. forces, but they had just been ordered to withdraw, so they would not get too far ahead of American supply lines. Unbeknownst to Papurt, Wallendorf was back under German control.\n\nPapurt said they could be back in time for lunch and Jennings and Gertie could return to Paris later in the afternoon, after picking up the Peugeot. The trio took off in a jeep driven by Doyle Dickson, a 20-year-old private from Los Angeles who was assigned to the OSS.\n\nA portrait of Gertie by artist William Orpen hung at Medway, her South Carolina plantation.\n\nAs the trip progressed, other traffic disappeared. Jennings, experiencing a frisson of unease, asked Papurt if he was sure they were on the right road. Looked like a good spot for an ambush, he said.\n\nPapurt spoke in German to the next farmer they passed, and he seemed quizzical about the presence of Americans but told them they would be able to see the village when they got around the next bend. He also said the front was close to two miles away.\n\nAll was quiet. As the houses in the village came into focus, there also didn\u2019t seem to be any American presence. \u201cWell, here\u2019s Wallendorf, according to the sign,\u201d said Gertie. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see any \u2026\u201d\n\nThe whistling crack of a single shot cut her short. A bullet had hit the front fender. Gertie experienced a long moment of disbelief before she heard Papurt shout, \u201cSniper! He\u2019s mine.\u201d The major grabbed a rifle and ran behind a roadside hedge. As he crawled on the ground, he lined up his sight on a distant copse of trees from where the shot seemed to have come. There was no second shot, and after several minutes Papurt stood up and shrugged his shoulders. \u201cIf there\u2019s anybody up there, I can\u2019t see them,\u201d he said.\n\nAgainst all common sense and training, they decided to push on. Dickson hadn\u2019t even gotten the car into second gear when a burst of machine-gun fire raked the ground in front of the jeep. All four jumped out; Gertie, Dickson and Jennings lay in a \u201ccowering bundle\u201d on the side of the jeep by a shallow ditch that provided some shelter from the attackers, while Papurt was on the exposed side of the vehicle. The Germans were firing a portable machine gun that could unleash over a thousand rounds a minute.\n\nPapurt, in a quiet, unemotional voice, whispered, \u201cThey got me through the legs.\u201d As Gertie tried to look around the tire to see him, bullets whipped by her. Papurt called out, \u201cTurn the jeep around. It\u2019s our only chance.\u201d Dickson jumped into the driver\u2019s seat, but the vehicle wouldn\u2019t start. \u201cIt\u2019s kaput, sir,\u201d he shouted.\n\nGertrude Legendre felt that she \u201cwasn\u2019t going to be like most of the girls I knew. I wanted something different, something more than the social whirl.\u201d\n\nA fresh round of fire erupted, and Dickson was hit as he tried to scramble from the vehicle. Jennings raced around and pulled the young driver back to the sheltered side. The private had been shot in the legs and shinbone, and his right hand had been shredded, leaving three of his fingers barely attached. Jennings urged Papurt to try to drag himself a little closer to the vehicle, then rushed out from behind the car and dragged Papurt back. Dickson\u2019s wounds were bleeding freely, and he seemed \u201cghastly\u201d to Gertie. She thought his lips looked faintly blue and his face was ashen, but he managed a weak smile as Papurt was placed close to his side. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, son,\u201d Papurt said, assuring the young private that he\u2019d get home to tell his war story.\n\nThere was, however, no obvious escape route. Gertie was too stunned to be frightened but did, in that moment, experience stomach-churning sensations of regret and guilt: that she wouldn\u2019t see her husband again; that the OSS would be compromised; that she had been so damn stupid to get herself \u2014 someone, she thought, who should have remained an office drudge \u2014 into this jam.\n\nPinned down, the group decided to surrender. Jennings pulled a white handkerchief from his pocket and raised it on the barrel of Papurt\u2019s carbine. The firing eased, then stopped.\n\nWaiting for German soldiers to arrive, the four OSS members lined up their stories. Gertie would claim to be a file clerk and an interpreter for Jennings; Jennings would be a Naval observer on a mission to the front; Papurt suggested he\u2019d be an ordnance officer; Dickson, a GI. As to why they were in Wallendorf, the best explanation was the truth: They thought it was under American control and took a ride to see a small piece of Germany.\n\nGertie and the others were about to fall into the hands of the enemy. Gertie had no way of knowing that she would prove to be of deep interest to the SS, which ran a separate detention system for \u201cspecial prisoners\u201d who might be exploited to the benefit of the Reich; that she would spend the next six months being shuttled between interrogation centers, Nazi villas, hotels and private homes; that her capture would become a headache for officials back in Washington, who feared that she would be broken and disclose ongoing operations; that, though Jennings would survive the war, Papurt and Dickson would both be killed in the coming months when Allied bombs hit the hospitals where they were being held.\n\nNor could she know that she would witness the collapse of Hitler\u2019s Reich as no other American did, or that she would escape back to her life in the United States \u2014 where she would live outside Charleston and die at the age of 97 \u2014 only by scrambling to freedom along train tracks by the Swiss border during the waning days of the war. All that would come later \u2014 long after the German soldiers emerged from the trees, approaching Gertie and her companions from two directions, guns leveled. \u201cHands up,\u201d said one in English. The four were now prisoners of war, and Gertrude Legendre had just become the first American woman in uniform captured by the Nazis.\n\nPeter Finn is The Washington Post\u2019s national security editor.
