He's going to be one hell of a goalie for a long, long time. Obviously to learn from Pricey, I'm sure he's licking his chops to watch him. He had a great night tonight.\"\n\nPrimeau spent the last two seasons at Northeastern University (NCAA) where he put up impressive numbers. The New Jersey native is primed to become the top goaltender for the AHL's Laval Rocket this season.\n\nThe Canadiens prospect did his best Price impression on Monday night.\n\nWATCH | Canadiens top Devils in pre-season matchup:\n\nJake Evans scored the game-winning goal and Cayden Primeau made highlight reel saves in Montreal's 4-2 pre-season win over New Jersey. 1:15\n\nBesides a goal on an unlucky bounce, Primeau was solid in net for Montreal. His biggest save was on Blake Coleman with the glove on a 2-on-1 in the second period.\n\n\"I knew I had to respect the shooter, especially at this level,\" said Primeau. \"It looked like he was going to pass it all the way. So I got ready, kind of just blacked out and pushed over as hard as I could.\"\n\nFans at the Bell Centre chanted his name in appreciation.\n\n\"I couldn't help it but crack a smile,\" said Primeau of the fan reaction. \"There were so many emotions. It was unbelievable. This was my first time experiencing something like this. First pre-season game was something special.\"\n\nWith the score tied 2-2 in the third, Primeau shut the door on Kyle Palmieri who came crashing hard to the net with the Devils on a power play.\n\n\"He brought life back into the crowd,\" said coach Claude Julien. \"He had a great game. He handled himself well.\"\n\nTop-shelf winner\n\nJake Evans scored the short-handed winner with 2:28 remaining in the game when he stole the puck from a Devils player at his own blue-line and beat Evan Cormier top shelf on a breakaway. Cormier made 11 saves in relief in the third.\n\nNick Cousins sealed it with an empty-net goal in the final minute of play.\n\nA handful of regular NHL players suited up for both teams, which is not always the case in early exhibition matches.\n\nDomi, Shea Weber and Jonathan Drouin dressed for the Canadiens. Top prospect Ryan Poehling did not play.\n\nNico Hischier and Palmieri were on the ice for the split-squad Devils while P.K. Subban and Jack Hughes remained in New Jersey to face the Boston Bruins in another exhibition game at Prudential Center.\n\nThe Canadiens scored twice on four shots in the game's opening eight minutes.\n\nWill Butcher cut the deficit for the Devils at 18:25 of the first with a precise top-corner shot on Price's stick side. Price conceded one goal on nine shots\n\n\"We want to have a good pre-season and a good winning record,\" said Drouin, who had an assist. \"Usually you feel good coming into the season when you have some good wins in pre-season. It's nice to see the young guys come in and have fun and work hard.\"", "description": "Jake Evans scored late in the third period to lead the Montreal Canadiens to a 4-2 victory over the New Jersey Devils on Monday night in the first NHL pre-season game for both teams.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5286225.1568684921!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/devils-canadiens.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
