As Delecto, Romney, who has become one of President Trump\u2019s most vocal GOP critics, used the account to like critical tweets about the president, while also occasionally defending himself against detractors. By early Monday, the unusual pseudonym was a trending moment on Twitter and had been mentioned in more than 47,000 tweets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI think people on both sides of the aisle can admit that Pierre Delecto is an amazing fake twitter name. \u2014 Spike Eskin (@SpikeEskin) October 20, 2019\n\nThe Romney-Delecto connection was first made by Slate\u2019s Ashley Feinberg, who went hunting for the secret account after the senator mentioned its existence to the Atlantic in a profile published Sunday. In a follow-up call with Atlantic reporter McKay Coppins, Romney confirmed that the account, which has since been made private, is his.\n\n\u201cC\u2019est moi,\u201d Romney said after being asked about Delecto.\n\nWhen reached for comment late Sunday, a spokesperson for Romney responded by emailing The Washington Post a link to a tweet from Coppins that contained Romney\u2019s brief confirmation.\n\nJust spoke to @MittRomney on the phone, and asked him about Pierre Delecto. His only response: \"C'est moi.\" Updated my story accordingly: https://t.co/kcfIopokWh \u2014 McKay Coppins (@mckaycoppins) October 21, 2019\n\nRomney brought up his covert Twitter persona during an interview with the Atlantic as he discussed Trump lashing out at him on social media. The 72-year-old senator has condemned Trump for allegedly attempting to get officials in Ukraine to dig up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden and slammed the president\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria. In response, Trump has labeled Romney a \u201cpompous \u2018ass\u2019\u201d and called for his \u201cimpeachment,\u201d though senators cannot be impeached.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Coppins, Romney shrugged off Trump\u2019s insults and grabbed an iPad off his desk during the interview.\n\n\u201cHe explained that he uses a secret Twitter account \u2014 \u2018What do they call me, a lurker?\u2019 \u2014 to keep tabs on the political conversation,\u201d Coppins wrote.\n\nThe senator declined to name the account, noting only that he was \u201cfollowing 668 people,\u201d listing journalists, late-night comedians and athletes, Coppins reported.\n\nBut those slim details were more than enough for Feinberg, who previously discovered that former FBI director James B. Comey was on Twitter using the alias \u201cReinhold Niebuhr.\"\n\nThe process, Feinberg wrote, hinged on the assumption that \u201cRomney, a known family man, would want to keep close tabs on his offspring.\u201d Instead of targeting his family members with tens of thousands of followers, Feinberg homed in on a public account belonging to Allie Romney Critchlow, the senator\u2019s oldest grandchild. Critchlow\u2019s account \u201chas just 481 followers, making digging through them an annoying-but-not-impossible feat,\u201d Feinberg wrote.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThen, as Feinberg looked through Critchlow\u2019s followers for users who \u201cappeared to make an effort to conceal their real identities,\u201d one caught her attention: Pierre Delecto.\n\nA deeper dive into Delecto\u2019s account found that it matched the description Romney gave to the Atlantic. The account was created in July 2011, shortly after Romney announced he was going to run for president, Slate reported. Beyond politicians, political reporters and pundits, Delecto follows late-night hosts Conan O\u2019Brien, Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon and athletes such as New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre, according to Slate.\n\nThe clues pointing to Romney continued to add up, Feinberg wrote. The first user Delecto followed was Tagg Romney, the senator\u2019s eldest son. The account later followed a number of people associated with Romney, such as advisers, aides and reporters who have covered him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnother clue was Delecto\u2019s Twitter activity. In the past eight years, Delecto has liked 257 tweets and only tweeted 10 times, all of which were replies to other Twitter users. According to Slate, Delecto liked nearly 70 tweets that either came directly from Romney\u2019s official accounts or were posts quoting from those accounts.\n\nScreen shots from the account show Delecto liking tweets that praised Romney\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s Syria decision. Delecto also liked tweets denouncing Trump, including one that read, \u201cIf this is a stable genius, I would hate to see what an unstable idiot would do,\u201d and another criticizing the president for playing golf amid the Syria crisis.\n\nBut perhaps even more telling were Delecto\u2019s sparse tweets, several of which defended Romney.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOnly Republican to hit Trump on [Mueller] report, only one to hit Trump on character time and again, so Soledad, you think he\u2019s the one without moral compass?\u201d Delecto wrote earlier this year in response to a critical tweet from journalist Soledad O\u2019Brien, who had called out the senator for his \u201cutter lack of a moral compass.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe account\u2019s most recent tweet, dated Saturday, appeared to be a tongue-in-cheek response to conservative radio host and blogger Erick Erickson applauding Romney for taking a public stand against Trump.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t read the comments, ever,\u201d Delecto wrote.\n\nSocial media users quickly became obsessed with the bizarre moniker the senator chose for his alter ego.\n\nAD\n\nAs some praised Romney for the name, describing it as \u201cexquisite\u201d and \u201cobjectively terrific,\u201d others were reminded of equally distinctive pseudonyms used by public figures in the past.\n\nFormer New York congressman Anthony Weiner used the alias \u201cCarlos Danger\u201d to send explicit photos to at least one woman. Former pro football player Michael Vick allegedly referred to himself as \u201cRon Mexico\u201d in an attempt to hide his identity while receiving treatment for herpes. Even Trump has used a fake name, going by \u201cJohn Barron\u201d when he pretended to be his own spokesman in the 1980s.\n\nAD\n\nStop me if you've heard this one: Pierre Delecto, Carlos Danger, and John Barron walk into a bar... \u2014 Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) October 21, 2019\n\nElevator pitch: A heist film where the crooks don the names Pierre Delecto, Carlos Danger, John Baron, Reinhold Niebuhr. \u2014 Jeet Heer (@HeerJeet) October 20, 2019\n\nSome pointed out that this also isn\u2019t the first time Romney has adopted a false identity. In 2012, the Stanford Daily reported that when Romney was a freshman at the university, he used the name \u201cTim Yenmor,\u201d or Mitt (minus a T) Romney backward, in an effort to foil a rival school\u2019s planned prank.\n\nAD\n\nSure, \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d is a fabulous alias. But still doesn\u2019t beat when @MittRomney infiltrated the Cal Rally Committee as \u201cTim Yenmor\u201d and stole the Axe as a Stanford freshman. https://t.co/b0g0uG6bFK \u2014 Jim Prosser \ud83d\udd96 (@jimprosser) October 21, 2019\n\nIt remains unclear exactly how Romney decided on \u201cPierre Delecto,\u201d but that didn\u2019t stop eager Twitter sleuths from trying to figure it out.\n\n*feverishly running \"Pierre Delecto\" through an online anagram solver* \u2014 Ben Collins (@oneunderscore__) October 20, 2019\n\nPeople suggested that \u201cPierre\u201d might come from Romney\u2019s time spent as a missionary in France and that \u201cDelecto\u201d could be a reference to the Latin phrase \u201cin flagrante delicto,\u201d which translates to \u201cwhile the crime is blazing,\u201d according to Merriam-Webster.\n\nBut amid theories about the name\u2019s origin, jokes abounded.\n\nGuys I found Pierre Delecto pic.twitter.com/1ipNyEBXhl \u2014 #Delecto2020 (@ThatElJefe) October 20, 2019\n\nBe on zee lookout for Pierre Delecto! pic.twitter.com/0aDSMtnn4h \u2014 Poso Delecto \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@JackPosobiec) October 21, 2019\n\nBrent Griffiths contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "As Pierre Delecto, Romney used the account to like critical tweets about the president while also occasionally defending himself against detractors.", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wv02t-xhzdOGJYbgrYlUEEqk9w8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OFXH45TRYQI6TEZRGC6FQNXURY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
