There were 15 minutes to go in the trading day on a Friday... after the Dow had risen 700 points in the last two days,\" he said.\n\nTop-level discussions between the two countries concluded their second day on Friday.\n\nCyclicals were among the day's best-performing groups, with the S&P industrial index up about 2% ahead of the third-quarter earnings season, which is set to begin next week.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 319.92 points, or 1.21%, to 26,816.59, the S&P 500 gained 32.14 points, or 1.09%, to 2,970.27 and the Nasdaq Composite added 106.27 points, or 1.34%, to 8,057.04.\n\nIndexes also gained for the week, with the Dow and Nasdaq each up 0.9% and the S&P 500 up 0.6%.\n\nAnalysts expect S&P 500 earnings to have declined 3.2% year-on-year in the third quarter, which would mark the first decline since 2016, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nBets for another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve fell after data showed a rise in consumer sentiment for the month of October.\n\nApple's stock rose as Wedbush raised its price target, citing confidence in the company's new video streaming service.\n\nThe industrial index was boosted by a surge in shares of Fastenal Co after the industrial distributor beat quarterly profit expectations.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.14-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.08-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 44 new highs and 60 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 7.55 billion shares, compared to the roughly 7 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
