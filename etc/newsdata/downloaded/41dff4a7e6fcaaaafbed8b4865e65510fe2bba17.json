And I refused to leave the hospital until they operated,' she said.\n\n'It was poor medical practice and women are being sent home to go into labour at 12 weeks.'\n\nDaily Mail Australia has reached out to the Southern NSW Local Health District for comment.", "description": "Gemma Carey was admitted to Moruya District Hospital on the NSW far south coast, where she was forced to give birth without pain relief last weekend.", "authors": ["Lauren Ferri For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/01/19942126-0-image-a-15_1571531068858.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
