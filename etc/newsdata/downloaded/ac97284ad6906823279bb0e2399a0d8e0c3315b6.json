The vehicle that struck and killed the pedestrian had identified the need to apply the brakes, the report said.\n\nThe preliminary report disclosed the vehicle's radar systems observed the pedestrian six seconds before impact but \"the self-driving system software classified the pedestrian as an unknown object, as a vehicle, and then as a bicycle with varying expectations of future travel path.\"", "description": "NTSB to determine probable cause of fatal Uber self-driving crash", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9G1TK-OCATC_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
