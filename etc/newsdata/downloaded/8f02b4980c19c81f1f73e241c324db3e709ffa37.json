Getty\n\nBut Labour, Liberal Democrats and other opposition parties are thought to have agreed to withhold their support for a poll until after the PM has requested an extension to the UK\u2019s Brexit deadline to 31 January.\n\nA Downing Street spokeswoman was asked at a regular Westminster media briefing whether Mr Johnson\u2019s comments indicated he would resign rather than request an Article 50 extension.\n\nShe replied: \u201cI think that the PM has made his position on extension clear a number of times this week. In relation to MPs and the decisions that they are facing, the PM has said that the current position is unsustainable and that MPs should consider over the weekend whether they are prepared to face up to the consequences of their actions this week in passing a bill that wrecks our negotiations and seeks to impose an indefinite delay to Brexit.\n\n\u201cHe has been very clear that they must take responsibility for their actions and face the public in a general election, and MPs will have a chance to do that on Monday.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The situation you are putting to me is a situation which hasn\u2019t occurred.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson dodged the question of resignation during a visit to a police training academy in Yorkshire on Thursday.\n\nIn response to a question on whether he could promise not to ask for an extension to Brexit negotiations, the prime minister replied: \u201cYes, I can. I would rather be dead in a ditch.\u201d\n\nBut challenged on whether he would therefore resign if the bill becomes law on Monday, he simply repeated his objection to an extension: \u201cIt costs \u00a31 billion a month, it achieves nothing. What on Earth is the point of further delay? I think it\u2019s totally, totally pointless.\u201d\n\nA Number 10 source insisted earlier this week that the PM would not stand down if parliament required him to extend Brexit negotiations.\n\n\u201cHe is not going to stand down,\u201d the source told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cWe will find a way to deliver on what the British people want, which is to deliver Brexit on 31 October.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear how Mr Johnson could avoid asking for an extension if Hilary Benn\u2019s bill becomes law, other than by striking a deal with Brussels, resigning or breaking the law.\n\nAsked in the House of Commons on Tuesday whether the government would abide by the rule of law if the bill makes no-deal illegal, Mr Johnson told MPs: \u201cWe will of course uphold the constitution and obey the law.\u201d\n\nThe cabinet\u2019s no-deal supremo Michael Gove told a Commons committee on Thursday that the government would obey the law, but could not explain how this could be reconciled with the PM\u2019s refusal to ask for an extension.", "description": "Downing Street has declined to rule out the possibility of Boris Johnson resigning as prime minister if he fails to secure a general election or a Brexit deal.
