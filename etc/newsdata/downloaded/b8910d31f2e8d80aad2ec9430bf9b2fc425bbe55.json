Saudi Arabia took media to inspect oil facilities hit by attacks that Washington and Riyadh blame on Iran, showing melted pipes and burnt equipment, as Tehran vowed wide retaliation if heightened tensions boil over into hostilities.

The next day, I asked the head of the foreign intelligence service and the defence minister. \u2018No, we don\u2019t know.\u2019\u201d he said according to an Arabic-language transcript provided by Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television.\n\nThe Russian president is due to arrive in Saudi Arabia on Monday and then heads to the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday.\n\nTensions in the Gulf region have risen to new highs since May 2018, when the Trump administration withdrew from a 2015 international nuclear accord with Tehran that put limits on its nuclear programme in exchange for the easing of sanctions.\n\nAs Trump reinstated U.S. sanctions, increasing pressure on Iran\u2019s economy, there have been a series of attacks in Saudi Arabia and in Gulf waters that Washington and close allies have blamed on Iran, which denies responsibility.\n\nPutin said such attacks only strengthened cooperation between oil producers inside and outside OPEC, an alliance known as OPEC+, and that Russia would work with its partners to reduce attempts to destabilise markets.\n\nHe said he had \u201cvery friendly personal relations\u201d with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto Saudi ruler who has won praise for plans to wean the economy off oil and open up society but faced an international outcry over a devastating war in Yemen and human rights abuses, including last year\u2019s murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nIRAN DEAL, SYRIA\n\nAsked if Moscow supported new a return to negotiations with Iran to limit its missile programme as Trump has called for or enforcing the nuclear deal first, Putin said the two issues should be dealt with separately.\n\n\u201cMost likely it (the missiles) can and should be discussed ... The missile programme is one thing and the nuclear programme is another thing,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, this is necessary, but there is no need to merge one with the other...\u201d\n\nOn Syria, where Russia and Iran have been key allies of President Bashar al-Assad in an 8-1/2-year civil war, Putin said any new constitution that is drawn up should guarantee the rights of all ethnic and religions groups.\n\nA congress convened by Russia last year tasked the United Nations envoy for Syria with forming a committee to draft a new constitution, after many rounds of talks to end the war failed.\n\nU.N. officials say forming a constitutional committee is key to political reforms and new elections meant to unify Syria and end a war which has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced about half of the pre-war 22 million population.\n\nPutin said Syrians \u201cinteract positively\u201d with Russian military police and military stationed in the country and that most military police in Syria were Muslims drawn from Russia\u2019s north Caucasus region.\n\nTurkey launched an assault last week against Kurdish forces in border areas of northern Syria, saying it seeks to set up a \u201csafe zone\u201d to resettle Syrian refugees but raising international alarm over the possibility of Islamic State militants escaping from prisons.", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin said before his first visit to Saudi Arabia in more than a decade that Moscow could play a key role in easing regional tensions given its good ties with Sunni Muslim Gulf Arab states and Shi'ite Iran.", "authors": ["Olesya Astakhova", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440376011&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0FE", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
