And he should pay the price | Rafael Behr", "language": "en", "text": "If Boris Johnson does nothing more, his name in history is already inscribed as the man who lied so hard he nearly broke the constitution. He certainly broke the law, as definitively interpreted by the supreme court today. Any leader with respect for the responsibilities that come with high office, and capable of shame, would immediately resign. Nothing in Johnson\u2019s record suggests he is such a person. He clambered to Downing Street over the wreckage of his own former beliefs, ruined friendships and betrayed relationships. He has never recognised the imperative of truth, so takes no instruction from it now.\n\nThe new pinnacle of Johnson\u2019s career as a peddler of falsehood is his claim that parliament\u2019s suspension earlier this month was procedural \u2013 a conventional legislative reboot ahead of a Queen\u2019s speech to set out a new domestic agenda. No one believed him. His own ministers struggled to hold the line, blurting out the true motive, which was to limit MPs\u2019 control over Brexit. By unanimous verdict, the country\u2019s most senior judges ruled that prorogation did indeed have the effect of \u201cpreventing or frustrating\u201d the legislature in pursuit of its constitutional duties \u2013 passing laws, holding ministers to account and, crucially, representing the public in Commons debates. The court noted that those functions were uniquely urgent, given the proximity of the Brexit deadline. The stymying deed had to be undone.\n\nThe supreme court judgment is a devastating blow for a failed prime minister | Martin Kettle Read more\n\nThe judges did not dwell on Johnson\u2019s motives, noting only that the government did not give a reason \u2013 \u201clet alone a good reason\u201d \u2013 to justify \u201cprolonged suspension\u201d of the democratic process. In short, he abused his power. He raided the fancy-dress box of usually benign ceremonial features of parliamentary business, plucked out a potentially awesome ancient weapon \u2013 the ability to dismiss the legislature when it is being a nuisance \u2013 and wielded it as if he were himself the monarch. He snatched the crown from the Queen\u2019s head and used it to try to bludgeon opponents into a Brexit they did not endorse.\n\nOpinions on the wisdom of the court\u2019s judgment have inevitably sorted themselves into trenches on the familiar partisan battlefield. Hardline Brexiteers see it as a land grab by an activist judiciary, impinging on terrain that should be contested by politics alone. That is then woven into the alleged conspiracy by a pro-EU ancien regime to thwart the Eurosceptic revolution. A dilute version of that view, outrage-lite, warns that the supreme court has mutated into something more like its US counterpart, with party politics likely to hijack future appointments.\n\nThat concern is not groundless, although it is tangential to the validity of the court\u2019s verdict. Fear of future politicisation would be an argument for not bringing the case at all. But since it was brought \u2013 and if we presume the judges acted professionally \u2013 there should be no doubt that the exposure of an unlawful prorogation is a good thing. The alternative is wishing the prime minister could break the law.\n\nThat is the murky ground where Johnson\u2019s supporters now stand. They know he is a liar. They also know that there is no purpose for his leadership of their party higher than the satisfaction of vanity. They have two reasons to stick with him. One is practical: their personal ambitions are folded into his. If he falls, they fall. The second is ideological: Johnson has mortgaged his career to hardliners who demand total rupture from the EU. He won the Conservative leadership with their support, using rhetoric pitched at an electorate groomed for European bridge-burning by Nigel Farage. For that faction, today\u2019s court ruling hardly feels like a setback. On the contrary, it develops the myth of Johnson as a tribune of the masses, heading a national liberation struggle and opposed by Europhiliac elites in cahoots with the bureaucratic colonists of Brussels.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s decision to go native in the wilder corners of Brexitland limits his capacity to negotiate a new withdrawal agreement, if that is indeed what he wants. Even if he manages it, a reconvened parliament, feeling its sovereignty burnished anew, is unlikely to be indulgent with ratification. So Johnson needs an election where he runs as Eurosceptic Santa unable to deliver freedom to all the boys and girls because filthy remainers are blocking the chimney. Clear them out, he will say, and the goodies flow. Johnson\u2019s reaction to the court ruling, locating the problem among \u201cpeople who want to frustrate Brexit\u201d, is a rehearsal for that campaign.\n\nIt is hard to know whether Johnson\u2019s mishaps and defeats since taking office help or hinder that message. He is discredited in the eyes of people who had a low opinion of him already. They are not his target market. The audience he wants to reach is unfussed by constitutional niceties, and more likely to be impressed than appalled by a leader\u2019s readiness to go a bit rogue to get a job done. Then again, the strongman shtick needs shows of strength to be credible. Johnson only has conspicuous weakness on his record.\n\nThe supreme court judgment may have electoral consequences, but those should not be the measure of its significance. At the core of the case is a dispute over the character of British democracy and the origins of a prime minister\u2019s legitimacy. The Johnson proposition, never fully articulated but expressed in various ways by his supporters, is that the 2016 referendum result generated a single insuperable mandate \u2013 a \u201cwill of the people\u201d \u2013 such that no institutional check or subsequent statute could qualify or restrain. He then offers himself as the incarnation of that idea, the super-mandate made flesh.\n\nThat is convenient, since the technical mandate that keeps him in Downing Street is flimsy as hell. He was chosen as Tory leader by 92,153 party members. He was automatically upgraded to the job of prime minister because Theresa May could just about scrape together a majority in the Commons. Johnson took that threadbare, hand-me-down legitimacy and shredded it. He lost control of parliament and so he tried to shut it down, using a royal prerogative power. His Brexiteer cheerleaders pray democracy in aid of their cause, but in confrontation with a sovereign parliament they reached for the tools of premodern monarchical caprice.\n\nThe hyperactive nature of Britain\u2019s current political crisis makes it hard to keep up with the sequence of momentous events, let alone arrange them in order of magnitude. A relentless barrage of news is desensitising; numbness can be a symptom of shock. But when the highest court in the land rules unanimously that the prime minister tried to obstruct the basic functions of democracy, the frenzy has to stop for a moment.\n\nPolitics needs to catch its breath. Johnson holds his office by crown appointment on the basis that he governs with the consent of parliament, representing the people. There is no higher channel that somehow transmutes the popular will into the body of a supreme leader. That mystical power is claimed only by charlatans and autocrats. A healthy democracy might sometimes elevate such people to its highest offices. The vital test is how swiftly it expels them once their true character has been exposed.\n\n\u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist", "description": "The supreme court could not have been clearer: Johnson\u2019s prorogation of parliament was a subversion of democracy, says Guardian columnist Rafael Behr", "authors": ["Rafael Behr"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b30aa84642575304c0145117e08c2a4e652a37db/0_350_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=cc61834e4906cad7db8334d76fb173f9", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
