He's leaning toward Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts because, even though she's 70, \"she's the most liberal and she's not got one foot in the grave yet.\"\n\n\"Bernie's just too darn old. And so is Biden,\" Lundberg said. \"They look old, they sound old, they are old. They fall in the shower, and they get heart attacks!\"\n\nLundberg is not alone.\n\nPolling has suggested that a significant number of Americans believe a candidate in his or her late 70s is too old to be president. If elected, Sanders would take office having already exceeded the average U.S. life expectancy of 78.6 years, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. Biden would be just a few months away.\n\nWhile Biden, the former vice president, has often laughed off questions about his age, the issue is one that Sanders has been forced to confront more directly as he returned to Iowa this week. Sanders, a senator from Vermont, is traveling with his wife and campaign manager, whose responsibilities include ensuring that he take modest precautions not to over-exert himself, takes daily walks of at least half an hour with no phone calls and sticks to a healthier diet.\n\n\"He wants to run,\" said campaign manager Faiz Shakir, who said he would likely accompany Sanders on the campaign trail for the next month. \"Our job is to make sure he knows he's in a marathon, not a sprint.\"\n\nSanders opened up about his health during an interview at a coffee shop in Des Moines, one of several he conducted this week as he works to convince voters in the first states on the 2020 presidential primary calendar that he's physically able to beat President Donald Trump next fall and assume the demands of the presidency.\n\nSanders would be 79 years old when inaugurated. Biden would be 78 if he wins. To date, Trump is the oldest candidate to win a first term: He was 70 when sworn into office.\n\nSanders told The Associated Press he was looking forward to \"a 100 percent recovery \u2014 full recovery.\"\n\n\"Now I got three good arteries,\" he said. \"And three good arteries are better than two good arteries. So, I'm feeling pretty good.\"\n\nAt a subsequent campaign appearance in Marshalltown, he confronted the age question directly without being asked.\n\n\"I've been criticized for being old. I plead guilty. I am old,\" Sanders said, sparking laughter and applause in the audience.\n\nHe then insisted that his advanced age offered some advantages.\n\n\"When you have been involved in public life for many, many decades, you and the people of this country have had an opportunity to look at my record. And what you will find is that the ideas I am talking to you about tonight, they didn't come to me yesterday,\" Sanders charged. \"These are ideas that I have fought for my entire life.\"\n\nMany in the audience applauded the message. But afterward, not everyone was cheering.\n\nRetired Marshalltown resident Ed Canade, 72, described himself as \"somewhat concerned\" about Sanders' age.\n\n\"I know as I age, everything isn't quite as sharp. That's the reality of age. I can feel it in my own body,\" Canade said. \"I think Bernie's doing well for his age.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Biden called his age \"a legitimate question\" in an interview days after entering the presidential race in April and said it's up to voters to \"watch me\" and decide for themselves.\n\nSince then, Biden has not been forced to confront the age question as often as Sanders, despite frequent gaffes on the campaign trail. The former vice president has frequently appeared to mix up dates, offer outdated pop culture references and forget his words.\n\nHe promised earlier in the month to release his health records to help demonstrate his physical readiness for the nation's top job.", "description": "Bernie Sanders insists he feels better than ever less than a month after heart surgery, but his return to the campaign trail this week sparked new questions about the unusually old age of the Democratic Party's leading 2020 presidential candidates.
