The 15 strikeouts tied for third-most in a post-season game, the highest total since Roger Clemens had 15 in the 2000 AL Championship Series for the New York Yankees against Seattle.\n\nYuli Gurriel slides into home after a single by Martin Maldonado in the seventh inning. (Tim Warner/Getty Images)\n\nCole (1-0), who led the majors with 326 strikeouts in the regular season, extended his major league record with his 10th straight game with at least 10 Ks. The Rays were unable to string anything together off of him on a night he induced 33 swings and misses \u2014 the most since MLB started tracking the stat in 2008 \u2014 and threw a career-high 118 pitches.\n\nKevin Kiemaier doubled with two outs in the eighth and Cole was lifted after putting on Willy Adames with Cole's first walk. The right-hander received a standing ovation as he walked off the mound and waved to the crowd just before he reached the dugout. Roberto Osuna took over and struck out Yandy Diaz to end the inning before running into trouble in the ninth.\n\nWATCH | Gerrit Cole fans 15 batters as Astros take 2-0 series lead over Rays:\n\nGerrit Cole struck out 15 batters over 7 & 2/3 scoreless innings to vault the Astros to a 3-1 win over the Rays. 2:05\n\nAustin Meadows and Tommy Pham hit consecutive singles and Ji-Man Choi walked to load the bases. The Rays cut the lead to 3-1 when Avisail Garcia grounded into a forceout that scored Meadows. Osuna walked Brandon Lowe, reloading the bases, and Astros manager AJ Hinch brought in Will Harris.\n\nTravis d'Arnaud worked the count full, then struck out on a high cutter, and Kiermaier grounded to first baseman Yuli Gurriel, who flipped to Harris, who stepped on first for the save.\n\nAlex Bregman of the Houston Astros celebrates a solo home run in the fourth inning with teammate Jose Altuve. (Bob Levey/Getty Images)\n\nCole's performance came after fellow ace and Cy Young Award contender Justin Verlander pitched seven scoreless innings to lead the Astros to a 6-2 win in the opener on Friday.\n\nGame 3 of the best-of five series is Monday in Florida.\n\nThere were no outs in the fourth when Bregman, who hit a career-best 41 home runs in the regular season, homered off Blake Snell (0-10). All seven of Bregman's homers have come off All-Stars, including two against Chris Sale and one each vs. Trevor Bauer, Clayton Kershaw, Corey Kluber and Kenley Jansen.\n\nHis shot gave the Astros a home run in 27 straight games, extending a franchise record.\n\nTampa Bay Rays starting pitcher Blake Snell, centre, is pulled from the game after giving up a solo home run to Houston Astros' Alex Bregman during the fourth inning. (Eric Christian Smith/Associated Press)\n\nAfter Lowe's error at second gifted Houston two runs in the opener, another error on helped in the seventh. Adames bobbled Gurriel's leadoff grounder to shortstop, then bounced the thorw to first. Carlos Correa doubled and Martin Maldonado blooped a run-scoring single to left.\n\nCorrea added a two-out RBI single off Nick Anderson in the eighth for a 3-0 lead.\n\nSnell, the 2018 AL Cy Young Award winner, sat out from July 22-Sept. 17 after arthroscopic surgery to remove bone chips in his left elbow. He didn't get out of the third inning in any of his three September starts, but said he hoped to give the Rays five innings on Saturday. Instead he was lifted one batter after Bregman's homer, finishing with four hits and a strikeout in 3 1/3 innings.\n\nCorrea helped Cole out with a fantastic defensive play to start the game. Diaz led off with a grounder toward Correa, who grabbed the ball backhanded while on the run and spun around for the throw to Gurriel that just beat a sliding Diaz.\n\nUp Next\n\nFormer Astro Charlie Morton, who got the win in the Rays wild-card victory, will start against Zack Greinke. Morton pitched for the Astros from 2017-18 and played a big role in their 2017 World Series title. He won Game 7 of AL Championship Series against the Yankees and Game 7 of the World Series at Dodger Stadium to give Houston its first championship.\n\nMorton had a tough time in his last start against Houston when he gave up a season-high six runs in four innings, which tied his shortest start of season, in a 15-1 win by Astros on Aug. 27. Greinke, acquired from Arizona at the trade deadline, went 8-1 with a 3.02 ERA in 10 starts after the trade capped by a gem in his last start when he came two outs shy of his first no-hitter on Sept. 25 against Seattle.", "description": "Gerritt Cole pitches 15 strikeouts, Alex Bregman hits a solo home run, and the Houston Astros beat the Tampa Bay rays 3-1 on Saturday, giving them a 2-0 lead in the AL Division Series.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5310834.1570331305!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/rays-astros-10519.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
