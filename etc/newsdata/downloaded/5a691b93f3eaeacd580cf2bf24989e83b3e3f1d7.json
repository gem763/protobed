His former NBC colleagues called the allegation \"painful.\" USA TODAY\n\nIn an unusual media \"interview,\" even for these times, Matt Lauer sat down with a journalist and made a case defending himself from a rape accusation, but it was all off the record, except for pictures of the encounter.\n\nJohn Ziegler, host of a radio talk show in Los Angeles and senior columnist for Mediaite.com, described his encounter with Lauer, including pictures of the two of them in Lauer's kitchen, on Wednesday on Mediaite, the online political-and-media news site founded by Dan Abrams, ABC News' chief legal affairs commentator.\n\n\"Tuesday I took a red-eye flight from Los Angeles to New York so that I could spend most of the day speaking with former NBC News anchor Matt Lauer about his version of the events that resulted in his 2017 firing, and the news-making allegations of sexual assault against him in Ronan Farrow\u2019s new book,\" Ziegler opens.\n\nBut that's just the tease, followed by the letdown: \"...After hours on the phone negotiating with Lauer, our agreement was that I could characterize the meeting, and we would take a photo documenting it, though the contents of our conversation would not be on the record, at least not right now.\"\n\nMatt Lauer in the Rosa Khutor Mountain Village ahead of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics on Feb. 6, 2014 in Sochi, Russia. (Photo: Scott Halleran/Getty Images)\n\nAlthough Lauer issued a furious statement denying rape allegations, there is more to his side of the story \"which I am not currently at liberty to divulge,\" Ziegler writes.\n\nHe says Lauer had not read Farrow's book, \"Catch and Kill,\" which contains the previously unknown allegation from a former colleague of Lauer who says Lauer raped her in a hotel room at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia. That turns out to be the main reason why Lauer was fired for sexual misconduct by NBC in 2017, although the word \"rape\" wasn't used at the time.\n\n\"I will say that hearing him tell his perspective in detail is extremely persuasive, especially when I get him to react in real time to details in the book, of which he apparently had no previous knowledge,\" Ziegler writes.\n\nZiegler told USA TODAY that Lauer called him 10 days ago wanting to talk, that he spent about six hours with him at his Hamptons home in \"intense\" conversation. Why not on the record?\n\n\"He's trying to thread a needle here where he has a vehicle to getting his story out without giving up on the full-on exclusive of his first post-firing interview that everyone wants \u2013 and he hasn't done since 2017,\" Ziegler said.\n\nSo when does the rest of the world get to hear what Lauer has to say? At the end of his piece, Ziegler says Lauer wants to tell his version of events in public now that he's been publicly accused of a crime that is unlikely to ever be resolved in a criminal court.\n\nRonan Farrow in April 2018 at Variety's Power of Women: New York at Cipriani Wall Street in New York City.

Both NBC and Weinstein deny this.\n\nMatt Lauer in November 2017 on the set of the \"Today\" show in New York.
