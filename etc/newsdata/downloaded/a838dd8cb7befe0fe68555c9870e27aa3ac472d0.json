The Dow Jones opened down 0.5 per cent, with the S&P also falling.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The president said this week that any economic damage inflicted is necessary because \u201csomebody had to take China on\u201d.\n\nBefore China\u2019s latest announcement, analysts at JPMorgan said the trade war is already set to cost the average American household $600 per year, a figure that will rise to $1,000 if Mr Trump goes through with implementing the new tariffs on $300bn of goods.\n\nTalks over a way forward appear to be deadlocked. China insists Mr Trump's punitive tariffs have to be lifted as soon as an agreement takes effect. But Washington says that at least some have to stay to ensure Beijing carries out any promises it makes.\n\nThe US claims Beijing's development plans violate its commitment to open up China's economy and are based on pressuring foreign companies to hand over technology secrets or stealing from them.", "description": "China has raised tariffs on around $75bn of US imports in retaliation for Donald Trump\u2019s latest tariff increases, further escalating trade tensions that risk tipping the world economy into recession.
