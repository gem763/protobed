Look, it\u2019s not been without our desire to, because our fans have wanted it so much.\u2019\n\nAsked whether all six of the Friends would have taken part, Jennifer continued: \u2018It depends.\n\n\u2018I mean, we haven\u2019t all sat in a room. But would we have loved to have done something together? Yeah. It would have been fun. We could have redesigned it for a couple episodes.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe continued to Variety: \u2018But whatever. Maybe it\u2019s better this way, but we\u2019ll never know.\u2019\n\nJennifer said it would have been fun to redesign the show (Picture: Getty)\n\nJennifer\u2019s comments come just months after Adam Sandler publicly called on her to make a \u2018f***ing Friends movie\u2018.\n\n\u2018Friends was a powerhouse,\u2019 added Adam, speaking to People. \u2018Everybody on Friends is excellent, everybody likes them. America, the world loves the cast.\u2019\n\nHowever, like Jennifer explained, co-creator and executive producer Marta Kauffman has ruled out any chance of a reunion or reboot entirely.\n\n\u2018We will not be doing a reunion show, we will not be doing a reboot,\u2019 she said. \u2018The show was about that time in life when friends are your family.\u2019\n\nOn the subject of a reboot, Kauffman added: \u2018It\u2019s not going to beat what we did.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, co-creator and executive producer David Crane agreed, adding to Deadline: \u2018We did the show we wanted to do. We got it right, and we put a bow on it.\u2019\n\nFriends is available to stream on Netflix in the UK.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
