Subscribe\n\nHas anything really changed since July 31?\n\nThe Fed\u2019s latest two-day policy meeting gets underway today, and it is expected to result in another rate cut tomorrow afternoon. Now, since the Fed cut rates on July 31, obviously a lot has happened in the market.\n\nBut looking at where markets stand, it might also seem like not much has changed.\n\nAt the Fed\u2019s last meeting it voted to lower interest rates by 25 basis points, the central bank\u2019s first cut since 2008. Following this anticipated rate cut, Trump announced new tariffs on Chinese imports. This announcement sent markets into a tailspin. Calls for the Fed to act more aggressively began, from the White House and elsewhere. The S&P 500 dropped as much as 8% during the month of August. The Treasury yield curve worryingly inverted for the first time in over a decade.\n\nThe signal financial markets sent was that recession risks were rising. Quickly.\n\nAnd then it all just sort of went away.\n\nOn July 29, the day before the Fed\u2019s last interest rate announcement, the Dow closed at 27,198; on Monday, it closed at 27,076. That same day, the S&P 500 closed at 3,020; on Monday, it closed at 2,997.\n\nEven the price of crude oil \u2014 after this weekend\u2019s news that Saudi Arabian oil facilities were attacked and 5% of the world\u2019s oil supply was taken offline \u2014 isn\u2019t all that far from where it stood ahead of the Fed\u2019s last meeting. Following Monday\u2019s 15% rally, WTI crude settled at $61.88 per barrel; on the day of the Fed\u2019s rate cut it settled at $58.58.\n\nBecause whether it was the August jobs report, or the August retail sales report, or August inflation data, or something else that did it, at some point in the past three weeks investors became convinced that there would not, in fact, be a recession in the U.S.\n\nAnd everything has been unwinding since. As we noted last week in this space, the stock market has seen massive rotations out of growth and momentum trades that had worked during this downturn and into value stocks that had been beaten down. This kind of mismatched positioning in the market is why Bank of America's latest Bull & Bear reading is still at \"extreme bearishness\" \u2014 everyone has been bracing for the end of the world. (Which apparently involved buying McDonald's and Chipotle every day.)\n\nOver the last few weeks, investors have instead been snapping up shares of banks, small caps, industrials, homebuilders, and chip stocks. The kind of stuff that leads during an environment when investors anticipate more growth and less recession.\n\nEconomists will still emphasize that recession risks remain elevated, that growth will likely slow next year, that the trade war will hurt consumers more in the months ahead. And rising tensions in the Middle East are exactly the kinds of risks that strategists so often warn investors to be on the lookout for.\n\nBut ahead of this week\u2019s Fed meeting, financial markets are still telling you the most anticipated recession in history is canceled. At least for now. And it means markets are right back where they started before the last Fed meeting.\n\nEverything (six weeks) old in this market is new again.\n\nBy Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round.
