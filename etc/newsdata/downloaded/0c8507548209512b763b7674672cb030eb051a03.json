The forest yields 165,000 acres of old growth trees and 20,000 acres of new growth trees, according to the agency.\n\nThe draft environmental impact statement will be submitted to the Federal Register later this week, according to the USFS.\n\nPresident Trump first directed Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue George (Sonny) Ervin PerdueWe must reject the 'go big or go home' mentality of modern agriculture Overnight Energy: Perry denies he is planning to resign | Workers sue over Trump rule on pork inspections | Video shows cacti at national monument being bulldozed for border wall Workers sue over Trump administration rule that speeds inspection of pork products MORE to lift the restrictions on the Tongass under the \u201cRoadless Rule\u201d earlier this month, The Washington Post reported in August.\n\nSeveral Alaskan lawmakers have long sought an exemption to the rule in the area, arguing it would be a boost to the local economy.\n\nThe Post reported that multiple conversations between Trump and Alaska Gov. Michael J. Dunleavy (R) played a part in the administration's decision to change the rule.\n\nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairwoman Lisa Murkowski Lisa Ann MurkowskiGOP braces for impeachment brawl Murkowski warns against rushing to conclusions on Trump impeachment GOP requests update on criminal referrals prompted by 2018 Kavanaugh probe MORE (R-Alaska) said in a statement to the Post that the rule \u201cshould never have been applied to our state\u201d and added that it is \u201charming our ability to develop a sustainable, year-round economy for the Southeast region, where less than one percent of the land is privately held.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe timber industry has declined precipitously, and it is astonishing that the few remaining mills in our nation\u2019s largest national forest have to constantly worry about running out of supply,\u201d she added.\n\nNearly 6 million acres of the Tongass forest is designated as wilderness by Congress, and will remain off limits.\n\nSeveral other lawmakers blasted the decision Tuesday.\n\nRepublican Rep. Ruben Gallego Ruben Gallego2020 Democrats raise alarm about China's intellectual property theft Harris picks up endorsement from influential lawmaker as support slips Democratic lawmaker: Russia, China benefitting from continued US troop presence in Afghanistan MORE, a subcommittee chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, said the decision would open the forest to \"clear-cutting.\"\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s rushed and reckless plan to allow clear-cutting and road-building in huge swaths of Alaska\u2019s Tongass National Forest will cause harm for generations to come,\u201d Gallego said in a statement. \u201cTongass National Forest is not only a pristine national treasure, the largest intact temperate forest in the world, and a key part of local tourism and recreation economies \u2013 it is also one of our most effective tools to mitigate climate change for future generations.\n\nSenator Maria Cantwell Maria Elaine CantwellZuckerberg defends meetings with conservative politicians, pundits Democrats urge Rick Perry not to roll back lightbulb efficiency rules Hillicon Valley: Trump official declines to testify on trade protections for tech | Senators call for better info-sharing on supply chain threats | Apple pulls app after Chinese pressure MORE (D-WA), a senior member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee called the decision a victim of a \"backroom political deal.\"\n\n\u201cWe need to protect the Tongass so that future generations can continue to benefit from the clean air and water and the 10,000 sustainable jobs this ancient ecosystem provides. The vast majority of Americans want to see the Tongass protected and I am optimistic the courts will once again overturn the administration\u2019s scientifically shoddy environmental review process.\u201d\n\nRebecca Klar contributed.", "description": "The Trump administration is teeing up plans to reverse a long-standing limit on logging in Alaska\u2019s Tongass National Forest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_101119getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
