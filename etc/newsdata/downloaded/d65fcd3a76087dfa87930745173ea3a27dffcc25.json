That\u2019s because about 90 percent of the energy a washing machine uses goes toward heating water.\n\nThere are some situations where you probably should use hot water: cleaning bed linens after being sick, for instance, or washing sweaty gym gear. An occasional hot wash can also help with general hygiene, Ms. Morgan said. Aside from that, though, stick to cold water.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the cold setting may still heat the water in your machine to as much as 80 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 27 Celsius. Check to see if your washer has a \u201ctap cold\u201d option and, if so, use it.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind: The temperature recommendations on clothing labels represent \u201cthe highest spectrum clothes can handle,\u201d said Melissa Hockstad, president and chief executive of the American Cleaning Institute. So you don\u2019t necessarily need to go that hot.\n\nThe benefits of cold washing are numerous. One calculation from the cleaning institute, using Energy Star data, estimated that a household could cut its emissions by 864 pounds of carbon per year by washing four out of five loads in cold water.", "description": "Also this week, news about meat and what it means for climate.", "authors": ["Kyla Mandel", "Brad Plumer"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/climate/02cli-newsletter-laundry/02cli-newsletter-laundry-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
