Of the 19 latest-year editions and models IIHS tested, 13 avoided pedestrians entirely, or at least managed to reduce speeds significantly.\n\nWhile the best-performing cars included luxury models Audi A4, BMW 3 series and a version of the Mercedes-Benz C-class, IIHS also gave its best rating to the Nissan Maxima and Volvo S60.\n\nThe Chevrolet Malibu, a Ford Fusion, Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima, were among tested cars that did not reduce speeds in some tests or failed entirely.\n\nThe IIHS testing scenarios included an adult crossing the road, a child darting out from behind an obstacle and an adult walking near the edge of the road - situations that account for more than half of all pedestrian deaths.\n\nAll tests were conducted during the day and on dry roads, as those are the only scenarios for which automakers currently commit their technology, said IIHS President David Harkey.\n\n\u201cThis technology is in its infancy,\u201d Harkey said in a phone interview. \u201cBut let\u2019s acknowledge what the automakers are doing well and encourage them to do more.\u201d\n\nTests by the American Automobile Association (AAA) earlier this month showed more devastating results when the technology is tested at night, a time when 75% of pedestrian fatalities occur.\n\nNone of the 2019 test cars - a Chevrolet Malibu, Honda Accord, Tesla Model 3 and Toyota Camry - was able to detect an adult pedestrian in the dark.\n\nIIHS\u2019s Harkey called on automakers to also develop better headlights to allow systems to spot pedestrians at night.", "description": "The performance of modern pedestrian detection systems varies widely between carmakers, with high-end luxury brands generally faring better and other models failing to recognize pedestrians altogether, according to a study released on Tuesday by a U.S. insurance research group.", "authors": ["Tina Bellon", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446318751&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0MJ", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
