Jeong is known to have introduced Yun to Seungri, whose real name is Lee Seung-hyun. In 2016 when the Suseo Police Precinct in Gangnam District investigated Jeong on suspicions of embezzlement, Yun is believed to have interfered, leading police to send the case to the prosecution with a recommendation that Jeong not be indicted.In July 2017, Yun was dispatched to the Blue House for a year, working under the supervision of President Moon Jae-in\u2019s then-senior secretary for civil affairs, Cho Kuk, who\u2019s now the justice minister. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office that\u2019s currently investigating the Burning Sun scandal is also probing a litany of allegations surrounding Cho and his family.Co-Link Private Equity, an investment company in which Cho\u2019s family heavily invested in, is the largest shareholder of WFM, a secondary battery company. In 2014, WFM invested in Cubes, which later changed its name to the current Nokwon C&I. Yun is known to have purchased 50 million won ($41,800) worth of Cubes stock.BY LEE SUNG-EUN, YONHAP [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
