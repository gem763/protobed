And I think it will work,\u201d Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh.\n\n\u201cCarbon is a resource. It is not something that we should just throw and just emit it. Actually, capturing it makes us make money out of it.\u201d\n\nHe said the kingdom currently operates the largest carbon capture and utilization plant in the world, turning half a million tons of CO2 annually into products such as fertilizers and methanol.\n\n\u201cWe also operate one of the regions most advanced CO2 enhanced oil recovery plants that captures and stores 800,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually,\u201d he said, adding Riyadh planned to deploy more carbon capture, utilization and storage infrastructure around the kingdom.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s energy price reforms and efficiency program will help reduce local demand by as much as two million barrels per day of oil equivalent by 2030 compared with previous projections, Prince Abdulaziz said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Sylvia Westall; Editing by Mark Potter)", "description": "RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia plans to launch a carbon trading scheme as the G20 member aims to diversify its energy supplies and reduce carbon emissions, the energy minister of the world\u2019s top oil producer said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Rania El Gamal"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
