But such discoveries came as little surprise to me from a man whose government has an appalling track record with minority rights and who has been accused of cultural appropriation while in office.\n\nFaux-liberalism has engulfed international politics across the world as politicians seek to win over hearts and minds and counter the rise of Trump and Brexit-style populism. Trudeau, and other aspiring leaders, have consistently painted themselves as liberals while enacting disastrous policies with a smile. As a white male, born into privilege and political dynasty, Trudeau needed to appeal to Canada\u2019s growing minority community in order to stay relevant. Race, environment, sexuality and gender issues all feature prominently in his speeches and campaigns \u2014 but they were merely approached as \u201ccheck-box\u201d exercises with few concrete policies to back them up, according to his former parliamentary secretary, Celina Caeser-Chavannes.\n\nTrudeau, who from the outset painted himself (excuse the irony) as a liberal and devout supporter of minority communities, used this platform to win an election in Canada. But beneath all these proclamations lie a slew of controversial policies. Trudeau has been outspoken about his support of refugee communities, yet this April he introduced a bill making it harder for migrants to reach Canada. Much media hype surrounded the arrival of Syrian refugees to Canada; however, Trudeau concurrently supported airstrikes in Syria, perpetuating the creation of refugees.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

And applauded for a gender-equal cabinet, Trudeau\u2019s government refused to approve electoral reform which would have given more women access to becoming politicians.\n\nSimilarly, after claiming to lead a radically transparent administration, Trudeau found himself riled in corruption allegations after helping Quebec-based construction company SNC-Lavalin avoid a corruption trial. His government was said to have pressured Jody Wilson-Raybould, the first indigenous woman to hold the position of Justice Minister, to support SNC-Lavalin, leaving her to resign and state the Trudeau government has \u201cundeniable elements of misogyny.\u201d Trudeau also made a campaign pledge of $2.4bn in aid to support education in First Nation communities which First Nation leaders say he has not honoured.\n\nUnearthed Justin Trudeau video shows him in blackface\n\nThere are shades of Trudeau-type faux-liberalism across the world. Hillary Clinton, for instance, ran a 2016 campaign championing inclusivity under the banner of \u201cKove Trumps Hate\u201d, despite supporting interventionism in Libya and Syria. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the Democratic presidential hopeful, has stood on a liberal platform while similarly proving himself to be weak on minority rights, through troubled economic policies affecting his city\u2019s poorest, poor gun control and poor handling of police brutality against the black community.\n\nOn a global scale, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman flew across the globe selling his idea of liberal reforms, such as allowing women to drive, while simultaneously jailing women\u2019s rights activists. His liberal reforms have provided sufficient cover for the death of hundreds of thousands of lives in a brutal war in Yemen. Such thinly masked pseudo-liberalism allows for the continued arms sales by western powers (including Trudeau\u2019s Canada) to Saudi Arabia, as well as invitations of tequila from fun-loving Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson.\n\nAs a writer of color, I am less offended by Trudeau\u2019s racist actions in his youth than I am by his more controversial policies \u2014 and the fact that many forget to criticize them because of his perfectly crafted soundbites espousing liberalism. It\u2019s time issues such as race are not used as cheap points in elections, and the focus is turned to policies rather than rhetoric. If we learn anything from this episode, it should be that.", "description": "As elections loom, revelations from Justin Trudeau\u2019s past \u2014 specifically times when he donned black- and brownface in an offensive parody of minority communities \u2014 have shaken up liberal Canada.", "authors": ["Ahmed Twaij"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/16/Justin-Trudeau.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
