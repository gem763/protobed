Atm, Monday\u2019s episode of Love Island is primo, because there\u2019s been DAYS of content for the producers to work with. By the end of the week it kinda peters out and is a bit snoozey.\n\nWe come back to the Islanders as they\u2019re playing a mildly drunk game of Truth Jenga, which is basically Jenga but there\u2019s truth and dare tiles. Of course at some point someone dares the boys to kiss, so Yoghurt kisses Matt then freaks out into oblivion.\n\nJordan says her first attraction in the villa was Yoghurt, and then Matt says out of Vanessa and Jordan he\u2019d pick Jordan. It\u2019s all very Yoghurt vs. Matt, and I just feel this can only end in tears.\n\nThere\u2019s also, of course, girl-doing-sexual-act-on-boy, which Yoghurt loses his fucking mind over.\n\nJordan takes Yoghurt aside and is all \u201cok so you ONLY like me now?\u201d and he\u2019s like yes, I was just sexually attracted to Isabelle but you are my normal type. Whatever the fuck that means. It\u2019s all veeeery convenient considering a) Isabelle doesn\u2019t actually like Yoghurt and b) Yoghurt fucked it with Jessie.\n\nJordan laps it up though because she\u2019s super into Yoghurt. She asks if he\u2019d pick her if he went before Matt in a recoupling, and he is very faux-distraught.\n\nLuke meanwhile told Isabelle he\u2019d pick her in the Jenga game, but then he\u2019s like \u201clol anything could happen\u201d which is just delightful and she obviously loves it. Not.\n\nHe\u2019s essentially like, I\u2019d pick Cassie if she was being more keen on me but she isn\u2019t. Which is not a good sign. The next morning he just stands in the shower naked and maybe crying, which is a vibe.\n\nMeanwhile we\u2019re reminded that the OG girls have been in jail for days. Did they get food? Did they get to shower? I have so many questions.\n\nThere\u2019s a cute moment where Josh and Adam talk about how excited they are to see Anna/Cartier. I mean it\u2019s cute if they\u2019re not just playing a long game, I\u2019m too cynical now \u2013 I don\u2019t trust anyone.\n\nLuke STILL hasn\u2019t bloody decided who he likes more, Cassie or Isabelle. Isabelle\u2019s quickly getting very over it.\n\nHe goes for a stress swim and then tries to drown himself. Also a vibe. This guy knows how to do a good anxiety sesh, let me tell you.\n\nJordan then pulls Yoghurt for a chat RIGHT IN FRONT OF MATT.\n\nYoghurt comes back and Big Dogs all over Matt, saying Jordan wants him and not Matt. Josh and Adam call him on his shit, being like \u201cdude, why didn\u2019t you choose her first\u201d and he\u2019s all \u201cI did it for Matt\u201d which they are hundo not buying.\n\nThen there\u2019s an awkward moment where Angel is all \u201cMatt I like you\u201d and he is very yeah nah about it and immediately tells Isabelle \u201cmaybe I should couple up with you\u201d. CHRIST. It\u2019s brutal. Angel walks off pretending to take it on the chin but mate, no human could.\n\nThen it\u2019s time for the OG\u2019s to go BACK INTO THE VILLA! But when they walk in, no one\u2019s around.\n\nTurns out the new girls and the dudes have vacated the premises, so they mooch around for a while before Jessie gets a text \u2013 go get changed because there\u2019s a recoupling.\n\nCynthia loses her shit in a moment of pure reality TV gold.\n\nSophie comes in wearing the dress Drew Barrymore wore in the Never Been Kissed flashback scene.\n\nShe tells the OGs that all the dudes are coming back in, but MAYBE with new ladies. But first up is previously single Matt, who comes in with\u2026 Isabelle. Interesting.\n\nJessie gives Isabelle the fakest smile I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nThen Cartier stands up, ready to face Adam \u2013 new partner or not. He barrels in, and it\u2019s VERY fucking cute you guys.\n\nThen Cynthia stands to wait for her \u201cfriend\u201d Gerard. Anyone else ship these two? I know Gerard\u2019s into Jessie but I\u2019d way rather see him with Cynthia. He returns solo and tells Sophie it\u2019s because he wants to pursue Jessie, who is fucking stoked.\n\nThen it\u2019s Cassie\u2019s turn \u2013 Luke comes back solo, and she\u2019s stoked\u2026 but then he tells Sophie he\u2019s been weighing two girls up in his mind. Isabelle watches on like \u201cfucken what are you gonna say about me mate huh? HUH?\u201d\n\nHe then comes out with it and says the other woman was Isabelle, and it\u2019s all bitchy looks round the fire pit, baby!\n\nAnna and Josh reunite, blah blah then it\u2019s time for Jessie. We all know Yoghurt\u2019s walking in with Jordan, and while Jessie\u2019s like \u201cwell I wanna get to know Gerard so I hope Yoghurt\u2019s moved on\u201d her face when he DOES indeed prove he\u2019s moved on is, well\u2026\n\nYoghurt looks like a smug cunt, of course.\n\nAll the single ladies \u2013 including the spare Bomb Squad \u2013 line up. They\u2019re all at risk of being dumped, but there\u2019s a twist. BAM! New guy Aaron starts strutting in and he\u2019s QUITE the babe.\n\nWe\u2019re left on a cliffhanger \u2013 is the deal that only one girl will be saved by Aaron? Is some other shit going down? I hate cliffhangers, I have hives from anxiety now.
