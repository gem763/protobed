It would also be brighter on one side than the other.\n\nBut if you were to look at the black hole from up above, the ring would form a near-perfect circle and the light would appear more evenly distributed.\n\nThis creates a kind of fun-house mirror effect in which your vantage point changes your view.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more.\n\nUntil recently, scientists could only speculate about the appearance of a black hole.\n\nGiven that a black hole\u2019s gravitational pull is so strong that anything, including light, gets devoured, it\u2019s extremely difficult to capture one on camera. To see a black hole at all, we have to rely on light from the stars and other matter that get sucked in (before they disappear).\n\nIn April, a group of scientists from the international Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration published the world\u2019s first photograph of a black hole. The image validated our understanding of black holes as dark spheres surrounded by a glowing ring of light, but the photo looked more like a smudge than a detailed snapshot.\n\nA new video from NASA, however, shows what the black hole might look like if researchers were able to film it in action \u2013 or if you just happened to be hanging out nearby.\n\nIn the animation, gravity twists light into a mesmerizing gyre that shifts based on your vantage point.\n\nThe visualization first shows what a black hole would look like from the side (the way it appears in the still image above): You\u2019d see a dark sphere in the center. That\u2019s the hole\u2019s \u201cshadow\u201d \u2013 where light gets bent and captured. The boundary of that shadow is known as the \u201cevent horizon\u201d or \u201cpoint of no return,\u201d since beyond that, a black hole\u2019s gravitational force is strong enough to suck anything that approaches into the abyss.\n\nJust outside the event horizon is a thin halo known as a \u201cphoton sphere,\u201d which consists of light rays circling the black hole.\n\nsource NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center/Jeremy Schnittman\n\nThe most captivating part of the visualization, however, is the outer ring of hot matter known as the \u201caccretion disk.\u201d It\u2019s made of dead stars, planets, asteroids, comets, and other particles that are dragged in by hole\u2019s gravitational pull. (NASA scientists just caught one of these star deaths on camera.)\n\nThe path of light appears to bend around the sphere, forming a hump at the bottom and top. The disk is brighter on the left side because the glowing gas there would be moving toward you at close to the speed of light. The gas on the right side is moving away from you, so it\u2019s not as luminous. (Think of the way a beam from a lighthouse becomes insanely bright when it\u2019s pointed directly at you.)\n\nBut things change in the visualization when you look at the black hole from above. Suddenly, the bright light becomes evenly dispersed because, from that vantage point, no parts of the disk are moving toward or away from you. The disk also forms a neat circle instead of the \u201cdouble hump\u201d you\u2019d see from the side angle. The photon sphere stays the same, though, because light is essentially trapped there in perfect orbit.\n\nTake a look:\n\nNASA compares this stretching, twisting, bending journey of light to a carnival mirror.\n\n\u201cSimulations and movies like these really help us visualize what Einstein meant when he said that gravity warps the fabric of space and time,\u201d Jeremy Schnittman, the NASA astrophysicist who created the visualization, said in a statement.\n\nThe animation also gives context to the black hole photograph released in April. In that photo, the accretion disk looked significantly brighter on the bottom of the image and darker on the top. NASA\u2019s visualization is a reminder that a view like that would change based on our location.", "description": "Business Insider - The visualization gives context to the first-ever photograph of a black hole, which scientists released in April..
