It can only investigate whether he or she broke the law after invoking its impeachment power.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cInvestigations of impeachable offenses simply are not, and never have been, within Congress\u2019s legislative power,\u201d Rao wrote, noting that \u201ceven a valid legislative purpose\u201d would not justify an investigation. Under her approach, the judiciary has the power to quash an impeachment inquiry and \u201cdetermine the scope of impeachable offenses.\u201d\n\nTo the extent Congress launched an investigation purely to determine whether the president (or any other impeachable official) committed a crime, Rao is correct in her dissent. Congress\u2019s oversight and legislative roles permit it to decide how to appropriately address concerns of illegality. It has a constitutional prerogative to initiate an impeachment inquiry, though there\u2019s no precedent that compels Congress to forgo its legislative role when faced with a potential misconduct and limit itself to the impeachment process.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe dissent would reorder the very structure of the Constitution,\u201d said the opinion, authored by Judge David S. Tatel and joined by Judge Patricia Millett, both of whom were appointed by Democratic presidents.\n\nAD\n\nRao, a former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and a Trump nominee who filled Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s seat on the D.C. Circuit when he was confirmed to the Supreme Court, adopted Trump\u2019s argument that Congress issued the subpoena not to aid in weighing whether to enact new laws but merely as a pretext to investigate possible violations of existing ones; enforcing the subpoena, she said, would be likening Congress to \u201ca roving inquisition over a coequal branch of government.\"\n\nHowever, the court\u2019s majority found that the subpoena was \u201cvalid and enforceable\u201d and the documents sought by Congress were relevant to determining the need for new legislation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThroughout history, the Constitution has left to Congress the judgment whether to commence the impeachment process,\u201d wrote Tatel. \u201cBut the dissent\u2019s approach would not even allow Congress to make the quintessentially legislative judgment that some concerns about potential misconduct or illegality are better addressed through oversight and legislation than impeachment.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTatel, a Bill Clinton appointee, continued, \u201cWe detect no inherent constitutional flaw in laws requiring Presidents to publicly disclose certain financial information. And that is enough.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s decision is just the most recent in a series of lawsuits in which Trump has argued a broad claim of presidential immunity and suggested that a sitting president cannot be criminally investigated, ever. Now, with several matters still pending, the looming question is whether the Supreme Court will intervene \u2014 and, if it does, whether the justices will rely on Rao\u2019s dissent as precedent.\n\nAD\n\nThe split at the D.C. Circuit has also divided the legal community.\n\n\u201cThe decision [by Rao] is so totally wrong on the law and history that I don\u2019t see it as being particularly useful,\u201d Elizabeth Wydra, president of the constitutional Accountability Center, a legal group that filed a brief in this case, told The Post. \u201cFollowing it would be an extraordinary step that would impact not only this president in continuing to act as if he\u2019s above the law, but also on our constitutional system of checks and balances going forward.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nExperts who agree with Wydra called Rao\u2019s dissent \u201cwhackadoodle\u201d and \u201cprofoundly antidemocratic.\u201d But others have described it as \u201cthoughtful\u201d and \u201cnot the hack-job Twitter would have you believe.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn a piece published by The Washington Post on Monday, Steve Vladeck, professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said the opinion forewarned \u201cthe real constitutional crisis to come.\u201d\n\nHistorically, \u201cthe unanimity of the court\u2019s ruling made clear that compliance was the only available outcome,\u201d said Vladeck, citing major civil rights cases and even the decision compelling Nixon to comply with the special prosecutor\u2019s subpoena.\n\nA court that speaks in unison is undoubtedly stronger. Rao\u2019s dissent, Vladeck said, \u201craises the possibility that, were the court to reach the merits of one of these cases, at least some of the justices might be similarly inclined. Now, at least, such a vote wouldn\u2019t be the first, and there\u2019s a lengthy lower court opinion on which such a vote could rely.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nAD", "description": "Could a split decision from the D.C.
