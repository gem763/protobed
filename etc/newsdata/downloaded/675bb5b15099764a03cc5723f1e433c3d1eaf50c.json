Note, so as long as Republicans control Congress, there will be a very high bar indeed for any effort to impeach Trump to gain traction. The main beneficiaries of the convolution state of affairs in Washington when the proverbial hits the fan in equities and bonds gets bought up as protection vehicles included the usual suspects, that is, the yen and the Swissy. The beta currencies, especially the New Zealand dollar, also saw consistent demand ahead of the RBNZ policy meeting, as did the AUD, even if the appreciation was much more sudden after the market interpreted RBA Lowe speech on the economy on Tuesday as a strong hint that lower rates in the country may not come as early as expected. Lastly, the Canadian dollar and the euro were both on the bottom side of the performing board with the former dragged down by lower Oil while the latter suffering from bleak fundamentals in the euro area, even if it could have been worse on Tuesday, as the German didn't come as bad as feared.\n\nNarratives In Financial Markets\n\n* The Information is gathered after scanning top publications including the FT, WSJ, Reuters, Bloomberg, ForexLive, Institutional Bank Research reports.\n\nTrump impeachment spooks markets: The proceedings for a formal impeachment inquiry on President Trump by Democrats is officially underway after a press conference by House Speaker Pelosi, which led to a major setback in risk trades as equities and bonds yields experienced sharp falls while the price of gold jumped, in part driven by broad-based USD weakness. The controversy around allegations that President Trump tried to exert pressure on Ukraine's government to investigate Joe Biden and his son has been the catalyst. The President has vowed he will make public an unedited transcript of his talk with the Ukrainian President.\n\nTrump throws a curve ball to China: The speech by Trump in the UN threw further fueled into the sell-off in risk trades as he takes a very critical stance towards China, Iran and social media enterprises. On China, the president said that \u201cnot only has China declined to adopt promised reforms, but it has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping, forced technology transfers, and the theft of intellectual property and trade secrets on a grand scale.\u201d While Trump\u2019s speech implied he still hopes for a deal to be done, he added \u201cas I have made very clear, I will not accept a bad deal for the American people\u201d. You\u2019d think this was a good opportunity for Trump to tone things down a tad after China gave waivers to local state and private companies to purchase US soybeans tariff-free, but it didn\u2019t seem to matter for Trump.\n\nUK PM suffers major setback: The sterling found buying interest after the ruling of the UK Supreme Court unanimously determined as unlawful UK PM Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament, effectively giving the green light for the Speaker of the House to reconvene Parliament tomorrow. Opposition parties are calling for Johnson to resign, with a potential confidence vote to remove Johnson from office a real possibility. It remains to be seen whether or not pro-EU Tories will support the notion, which is a key determiner to see the motion succeed. The risk that the government collapses, which may lead to a unity government taking over, makes the prospects of an extension of Article 50 more likely. Also, the resumption of Parliamentary session gives more chances for MPs to block a no-deal Brexit.\n\nRBA Lowe speech lowers chances of Oct cut: The found solid demand before retracing as risk-off ensued, following an upbeat . The much-awaited speech on the Australian economy didn\u2019t disappoint for those volatility seekers, resulting in a significant jump in the AUD as the remarks were interpreted as not carrying the urgency to cut rates further in October just yet. This was manifested in pricing out a 25bp rate cut from 82% to 60%. Lowe said that \u201cafter having been through a soft patch, a gentle turning point has been reached\u201d and he added \u201cthe fundamental factors underpinning the longer-term outlook for the Australian economy remain strong.\u201d Lowe also added some ambiguity to his speech by noting that \u201cfurther monetary easing may well be required.\u201d\n\nPoor US economic data: The US September underwhelmed at 125.1 vs 133.0 expected, coming off a prior print of 135.1, which was the highest since 2000. The sharp drop, including the lowest level in expectations since January was a red flag. The poor result follows a similar disappointment in the University of Michigan consumer confidence survey. Meanwhile, the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index for September -9 vs. 1 estimate. The soft data in the US kickstarted the weakness seen in the US dollar this Tuesday.\n\nGermany\u2019s IFO not as bad as feared: The business climate index didn\u2019t come that bad even if the expectations remain at the lowest in a decade. Besides, unlike the , where evidence started to emerge about the recession in the manufacturing survey spilling over into the services sector, this time the IFO failed to show proof of that.\n\nRBNZ policy decision up next: The next key focus in Asia will be the , with the Central Bank expected to keep its powder dry by not touching its rate settings this time. The pricing for a 25bp rate cut today stands at just over 10%, with calls for further easing around November standing at a 90% conviction, which is the current pricing for a cut even if that scenario will vary today based on the update in the NZ economy by the RBNZ.\n\nRecent Economic Indicators & Events Ahead\n\nSource: Forexfactory\n\nA Dive Into The Charts\n\nThe index has transitioned very rapidly from its daily resistance area into a demand vicinity where chances are that a buy-side campaign may be re-initiated judging by the number of times the level has proven to act as an accurate location to bid up the single currency. Since the last test of the level on Sept 16 led to a successful price rotation, it provides further credence that buyers may show up to move the price away towards a retest of the daily baseline, which gives about 0.2-0.25% of room available. Should the level of support be violated, it will then lead to the index falling an additional 0.2% until the next level of daily support, as depicted by the lowest red line, is tested.\n\nThe index saw a spike that came to an abrupt stop at the 100% proj level (in magenta line), now acting as clear resistance, and proof of that is the number of times is acting as a reactionary level. As long as the sell-side pressure keeps emerging out of the 100% proj level, the risk of further setbacks into the daily baseline is a real possibility. If that test of the baseline were to eventuate, the area offers a great confluence for bids to return as the baseline converges with a level of support, most visible in the 8h chart, hence why it\u2019s drawn in blue to make that distinction. The playbook in the GBP remains uncertain and totally dominated by Brexit as usual.\n\nThe index outlook is much more uncertain after a commanding red candle on the daily managed to penetrate the baseline with an increase in aggregate tick volume. Note, the over extension of Tuesday\u2019s movement may create potential opportunities to buy the US dollar currency at fairly attractive levels for a retest of the daily baseline. That said, there are no technical grounds to be too optimistic on long swing trades in the USD as the daily candle close at the very low means the buying pressure has temporarily evaporated.\n\nThe index continues to be sandwiched between support and resistance, effectively allowing the currency for gyrations worth over 0.5% before failing to auction beyond these parameters. The critical and most immediate levels to watch out for have been drawn in blue, as these are best observed through the 8h chart as opposed to the daily. Whenever a chart enters conditions of choppiness as is the case here, the baseline should be shrugged off and keep the focus on engaging in buy or sell side opportunities at the edges of the range to maximize risk reward.\n\nThe index has come to the anticipated level of resistance, from where anything can occur, which will be totally dependent on the outcome of the RBNZ policy meeting. If the RBNZ sounds less dovish, the baseline on the daily is the next level to target, while a more dovish interpretation would see the underlying bearish trend to resume for a potential retest of the low.\n\nThe AUD index keeps finding demand imbalances, with the price moving further away from a critical level of daily support, outlined in a red line. The current inertia is for the currency to keep recovering further ground for a potential test of the baseline, an area confluent with a daily level of horizontal resistance as per the swing low back in mid June. Any setback in the price of the is set to find further pockets of demand as the line of daily support gets retested.\n\nThe JPY index is currently compressed between a level of resistance (in red) overhead and a level of support, from where the price bounced from on Tuesday. Looking for trades away from these areas offers attractive propositions and the most technical clarity to initiate buy-sell trades. Even if one can observe that the index has recovered the baseline with an increase in aggregate tick volume, it\u2019s problematic to enter trades straight into a level of resistance, as it allows very little room for the price to maneuver before the anticipated sell pressure arises.\n\nThe index should continue to struggle at these high levels as a level of key daily resistance has now taken over the proceedings, from where supply imbalances may ensue. To the downside, assuming that sellers do take temporary control off the resistance level, there is room for about 0.25% of depreciation in the index before buying activity returns with more conviction, as that\u2019s where a powerful combination of the daily baseline + horizontal level meet.\n\nImportant Footnotes", "description": "Forex Analysis by Ivan Delgado covering: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CHF, AUD/USD.
