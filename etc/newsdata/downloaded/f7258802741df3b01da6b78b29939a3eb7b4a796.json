Whereas many voters and strategists have previously been happy to talk about the benefits of a broad church when it comes to presidential candidates, now the tide is turning. Electability is back on the agenda \u2013 and people across the spectrum are having to accept that their favoured candidate might not be the one who makes the most sense.\n\nOn 2 October, Bernie Sanders suffered a medical emergency which everyone knew \u2013 but his team refused to confirm \u2013 was a heart attack. It was only two days later that they finally admitted he had indeed suffered one, and the response has been predictable. Many diehard Sanders supporters are now cautiously backing away. I\u2019ve spoken to a few in the last few days who have told me that they\u2019re still fully committed to the left-wing liberal ideas Bernie stands for, but they don\u2019t think he\u2019s the best one to deliver them in 2020.\n\nIncreasingly, people are turning to Elizabeth Warren for that instead. She is visibly in better health and quicker and slicker in her live debate responses. Her legendary four-hour selfie lines, if anything, are testament to her stamina.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nMany right-leaning Democrats are also abandoning their preferred moderate candidate, Joe Biden. He has been harmed by the Ukraine scandal; Trump and his team have prioritised deflecting accusations of corruption onto him, and they\u2019re starting to take hold. Uncle Joe\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, did nothing legally wrong by sitting on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, but his promotion to that post \u2013 with the huge salary attached \u2013 does look horribly nepotistic. Trump got in with a promise about \u201cdraining the swamp\u201d, and Joe Biden has come out of this looking like a swamp monster. He\u2019s exactly the kind of DC-insider politician America has recently fallen out of love with, and Democrats are now worrying his candidacy would mean Hillary Clinton all over again.\n\nUnless Biden or Sanders rally, we may well see both bases defect to Warren, an ex-Republican with economic nous who can tempt Biden voters, and a public advocate of socialist policies straight from the playbook of Sanders. There\u2019s still over a year in it, however, and it\u2019s fair to say that this is an election where anything could happen.\n\nThe people who turned out for Trump in droves in 2016 weren\u2019t just Republicans; they were independents. Common in \u201cdecider\u201d states like Iowa and New Hampshire, it\u2019s worth noting that recent polls have shown their support for impeachment. That spells big trouble for Trump. If the Democratic nominee is smart, they will address those voters now in order to shore up a strong base for 2020 \u2013 in other words, they\u2019ll have to play Trump at his own game.\n\nYours,\n\nHolly Baxter\n\nUS comment editor", "description": "As the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump rumbles on, Democrats have been putting their game faces on for the 2020 election.
