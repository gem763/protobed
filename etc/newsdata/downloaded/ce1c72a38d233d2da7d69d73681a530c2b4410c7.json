Her global campaigning efforts, candid talks with photo-hungry politicians and her ability to hold powerful world leaders triple her age to account have proved as much. Yet it seems the jury is still out on her leadership style.\n\nThere are some who gaze upon her incredible resolve in awe; there are others who insist on demonising her, their objections to her \u201ccredibility\u201d often exposing latent sexism, ageism and ableism too. Happily, there are far more who consider her the climate crisis hero we\u2019ve all been waiting for: righteous youthful frustration personified \u2013 and a baby boomer\u2019s nightmare.\n\nWhatever your position, there\u2019s no denying the power of her words: \u201cYou all come to us young people for hope? How dare you?\u201d, she said, in an electrifying speech at the United Nations climate change summit on Monday.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThose of us already fighting with her \u2013 myself included, I admit \u2013 lapped it up. Chelsea Clinton, a member of the global elite that Thunberg herself said she would \u201cnot let get away with\u201d inaction on the climate crisis, thanked her for her courage. Other political figures praised the teenager for her \u201cactivism, persistence and passion\u201d, ignoring the problem she\u2019d stood up to criticise in the first place: the world is refusing to let Greta, a child, gracefully step down from the pedestal she\u2019s been placed upon.\n\nInstead of showing adult leadership, and finding a way to make the sort of change that young activists such as Thunberg are crying out for, we have instead saddled this 16-year-old girl with the weight of the world\u2019s problems. We\u2019ve ignored pleas for us to listen to the experts, to actually do something, rather than making empty promises such as parliament\u2019s symbolic declaration of a climate emergency earlier this year (after supporting airport expansion at Heathrow the year before). And we have also, disappointingly, ignored the pleas of others who have dedicated their lives to similar causes and movements, many years before any of us became familiar with Thunberg\u2019s trademark pigtail braids.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It\u2019s ours.\n\nBut why has this young girl captured the public and political imagination? Why won\u2019t we let Greta go?\n\nIt\u2019s not only because our politicians haven\u2019t the grit for true moral leadership, although that\u2019s obviously a factor. It\u2019s also because she exemplifies the acceptable face of protest. She\u2019s a face and a voice that allows our leaders to go on ignoring other, more marginalised, voices and campaigns too.\n\nThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve never heard of Ella Kissi-Debrah, the nine-year-old black girl who died after a long battle with severe asthma and seizures linked to \u201cillegally high levels of pollution\u201d in the UK. Her mother, Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, has worked tirelessly to get us to pay attention \u2013 yet still seems to be having a hard time getting the nation to speak her daughter\u2019s name and take up the fight with her.\n\nIn the US, a group of Native American teenagers led the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, raising the issue to millions of people who otherwise would have remained ignorant about the dangers of a multibillion-dollar move to transport oil through four states \u2013 a move that they\u2019re seeking to expand right now. They, curiously, did not receive the same global reception as young Thunberg.\n\nNor did Amariyanna Copeny, also known as \u201cLittle Miss Flint\u201d, the 11-year-old girl who has spent much of her childhood trying to raise awareness about the contaminated water crisis in her Michigan city, a situation that is playing out elsewhere in the US.\n\nAccording to the IPCC, \u201cby 2050, one in every 45 people in the world will have 12 been displaced by climate change\u201d. Yet the image of thousands upon thousands of young migrants, many of whom have fled their countries directly because of various issues directly related to extreme weather, haven\u2019t been enough to convince the world\u2019s leaders to act fast. It hasn\u2019t sparked an overdue global conversation on the role of capitalism in exacerbating the impact of climate change.\n\nI don\u2019t want to suggest that campaigning has been, if you\u2019ll excuse the pun, plain-sailing for Thunberg. A minor, she\u2019s nevertheless been a target of cruel attacks from adults everywhere. She\u2019s been reduced to nothing more than a \u201chappy, young girl\u201d by Donald Trump in spite of the impact of her words in just 12 short months. She\u2019s had her autism used as a rhetorical tool, and her family history picked apart. Like many young women in the public eye, she\u2019s also been pointless and infuriatingly told to smile more.\n\nAnd now, her energies are being exploited by those adults who are letting her do their work for them.\n\nAs long as children feel the need to say the things powerful leaders refuse to say, we have a duty to listen to them \u2013 regardless of how they make us feel. Even more importantly, we have a duty to give back to these inspirational youngsters the childhoods they are being collectively robbed of. And that starts with behaving like adults, and taking the lead.", "description": "Greta Thunberg is a force to be reckoned with.
