Maddie Nelson, 18, told Fox 13 Now that she had spent years performing vape tricks and testing out new products, but had been dealing with mild symptoms for several months before her health quickly went downhill.\n\n\u201cI had fat particles growing inside my lungs that were related to the glycerin in vape juice,\u201d Nelson told Fox 13 Now. \u201cSo then my lungs were full of fluid.

Patients have reported experiencing shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain and vomiting. Doctors say the illnesses resemble an inhalation injury, with the body apparently reacting to a caustic substance that someone breathed in.\n\nFox News' Madeline Farber contributed to this report.", "description": "The warning comes after officials said they had identified a possible 450 cases of illness, including three deaths.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/05/694940094001_6083692404001_6083685305001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
