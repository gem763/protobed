Read more\n\nThe hearing opened on Tuesday with anti-Brexit protesters massing outside the supreme court, directly opposite parliament in Westminster, bearing signs declaring: \u201cDon\u2019t silence our MP\u201d, \u201cReopen parliament\u201d and \u201cThey misled the Queen\u201d.\n\nEleven supreme court justices are sitting for three days to consider appeals from the high court in London and the appeal court in Edinburgh, which reached diametrically opposed views on the lawfulness of Johnson\u2019s actions. The English court ruled it did not have legal authority to examine the prime minister\u2019s decision; the Scottish judges declared he had acted illegally to stifle debate in the Commons.\n\nBefore arguments formally opened, Lady Hale, the supreme court president, acknowledged that it had \u201cserious and difficult questions\u201d before it. That was evidenced, she said, \u201cby the fact that three senior judges in Scotland have reached a different conclusion to three senior judges in England and Wales\u201d.\n\nShe continued: \u201cThe supreme court exists to decide such difficult questions of law and we shall do so in accordance with our judicial oath ...\u201d which declares that the judges will reach their conclusion \u201cwithout fear or favour, affection or ill will\u201d.\n\nLawyers for the prime minister said in written submissions that the claimants\u2019 argument risked creating a principle which \u201cwould involve the courts entering the political arena\u201d.\n\nIn the afternoon, Keen told the court that he was giving \u201ca clear undertaking that the prime would respect\u201d the court\u2019s eventual judgment. Kerr, a justice from Northern Ireland, then asked him: \u201cCan we take it that he [Johnson] wouldn\u2019t apply to have parliament prorogued again?\u201d Keen replied: \u201cI\u2019m not in a position to comment on that. That will have to be addressed by the decision maker [ie the prime minister].\u201d\n\nKeen, who is also the advocate general for Scotland, also told the supreme court that parliament could have resisted Boris Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen to prorogue the session and voted to resist the order to close it down for five weeks.\n\nSupreme court hearing on suspension of parliament \u2013 key issues Read more\n\nHis surprising assertion assumed that because parliament had chosen not to act, the courts should not be able to overrule what parliament itself had chosen not to do. If parliament could pass an act preventing a no-deal exit from the EU, Keen said, it could also have legislated, adopting mechanisms within the Northern Ireland Executive Formation Act 2019, to prevent itself being prorogued.\n\nLegal argument reached back as far as the often-cited 1610 Case of Proclamations, which imposed limits on the royal prerogative, and referred to William IV as the last monarch who in the 1830s exercised the royal right to prorogue parliament in person.\n\nThere were robust exchanges over the political precedent set by the postwar Labour government\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament twice in 1948. \u201cIt was a naked political use of the prerogative to force through its intended legislation notwithstanding it had no consent in the House of Lords,\u201d Keen told the supreme court.\n\nBut Lady Hale intervened: \u201cIt could be said it was in pursuit of democracy rather than opposed to it. To enforce the will of the House of Commons [to exert its authority over the unelected Lords]...\u201d Keen replied that prorogation on that occasion was an example of a government doing so \u201cwhere the executive wish to pursue a political objective and they are entitled to do so\u201d.\n\nEarlier Lord Pannick QC, who represents the businesswoman and legal campaigner Gina Miller, alleged that Johnson\u2019s motive for introducing a Commons prorogation of five weeks was \u201cto silence parliament for that period\u201d.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s extended suspension of MPs\u2019 debate was carried out for an \u201cimproper purpose\u201d, he added, to \u201cavoid the risk of parliament undermining the policies of his executive\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty to prorogue parliament for a period of five weeks is an unlawful abuse of power,\u201d Pannick told the court.\n\n\u201c[His] reasons for advising on a five-week prorogation were improper in that they were infected by factors inconsistent with the concept of parliamentary sovereignty, in particular his belief that parliament does nothing of value at this time of year and his concern that parliament might take steps which would undermine the government\u2019s negotiating position with the EU.\u201d\n\nA Northern Ireland prorogation claim, argued on behalf of Raymond McCord, a victims\u2019 rights campaigner whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries, will be heard on Thursday. Permission has also been given for five other interveners. They are: the lord advocate for the Scottish government, the counsel general for Wales, Sir John Major, Lady Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, and the Public Law Project.\n\nThe hearing, which is due to last three days, continues. The court, which is sitting for the first time ever outside its normal legal terms, is not expected to deliver to deliver its judgment before the end of Thursday at the earliest.", "description": "Supreme court told PM will \u2018abide\u2019 by any ruling but minister declines to say if MPs could be sent away again immediately", "authors": ["Owen Bowcott", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5269d4e6090db0716f481ccd92a12462ccb283a7/532_14_2272_1363/master/2272.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1ac9bae2c7aa0a5a9fc6712d9a5cd454", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
