Diversity is our strength <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WelcomeToCanada?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WelcomeToCanada</a> \u2014@JustinTrudeau\n\nClose to 50,000 people have entered Canada at the unofficial border crossing point in the last two years.\n\nThe crossing draws people from all over the world who are seeking asylum in Canada, many of whom are fleeing persecution, violence and poverty in their home countries.\n\nWhen they cross, they are usually met by RCMP officers, arrested and then processed to determine if they can apply for refugee status.\n\nIn 2018, Canada accepted 28,100 refugees out of 55,400 claims filed, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency.\n\nWhile the United Nations has ranked Canada as a world leader in welcoming refugees, a July poll commissioned by CBC News suggests that the majority of Canadians would favour accepting skilled migrants.\n\nKhanna said that if elected, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer \"will make sure the system is fair, that it's compassionate to help those that need help the most, and that there's order, which we don't see right now.\"\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, the country admitted 313,580 immigrants in 2018-19 , one of the highest levels in Canadian history. That figure includes refugees.\n\nKwan criticized the Liberals for supporting the Safe Third Country Agreement with the U.S. Under the deal, refugees must make their asylum claim in the first country they enter, so a migrant travelling through the U.S. to try to enter Canada would be sent back to the U.S. at the Canadian border.\n\nShe argued that tougher U.S. policies on immigration were driving refugees north, and forcing them to make irregular crossings so that they wouldn't immediately be turned back.\n\nThat's led to refugees \"risking life and limb,\" and \"creating havoc frankly at the border communities,\" she said.\n\n\"If we suspended the Safe Third Country Agreement , people would be able to cross over into Canada in an orderly fashion.\"\n\nTwo refugees from Ghana who walked into Canada during dangerous cold in December say it was worth the risk:\n\nTwo refugees from Ghana who walked into Canada during dangerous cold in December say it was worth the risk. 2:01\n\nAhmed Hussen, Liberal candidate for York South-Weston in Ontario, said that the deal is under review, but that any change \"requires the consent of all countries, the United States and Canada, and that work is ongoing.\"\n\n\"It's also about making sure that we resource our border officers adequately, making sure that we resource the Immigration and Refugee Board and fill the vacancies \u2014 but also resource that body for the actual number of asylum seekers in Canada.\"\n\nHe argued that the Liberals had \"closed the gaps\" left behind by Stephen Harper's Conservative government, which he said has led to the current backlog.\n\nKhanna argued that to solve the problem we need to have \"an actual leadership role, not blame other governments.\"\n\n\"We have to make sure this is a priority and we have to get things done,\" he said.\n\nWritten by Padraig Moran.
