The Trump administration recently issued new regulations to close the loopholes that enabled this abuse.\n\nThat\u2019s not how it\u2019s being depicted by some activists on the left, though. According to them, the Trump administration is \u201cliterally taking food out of lot of hungry people\u2019s mouths\u201d in order to score political points.\n\nThe reality: Americans are generous and compassionate. We spend more than $1.1 trillion per year providing cash, food, housing, and medical care through 90 major government programs to help the poor and near-poor. The administration\u2019s proposed reforms are a good first step toward needed changes to ensure our tax dollar investments go to the truly needy.\n\nThe administration\u2019s proposal reaffirms existing federal law defining who is eligible for food stamps. The reform is needed to reverse abuses enabled by Obama-era administration regulators via a concept called \u201cbroad-based categorical eligibility\u201d (BBCE).\n\nOn the surface, the idea seems well-intentioned: help hungry, low-income people who don\u2019t know they are eligible for help. In reality, states used it as a loophole to get around food stamps\u2019 federal eligibility limits, ignore the asset requirements in food stamps, and so allow millions of families with as much as $100,000 in cash in the bank to receive benefits.\n\n>>>How to Fight the War on Poverty\n\nStates are willing to game the system because 100% of the costs of food stamps are paid for by the federal government. It\u2019s highly unlikely they\u2019d waste their own money in this way.\n\nThe results? 34 states and Washington, D.C. use this loophole, and more than 5 million people now on the program don\u2019t meet the federal law\u2019s eligibility criteria for food stamps. These recipients include, according to research by the Foundation for Government Accountability, more than 10,000 lottery winners in Michigan and 4,000 lottery winners in Maine \u2013 some of whom won multimillion-dollar prizes. Plus the occasional millionaire with income or assets far above the federal limits.\n\nIn the case of millionaire Rob Undersand, he applied for food stamps to expose problems in Minnesota. He got approved for benefits \u2014 donating them to the needy \u2014 and went public because, as he says in a YouTube video, \u201che\u2019s not against the food stamp program, there are needy people out there, and I want them to have temporary help.\u201d To do that, the law needs to be changed \u201cso that the money goes to the truly needy.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s what the Trump administration\u2019s changes will help do. The proposed rule change is a reasonable step rooted in a principle that waste and fraud in the welfare system should be eliminated. That\u2019s a concept that enjoys popular support from more than 94% of Americans.\n\nEstimates suggest the change will lead to about 3.1 million individuals \u2013 nearly all with high levels of liquid assets \u2014 dropping off the food stamps program. That will leave 33 million Americans getting food stamps, nearly double the number 20 years ago, even though the labor market is stronger than it has been in decades.\n\nTo address the reasons behind these high figures, the administration and Congress will need to do more. Analysis by the Heritage Foundation has identified additional loopholes that allow states to avoid federal laws requiring work-capable beneficiaries to work as a condition of receiving benefits. That should change \u2013 because work is a critical path out of poverty.\n\nUltimately Congress will need to act to fully address the situation. But in the near term, the administration could make changes that could result in 4.5 million work capable people who get food stamps working or preparing to work.\n\nThat\u2019s reform that more than 90% of Americans agree with. It builds on the principle of providing assistance to the needy while also encouraging people to strive towards self-support, which the welfare system as a whole is failing to do today.", "description": "Today, millionaires can get food stamps, a safety-net welfare program intended to make sure lower-income people have the ability to access food.
