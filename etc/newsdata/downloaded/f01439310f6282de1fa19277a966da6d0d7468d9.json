I don\u2019t play a ton of Pok\u00e9mon, but I do enjoy the universe and I love learning more about the creatures in it. So, Here\u2019s Another Pok\u00e9mon! It\u2019s Munna!\n\nMunna Details\n\nType: Psychic\n\nAverage Height: 2'00\"\n\nAverage Weight: 23kg.\n\nFirst Added In Generation V\n\nA Pok\u00e9mon that can eat people\u2019s dreams is wild for a long list of reasons. I think the first thing that comes to my mind is how this creature even evolved into this form? I guess things work very differently in the Pok\u00e9mon universe. But I just don\u2019t see how useful it is for a wild animal to have this dream sucking ability. Then again, Munna is a giant pink ball that floats around. It was never going to be a top predator.\n\nWhat\u2019s really interesting about Munna is that it can actually suck up dreams AND nightmares. This could be extremely useful for people who suffer from frequent nightmares. Or it could be useful if you are one of those people who have bad nightmares after seeing a scary film. Just grab a Munna and stick it near your bed and tell it to watch for any signs of fear or alarm. If they see your body start to convulse or hear you scream out \u201cOh no! Pennywise please don\u2019t stick your wet finger in my ear!!\u201d the Munna can jump into action and suck the evil nightmare from your head.\n\nAfter eating up some dreams, according to Bulbapedia, Munna expels a mist that contains the dream. You can tell what kind of dream Munna has eaten based on the colour of the mist. Pink mist means a happy and sweet dream. It also means Munna just ate someone\u2019s happy dream and robbed that person of a wonderful day hanging out with their dead grandfather or something. Seems cruel.\n\nWait... Maybe my friend was being visited by a Munna every night and having his dreams erased?\n\nFavourite Fan Art\n\nMunna is pictured here expelling some nice and wonderful dream. It was probably a kid dreaming about his cat and how awesome it is to have superpowers. Nice going, Munna.\n\nRandom Facts\n\nAccording to a Pok\u00e9dex entry, Munna is related to Drowzee. The nose gives it away, honestly.\n\nAs far as I can tell, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any documented evidence of what colour the mist looks like when a nightmare is eaten. I might be wrong. I like to think it\u2019s pitch black mist.\n\nI wonder if other dream types have different colours? Maybe a really erotic dream is red and a boring dream is grey? Also, I\u2019m assuming some people in the Pokemon universe are selling vape rigs and flavours inspired by Munna\u2019s mist. \u201cYeah, dude. Try our new flavour \u2018Munna Tropical Mist.\u2019\u201d\n\nBest Comment From Last Week\n\nCotton balls have a million household uses, so good on you, Whimsicott. Game Freak should continue this trend with a baking soda Pok\u00e9mon, and a vinegar Pok\u00e9mon. And they breed to make the most useful Pok\u00e9mon ever. -LotionChowder\n\nA Pok\u00e9mon that leaves batteries around, but like those really weird sizes that nobody has in their house usually. Like watch batteries or triple-A batteries. I want a whole new type of Pok\u00e9mon called \u201cUseful.\u201d", "description": "Every Pokemon is interesting and worth talking about.
