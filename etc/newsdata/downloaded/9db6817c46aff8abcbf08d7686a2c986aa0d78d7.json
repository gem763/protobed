[Photo/VCG]\n\nThe internet has changed Chinese people's lives in many different ways since the country got access to the internet 25 years ago. One less well-known aspect of this change is career development for Chinese professionals.\n\nChen Lei is one example of this trend. He grasped opportunities brought by the internet and made a successful career transition in Hangzhou, East China's Zhejiang province.\n\nChen used to be a broadcaster, turned to the internet to create interactive TV content in July 2009.\n\nOver the past two years, he made efforts to add more interactive functions and attached a great deal of importance to community operation.\n\nBy cooperating with Alibaba's smart screen business department, Chen and his colleagues made it possible for customers to buy things while watching online video content.\n\nThese measures have boosted consumers' online spending, and the company where Chen works jumped from 6 million yuan ($0.85 million) to 16 million yuan in revenue over the past two years.\n\nChen is very grateful for the opportunity internet development has provided. He says he feels like a chef, making online content \"dishes\" for his customers.", "description": "Internet has changed people's lives in diversified aspects especially career development for Chinese professionals since the country got access to internet 25 years ago.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/22/5daeb1b2a310cf3e97a27411.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
