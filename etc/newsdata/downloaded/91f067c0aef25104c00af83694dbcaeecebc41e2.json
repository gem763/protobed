I feel, if we improve as a team, I\u2019ll be a success too.\u2019\n\nMaguire\u2019s enormous transfer fee has been touted as a possible reason for his slow start to life at his new club, but the giant defender has dismissed that idea.\n\n\u2018[The fee] doesn\u2019t bother me at all,\u2019 the centre-back told Inside United. \u2018It\u2019s something that I can\u2019t affect. Leicester wanted to keep me and they are in a great position as a club.\u2019\n\nThe Red Devils now have the international break to regroup before they host Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday 20 October, a match Solskjaer described as the \u2018perfect game\u2019 for his side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018That\u2019s a perfect game for us,\u2019 the Norwegian told the BBC after the Newcastle defeat. \u2018The international break is also at the perfect time because their heads need a bit of airing.\n\n\u2018They [Man Utd\u2019s players] will go away with their national teams, meet their team-mates and come back fresh.\n\n\u2018We have had a good time together, we have prepared since the first day of pre-season, we have stuck to the same principles.\u2019\n\n\u2018We are never happy when we don\u2019t win and we are going through a very difficult period.\u2019\n\nMaguire himself issued a rallying cry to his team-mates after the loss to the Magpies, tweeting: \u2018Not good enough, gutted. We must stick together.\u2019\n\nNot good enough, gutted.
