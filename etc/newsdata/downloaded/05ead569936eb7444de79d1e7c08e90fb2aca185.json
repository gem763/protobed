And if you're currently like, EXCUSE ME WHAT (understandable, I, too, am shook), here's a little background.\n\nThis weekend, Kylie attended the South Carolina wedding of Hailey Baldwin and Justin Bieber\u2014and while initial reports claimed Travis went with her, apparently she was at the event solo. And by that I mean she was there with a group of friends\u2014including Jaden.\n\nAnd here's the thing: Kylie and Jaden were seen dancing in a picture obtained by TMZ, and in said picture Jaden appears to be casually touching Kylie's butt. And now? Now Twitter is out here spiraling.\n\nSo is no one gonna talk about how Kylie and Jaden were dancing together yesterday and how he grabbed her butt... weren\u2019t they each other\u2019s first loves as teenagers up until Kylie started dating Tyga \ud83e\udd14 \u2014 Mar \u2661 (@breathinfenty) October 2, 2019\n\nDoes that explain why Jaden had his hands on kylies ass lmao https://t.co/aLtayr7a1E \u2014 \u0633\u0645\u064a\u0629 (@hailsvsce) October 2, 2019\n\nY\u2019all don\u2019t find it suspicious that first Kylie takes a pic with jaden smith HER EX!!!! AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN Travis and her break up!?!? Hmmmm \ud83e\udd14 pic.twitter.com/bgu8enBkVH \u2014 \ud83d\udd11\ud835\ude46\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud83e\udd76 (@chino_vuitton) October 2, 2019\n\nPlus, don't forget that Kylie and Jaden used to date in 2013 before she hooked up with Tyga\u2014and there were even reports that Jaden was the reason Kylie and Tyga split in 2015. \u201cKylie and Jaden have been hanging out lately and it made Tyga suspicious,\u201d a source told E! News. \u201cHe thought something might be going on. So that was one issue.\u201d\n\nHOWEVER, in their initial report about Kylie and Travis' breakup TMZ said this in regards to the Jaden butt-grabbing pic: \"we're told there's nothing to that\u2014they're just friends and have been for years.\"\n\nUh-huh. Kay. In other news, Travis has reportedly moved out of Kylie's home so that they can have some space from each other, but don't stress\u2014he's still seeing their daughter Stormi. \"Travis has been staying at his house in Beverly Hills and Kylie has been allowing him to see Stormi,\" a source told E! News. \"She would never take that away from him.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "What is even happening, help.", "authors": ["Mehera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vd.fdHENmTADwyUTwpROIg--~B/aD0yOTI7dz01ODQ7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/a4a344f68fb1e880721f4a4aef4647a9"}
