The 2-year note rate , sensitive to shifting expectations for Fed policy, finished the session where it left off on Wednesday at 1.742%, while the 30-year bond yield edged 0.1 basis point to 2.215%.\n\nYields fall as debt prices rise.\n\nWhat's driving Treasurys?\n\nU.S. government bond trading was listless on Thursday, as fixed-income traders attempted to assess Wednesday's interest rate cut, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaling less certainty about the rate path (link)than at the central bank's late-July meeting, saying it \"is going meeting by meeting.\"\n\nEconomic reports that proved better than expected data also may have kept rates somewhat in check.\n\nExisting-home sales rose (link) 1.3% in August from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million, the National Association of Realtors said, marking the strongest pace of sales since March of last year.\n\nAnd the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's manufacturing index (link) fell to 12.0 in September after registering a reading of 16.8 in August, but was above forecasts for a reading of 10 by economists polled by MarketWatch. Any reading above zero indicates improving conditions.\n\nTom di Galoma, managing director of Treasury trading at Seaport Global Holdings, said bond yields may be on hold now but politics abroad still remain a concern for U.S. Treasury markets.\n\n\"I believe [the move in the bond market] is a result of general geopolitical concerns, the fact that the Fed could resume easing again at some point this year, and the fact the market has stabilized from its 45 basis points reversal that took place over a very short period recently,\" he said, referring to matters ranging from conflict in the Middle East to wavering expectations for a China-U.S.-trade resolution. The 10-year Treasury note touched a recent low of 1.46% on Sept. 4.\n\nDonald Ellenberger, senior portfolio manager and head of multisector strategies at Federated Investors, said he expected the 10-year note to trade in a range between 1.50% and 1.85% until, perhaps the next U.S. monthly jobs report in early October. \"We could be in a period here for the next few weeks with no some consolidation,\" he said, noting that tweets or other surprises could upend that forecast.\n\nMeanwhile, in other central bank moves, the Bank of Japan held its interest rates steady, but signaled that it may cut rates at its Oct. 30-31 gathering. \"If I am asked if I feel more favorably about additional easing compared with the previous meeting, my answer is yes,\" said BOJ Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda at a news conference after the bank's policy meeting. \"There is no sign of recovery in overseas economies.\"\n\nIndeed, the Paris-based OECD underscored expectations for anemic economic growth across the world (link), citing trade clashes as amplifying a global slowdown. \"Escalating trade conflicts are taking an increasing toll on confidence and investment, adding to policy uncertainty, aggravating risks in financial markets and endangering already weak growth prospects world-wide,\" the OECD forecasts, released Thursday, said.\n\nElsewhere, the Swiss National Bank also made no changes to its current monetary-policy plans, the Bank of England unanimously voted (link)to hold interest rates at 0.75% and maintain its government purchases at GBP435 billion.\n\nHowever, Norway's central bank raised its interest rates by 25 basis points to 1.50% to the highest level in 5 years, while the Bank of Indonesia cut rates by a quarter-of-a-percentage point, as expected.\n\nTraders also focused on a gradual easing of anxieties in money markets after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York added $75 billion to the financial system, holding its third repurchase auction in as many days to relieve funding pressures. Banks asked for $83.875 billion in reserves, $8.875 billion more than the amount offered by the Fed, offering collateral in the form of Treasury and mortgage securities.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index index were seeing mixed action, with both off session highs.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 19, 2019 15:54 ET (19:54 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
