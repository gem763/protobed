Here are ten times when NBA stars and their coaches weren\u2019t afraid to get political:\n\n1 \u2013 LeBron James wearing a Beto hat prior to the 2018 election:\n\nLeBron James sporting a @BetoORourke hat in San Antonio tonight.

So therefore ain't no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up! \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) September 23, 2017\n\n4 \u2013 San Antonio Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich said it was time to take a fresh look at the 2nd Amendment:\n\n\u201cEven if they changed the age limit, it\u2019s all a Band-Aid,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cThe obvious elephant in the room is the guns, weapons of war, the magazines. The real discussion should be about the Second Amendment. Is it useful? Does it serve its purpose the way it was supposed to do in the beginning? That discussion should be had. \u201cIs one life more important than some congressman keeping his position because he\u2019s afraid he won\u2019t get funds from the NRA? It\u2019s a dereliction of duty on the part of everybody around (President) Trump.\u201d\n\n5 \u2013 Golden State Warriors Steve Kerr called people to vote in candidates who support gun control and took a shot at Trump\u2019s border wall:\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that people are being shot at a concert, at a movie theater. It\u2019s not enough, apparently, to move our leadership, our government, the people who are running this country to actually do anything and that\u2019s demoralizing,\u201d Kerr said. He added, \u201cWe can vote people in who actually have the courage to protect people\u2019s lives and not just bow down to the NRA because they\u2019ve financed their campaign for them\u2026Hopefully, we can find enough people with courage to actually help our citizens remain safe and focus on the real safety issues, not building some stupid wall for billions of dollars that has nothing to do with our safety.\u201d\n\nSteve Kerr\u2019s powerful message on the shooting massacre in Florida. pic.twitter.com/Lo4k66JG4G \u2014 Chris Haynes (@ChrisBHaynes) February 15, 2018\n\n6 \u2013 LeBron James, Derrick Rose and other players wear \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d shirts before a game\n\nLeBron James was the latest to sport an \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d shirt Monday night before the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 game. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Cavs thing,\u201d James said (via ESPN). \u201cIt\u2019s a worldly thing.\u201d Chicago Bulls guard Derrick Rose wore an \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d shirt on Saturday during warm-ups before Chicago\u2019s game and, on Monday night, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Garnett, Deron Williams, Jarrett Jack and Alan Anderson joined James, wearing the shirts before the Cavs-Nets game in Brooklyn. Outside the Barclays Center, about 200 protesters marched and chanted \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe!\u201d and \u201cNo justice! No peace! No racist police!\u201d\n\n7 \u2013 Coach Gregg Popovich gives a discourse on racism and white supremacy\n\n8 \u2013 Stephen Curry calls President Trump an ass\n\nUnder Armour CEO Kevin Plank, in an interview with CNBC, said President Donald Trump is an \u201casset\u201d to the country. \u201cI agree with that description,\u201d Curry said, \u201cif you remove the \u2018et\u2019\u201d from asset.\n\n9 \u2013 Four NBA players, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Dwyane Wade and LeBron James, issue a call to action for all professional athletes to get woke on issues like gun violence:\n\n10 \u2013 Indiana Pacers guard Victor Oladipo speaks at a rally for Indiana senator Joe Donnelly which also featured Joe Biden:\n\nWhat Oladipo was doing in Hammond was building a bridge between activism and the nitty-gritty world of campaigns. As I listened to his stump speech, I couldn\u2019t help but think about what it means when we call the NBA a \u201cpolitical\u201d league, and why more players don\u2019t follow Oladipo to the stump. At the end of his speech, Oladipo bent down toward the mic and in his best, thundering Biden impression, shouted, \u201cVote Donnelly!\u201d\n\nOf course, all of these players and coaches are entitled to their own opinions about political issues. They\u2019re also entitled to speak up about things they care about. Free speech is a right all Americans are entitled to use as they see fit. But that\u2019s not a right that people in China enjoy. Pro-democracy activist Wang Meiyu was arrested and beaten to death for holding a sign critical of President Xi Jinping. That\u2019s the kind of brutal future protesters in Hong Kong are bravely trying to avoid right now.\n\nAt the moment it looks a lot like these woke NBA stars are happy to shut up the moment political speech represents a threat to their bottom line (rather than a chance to posture for the cameras). If the players and coaches won\u2019t speak up when the league is eagerly kowtowing to the repressive government of communist China, we should keep that in mind the next time they want to lecture us about domestic politics.", "description": "\"It\u2019s a worldly thing.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Popovich.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
