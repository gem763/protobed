(Carteret County Detention Center)\n\nA North Carolina woman amputated her husband\u2019s penis Tuesday morning and was being held on $500,000 bond, according to authorities.\n\nJust before 4 a.m. Tuesday, Carteret County deputies arrived at the Newport home of Victoria Thomas Frabutt. Her husband, James, reported that his wife had tied him up, pulled out a knife and removed his penis, according to the incident report.\n\nWhen deputies recovered the 61-year-old\u2019s penis, it was quickly placed on ice and transported to medical personnel, according to the report.\n\nHis wife told a 911 operator that she used a pruner, \u201cgood for pruning roses,\u201d and that James\u2019s bleeding wasn\u2019t enough to create the \u201csign of the cross or write \u2018sinner,\u2019 \u201d according to WITN, which obtained the 911 call.\n\nThe arrest report stated that Frabutt\u2019s motive for amputating her husband\u2019s penis was unclear, but she told the 911 dispatcher the cause of her husband\u2019s pain was \u201cpart of the message against sinning against God and fornication,\u201d according to WITN.\n\nFrabutt, who was charged with kidnapping and malicious castration, made her first court appearance Wednesday with her head down and tears in her eyes.\n\nThe local news outlet reported that the 56-year-old was appointed a public defender, whose office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMedical professionals do not agree with the naming of the castration charge, but they do accede that there are options for someone who experiences the removal of the male part.\n\nRichard Redett, who performed the world\u2019s first penis and scrotum transplant last year, said castration involves only the removal of the testes.\n\nFrabutt\u2019s husband had a traumatic nonmedical amputation of his penis, said Redett, professor of plastic and reconstructive surgery at Johns Hopkins.\n\n[Veteran receives penis and scrotum transplant in surgery doctors say is a medical first]\n\nThe likelihood of bleeding out from a traumatic penis amputation is small because the arteries and vessels in the area aren\u2019t large enough to make that a possibility, according to experts.\n\nIf someone\u2019s penis is removed in a nonmedical environment, timing is critical.\n\n\u201cThe sooner you get it back on and reestablish blood supply, the better,\u201d Redett said, estimating that the maximum amount of time the organ could be off is between six and 12 hours.\n\nOnce an organ is not attached to the body, the cells begin to break down and die immediately. Recovery of penis function could be poorer based on the amount of cell and tissue damage that occurred before being reattached, he said.\n\nJay Sandlow, urologist with the Froedtert and the Medical College of Wisconsin Health Network, said he has seen cases of penis self-mutilation by patients with psychiatric disorders. Some patients are even able to get themselves to the hospital to seek help, he said.\n\nHow the penis is handled before the reattachment is also critical. Professionals placed Frabutt\u2019s husband\u2019s penis on ice, according to the incident report, but that might not have been the best option, Sandlow said.\n\n\u201cWrap the organ in saltwater-soaked gauze,\u201d he said, noting that saline keeps the tissue moist while the ice cools the organ down and slows the process of decomposition.\n\nAttacks like what authorities say happened to Frabutt\u2019s husband also increases a patient\u2019s risk of infection, which would have to be treated with antibiotics, he said.\n\nWhen reattaching the penis, doctors are concerned about how well the blood vessels and nerves can be hooked back up.\n\nIf the penis cannot be saved, there are still options.\n\nDoctors can perform a surgery that would close off what\u2019s remaining of the penis, or stump, said Charles Welliver, a trained urologist who specializes in men\u2019s health and a professor of surgery at Albany Medical College.\n\nA stump would still allow for a man to use the restroom, because there\u2019s still the capability of dispelling urine through the urethra opening. If the stump is too small, however, a patient could experience difficulty standing while urinating, Redett said.\n\nPatients also have the option of a phalloplasty, a procedure that involves doctors removing flaps of skin, often from the forearms or thighs, to help build a penis.\n\nA good reconstruction can allow for erogenous sensations to return along with urination, but complications are high and the procedure is complex, Redett said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be normal,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to lose some function.\u201d\n\nFrabutt\u2019s husband was being treated at Vidant Medical Center in Greenville, N.C., according to WITN. Frabutt\u2019s next court date is Sept. 20, according to WNCT.\n\nPeople mutilating their partner\u2019s body have made headlines before, with the Lorena Bobbitt case among the more notorious. Bobbitt cut off her husband\u2019s penis with a kitchen knife while he was asleep in their Manassas, Va., home in 1993 after enduring years of domestic violence and an alleged rape the night of her attack, Bobbitt told the New York Times. A jury found her not guilty based on a moment of temporary insanity.\n\nHer ex-husband had his penis reattached and went on to star in pornographic movies.\n\nMen can live without genitalia, as the penis and testes don\u2019t rely on each other to perform their different functions, Sandlow said.\n\n\u201cNeither one sounds really good to have cut off in a nonmedical way,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018Lorena\u2019 reveals how our culture\u2019s lurid responses to the Bobbitt case obscured reality\n\nThere\u2019s no one \u2018gay gene,\u2019 but genetics are linked to same-sex behavior, new study says\n\nFocusing on differences between the sexes is leading medical researchers astray", "description": "A North Carolina woman is facing criminal charges for allegedly cutting off her husband's penis.", "authors": ["Lateshia Beachum"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7DcHbY_BFTty1K7jfJ0m66AaSvI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XYBBTOENLFAAHJHGBQGZO37XOQ.jfif"}
