Then The Telegraph reported that Facebook Libra group head Simon Morris had left in August, confirmed by Morris' LinkedIn profile.\n\nLibra is intended to be a new digital currency that would work with online purchases and digital money transfers. It was conceived by Facebook, but the idea is that Libra will be led by a group of different firms via the non-profit Libra Association. The goal is a 2020 rollout.\n\nVisa, Mastercard, and Stripe are three of the 27 Libra Association members. Two Senate Democrats \u2013 Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii \u2013 have written a letter to the three payment processing firms, reportedly warning that Libra poses a risk to the global financial system.\n\nThe senators' letter appears to capitalize on a Wall Street Journal report which said both Visa and Mastercard were reconsidering their involvement with Libra. That report also said some Libra Association members were concerned about getting hold of details about how the organisation would be run and the risks of keeping the currency secure.\n\nRead more: Facebook denies there's 'angst' about its Libra cryptocurrency plans amid reports partners like Visa and Mastercard might pull out\n\nThe senators' letter reads, according to Bloomberg: \"We urge you to carefully consider how your companies will manage these risks before proceeding, given that Facebook has not yet demonstrated to Congress, financial regulators \u2014 and perhaps not even to your companies \u2014 that it is taking these risks seriously.\"\n\nPayPal has stopped its participation in the Libra Association (pictured is PayPal CEO Dan Schulman.) Getty\n\nFacebook itself has hit back at reports that it's failing to share detailed information with partners.\n\nStill, it's yet another roadblock in Libra's short history.\n\nThough the project was only announced in June, PayPal became the first firm to leave the Libra Association on Tuesday despite claiming it \"remains supportive of Libra's aspirations.\"\n\nAnd there's been a chorus of dissent from politicians around the world. In July, President Donald Trump tweeted that Libra will have \"little standing or dependability.\"\n\nDemocratic representative Rashida Tlaib has asked if the project aims to form a \"crypto mafia\" of mutually self-interested companies.\n\nThe European Union began a formal investigation of Libra over potential competition concerns in August, while the French finance minister Bruno le Maire said France \"cannot authorize\" Libra's development in Europe over consumer risk concerns. In the last 24 hours, Vodafone has reportedly called on the association to appoint an independent chief executive to separate it from Facebook.\n\nFacebook, the Libra Association, Mastercard, Visa and Stripe did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for comment.", "description": "Two Senate Democrats have reportedly written a letter to the 3 companies to warn them of Libra's risks.", "authors": ["Charlie Wood"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d43349f100a2405c82c53b0?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
