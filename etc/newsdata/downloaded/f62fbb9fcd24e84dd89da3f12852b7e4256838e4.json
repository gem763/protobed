I'd hope that if we're going to get congressional support it'll be in the next three to six months. And if we can't do that we'll move on the administrative front,\u201d he told Maria Bartiromo in an exclusive interview on \u201cMornings with Maria\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe think now is the time to recapitalize them, make them stronger and make sure that taxpayers aren't at risk and eventually raise third-party capital so that we restructure them and that in another housing downturn taxpayers are not at risk,\u201d he said.\n\nMnuchin said the first steps are negotiating with the Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA).\n\n\u201cWe expect in the near term we'll have an agreement where we will allow both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to retain their earnings which will be a significant increase in capital and a step in the right direction to us ultimately raising third-party capital,\u201d he explained.\n\nMnuchin said the other issue he \u201clooks forward\" to testifying about at the Senate on Tuesday will be bipartisan legislation to get approval to put a full faith in credit on the securities.\n\n\u201cWe think that the government should be paid for that wrap and we think there should be significant private capital in front of it \u2013 so something similar to the FDIC model or the Ginnie Mae [Government National Mortgage Association] wrap,\u201d he explained.\n\nCLICK HERE TO WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW WITH MNUCHIN\n\nTaking the two government-sponsored enterprises out from under government control could be a win for some investors, as companies could begin to turn a profit.\n\nWhen Bartiromo asked about the federal appeals court ruling in New Orleans that concluded the FHFA structure is unconstitutional and backed the government\u2019s rights to take all of the mortgage giants\u2019 profits, Mnuchin said, \u201cwe\u2019re not going to let this stand in the way of housing reform.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo as I say, there is an investor issue here which will continue to go through the legal process. But the most important issue is, regardless of that case, we will restructure Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac so that they have private capital in front of any taxpayer risk,\u201d he explained.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nBartiromo also asked: \u201cOne investor wants to know, given the ruling that the net worth sweep that we now know was illegal, is the September sweep going to be halted? Are we going to see money go back to the investors?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe money wouldn't go back to the investors, the money would stay in the companies and then obviously the legal process will go forward and obviously the Treasury has very significant claims for the money that we've outlaid,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut, you know, I expect we're\u2026 in the process of working with the FHFA and we're going to try to see if we can do it in September. If not, it'll be very soon after that.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles", "description": "Steven Mnuchin exclusive on Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac reform.", "authors": ["Julia Limitone"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
