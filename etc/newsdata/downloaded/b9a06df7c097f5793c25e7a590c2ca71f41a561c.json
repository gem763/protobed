The latter will have all-wheel drive as standard, by the way.\n\nI sampled the new M3\u2019s S58 engine in the new X3 and X4 M models, and trust me when I say it feels impressive in those packages.\n\nThe pair is powered by a 3.0-litre twin-turbo engine with 375kW and 600Nm. 0-100km/h is a claimed 4.1 seconds and top speed is 250km/h but can be unrestricted to 285km/h with the optional M Driver's Package.\n\nI only had a brief time with the duo on track but it\u2019s clear they have distinctive personalities. The X3 feels a bit more lively and dynamic in comparison to the X4\u2019s more Hulk approach of smashing through the lap. There's also a tad more body roll when cornering.\n\nImage: BMW / Rob Till\n\nBMW M CEO and President Markus Flasch says between 40-45% of M cars sold in the world are SUVs. This is also why the automaker showed media the new X5 M and X6 M Competition models at the event. These models are due in South Africa in 2020 and boast 460kW and 750Nm from a 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 engine.\n\nThe M340i xDrive and M135i xDrive were the only non-SUV models available to drive at the M Festival press day.\n\nImage: BMW / Rob Till\n\nThe former, ushers in a new \u2018entry\u2019 level performance option below the hardcore M3. Again a 3.0-litre twin-turbo engine does duty packing 275kW and 500Nm. The M340i will reach 100km/h from standstill in a claimed 4.4 seconds.\n\nOn track, the car felt punchy and glued to the surface with impressive high-speed cornering ability. Unfortunately, my limited laps didn\u2019t give me enough time to form an opinion, and a more lengthy test will provide detailed insight into this model.\n\nImage: BMW / Rob Till\n\nThe M135i is also fitted with all-wheel drive and utilises a 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine with 225kW and 450Nm.\n\nTo be fair, it didn't feel like there was 450Nm under my foot, but I can attest to it hauling itself off the line with little fanfare, it's like a stock trader that moonlights as a bouncer: suited up but capable of punching a hole in the wall.\n\nBack to what the public can look forward to, expect high-speed passenger rides in M cars around Kyalami, and a pop-up dealership with over 200 cars on display for sale.\n\nA particular highlight is the recently-restored 530 MLE, a car many BMW aficionados reckon is the genesis of ///M.\n\nClick on the link to buy tickets to the BMW M Festival here\n\nImage: BMW / Rob Till", "description": "The BMW M Festival kicks off this weekend in Johannesburg at the Kyalami racetrack, Wheels24's Sean Parker managed to sneak in a few days early to see what's in store.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9522/60df8105926c4d4793d88c8a9eea47d8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
