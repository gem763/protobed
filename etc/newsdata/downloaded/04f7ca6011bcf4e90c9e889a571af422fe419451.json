A second group of about 234,000 customers will lose power starting at noon, the utility said. The power outages are expected to affect about 2.5 million people.\n\nPG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late January after facing liabilities stemming from wildfires in Northern California that occurred over the past two years.\n\nThe utility plans to shut off power in parts of 34 northern, central and coastal California counties to reduce the chance of fierce winds knocking down or toppling trees into power lines during a siege of hot, dry, gusty weather.\n\nGusts of 35 mph to 45 mph (56-72 kph) were forecast to sweep a vast swath of the state, from the San Francisco Bay area to the agricultural Central Valley and especially in the Sierra Nevada foothills, where a November wildfire blamed on PG&E transmission lines killed 85 people and virtually incinerated the town of Paradise.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention said it increased staffing in preparation for extreme fire weather.\n\nThe winds will be the strongest and most widespread the region has seen in two years, and given the scope of the danger, there was no other choice but to stage the largest preventive blackout in state history, PG&E said.\n\n\"This is a last resort,\" said Sumeet Singh, head of the utility's Community Wildfire Safety Program.\n\nHowever, people should be outraged by the move, Gov. Gavin Newsom said. \"No one is satisfied with this, no one is happy with this,\" he said.\n\nThe utility needs to upgrade and fix its equipment so massive outages are not the norm going forward, he said.\n\nIt could take as many as five days to restore power after the danger has passed because every inch of power line must be checked to make sure it isn't damaged or in danger of sparking a blaze, PG&E said.\n\nThe news came as residents in the region's wine country north of San Francisco marked the two-year anniversary of deadly wildfires that killed 44 and destroyed thousands of homes. San Francisco is the only county in the nine-county Bay Area where power will not be affected.\n\nTo the south, Southern California Edison said more than 106,000 of its customers in parts of eight counties could face power cuts as early as Thursday as Santa Ana winds loomed.\n\nThe cutbacks followed a plan instituted after deadly wildfires \u2014 some blamed on downed PG&E transmission lines \u2014 destroyed dozens of lives and thousands of homes in recent years and forced the utility into bankruptcy over an estimated $30 billion in potential damages from lawsuits.\n\nThe outages Wednesday weren't limited to fire-prone areas because the utilities must turn off entire distribution and transmission lines to much wider areas to minimize the risk of wildfires.\n\nClasses were canceled for thousands of schoolchildren and at the University of California, Berkeley, Sonoma State University and Mills College.\n\nThe California Department of Transportation said it was installing generators to avoid closing the Caldecott Tunnel linking the East Bay to San Francisco and the Tom Lantos Tunnel on State Route 1 in Pacifica.\n\n\"The tunnels can't operate without power,\" the California Department of Transportation tweeted.\n\nPG&E had warned of the possibility of a widespread shut-off Monday, prompting residents to flock to stores for supplies as they prepared for dying cellphone batteries, automatic garage doors that won't work and lukewarm refrigerators.\n\nResidents of the Sonoma County city of Cloverdale, population 9,300, were preparing for the possibility of zero power and downed internet and cellphone lines, as happened during the wine country fires. Cloverdale homes were not burned then, but residents were worried sick over family in burn zones and in the dark without communications, Mayor Melanie Bagby said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nShe accused PG&E of failing to upgrade its equipment.\n\n\"It's inexcusable that we're in the situation that we're in,\" she said. \"We pay our bills, and we gave PG&E a monopoly to guarantee we would have\" reliable power.\n\nBut Santa Rosa Mayor Tom Schwedhelm said he was grateful PG&E was taking proactive action. His city lost 5% of its housing a 2017 fire that killed 22 and torched nearly 6,000 structures in Sonoma and Napa counties. State investigators determined the fire was sparked by a private electrical system, and was not the fault of PG&E.\n\nHospitals would operate on backup power, but other systems could see their generators fail after a few days. Outages even posed a threat that fire hydrants wouldn't work at a time of extreme fire danger.\n\nThe East Bay Municipal Utility District serving Alameda and Contra Costa counties, recently spent $409,000 to rent 29 backup generators for use beginning at noon Wednesday.\n\n\"The backup generators that we have are stationed at the pumping plants, which pump water to the fire hydrants,\" spokeswoman Andrea Pook told the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nCounties activated their emergency centers and authorities urged people to have supplies of water for several days, to keep sensitive medicines such as insulin in cool places, to drive carefully because traffic lights could be out, to have a full gas tank for emergencies and to check the food in freezers and refrigerators for spoilage after power is restored.\n\nPG&E set up about 30 community centers offering air conditioning, restrooms, bottled water and electronic charging stations during daylight hours.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nOakland Mayor Libby Schaaf asked residents Tuesday not to clog 911 lines with non-emergencies and urged people to be prepared. The city canceled all police officers' days off in preparation for the outages.\n\nPG&E said it was informing customers by text and email about where and when the power would be cut. But its website, where it directed people to check whether their addresses would be affected, was not working most of the day Tuesday after being overloaded with visitors.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The utility plans to shut off power in parts of 34 northern, central and coastal California counties to reduce the chance of fierce winds knocking down or toppling trees into power lines during a siege of hot, dry, gusty weather.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/11/0/0/PGE-FT.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
