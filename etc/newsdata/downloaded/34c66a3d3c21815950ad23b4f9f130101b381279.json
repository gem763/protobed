The military presence was part of a state of emergency declared by President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era in response to student-led protests Friday that paralyzed the city.\n\nProtesters burned several subway stations and damaged dozens of others, and some set fire to a high-rise energy company building. Officials reported 156 police officers and 11 civilians injured and more than 300 people arrested.\n\nThe conservative Pi\u00f1era vowed that those responsible for the violence \"are going to pay for their deeds.\"\n\nNew but less rowdy protests broke out again at midday Saturday in several areas around the metropolitan area, and police fired tear gas to break some of them up. Pot-banging and honking spread to cities to the country's north and south.\n\nDemonstrators build a burning barricade during a protest in Santiago, Chile, Saturday, October 19, 2019. The protests started on Friday afternoon when high school students flooded subway stations, jumping turnstiles, dodging fares and vandalizing stations as part of protests against a fare hike. Esteban Felix / AP\n\nThe government recently raised subway fares from about $1.12 to $1.16 due to rising fuel prices.\n\nThe head of the subway system, Louis De Granges, said the vandalism caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage and said it wasn't clear when service could resume. That means some 2.4 million people could have difficulties getting to work or school on Monday.\n\nChilean governments of left and right have been wary of bringing soldiers back into the streets since the end of a dictatorship during which thousands of suspected leftists were killed and dissent was ruthlessly crushed.\n\nThe state of emergency limits rights to free assembly and movement.", "description": "Protesters burned several subway stations and damaged dozens of others and some set fire to a high-rise energy company building", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/19/d421b913-988c-4fcb-878c-2bb699cfa8cd/thumbnail/1200x630/c2baa82890314c9bc7d6367b0f12bcdf/ap-19292725818574.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
