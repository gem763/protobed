I never dealt drugs.\n\n'I am now nearly 50 years old and was reflecting on a bad judgement call that could have turned worse. I say but for the grace of God, there go I.\n\n'It was part of an open and honest conversation about women, incarceration and mistakes made.\n\n'For legal reasons a portion of that segment was edited from the show. I hope my show can be a forum for sharing stories without shame or judgement - including a conversation we're having Friday on opioid addiction.'\n\nTamron Hall admitted to a 'bad situation' with her college boyfriend, telling her studio audience she used to 'facilitate selling' drugs\n\nHall, who returned to daytime television with her own ABC talk show last month, shocked her audience and the network with her revelation, which was cut out from the episode before airing. It is unclear in which context she made the revelation, but Tuesday's episode included a segment with former 'Dirty Jobs' host Mike Rowe (pictured)\n\nHall, who earned her degree in broadcast journalism from Temple University, made her return to daytime television with the premiere of her eponymous show last month.\n\nThe former Today show host left NBC in 2017 at the end of her contract and following the news of Megyn Kelly receiving her own hour with the morning show.\n\nAhead of her show's debut, she revealed to Good Housekeeping she made the decision to leave after realizing the network 'wanted something else' and it just wasn't her.\n\n'On the outside, it looked like it was all together. \"Look at her, she's walking out, her head up.\" My head is never going to be bowed, but I had to pray not to be broken,' Tamron told the publication about walking away from the job.\n\nWhen looking back on the moment, Tamron now realizes leaving the Today show has opened up new, and better, opportunities for herself.\n\n'I don't think I've ever said this out loud, but every 'no' that I received in my life, and there have been many, it's made sense at some point in time,' she said.\n\n'Even things I prayed to get and 'Oh my gosh, I want that job,' and I didn't get it, I look back and I say, 'Whew, thank goodness I didn't get that.''\n\nHall earned her degree in broadcast journalism at Temple University. She is pictured right representing her university on College Signing Day\n\nThe former Today show host left NBC in 2017 after her contract expired and following the news of Megyn Kelly receiving her own hour with the morning show\n\nHer show premiered on the same day as NBC's new talk show launch, which features Kelly Clarkson as the host. However Tamron insists that this scheduling does not make the two women competitors.\n\n'There's not a head to head,' she said. 'Anyone who would write, 'Oh there's a battle' is simply looking for a headline.\n\n'Kelly Clarkson will have a phenomenal show and I'm not just saying that, I'm saying that because I'm a fan of hers on American Idol, and she's a fun-loving person.'\n\nShe also recently became a mother to her son, Moses, after hiding the pregnancy from the public for months until finally revealing the bump In March \u2014 nearly two month before she gave birth.\n\nEven with a new job and motherhood taking up her time, Tamron stated it wasn't all she was as a person.\n\n'We are not the biggest job we've landed. We are not, even with motherhood, I love my son...[but] even he is not the total sum of my journey...I'm not Tamron from the Today show. I'm Tamron,' she said.\n\nTamron has established herself as having a life away from the cameras by keeping relatively private about her personal life.\n\nAdorable: This year has been a big one for Tamron, who gave birth to her son in April. Around the same time she also revealed she got married\n\nParents! When Tamron announced her pregnancy in March, less than two months before giving birth, she also revealed that she had secretly married her partner, Steve Greener\n\nThis was proven with her keeping the pregnancy hidden from the public for months, as it was a 'high-risk' pregnancy.\n\nBut when she quietly revealed her pregnancy in March, Tamron also informed the public she was married to her music executive husband, Steve Greener.\n\n'It's proof you can keep things private,' Tamron joked with the publication.\n\nShe faced backlash from the public on keeping the marriage and pregnancy a secret, but the talk show host insists it was to protect her relationships. Her husband also pushed for the privacy.\n\n'He wants my show to make it, but he wants our marriage to work and he knows part of that is maintaining this foundation, and him being comfortable with who he is and not pushed into someone he isn't,' Tamron told Good Housekeeping.\n\nShe continued: 'We're an interracial couple, we're both older parents, he's from the Bronx, I'm from Texas, that alone is a divide.\n\n'We knew we wanted to prepare ourselves for what this exciting journey would bring.'\n\nDue to her age and the high-risk pregnancy, Tamron decided to keep her future son a secret from the public until she was ready.\n\n'I said to my doctor, 'How much do I tell?' and he said, 'You don't owe anybody your story.' And I said, 'Cancer survivors tell their stories,' and he said, 'That's a choice,'' Tamron said.", "description": "ABC producers were left scrambling to edit Tamron Hall's talk show after she confessed to viewers she used to 'facilitate' selling cocaine when she was a teenager, DailyMail.com can reveal.", "authors": ["Karen Ruiz For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/21/19856178-0-image-a-20_1571343950993.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
