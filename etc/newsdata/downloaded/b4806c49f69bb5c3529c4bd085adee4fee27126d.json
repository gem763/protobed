Specifically, beginning in 2021, employees in Massachusetts will be eligible for:\n\n\u2022 Up to 12 weeks: to care for new child or if a family member is involved in a military deployment\n\n\u2022 Up to 12 weeks: to care for a family member with a serious medical condition\n\n\u2022 Up to 20 weeks: to replace earnings when a medical condition prevents work.\n\n\u2022 Up to 26 weeks: to care for a military family member with a serious medical condition.\n\nThe payment is equal to:\n\n\u2022 80% of earnings equal to or less than 50% of the state average weekly wage; and\n\n\u2022 50% of earnings in excess of 50% of the state average weekly wage.\n\nThe maximum weekly benefit is $850 a week. This amount will be adjusted each year to keep pace with 64% of the state average weekly wage.\n\nThe program is financed by a payroll tax. That tax is split between a levy for family leave and for medical leave (see figure below). An employer with 25+ employees can have the employee pay 100% of the family leave amount and up to 40% of the medical leave amount. Thus, employees could pay as much as half the total tax (0.248 + 0.13= 0.378) and employers the other half. For businesses with fewer than 25 people, employers don\u2019t have to contribute to the state fund at all, although their employees will still contribute. Any employer can request an exemption if they offer family or medical leave as generous as that provided under the new law, in which case neither the employer nor its employees pay the tax.\n\nThis law has caused me a lot consternation.\n\nFirst, it has taken me by surprise. I fancy that I usually know what\u2019s going on \u2014 at least in my own state. Second, I support the goal of the legislation that makes it easier for people \u2014 particularly women \u2014 to both work and take care of family. Third, I sniffed at alternative ways to pay for family and medical leave. For example, senators Rubio and Romney proposed allowing people to draw on future Social Security benefits to cover family needs when they are young. Fourth, I never considered the possibility that states would start using the Social Security payroll tax base for their programs. In fact, at this time, seven other states (California, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington) have some form of family and medical leave program and they are all funded by a tax on payrolls.\n\nSo where do I come out? Progress is good. This legislation will definitely improve the quality of life for Massachusetts workers. At the same time, we do risk burdening workers if all social programs are funded by a regressive payroll tax. Thus, it seems even more important than ever to identify the costs of Social Security that should be borne by today\u2019s workers and the portion attributable to giving away the trust fund to early generations that should be borne by taxpayers more generally.", "description": "While a desirable goal, financing amounts to 25% of money needed to fix Social Security", "authors": ["Alicia H.
