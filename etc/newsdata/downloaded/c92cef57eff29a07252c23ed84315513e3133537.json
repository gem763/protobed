But I think that's what's really important. You can't have a conversation about women's empowerment with just women.\"\n\nAccording to royal correspondent, Richard Palmer, the duchess closed by adding, \"Thank you for letting him (Harry) crash the party.\n\n\u201cThank you for letting him crash the party,\u201d says Meghan. pic.twitter.com/v2JyMD6biT \u2014 Richard Palmer (@RoyalReporter) October 25, 2019\n\n(Photo: Instagram/sussexroyal)", "description": "Duchess Meghan says the discussion around gender equality cannot happen without men as she attends a round table talk at Windsor Castle.", "authors": ["Bashiera Parker", "Bparks_"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7983/e628e2595b5f4185b0d4b493e354dc61.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
