SB 206 (also known as the Fair Pay to Play Act) would permit collegiate athletes in the state, which include schools like USC, UCLA, UC Berkeley and Stanford, to seek payment for use of their name, image or likeness.\n\nThe NCAA, the governing body for college sports in America, has long prohibited its student-athletes from earning any semblance of profit associated with their skill set or name cache. Meanwhile college sports are a $14bn industry, and the NCAA reported a staggering $1.1bn in revenue generated last year, thanks in large part to the unpaid labor of its athletes.\n\nThe Rich Paul Rule is proof the NCAA knows its days are numbered | Etan Thomas Read more\n\nThe California state assembly this week voted unanimously in favor of the bill. It is expected to overwhelmingly pass in the California state senate soon, and then will land on the desk of California governor Gavin Newsom, who will have 30 days to sign or veto the bill.\n\nFair Pay to Play does not require schools to alter their methods of recruiting or increase their scholarships minimums. It simply allows athletes to earn spending money in a multitude of currently prohibited ways, such as selling their memorabilia, signing endorsement deals or even offering private lessons.\n\nThe stark disparity in income between the players and those in the NCAA\u2019s web of wealth has long been part of the national conversation, and the intensity has heightened with the possibility of SB 206 becoming reality.\n\nAs James tweeted to his 43.6m followers, \u201cEveryone is California- call your politicians and tell them to support SB 206! This law is a GAME CHANGER. College athletes can responsibly get paid for what they do and the billions they create.\u201d\n\nWith the bill\u2019s fate on the brink, NCAA president Mark Emmert wrote a fiery letter to Newsom on Wednesday demanding he veto. Emmert called the act \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and threatened to boot California schools from NCAA competition, citing an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d.\n\nThe bill\u2019s co-author, state senator Nancy Skinner fired back at Emmert, calling his bluff and noting that the NCAA has lost many anti-trust decisions in the past.\n\nUnderstanding the battle between the players, who many consider \u201cindentured servants,\u201d the deep-moneyed NCAA, and the college sports purists who strongly believe in the amateur-professional divide requires a deeper examination of this contentious landscape.\n\nBleak picture for student-athletes\n\nLate 2011 was the final straw for Tim Nevius. The then-NCAA investigator had been the lead investigator in the Ohio State tattoo \u201cscandal\u201d, in which several star players, including quarterback Terrelle Pryor, were suspended for five games for selling memorabilia in exchange for free and discounted tattoos. The intensity of the media coverage and the punishment, it all seemed so blown of out proportion to Nevius.\n\n\u201cThere was an element of discomfort as I worked on more and more cases and seeing what the universities were making off the talents of those young people and their inability to capitalize on their own skill,\u201d Nevius says.\n\nA year later he visited Jermil Martin, a former Ohio State running back who transferred after he was punished for exchanging memorabilia for a discount on a Chevy Tahoe. Martin never graduated college and was trying to get by in a rough neighborhood outside of Columbus, his dreams of earning a top education and launching a successful football career out of reach. Martin had tears in his eyes as he described being taken advantage of and how his life fell apart simply because of a discounted vehicle.\n\nNevius couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He left the NCAA and soon thereafter founded Nevius Legal, a company that helps college athletes navigate the NCAA\u2019s 400-page ever-changing rule book and all aspects of compliance. He more recently launched the College Athlete Advocacy Initiative, which lobbies for institutional reform. CAAI recently released a searing ad spotlighting the plight of the student athlete which for many is darker than it seems.\n\nWhen a school grants a player a scholarship they are essentially trading employment for a free (or reduced cost) education. Thanks to a 2015 victorious federal lawsuit by former UCLA basketball star Ed O\u2019Bannon against the NCAA, athletes on full scholarship are also eligible for a cost-of-living stipend, though it is often just enough for the basics. The athlete must operate under a litany of complex rules without the assistance of an agent or a union. Heavy fines, stripped eligibility and other punishments are only a minor misstep away.\n\nThe NCAA touts the value of a free education. For some this is true. You will hear about players like Andrew Luck, who earned an engineering degree from Stanford, or other payers who would thrive with or without football. But for many, especially the African Americans who live below the poverty line and make up a significant portion of basketball and football rosters in elite conferences, the reality is more grim.\n\nAccording to 2018 report from USC\u2019s Race and Equity Center, just 55% of black athletes from the Power Five conferences, which includecollege sports\u2019 most profitable programs, graduate in six years as compared to 69.3% of all student-athletes.\n\nNevius says that many of those graduates are left with hollow futures. \u201cEverything is designed around the university and coach\u2019s priority of sports first so they\u2019re clustered into these majors that may not align with their academic interest and oftentimes do not give them the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in life beyond sports,\u201d he says.\n\nAccording to the NCAA, fewer than 2% of college athletes go on to play professional sports.\n\nThe NCAA is drowning in money\n\nIn any organization that generates billions, top employees will pocket significant salaries. But in the NCAA, the figures are astronomical. Alabama football coach Nick Saban will make $8.3m this year. Kansas basketball coach Bill Self will make $7.9m. Emmert will take home $2.4m. In fact, the highest-paid state employee in 39 of the 50 states is a college football or basketball coach. These coaches can earn additional money from radio appearances, endorsement deals and, really, in any way they choose.\n\nMuch of the NCAA\u2019s revenue comes from television contracts. Its March Madness rights packages with CBS and Turner Sports bring in $800m in revenue alone. Passage of SB 206 would not make a dent in televisions contract figures or any aspect of the NCAA\u2019s nonstop flow of cash. It would simply afford athletes the chance to profit off their sliver of time as an expert in their field. As Skinner has pointed out, this is especially true for female athletes who have virtually no options in the professional sports market.\n\nThe NCAA asserts that amateurism protects a number of potential pitfalls, ranging from an uneven playing field to players living off campus to a reduced focus on academics. The swelling number of dissenters say these notions are baseless, an example of fear-mongering and an attempt for the NCAA maintain control of an antiquated system.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nIf SB 206 is signed into law, the NCAA could ban California schools from competing in its association as Emmert threatens. But taking that route would cost the NCAA significant amounts of revenue and an ungodly legal bill as this battle would likely head to the courts. It would also, as Emmert suggests, give California schools an advantage in recruiting even if they had to form some kind of independent league. Given this reality, passage of the bill could eventually force the NCAA to follow suit.\n\nThe more symbiotic move would be for the NCAA to work with lawmakers and enact the bill (or a similar version) across schools nationwide. There are the purists who want to protect the sanctity of amateurism yet each new bill and lawsuit is an inch closer to the inevitable.\n\nWhile passage of SB 206 would barrel away from amateurism in its purist form, there is a still a massive disparity between what a college athlete would make selling a jersey or offering hitting lessons vs. a professional athlete salary. Yet the ability to make some semblance of money might keep some elite athletes from declaring early, which would in turn generate even more revenue for the member school and the NCAA.\n\nPassage of SB 206 seems rational on several fronts, but Nevius doesn\u2019t see the multi-billion dollar entity that is the NCAA acquiescing without a continued fight.\n\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s so wasteful and tone deaf. This is the way things are going and it\u2019s widely recognized as the fair and right thing to do but the NCAA in the interest of money and control refuses to allow to this happen as it should. It\u2019s beyond disappointing, it\u2019s disgusting.\u201d", "description": "California\u2019s governor is on the verge of signing the Fair Pay to Play Act, which could forever upend the balance of power in college sports.
