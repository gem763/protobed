The EU wants plenty of time to plan its approach ahead of a crucial European Council summit on October 17-18.\n\nFor his part, Johnson told the French president the EU should not be lured into believing the UK would stay in the bloc after October 31.\n\nHe and his supporters continue to repeat the message that there will be no new Brexit delay at the end of the month \u2013 even though the British parliament has legislated effectively obliging the prime minister to seek another extension if no deal is agreed with the EU.\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Saturday that on the basis of his mandate from the EU27, he did not believe progress could be made unless the British changed their position.\n\nA no-deal Brexit \u201cwould always be the UK\u2019s choice, not ours,\u201d he said, in what some are taking to be the beginning of a blame game. The British government has accused the EU of lacking flexibility.\n\nRead more: Why is Boris Johnson's latest Brexit plan a headache for the EU?\n\nEuropean leaders have responded coolly to the UK\u2019s proposals, which would see Northern Ireland leave the customs union along with the rest of the UK, but remain in the single market for goods.\n\nThe European Commission said on Friday that the British plan submitted last week did not provide the basis for reaching an agreement.\n\nBoris Johnson has acknowledged that customs checks will be inevitable on the island of Ireland, which the Irish government \u2013 backed by the EU \u2013 wants to avoid. The British say these could be largely automated, and take place away from the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. The EU believes the risk of a hard border is too great.\n\nBrussels insists any alternative plan to the backstop must be equally credible and legally enforceable. The UK wants to ditch the EU\u2019s insurance measure as contained in the negotiated withdrawal agreement, which would keep the UK in a customs union with the EU should no alternative solution be found.\n\nThe prime minister has claimed that his plan would have the support of parliament, which rejected the existing exit deal three times. This has led to more criticism that the UK is once again negotiating with itself rather than with the EU.\n\nRead more:\n\nJohnson 'will ask' EU for Brexit extension if no deal agreed\n\nUK Brexit adviser Shanker Singham: 'EU must compromise'\n\nBrexit Guide: Where are we now?", "description": "Boris Johnson launches another diplomatic offensive to win over EU sceptics to the UK's Brexit plan, with time running out to secure a deal.", "authors": ["Alasdair Sandford"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/21/38/80/1000x563_cmsv2_314c8da4-d0c7-5c84-be1d-bad2e84fffe2-4213880.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
