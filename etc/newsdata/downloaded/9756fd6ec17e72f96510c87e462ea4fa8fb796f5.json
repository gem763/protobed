Josh Pieters / YouTube\n\nPieters and his friend, magician Archie Manners, decided to call their fake restaurant \"The Italian Stallion\" and set up a website, featuring a picture of reality star Gemma Collins as their \"head chef.\" They also gathered together all the relevant paperwork and set up a company, \"Italian Stallion Ltd.\"\n\nArmed with some social media accounts and a list of recipes born from Waitrose ready meal packets, the duo were ready to see if their plan was going to work.\n\nIt almost seemed too easy. Pieters called Deliveroo to say he was still waiting for a hygiene inspection, to which he was told the restaurant could still operate on the app.\n\n\"We were never sure if we were going to get listed or not, because we were speaking to them and they did keep mentioning a food hygiene rating,\" he told Insider. \"Then one day on the phone they said you can start so long as you notify the council, and then they will assign a hygiene rating to your premises.\"\n\nThe pair even tried to tip off Deliveroo that the restaurant wasn't real by hiding an AirPod in one of the food pictures, but it didn't work.\n\n\"So, despite having a picture of Gemma Collins and an AirPod as feta cheese, and no food hygiene inspection of any kind, Deliveroo were happy for us to get going,\" Pieters said.\n\nRead more: A YouTuber tricked influencers into thinking they'd been sent pieces of the moon, but it was actually just gravel\n\nIn the video, Pieters asked his friend to order a dish from \"The Italian Stallion\" to test whether their Deliveroo device worked. It came through successfully, but Manners accidentally clicked accept, meaning they had to rush out to buy a chili prawn pasta meal from Waitrose and microwave it before a Deliveroo driver showed up ... to deliver the meal back to where it came from.\n\nTest complete, \"The Italian Stallion\" opened up to the public. Thanks to adding a big discount to their prices, the orders started flooding in.\n\n\"Once we were live I didn't think we would get any orders because we didn't have any ratings or anything,\" said Pieters. \"But as soon as we made our restaurant 40% off, we got loads, I guess because it was cheap food.\"\n\nPieters decided to add an envelope inside delivery bags with a note explaining the joke and the cost of what the customer had paid in cash, to make sure they weren't actually scamming anyone.\n\n\"The public loved Italian Stallion!\" Pieters said in the video's narration as he and Manners rushed and struggled to get together all the microwave meals people were ordering. In the end they decided to send the meals down to the delivery drivers via a bucket on a rope to save some time.\n\nPieters asked Manners how much money they made to which he responded \"over \u00a3100,\" although they did give all of it back.\n\n\"I think we've established that you can put the microwave in your kitchen on Deliveroo,\" said Pieters, before he decided one night of \"The Italian Stallion\" was quite enough, and set the restaurant on Deliveroo as \"officially closed.\"\n\n\"From what I heard people enjoyed the food and it tasted good,\" he told Insider. \"So maybe I could switch careers and set up a restaurant in my kitchen ... But 'The Italian Stallion' is lying dormant for now.\"\n\nRead more: A woman who thought she was 'too good-looking to find love' says a relationship expert showed her the 4 important mistakes she was making\n\nIn a previous video, Pieters tricked several influencers into thinking they'd received pieces of the moon from the National Space Centre. One of his other recent videos shows him and Manners buying quails eggs from the supermarket in the hope of one of them hatching \u2014 and it does.\n\nHe told Insider he likes to put a lot of effort into his videos because sometimes it pays off.\n\n\"I like to make stuff that I can show my mates and my parents and they'd actually find it interesting,\" he said. \"It's definitely that angle of 'is that possible? Let's test it out and see if it works.'\"\n\nYou can watch the full video below.\n\nInsider has reached out to Deliveroo for comment.\n\nRead more: From PewDiePie to Shane Dawson, these are the 25 most popular YouTube stars in the world", "description": "Josh Pieters, a YouTuber with nearly a million subscribers, wondered whether Deliveroo would allow him to set up a fake restaurant.", "authors": ["Lindsay Dodgson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7637e821214c798402f075-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
