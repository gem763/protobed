Nobody tells me that it\u2019s playful or mischievous \u2013 it is utterly uninspired, devoid of imagination, seduction, charge or excitement. It\u2019s just romantic consumerism.\n\n\u2018And when people do go on a date, it\u2019s like a job interview,\u2019 she continues, in her gloriously rich, buttery European accent. \u2018I am continuously giving advice about what a first date should look like \u2013 people have forgotten how to go on a first date.\u2019\n\nIf anyone can teach us the art of dating properly again, it\u2019s Esther. The 60-year-old Belgian-born psychotherapist is easily the most prominent relationship expert of our age, with bestselling books, two TED Talks (29 million views and counting) and a phenomenally popular podcast, Where Should We Begin?, behind her. Now a bona-fide celebrity, she is known worldwide for her ability to solve almost any relationship or sex dilemma \u2013 and to tell us where we\u2019re going wrong when it comes to dating.\n\nPart of the problem, she continues, is that we have waylaid the ancient arts of seduction and flirting. \u2018I go up in the elevator, 22 floors, to my office every day, and I look around and think, my God, this elevator used to be such a prime place to chat, to meet, to seduce, to say: \u201cWhat floor do you work on? Can I bring you a coffee?\u201d\u2019 she sighs. \u2018And people on aeroplanes used to talk to each other. Spending six hours talking to someone that you\u2019ll never see again used to be one of my great pleasures. Now, they stick you in a pod [we clearly fly different classes], and everyone puts their headphones on. A certain kind of desocialisation is taking place that is making it harder for people to be spontaneous, to improvise, or to even have face-to-face conversations.\u2019", "description": "\u2018Tinder won\u2019t last,\u2019 declares Esther Perel with disdain, forking asparagus dusted with Parmesan into her mouth.", "authors": ["Jane Mulkerrins", "Bryony Gordon", "Judith Woods", "Dame Moya Greene Dbe", "Stephanie Baxter", "Rosa Silverman", "Allison Pearson"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/women/2019/10/04/Stella_EstherPerel_091819_109790-1-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrIO3KFpHhCkkFEvhdkwyTnZe4Y_6h61OUWhPPHJ3oDE.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
