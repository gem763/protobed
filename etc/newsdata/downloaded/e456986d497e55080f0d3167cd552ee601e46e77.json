When the DNC reached out and reported the furry dogpile to Beto\u2019s campaign, the DNC staffer noted, \u201cI haven\u2019t flagged this activity to Twitter as I think the backlash to any action taken by them might be worse than the current activity.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the dogpile, the DNC reported after the September debate \u201c[a]t least three new right-wing narratives targeting candidates,\u201d and that there was a \u201cdirect threat to one candidate, which Twitter removed in the early morning following the debate.\u201d\n\nThe O\u2019Rourke campaign recently faced a false story more concerning to them than the (mostly) harmless furry meme. Last month, a story spread online that the Odessa shooter, who killed seven people, had a Beto sticker on his car. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect kind of misinfo because it seems possible,\u201d said Rob Flaherty, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s digital director. \u201cIt would undercut the whole narrative. If it were a reporter, we could just call them and they would issue a correction.\u201d", "description": "And you thought the DNC was funny BEFORE.", "authors": ["Sam Janney", "Posted At Pm On October", "Sam J."], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lol.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
