Each side shook their heads at the other.\n\nThe bill at the center of the hearing would amend existing city laws to eliminate criminal penalties for selling or buying sex in the District. If passed, it would make the District the only U.S. jurisdiction to legalize prostitution, outside of some areas of Nevada where legal brothels exist.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nProstitution involving minors and coercing others to engage in sex work against their will would remain illegal.\n\nThursday\u2019s hearing was the first time the community could comment on the legislation, introduced in June by council members David Grosso (I-At Large), Anita Bonds (D-At Large), Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1) and Trayon White Sr. (D-Ward 8). Public comments are open online through Nov. 1.\n\nProponents of the legislation \u2014 sex workers, LGBTQ rights groups and public health organizations among them \u2014 said the bill would empower sex workers and would make it easier for them to find housing and, eventually, to leave the industry, as they would not have prostitution-related arrests on their records.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe decriminalization of sex work would make sex workers safer by allowing them to report violence without fear of arrest,\u201d said Tyrone Hanley, senior policy counsel with the National Center for Lesbian Rights.\n\nAD\n\nThose who oppose it \u2014 a coalition of anti-trafficking advocates, sex-trafficking survivors, religious leaders and concerned citizens \u2014 argued that decriminalizing payment for sex would embolden pimps, traffickers and others who coerce and force people to sell their bodies. They told legislators it would turn the nation\u2019s capital into a red-light district and send the message that residents are for sale.\n\nThings got tense between Councilman Grosso, who wrote the bill, and @Courtneyshouse founder, Tina Frundt, who said she was not \u201cinvited to the table\u201d to discuss solutions for sex-trafficking survivors as part of the effort to decriminalize sex work in #DC. pic.twitter.com/HDVGW801US \u2014 Marissa J. Lang (@Marissa_Jae) October 17, 2019\n\n\u201cResidents of the District of Columbia should not be subjected to a social science experiment that we already know the consequences of,\u201d said LaRuby May, an attorney and a former D.C. Council member. \u201cThis legislation will create more victims and subject our residents to more trauma.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJudith Sandalow, executive director of the Children\u2019s Law Center, said if the District were to legalize sex work, some people who stay away from prostitution because it is illegal would choose to buy sex. She estimated the city would see a 20 percent jump in the number of people willing pay for sex.\n\nAD\n\nIt was a statistic repeated multiple times throughout the day.\n\nWhile sex workers said the increased demand would allow them to negotiate higher rates and make more money, opponents said it would lead to increased trafficking as unwilling women and girls would be used to satisfy paying customers.\n\n\u201cBecause this demand cannot be met locally, traffickers will bring prostituted women and girls from other jurisdictions,\u201d said Toni Van Pelt, president of the National Organization for Women, which opposes the bill. \u201cD.C., the capital of our nation, would undoubtedly become a sex tourism destination.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDespite their disagreements, few in the crowd believed the existing law should stay as is.\n\n\u201cThere is not a soul in this room who is in favor of trafficking,\u201d Allen said. \u201cEvery single person here wants to do what we can to make sure individuals are not trafficked.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMany of those opposed to the legislation noted that they would support an effort to partially decriminalize sex work by making it legal to sell \u2014 but not buy \u2014 sex. Doing so, they said, would ensure the safety of sex workers, allow them to leave the trade and secure homes and jobs without the scourge of prostitution-related arrest records. It would also, advocates said, continue to discourage buyers from seeking it out.\n\nAD\n\nAdvocates of the legislation said partial decriminalization, known as the Nordic model, does not work.\n\n\u201cUnder the Nordic model . . . people still feel unsafe, and when people feel unsafe, they take less time to negotiate for safety, or for their health,\u201d said Cyndee Clay, executive director of D.C. sex-worker advocacy group HIPS.\n\nWomen sat before lawmakers for hours and recounted their experiences as sex workers.\n\nAD\n\nCouncil members play audio testimony from human-trafficking survivors at @Courtneyshouse who are urging #DC lawmakers to invest in social services, expunge prostitution records and implement other partial-decrim policies instead of full sex-work decriminalization.

Lang (@Marissa_Jae) October 17, 2019\n\nFor some, it was a way out of poverty, a means to take care of their families and children, a job they felt they took by choice. For others, it was a nightmarish life of fear and abuse.\n\n\u201cSex workers came together and said, \u2018This is what we need,\u2019 knowing there is a partial-decrim model,\u201d said Tamika Spellman, policy and advocacy associate at HIPS. \u201cI am for total decriminalization and total decrim only.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe bill would create a task force to study the effects of decriminalization and make additional recommendations, which could include regulations for health and safety. More than 170 people signed up to testify at the hearing, which continued into the evening.\n\nGrosso\u2019s decriminalization effort failed in 2017, but he said he is more optimistic now, with several fellow council members signing on as co-sponsors. Committee members will vote on the legislation \u2014 and whether to pass it to the full council \u2014 next month.\n\nAD\n\nSome speakers Thursday criticized the bill for not having more robust solutions for helping people leave the sex trade.\n\n\u201cTo separate prostitution from human trafficking is impossible,\u201d said Janet Rodriguez, a human-trafficking survivor who said she was forced to sell sex in Mexico and in the District. \u201cIf you pass this law . . . you will all have blood on your hands.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTina Frundt, a survivor of sex trafficking who founded Courtney\u2019s House, an organization in the District that helps young people escape their traffickers, berated Grosso for not including the perspectives of sex-trafficking survivors in the crafting of the bill.\n\nDuring her testimony, she played audio recordings of sex-trafficking survivors and teenage girls who said such a law would make them feel less safe in the city.\n\nOn one side, rows of people wore orange stickers that read, \u201cProtect survivors, not buyers.\u201d On the other side, activists wore white shirts that said, \u201cSex workers deserve housing, not handcuffs.\u201d As the voices of children filled the meeting room, people on both sides listened in silence, eyes downcast, taking in the girls\u2019 message word by word.\n\nAD", "description": "The legislation would make the District the first city in the nation to take such action.", "authors": ["Marissa J.
