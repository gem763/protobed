They were cast as Horror and Lardy in the pose of Laurel and Hardy, complete with bowler hats.\n\nIn 2016, 17.4 million voters, or 52%, backed Brexit while 16.1 million, or 48%, backed staying in the EU. Both campaigns were supported by wealthy backers.\n\nSex, of course, was one topic employed on Saturday, as peculiarly, were vegetables and fruit.\n\n\"Brexit is like consent - we can change our minds during foreplay,\" read one placard. \"Pulling out never works,\" read another.\n\nOne man was dressed as broccoli while another was dressed as a banana with a sign: \"We are ripe for change.\"", "description": "British protesters lampoon the 'Lucifer' of Brexit and his billionaire backers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9I0BG_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
