(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nDuring his first address to the United Nations, in 2009, former President Barack Obama warned that \u201cno nation, however large or small, wealthy or poor, can escape the impact of climate change.\u201d He told the General Assembly that \u201crising sea levels threaten every coastline\u201d and \u201con shrinking islands, families are already being forced to flee their homes as climate refugees.\u201d\n\nHowever, given the former first couple\u2019s impending purchase of a $14.8 million mansion on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, the Obamas appear to be either impervious to the effects of climate change or guilty of exaggerating its dangers.\n\nAccording to Forbes, the nearly 7,000-square-foot estate sits on 29 acres with a driveway roughly a third of a mile long. The sprawling home has seven bedrooms, 8.5 bathrooms, a pool surrounded by a garden and access to private beaches.\n\nThe Obamas have been renting the property since August, and are in the process of buying it from Boston Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the former president purchasing a large home, of course. Why, even the socialist firebrand Bernie Sanders has three properties of his own. But the optics of Mr. Obama residing in an enormous island home seem hypocritical, at best. After all, he did spend eight years lecturing the American people about the importance of minimizing their carbon footprints and the looming crisis of eroding shorelines.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Obama once famously said that at \u201ca certain point, you\u2019ve made enough money.\u201d Apparently, he and Michelle haven\u2019t reached that point. Between speaking fees, book contracts and their Netflix deal, the couple\u2019s net worth is roughly $40 million, according to Business Insider. Good to know they still have room to work with before they begin to voluntarily turn over their assets to federal or state bureaucrats.\n\nIf comfortable members of the progressive gentry set don\u2019t take global warming seriously, why should anyone else?\n\nOh, and those \u201cshrinking islands\u201d Mr. Obama was so worried about? Turns out the notion of rising seas swallowing up island nations is actually more climate alarmism designed to erode opposition to a massive government takeover of the American economy. Studies reveal that many of the \u201cendangered\u201d reef islands in the Pacific and Indian oceans have actually increased in land mass in recent years.\n\n\u201cThe implication,\u201d National Geographic reported in 2015, \u201cis that many islands \u2014 especially less developed ones with few permanent structures \u2014 may cope with rising seas well into the next century.\u201d\n\nAnd that includes Martha\u2019s Vineyard, we presume.", "description": "Barack Obama is so worried about global warming that he\u2019s about to buy a $14.8 million mansion on Martha\u2019s Vineyard.", "authors": ["Las Vegas Review-Journal"], "top_image": "https://www.reviewjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/12669182_web1_golfingobamaweb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
