Along with fellow members of the Amwell Magna Fishery, the oldest fly-fishing club in England, Sharkey was alarmed to find that the chalk stream had almost completely dried up, imperilling the brown trout for which his club has sustainably fished for almost two centuries.\n\nFeargal Sharkey is pictured on the River Lea in Harpenden , Hertfordshire, and is keen to take on water companies and the Environment Agency about the state of chalk streams in the UK\n\n\u2018Two weeks ago we learned that the upper part of the Lea was flowing at 47 per cent of its long-term average,\u2019 Sharkey says. \u2018That means half the river is missing right now. In essence, the river has gone into intensive care.\u2019\n\nAlthough Sharkey and the club members were able to save the fish, he knows that the threat is far from over, not only to the Lea, but also to the 224 other chalk streams in England.\n\n\u2018In a word, the state of them is catastrophic,\u2019 he says, with real anger in his voice. \u2018There is not a single chalk stream that is not suffering from extensive environmental damage. Even the River Test in Hampshire, perhaps the most famous chalk stream in the world, is under threat. And even if the water does go back into them, then it will take years or decades for their ecosystems to fully recover.\u2019\n\nBack in the 1970s and 80s, Feargal Sharkey, the lead singer of The Undertones, would be regularly spotted at The River Lea in Hertfordshire (archive picture from the 1980s) but now the chalk stream has 'gone into intensive care' and dried (pictured right last year)\n\nIt should be stressed that these are not the words of some proselytising pop star who has decided to jump on the latest bandwagon to burnish his cred. For 61-year-old Sharkey \u2013 who was given an OBE in June for services to music \u2013 is a grown-up who has been campaigning for years to draw attention to the desperate plight of chalk streams.\n\nAnd Sharkey is right to be angry, because these streams really are in a parlous condition, not only threatening the huge variety of wildlife that depends on them from Yorkshire down to Dorset, but also putting at risk something that is as quintessentially English as a game of cricket on a village green.\n\nFor chalk streams are almost only to be found in England, with just a handful in northern France. It\u2019s for this reason that they are often called \u2018our Amazon\u2019, an ecosystem almost completely unique to England, and not even to be found in the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\nIn short, the chalk stream \u2013 with its crystal waters, gravel beds, white flowering water crowfoot shimmying in the gentle flow, and the host of much-loved creatures such as trout, voles and kingfishers \u2013 really is one of our most precious environmental, and indeed cultural, assets.\n\nAfter all, that timeless children\u2019s classic The Wind In The Willows was set on a chalk stream, and Sir John Betjeman was even transported by them to a state of grace: \u2018When trout waved lazy in the clear chalk streams, Glory was in me...\u2019 he once wrote.\n\nIt was revealed that the river was flowing at 47 per cent of its long term average which means half the river is missing right now, according to Sharkey (pictured in May 2001)\n\nSo why are our chalk streams in such peril, and what can be done to save them, if indeed they can be saved? Before answering any of these questions, it is important to understand why chalk streams exist. Unlike normal rivers, which usually rely on groundwater running off the land, chalk streams are fed by springs which rise up from a layer of chalk deep beneath the ground. This chalk layer is known as an aquifer, and it holds an enormous amount of water that percolates into it during the winter from October to March, and is stored in its cracks and fissures.\n\nIn essence, the aquifer is a bit like a sponge, except this is a giant sponge made one hundred billion years ago from the skeletons of trillions upon trillions of sea insects. It is geologically unique, and obviously impossible to replicate.\n\nThe water that rises from the aquifer is absolutely pure, and if all is well, a chalk stream will flow throughout the summer, although the upper stretches may dry out. These stretches are called winterbournes, because they only bear water in the winter months. What is also remarkable is that whatever the air temperature, the water in a chalk stream remains at around ten degrees centigrade all year, and maintains a regular flow.\n\nBecause chalk streams are so constant \u2013 or should be so constant \u2013 they obviously make a great habitat not only for wildlife, but also for humans. \u2018These streams have been inextricably linked with man ever since the Mesolithic Period,\u2019 says archaeologist Dr Wendy Morrison, of the Chilterns Conservation Board. \u2018They are the reason why hill forts were sited where they were, and why many of today\u2019s towns are where they are.\u2019\n\nHe says the state of the chalk streams (pictured is River Lea in 2009) is 'catastophic' and there is not one which is not suffering from extensive environmental damage. Feargal said: 'Even if water goes back into the river, it will take years or decades for their ecosystems to fully recover'\n\nChalk streams, then, are the reason for the existence of cities and towns such as St Albans in Hertfordshire and Chesham in Buckinghamshire, both of which I visited last week to see the desperate states of the River Ver and the River Chess.\n\nI was shown the Ver \u2013 or what remains of it \u2013 by John Pritchard, 61, who lives near St Albans, and is the chairman of the Ver Valley Society. He has lived on the river for a quarter of a century, and has seen the decline in the chalk stream. \u2018In 2016, it just stopped flowing on some of the upper reaches,\u2019 he tells me as we drive from his cottage to the nearby Chequers Inn in the village of Redbourn. \u2018The river should normally be 28 kilometres long, but now 12 kilometres of it is dry.\u2019\n\nThe reason why we are going to the pub is not to have a pint, but rather to have a look at what lies at the bottom of the beer garden. We park next to a sign that reads: \u2018Caution: Water \u2013 Please keep children under control.'\n\nIt quickly becomes apparent that the sign is utterly redundant, as there is no water.\n\nWhat should be a gloriously glistening chalk stream in the garden of a traditional English pub is now a muddy and rubbish-festooned ditch, partly overgrown with weeds.\n\nWhat seems astonishing is that back in Roman times, the Ver \u2013 the name is derived from the Roman name for St Albans, Verulamium \u2013 was big enough to transport ships. Today, even on the stretches where there is a flow, it could carry little more than a model boat, and even then, one without a keel.\n\nMr Pritchard tells me that even if there is water, it does not mean all is well. \u2018A river with a quarter of an inch of water looks OK,\u2019 he says. \u2018But the problem is that low flow means vegetation builds up and then you get stagnant pools, which obviously are not good for fish, because the pools do not oxygenate.\u2019\n\nPictured is the former Lea in June this year and 'of the parts of the rivers that lie in the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, 63 per cent are dry'\n\nThe result is obvious \u2013 dead fish. Mr Pritchard shows me many photos of the corpses of brown trout that he has recovered, which are heartbreaking. The situation is similar some 15 miles away over in Chesham, down from where the River Chess flows some ten or 11 miles to Coln. In fact, it would be more correct to say used to flow, as there has been no river in the town for nearly a year. \u2018This is as bad as it\u2019s ever been,\u2019 says Paul Jennings, 62, a farmer and chair of the River Chess Association for the past decade.\n\nWe meet over a pint in the Queen\u2019s Head, which sits on the Chess \u2013 which is, of course, now a ditch. Ironically, above our heads is an old black-and-white photograph which shows the river in full spate \u2013 it could be somewhere else entirely.\n\nWe are joined by Allen Beechey, 43, who is the Chiltern Chalk Streams Project Officer, and who speaks with undisguised anger about the nine rivers he looks after. \u2018They are in a wretched state,\u2019 he says. \u2018These are rivers in crisis.\u2019\n\nThe River Pang near Bucklebury, Berkshire, has run dry from Bucklebury to its source seven miles upstream at Compton\n\nHe is not exaggerating, as he supplies me with a grim set of statistics. \u2018Of the parts of the rivers that lie in the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, 63 per cent are dry,\u2019 he says. \u2018Thirty per cent of the total lengths of those rivers are dry. Every river has a dry section, with 55 per cent of the Misbourne\u2019s 27 kilometres completely dry. Two of the chalk streams, the Hamble Brook and the Hughenden, have not flowed for a year.\u2019\n\nAfter our pint, Mr Jennings and Mr Beechey take me for a walk down what used to be the Chess. Mr Beechey tells me how he remembers growing up in Chesham, and looking over a wall into the river, where he would marvel at a pair of brown trout. We look over the same wall, and all that can be seen is black mud, the fish now ghosts.\n\nThat mud runs for hundreds of yards, all the way down the now ironically named Water Lane. Worse still, because the mud is composed of sediment from groundwater that has run off roads, it is full of hydrocarbons and heavy metals, and if you dug it out with your bare hands, you would come out in hives. When it is removed, it has to be taken to a special facility to be destroyed as hazardous waste.\n\nJohn Pritchard, chairman of the Ver Valley Society, says that 'low flow means vegetation builds up and then you get stagnant pools'. Corpses of dead fish are commonplace (pictured are fish which have surface in what was once a free-flowing river in Old Amersham, Buckinghamshire)\n\nA stick I pick up in a vain attempt to play Pooh sticks I instead use to measure the depth of the poisonous mud: it is almost a foot deep.\n\nHad the river been flowing properly, then all this sediment from the groundwater would be safely washed away by the spring water, but now there is no chance.\n\nThis, then, is what passes for a chalk stream in the Chilterns in 2019.\n\nSo why is this happening? The reasons are brutally simple.\n\nThe first \u2013 and the most over-riding \u2013 is that the water companies are draining the aquifer, that big sponge that holds the water that supplies the chalk streams. In Chesham alone, three abstraction points run by Affinity Water and Thames Water take out 12 million litres per day \u2013 that\u2019s about 80,000 baths. Remember that\u2019s per day \u2013 over a year that comes to 4.4 billion litres, or 29.2 million baths.\n\nThe second reason is that we have had three dry winters in a row, which means the aquifer has not had the chance to \u2018recharge\u2019 from October to March. But Feargal Sharkey points out that climate change cannot be used by the water companies to hide behind, as many rivers \u2013 like the Ver in 2016 \u2013 were drying up long before the past three winters.\n\nSharkey's solo single 'A Good Heart' was an international success in 1985 (archive image)\n\nThen there is the question of demand. As a nation, we are greedy for water, using around 150 litres per person per day, which compares badly to a similarly developed northern European country such as Denmark, where the figure is 114 litres.\n\nThe water companies therefore have a huge problem in meeting that demand. Everyone I spoke to said the Government needs to build more reservoirs, but the expense means decisions keep being delayed.\n\nMeanwhile, companies such as Affinity Water say that they are doing their best. \u2018We do not abstract water directly from chalk streams but from groundwater sources called aquifers and we have reduced our abstractions by 63 million litres of water a day since 1993 and have committed to reduce this by a further 36 million litres a day by 2025,\u2019 a spokesman said this week.\n\nThen there is the problem with the Environment Agency, for which Feargal Sharkey seems to reserve his greatest ire. \u2018The EA has a clear legal remit to protect these rivers,\u2019 he says. \u2018It has done nothing to revoke and amend the licences that the water companies are issued with, and the environmental damage is now massive.\u2019\n\nThe EA, like water companies, also maintains it is doing what it can. \u2018We are already working on more than 60 projects to improve stretches of chalk streams, restricting the amount of water that is removed and taking action to protect wildlife where water levels become too low,\u2019 a spokesman says.\n\nClearly, for the critics, all this is too late. \u2018We are tired of this whole scenario,\u2019 says Mr Beechey. \u2018What we are seeing is a gradual and unstoppable decline in rivers. We\u2019ll get to the stage where nothing is left.\u2019", "description": "Feargal Sharkey exposes the 'catastrophic' state of the UK's chalk streams and says even if water returns to the rivers, it will 'take decades' for the ecosystems to 'fully recover'.", "authors": ["Guy Walters For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/01/19347258-0-image-a-4_1570320386172.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
