His total also ran well behind Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders.\n\nThat\u2019s a problem for a candidate who is seeking to compete in all four early states and also build out his campaign infrastructure in the 14 states that will vote on Super Tuesday.\n\nMaking matters worse, Donald Trump and Republicans have announced they\u2019ll launch $10 million in negative TV ads \u2014 with $1 million targeted at the early nominating states alone \u2014 pushing the president\u2019s claim that Biden and his son Hunter engaged in corruption in Ukraine.\n\nTrump \u2014 who is facing an impeachment inquiry that centers on his asking the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son\u2019s business dealings \u2014 and Republicans together raised an eye-popping $125 million in the third quarter .\n\n\u201cThe reason it\u2019s happening is because Trump sees Biden as his biggest threat,\u201d said Patti Solis Doyle, a former Barack Obama adviser and onetime Biden chief of staff. \u201cIn some ways, it\u2019s a good thing because it frames it as a Biden versus Trump race. However, if Biden cannot compete on the other metrics in the field, then even that [advantage] goes away for him.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Between the campaign\u2019s need to spend to preserve its position in the primary and its need to defend against the flurry of GOP attacks, Biden will be fighting on two fronts, amid new doubts over whether Biden will have the resources necessary to do both.\n\nAnd Biden must continue to demonstrate vitality to donors or he\u2019ll face a fate similar to what Jeb Bush experienced in a crowded 2016 primary race in which the former Florida governor steadily fell behind, unable to recover from a surging Trump.\n\nDavid Kochel, a chief strategist in Bush\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, said like Biden, Bush was an early front-runner with high name ID who raised \u201ca boatload\u201d the first quarter but failed to grow after big donors maxed out. He said Biden is in danger of following a similar trendline because of the nature of his fundraising base.\n\n\u201cThe former vice president, with all the high-dollar contacts around the country \u2014 you do all the big fundraisers in the big cities. Once you do that, that\u2019s it. If you don\u2019t have that perpetual, low-dollar fundraising machine, you can\u2019t compete,\u201d Kochel said, noting the massive figures reported by Biden\u2019s top rivals. \u201cBiden looks like he can\u2019t compete with Warren, Bernie and Buttigieg. How\u2019s he going to compete with Trump?\u201d\n\nA Biden campaign statement Thursday on its fundraising disputed the notion that he wasn\u2019t building momentum or that his donors had maxed out. The last week of the quarter was Biden\u2019s best week since early May, according to the campaign, and 98 percent of its donations were $200 or less.\n\nThe Biden campaign is attempting to fend off incoming Trump ads by aggressively lobbying cable networks against airing a new Ukraine-oriented spot that it says \u201cspreads false, definitively debunked conspiracy theories.\u201d The campaign on Friday served Facebook with the same letter and is expected to do the same with local TV stations.\n\nThis week, it announced its own early state digital and TV ad buy \u2014 $6 million worth.\n\nBiden himself fought back against Trump in a Nevada appearance earlier this week.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me,\u201d Biden declared. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.\u201d\n\nSince the first reports that Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Biden, the former vice president\u2019s campaign has attempted to raise money off the scandal, crafting fundraising pitches around the latest headlines. On Friday, a new online fundraising request urged potential donors to chip in to a new \u201cBeat Trump Rapid Response Fund.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump declared war on our campaign today with a $1,000,000 TV ad campaign in the first four primary states,\u201d a request to donors blared, then asked for a $5 donation.\n\nThe Biden campaign says the attacks only validate its long-standing argument that Biden is the biggest threat to Trump\u2019s reelection. And it has repeatedly pointed to Trump\u2019s actions \u2014 including asking both Ukraine and China to investigate the former vice president \u2014 as a sign that Biden is the Democrat the president fears most as his general election opponent.\n\n\"This is happening for one reason: Donald Trump is trying to choose his opponent, and views Joe Biden as his biggest threat. Why else would he be targeting these ads in early primary states? He knows Biden has the durability to withstand them, so he's trying to take him out early,\u201d a Biden adviser said Friday. \u201cAnd what's undeniable is he's going to do exactly this or worse to whoever the Democratic nominee is \u2014 and no one else has proven they can handle it and fight back like Biden has.\"\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/42/fd/8a3559db4e54857a02e5bd3fb7ef/191004-biden-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
