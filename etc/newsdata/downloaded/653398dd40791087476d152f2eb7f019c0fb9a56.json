Photo: Netflix\n\nWriter-director David Mich\u00f4d delivers entertaining history with The King, his new Netflix movie about Henry V (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) and his ascendancy from partying teenager to warrior sovereign. At its Venice Film Festival premiere on Monday, Henry and his sparring partners \u2014 particularly France\u2019s Dauphin, an arrogant and ridiculous prince who provides a steady stream of comedy \u2014 snared some hearty gasps and laughs. A bewigged Robert Pattinson plays the preening, overdressed Gallic dandy. \u201cI like speaking English,\u201d he sneers in character. \u201cIt is a simple, ugly language.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just had a feeling he [Pattinson] would make it fun,\u201d Mich\u00f4d told the standing-room-only Sala Perla 2 press conference. \u201cI needed that. He is a supporting character. He doesn\u2019t appear in the movie until an hour in. It was very, very important to me that when he did appear it was with razzle-dazzle.\u201d\n\nWith Pattinson not in attendance in Venice, the conference\u2019s loudest cheers arrived for 23-year-old Chalamet, who, like the King he portrays, is having a youthful moment on the international scene post-Call Me By Your Name. Chalamet spoke elliptically about the struggle for peace depicted in The King. \u201cNight terrors bring about moments of bliss and peace,\u201d he proclaimed.\n\nLily-Rose Depp plays the Dauphin\u2019s sister, Henry\u2019s eventual wife. On- and off-screen, Depp has a natural movie star\u2019s poise and smile. At the press conference, she riffed on The King\u2019s depictions of power, and how Katherine impressively makes the most of her limited abilities.\n\nMich\u00f4d\u2019s chief collaborator, Joel Edgerton (who plays Henry\u2019s gregarious chief advisor Sir John Falstaff), was also in attendance, along with fellow Australian Ben Mendelsohn (who plays Henry\u2019s father, Henry). Edgerton spoke of filming the climactic Battle of Agincourt in Northern Hungary, in mud, sweltering heat, and body armor, along with approximately 200 other actors and 70 horses. \u201cI thought one day I was going to drown in the mud,\u201d Edgerton enthused.\n\nThe King hits U.S. theaters on October 11, and Netflix worldwide on November 1.", "description": "At a press conference at the Venice Film Festival, The King director David Mich\u00f4d teased his new Netflix movie, starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet.", "authors": ["Alexander Bisley"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/02/2-Robert-Pattinson.w1200.h630.png"}
