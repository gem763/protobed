The gold sector is currently giving a short-term pullback, and this is setting up another buying opportunity in gold shares, such as DRDGold.\n\n\n\nDRDGOLD (DRD): A pullback in an uptrend.\n\n\n\nBroad recommendation: Buy on this pullback.\n\nCurrent trend: Short-term down. Med- and long-term up.\n\nStrategy: Look to buy from the R5.50 level.\n\nChart setup: DRD triggered its initial buy when it broke out above line 2 a few months back: it has exceeded its first target from channel 1-2 and still has higher to go. \u2022 Its Elliot Wave count (roman numerals), shows it in a Wave-iv correction right now, with another large rally (Wave-v up) to come. (Elliot Wave analysis postulates five waves in the direction of the trend). \u2022 Its weekly Stochastic (on top) is relatively overbought, and can still pull back more before the price is ready to go again. (Daily chart) Strategy details: Look to buy it again on a pullback to/near the R5.50 level. (I like it see a reversal day/candle up in that area to enter). Target: After the pullback, a rally to the R10 level to start taking trading profits. Note, long-term resistance is line 4 at R12.62.\n\n\n\nStop-loss: A weekly (i.e. Friday) close below R5.00.\n\nColin Abrams is an independent technical analyst.
