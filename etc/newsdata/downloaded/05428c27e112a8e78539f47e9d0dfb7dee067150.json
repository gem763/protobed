She uses $150 of it to pay for her cellphone and another $100 or so to pay off her dog\u2019s veterinarian bills. She spends the rest on her two grandsons now that she can afford to buy them birthday presents online and let them get the big bag of chips at the 7-Eleven.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been able to do that. I thought it was just the coolest thing,\u201d said Garza, who is unemployed and previously was addicted to drugs, though she said she has been sober for 18 years following a stint in prison. \u201cI like it because I feel more independent, like I\u2019m in charge.
