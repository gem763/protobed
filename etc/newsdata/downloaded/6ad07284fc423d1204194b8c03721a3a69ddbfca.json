His unveiling occurred during the Bachelor in Paradise finale this evening, with Weber \u2014 a 28-year-old pilot for Delta \u2014 excitedly confirming his proverbial \u201cjourney\u201d to \u201cfind love.\u201d (Amazingly, there\u2019s only one Hannah and one Lauren competing for him!) He also beat out fellow handsome alums Tyler Cameron and Mike Johnson for the gig.\n\nThe California-born Weber was sent home on Brown\u2019s season after those multiple windmill trysts in Greece, ultimately finishing in third place with a good edit. (His parents, lest you forget, were very amused by his stamina.) While his presence was largely unassuming and drama-free throughout the season, he was plagued with one bit of bad press: His ex-girlfriend did an interview claiming he unexpectedly broke up with her after a year of dating to find fame within the franchise. \u201cHe interviewed for a reality dating show while simultaneously planning a future with me,\u201d Calee Lutes, a model, claimed of their relationship. \u201cAlso, if all of this wasn\u2019t bad enough, I\u2019ve had multiple people reach out to me and tell me that he was seeing other women while we were exclusive.\u201d Weber has never publicly addressed Lutes\u2019s claims.\n\nPer the normal cycle for Bachelor Nation shows, the 24th season of The Bachelor will premiere sometime in early 2020. We look forward to ABC trying to secure the music rights to \u201cCome Fly With Me\u201d in the meantime.", "description": "The next lead for The Bachelor will be Peter Weber.
