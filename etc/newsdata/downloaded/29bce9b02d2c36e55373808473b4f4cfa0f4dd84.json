What was previously known as a \"Double Spicy Hamburger\" will now just be a \"Double Spicy Burger\"; the \"Triple Hamburger with Cheese\" becomes the \"Triple Burger with Cheese\", and a \"Hamburger King Jr\" on the kids menu will now be just a \"Kids Burger\".\n\nThe names are being changed \"to be more respectful of\" its halaal client base, the chain said in a statement.\n\nThe name changes will apply across all Burger Kings in SA, including those that now serve bacon.\n\nSee also: These are all the Burger King restaurants in South Africa that will no longer be halaal from September\n\nThe word \"ham\" has featured on the Burger King menu since the chain opened its first store in South Africa in 2013. Up to September, all of its stores were fully halaal.\n\nA hamburger is by definition made of minced beef and does not contain pork. The \"ham\" is in reference to the German city of Hamburg, where hamburger patties were supposedly first made.\n\nBurger King knows this, South African chief operating officer Juan Klopper told Business Insider South Africa on Friday, but it still wants to avoid any possible confusion.\n\n\"It is just to be super-sensitive to perceptions, and to be super clear,\" he said.\n\nThe chain has had some queries from Muslim customers in the past on the \"ham\" part of the name, Klopper said, by way of Majlisush Shura Al Islami, the non-profit that certifies Burger King's remaining halaal outlets as being in compliance with Shari'ah law.\n\nSo, while the chain was making changes, it decided to drop the word.\n\nAs of this month, 44 Burger Kings in South Africa are no longer halaal certified after the chain decided to introduce the line of bacon items that are popular for the brand in many other parts of the world.\n\nThe chain has also promised to add vegan and vegetarian items to its menu \"in the very near future\".\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The \"ham\" in \"hamburger\" is a historical place reference, and has nothing to do with pork products.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8832/4a05cf029557452db65c42d3387b0886.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
