Despite the court order, they can not go back to work until the issues on the table are addressed,\u201d Ndoro said.\n\nThe doctors have already said an offer to raise their allowances by 60% was \u201cridiculous\u201d as it would take their monthly salaries to around 1,700 Zimbabwe dollars ($111), well below their demand of a 400% salary hike.\n\nZimbabwe is grappling with its worst economic crisis in a decade, amid triple-digit inflation, rolling power cuts and shortages of U.S. dollars, medicines and fuel.\n\nThe doctors\u2019 strike has seen some patients being turned away without treatment.", "description": "A Zimbabwean court has ordered doctors on a 40-day strike over pay to return to work within 48 hours, after a ruling that their boycott was illegal.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
