Shaw & Co. plan to meet with directors Thursday, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the meeting wasn\u2019t public. Foster and Stevens together control about 1.7% of the second-biggest U.S. refiner.\n\nMarathon is aiming to make a decision on the CEO and its strategy going forward by the time of the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings call on Oct. 31, the people said. The activists view Executive Vice Chairman Greg Goff, who joined Marathon after its purchase of Andeavor, as a well-respected potential replacement for Heminger, according to the people. Representatives for Elliott, D.E. Shaw, Foster and Stevens declined to comment.\n\n\u201cMarathon has delivered substantial shareholder value under the leadership of Chairman and CEO Gary Heminger, who has the full support of the board,\u201d Marathon said in a statement. \u201cAs we have said publicly, the company is conducting a comprehensive strategic review, and has been collecting feedback from many shareholders as is our practice. The review is ongoing and no conclusions have been reached.\u201d\n\nMarathon shares rose 2.3% to $64.10 in New York after earlier climbing as much as 4.3%.\n\nLast month Elliott, which recently took a 2.5% stake in Marathon, renewed its push for Marathon to split into three separate companies in order to unlock more than $22 billion in value. Foster and Stevens released a letter days later demanding Heminger\u2019s ouster. D.E. Shaw, which owned a 0.9% stake as of the end of June, has also been pushing Marathon to find ways to unlock more value, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nIn their meeting this week, Stevens and Foster told board members that they\u2019re hearing significant support among shareholders for Heminger to step down and agreement with Elliott\u2019s plan to break up the company, according to one of the people. But board members responded that shareholders have told Marathon\u2019s investor relations team that they don\u2019t object to Heminger staying on as CEO, the person said.\n\nHeminger -- who was given an exemption from the company\u2019s age-65 mandatory retirement rule in July 2018 -- took charge of the Findlay, Ohio-based company when Marathon Oil Corp. spun off the business in 2011 and has been fighting activist shareholders ever since. While the Ohio native has previously assuaged investors including Jana Partners LLC and overseen a five-fold rise in dividend payouts, the company has faltered more recently as it sought to expand through acquisitions, including the purchase of rival Andeavor.\n\nHeminger appeared with Goff in a video posted to YouTube two weeks ago, with the CEO saying he welcomes feedback from shareholders.\n\n\u201cAligning two organizations of this size is complex and challenging, but we\u2019ve been steadily improving our operations,\u201d Heminger, sitting in a wood-paneled room, said on the video. \u201cWe agree that our share value does not fully reflect the underlying value of our assets.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Kiel Porter and Rachel Adams-Heard.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Scott Deveau in New York at sdeveau2@bloomberg.net;David Wethe in Houston at dwethe@bloomberg.net;Catherine Ngai in New York at cngai16@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Simon Casey at scasey4@bloomberg.net, Christine Buurma\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Marathon Petroleum Corp. board members are meeting this week with activist investors to discuss Chief Executive Officer Gary Heminger\u2019s future and the company\u2019s strategy amid calls to split up its businesses, according to people familiar with the matter.After investors Paul Foster and", "authors": ["Scott Deveau", "David Wethe", "Catherine Ngai"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6g3KqGz.MLo7Ie.SU82BXA--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MTk5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/baee56e1ecd328549ae2ac7d0815c1d0", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
