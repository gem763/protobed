The firewall reboots continued for hours, prompting the power grid operator to start an investigation.\n\n\"Subsequent analysis determined that the reboots were initiated by an external entity exploiting a known firewall vulnerability,\" NERC said.\n\nThe power grid operator eventually discovered that they had failed to apply firmware updates for the firewalls that were under attack. The reboots stopped after the operator deployed the proper patches.\n\nThe operator blamed its failure to apply the firewall security updates on the lack of a proper firmware review process to vet security updates before being deployed. Work was being done on standardizing such process, but the procedure had not been ready in time, resulting in a bottleneck of firmware updates not being reviewed and deployed.\n\nThe incident didn't result in a major intrusion; however, NERC intentionally highlighted the March 2019 attacks in order to draw attention to the fact that many companies may not be deploying firmware updates in a timely manner, resulting in security holes being opened on their networks.\n\nNERC lays out a series of recommendations on dealing with firewalls and patches in its private report. A copy of this report was obtained by E&E News reporters, who first broke the story over the weekend.\n\nA quick summary of these recommendations are below, but we recommend reading the entire set in the report:", "description": "Hackers used a DoS flaw to reboot firewalls at an electric power grid operator for hours.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/10/14/d189f786-1d7e-401d-9e38-f78ac94e5edf/thumbnail/770x578/2d9491d069311178c0bffe4778238f65/blackout.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
