It was not broadcast after the North refused to screen it live.\n\nThe Korea Football Association (KFA) wrote a letter of complaint to the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) that fans and media were not allowed to attend the match, the Yonhap news agency reported.\n\n\u201cWe asked North Korea on multiple occasions for help in allowing our media and supporters to travel to Pyongyang, but North Korea refused to cooperate,\u201d the KFA said.\n\n\u201cWe believe the AFC should review whether it should discipline North Korea\u2019s football association for its lack of cooperation in these and other matters.\u201d\n\nAn AFC spokesman said global body FIFA was the governing entity for World Cup qualifiers.\n\nLast year saw a flurry of sports diplomacy between the neighbours but ties have since cooled over stalled negotiations over the North\u2019s nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.\n\nThey are technically still at war as their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty.\n\nTottenham Hotspur\u2019s South Korean striker Son Heung-min said it had been a bad-tempered match.\n\n\u201cThe game was so tough that I think we were very lucky already to be back with no one injured,\u201d he told reporters on Thursday upon arrival at Incheon.\n\n\u201cWe could even hear many very offensive curses from the other side.\u201d", "description": "South Korea's national soccer federation has asked the sport's continental body to consider action against North Korea for staging their 2022 World Cup qualifier behind closed doors, according to a local media report on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
