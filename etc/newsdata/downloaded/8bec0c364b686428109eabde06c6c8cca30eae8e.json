About 100,000 others in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island also had no electricity.\n\nThough no longer a hurricane, the storm is still packing cyclone-strength winds reaching about 130 kph (81 mph), the Canadian Hurricane Centre said.\n\n\u201cDorian will slowly weaken as it moves northeastward across northern Newfoundland later today and east of Labrador tonight,\u201d the centre said overnight.\n\nThe defence ministry said it would send up to 700 troops to help in the clean-up, and Nova Scotians have been asked to stay off the roads so that crews can safely remove trees and debris to restore power.\n\n\u201cThere is extensive damage,\u201d Karen Hutt, chief executive office of Nova Scotia Power Inc, said in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. \u201cThis storm was intense\u201d and it will be \u201cdays not hours\u201d before power is restored to everyone.\n\nThe storm blew over a large construction crane in downtown Halifax, the capital of the province of Nova Scotia, on Saturday.
