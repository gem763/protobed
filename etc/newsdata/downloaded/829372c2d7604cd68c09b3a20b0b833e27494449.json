But the future king and queen know the media comes with the job \u2013 \u00adhelping to sell The Firm and sustain the monarchy\u2019s popularity\n\n(Image: Ian Vogler / Daily Mirror)\n\nAnd they know the \u201cpress pack\u201d is just a collection of dedicated, professional people. So, when the royal plane was stuck in a nasty thunderstorm over Lahore, William went down the aisle to check they were OK and have a laugh.\n\nWhat a contrast to his brother Harry, whose obsessive hatred for the press is truly concerning. He and Meghan did a brilliant job on their African tour and highlighted Diana\u2019s unfinished landmine campaign.\n\nI\u2019d even forgotten about that eco-warrior/private jet hypocrisy.\n\nBut then Harry accused the press of hounding Meghan, suggesting we will drive her to her death as he wrongly thinks we did Diana.\n\nI know he was only 12 when she died and his grief and rage at her loss are understandable.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nBut, in an ITV film tonight, Harry calls it \u201ca festering wound\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to his press pal Tom Bradbury he says: \u201cI think being part of this family, in this role, in this job, very single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash it takes me straight back, so in that respect it\u2019s the worst reminder of her life, as \u00adopposed to the best.\u201d\n\nIt sounds as if life in front of the lens has become agony for Harry.\n\nBut his admirable work around mental health must have taught him the dangers of ignoring that festering sore. If it\u2019s ever going to heal then perhaps Harry needs to build that second home in Africa and start a new life with Meghan and baby Archie.\n\nIt could be time to step out of the royal picture completely.", "description": "Prince William and Kate have just finished a hugely successful tour of Pakistan, while Prince Harry is about to appear in a TV documentary where life in front of the lens seems like agony", "authors": ["Rachael Bletchly", "Image", "Ian Vogler", "Daily Mirror", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20653858.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FILES-BRITAIN-ROYALS-MEDIA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
