Nearly every Republican officeholder has opposed gun control measures.\n\nRead full poll results and how the poll was conducted\n\nThat signals that both sides of the gun control debate are energized for the Nov. 5 elections, when all 140 seats in the General Assembly are on the ballot. Republicans are defending thin majorities of 51 to 48 in the House of Delegates and 20 to 19 in the Senate, with one vacancy in each chamber.\n\nLike the majority of Virginians, Steve Hunter supports certain gun-control measures. He thinks taking guns away from people deemed a danger is a good idea. He not only supports background checks for all gun purchases but would like to see checks expanded to include social media posts that might offer insight into the person\u2019s state of mind.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the retired Philip Morris employee who lives in rural Prince George County intends to vote for Republicans, even though GOP leaders have quashed such bills. He fears Democrats would move on to measures he considers extreme.\n\n\u201cWhat makes a lot of gun owners leery that is, okay, you\u2019re going to do that and . . . it just goes on and on and never quits,\u201d Hunter, 70, said. \u201cYou open Pandora\u2019s box.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of the Virginia Beach shooting, Gov. Ralph Northam (D) convened a special legislative session to take up gun control, but Republicans shut it down without considering a single bill. They referred the legislation to a commission for study. That elevated guns even higher as a campaign issue, with Democrats pledging action if they win the majority and Republicans warning gun supporters about the same.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNational gun-control groups have given millions to Democrats \u2014 one group alone, Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund, pledged $2.5 million \u2014 while the National Rifle Association gave $200,000 to Republicans, the largest single donation it has ever made in Virginia.\n\nThe Post-Schar School poll finds that less than half of Virginia voters are paying close attention to the campaigns. Overall, Virginia registered voters narrowly prefer Democrats over Republicans, 49 percent to 42 percent. That edge widens slightly among those who say they are certain to vote, who prefer Democrats 52 percent to 41 percent.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 overall advantage suggests the statewide mood continues to favor them, but control of those chambers will ultimately be decided in a handful of competitive state House and Senate races.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany Virginians seem to have shrugged off the scandals that engulfed the state\u2019s top Democrats earlier this year, when Northam and Attorney General Mark R. Herring admitted to blackface incidents in the 1980s and Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax denied claims by two women that he sexually assaulted them in the early 2000s. Northam\u2019s approval rating stands at 47 percent, with 29 percent disapproving. Almost a quarter of Virginians have no opinion on his job performance.\n\nVirginia Republicans thought calling Ralph Northam \u2018Gov. Blackface\u2019 would help them. That\u2019s changed.\n\nThat\u2019s a marked improvement from Northam\u2019s numbers in February shortly after the scandals broke, when another Washington Post-Schar School poll found voters split about evenly, with 43 percent approving and 44 percent disapproving.\n\nWhile not devastating to his party, Northam is clearly somewhat of a drag on the Democrats. A 55 percent majority of Virginians say they are bothered by his handling of the scandal or the blackface incident itself, in which he first took responsibility for a racist photo on his 1984 medical school yearbook page, then denied being involved but admitted to darkening his face for a dance contest later that year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNearly 3 in 10 Virginia voters say their view of Northam is \u201cvery important\u201d to their vote, and Republicans lead by 14 percentage points among those voters.\n\nPresident Trump is an even bigger factor, however, cited as \u201cvery important\u201d to their vote by 51 percent. That is up from 38 percent who said he was an important motivator in 2017, when anti-Trump Democrats and independents turned out in massive numbers and flipped a record number of Republican seats in the House of Delegates.\n\nTrump\u2019s approval rating among Virginia residents is at 39 percent, with 58 percent disapproving of his job performance. But voters who say Trump is highly important in their vote split nearly evenly between supporting Democratic and Republican candidates for the state legislature, 48 percent to 45 percent.\n\nAD\n\nIn an \u201coff-off\u201d year election with no statewide or federal races atop the ticket, turnout is traditionally very low. But the poll finds that nearly 6 in 10 registered voters say they are certain to vote, which is on par with interest in Virginia\u2019s 2017 gubernatorial election two years ago, when turnout was 48 percent.\n\nAD\n\nVirginia\u2019s \u201coff-off year\u201d elections were sleepy. And then came Trump.\n\nHistory suggests turnout is unlikely to reach that level, but the poll hints that it could be significantly higher than in the last off-off year election in 2015, when 29 percent of registered voters went to the polls, according to the Virginia Department of Elections.\n\n\u201cTurnout is the key factor,\u201d said Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. \u201cSo many things seem to be pointing in a Democratic direction, but . . . Republicans have always done a little bit better in these off-off year elections in getting their voters to show up.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe distraction of the national presidential campaigns and ongoing drama in Washington threatens to divert energy and attention from local races for politics-weary Virginians, he said.\n\nLegislative races are particularly hard to predict because factors are so different in various regions of the state. Democrats lead by a wide margin of 42 points in the inner D.C. suburbs, but in the more competitive Northern Virginia exurbs, Republicans are up by 12 percentage points. Democrats fare well in the Tidewater region, while Republicans have small edges in central/western Virginia and the Richmond/eastern parts of the state\n\nAD\n\nThe issue of abortion, which Republicans had hoped would work in their favor this year after an uproar over a late-term abortion bill brought by Democrats in the last General Assembly session, appears to have gained little traction. Fewer than half of Virginia voters \u2014 46-percent \u2014 say the issue is very important in casting their vote, and that group splits almost evenly between favoring Democrats and Republicans.\n\nAD\n\nEducation comes in just after guns as a top concern for voters, with 70 percent saying it is very important, followed by health care at 66 percent and the economy at 63 percent.\n\nDemocrats lead by more than 20 percentage points among voters focused on education and health care. Voters focused on other issues split roughly even in their partisan support for Virginia\u2019s legislature.\n\nMoney flowing to Virginia legislative races from both sides of gun control issue\n\nThe poll suggests gun policy is a more prominent issue to Virginia voters this year than it was in last year\u2019s U.S. Senate race. In 2018, according to a survey of Virginia voters by the Associated Press and Fox News, 9 percent of Virginia voters said \u201cgun policy\u201d was the most important issue facing the country. That ranked below health care (27 percent), immigration (22 percent), and the economy and jobs (19 percent). It also ranked about even with the environment (8 percent) and foreign policy (6 percent). Among the 9 percent who said gun policy was the most important issue, almost 9 in 10 voted to reelect Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.).\n\nAD\n\nThe Post-Schar School poll shows gun ownership is a persistently sharp dividing line. Nearly half of Virginians live in households with a gun, and this group favors Republicans by 16 points over Democrats in elections this fall. Democrats lead by 43 points among voters that have no guns in their household.\n\n\u201cI have a couple of guns myself, but I don\u2019t think that anybody needs an assault weapon,\u201d said Linda Leidy, 62, a retired social worker who lives near Williamsburg and plans to vote for Democrats in November. She supports universal background checks, limits on magazine size and a ban on assault weapons.\n\nLeidy noted the two-year anniversary of a shooting that killed 58 people at a music festival on the Las Vegas Strip, in which the shooter had 23 assault-style weapons. \u201cThose people didn\u2019t have a chance,\u201d she said.\n\nOverall, 58 percent of Virginia adults favor stricter gun laws in the state. That is roughly similar to the share of Virginians who favored stricter gun control laws in Post polls from 2007-2016.\n\nThere is broad support among Virginians for expanded background checks (88 percent) and \u2018red flag\u2019 laws (82 percent) that allow authorities to temporarily seize weapons from someone who has been deemed a threat.\n\nThat support cuts across party lines \u2014 95 percent of Democrats, 89 percent of independents and 81 percent of Republicans support expanded background checks; 94 percent of Democrats, 81 percent of independents and 72 percent of Republicans support red flag laws.\n\nScott Smith, an insurance agent and gun owner who lives in a rural area on the outskirts of Spotsylvania, has mixed feelings about gun policy. He opposes a ban on assault weapons, but he supports expanded background checks, a red flag law and a reinstatement of a one-per-month cap on handgun purchases.\n\n\u201cI would like to see somebody do something, but then again, I don\u2019t want to see them overreach,\u201d said Smith, 65, a political independent who said he hasn\u2019t decided how he\u2019ll vote.\n\nThe Washington Post-Schar School poll was conducted Sept. 25-30 among a random sample of 876 Virginia adults, including 55 percent reached on cellphones and 45 percent on landlines. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus five percentage points for the overall sample as well as for the sample of 814 registered voters.\n\nEmily Guskin contributed to this report.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Favorable signs for Democrats in Washington Post-Schar School poll, but GOP could have turnout advantage.", "authors": ["Gregory S.
