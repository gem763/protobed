The CSI300 of blue-chip mainland shares were up 0.6% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index jumped 1.0%.\n\nJapan's Nikkei was also upbeat, rising 0.3% to a one-year high.\n\nThe gains came after a positive session in U.S. and European markets on Friday.\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials are \"close to finalising\" some parts of a trade agreement after high-level telephone discussions on Friday, the U.S. Trade Representative's office and China's Commerce Ministry said, with talks to continue. President Donald Trump has said he hopes to sign the deal with China's President Xi Jinping next month at a summit in Chile.\n\nThe protracted trade war between the world's largest economies has hurt manufacturing activity, exports and business confidence globally while denting profits of many major industrial firms.\n\n\"Up until now, uncertainties from the U.S.-China trade have held companies from spending and hiring.
