EU resisted PMs enthusiasm to head into tunnel immediately after presented his proposals last week. Needs trust + a big leap forward considering how far apart both sides were on key issues this week.. \u2014 katya adler (@BBCkatyaadler) October 11, 2019\n\nHOLD UP! It might not be a full tunnel. More of an underpass. https://t.co/p8yxTyTsAb \u2014 Matt Wells (@MatthewWells) October 11, 2019\n\nEU diplomats confirm to @AFP that EU27 has given green light for Brexit talks to enter a negotiation 'tunnel' (ie. intense negs with a communication blackout \u2014 no briefings, no leaks).\n\nThis just days before Oct17 make-or-break EU summit. \u2014 Marc Burleigh (@marcburleigh) October 11, 2019\n\nMarc Burleigh, Brussels correspondent for AFP, indicates that \u201ctunnel\u201d negotiatons are essentially just regular negotiations without breifings or leaks, conducted in an \u201cintense\u201d way \u2014 which rather raises the question of what EU and British negotiators have been doing up until now, considering Brexit was originally supposed to take place on March 29th and its current deadline is only twenty days away.\n\nMr Burleigh\u2019s initial claim that Barnier has been given the \u201cgreen light\u201d for such talks now seems uncertain, however, with a number of other reporters inflicting an abundance of mixed metaphors on observers by suggesting that the governments of the EU27 will not enter a \u201ctunnel\u201d with the British without being able to see a \u201clanding zone\u201d at the end of it.\n\nThe European Commission has confirmed that the EU and British teams \u201chave agreed to intensify discussions over the coming day\u201d, but according to CNN reporter Bianca Nobilo this falls short of \u201csecret tunnel talks\u201d, and is \u201cmore of a journey into Plato\u2019s cave\u201d.\n\nWhether or not there was ever really anything to report other than that the two negotiating teams are still negotiating remains unclear.\n\nEu statement on Brexit talks \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc. \u201cThe EU and UK have agreed to intensify discussions over the coming days\u201d, so no secret tunnel talks just yet\u2026more of a journey into Plato\u2019s cave https://t.co/BjWB7vVjM9 \u2014 Bianca Nobilo (@bianca_nobilo) October 11, 2019\n\nMaybe the real tunnel negotiations were the friends we made along the way \u2014 Stephen Canning \ud83d\ude04 (@EssexCanning) October 11, 2019\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "description": "Mainstream media outlets are ablaze with the \"news\" that the EU and UK negotiations may or may not be about to enter a \"tunnel\".", "authors": ["Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/09/Barnier-2.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
