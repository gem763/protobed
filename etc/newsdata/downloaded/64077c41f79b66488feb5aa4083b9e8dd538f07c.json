Like the famous literary character, the insect is smaller than its relations and is found in New Zealand\u2019s South Island, the location where the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies were filmed.\n\nThe Psylla frodobagginsi was identified by Francesco Martoni and Karen Armstrong, who examined the psyllid insects during research for Martoni\u2019s PhD, with the New Zealand\u2019s Bio-Protection Research Centre.\n\nIt is not the first time Kiwi insects have been named after hobbits. In 2013 scientists discovered a new species of wasp that were small, short and stout and named them after Bilbo, Frodo, Merry, Pippin and Sam.\n\nTiny penguin released back into wild after swimming from New Zealand to Australia Read more\n\nDuring their research, the pair also solved an 87-year-old mystery about why there was so much variation in what is called the k\u014dwhai psyllid. There are in fact two different varieties of psyllid: the Psylla apicalis and the slightly smaller Psylla frodobagginsi.\n\nFor his PhD research, Martoni examined psyllids collected from k\u014dwhai trees in 21 South Island locations and described consistent differences between two types, which allowed them to be classified as two distinct species.\n\n\u201cPsylla frodobagginsi can be identified most easily by its small dimension, light colours, and uniformly spotted wings,\u201d the authors wrote in their paper outlining the research.\n\n\u201cPsylla frodobagginsi is smaller than P. apicalis, with males as small as 1.24 mm, compared to the 1.65mm of P. apicalis, and females as small as 1.56 mm, against the 2.03 mm of P. Apicalis.\u201d\n\nThe name is likely to be seen as an improvement on the psyllids\u2019 more common name of jumping plant lice.", "description": "The newly-classified species of psyllid is found on the South Island, where the Tolkein movies were filmed", "authors": ["Angela Cuming"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b786358af680269036aa921d241f0d17d72f92df/0_4_1392_835/master/1392.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d0edfcf7e36398a9a6346557b6fed5aa", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
