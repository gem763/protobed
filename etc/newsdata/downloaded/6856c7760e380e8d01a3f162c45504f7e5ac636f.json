Bolton again has to decide whether to give up on long-held beliefs\u2014this time about the power of the presidency\u2014to be popular in Washington. Of course, subpoenas have a way of making decisions easier. Bolton could just go along to get along, deciding to exact some revenge on Trump with a deposition filled with a detailed litany of any presidential crimes and misdemeanors.\n\nBut subpoenas rarely change anyone\u2019s mind, let alone one as disciplined and devoted as Bolton\u2019s. The power of the modern presidency is Bolton\u2019s career legacy, a project he has been working on longer than North Korea, Iran or any one issue. When Trump and his defenders question the legitimacy of today\u2019s inquiry, they\u2019re not just speaking Bolton\u2019s language\u2014they\u2019re using his talking points. Even if Bolton soured on Trump or disagreed with his Ukraine scheme, the current resident of the White House is unlikely to have changed the former national security adviser\u2019s belief that the United States needs a strong commander in chief.\n\nFor that reason, Bolton\u2019s decision to consider providing a deposition is as momentous as it surely was tortured. His testimony will likely be the same.", "description": "", "authors": ["John Gans", "Politico.Com Magazine Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
