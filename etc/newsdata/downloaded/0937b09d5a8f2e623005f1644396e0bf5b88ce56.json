At least five deaths were blamed on the storm.\n\n\u201cWe are in the midst of a historic tragedy,\u201d Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said in announcing the fatalities. He called the devastation \u201cunprecedented and extensive.\u201d\n\nThe fearsome Category 4 storm slowed almost to a standstill as it shredded roofs, hurled cars and forced even rescue crews to take shelter until the onslaught passed.\n\nOfficials said they received a \u201ctremendous\u201d number of calls from people in flooded homes. A radio station received more than 2,000 distress messages, including reports of a 5-month-old baby stranded on a roof and a grandmother with six grandchildren who cut a hole in a roof to escape rising floodwaters. Other reports involved a group of eight children and five adults stranded on a highway and two storm shelters that flooded.\n\nThe deaths in the Bahamas came after a previous storm-related fatality in Puerto Rico. At least 21 people were hurt in the Bahamas and evacuated by helicopters, the prime minster said.\n\nPolice Chief Samuel Butler urged people to remain calm and share their GPS coordinates, but he said rescue crews had to wait until weather conditions improved.\n\n\u201cWe simply cannot get to you,\u201d he told Bahamas radio station ZNS.\n\nForecasters warned that Dorian could generate a storm surge as high as 23 feet (7 meters).\n\nMeanwhile in the United States, the National Hurricane Center extended watches and warnings across the Florida and Georgia coasts. Forecasters expected Dorian to stay off shore, but meteorologist Daniel Brown cautioned that \u201conly a small deviation\u201d could draw the storm\u2019s dangerous core toward land.\n\nBy 8 p.m. EDT Monday, the storm\u2019s top sustained winds had fallen to 140 mph (220 kph), still within Category 4 range. It was virtually stationary, centered just 25 miles (40 kilometers) northeast of Freeport. Hurricane-force winds extended outward as far as 45 miles (75 kilometers) from the center\n\nThe water reached roofs and the tops of palm trees. One woman filmed water lapping at the stairs of her home\u2019s second floor.\n\nIn Freeport, Dave Mackey recorded video showing water and floating debris surging around his house as the wind shrieked outside.\n\n\u201cOur house is 15 feet up, and right now where that water is is about 8 feet. So we\u2019re pretty concerned right now because we\u2019re not at high tide,\u201d said Mackey, who shared the video with The Associated Press. \u201cOur garage door has already come off. ... Once we come out of it with our lives, we\u2019re happy.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Dorian churned over Abaco Island with battering winds and surf and heavy flooding.\n\nParliament member Darren Henfield described the damage as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and said officials did not have information on what happened on nearby cays. \u201cWe are in search-and-recovery mode. ... Continue to pray for us.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Bahamas Power and Light told ZNS that there was a blackout in New Providence, the archipelago\u2019s most populous island. He said the company\u2019s office in Abaco island was flattened.\n\n\u201cThe reports out of Abaco as everyone knows,\u201d spokesman Quincy Parker said, pausing for a deep sigh, \u201cwere not good.\u201d\n\nMost people went to shelters as the storm neared. Tourist hotels shut down, and residents boarded up their homes. Many people were expected to be left homeless.\n\nOn Sunday, Dorian\u2019s maximum sustained winds reached 185 mph (297 kph), with gusts up to 220 mph (354 kph), tying the record for the most powerful Atlantic hurricane ever to make landfall. That equaled the Labor Day hurricane of 1935, before storms were named. The only recorded storm that was more powerful was Hurricane Allen in 1980, with 190 mph (305 kph) winds, though it did not make landfall at that strength.\n\nThe Bahamas archipelago is no stranger to hurricanes. Homes are required to have metal reinforcements for roof beams to withstand winds into the upper limits of a Category 4 hurricane, and compliance is generally tight for those who can afford it. Risks are higher in poorer neighborhoods that have wooden homes in low-lying areas.\n\nDorian was likely to begin pulling away from the Bahamas early Tuesday and curving to the northeast parallel to the southeastern coast of the U.S. The system is expected to spin 40 to 50 miles (64 to 80 kilometers) off Florida, with hurricane-force wind speeds extending about 35 miles (56 kilometers) to the west.", "description": "Forecasters warned that Dorian could generate a storm surge as high as 23 feet.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yD2ChKqUe8.JDXkD812lGQ--~B/aD03NzM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/c305ac982ac0844cdec60484e80e43ab"}
