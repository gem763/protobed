This is an important announcement because of racist behaviour that is interfering with the game.\n\n\"The referee has indicated that the players will suspend the match. Racism will not be tolerated and the game will be abandoned if the racism continues.\n\n\"Help everyone enjoy the game and say no to racism.\"\n\n(Image: Andy Commins / Daily Mirror)\n\nEngland, 2-0 up at the time through goals from Marcus Rashford and Ross Barkley, then scored a third through Barkley within seconds of the re-start of the game.\n\nSterling then produced the best answer the bigots - with the fourth goal to put England 4-0 up at half time before he bagged a fifth in the second half.\n\nThe anti-racism announcement was made on 28 minutes, and met with boos from sections of the Bulgarian crowd - and applause from the 3,800 England fans.\n\nUEFA had ordered 5,000 seats at Sofia\u2019s 46,340-capacity Vasil Levski Stadium to be closed off at the match over race offences at Kosovo and Czech Republic games.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nEngland stars had pledged to make a stand, and followed a three-step procedure if racist chants were heard. It is the first time in an international game that such a warning has been made, after discussions between the referee, Croatian Ivan Bebek, manager Gareth Southgate and the fourth official.\n\nThe game was stopped again on 43 minutes, again over apparent gestures from the stands.\n\nEngland fans responded with chants of \"you racist b*******, you know what you are\" and \"Who put the ball in the racists' net? Raheem f*****g Sterling\" as they backed their players after their stand.\n\nThree Lions fan Carol Perrin, 54 a nurse from Stockton-on-Tees, Co Durham, at the game with her husband Kevin, backed the players' brave move. \"I think that there comes a time when you have to make a stand,\" she said.\n\n\"Nothing really happens in terms of changing the fans' behaviour and it just does not deter people. This way you get the message across.\n\n(Image: itvfootball/Twitter)\n\n\"It is about a principle, and if you are black player, you have to put yourself in their shoes. Imagine how must they feel in this position? I believe the rest of the team should support them.\"\n\nWind farm technician Kevin - known as 'Reggie' - said simply: \"It is the right thing to do. You should do that even if you are on the verge of qualifying and you are 4-0 up with two minutes to go.\n\n\"I back them as well, and would have backed them if they had walked off\"\n\nThe empty area of the stadium marked with '#equalgame respect' banners, with the game was played in front of a sparse 10,000 crowd, and three quarters of the seats empty.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nAccountant Brad Morris, 22, of Blackburn, Lancs., who travelled to Prague to see our 2-1 defeat by the Czech Republic, said:\n\n\"If you were black, you would feel completely differently. It is up to them to choose.\n\n\"Nobody can really understand how that must be when you are targeted.\"\n\nSouthgate had pledged to follow the Uefa protocol if there were racist chants. That demands: an appeal to stop over the PA system, temporary suspension of the game if abuse continues then the abandonment of the fixture if there is still no response.\n\nLast night, the stadium announcer told the crowd at 8pm - 45 minutes before kick-off to a near empty stadium: \"Remember, there is no place for racism.\"\n\n(Image: Andy Commins / Daily Mirror)\n\nBut young black England star Tammy Abraham had warned before the game that the Three Lions were ready to march off together as soon as the abuse is heard. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had meetings about it and we\u2019ve touched base on how to deal with the situation.\n\n\"Harry Kane even said that if it happens and we\u2019re not happy with it, we all come off the pitch together. It is a team thing.\n\nDon\u2019t isolate one person. Harry did ask the question about instead of going through the three steps.\n\n\"If we\u2019re not happy as a team we\u2019ll decide whether or not to stay on the pitch.\u201d\n\nThe Bulgarian Football Association was fiercely critical of the England players's stance insisting that they did not have a bad record on racism at international games.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBut Pavel Klymenko, of Fare, an umbrella organisation that fights inequality in football, said: \"Bulgarian football has been infiltrated by far-right groups who use the stadiums to spread their message of hate.\n\n\"We have been trying to work with the Bulgarian FA to do more positive things, but they are not interested. They have not even responded to our letters.\"\n\nThere have been around a dozen high profile racist incidents within Bulgarian football over the past 18 months with fans abusing black players or unfurling discriminatory or Nazi banners.\n\nDuring last year\u2019s Bulgarian Cup final, one young boy was seen giving Nazi salutes while another was displaying a swastika across his chest. There will be a number of Fare representatives amongst home fans at the game to monitor and report any incidents of racism.\n\nAlong with other campaigners, the organisation has demanded the issuing of banning orders for those found guilty of racist or discriminatory behaviour and a concerted drive by the Bulgarian FA to educate and engage with fans.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nMr Klymenko: \u2018We do not even have the provision of banning orders within Bulgarian football. Even when the perpetrators are identified they continue to attend matches. The question is, is the will there within the Bulgarian FA to do anything about racism and discrimination within their game?\"\n\nThe last time England played in Sofia in 2011, the home nation was sanctioned by Uefa following racist chanting by its fans.\n\nBut a spokesman for the Bulgarian FA insisted they had been working hard to prevent racist abuse within its national game.\n\nHristo Zapryanov said that the 2,000 leaflets had been distributed with signs also be in place at the stadium warning spectators of \u2018proper conduct.\u2019 He revealed that all stewards and police have been issued with strict instructions to eject any fans involved in racial or discriminatory behaviour.\n\nMr Zapryanov added: \"They will be arrested and dealt with. Everyone is aware of the fact that the England group is extremely sensitive to this issue following problems in previous games.\"\n\nBorislav Mihaylov, the President of the Bulgarian FA wrote a letter of complaint to Uefa accusing England of \u2018offensive, unjust\u2019 and \u2018derogatory\u2019 comments about Bulgarian fans.", "description": "England fans in Sofia responded with disgust as home supporters targeted stars with racial abuse against Bulgaria", "authors": ["Jeremy Armstrong", "Image", "Andy Commins", "Daily Mirror", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Itvfootball Twitter", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20580712.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England-V-Bulgaria.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
