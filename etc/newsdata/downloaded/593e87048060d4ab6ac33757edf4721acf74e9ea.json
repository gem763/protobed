James Bond. Right, that\u2019s the first and last time you\u2019ll see that name in this Aston Martin story.\n\nNow, in the mind of our resident motoring miser Uncle Bob, there are three classes of car.\n\nOne is \u2018mainstream\u2019, which is your Fords, Kias, VWs and suchlike; two is \u2018premium\u2019, including brands like Audi, Mercedes, Jaguar, BMW; and three is \u2018thoroughbred\u2019, taking in names like Ferrari, Lamborghini, Bugatti and \u2013 strangely \u2013 Aston Martin.\n\nIt\u2019s strange because you can pick up a DB7, a proper Aston, for the price of a very mainstream Ford Focus.\n\nThe DB7 is the car that set Aston Martin on its path to the cars of the modern era, from the subsequent DB9 to today's DB11\n\nThis disconnect between high brand perception and low cost is very attractive to a rampant tightwad like Uncle Bob.\n\nIf, like Bob, you find it hard to imagine the prospect of a \u00a316,000 Aston Martin (see our Autotrader example below), you might think that now is the time to turn that secret DB7 fantasy into reality. You might never get another chance.\n\nA decent DB7 can be bought for under \u00a320,000. That is the same price as a Ford Focus Zetec.\n\nTry doing this with an Italian big-namer. Even the unloved Ferrari Mondial rarely drops below \u00a325,000.\n\nIt goes without saying that you shouldn't really compare the cost of new cars with old ones, or a sporting GT with a family hatchback, but the DB7 is cheap for an Aston Martin and the car world is littered with people kicking themselves that they didn't buy that X, Y or Z when it was that price.\n\nSo let\u2019s take a cold-eyed squintaroo at a lovely GT with great engines, a globally understood badge \u2013 and the cheapest route into thoroughbred motoring.\n\nA short history of the DB7\n\nThe DB7 was the first fruit of Ford\u2019s involvement in Aston Martin, which began in 1987 when the Blue Oval took a big chomp into AM\u2019s shares.\n\nSeven years and several zillion pounds of investment later, Aston\u2019s first \u2018modern\u2019 car appeared in the showrooms.\n\nModern gets speech marks there because, although the DB7 looked like a completely new car, there was more than a whiff of Jaguar XJS about its front-engined, rear-wheel drive undergarments.\n\nIf Jaguar\u2019s boardroom hadn\u2019t knocked back Ian Callum\u2019s design, the DB7 could just as easily have ended up a new Jag.\n\nIt didn\u2019t, though and the XJS got a new V8 engine, so the 1994 return of the DB name from its 22-year exile could be marked by an Aston-appropriate 335bhp 3.2 litre supercharged inline six, with a 5-speed manual gearbox or a 4-speed automatic gearbox.\n\nTwo years later, an open-topped (but also, remarkably, stiffer) Volante convertible was released. Its plusher suspension settings migrated over to the coup\u00e9 in the same year, along with airbags, new instruments and switchgear and longer front seat cushions.\n\nThe early 7\u2019s hard-to-mend composite bonnet went into the skip, and the Series 2 DB7 was born.\n\nIn 1999, a normally-aspirated Ford Cosworth 5.9-litre V12 engine was rammed into the DB7 to create the V12 Vantage\n\nIn 1999, a normally-aspirated Ford Cosworth 5.9-litre V12 engine (two V6s pulled together) was rammed into the DB7 to create the V12 Vantage.\n\nAlthough the 420bhp V12 motor was nearly twice the size of the six, its power advantage was relatively modest at 85bhp. It also had an extra 130kg to cart around, so there wasn\u2019t that much difference between the two cars on 0-60mph times, both of which began with a five.\n\nThe V12 was 20mph faster though, at 185mph.\n\nPerhaps more relevantly, it was also seen by aficionados as a more balanced all-rounder than the six. It had better cabin trim, bigger brakes and more driver foot room, both of which had been issues in the earlier car.\n\nThe transmission choices were now between a six-speed manual, or a five-speed automatic - one gear up in both cases on the old DB7.\n\nUnsurprisingly, there was a big buying shift away from the sixes once the twelves rolled into town.\n\nBy 2000, production of the six had stopped, the factory\u2019s attention having switched to souping up the big vee.\n\nThe outcome of that was the mesh-grilled, bonnet-vented, boot-spoilered 435bhp Vantage GT and the 420bhp GTA Touchtronic automatic of 2002.\n\nBoth of these limited-edition cars featured model-unique black oak wood interiors and improvements to the suspension, braking and aerodynamics. Even though the six-speed manual GT had shorter gearing, its 0-60mph time was practically unchanged at 5.0sec.\n\nTry as many DB7s as you can before you commit to buying one, says our Cash Cars writer Tony Middlehurst, and look for one that's been driven and looked after\n\nIn 2004 the V8-powered DB9 finally brought the curtain down on the DB7, boo.\n\nOr should that be hooray? DB7 running costs aren\u2019t low. They\u2019re not \u2018drive and forget\u2019 cars. There\u2019s an old-fashioned feel to the servicing requirements. For example, you\u2019ll need to change the oil in the rear axle, gearbox and differential every 30,000 miles.\n\nNot bothering is a short cut to disaster. If a problem pops up, you\u2019d best be ready and able to sort it quickly.\n\nYou don\u2019t really want a 100k-plus mile car, but nor would you want a low-miler that\u2019s just been left to gather dust in a sealed garage. Service histories have never been more important.\n\nTry as many DB7s as you can before you commit to buying one.\n\nRunning costs: Definitely more expensive than a Ford Focus An Aston Martin will not be cheap to run, expect fuel consumption to be 20mpg or less and insurance to be costly, although a limited mileage classic car policy should substantially reduce that. These costs may be the least of your problems, however, as maintaining rare luxury cars can cost a small fortune. Tyres and other consumables will be expensive, but if things go wrong life can get very pricey indeed. Budget at least \u00a31,500 per year to keep the car on the road and have a contingency fund for major work.

Finding a good independent Aston Martin specialist will make things cheaper than going to a dealer - and while that specialist will cost more than any old local garage, those in the know have the best chance of diagnosing and fixing problems swiftly and properly.\n\nIf you have \u00a320,000 burning a hole in your pocket, you could get busy with Ford's configurator to spec out a new Focus... or you could start trawling the classifieds for an Aston Martin DB7\n\nAston Martin DB7: Why buy one\n\nFor years, Aston followers have been saying that DB7 values were bottoming out.\n\nSo far, they\u2019ve been wrong. In 2005, a used DB7 was worth \u00a325,000 to \u00a330,000. Today they\u2019re grubbing around in the \u00a314,995 pool.\n\nOf the 7,000-odd DB7s made between 1994 and 2004, there are still about ,1600 running around on UK roads. That relative lack of rarity, plus the lingering effect of Ford\u2019s brand-depressing connection, is keeping values low.\n\nHowever, the number of UK-registered non-Vantage DB7 manuals went up in 2018, suggesting either that cars are being imported or that the ones that are already here are being restored, or both.\n\nEither way, these are signs of growing interest \u2013 and that should mean soon-to-be-growing values.\n\nThe trick to striking the Aston motherlode lies in identifying when the price curve is starting to head back up and buying something good before it does.\n\nThere\u2019s not that much price variation between the Coup\u00e9s and the Volante convertibles. More interestingly, the gap between the prices of the blown sixes and the V12s has narrowed significantly over the years, even though dynamically the V12 is a better car.\n\nFor a sub-100,000 mile 3.2 six you\u2019ll be looking at \u00a318,000 to \u00a320,000. For a V12-engined Vantage it\u2019s going to be \u00a321,000 and up. A fully-historied Vantage with under 50,000 miles will be around \u00a332,000 to \u00a333,000.\n\nYou can pay a lot more, of course. Uncle Bob practically choked on his cornflakes the other day when he saw a 200-mile DB7 Vantage from 2004, the last year of production, at \u00a395,000.\n\nThe limited edition Vantage GTs and GTAs from 2002 are rare by design. \u00a3167,000 new, it\u2019s thought that only 302 of them were made \u2013 190 GTs and 112 GTAs \u2013 and of that number, just 84 were right-hand drive.\n\nThese cars tend to have \u2018investment mileage\u2019, ie sometimes considerably less than 50,000. Bob found an \u201803 manual GT in Solway Grey with a tan/ocean blue interior and 16,000 miles at \u00a360,995, and an automatic \u201903 GTA in silver with exactly the same mileage at \u00a349,995.\n\nJust 99 coachbuilt DB7 Zagatos were built in 2004 and at current estimates you\u2019ll need over \u00a3350,000 to get one of them\n\nThe Zagato is the legendary Italian styling house's take on the DB7 - complete with the calling card double bubble roof line\n\nWant a real rare bird? Just 99 coachbuilt DB7 Zagatos were built in 2004, and you\u2019ll need over \u00a3350,000 to get one of them, but even that is common as muck compared to the Keswick LE, only ten of which (five coup\u00e9s, five Volantes) were built for the Lancaster group in 2002. Black on black with 19in wheels and no interior wood, this gangsta DB7 came with its own numbered IWC wristwatch.\n\nUncle Bob saw a 20,000-mile one auctioned off at the 2017 NEC Classic Show for just under \u00a349,000, which is unlikely to have lost the new owner any money two years down the line.\n\nSo what would Bob choose, a six or a twelve?\n\nWell, if he wasn\u2019t planning on driving it, an early manual six in the hope/expectation that it will be perceived as having more \u2018classic\u2019 appeal. For fun on the road, a late twelve.\n\nLight-coloured DB7s are more popular than dark ones, even though they\u2019re not quite so good at hiding the blood of the various henchmen you will be running over in the course of your espionage duties.\n\nWhatever DB7 he might buy, Bob would definitely be scoping out one of Aston\u2019s own \u2018pre-owned vehicle\u2019 warranties.\n\nAston Martin DB7: Bob\u2019s three to think on\n\nHere are three lipsmacking DB7s that Uncle Bob has tracked down. Get in quick before he presses the BIN button. Not that red one under the gearknob though. Never touch that.\n\nA private seller in the Surrey stockbroker belt has this 121,000 mile DB7 for sale at \u00a316,000 on Autotrader\n\n2003, DB7 Vantage V12, \u00a316,000, on Autotrader\n\nThe cheapest V12 Vantage we could find, this 121,000-mile 2003 automatic in Homewood Blue is being sold for age reasons (the owner, not the car). The only advisory on the March 2019 MOT was an edge-worn back tyre, so it will probably need setting up on the wheel aligner. Tempting though.\n\nThis 67,000-mile 3.2 auto hasn\u2019t been used much, if at all, in the last couple of years and is for sale by a dealer on eBay\n\n1998, DB7 3.2, \u00a319,999, on eBay\n\nIn British Racing Green with piped parchment hide this 67,000-mile 3.2 auto hasn\u2019t been used much, if at all, in the last couple of years. Its MOT expired in March 2017, but the seller will put a new ticket on it for the new owner. With 14 stamps in the book and a hefty wodge of invoices you wouldn't expect it to fail \u2013 or to lose value.\n\nIt's got 34,000 miles and looks spotless in and out but the price tag is \u00a335,995 for this one owner DB7 convertible for sale on Pistonheads\n\n2002, DB7 Vantage V12 Volante, \u00a335,995, on Pistonheads\n\nAt 34,000 miles and spotless inside and out, this one-owner Sage Green with Parchment leather convertible with the 5-speed auto box just needs a bespoke registration to pass for a much younger car. Lovely.\n\nWhat to watch out for if you buy a DB7\n\nBodywork & interior\n\nGiven that DB7s have now been around for a quarter of a century, you won\u2019t be surprised to hear that rust can be an issue.\n\nYou might be more surprised to learn that later DBs weren\u2019t as well protected as earlier ones, so don\u2019t let your fear ramp up in proportion to a car\u2019s age.\n\nWhere might you get it? In the floorpan, wheelarches, the sill ends before the rear arches, the front suspension and top mounts, the bulkhead behind those mounts, the jacking points, and the suspension radius arms.\n\nSome of the body panels aren\u2019t made of regular steel, so accident repairs won't be cheap and it\u2019s important to nip any stone chips in the bud.\n\nInside, there\u2019s not as much kit as you might think, especially on earlier cars. Still, not having an obsolete built-in satnav isn\u2019t a bad thing, and most of us can surely live without electrically folding door mirrors.\n\nIt does have electric windows, obviously, though you might wonder whether it really is so obvious if the combined window motor and regulator conks out and you\u2019re presented with a four-figure bill to fix it.\n\nAnother modern convenience feature that is known for inconveniently conking out on DB7s is the air-conditioning, either through leaks or \u2013 much more expensively \u2013 the evaporator behind the dashboard. A replacement windscreen fitted to any standard below perfect will create more leaks.\n\nSeat latches break, but the natural cabin materials are generally durable, as is the cloth Volante roof, but check that the rear three-quarter panel isn\u2019t worn. Also ensure that any Volante you\u2019re thinking of buying has its tonneau cover to protect the workings of the hood when it\u2019s down.\n\nThe Aston Martin DB7 Volante convertible's roof has proved pretty durable but do check it out and also look for a tonneau cover to protect it when down\n\nEngine & transmission\n\nSix-cylinder cars could be ordered with a Driving Dynamics option pack featuring a different exhaust and a bigger intercooler. A 'Works Prepared' badge under the bonnet signifies that your car has it.\n\nThe six is famous for cracking its exhaust manifold. Timing chain tensioner failure (flagged up by a rattly chain) is catastrophic, and you also need to check the engine oil and gearbox coolers for leaks.\n\nSuperchargers whine by definition, but if the noise seems excessive it may be due for a change of oil and coolant. Quite a few early manuals had their noisy gearboxes and diffs replaced under warranty: it would be good to see that in the service history.\n\nAlthough you\u2019ll enjoy better performance with the six-speed manual gearbox, you might not be quite so keen on the change quality. The 2000-on sequential-shift Touchtronic system was a popular choice over both the manual and the original automatic.\n\nThe V12\u2019s drivetrain has an excellent reputation for reliability but there are a couple of areas to keep an eye on. Poor running could be down to a fritzing coil pack or, if it\u2019s mainly at lower speeds, faulty injectors delivering too much fuel.\n\nCooling is hugely important on such a big, tightly-fitting engine. The V12\u2019s hoses are known for collapsing and allowing coolant to leak into the gearbox, so you\u2019ll want to see that your prospective V12\u2019s system has been overhauled. The radiator thermostats go too.\n\nThe DB9 that followed the DB7 shows how Aston Martin's styling developed on a theme\n\nSuspension & steering\n\nThere are few concerns about the DB7\u2019s steering but it\u2019s never a bad idea to check the pipes and connections for dryness.\n\nStandard suspension bushes do perish over time, which is normal for any car, but the ones on the DB7 front top-mount bushes go west more quickly.\n\nWheels, tyres & brakes\n\nYou\u2019ll need to polish up your parking skills if your DB7 has its original alloys as they\u2019re vulnerable to kerb damage. Peeling lacquer is another common issue.\n\nDB7s are very fussy when it comes to wheel alignment. Get that wrong and the results will be rapid tyre wear (not necessarily in an easily spottable place) and potentially some pulling to the left.\n\nIn general, factory brakes on all models are good, but the discs can warp.", "description": "The DB7 ushered in a new era for Aston Martin.
