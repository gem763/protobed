Some of the patients testified that Johnson and Ulbrich performed the surgeries together, although many didn't even know Ulbrich's name.\n\nIn court, the defense tried to tear down witness testimony by showing a declaration that they had signed for Ulrich to perform the procedure, a Fox 5 video shows.\n\nThe trio was busted after in summer 2016, a patient tried to report Johnson to the Georgia Composite Medical Board as they argued about surgery, because 'the way he spoke with her seemed unprofessional'.\n\nThe body can only sanction doctors who are licensed so the case was referred to police.\n\nAmid a criminal investigation, more patients came forward against the former doctor who they claim Williams illegally introduced and continually referred to as 'Dr. Johnson'.\n\nJohnson had his license suspended two years prior to that after being convicted of Medicaid fraud, conspiracy to defraud the state, and practicing medicine without a license.\n\nUlbrich first had his medical license suspended in 2010 after 10 years of sexual misconduct and exploitation of patients, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. He returned to practicing in 2011 and his probation was lifted 2015.\n\nIn 2017, Ulbrich failed a polygraph when asked about sexual encounters with current and former patients. The Georgia Composite Medical Board said he admitted to sexual contact with four patients and his licence was suspended indefinitely.\n\nUlbrich was convicted on 55 counts Friday, alongside Johnson on 62 felony counts, including racketeering and theft by deception.\n\nWilliams was found guilty of 11 felony counts of theft and practicing medicine without a license.\n\n'The jurors in this case gave up three weeks of their lives so that justice could be done,' Senior Assistant District Attorney Jason Marbutt said. 'I applaud their diligence, and I\u2019m thankful that the defendants will no longer be able to peddle the lie that Nathaniel Johnson is a doctor.'\n\nBut Ulbrich's attorney said she was 'saddened by the verdict in this case and will be filing an appeal'.\n\n'I think the record clearly reflects that there was no racketeering, no theft by deception and Dr. Ulbrich, at all times during these procedures, had a license and all patients knew he was performing procedures,' Michelle Smith insisted.\n\nThe sentencing is scheduled for December 4.", "description": "Some patients at Hello Beautiful in Georgia said in the trial where Nathaniel Johnson III, Peter Ulbrich and Shannon Williams were convicted Friday, that they had 'disfiguring or unhappy results'.", "authors": ["Leah Simpson For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/14/20330652-0-image-a-32_1572360625922.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
