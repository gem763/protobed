What if They're Wrong?", "language": "en", "text": "Flo and Clue, two popular period-tracking apps, recently introduced health tools that evaluate a woman\u2019s risk for the hormonal imbalance known as polycystic ovary syndrome.\n\nIn September alone, more than 636,000 women completed the Flo health assessments, said the app\u2019s developer, Flo Health. The app then recommended that 240,000 of those women, or about 38%, ask their doctors about the hormonal disorder. (BioWink, the developer of Clue, declined to provide similar usage statistics.)\n\nBut what many women who used the Flo and Clue health tools may not have known is that the apps did not conduct high-level clinical studies to determine the accuracy of their health risk assessments or the potential for unintended consequences such as overdiagnosis. As a result, some experts said, the new tools could lead some women to be labeled with a hormonal imbalance they did not have or that may have no significant repercussions for their health.\n\n\u201cYou could be making a lot of people concerned they have a problem that they don\u2019t know will have absolutely no clinical consequences for them,\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Doust, a professor of clinical epidemiology at Bond University in Queensland, Australia, who has studied polycystic ovary syndrome, which is known as PCOS.\n\nFlo\u2019s and Clue\u2019s health assessments are part of a broader shift in digital medicine. Health tracking apps have for years helped people collect and chart data on their heart rates, moods, sleep patterns and menstrual cycles. But now some of these apps are going further by using that data to predict an individual\u2019s risk for problems like heart conditions. In other words, they are moving from simply quantifying consumers\u2019 health data to medicalizing it.\n\nWhile some of the apps\u2019 new evaluation tools may be useful and helpful, determining whether they are accurate can be difficult. Of the several hundred thousand health apps available globally in major app stores, most lack high-level evidence on their outcomes, according to a recent study in Nature Digital Medicine. And as long as consumer health apps make vague health promises \u2014 like improved well-being \u2014 and do not claim to diagnose or treat a disease, they are not typically required to submit effectiveness evidence for vetting by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly become confusing as a consumer if you go onto these app marketplaces and these apps are making claims about helping you learn about mental health, PCOS, heart disease, diabetes,\u201d said Dr. John Torous, director of the digital psychiatry division at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, one of the authors of the Nature study. \u201cDo we know this helps or it doesn\u2019t help?\u201d\n\nFlo, which has more than 30 million active monthly users, and Clue, with more than 12 million, have good intentions. Their developers each said they had worked with medical experts to develop the assessments and had based them on international medical guidelines for identifying PCOS. The apps also include prominent disclaimers saying that their assessments for PCOS should not be construed as diagnoses.\n\nBut in a recent news release, Flo described its service as a \u201cdigital, pre-diagnostic tool\u201d to help women \u201cdiscover if they have PCOS and also bring peace of mind to others who may suspect they have it.\u201d Clue said its \u201cprobabilistic statistical model\u201d for the hormonal imbalance offered a \u201csmart assessment that can be shared with doctors.\u201d\n\nOne woman, a product manager in the San Francisco Bay Area interviewed by The New York Times who used Flo, said it gave her more information about PCOS than her doctor had. But Sasha O\u2019Marra, a copywriter in Toronto who tried a beta version of Flo\u2019s health risk feature in July, said she found the assessment irresponsible.\n\nThe app said O\u2019Marra\u2019s symptoms \u2014 acne and menstrual cycle changes \u2014 \u201cmay indicate a hormonal imbalance which is probably a manifestation of PCOS.\u201d She took the company to task on Twitter, explaining that her period had changed because she had just changed birth control pills.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very concerning to me,\u201d O\u2019Marra said in an interview. \u201cTelling people they might have something like PCOS without understanding the context behind their symptoms is a slippery slope.\u201d\n\nThe company responded on Twitter: \u201cHere at Flo, we use medically approved algorithms.\u201d It explained that its algorithm considered multiple factors. \u201cIf some symptoms match, we encourage a user to visit a doctor just to make sure that everything is fine.\u201d", "description": "Flo and Clue, two popular period-tracking apps, recently introduced health tools that evaluate a woman's risk for the hormonal imbalance known as polycystic ovary syndrome.In September alone, more than 636,000 women completed the Flo health assessments, said the app's developer, Flo Health.
