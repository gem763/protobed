Merkel\u2019s CDU and its coalition partner, the left-wing Social Democrats (SPD) already saw their formerly safe lead in Saxony and Brandenburg eroded last month by the rise of the AfD.\n\nAlso on rt.com Merkel and allies lose votes but hang on in German elections as AfD surges\n\nThe AfD, which surged from nothing into third place in 2017\u2019s federal elections, took 23.8 percent of the vote in Thuringia, according to exit polls released Sunday. Merkel\u2019s CDU took 22.5 percent. The left-wing Linke won the state, taking 29.7 percent of the vote.\n\nAt the back of the pack, the SPD took 8.5 percent, while the Greens took 5.4.\n\nFor the AfD, pipping the CDU into second place is a major coup, considering the party only managed to win 10 percent in the last election in 2014. Back then, the CDU was the overall winner, with 33.5 percent, though Linke, the SPD, and the Greens would band together to form a coalition government.\n\nFor the CDU and SPD, Sunday\u2019s results are the worst since reunification three decades ago.\n\nThey dominated West-German politics for decades: today, a combined coalition of CDU, SPD, Greens + FDP wouldn\u2019t even manage to reach a majority in #Thuringia!\n\n30 years after the wall fell, far-left LINKE and far-right AfD win more than 50% of the seats. pic.twitter.com/VKdegLsXMs \u2014 Henrik Enderlein (@henrikenderlein) October 27, 2019\n\nThuringia is a small state with a population of 2.1 million that used to be part of the Eastern Bloc.\n\nThough the CDU and SPD remain in power in the west of the country, the ruling centrists have seen their support eviscerated in the east, pointing to a culture clash of sorts between both sides of the old Cold War-era border. The east remains relatively disadvantaged compared to the west, and the AfD has courted the region\u2019s electorate by opposing the closure of coal mines and calling for urban regeneration.\n\nLinke too has positioned itself as a champion of the working class, promising increased social spending, a raised minimum wage, and tax increases on the wealthy.\n\nOpposition to Merkel\u2019s \u2018open door\u2019 immigration policies saw the AfD initially surge in popularity, after the chancellor welcomed more than a million migrants to Germany in 2015. Since then, the party has found support in the east, where public opinion against immigration is strongest.\n\nAnd, while Germany\u2019s green party enjoyed strong support in this summer\u2019s European elections, its share of the vote remained stagnant in Thuringia, suggesting that the environmentalism currently in vogue in the west finds few fans in poorer parts of the country.\n\nAlso on rt.com 30yrs & billions of euros later: Germany marks Fall of the Wall, but did reunification bring the promised \u2018blossoming landscapes\u2019?\n\n\u201cThuringians have voted for the Wende 2.0,\u201d Bjoern Hoecke, the AfD's leader in the state, said on Sunday. \u201cThis is a clear sign that a large part of Thuringia says: This can't go on. We need renewal \u2013 this should be taken seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cWende\u201d is a German word meaning \u201cturnaround,\u201d and was used to describe the collapse of East Germany three deacdes ago. AfD leaders have repeatedly used the phrase on the campaign trail in eastern states, suggesting that the demise of Merkel\u2019s centrism is every bit the revolution the fall of communism was.\n\nWith the center gutted and the AfD and Linke taking a majority of the vote, there is little in common between both parties, save for a more friendly attitude to relations with Russia than Merkel\u2019s. Both are currently enjoying more support than would have been imaginable in 2014, though every single mainstream German party has ruled out working with the AfD.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
