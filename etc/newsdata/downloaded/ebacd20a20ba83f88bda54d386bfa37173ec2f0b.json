This is a real danger. This event will last probably through Friday,\u201d Roth said. \u201cIt\u2019s a critical fire danger.\u201d\n\nThe company cut off electricity to more than 730,000 homes and workplaces in northern California earlier this month to try to reduce wildfire risks posed by extremely windy and dry weather.\n\nThe bankrupt Californian power producer said it had crews, equipment, vehicles and aircraft on standby to conduct the shutoffs and subsequent inspections, repairs and power restoration.\n\nIn some areas, the company said it has reduced the scope of impact as it was able to sectionalize certain lines.\n\nIn May, state fire investigators determined that PG&E transmission lines caused the deadliest and most destructive wildfire on record in California, last year\u2019s wind-driven Camp Fire that killed 85 people in and around the town of Paradise.\n\nFILE PHOTO: PG&E crew work on power lines to repair damage caused by the Camp Fire in Paradise, California, U.S. November 21, 2018. REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage/File Photo\n\nCal Fire likewise concluded that PG&E power lines had sparked a 2017 flurry of wildfires that swept California\u2019s wine country north of San Francisco Bay.\n\nThe company, whose handling of recent power outages has been criticized over insufficient communication with customers, sent out 48-hour advance notifications on Monday informing customers it may be proactively turning power off for safety.\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy in January, citing potential civil liabilities in excess of $30 billion from the fires.", "description": "Thousands of homes and businesses in California were in the dark on Wednesday as Pacific Gas & Electric turned off power in parts of 15 counties as a preventive measure against wildfires.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444405220&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0N2", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
