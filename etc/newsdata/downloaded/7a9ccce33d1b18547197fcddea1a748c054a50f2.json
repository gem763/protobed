From the horrific attack on a mosque in Christ Church, New Zealand, to the assault on a synagogue in the German city of Halle, the movement often follows the same horrific script\u2014live-streaming the carnage, disseminating a manifesto, comments full of tongue-in-cheek internet references\u2014and governments are scrambling to counter this threat.\n\nBut U.S. laws have a special problem, what might be called a \u201cterror gap\u201d between \u201cforeign\u201d and \u201cdomestic\u201d terror organizations.\n\nWhile the arrests of Smith and Climo mark a new level of initiative by the federal government, there is still much more to be done. What allows far-right terrorist groups to thrive in the U.S. is a legal double standard that binds the hands of even the most proactive members of law enforcement.\n\nThis double standard is exemplified by groups like Atomwaffen, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group with major influence in the far-right online community. A video this past May shows people with Atomwaffen patches on their arms carrying out paramilitary drills with assault rifles. They then burn the flags of Israel, the United Nations, the Gadsden \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d snake, the gay pride rainbow, Black Lives Matter, the police-supporting Thin Blue Line\u2014designating any and all as enemies. If it weren\u2019t for the Atomwaffen branding, you\u2019d think you were watching footage of an ISIS training camp on American soil.\n\nNow combine this militancy with a widely aimed recruitment operation. Messages on Telegram, the far-right\u2019s current online hub, recruit on behalf of Atomwaffen, directing prospects to different email addresses of region-specific chapters across the US, Europe, South America, and Australia.\n\nMinding its popularity, it\u2019s not surprising to see that Atomwaffen has inspired other neo-Nazis to launch offshoot chapters or like-minded groups across the globe, such as Feuerkrieg Division, a growing neo-Nazi organization which both Climo and Smith were associated with.\n\n\u201c While actual acts of domestic terrorism\u2014killing, assaulting, harassing\u2014are obvious crimes, being a member of domestic terrorist organizations is not. \u201d\n\nMedia by such groups often advocate for terrorism and praise far-right attackers, including the Halle shooter and Pittsburgh synagogue shooter Robert Bowers.\n\nThis type of propaganda is a major lifeblood to the far-right community, just as it is for any extremist group or movement\u2014no terrorist organization can grow without it.\n\nThe world witnessed the power of media with the rise of ISIS, leading governments to counter propagandists with the same urgency as fighters or financiers.\n\nThat is precisely why last October, a 34-year-old man named Ashraf Al Safoo was arrested for his work with Khattab Media Foundation, a prominent ISIS-linked media group that issued scores of threats and incitements against elections, public events, and other targets. Safoo himself never killed or planned to kill anyone, but the media he created helped amplify ISIS\u2019 dangerous message, making him no less guilty of aiding the group.\n\nTaking note of Safoo\u2019s story, you might ask yourself how groups like Atomwaffen or Feuerkrieg Division can run their threat propaganda machines\u2014let alone carry out paramilitary drills with the objective of overthrowing the U.S. government\u2014with little to no interference. The answer is simple: what they do is, for the most part, not illegal.\n\n\u201c The far-right community has grown dramatically in the last year, with new waves of attacks and uninterrupted online spaces that inspire them\u2014a very similar condition to that of ISIS shortly before it established its so-called Caliphate. \u201d\n\nThe reason the U.S. government can arrest ISIS recruiters or media workers like Safoo and others is because the groups they support are Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs), making their activities grounds for, in the language of court documents, \u201cconspiracy to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization.\u201d To support or be a member of an FTO in any capacity is a crime.\n\nWhile actual acts of domestic terrorism\u2014killing, assaulting, harassing\u2014are obvious crimes, being a member of domestic terrorist organizations like Atomwaffen or Feuerkrieg Division in and of itself is not, despite their blatantly stated goals to spark collapse of the U.S. through terrorism.\n\nThe very phrase \u201cdomestic terrorist group\u201d is in many ways legally meaningless. As assistant FBI Director Michael McGarrity explained before the House Homeland Security Committee in May: \u201cA white supremacist organization is an ideology, it's a belief. But they're not designated as a terrorist organization.\u201d\n\nThis lack of adequate domestic terror laws too often leaves far-right terrorist propaganda, incitement, and recruitment messages under the classification of hate speech, something protected under the First Amendment. A group like Atomwaffen, which bluntly and loudly states its goals for violence, is a perfect example of why this makes for a domestic security crisis.\n\nNoting this problem, I\u2019d like to echo the yet small but growing voices of legislators and others seeking to end this double standard in how we protect our nation from terrorism. The world has made immense progress against ISIS online and on the ground, in no small part due to the clear-cut laws against promoting it, whether financially, militarily, through its incitement propaganda machine.\n\nThat said, the U.S. legal system shouldn\u2019t have to wait until the brink of an attack\u2014or, as it too often does, the aftermath of one\u2014to prosecute terrorists like Climo or Smith.\n\nMembership of a group like Atomwaffen should bear all the same legal weight as ISIS, al Qaeda, or any other terrorist organization we don\u2019t flinch at pursuing.\n\nAny such list of designations should be regularly updated to address the rapidly changing landscape of groups that either form or, under pressure, dissolve only to reemerge under different names.\n\nSuch laws will make it immensely clearer to these far-right organizations and the platforms hosting them that they cannot remain online.\n\nI don\u2019t embrace such measures lightly. I\u2019ve been very vocal throughout my counter-terrorism career speaking out against overreaching measures by the government, whether attempting to regulating encrypted messenger services or other ill-guided policies.\n\nBut the far-right community has grown dramatically in the last year, with new waves of attacks and uninterrupted online spaces that inspire them\u2014a very similar condition to that of ISIS shortly before it established its so-called Caliphate. This is a critical moment for the U.S. government to prove if it is capable of learning from history. While terrorist legislation will not be a silver bullet to stop the threat of attacks by neo-Nazis and white supremacists, it would mark a major step in the right direction.\n\nAs it\u2019s increasingly said these days, \"Terrorism is terrorism.\u201d So why perpetuate the legal double standard?", "description": "What allows far-right terrorist groups to thrive in the U.S. is a legal double standard that binds the hands of even the most proactive members of law enforcement.", "authors": ["Rita Katz"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2700,w_4800,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571696130/191021-Katz-terror-embed-1_wv1jxu", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
