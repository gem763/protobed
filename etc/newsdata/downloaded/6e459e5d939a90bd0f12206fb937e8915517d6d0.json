In the UK, children can get married at 16 if they have parental consent, despite the fact the United Nations defines any marital union under the age of 18 as child marriage.\n\nThe social enterprise, which runs a service where women can donate, sell or buy wedding dresses and up to two thirds of sales go to girls in need, also ran a survey which revealed that 65% of British people are unaware of this law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo really hit the point home, the company worked with eight young British girls to create a photo series to further illustrate the issue.\n\n\u2018Even in modern Britain, there are lots of different factors that can put a child at risk of being forced into an early marriage, including poverty, family traditions, customary or religious laws that promote the practice, and an inadequate legislative framework\u2019 (Picture: Brides do Good)\n\n\u2018When people hear about child marriage in developing countries they are rightly shocked, yet from our recent survey results it is clear that the majority of people have absolutely no idea it is happening in the UK too,\u2019 said founder of Brides do Good, Chantal Khoueiry.\n\n\u2018This isn\u2019t surprising considering that in the UK there is a severe lack of data on child marriage cases, due to there being no official form of reporting in place. We hope that the data we have gathered will act as a step forward in helping to raise awareness of this unjust and barbaric act.\n\n\u2018Even in modern Britain, there are lots of different factors that can put a child at risk of being forced into an early marriage, including poverty, family traditions, customary or religious laws that promote the practice, and an inadequate legislative framework.\n\n\u2018Because of these factors, for many children in the UK marriage is forced upon them \u2013 robbing them of their childhood, education, health and freedom.\u2019\n\nIn the UK, girls can marry at age 16 with their parents\u2019 consent (Picture: Brides do Good)\n\nEvery year, 12 million girls under the age of 18 get married across the globe (Picture: Brides do Good)\n\nThe enterprise has also launched a petition to change legislation around child marriage (Picture: Brides do Good)\n\nBrides do Good has also launched a petition to change current legislation and raise the minimum age to 18 in the UK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe goal is only set to 100 signatures so far, but a Brides do Good representative told Metro.co.uk that the aim is to run the campaign over four months (so the total is likely to change over time).\n\nChantal added: \u2018As part of the #OnlyAGirl campaign, we wanted to create a series of emotive images which would allow us to highlight the innocence of young girls, whilst capturing the hearts of the nation.\n\n\u2018We encourage everyone who feels emotionally impacted by these images to sign our petition, which calls for the government to address the current age legislations for marriage in the UK \u2013 so that together we can end child marriage.\n\n\u2018If children under the age of 18 are not mature enough to vote, drink, smoke, or gamble in the UK \u2013 then why can they marry?\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s a good question.\n\nMORE: The Annual Toilet Paper Wedding Dress Contest crowns its winner\n\nMORE: Bride spends \u00a317,000 on Disney-themed wedding after husband proposes at Disney World\n\nMORE: Bride is savagely mocked for engagement ring that looks like \u2018a squirt of mayo\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Brides do Good releases survey results that reveal 65% of Brits are unaware that children under 18 can get married with parental consent.", "authors": ["Almara Abgarian"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ONLYAGIRL-CAMPAIGN-8-5074_1570797185.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
