But the new document describes a call to police from Jeremy Bamber timed at \u201capprox 3.37am\u201d.\n\nHis legal team argue it shows Bamber could not have made the 3.26am call from the farm and returned to his home 3.5 miles away in Goldhanger to make the second call.\n\n(Image: Collect)\n\nThe \u201c3.37am\u201d note came from an interview with a PC Myall, of Essex Police, during the Dickinson Inquiry into the force\u2019s handling of the case after Bamber\u2019s conviction in November 1986.\n\nThe note was found by Bamber among thousands of police documents released to him in 2011.\n\nPC Myall is noted as telling Dickinson: \u201cWe received a telephone call at the P.Stn (Police Station, Witham).\n\n\"The officer (PC West) at CD Control (Chelmsford) was on the phone and told us that he was relating information to us and still had the informant (Jeremy Bamber) on the other telephone.\u201d\n\n(Image: David Thorpe/ANL/REX)\n\nThe trial judge had instructed the jury to disregard Bamber\u2019s claims that he had called police from his home at 3.36am.\n\nAnd prosecutors told the trial Bamber had invented the call from Nevill to lay the blame on schizophrenic Sheila, known as Bambi when she worked as a model.\n\nBamber was convicted by a 10-2 majority of murdering his family to claim a \u00a3436,000 inheritance.\n\nHe was initially sentenced to five life sentences, to serve a minimum 25 years, but that was increased to a whole life tariff in 1994.\n\nThe Mirror revealed in 2010 how lost phone logs showed it was Nevill who called police at 3.26am.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nA further record submitted to the Criminal Case Review Commission in 2010 showed a 3.36am call to police from Jeremy Bamber.\n\nBut the CCRC ruled the 3.36am call was noted in error and that there was just one call, from Jeremy not Nevill, made at 3.26am from White House Farm scene.\n\nThe new \u201c3.37am\u201d note is said to prove the existence of the second call.\n\nITV last week announced a drama about the murders next year, with Freddie Fox as Bamber, who is in Wakefield jail, West Yorkshire.\n\nBamber was famously pictured with girlfriend Julie Mugford, 21, struggling to contain his grief walking behind his parents\u2019 coffins at their funeral.\n\nAfter Julie found he had cheated on her, she told police Bamber had talked of hiring a hitman to kill his parents.\n\nA blood-stained silencer was also found at the farm by Bamber\u2019s cousin.\n\nBamber\u2019s team say they now have evidence of two silencers examined by police, both believed to contain blood that could belong to Sheila or now-deceased cousin Robert Boutflour.\n\nThey say a forensic report has been given to the CPS about this evidence. Bamber believes police always had evidence that would have cleared him, but failed to disclose it at his trial, his first appeal in 1989 or second in 2002.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2011, Bamber made three CCRC submissions in a failed attempt to get his case back to the Court of Appeal. He has also made appeals against his whole life tariff.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nEssex Police said: \u201cThere has never been anything to suggest that he was wrongly convicted.\u201d But Bamber\u2019s lawyer is now hopeful of a new appeal.\n\nMr Newby said: \u201cThe phone call information is consistent with what Jeremy Bamber always said. It is part of a package of evidence that should lead to a positive review for Jeremy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say when we go back to the CCRC we will have a pretty strong package which we hope they will refer to the Court of Appeal. We hope we will get it across the line.\n\n\u201cIf we do, it is probably this country\u2019s greatest ever miscarriage of justice.\u201d\n\nThe case against\n\nThe prosecution said Bamber, then 24, had cycled to White House Farm and got in via an insecure window before murdering his family.\n\nGirlfriend Julie Mugford said Bamber had planned the killings and had phoned her, saying: \u201cTonight\u2019s the night.\u201d\n\nA silencer found three days later had Sheila\u2019s blood inside. Prosecutors said she could hardly have put it back in the cupboard if she had lready killed herself with it.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The mass killer was jailed for shooting parents Nevill and June, model sister Sheila \u201cBambi\u201d Caffell, and her six-year-old twin sons Daniel and Nicholas", "authors": ["Matthew Young", "Image", "Pa", "Collect Unknown", "Collect", "David Thorpe Anl Rex", "Itv", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13291376.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jeremy-Bamber-1986.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
