It will probably be comparable to the first protest (against gay marriage) in 2012, with around 100,000 people,\u201d said Pascale Moriniere, president of the Association of Catholic Families (AFC).\n\nHer group and others say they have distributed some three million flyers against the law in recent weeks.\n\nBut analysts say French society has become more acceptive of non-traditional families since 2012, noting for example a vote by National Assembly lawmakers last week to officially recognise the parenthood of a couple who had twins in the US via a surrogate.\n\nAn Ifop poll in September found that 68 percent approved IVF and other medically assisted procreation (MAP) for single women, and 65 percent for lesbian couples.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict what will happen Sunday but public opinion is much less divided on MAP than on gay marriage,\u201d Frederic Dabi, an Ifop director, told AFP.\n\nGerard Larcher, the right-wing president of the Senate who protested against the gay marriage law six years ago, is not expected to attend the rally Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe people demonstrating will be doing it more out of moral conviction, a sense of duty, rather than to try to make the government back down,\u201d said Yann Raison de Cleuziou, a sociologist who has studied the conservative Catholic movement against the family reforms.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Thousands of people prepared to descend on Paris on Sunday to protest a government plan to let single women and lesbians become", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/41f327_poll-68-percent-french-people-approved-ivf-medically-assisted-procreation-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
