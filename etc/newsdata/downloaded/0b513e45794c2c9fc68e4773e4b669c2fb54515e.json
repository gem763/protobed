It is known for hiring inexperienced pilots \u2014 most of them recent graduates of its own academy \u2014 and for paying them little and working them hard.\"\n\nThe captain, an Indian national named Bhavye Suneja, 31, was put in charge of piloting the 737 sooner than he would have been at \"a more conventional airline,\" Langewiesche wrote. And once that 737 Max was having issues, the Lion Air crew didn't mitigate the failures, the article said.\n\nA few other bizarre happenings communicated Suneja's lack of experience \u2014 for instance, he told air-traffic control that he didn't know the plane's altitude, the report said.\n\nRead more: Boeing is crowding its employee parking lot with undelivered 737 Max jets, and the company says that's part of its 'inventory-management plan'\n\nThe report also argued that the pilots directing Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which crashed on March 10, had similarly questionable instincts in controlling the 737 Max.\n\nBusiness Insider reported in March that the copilot of that flight had just 200 hours of flight experience.\n\nGrounded Boeing 737 Max planes in Seattle. REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson\n\nRoss Aimer, CEO of the airline consulting and legal firm Aero Consulting Experts, previously told Business Insider that 200 hours \"is extremely low\" and that \"in an emergency, it becomes a problem.\"\n\n\"If you have a complicated airplane and you basically put a student pilot in there, that's not a good thing,\" Aimer added. \"Even if the guy in the left seat has so much experience, if you have so much imbalance of experience, that can be a problem.\"\n\nAfter a heady analysis of the pilots' actions, Langewiesche, a former pilot, wrote that these crashes showed \"a textbook failure of airmanship.\"\n\n\"In broad daylight, these pilots couldn't decipher a variant of a simple runaway trim, and they ended up flying too fast at low altitude, neglecting to throttle back and leading their passengers over an aerodynamic edge into oblivion,\" he wrote.\n\nThe worrisome conclusion to be drawn from this is that \"thousands of similar crews\" are flying passengers worldwide, he wrote \u2014 and that unusual conditions could lead to a fatal ending.", "description": "The Boeing 737 Max has been grounded worldwide for months after two fatal crashes.
