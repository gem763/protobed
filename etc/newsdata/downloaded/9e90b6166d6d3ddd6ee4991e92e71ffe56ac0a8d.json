The impact will become clear in 2020, Santander said.\n\nThe Spanish bank is not the only one to face a major challenge from PPI mis-selling.\n\nLast week, Barclays said it had taken a \u00a31.4 billion hit from the scandal, as the deadline passed at the end of August.\n\nThe bank posted a \u00a3292 million net loss, down from a \u00a31 billion net profit in the same period last year.\n\nSantander saw its best mortgage growth since the years immediately after the financial crash, with net mortgages up \u00a33.6 billion, while deposits grew by \u00a34.2 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, the bank said it had built up enough liquid assets to weather Brexit uncertainty.\n\nHowever its outlook for the year, which is largely unchanged, relies on Britain leaving in an 'orderly' way.\n\n'The uncertain economic environment looks set to continue for some time, reinforcing our longstanding prudent approach to risk. We are delivering excellent customer experience while taking decisive steps to improve our efficiency and competitiveness,' Mr Bostock said.\n\n'We delivered our strongest quarterly net mortgage growth in almost 10 years, driven by a focus on customer service and retention.\n\n'We have also increased customer deposits across the business, with further improvement in customer loyalty.'", "description": "Pre-tax profits at Santander UK fell 43 per cent to \u00a3785million, as the bank took a \u00a3169million charge from PPI.", "authors": ["Press Association", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
