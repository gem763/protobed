It\u2019s designed to offer more than just individual livestreamers as entertainment, and also touts its lack of ads. It\u2019s also backed by 20th Century Fox (and now its new owners, Disney), which invested $100 million in the platform last year and promised to bring live music and sports to it exclusively. The platform currently features shows from Fox Sports, ESPN, and Riot Games.\n\nIn an effort to give Caffeine a leg-up on its competitors, it\u2019s signed rapper and esports investor Offset to help create some of its content. Offset, who\u2019s an avid gamer himself, will stream two shows: one in which he plays his favorite games, and another called Bet with Set, where he\u2019ll compete with celebrity guests in some sort of undisclosed challenges. Will thumbscrews be involved? That\u2019d get me to watch.\n\nOffset, of course, was full of praise for Caffeine, saying in a statement: \u201cWith Caffeine, I can create my content in an organic way that lets me make real connections with my community\u2026 Caffeine allows me to be myself so I\u2019m trying to reach these kids to show them that everybody is a part of a team and we\u2019re all one.\u201d\n\nThe streaming sites are still fighting over who can draw the biggest eyeballs. Twitch is still the entrenched giant, who\u2019s gone all in on gaming and IRL audiences and who\u2019s still accruing the most number of hours watched. Still, the site has struggled both with breaking out of its reputation as a gaming-only site, but also because streamers frequently face an uphill battle getting paid.\n\nMixer has, at least, shown the presence to sign on some big names in streaming, including Ninja and, most recently, Shroud. Streamlabs recently reported that Mixer\u2019s total number of hours streamed increased by 188 percent in the last quarter, and the number of unique channels almost doubled. Whether anyone\u2019s watching isn\u2019t necessarily the issue \u2014 it still means that more people were at least curious enough about Mixer to give it a try.\n\nIts hard to see, given how long some of these other sites have been around, what a new one like Caffeine would be able to do. How many livestreaming sites are viewers even going to want to split their time between?\n\nStill, playing devil\u2019s advocate, there might be some kind of a space for a streaming service that isn\u2019t so deeply centered on watching other people play video games. According to Limelight\u2019s recently published \u201cState of Online Video,\u201d this is one of the least popular categories of online video, with more popular categories being movies, tv shows, and \u201cprofessionally produced video content.\u201d So a site that successfully combines gaming livestreams with said professionally produced content might (read: might) have an advantage over the specific niches of Twitch and Mixer.\n\nCaffeine, while live, is still in its early stages.
