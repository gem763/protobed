(SCHW) ticked up about 3.6%, to $39.11, after it reported better-than-expected third-quarter results.\n\nThe discount online broker posted a profit of $951 million, or 70 cents a share. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting earnings of 64 cents a share.\n\nCore net new assets were $56.6 billion, a third quarter record, and higher trading volume in the quarter was offset by a decline in average revenue per trade.\n\nRevenue rose to $2.71 billion from $2.58 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected $2.64 billion of revenue in the quarter.\n\nEarlier this month, Schwab said it would eliminate commissions on online stock trades, a move that rattled online brokers that have been squeezed by investors' expectation that fees for financial services should be low.\n\nShares of Schwab are down about 6% this year and roughly 18% over the past 12 months.\n\n\"The equity markets have shown noteworthy durability--the S&P 500 remained up nearly 20% for the year as of quarter-end,\" Schwab Chief Executive Walt Bettinger said. \"Concerns persist, however, regarding global trade and a generally softening economic outlook.\"\n\nWrite to Patrick Thomas at patrick.thomas@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 15, 2019 10:04 ET (14:04 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
