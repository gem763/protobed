The Astros\u2019 response is reprehensible.", "language": "en", "text": "There are two issues in the wake of Sports Illustrated\u2019s recounting of the actions of Brandon Taubman, Houston\u2019s assistant general manager: The first has to do with the Astros\u2019 handling of the matter, which is reprehensible. The second has to do with baseball\u2019s culture, in the clubhouse and the dugout and beyond, which needs to evolve.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStart with what SI reported, and look at how the Astros responded. In celebrating his team\u2019s victory over the New York Yankees in the American League Championship Series, Taubman looked at three women reporters and repeatedly yelled, \u201cThank God we got Osuna! I\u2019m so [expletive] glad we got Osuna!\u201d Stephanie Apstein of Sports Illustrated was one of the women, and she wrote SI\u2019s account. One of the women was wearing a purple anti-domestic violence bracelet.\n\nI was not there. The SI account called it \u201cfrightening.\u201d It has since been verified by at least four people present, including a male reporter. I believe the SI account.\n\nWho\u2019s Osuna? That would be Roberto, the pitcher who gave up the game-tying homer in the ninth inning, meaning the Astros needed Jose Altuve\u2019s walk-off shot to win Game 6 and clinch the pennant. Roberto Osuna is also the closer who became available to Houston in a trade with Toronto because of the domestic violence charges against him. Those charges were eventually dropped when the alleged victim went back to her home country of Mexico and refused to testify. Osuna agreed not to contact her for a year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is the bargain the Astros made when they traded for him: ignore the past because maybe he\u2019ll help the team win. It did not sit well with everyone in the organization. And the explanations at the time ignored the means to the Astros\u2019 end.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, I believe that you can have a zero-tolerance policy and also have an opportunity to give people second chances when they have made mistakes in the past in other organizations,\u201d Astros General Manager Jeff Luhnow told reporters at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of how we put those two things together.\u201d\n\nExcept those two things don\u2019t go together.\n\nBut back to Saturday night: SI asked the Astros to comment on Taubman\u2019s rant. Initially, the club declined. When the story was published, they lashed out, essentially calling it Fake News while simultaneously corroborating what Taubman said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAn Astros player was being asked questions about a difficult outing,\u201d the club\u2019s statement said. \u201cHis comments had everything to do about the game situation that just occurred and nothing else \u2014 they were also not directed toward any specific reporters.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how a correct response would read:\n\n\u201cThe Houston Astros value a civil and safe working environment for their employees and others invited into their clubhouse. We are aware of the incident and are looking into it.\u201d\n\nIf Taubman believes his words were misconstrued, he should have said so when offered the chance. He declined, or the Astros declined for him \u2014 and then went into attack mode. That seems inconceivable, until you remember this is the club that pursued Osuna in the first place.\n\nAD\n\nWhich gets us to the clubhouse and baseball\u2019s working environment. The Astros list 63 positions in their executive offices and baseball operations departments, not counting administrative assistants. Eleven of those are women. It says something about baseball that I counted that number up and thought, \u201cWow, that\u2019s more women than I thought.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWalk through the clubhouse doors, and you kind of suspend what you think of as a normal working environment. Most colleagues don\u2019t dress in front of each other. That they do so with outsiders present adds another wrinkle.\n\nOver the years, I have worked closely with, and been friends with, female reporters who cover baseball. (Full disclosure: I am friends with Stephanie Apstein of Sports Illustrated.) What\u2019s striking about the issues with which women deal in clubhouses is not how much they talk about it. It\u2019s how little they talk about it.\n\nAD\n\nThey hear raunchy jokes that would be taboo in a cubicle-filled law office. They hear comments on their own appearances. They are offered phone numbers they don\u2019t want. And, for the most part, they just take it, because the job involves building trust with players, and maybe laughing at an inappropriate joke shows that they\u2019re tough enough to take it. They keep those things in-house because doing so allows them to do their job. Don\u2019t complain. Just internalize.\n\nAD\n\nThey shouldn\u2019t have to. The vast majority of major league players and executives are accommodating and respectful and don\u2019t think twice about whether a reporter is male or female. Are they fair? Do they know the game? Are they trying to learn about it? Those are the only questions that matter.\n\nBut because it\u2019s a sport played by men and, largely, run by men, there\u2019s an imbalance that not only emboldens Taubman to shout what he shouted but discourages anyone else from objecting to him. It\u2019s infuriating he could be so offensive. It\u2019s infuriating the Astros didn\u2019t see how the women could feel threatened by it. It\u2019s infuriating it\u2019s 2019, and it\u2019s the World Series, and we even need to be having this conversation. But clearly we do.\n\nAD\n\nRead more World Series coverage:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "A baseball clubhouse is never going to be a normal workplace.
