His companion Antoan Zahariev also received a slash wound to his body.\n\nPalfreeman was charged with murder and pleaded not guilty on the basis of self defence. Prosecutors argued hat he attacked the group unprovoked.\n\nHe was found guilty in 2009 and sentenced to 20 years with a non-parole period of 10.\n\nWhile his most recent parole application was rejected, a court of appeal was satisfied that he had been rehabilitated, and ordered his release.", "description": "Jock Palfreeman, the Australian man who has spent nearly 11 years in jail for murder in Bulgaria, is finally free on parole.", "authors": ["Alasdair Duncan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/JockPalfreemanFreeParole.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
