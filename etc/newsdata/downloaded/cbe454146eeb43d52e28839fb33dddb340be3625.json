If a deal with the remaining 27 EU members cannot be secured at a European Council meeting on October 17 and 18, then the U.K. could still leave the bloc without an agreement two weeks later.\n\nFirms and business lobbying groups that have sent representatives to the Conservative Party conference in Manchester have, however, come away pessimistic that warnings of the consequences of a no-deal Brexit will be heeded, amid signs of a growing disconnect from the party traditionally regarded as the natural champion of business.\n\n\"Some have been warned that if they're too critical they will be kept outside of that in the future,\" said a representative from a multinational business.\n\n\"We come, we listen, we make our point but the government is fed up hearing about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit,\" said one representative from a multinational business. \"Two huge populist forces have taken over the two main parties.\"\n\nA government spokesperson said they did not recognize accounts of businesses being warned not to speak out publicly.\n\n\"We have been actively listening to businesses of all sizes and are encouraging each of them to prepare for Brexit on October 31,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nBearers of bad news\n\nBoth the representative of the multinational firm and a second senior lobbyist said active discussions are ongoing across different businesses about whether to time an intervention around the European Council meeting.\n\nBut lobbyists also say they fear their access to government \u2014 via business roundtables, meetings with officials and ministers, and input into government's industrial strategy \u2014 could be jeopardized if they make a prominent public statement warning about no-deal risks.\n\n\"Some have been warned that if they're too critical they will be kept outside of that in the future,\" said the multinational representative.\n\nA second business lobbyist said Downing Street officials and ministers have not been explicit that firms risk being frozen out, but frustration at the top of government with warnings about the risks of no-deal was clear. They added that the government's relentless focus on Brexit has meant businesses have struggled to get a hearing on any other issues.\n\n\"They are so focused on getting it done that all the other engagement has not been productive in the same way,\" the lobbyist said.\n\nThe representative of a multinational firm said the government's sole focus had been \"business readiness issues.\"\n\n\"Basically it's 'don't play the game in public or otherwise you will be given the cold shoulder,'\" they said. \"Privately, business lobby groups are being really, really clear about [what] an unmitigated disaster no deal would be, but the public rhetoric is restrained.\"\n\n'Unbearable uncertainty'\n\nSpeaking to POLITICO last week ahead of Conservative Party conference, Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said a no-deal outcome would create \"the most extraordinary, unbearable uncertainty for individuals and for business.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that we say that. It\u2019s not always the most popular thing for us to say but people do need to understand that it is not a great leap to freedom this cliff, it is a descent into something that is going to be very difficult to get out of,\" she said. She made no suggestion that the CBI had been urged by government to refrain from public no-deal warnings.\n\nFairbairn said it was important that the government \"listen to voices of concern about no-deal as well as the voices in support of preparation \u2026 even if those voices are not exactly what they want to be hearing at that moment in time.\"\n\nWhile saying the CBI had enjoyed \"good engagement\" with the government, and that preparations for a no-deal were \"welcome,\" Fairbairn added there was no way all businesses could be ready for the scenario.\n\n\u201cThere are thousands of small businesses out there which just don\u2019t have the resources,\" she said, adding that for many other firms exporting products that will face significant new tariffs there was nothing that could do be done to mitigate what would be \"a fundamental shift in the competitiveness of their business model.\u201d", "description": "Lobbyists remain fearful of a no-deal Brexit but worry they will lose access to government if they speak out.", "authors": ["Charlie Cooper", "Tracy Brabin"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1153537739-1200x628.jpg"}
