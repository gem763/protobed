Their enthusiasm grew when their physics teacher recognized the brothers would be strong candidates and encouraged them to apply.\n\nTWIN SISTERS FROM TEXAS SPLIT TO ATTEND SEPARATE US MILITARY ACADEMIES\n\nJacob and Joshua attended West Point\u2019s Summer Leaders Experience (SLE) between their junior and senior years, and \u201cthey came back hooked,\u201d Dave Lowe said.\n\n\u201cThey both knew they wanted to go to a military academy, and so they spent the rest of the summer applying for four academies - West Point, [the] Naval Academy, Air Force and Coast Guard - along with going to physicals, applying for congressional nominations and also applying for national ROTC scholarships,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile both the twins initially eyed West Point as their first choice, Dave Lowe says Navy's cross country coach told the brothers they had potential to run for Navy.\n\n\u201cThat was a pivotal moment for them because up until then, they both had been focused pretty much on West Point. They decided to take a chance and switch their preference, and after going through the interview process, they found out about a week later that they both had received [congressional] nominations to both the Navy and West Point,\u201d Dave Lowe said. \u201cThey were pretty excited, to say the least.\u201d\n\nNEW US ARMY SOLDIER GETS FIRST HAIRCUT IN 15 YEARS TO JOIN MILITARY\n\nThe twins received separate offers, Jacob at the Naval Academy and Joshua at West Point, and each brother accepted them.\n\nThe twins graduated high school on June 13 and the family flew to Maryland for the Naval Academy\u2019s I-Day, or Induction Day, on June 27. Having said goodbye to Jacob, the family then drove to New York for West Point\u2019s R-Day, or Reception Day, on July 1.\n\nWhile the brother's training and academics have been rigorous, Jacob Lowe says that initially, the hardest part was being away from each other.\n\n\u201cIn my time at the United States Naval Academy, I realized that being away from my brother, while tough, has allowed me to grow as an individual,\u201d Jacob told Fox News via his father. \u201cWhile it was definitely a culture shock not having him around, I realize at some point that I would have to part ways with him and go a separate path than him.\u201d\n\nLAS VEGAS MAN, 18, DROPS 113 POUNDS SO HE CAN ENLIST IN THE ARMY\n\nJacob added that he experienced homesickness during the Naval Academy's Plebe Summer, \u201cbut the phone calls reminded me of the support system I had not only at the Academy, but at home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile my brother is not around physically, I still try to talk with him every few days to check in and ask him about life at West Point. At home, he was the person who pushed me to be my best in academics or athletics, and being at the Naval Academy is no different,\u201d Jacob says. \u201cWhile not here beside me, he is here in spirit. Whenever an exercise gets hard or I want to quit, I imagine Joshua next to me, pushing me to go forward.\n\n\u201cOriginally, I wanted to go to school with my brother and never considered going to college somewhere different than him,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cHowever, God had different plans for us. And so far, it has been a great period of growth for the both of us. At home, friends thought of as \u2018the twins.\u2019 At Annapolis, I am seen [as] more of an individual - though I like to tell my friends I have an identical twin at West Point! So far, the experience has been great, and I look forward to seeing him at the Army-Navy [football] game in December.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was definitely weird,\u201d Dave Lowe said of dropping off the boys at different colleges. \u201cI don't think they had ever been separated more than one night, which only happened twice that I can think of. They had been apart from us, their parents, but they were not used to being apart from each other.\u201d\n\nDave and Jen did not hear from their boys much for a few weeks and were expecting a call from both on July 21.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cSure enough, Jacob calls my wife's phone a few minutes into the scheduled window time,\u201d the father said. \"Five minutes later, Joshua calls my wife trying to FaceTime. We quickly told Jacob to hang up and call my phone, which he did.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe then were able to let each of them talk to each other by putting them on speakerphone and putting the phones next to each other,\" he added. \"It was obviously very good for their souls to talk to each other.\"", "description": "Jacob and Joshua Lowe have been known as the \u201cLowebros\u201d for most of their lives.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/Joshua-and-Jacob-Lowe-1.jpg"}
