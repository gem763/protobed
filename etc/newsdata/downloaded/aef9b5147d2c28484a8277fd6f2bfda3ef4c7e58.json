From there, she became the first member of her family ever to board a plane, and came to New York.\n\nThe mother of one of the 112 Nigerian schoolgirls of Chibok still missing after being abducted by Boko Haram in 2014 came to the city during the UN general assembly, on a mission to remind the world that \u2013 five years on \u2013 their children still have not been brought home.\n\nGalang feels the world had forgotten about the kidnapped girls.\n\n\u201cIf this was the president\u2019s or vice-president\u2019s daughter, they would have found her by now,\u201d Galang told the Guardian. \u201cBut in three years they don\u2019t call us. We\u2019ve heard nothing. We cry and cry and the tears dry, and still we have no answer.\u201d\n\nHer daughter, Rifkatu, was 18 when she was abducted along with 275 other girls from her secondary school dormitory by members of the terrorist group. Every month, Galaga washes her abducted daughter\u2019s clothes so they will be fresh for her when she comes home. She would be 23 now. Galang has faith that her daughter is still alive, but she has lost hope that the Nigerian government is doing anything to help locate her.\n\nThe mass abduction in April 2014 shocked the world, dominated headlines and led to the viral #bringbackourgirls campaign. In the months that followed, local and international media swarmed the town of Chibok. \u201cThey came again whenever some girls were returned,\u201d says Galang. \u201cNow, just a few journalists come each year on the anniversary of the abduction.\u201d\n\nIt was the silence surrounding the once huge story that led Nigerian film-maker Joel Kachi Benson to visit Chibok last year. What he found was a town still traumatised by loss and enduring not just the uncertainty of their daughter\u2019s fates but also the grinding hardship of poverty. He decided to make a film there.\n\nOn his second day of shooting, he met Galang. He knew he had found his main character. Galang had become the parents\u2019 unofficial leader, partly because she can speak English. \u201cYana never set out to become a leader. She became a leader because of tragedy,\u201d says Benson.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The poster for Joel Kashi Benson documentary Daughters of Chibok, which won the virtual reality story award at the Venice film festival\n\n\u201cWhen I first met him I didn\u2019t want to talk to him. I saw him walk towards me with his little scruffy hair and beard, I thought maybe he was one of the terrorists!\u201d Galang recounts.\n\nThe outcome of his time there is the deeply moving short film Daughters of Chibok. Benson shot the film in virtual reality because he wanted to take viewers into Chibok, with its dusty vegetable market and tin-roofed homes. It is a goal he has achieved perfectly.\n\n\u201cMost of these women have other children they are struggling to feed and educate, but one is missing and, while you are yet to find her, the others are living in abject poverty \u2013 that is a double tragedy,\u201d says Benson.\n\nStress has inevitably taken a heavy toll on the girls\u2019 parents, 33 of whom have died after falling ill.\n\n\u201cI wanted to amplify the voices of these women,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI wanted to help them get global reach. Because it is not that they are not talking. They are talking, but nobody is listening.\u201d\n\nBenson\u2019s film won the virtual reality story award at the Venice film festival on 9 September. The ensuing publicity has brought new hope to the parents of the missing girls. In his acceptance speech in Venice, Benson says: \u201cYou cannot move on from this tragedy because it is not over yet.\u201d\n\nBenson raised the money to bring Galang to New York as part of what is now a very personal cause. The two have become very close. Benson calls her \u201cMama\u201d.\n\nJoy as 82 Chibok schoolgirls hug and kiss their families again Read more\n\n\u201cI really love him,\u201d says Galang. \u201cI call him on the phone just to hear his voice.\u201d\n\nBenson himself knows first hand the struggle of poverty. His father abandoned his mother when he was just 10, leaving her with six children and no skills. His mother died when he was 17 and Benson then spent some years homeless, sleeping in churches with his brother.\n\n\u201cMy own mother died of heartbreak and poverty in front of my eyes,\u201d says Benson. \u201cWhen I met Yana I thought: \u2018No I can\u2019t allow this to happen again.\u2019\u201d\n\nGalang says her message is a simple one. \u201cWe are begging you, the leaders of the world, to join hands with the Nigerian government to please bring our girls for us. They are our blood, we still miss them. To lose someone who you love is very difficult.\u201d", "description": "Five years after she last saw her daughter, Yana Galang fears the world has forgotten a tragedy that splintered families and made global headlines", "authors": ["Tara Sutton In New York"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22d6fac85f66c7e1000d7b2e9b7b46776bb0e295/0_355_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aac0e32ba0292796ed83241e5b70f9e3"}
