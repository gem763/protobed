(courtesy of Virginia Tech)\n\nNew this season at Virginia Tech football games: the machines we all fear will one day take over the world.\n\nHokies cheerleaders once did a push-up for each point scored by the home team. This season, they\u2019ve been replaced by a dog-like robot meant to show off the university\u2019s top-notch engineering program. It\u2019s a little creepy, a little cool and definitely unique.\n\nThe quadrupedal machine, made by Philadelphia-based Ghost Robotics, gets carried into the end zone after each score on a wooden platform, and with a PhD student manning the controls nearby, twitches its animatronic legs in what can charitably be described as a push-up. (To be fair, the Hokies this season can charitably be described as a football team.)\n\nVIRGINIA TECH HAS A PUSH-UP ROBOT \ud83e\udd16\ud83d\ude33 pic.twitter.com/EylimiKqlB \u2014 ESPN (@espn) September 28, 2019\n\nSo what exactly is that thing?\n\n\u201cWe would like to make robots that can walk or run like animals or like humans,\u201d said Kaveh Akbari Hamed, a Virginia Tech assistant professor of mechanical engineering.\n\nUh, what\u2019s that now?\n\n\u201cWe see the greatest dexterity in animals,\u201d he said. \u201cMore than half of the earth\u2019s landscape is unreachable to wheeled robots or wheeled cars. But you see in reality that four-legged locomotion can go anywhere. There is biology-inspired motivation here. We want to have robots that at least look like, from the hardware point of view, animals. We hope to get the same mobility and dexterity.\u201d\n\n[Miami has the Turnover Chain. Maryland has a throne of towels.]\n\nHamed and a team of student researchers study the mathematical algorithms that provide these four-legged robots more balance and the ability to make complicated maneuvers. Companies like Ghost Robotics send them robots to test those algorithms. The goal is for the robots to master different gaits, Hamed said, like a dog\u2019s ambling trot or a cheetah\u2019s sprint.\n\nYou know those terrifying videos of robots \u2014 sometimes made by other companies \u2014 doing gymnastics or jumping over boxes or otherwise practicing for world domination? That\u2019s what Hamed and his students work on, as well.\n\nBoston Dynamics keeps proving that Black Mirror is real pic.twitter.com/l1HmlUyjtI \u2014 CNET (@CNET) October 4, 2019\n\nBut, he said, there are good reasons for creating robots that look and move so much like humans and animals.\n\n\u201cWe are living in our houses, and these houses, these factories, these offices are made for us, bipedal walkers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf these robots are supposed to help us, it makes sense that these robots have legs like us to step over stairs, to step over gaps, to live in the environments we are living in.\u201d\n\nThese robots could be used in disaster-response scenarios, he said, or in industrial accidents. They could also act as assistants, like service animals. The first step toward realizing those goals is to enable the machines to master moving through rough terrain, then to give them autonomous capability so they can navigate that terrain on their own.\n\nIn other words, Kaveh said, people need to recognize these robots as positive things, creations that can and will help them one day. That\u2019s why he\u2019s so pleased when he sees the touchdown robot on the field celebrating Virginia Tech scores.\n\n\u201cMy goal is for us to one day have these robots in society assisting people,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I see that people like it \u2014 it\u2019s a friendly creature for society, and it is going to assist people, not replace anyone \u2014 it is a very nice moment. If society likes these kind of things, let\u2019s work harder and make it better and better.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAs LSU revels in a newly brilliant offense, it can thank the coaching cradle of William & Mary\n\nNoah Lyles, with two world track championship gold medals, returns home\n\nCuban soccer player reportedly goes missing before Nations League match in D.C.\n\nThe maddening details of Redskins interim coach Bill Callahan\u2019s \u2018beautiful mind\u2019", "description": "\u201cWe would like to make robots that can walk or run like animals or like humans,\u201d said the engineer in charge of the machine.", "authors": ["Jacob Bogage", "National Sports Writer", "October At Am", "Jacob Bogage Writes About Sports For The Post", "Where He Has Worked Since He Previously Covered The Automotive", "Manufacturing Industries For The Business Section."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SOloM-3H-g-IPm7mQC39Y3v_p_0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NFMXE37PMZD5XEBMEGJG3QFYPI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
