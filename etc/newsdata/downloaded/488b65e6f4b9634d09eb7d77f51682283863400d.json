USA TODAY\n\nA white man who claimed self-defense under Florida\u2019s \u201cstand your ground\u2019\u2019 law after killing an unarmed black man over a parking dispute was sentenced Thursday to 20 years in prison.\n\nA jury had found Michael Drejka guilty of manslaughter in August for the shooting death of 28-year-old Markeis McGlockton outside a convenience store in Clearwater, Florida. Circuit Judge Joseph Bulone referred to the convicted killer as a \u201cwanna-be\u2019\u2019 law enforcement officer and a self-appointed \u201chandicapped parking-space monitor.\u2019\u2019\n\nDrejka, 49, had engaged in an argument with McGlockton\u2019s girlfriend, Britany Jacobs, in July 2018 over parking in a spot for handicapped people without the proper permit. She had stayed in the car with the couple\u2019s younger children while McGlockton went in the store with their 5-year-old son.\n\nWhen another customer alerted McGlockton to the dispute, he came out and pushed Drejka to the ground. Surveillance video shows McGlockton backing up with his arms to his side when Drejka pulls out a gun from a sitting position.\n\nMcGlockton was turning toward the front of the store and away from the gunman when he was shot once in the torso, then ran into the store and collapsed in front of his son, Markeis Jr. He was pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nMichael Drejka sits in court during a bond hearing at the Pinellas County Justice Center in Clearwater, Florida.
