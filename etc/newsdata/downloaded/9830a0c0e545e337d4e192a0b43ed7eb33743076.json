Funny how Harris will shiv Biden as some sort of racist over his history with busing but won\u2019t touch Ukraine.\n\nIn that light, we bring you both a video and a Twitter thread from Glenn Beck which encourages citizens to look well beyond President Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president to the Obama administration and its #UnitedForUkraine hashtag diplomacy.\n\nFirst, here\u2019s the video courtesy of Mark Levin:\n\nThis is a terrific explanation of the Ukraine scandal by Glenn. Well worth watching. https://t.co/1T78Lzxr8v \u2014 Mark R. Levin (@marklevinshow) October 7, 2019\n\nBut if you\u2019re in an office cubicle and video just won\u2019t fly, here it is condensed into handy tweet format.\n\n(THREAD) 1/ Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, after two years of investigation and millions of dollars, wouldn\u2019t impeach @realdonaldtrump. But a single whistleblower, based off of hearsay, was enough to change their minds? Why? Consider these facts: \u2014 Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) October 7, 2019\n\nNot to mention, she announced the impeachment inquiry a day before the call transcript was released to the public.\n\n2/ Democrats want you to only focus on the July 25th call. If you\u2019re doing that, then you\u2019re not looking at what Democrats have been doing in Ukraine for the past 5+ years: corruption, greed, strong-arming a foreign government and the manipulation of the U.S. election. \u2014 Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) October 7, 2019\n\n3/ In February 2014, the Ukrainian Regime fell. Democrats were all over the place in Ukraine, although all the media was concerned about was Paul Manafort. But Democrats sent Obama\u2019s White House counsel, Chief Strategists for Hillary and Bernie, Tony Podesta and Obama\u2019s pollsters \u2014 Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) October 7, 2019\n\n4/ In March 2014, Obama made Biden the point man for Ukraine. And in April 2014, Devon Archer visited Biden at the White House. 5 days later Biden arrived in Kiev for his first meeting with the Ukraine Gov. \u2014 Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) October 7, 2019\n\n5/ Biden\u2019s meeting in Ukraine was regarding a program to assist Ukraine\u2019s natural gas industry, and also discussed the first billion dollars in U.S. assistance. The day after this, Archer was named to the board of Burisma. Three weeks later\u2026 Hunter Biden joined the Board. \u2014 Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) October 7, 2019\n\n6/ Obama rode in on his white horse to save the day, guaranteeing a 1 billion sovereign loan, 320 million in general assistance, and a fleet of advisors and experts. The Obama admin became the Ukrainian piggy bank. https://t.co/dQYjw6uQYc \u2014 Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) October 7, 2019\n\n7/ In April 2015, the Obama Admin and IMF mandated Ukraine set up the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and they signed an information sharing agreement with the FBI. The Obama admin would know all the dirty laundry that Ukraine might dig up. https://t.co/VbrnhFa3HB \u2014 Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) October 7, 2019\n\n8/ A man named Artem Sytnyk was tapped to be the first Director. A position he still holds. https://t.co/8fTKHNpSn8 \u2014 Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) October 7, 2019\n\n9/ In March 2016, Biden forced the removal of Ukraine\u2019s General Prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma. Biden claimed it had nothing to do with his son, but Shokin\u2019s sworn testimony in a European Court completely contradicts this. \u2014 Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) October 7, 2019\n\nBeck had better be careful or he\u2019s going to have to deal with Booker on this. No Fox News conspiracy theories allowed!\n\nThis whole exercise is to create chaos for the next 18 months, they know the Senate will never follow through\u2026 \u2014 Daniel Owens (@Owensdm4198) October 7, 2019\n\nDeath by a thousand cuts is their game. \u2014 David Empson (@Doc_Rock1) October 7, 2019\n\nRelated:", "description": "Glenn Beck says if all you're looking at is one phone call, you're missing the big picture.", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jenn-psaki-united-for-ukraine.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
