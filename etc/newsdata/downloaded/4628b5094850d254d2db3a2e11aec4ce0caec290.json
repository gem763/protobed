Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), a longtime impeachment backer.\n\nThe skepticism underscores a problem Democrats face as they weigh whether to draft articles of impeachment this fall: Voters overwhelmingly oppose a move to oust the president \u2014 and some polls even show sentiment moving in the opposite direction.\n\nThe public, some Democrats fear, is becoming desensitized to Trump-related scandals, making the committee\u2019s job convincing voters even more difficult. Former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s report detailed 10 episodes of possible obstruction of the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But if the report wasn\u2019t enough to move the polling on impeachment, Democrats wonder if hearings with people such as Lewandowski will.\n\n\u201cThere is a numbness that is occurring month by month,\u201d said Rep. Daniel Kildee (D-Mich.). \u201cHe gets more and more outrageous, far more bold. But there\u2019s this immunity that he seems to be developing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny other president, had they done one of those things [Trump has] \u2014 the public would be screaming,\u201d said Rep. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.). \u201cThe public has become numb, and he gets away with it.\u201d\n\nTrump and White House officials, meanwhile, are reveling in Democrats\u2019 difficulties. In fact, the president \u2014 who watched Lewandowski\u2019s testimony from Air Force One on Tuesday \u2014 was laughing and joking about the hearing, arguing that Democrats have no idea what they\u2019re doing and that no one cared about the Mueller report anymore, according to one person who spoke with him.\n\nThe individual spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely describe what transpired.\n\nTwo White House officials suggested that the administration could defy congressional requests because House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has made it clear she is reluctant about impeachment. They also have calculated that there won\u2019t be a public price to pay for stonewalling Congress, in part because the clock is running out.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m looking at the legislative calendar, you\u2019re seeing there is not much left there. How much can they really do between now and when everyone is trying to run for their seats?\u201d asked a senior White House official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions.\n\nThe gap between Democrats\u2019 desire to impeach Trump and the public\u2019s position means the party could find itself in a political bind this fall: Do they follow their base and vote to oust him, or do nothing and risk history\u2019s judgment for standing pat as well as liberal wrath heading into the 2020 elections.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Democrats argue that it doesn\u2019t have to be either-or. Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.) often notes that only 19 percent of Americans supported removing President Richard M. Nixon before lawmakers began their impeachment inquiry in 1973; but by the summer of 1974, a majority backed his ousting, suggesting the panel can build a case against Trump.\n\n\u201cI see the whole country and the whole Congress as in an educational phase right now,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a Judiciary Committee member. \u201cI know everybody wants to jump to the end of the process. But we really are in the active investigative mode.\u201d\n\nOn Capitol Hill, however, there\u2019s a sense that time left to move sentiment is running out. Lawmakers say they need to decide on impeachment by the end of the year, leaving the Judiciary Committee only a couple of months to make its public case. That pressure has caused occasional tension in the pro-impeachment caucus, with some questioning the Judiciary strategy and wondering why they\u2019re not doing more hearings.\n\nDisagreements were also evident Wednesday in the wake of the Lewandowski hearing, with some Democrats dismissing the exercise as unhelpful.\n\nHuffman said the hearing amounted to \u201ca food fight,\u201d although he blamed the combative former Trump official, not his colleagues, for the result. He, along with other Democrats, wondered whether the panel would be better served to have its staff do more of the questioning: After hours of partisan bickering, Judiciary staff lawyer Barry Berke had some success pinning Lewandowski down at the end of the hearing Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI mean, I wouldn\u2019t presume to tell Chairman Nadler how to do it, but if you want to get the goods up front, that seems like a good way to do it,\u201d Huffman said. \u201cClearly, it was more productive.\u201d\n\nJudiciary panel member J. Luis Correa (D-Calif.), however, dismissed the idea that lawmakers would yield to unelected lawyers. \u201cMembers are pretty jealous and protective of their five minutes,\u201d he said, referring to the allotted time Democrats have for questioning witnesses.\n\nLewandowski mocks Democrats, talks over lawmakers, promotes possible Senate bid\n\nRep. Emanuel Cleaver II (D-Mo.) said the hearing essentially made the Democrats look weak, exposing Congress\u2019s inability to overcome presidential stonewalling. Lewandowski talked over lawmakers, dodged questions and even used the hearing to promote a potential U.S. Senate bid in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cThe founders never believed that this kind of thing would happen, so there\u2019s no way to deal with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the American people looked at that and thought, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 We understand it, but they look at this like: What? Screaming at members of Congress?\u201d\n\nDemocrats on the Judiciary Committee defended their strategy Wednesday, arguing that Lewandowski gave them fodder to say Trump has trampled the Constitution and is not respecting the powers of Congress.\n\n\u201cEven though it was a rocky hearing yesterday, in retrospect, as people think about it, they will come to the conclusions that Corey Lewandowski was lying, and he was covering up for the president, and he was protecting the president \u2014 and they want to know why,\u201d said Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.). \u201cSo it will increase the curiosity and the suspiciousness of the American people.\u201d\n\nRep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.) also said it was unrealistic for one hearing to move public sentiment on the issue. \u201cThis is a process in which we\u2019re building a case,\u201d he said. \u201cThis notion that, like, \u2018Oh, is this going to turn the tide today?\u2019 No.\u201d\n\nCongressional Republicans have goaded the party over the apparent insistence on moving forward with impeachment. On Wednesday, Rep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-Pa.) insisted that the Democratic rank and file are \u201crabid\u201d over the idea of impeachment and dubbed them the \u201cParty of Impeachment.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have blamed the White House for making their job difficult. The Trump administration has blocked progress on more than 20 Hill investigations, keeping ex-aides from testifying and documents from being handed over. That\u2019s why Judiciary Democrats are also looking to the courts to help them make their case to the public. A circuit court is expected to rule in late October on whether former White House counsel Donald McGahn must testify.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to craft a story, get the facts out there for the American people so they can see what is happening with their government,\u201d said House Democratic Caucus vice chair Katherine M. Clark (D-Mass.). \u201cAnd I think as those facts come out, we\u2019re going to see where public sentiment is because we want to do this \u2014 as the speaker said many times \u2014 in a unified way, with public sentiment behind us.\u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "The first major impeachment hearing with former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski divided Democrats about the Judiciary Committee\u2019s strategy.", "authors": ["Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PE4EMKG2I4I6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
