The key criteria for the Form D exemption is that only \u201caccredited investors,\u201d that is, individuals that have a net worth of over $1 million, or that have consistently made over $200,000 per year in income, or companies that have over $5 million in assets, can invest. Companies don\u2019t have to file the Form D before the offering takes place, but instead within 15 days after the first sale of securities in the offering.\n\nA Coindesk article at the time said that Telegram was using the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens, or SAFT legal structure to raise money from accredited investors before a functioning network is built, although the Form D characterizes the type of securities being sold as \u201cPurchase Agreements for Cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nTelegram\u2019s CEO, Pavel Valerievich Durov, signed the filing, which said the company would use the funds for the development of \u201cthe TON Blockchain, the development and maintenance of Telegram Messenger and the other purposes described in the offering materials.\u201d\n\nAnother media report at the time, however, said that \u201cinvestors who got in on an earlier, private investment round, are already flipping their GRAM cryptotokens for twice the price they paid\u201d and that the GRAM coins held by the SAFT accredited investors, could then be resold to consumers.\n\nThe SEC, in its request for a halt, said that Telegram sold approximately 2.9 billion digital tokens called \u201cGrams\u201d at discounted prices to 171 initial purchasers worldwide, including 39 U.S.-based purchasers who bought more than 1 billion Grams, raising $424.5 million from the U.S. investors.\n\nTelegram had promised to deliver the Grams to the initial purchasers no later than October 31, 2019, a launch date for its blockchain that is now suddenly imminent.\n\nOnce the Grams were delivered, the purchasers and Telegram would be able to sell billions of Grams into U.S. markets, the SEC said. The SEC says Telegram failed to register their offers and sales of Grams, which it says are securities, in violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933.\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly stated that issuers cannot avoid the federal securities laws just by labeling their product a cryptocurrency or a digital token,\u201d Steven Peikin, Co-Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement said in a press release. \u201cTelegram seeks to obtain the benefits of a public offering without complying with the long-established disclosure responsibilities designed to protect the investing public.\u201d\n\nThe SEC wants Telegram to return all funds raised, and pay a fine that includes prejudgment interest.\n\nIn early 2018, the SEC issued several subpoenas to crypto-related companies under the guise of information gathering that would assist the SEC with better understanding the legal and regulatory as well as market dynamics of ICO investments.\n\nLisa Bragan\u00e7a, a former SEC Enforcement branch chief in Chicago who now runs her own law firm, told MarketWatch, \u201cTelegram may have been one of the 80 or more crypto-token firms that received an SEC subpoena in early 2018. If an investigation began back then, it is likely that the SEC tried to settle with Telegram before the end of the federal fiscal year on September 30.\n\nHowever, Telegram was also set to \u201cto flood the U.S. capital markets,\u201d as the SEC\u2019s halt order alleges, by October 31, 2019 with billions of its tokens called Grams. \u201cTime was running out for the SEC to prevent those tokens, which it says are unregistered securities, from potentially getting into the hands of many retail investors,\u201d Bragan\u00e7a told MarketWatch.\n\nSome companies that received those subpoenas have already settled with the SEC and others chose to fight the charges.\n\nThe SEC sued Kik Interactive in June 2019 for raising $100 million without registering the offering of securities with the regulator. Kik also used a Form D offering to reach investors initially in late 2017, starting out by raising money from wealthy investors but then targeting a broader base.\n\nSee also: SEC action threatens billions raised in initial coin offerings that ostensibly targeted only wealthy investors\n\nThe SEC alleges Kik did not do enough to determine whether all investors qualified as \u201caccredited investors,\u201d despite a know-your-customer process and other anti-money-laundering policies. It also allegedly did not determine whether investors intended to profit from their purchase or to immediately resell and distribute the digital coin.\n\nKik has now capitulated, announcing on Sept. 24 it would shut down its core messaging service. In a company blog post, its CEO said the ongoing dispute with SEC forced Kik to shut down the app and shrink its crypto operations.\n\n\u201cAfter 18 months of working with the SEC the only choice they gave us was to either label Kin a security or fight them in court,\u201d Livingston wrote. \u201cSo with the SEC working to characterize almost all cryptocurrencies as securities we made the decision to step forward and fight.\u201d", "description": "Telegram says it\u2019s surprised that the SEC halted its plans to launch wide distribution of its Gram tokens but there are now plenty of examples of other...", "authors": ["Francine Mckenna"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ851_telegr_ZG_20190906130331.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
