That\u2019s billions of dollars more than PG&E has offered to those who lost loved ones and homes in some of the most destructive fires in California history.\n\nThe coalition threatens to derail PG&E\u2019s own reorganization plans and adds a new wrinkle to an already complex case involving the biggest utility bankruptcy in U.S. history. The creditors and wildfire victims are seeking to end the San Francisco-based company\u2019s exclusive right to come up with a proposal so they can put forth theirs. Their joint one would virtually wipe out current shareholders while PG&E\u2019s plan would allow them to keep stock and pay wildfire victims less than they\u2019re demanding.\n\nThe group\u2019s proposal \u201crepresents a path forward that recognizes the victims\u2019 losses and puts their interests ahead of shareholders,\u201d Robert Julian, an attorney for the official committee representing fire victims, said in a statement.\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy protection in January in the face of an estimated $30 billion or more in liabilities from wildfires. Under PG&E\u2019s reorganization plan, claims from individual wildfire victims would be capped at $8.4 billion, while insurers or insurance claim holders would get $11 billion under a settlement announced last week.\n\n\u201cThe bondholders\u2019 plan is an attempt to pay themselves more than they are entitled to under the law,\u201d Lynsey Paulo, a PG&E spokeswoman, said by email. \u201cOur plan of reorganization sets forth a framework to meet PG&E\u2019s legal obligations in full while prioritizing victims and customers.\u201d\n\nThe new bondholder proposal offers $28.4 billion in new money in exchange for 58.8% of the equity in the reorganized PG&E. Under an earlier proposal, creditors had offered financing in exchange for an 85% to 95% stake in the new company.\n\nA $24 billion wildfire trust fund would be set up and financed through $12 billion in cash and $12 billion in stock, according to the filing. The trust would have a 39.5% stake in PG&E. Overall, the creditor group and the trust would end up with a combined 98.3% of the equity in PG&E.\n\nBankruptcy judge Dennis Montali had rejected an earlier request from creditors to be allowed to file their own bankruptcy plan.\n\nThe case is PG&E Corp., 19-bk-30088, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Northern District of California (San Francisco)\n\n--With assistance from Joel Rosenblatt and Steven Church.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Mark Chediak in San Francisco at mchediak@bloomberg.net;Scott Deveau in New York at sdeveau2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Doan at ldoan6@bloomberg.net, Boris Korby\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- PG&E Corp. bondholders battling with shareholders for control of the bankrupt California utility giant have teamed up with wildfire victims to present a new reorganization plan.The creditors -- including Elliott Management Corp. and Pacific Investment Management Co. -- and the official", "authors": ["Mark Chediak", "Scott Deveau"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mCiMLLmdQa6EKd.8rNcMcA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/1501cd867d7a5fb4fac2506cd0f8bec8", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
