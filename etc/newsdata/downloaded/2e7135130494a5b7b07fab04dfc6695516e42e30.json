It starts at a modest $649, which is cheaper than the $999 Pixelbook, but that smaller price comes with some tradeoffs. Though the Go has a touchscreen, you can\u2019t flip the that screen all the way around into tablet mode, like you can with the Pixelbook. Another tradeoff: the Go doesn\u2019t support the $99 Pixelbook Pen, Google tells Android Police.\n\nThe omission is a bit of a disappointment, as it would be nice to see the Go support Google\u2019s own stylus \u2014 right now, the Pen only works with the Pixelbook and Google\u2019s Pixel Slate tablet. There are definitely traditional laptops with stylus support, like Microsoft\u2019s recently-announced Surface Laptop 3, which supports the Surface Pen. Even some cheaper Chromebooks, like the $499 Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, have stylus support.\n\nA traditional laptop might be clunky for a stylus\n\nBut, speaking for myself, I feel like the screen angles of a traditional clamshell laptop might make using a stylus kind of clunky. Perhaps that\u2019s why Google opted not to have the Go support the Pen.\n\nIt seems unlikely that you\u2019ll accidentally buy both the Go and the incompatible Pen, at least when getting the Go through Google\u2019s online store. I went through the flow of \u201cbuying\u201d the Go to see if the Pen would be recommended to me as an add-on, and it wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s also not like Pixelbook Go buyers are likely to already have a Pen lying around, because if they already own a Pixelbook, the Go isn\u2019t powerful enough to be a likely upgrade route.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a Google-made device to easily sketch on, the Go probably isn\u2019t it \u2014 you\u2019ll have to pick between the old Pixelbook or Pixel Slate instead.", "description": "Google has announced the Pixelbook Go, its first new laptop in two years, but it doesn\u2019t support the $99 Pixelbook Pen, Google tells Android Police.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V1_bXuP5OAq6uO1KS_iBxLVOEcY=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9393931/jbareham_170921_2006_0384.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
