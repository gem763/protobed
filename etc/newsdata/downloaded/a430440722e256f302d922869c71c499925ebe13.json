(Jared Soares for The Washington Post)\n\nAfter allegations surfaced that a student was sexually abused at Capitol Hill Montessori School @ Logan, D.C. Public Schools cut ties with an after-school care provider that operates in seven states. Officials told families that student safety was paramount.\n\nBut parents at the Northeast Washington campus say the school system is not doing enough to protect students from sexual harassment, assault and abuse. They blame vague communication from school officials, \u201chazy\u201d protocols and a lack of preventive education for children and teens.\n\nParents are railing against the District\u2019s traditional public and charter school systems and demanding increased training for employees and more aggressive standards for background checks.\n\nSandra Moscoso-Mills, a Capitol Hill Montessori parent, said the alleged incident in May made her question what was going on at her daughter\u2019s school.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge breach of trust,\u201d Moscoso-Mills said. \u201cEverything that you felt comfortable with, you have to rethink.\u201d\n\nParents started examining the school\u2019s sexual misconduct policies after a Springboard Education employee was arrested and charged with allegedly having sexual contact with a 13-year-old student between January and May, according to a statement from D.C. police. Springboard is a private company based in Massachusetts that operates before- and after-school programs.\n\nParents didn\u2019t find out until a month after the allegations were reported to police. School officials announced in June that the Springboard employee, identified as Jestin Hickman of Southeast Washington, had been arrested.\n\nAn online court database did not display case information for Hickman, but Kadia Koroma, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia, said the man\u2019s preliminary hearing has been scheduled for Sept. 20.\n\nHickman\u2019s attorney declined to comment. Attempts to reach Hickman were unsuccessful.\n\nFollowing the allegations, D.C. Public Schools launched an internal review and discovered Springboard did not conduct a proper background check of its employee. Further analysis revealed more than 30 percent of school district employees have lapsed background checks.\n\nOfficials are working to whittle that number down to zero. All of the school system\u2019s before- and after-school care partners \u2014 people who work in the city\u2019s schools but are employed by outside entities \u2014 have now gone through the background-check process, said Shayne Wells, a spokesman for D.C. Public Schools.\n\nBut background checks for some school employees remain out of date, Wells said.\n\nThe district\u2019s goal is to clear all school employees by the end of September and complete updated background checks for central office staff a month later, D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Lewis D. Ferebee said in a statement.\n\nMark Freidberg, chief executive of Springboard, wrote in an August email that the company was updating background checks and implementing new training for current employees. Freidberg said the 13-year-old student was neither a Springboard student nor in the program\u2019s care.\n\nAnother Capitol Hill Montessori parent, Danica Petroshius, said the alleged incident catapulted her into a movement to demand greater transparency from education agencies. Petroshius wrote a letter in June outlining parents\u2019 questions and demands. More than 300 parents and community members signed on.\n\nPaul Kihn, the city\u2019s deputy mayor for education, responded Friday and told parents that city leaders are taking \u201caggressive strides\u201d to detect and prevent sexual misconduct.\n\nThose plans include delivering lessons on personal boundaries and consent in kindergarten through eighth-grade classrooms, expanding mental-health resources, educating students and staff about inappropriate relationships and showing students how to report misconduct.\n\n\u201cThe District government takes the safety and wellbeing of all students very seriously,\u201d Kihn said in the letter. \u201cAdditionally, DCPS has undertaken an extensive effort this summer to revamp its process for approving providers in its schools and tracking compliance with DCPS requirements that safeguard the safety and well-being of children.\u201d\n\nPetroshius said much of the information Kihn provided did not clarify her questions. She also pointed to \u201cmisinformation\u201d about the way school leaders communicated with parents. Kihn said the school system informed parents about the alleged misconduct at Capitol Hill Montessori on June 8. Petroshius said the message did not say the incident under investigation was sexual in nature.\n\n\u201cBut it does provide a lot of good resources that provide further confirmation that we, as a city, have a long way to go before we can be sure that the city is doing all it can to keep our kids safe,\u201d Petroshius wrote to Kihn.\n\nD.C. police in recent years have responded to allegations of sexual misconduct at several schools.\n\nJoseph Smith, a security guard at Anacostia High School, was charged with sexually abusing a student in October. Smith was sentenced in May to a year in prison, but a judge suspended the term and imposed three years of probation, court records show.\n\nA teacher at Latin American Montessori Bilingual Public Charter School was sentenced to eight years in prison for sexually assaulting six students between 2015 and 2017.\n\nThe issue has led D.C. Public Schools to recruit about two dozen people to serve on a Student Safety Task Force. The body will help school system officials implement safety procedures and health curriculums.\n\nMeanwhile, city leaders are working to finalize policies on reporting and investigating sexual misconduct.\n\nParents said they hope the task force\u2019s work will have wide-reaching benefits, although some worry it will take years to see results.\n\nMembers of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission that represents some Capitol Hill Montessori families voted Tuesday to ask D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) for more information about six alleged incidents of sexual misconduct in city schools.\n\n\u201cIf we know what the test scores are and we know how teachers are evaluated, why shouldn\u2019t we know if incidents of sexual harassment or abuse are also taking place?\u201d said Denise Krepp, a commissioner.\n\nAlex Nock\u2019s children do not go to Capitol Hill Montessori, but he said the alleged episode involving the Springboard employee encouraged him to investigate the sexual misconduct policies at his children\u2019s schools.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to send your kid to school for eight or nine hours a day, you want to make sure the school system has steps to minimize as much as possible any kind of assault or sexual harassment,\u201d Nock said.\n\nThe coalition of parents is prepared to fight through the school year. They still have to gather information about incidents of abuse, draft a proposal for city leaders and figure out how they will hold officials accountable, Petroshius said. For many, the demands of this advocacy work are stacked on top of full-time jobs and family obligations.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be my responsibility to do this. Some days I wake up and think, \u2018Why am I doing all this work?\u2019 Not just me, but tons of other parents,\u201d Petroshius said. \u201cBut could I ever wake up and not make this my responsibility? Absolutely not.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Parents at Capitol Hill Montessori School @ Logan demand transparency.", "authors": ["Lauren Lumpkin", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QanQG3cpeQ2i_61e66V1X3RDYZs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IKW3AYEGBMI6JJYC7IY76SXJRY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
