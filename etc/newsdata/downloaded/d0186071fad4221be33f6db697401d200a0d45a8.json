U.S. intelligence tested those samples and got a positive DNA match for Baghdadi, kicking the hunt into high gear.\n\nPresident Donald Trump thanked Syrian Kurds on Sunday for their role in the U.S. operation.\n\nIn an address to the nation live from the White House, Trump said the Kurds did not play a military role in the \"dangerous and daring\" raid, but provided \"some information that turned out to be helpful.\"\n\nThe public recognition represented a stark turn from Trump's decision to withdraw from northern Syria, a move that some critics see as a betrayal of the longtime U.S. allies that cleared the way for Turkey's incursion in the region.\n\nThe chief of the Islamic State group Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi purportedly appears for the first time in five years in a propaganda video in an undisclosed location on April 30, 2019. -\n\nAbdi praised the raid early Sunday, adding that there was \"joint intel cooperation on the ground and accurate monitoring\" for five months.\n\n\"Thanks to everybody who participate in this great mission,\" he said on Twitter, tagging Trump in the post.\n\nTrump said Baghdadi killed himself and three of his children, detonating a suicide vest as U.S. forces closed in on a compound in northwestern Syria.\n\nHe also acknowledged other nations he claimed played a part in the operation, including Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces are led by the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), which has long angered the Turkish government. Turkey views the YPG an extension of the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party, which is considered a terrorist group by the U.S.", "description": "The source proved to U.S. intelligence that he had direct access to Baghdadi this summer by turning over the ISIS leader's used underwear and a sample of his blood.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4265448/1000x563_nbc-191028-al-baghdadi-mc-822_56a8995b0df24ed81c91a92fb9516e38.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
