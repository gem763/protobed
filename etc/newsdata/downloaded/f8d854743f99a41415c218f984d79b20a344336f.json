If indeed the young man was deceased for as long as he was... then I would say that is a failing on our part and we have to adjust our processes and systems.\"\n\nLocal media reported the dead man's stepfather had raised concerns with police after being unable to contact the student via friends.\n\n\"It's not right, it's just not right on any level,\" one outlet quoted a family member as saying.\n\nCanterbury University vice-chancellor Cheryl de la Rey said it was an \"extremely distressing time\" for students and staff coming to grips with what had happened, adding an independent investigation into the death will be launched.\n\n\"Despite the comprehensive pastoral care programmes in place, for us it is inconceivable to imagine how these circumstances could have occurred,\" she said in a statement.\n\nDe la Rey promised an independent investigation into the circumstances of the death. When questioned on national radio she said she had no explanation for the student's family.\n\n\"I am deeply sorry, I and the university will do all we can to answer these questions,\" De la Rey said.\n\nHipkins added the government would wait for the outcome of investigations launched by the police and coroner, before looking at whether regulations governing student accommodation needed to change.\n\nThe university, one of New Zealand's oldest, has more than 17 000 students.\n\nUndergraduates pay around NZ$6 500 a year in fees.", "description": "A teenager lay dead in his campus dorm room for up to two months, a New Zealand university has said, with the young man's body only discovered after fellow residents complained of the smell.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9387/455de88495da49f895597e8c33f6d56a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
