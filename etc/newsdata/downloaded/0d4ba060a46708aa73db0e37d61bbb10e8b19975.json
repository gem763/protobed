REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo\n\nThe result will not affect Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u2019s grip on national power as his Cabinet is buoyed by a strong economy, fierce anti-immigration rhetoric and hefty wage rises. His ruling Fidesz party remains wildly popular in rural areas.\n\nNo general election is due until 2022 and Orban, who rose to power in 2010, holds a huge majority in parliament.\n\nWith 81.6% of votes counted, Karacsony had 50.6% support compared with 44.3% for Tarlos, according to data on the National Election Office website.\n\nThe better-than-expected showing for the opposition, including a late surge by the 44-year-old Karacsony, vindicated its strategy to field joint candidates, seen as the best way to challenge Fidesz, which had scored seven consecutive landslide election wins on the national, municipal and European levels since 2010.\n\n\u201cWe gave everyone a lesson on democracy. ... An opposition unity that voters have long expected has been formed, and the result tells us this is the path to take onwards,\u201d Karacsony told cheering supporters.\n\n\u201cChanging Budapest and the major cities is the first step toward changing Hungary,\u201d he said as 71-year-old Tarlos, the Budapest mayor since 2010, conceded defeat.\n\nOpposition parties were also on track to win a majority in the Budapest General Assembly and made gains outside the capital, with preliminary results projecting opposition mayors winning in 10 of Hungary\u2019s 23 big cities.\n\n\u201cToday, the citizens of Budapest have decided that the time has come for something different,\u201d Orban told a news conference. \u201cWe accept this decision. In the interests of the country and the citizens of Budapest, we are ready to cooperate.\u201d\n\nOrban said Fidesz was expected to win the mayoral races in over half of the towns with a population exceeding 5,000 people, adding that the number of votes cast nationwide showed his right-wing alliance remained the strongest in Hungary.\n\nOrban said, however, that Fidesz would need to pore over the election results and make adjustments to its policies. But he did not go into detail.\n\nNaz Masraff, an analyst at think tank Teneo Intelligence said the opposition\u2019s showing could solidify cooperation between opposition parties ahead of the 2022 general election.\n\n\u201cBut forming a wide opposition project will still prove to be very difficult ahead of parliamentary elections, given the need to align diverging priorities ranging from the center-right Jobbik to Liberal Momentum,\u201d he said in a note before Sunday\u2019s vote.", "description": "Hungary's opposition scored its biggest election victory in a decade on Sunday when liberal challenger Gergely Karacsony ousted ruling-party incumbent Istvan Tarlos as mayor of Budapest and opposition parties made gains in other major cities as well.", "authors": ["Gergely Szakacs", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440491721&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0OT", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
