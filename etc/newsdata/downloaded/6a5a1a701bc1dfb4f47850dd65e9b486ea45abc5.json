Fox Foundation stage $10M competition for 'game-changing' Parkinson's research", "language": "en", "text": "The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research is holding a $10 million competition to spur development of a critical research tool for the disease.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nFunded in part through a $7.5 million gift from the founder of the Chicago-based investment firm Citadel, Ken Griffin, the program offers a cash incentive for researchers to devise a tracer compound that can bind to a protein in the brain known as alpha-synuclein and illuminate its volume and location on a brain scan.\n\nAccording to the foundation, the majority of the 6 million people living with Parkinson's worldwide have clumps of alpha-synuclein in their brain, where's it's believed to harm cells and result in symptoms of the disease.\n\n\u201cProviding researchers and clinicians with the ability to detect and monitor the disease would be revolutionary for the field and, most importantly, for patients,\u201d says foundation CEO Todd Sherer. The protein clumps are now visible only through post-mortem tissue analysis, and the ability to see them would open new avenues in research on the disease.\n\nFox, who became a star with the 1980s TV series \"Family Ties,\" then starred in movies from \"The Secret of My Success\" to \"Doc Hollywood\" -- was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 1991, at age 29, and publicly disclosed it some seven years later.\n\nThe organization he founded has since developed into the world's largest nonprofit funder of Parkinson's research, with a comittment to both accelerating a cure for the disease as well as improving therapies for those living with the condition today.\n\nThe group \"has led the charge in advancing ground-breaking research in this field over the past 20 years,\u201d Griffin said in a statement. \u201cI hope this partnership with the foundation will bring us closer to a cure.\u201d\n\nThe organization plans to put a total of $8.5 million toward as many as three winning research teams working on the tool, with an extra $1.5 million to the group that makes the most progress in two years or less.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nParkinson\u2019s is a progressive nervous system disorder that occurs when brain cells that make dopamine, a chemical that coordinates movement, stop working or die.\n\nIt is referred to as a movement disorder because it can cause tremor, slowness, stiffness and walking and balance problems. Its symptoms only worsen over time.\n\nAccording to the foundation, Parkinson\u2019s affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide.", "description": "The hedge fund manager and the actor, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 1991, are teaming up to find a cure.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/ken-griffin-michael-j-fox-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
