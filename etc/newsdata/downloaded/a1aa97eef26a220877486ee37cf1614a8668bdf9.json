The results indicate that 73 percent completely reject the idea of Libra as a digital currency. 42 percent because they do not trust Facebook as a company and 31 percent because they only have trust in state-controlled currencies.\n\nThe rejection of Libra among the over 35 age group is significantly higher than among younger consumers. In the age group 55 plus, 85 percent said that it is impossible to do anything with the digital Facebook currency. Libra finds its biggest support in the age group between 22 and 34 years. In this age group, almost 42 percent of the consumers would be open to using the stablecoin.\n\nGerman finance minister rejects Libra coin\n\nGermany is obviously not the biggest fan of Facebook\u2019s Libra coin. Cointelegraph reported in September that German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz stated that policymakers cannot accept parallel currencies such as Facebook's proposed Libra stablecoin.\n\nThat statement was quickly followed by news that the German government had approved a blockchain strategy to prevent stablecoins from becoming alternative currencies and threatening state sovereignty.\n\nUnited States Senator supports Libra\n\nUnited States Senator Mike Rounds wrote to Nathan McCauley, president of crypto custodian company Anchorage Trust, where he expressed his concerns that other parts of the world are \u201cdwarfing\u201d the United States in innovative payment technologies. Cointelegraph reported that the Senator was puzzled to see that his colleagues reacted with such hostility to the creation of Facebook\u2019s Libra stablecoin.
