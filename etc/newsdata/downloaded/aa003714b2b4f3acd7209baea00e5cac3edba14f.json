The 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage averaged 3.4%, up five basis points from a week ago.\n\nMortgage rates roughly track the direction of the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.58%, the yield on which has roughly stayed the same over the past week.\n\n\u201cThe outlook for a favorable resolution to the trade dispute between the U.S. and China is still unclear, introducing some volatility into financial markets and the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield,\u201d Sam Khater, Freddie Mac\u2019s chief economist, said in the report. \u201cMortgage rates are following suit at near historic lows, while mortgage applications to purchase a home remain higher year over year.\u201d\n\nEven though mortgage rates have risen from the 2019 low recorded at the beginning of September, they remain more than a full percentage point below where they were at this point last year. That\u2019s helped those home buyers who may have struggled to meet the repayment requirements.\n\nAffordability and the overall strength of the economy nevertheless remain significant headwinds for the housing market. But recent data suggests that some additional relief may be on the horizon, at least where high home prices are concerned.\n\nThe median sales price of newly-constructed homes dropped in September below $300,000, which economists said could be an indication that home builders are constructing homes at the cheaper end of the market.\n\nThat would be good news for first-time home buyers who have faced the most competition in the housing market, driving up home prices in the process.", "description": "Nevertheless, affordability may be improving for home buyers.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT945_moving_ZG_20191024115112.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
