I say all credit is for him. He\u2019s a guy whose physicality is incredible.\n\n\u201cThe day after a game, he could play another. He can play both sides, he\u2019s fast, defensively he helps us a lot, he\u2019s an extraordinary player.\u201d\n\nCity fell behind to a Ruslan Malinovsky penalty but reacted by stepping up the tempo after a slow start to overwhelm their visitors and make it three wins from three in the pool. They will seal a knockout place with a win at Atalanta on Nov. 6.\n\n\u201cIt was an incredible effort because Atalanta have a lot of quality. They are a top team. That\u2019s why I am so satisfied. Nine points, we need one more win to be in the next stage.\u201d\n\nThe only blemish on the night was a red card for teenager Foden, who had been excellent until two sloppy pieces of play saw him collect a couple of yellow cards in a six minute spell.\n\nBut Guardiola backed the 19-year-old and says it will be a lesson for him.\n\n\u201cWith Phil, the important thing is not the red card but the way he played. He has to be a bit more clever when he has the first yellow.\n\n\u201cHe has to live this kind of situation to understand. The first yellow card, be careful. The result was 5-1, but it could have been different if it had been 2-1 or 3-1. That experience is going to help him.\u201d", "description": "Pep Guardiola says hat-trick hero Raheem Sterling can still improve further and it will be up to the Manchester City forward as to whether he fulfils his potential and becomes a great of the game.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444025485&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0ID", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
