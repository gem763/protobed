So, this April I got a lazy Susan for my refrigerator and \u2014 as someone whose life revolves around sauces, dips, and chutneys \u2014 it has been a revelation. I first spotted the idea on a friend\u2019s Instagram: He posted a video of his fridge, with an acrylic disc of rotating jars of tasty treats. It was like ASMR for people who love to accessorise their dinner. My fridge, once heaving with gently mouldering jars lurking in dark corners, is now nicely organised with everything at my disposal with just a small whirl of the wheel. It\u2019s so useful to be able to see all your tracklements and pickles at a glance, from the put-it-on-everything stuff like Lao Gan Ma Chilli Crisp, to the what-even-is-this jar of homemade chutney that you\u2019re kind of too scared to use.\n\nI posted about my new lazy Susan on the internet, and my DMs were flooded with people who wanted to do the same. Multiple people are getting in on the game. Author of Chinatown Kitchen Lizzie Mabbot tweeted about her L-Suze (is that gonna catch on?) and even food writer Diana Henry got bitten by the lazy-Susan bug.\n\nMy friend\u2019s original lazy Susan is one like this set of two, but I also wanted the largest capacity possible to maximise condiment space. I scrolled through myriad options \u2014 at one point I even considered making one (I have a ceramics sideline), which is ridiculous \u2014 until I found this one by iDesign, which has a 2cm lip, which means I can grab something without having to lift it over the lip of the lazy Susan. I\u2019ve also heard great things about this Oxo Good Grips turntable \u2014 and frankly, when have they ever made a bad kitchen product? I\u2019m no Mrs. Hinch \u2014 I haven\u2019t cleaned it since I bought mine, but it does come apart very easily should you wish to give it a scrub.\n\nWant to join the Susan shindig? Measure your fridge shelf to see what size you can get. A word of caution: Even if you measure up your fridge shelf like I did, check your door shelves. I had to rearrange them so I could shut the fridge door, but it was worth it. I can now easily access all my condiments, which should hopefully save me from the horror of opening a mouldy jar of olives. Now I\u2019m keen to bring the lazy Susan into all parts of my home: one for my similarly overflowing beauty stash, and maybe one to organise those millions of tins of tomatoes or chickpeas in the cupboard.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
