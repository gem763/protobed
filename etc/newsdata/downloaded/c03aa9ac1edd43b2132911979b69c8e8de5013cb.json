The government's lawyers will then respond.\n\nBBC legal affairs correspondent Clive Coleman said it was only the second time 11 justices would sit - the first time this happened was in Ms Miller's successful challenge as to whether the prime minister or Parliament should trigger Article 50 to start the process for leaving the EU.\n\nHe added that they will determine whether prorogation is a matter for the courts.\n\nIf they decide it is, they will go on to rule definitively on whether Mr Johnson's true motive in advising the Queen was to undermine MPs' ability to legislate and respond to events as the country prepares to leave the EU, our correspondent added.\n\nSpeaking on Monday, Mr Johnson said the EU had had \"a bellyful\" of the Brexit process and wanted to get a deal in order to move on to the next phase of talks on future relations.\n\nBut after meeting his counterpart, Luxembourg's PM attacked the prime minister's approach to Brexit, calling the situation a \"nightmare\".\n\nAfter Mr Johnson pulled out of the joint press conference with Mr Bettel, the Luxembourg PM proceeded to appear at the conference without his British counterpart.\n\nA UK government source said on Monday that the gap the UK and Brussels needed to bridge to achieve a Brexit deal on the terms of the UK's exit \"remains quite large\".", "description": "The Supreme Court will hear two appeals that will determine whether the PM acted lawfully in suspending Parliament.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07nj8tf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
