(Deb Lindsey/For The Washington Post)\n\n8. Poca Madre\n\n(Excellent)\n\nIf you want to chart how far this Mexican hideaway has traveled since it opened, ask for the charred cabbage. Singed leaves might not sound like a game-changer, but they sure taste like one when they\u2019re arranged with spoonfuls of shredded oxtail \u201cjam\u201d on a pale green, heat-packing mole that fairly pulses with cilantro, mint and ground seeds. My point: Vegetables are getting starring roles, and meat is being used more like a garnish. Indeed, one of the most enticing ceviches here revolves around mango compressed with chiles and lime and finished with candied Fresno pepper and dark splotches of charred habanero oil, an accent chef-owner Victor Albisu likes so much he says, \u201cI put it on everything,\u201d even eggs at breakfast.\n\nThe chef has a playful side. \u201cEverything\u201d infladita stuffs smoked whitefish in delicate fried tortilla cups, and panko-crisped halibut gets slipped between a steamed bun slathered with chipotle cream. It\u2019s a Filet-0-Fish, s\u00ed, but superior in every way to the one at McDonald\u2019s. If there\u2019s one dish Albisu says he can\u2019t take off the list, it\u2019s fried chicken set on a much-improved black mole enriched with foie gras. All the dish needs is a sparkling salad to counter the decadence, and that it gets, along with excellent blue corn tortillas.\n\n\n\nDiners at the bar area at Poca Madre.

Want to hear an inside joke? While Albisu vowed never to serve burritos at his fast-casual Taco Bamba, he\u2019s peddling a blingy bundle here: house-made tortillas rolled up with sweet lobster, wagyu beef, Arborio rice and caviar and priced at $32. People love it or not, unlike the rest of dinner here, where a gratis cocktail, likely incorporating mezcal, eases you into the elegant-but-relaxed dining room, which exemplifies upscale dining in 2018.\n\n2.5 stars\n\nPoca Madre: 777 I St. NW. 202-838-5300. pocamadredc.com.\n\nOpen: Dinner daily.\n\nPrice: Mains $18-$24.\n\nSound check: 70 decibels / Conversation is easy.\n\n--\n\nThe following review originally published July 25, 2018.\n\n\n\nThe Ziggy Stardust Margarita. (Deb Lindsey/For the Washington Post)\n\nChef-owner Victor Albisu at Poca Madre. (Deb Lindsey/For the Washington Post)\n\nA chef steeped in tacos takes Mexican cuisine on an upscale ride\n\n(Good/Excellent)\n\nLet me say from the start that I\u2019m not a fan of deconstructed food, which almost always suffers in comparison to the dish as it\u2019s typically prepared, which is to say complete. Why make diners work \u2014 push this ingredient against that one, insert A into B and possibly C \u2014 to get some semblance of the full effect?\n\nVictor Albisu has me reconsidering my position. He\u2019s the chef-owner behind the recently introduced Poca Madre, a fresh take on Mexican cooking in Washington and the source of a first course called Not \u201cGuacamole.\u201d The dish, says a waiter, shares the flavors, if not the look, of the popular green dip.\n\nSure enough, Not \u201cGuacamole\u201d arrives looking more like a salad than the standard mash. The trick is to introduce a bit of avocado \u2014 warm and gently crisp in a sheath of tempura \u2014 to the other elements in the bowl, including blistered shishito and epazote, making sure to dress whatever you\u2019ve speared on your fork with the tangy citrus juice and minced tomato, onion and jalape\u00f1o pooled in the bottom of the bowl. Tortilla chips need not apply; the crackle of the tempura fills the role beautifully. The revised guacamole, warm and pulsing with flavors that play off one another, fairly dares you to go back to the traditional bowl.\n\nI\u2019m no fortuneteller, but something tells me \u201cNot\u201d is going to be hot.\n\n\n\nNot \u201cGuacamole.\u201d (Deb Lindsey/For the Washington Post)\n\nShrimp and cuttlefish ceviche. (Deb Lindsey/For the Washington Post)\n\nPoca Madre replaces the left flank of Del Campo, Albisu\u2019s dashing South American grill, which closed in March near Chinatown after a five-year run. The remaining space is devoted to Taco Bamba, the chef\u2019s rousing fast-casual concept. The restaurants share an address and a kitchen but maintain separate entrances. The door to Poca Madre opens to a narrow room with seating on multiple levels and a small bar that dispenses a gratis, nightly changing libation, most recently a restorative shot of mezcal blended with Aperol, honey and lime. That and some nubby, CD-size corn tostadas, delivered with a zesty salsa, hint of good things to come.\n\nAnd that they do. Along with the rethought guacamole, dinner should commence with cuttlefish and shrimp that have been transformed into broad \u201cnoodles\u201d and labeled ceviche with the help of abundant fresh herbs and coconut milk swirled with lime juice. As the \u201cpasta\u201d is being devoured, a minder comes over and pours a splash of smoky mezcal into the bowl, encouraging us to taste the broth anew. If lightning in the tropics could be captured as a flavor, this would be it. The table should also be introduced to the very good corn risotto, punched up with epazote leaves, ringed with cotija and popcorn to accentuate the featured attraction, and finished with dots of huitlacoche puree and shaved Oregon truffles, a reminder, should you need one, that you\u2019re not eating at Guapo\u2019s. (Poca Madre is the uncommon Mexican restaurant to offer wine from the country, samples of which servers are happy to pour.)\n\nOctopus has overtaken tuna tartare as the most everywhere appetizer in contemporary restaurants, which gets no complaints from me when the creature is served as originally as at Poca Madre. The kitchen braises the octopus so it\u2019s tender, then crisps it with a plunge in the fryer. The result is brushed with squid ink, sprinkled with sesame seeds and stacked on a white mole whipped up from almonds, plantains, habanero and white chocolate. Eat and repeat until the lot is no more.\n\nThe contemporary setting, by designer Maggie O\u2019Neill of Swatchroom, makes a seductive frame for the food. Look up and you see plants intertwined with a string of lights, or fixtures in the shape of outsize sombreros. Behind the host stand is a painting of \u201cBorder Door,\u201d the 1988 photograph by artist Richard Lou depicting the U.S.-Mexican border. The stark image is meant to convey inclusiveness, says Albisu, whose background is Cuban and Peruvian and whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and travels have steeped him in Mexican culture.\n\nHere and there, Albisu shows his cheeky side. Take the name of the place: Poca Madre (literally, \u201clittle mother\u201d) is Spanish slang for \u201ccool,\u201d says the chef. He also found a clever way to add a burrito to his refined collection of dishes, and justify the bundle\u2019s $32 price. Inside two upright towers of housemade flour tortillas, one finds sweet lobster, succulent Wagyu beef, a binder of black beans pureed with avocado leaves and truffles and fancy Arborio rice \u2014 an extravaganza capped with a garnish of shimmering caviar. Excessive? Sure. Delicious? Same. The chef says he happened to think up the indulgence while watching the HBO documentary \u201cElvis Presley: The Searcher.\u201d Hence the name for the dish \u2014 \u201cThe King\u201d \u2014 and a plate emblazoned with the singer\u2019s portrait.\n\nOf course, there are large plates for sharing. If you haven\u2019t noticed that restaurants of all stripes want you to share, share, share, where have you been eating? At Poca Madre, the most intriguing platter features a whole duck that has been slow-cooked and made luscious with pineapple, chipotle and mild and fruity guajillo chile. The fall-apart feast comes with an herb salad, a nice pause between bites of the rich duck. Almost as good is pork festooned with red bell peppers, mint and cilantro and positioned atop eggplant crema.\n\n\n\nCorn risotto with huitlacoche, truffles and popcorn. (Deb Lindsey/For the Washington Post)\n\nSweetbreads Veracruzana. (Deb Lindsey/For the Washington Post)\n\nThe most memorable dessert originates from the bar, where liquid nitrogen creates the fog and chill that distinguishes Ziggy Stardust \u2014 imagine snow crossed with a mezcal margarita \u2014 from the other cocktails. A roll call of summer fruit, also chilled, lends its beauty to the arrangement, my first-ever \u201cdrink\u201d to be served on a plate and eaten with a spoon.\n\nThe cloying sweetness that permeated much of the cooking in the restaurant\u2019s early days is for the most part gone. One place where the problem lingers is the dark mole that serves as a base for otherwise pleasing fried chicken. Albisu says he created enough dishes for several menus, but was kept in check by his cooking team; the one combination I wouldn\u2019t be sorry to see go pairs a whip of goat cheese and avocado with white anchovies sprinkled with crushed chapulines (fried grasshoppers, a popular snack in parts of Mexico). The elements, designed to be eaten on tortillas, seem forced on one another.\n\nThe bill for dinner can sting. If you like to drink, and if you order more than a few small plates per person, $100 a head is not uncommon.\n\nThen again, the restaurant shouldn\u2019t be confused with any other Mexican establishment in Washington. Albisu is offering an elevated experience at Poca Madre.
