It consists of essentially the same terms as the Korea-EU FTA.\n\nKorea's main exports like cars and parts can still be shipped to the U.K. without tariffs.\n\nWhile the U.K. remains in the EU, 99.6 percent of goods exported to the U.K. are benefiting from Korea's tariff-free trade with the EU. But if Brexit had become a reality without a deal, 4.73 percent tariffs could have been imposed on Korean goods.\n\n\"The FTA is important because the two countries can maintain continuity and stability of bilateral trade relations even in a no-deal Brexit scenario in which the U.K. unilaterally withdraws from the EU,\" a ministry spokesman said.\n\n", "description": "Korea, U.K. Sign Post-Brexit FTA", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-08-23"}
