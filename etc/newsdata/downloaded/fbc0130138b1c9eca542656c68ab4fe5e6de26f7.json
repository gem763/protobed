The percentage rise, however, may be less than 10 percent as the daily chart is reporting signs of buyer exhaustion.\n\nA triangle breakdown on the hourly chart, if confirmed, could yield a pullback to support at $8,820.\n\nA high-volume contracting triangle breakout will likely yield a re-test of recent highs above $10,000.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is on track to end a three-month losing streak, having recovered from recent lows around $7,400 seen a week ago.\n\nThe number one cryptocurrency is currently priced at $9,200 on Bitstamp \u2013 up 11 percent from the Oct. 1 opening price of $8,304.\n\nIf confirmed, the close would mark the first monthly gain since June, as the cryptocurrency fell by 6.27, 4.8 and 13.51 percent in July, August and September, respectively. The three-month losing trend was the longest since January 2018.\n\nBitcoin fell by 6.27 percent in July, ending the five-month run of gains, which saw prices climb from $4,000 to $13,880.\n\nThe October rise would be the sixth monthly gain of 2019.\n\nIt is worth noting that BTC was trading at four-month lows below $7,400 a week ago and appeared set to post a loss for the fourth consecutive month.\n\nThe tide, however, turned in favor of the bulls on Friday and Saturday, when bitcoin shot up 42 percent from $7,500 to $10,350.\n\nThe monthly gain would have been in excess of 20 percent had the cryptocurrency held on to gains above $10,000. BTC, however, quickly fell back into four figures and has witnessed solid two-way business in the range of $9,950 \u2013$9,050 in the last 48 hours.\n\nThe technical charts indicate the probability of BTC falling all the way back below the monthly opening price of $8,304 is low. However, prices could fall to former resistance-turned-support of $8,820, in which case the monthly gain would be less than 10 percent.\n\nHourly chart\n\nBTC has carved out a low-volume narrowing price range or contracting triangle on the hourly chart. A dip below the lower edge, currently at $9,100, would confirm a triangle breakdown and could accelerate the correction to $8,820.\n\nA violation there would expose next support lined up at $8,474 (horizontal line), although a sustained drop below $8,820 looks unlikely.\n\nBitcoin would likely challenge recent highs above $10,000 if the contracting triangle ends with a high-volume breakout. At time of writing, the upper edge of the triangle is seen at $9,500.\n\nDaily and 4-hour charts\n\nThe repeated failure to hold on to gains above the 100-day moving average and Monday\u2019s daily red candle with the long upper shadow indicate buyer exhaustion.\n\nFurther, the 4-hour line chart is showing a channel breakdown, meaning consolidation has ended with a downside break, opening the doors for a deeper pullback.\n\nTherefore, the probability of BTC diving out of the narrowing price range on the hourly chart is high.\n\nMonthly and weekly charts\n\nBitcoin closed well below the July low of $9,049 in September (above left), confirming a downside break of the narrowing price range.\n\nThe bearish pattern is still valid as prices are holding well below the September high of $10,949.\n\nTraders, however, need not wait for a bull market confirmation above $10,949 and could adopt a bullish stance if prices manage to end the week (Sunday, UTC) above $9,725. That would confirm a falling channel breakout on the weekly chart (above right).\n\nDisclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.\n\nBitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_707150032.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
