This compares to earnings of $0.81 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7.06%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this airport security and full-body scanner manufacturer would post earnings of $1.05 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.15, delivering a surprise of 9.52%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nOSI, which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Components industry, posted revenues of $290.85 million for the quarter ended September 2019, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.14%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $266.25 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nOSI shares have added about 31.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 19.9%.\n\nWhat's Next for OSI?\n\nWhile OSI has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for OSI was favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future.
