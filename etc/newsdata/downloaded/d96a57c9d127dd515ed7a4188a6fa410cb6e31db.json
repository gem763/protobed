The camera panned away from him seconds later.\n\nDuring the halftime report at the game between the Lakers and Clippers, a protester waved an enormous red Hong Kong flag immediately behind the TNT broadcast booth.\n\nIn the pregame show, NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O\u2019Neal, part of the TNT broadcast team, declared that, \u201cDaryl Morey was right,\u201d referring to the Houston Rockets general manager whose pro-Hong Kong tweet ignited a cancellation of Rockets broadcasts and sponsorships in China.\n\n\u201cAs American people, we do a lot of business in China,\u201d O\u2019Neal said. \u201cAnd they know and understand our values and we understand their values. And one of our best values in America is free speech. We\u2019re allowed to say what we want to say, and we\u2019re allowed to speak up on injustices, and that\u2019s just how it goes.\u201d\n\n\ud83c\udded\ud83c\uddf0 First NBA Halftime report and we have a Hong Kong flag.

And I think this is a very difficult thing that the NBA is going through right now.\u201d\n\nLakers superstar LeBron James was roundly decried earlier this month for saying Morey \u201cwasn\u2019t educated\u201d on the situation.\n\nThe NBA was slammed for an initial statement calling Morey\u2019s tweet \u201cregrettable,\u201d but since then the league has steadily strengthened its stance in support of free speech.\n\nIn a TIME100 interview on Thursday, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said he was asked by Chinese officials to fire Morey, and that he refused.\n\n\u201cObviously we made clear that \u2014 we were being asked to fire him, by the Chinese government, by the parties we dealt with, government and business,\u201d Silver said. \u201cAnd we said there\u2019s no chance that\u2019s happening. There\u2019s no chance we\u2019ll even discipline him.\u201d\n\nThe NBA may have caught a break Wednesday in Hong Kong, where the government formally withdrew its fugitive extradition bill, the catalyst for months of pro-democracy protests that saw hundreds of thousands take to the streets.\n\nThe withdrawal may signal a retreat by China, or it could mean a regrouping before another effort to chip away at the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy between China and its \u201cspecial administrative region.\u201d\n\nWhat can China \u2014 or the NBA \u2014 do about the game-day protests? Not much, Dong said.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t tell fans at the door, you\u2019ve got to take that T-shirt off, or you can\u2019t express yourself in the game, because then they would encounter a domestic backlash,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd American fans and Canadian fans would just disappear, and say, what, are you going to tell us that we now have to conform to Chinese rules? Are you an American sports organization or a Chinese sports organization?\u201d\n\nHe said the most the NBA can do is keep cameras off those sporting political shirts or signs during games.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s not going to be happy, but this whole episode demonstrates why Hong Kongers are fighting,\u201d Dong said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, this is what China does, they\u2019re trying to restrict free expression and free speech, and China\u2019s reaction to this whole NBA debacle shows it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
