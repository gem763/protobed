The sign will be open to the public but also protected by a gate and surveillance cameras, according to the memorial\u2019s commission.\n\nAbout 100 people, including members of Till's family, attended the rededication ceremony, Weems said.\n\n\"Our community for 50 years was silent around what happened to Emmett Till, both the murder and later the injustice,\" Weems said. \"It was just a really powerful day to have our community leaders, both black and white, from Tallahatchie County, along with the Till family, to kind of put a stake in the ground and say: 'We\u2019re going to be resilient and continue to tell this story despite the vandalism.' \"\n\nA 500-pound, bulletproof sign was unveiled Saturday at the site where civil rights icon Emmett Till was pulled from the Tallahatchie River.

Carolyn Bryant Donham, a white 21-year-old shopkeeper in the town of Money, Mississippi, had said Till grabbed and wolf-whistled at her. An all-white, all-male jury in Mississippi acquitted two white men accused of the slaying.\n\nSince the first memorial was erected at the site in 2008, Till signs have been vandalized multiple times, including with spray paint and acid.\n\nEmmett Till More\n\nVandals threw the first sign in the river. The second sign was blasted with 317 bullets or shotgun pellets before officials from the Emmett Till Memorial Commission removed it. The third sign, a 50-pound marker, was removed in July after the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting and ProPublica uncovered a photo of three Ole Miss students posing with guns in front of the sign, riddled once again with bullets.\n\nInvestigation: 3 Ole Miss students posed with guns in front of Emmett Till's memorial. DOJ may investigate\n\nThe students have since been suspended from their fraternity house and face possible investigation by the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nThe commission said it hopes to use Till's murder to spark conversations about racism and pursue racial reconciliation, but the vandalism has \"severely hampered\" those efforts.\n\n\"We\u2019re not naive enough to think that this is the last time that someone tries something,\" Weems said. \"We\u2019re hoping with these new modifications this will kind of symbolically be resilient and physically be resilient to overcome any type of vandalism that happens in the future.\"\n\nHe said the commission's ultimate hope is to develop the land by the river and have it designated as a national park. Vandalism at national parks is prohibited by federal law.\n\n'It\u2019s out of reach to would-be vandals': Emmett Till was murdered in Mississippi in 1955.
