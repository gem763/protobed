Comments from a high ranking government official on a U.S.-China trade deal are also helping to underpin prices.\n\nAt 08:14 GMT, December WTI crude oil futures are trading $53.12, down $0.33 or -0.62% and December Brent crude oil is at $59.15, down $0.27 or -0.45%.\n\nBrexit Outcome Worries\n\nWTI and Brent crude oil prices may be treading water over Brexit concerns as Britain and the European Union scramble to secure a last-minute Brexit deal. Traders are saying that anything that isn\u2019t a hard Brexit is likely to be positive for crude oil prices.\n\nAmerican Petroleum Institute Weekly Inventories Report\n\nLate Wednesday, one day later than usual, the API reported a major crude oil inventory build of 10.45 million barrels for the week-ending October 10. Traders were looking for a much smaller 2.878-million-barrel build.\n\nAfter Wednesday\u2019s data release, the net draw for the year is 15.27 million barrels for the 42-week reporting period so far, using API data.\n\nThe API also reported a draw of 934,000 barrels of gasoline for the week-ending October 10. Analysts had predicted a larger draw in gasoline inventories of 1.381 million barrels for the week. Distillate inventories fell by 2.862 million barrels for the week, while inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma futures hub, rose by 1.648 million barrels.\n\nU.S.-China Trade Relations\n\nAlthough a general lack of clarity over the partial trade deal between the United States and China on Friday has been weighing on prices all week, traders were a little more upbeat early Thursday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators are working on nailing down a Phase 1 trade deal text for their presidents to sign next month.\n\nDaily Forecast\n\nThere are some who believe the market has reached a balance point in terms of price because crude oil has been holding above its multi-month low reached in early August. They are calling the chart pattern constructive.\n\nHowever, prices are likely to remain under pressure on Thursday if today\u2019s U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report confirms the bearish numbers in the API report, released late Tuesday. Traders are looking for a 2.8 million barrel build, however, this estimate may rise ahead of its release at 14:30 GMT. If confirmed, the market is going to have a hard time rallying unless there is a surprise Brexit announcement, or further official upbeat comments over U.S.-China trade relations.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "Prices are likely to remain under pressure on Thursday if today\u2019s U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report confirms the bearish numbers in the API report, released late Tuesday.
