It was instant attraction and he was the first guy I\u2019d connected with since my divorce two years ago.\n\nFor the first month or so things were perfect, but then he started being around less and making excuses for why he couldn\u2019t see me.\n\nI knew he was carrying a lot of baggage from three previous marriages (yes, three!).\n\nHe claims his first wife was an alcoholic, his second cheated on him and that he married his third on\n\nthe rebound.\n\nThen about three months into our relationship, he told me he was leaving me for someone else he\u2019d known\n\na while.\n\nI was shocked and hurt, but decided I had to move on, but two weeks later he came back with a grovelling apology and we got back together.\n\nSince then, he\u2019s walked out several times \u2013 it\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t know what he wants from one day to the next. I really like him, but I\u2019m not sure I can cope with this constant uncertainty.\n\nMy grown-up kids think I\u2019m mad to keep seeing him, but I just keep hoping he\u2019ll get himself together.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nColeen says\n\nI think your kids could be right! It doesn\u2019t sound to me as if he\u2019s never really known what he wants. Also, you\u2019re only hearing one side of the story from him about why his marriages ended \u2013 and he ran into\n\nthe arms of someone else just three months into your relationship.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard when you have \u00adfeelings for someone, but sometimes you have to wake up and put yourself first. He clearly has major commitment issues, which you\u2019re very unlikely to be able to fix. In fact, he might need\n\nyears in therapy to work through his relationship issues.\n\nIt\u2019s a very stressful way to live, always wondering when he\u2019s going to walk out or come back \u2013 do you really want that for your future?\n\nI think it\u2019d be far easier to cut the ties now than a year or more down the line. And perhaps if it\u2019s you who walks away \u2013 and you explain why you can\u2019t carry on in the relationship \u2013 he\u2019ll realise you are important to him and he does want to be with you. But don\u2019t put your life on hold in the meantime.\n\nI really think you need some proper time apart and you might find that you\u2019re actually far happier on your own. After going through a divorce and making a new life for yourself, you deserve a lot better.", "description": "The first time was about three months into our relationship, when he told me he was leaving me for someone else he\u2019d known a while", "authors": ["Coleen Nolan", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20715447.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Couple-looking-serious-on-the-bed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
