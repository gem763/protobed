This is going to take a few days,\" Terrazas said during a Friday morning news briefing, adding that the fire was still zero per cent contained.\n\nTwo major highways have been closed due to the flames.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued red flag fire condition warnings for Los Angeles and Ventura counties, cautioning of wind gusts of up to 75mph in the mountains and 55mph by the coasts.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reports 100,000 people live in the evacuation area.\n\nAuthorities have opened shelters for residents forced to abandon their homes.\n\nThe Saddleridge fire started on Thursday night in the San Fernando Valley and has since begun encroaching into northern neighbourhoods of the city. It remains unclear how it started.\n\nIt is one of several fires currently burning in southern California.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nThe blaze sparked by the garbage truck in Calimesa - a city some 70 miles east of Los Angeles - has spread to 500 acres and destroyed 74 structures, according to officials.\n\nThat outbreak, dubbed the Sandalwood fire after a local landmark, was 10% contained as of Thursday night.\n\nAt least two other smaller wildfires prompted evacuations on Thursday as well.\n\nUp in the north of the state this week, power company PG&E cut electricity to parts of 22 counties, including portions of the San Francisco Bay Area, as a wildfire prevention method.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Embers from the fire have been spread across the hillside due to the strong winds\n\nThe planned outage was to prevent power lines felled by strong winds sparking fires. Last year, PG&E's fallen power lines started the deadliest wildfire in California's history.\n\nPG&E has now begun restoring power, though more than 300,000 customers remained in the dark as of Thursday night.\n\nThe outages have been difficult for many residents, but particularly those with medical and health needs.\n\nLocal media report that many breastfeeding mothers have been banding together, connecting via online groups to share access to freezers and tips on how to store milk.", "description": "One of the fires was sparked by a bin lorry that dumped burning rubbish near tinder-dry vegetation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1729F/production/_109197849_tv057225894.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
