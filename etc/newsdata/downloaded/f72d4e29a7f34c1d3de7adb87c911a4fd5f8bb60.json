He was one of 90 people who had been summoned, sued by the local hospital, or doctors, or an ambulance service over unpaid bills. Some wore eye patches and bandages; others limped to their seats by the wood-paneled walls. Biggs, who is 41, had to take a day off from work to be there. He knew from experience that if he didn\u2019t show up, he could be put in jail.\n\nBefore the morning\u2019s hearing, he listened as defendants traded stories. One woman recalled how, at four months pregnant, she had reported a money order scam to her local sheriff\u2019s office only to discover that she had a warrant; she was arrested on the spot. A radiologist had sued her over a $230 bill, and she\u2019d missed one hearing too many. Another woman said she watched, a decade ago, as a deputy came to the door for her diabetic aunt and took her to jail in her final years of life. Now here she was, dealing with her own debt, trying to head off the same fate.\n\nBiggs, who is tall and broad-shouldered, with sun-scorched skin and bright hazel eyes, looked up as defendants talked, but he was embarrassed to say much. His court dates had begun after his son developed leukemia, and they\u2019d picked up when his wife started having seizures. He, too, had been arrested because of medical debt. It had happened more than once.\n\nSign up to get ProPublica\u2019s investigations delivered to your inbox.

He is a cattle rancher who was appointed a magistrate judge, though he\u2019d never taken a course in law. Judges don\u2019t need a law degree in Kansas, or many other states, to preside over cases like these. Casement asked the defendants to take an oath and confirmed that the newcomers confessed to their debt. A key purpose of the hearing, though, was for patients to face debt collectors. \u201cThey want to talk to you about trying to set up a payment plan, and after you talk with them, you are free to go,\u201d he told the debtors. Then, he left the room.\n\nThe first collector of the day was also the most notorious: Michael Hassenplug, a private attorney representing doctors and ambulance services. Every three months, Hassenplug called the same nonpaying defendants to court to list what they earned and what they owned \u2014 to testify, quite often, to their poverty. It gave him a sense of his options: to set up a payment plan, to garnish wages or bank accounts, to put a lien on a property. It was called a \u201cdebtor\u2019s exam.\u201d\n\nIf a debtor missed an exam, the judge typically issued a citation of contempt, a charge for disobeying an order of the court, which in this case was to appear. If the debtor missed a hearing on contempt, Hassenplug would ask the judge for a bench warrant. As long as the defendant had been properly served, the judge\u2019s answer was always yes. In practice, this system has made Hassenplug and other collectors the real arbiters of who gets arrested and who is shown mercy. If debtors can post bail, the judge almost always applies the money to the debt. Hassenplug, like any collector working on commission, gets a cut of the cash he brings in.\n\nCrystal Dyke with her husband and two kids outside their home in Leroy, Kansas. She was arrested when she was pregnant because she missed hearings involving a $230 radiologist bill.\n\nAcross the country, thousands of people are jailed each year for failing to appear in court for unpaid bills, in arrangements set up much like this one. The practice spread in the wake of the recession as collectors found judges willing to use their broad powers of contempt to wield the threat of arrest. Judges have issued warrants for people who owe money to landlords and payday lenders, who never paid off furniture, or day care fees, or federal student loans. Some debtors who have been arrested owed as little as $28.\n\nMore than half of the debt in collections stems from medical care, which, unlike most other debt, is often taken on without a choice or an understanding of the costs. Since the Affordable Care Act of 2010, prices for medical services have ballooned; insurers have nearly tripled deductibles \u2014 the amount a person pays before their coverage kicks in \u2014 and raised premiums and copays, as well. As a result, tens of millions of people without adequate coverage are expected to pay larger portions of their rising bills.\n\nThe sickest patients are often the most indebted, and they\u2019re not exempt from arrest. In Indiana, a cancer patient was hauled away from home in her pajamas in front of her three children; too weak to climb the stairs to the women\u2019s area of the jail, she spent the night in a men\u2019s mental health unit where an inmate smeared feces on the wall. In Utah, a man who had ignored orders to appear over an unpaid ambulance bill told friends he would rather die than go to jail; the day he was arrested, he snuck poison into the cell and ended his life.\n\nIn jurisdictions with lax laws and willing judges, jail is the logical endpoint of a system that has automated the steps from high bills to debt to court, and that has given collectors power that is often unchecked. I spent several weeks this summer in Coffeyville, reviewing court files, talking to dozens of patients and interviewing those who had sued them. Though the district does not track how many of these cases end in arrest, I found more than 30 warrants issued against medical debt defendants. At least 11 people were jailed in the past year alone.\n\nWith hardly any oversight, even by the presiding judge, collection attorneys have turned this courtroom into a government-sanctioned shakedown of the uninsured and underinsured, where the leverage is the debtors\u2019 liberty.\n\nThe courtroom where Hassenplug and other collectors administer \u201cdebtor\u2019s exams.\u201d\n\nSeated at the front of the courtroom, Hassenplug zipped open his leather binder and uncapped his fountain pen. He is stout, with a pinkish nose and a helmet of salt and pepper hair. His opening case this Tuesday involved 28-year-old Kenneth Maggard, who owed more than $2,000, including interest and court fees, for a 40-mile ambulance ride last year. Maggard had downed most of a bottle of Purple Power Industrial Strength Cleaner, along with some 3M Super Duty Rubbing Compound, \u201cto end it all.\u201d His sister had called 911.\n\nMaggard took his seat. He had cropped red hair, pouchy cheeks and mud-caked sneakers. \u201cThe welfare patients are the most demanding, difficult patients on God\u2019s earth,\u201d Hassenplug told me, with Maggard listening, before launching into his interrogation: Are you working? No. Are you on disability? He was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, and anxiety. Do you have a car? No. Anyone owe you money you can collect? I wish.\n\nThey had been here before, and they both knew Maggard\u2019s disability checks were protected from collections. Hassenplug set down his pen. \u201cBetween you and me,\u201d he asked, \u201cyou\u2019re never going to pay this bill, are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, never,\u201d Maggard said. \u201cIf I had the money, I\u2019d pay it.\u201d\n\nHassenplug replied, \u201cWell, this will end when one of us dies.\u201d\n\nThough debt collection filings are soaring in parts of America, Hassenplug speaks with pride about how he discovered their full potential in Coffeyville long before. A transplant from Kansas City, he was a self-dubbed \u201cfour-star fuck-up\u201d who worked his way through law school. He moved to Coffeyville to practice in 1980 and soon earned a reputation as a hard ass. He saw that his firm, Becker, Hildreth, Eastman & Gossard, hadn\u2019t capitalized on its collections cases. The lawyers didn\u2019t demand sufficient payments, and they rarely followed up on litigation, he said. Where other attorneys saw petty work, Hassenplug saw opportunity.\n\nKenneth Maggard at his home. \u201cBlaze,\u201d painted below, is his son\u2019s name.\n\nHassenplug started collecting for doctors, dentists and veterinarians, but also banks and lumber yards and cities. He recognized that medical providers weren\u2019t being compensated for their services, and he was maddened by a \u201cwelfare mentality,\u201d as he called it, that allowed patients to dodge bills. \u201cTheir attitude a lot of times is, \u2018I\u2019m a single mom and \u2026 I\u2019m disabled and,\u2019 and the \u2018and\u2019 means \u2018the rules don\u2019t apply to me.\u2019 I think the rules apply to everybody,\u201d he told me.\n\nHe logged his cases in a computer to track them. First with the firm and later in his own practice, he took debtors to court, and he won nearly every time; in about 90% of cases nationally, collectors automatically win when defendants don\u2019t appear or contest the case. Hassenplug didn\u2019t need to accept $10 monthly payments; he could ask for more, or, in some cases, even garnish a quarter of a debtor\u2019s wages. His fee was, and often still is, one-third of what he collects. He asked the court to summon defendants, over and over again. It was the judge\u2019s contempt authority that backed him, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way you can get them into court.\u201d\n\nThe power of contempt was originally the power of kings. Under early English rule, monarchs were considered vicars of God, and disobeying them was equivalent to committing a sin. Over time, that contempt authority spread to English courts, and ultimately to American courts, which use it to encourage compliance with the judicial system. There is no law requiring that a court use civil contempt when an order isn\u2019t followed, but judges in the U.S. can choose to, whether it\u2019s to force a defendant to pay child support, for example, or show up at a hearing. A person jailed for defying a court order is generally released when they comply.\n\nWhen Casement took the bench in 1987, after passing a self-study exam, he didn\u2019t know much legalese \u2014 he had never been in a courtroom. But attorneys taught him early on that the power of contempt was available to him to punish people who ignored his orders. At first, Casement could see himself in the defendants. \u201cI was a much more pro-debtor aligned judge, much more sympathetic, much less inclined to do anything that I thought would burden them,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd over the years, I\u2019ve gradually moved to the other side of the fulcrum. I still consider myself very much in the middle, and I don\u2019t know if I am or not.\u201d\n\nOnce a bustling industrial hub, Coffeyville has a poverty rate that is double the national average, and its county ranks among the least healthy in Kansas. Its red-bricked downtown is lined with empty storefronts \u2014 former department stores, restaurants and shops. Its signature hotel is now used for low-income housing. \u201cThe two growth industries in Coffeyville,\u201d Hassenplug likes to say, \u201care health care and funerals.\u201d\n\nA shuttered motel in Coffeyville. The town, once a bustling industrial hub, now has a poverty rate more than double the national average.\n\nCoffeyville Regional Medical Center is the only hospital within a 40-mile radius, and it reported $1.5 million in uncollectible patient debt in 2017. A nonprofit run in a city-owned building, the hospital accounts for the vast majority of medical debt lawsuits in the county \u2014 about 2,000 in the past five years. It also accounts for the majority of related warrants. Account Recovery Specialists Inc. handles its collections, and it does so for hospitals in most Kansas counties. Though the hospitals can direct ARSI and its contracted attorneys to tell judges not to issue warrants, hardly any have. The Coffeyville hospital\u2019s attorney, Doug Bell, said that its only motivation is to continue to serve the area, and that Kansas\u2019 decision to not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act has had a \u201cdramatic effect on the economic liability of small rural hospitals.\u201d\n\nThree nearby hospitals in this rural region have closed in the past several years, meaning ambulances make more trips. A half-hour from Coffeyville, Independence runs its ambulance service at about a $300,000 annual loss. Its bills were at the root of four arrests this year alone. Derek Dustman, who is 36 and works odd jobs, had been driving a four-wheeler when he was hit by a car and rushed to the hospital. Though he was sued for not paying his $818 ambulance bill, he didn\u2019t have a license to drive to the courthouse. This spring, he spent two nights in jail. \u201cI never in a million years thought that this would end with jail time,\u201d he told me.\n\nFor years, Hassenplug has requested that the judge issue warrants on the ambulance service\u2019s behalf. When I asked Lacey Lies, the city\u2019s director of finance, if she ever considered telling him not to resort to bench warrants, she was puzzled. \u201cYou\u2019re saying an attorney with no teeth?\u201d\n\nA city ambulance in Independence, Kansas. Hassenplug represents the service against its debtors.\n\nThe first time Tres Biggs was arrested, in 2008, he was dove hunting in a grove outside Coffeyville. It had been just a year since his 6-year-old son Lane was diagnosed with leukemia, and Biggs watched him breathe in the fresh air, seated on a haybale under an orange sky. When a game warden came through to check hunting permits, Biggs\u2019 friends scattered and hid. He wasn\u2019t the running type, and he took Lane by the hand. The warden ran Biggs\u2019 license. There was a warrant out for his arrest. Biggs asked a friend to take Lane home and crouched into the warden\u2019s truck, scouring his memory for some misstep.\n\nThe last few years had been a blur. His wife, Heather, had quit her job as a babysitter to care for their son. Then, she got sick. Some days, she passed out or felt so dizzy she couldn\u2019t leave her bed. Her doctors didn\u2019t know if the attacks were linked to her heart condition, in which blood flowed backward through a valve. To provide for his wife, son and two other kids, Biggs worked two jobs, at a lumber yard and on construction sites. He didn\u2019t know when he would have had time to commit a crime. He\u2019d never been to jail. As he stared out the window at the rolling hills, his face began to sweat. He felt his skin tighten around him and wondered if he would be sick.\n\nThe warrant, he learned at the jailhouse, was for failure to appear in court for an unpaid hospital bill. Coffeyville Regional Medical Center had sued him in 2006 for $2,146, after one of Heather\u2019s emergency visits; neither of his jobs offered health insurance. In the shuffle of 70-hour workweeks and Lane\u2019s chemotherapy, he had missed two consecutive court dates. He was fingerprinted, photographed, made to strip and told to brace himself for a tub of delousing liquid. His bail was set at $500 cash; he had about $50 to his name.\n\nCoffeyville Regional Medical Center is the only hospital within a 40-mile radius.\n\nHis friend bailed him out the next morning, but at the bond hearing, the judge granted the $500, minus court fees, to the hospital. Biggs compensated his friend with a motorboat that a client had given him in exchange for a hunting dog. But it wasn\u2019t long before the family received a new summons. In 2009, a radiologist represented by Hassenplug sued them for $380.\n\nSome court hearings fell on days when Lane had treatment, at a hospital in Tulsa, an hour south. Heather refused to postpone his care. Lane\u2019s condition was improving \u2014 in a year, he would be cancer-free \u2014 and his dirty blond hair was sprouting again. Her health, though, had taken a turn. She began having weekly seizures, waking up on the floor, confused about where their Christmas tree had gone or why a red Catahoula puppy was skidding around their ranch house. Her doctors concluded she had Lyme disease, which was affecting her nervous system and wiping her short-term memory. Each time she woke up, she repeated: \u201cDon\u2019t take me to the hospital.\u201d\n\nBiggs was still on the hook for the bill that had landed him in jail; bail had covered only part of it, and the rest was growing with 12% annual interest. The hospital had garnished his wages, and the radiologist had garnished his bank account, seizing contributions that his family had raised for Lane\u2019s care. Living on $25,000 a year, Biggs couldn\u2019t afford to buy insurance. His family was on food stamps but didn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid, a federal insurance program for people in poverty. Other states were about to expand it to cover the working poor, but not Kansas, which limited it, for families of his size, to those who earned under $12,000. Like millions of others across America, he and Heather fell into a coverage gap.\n\nBy 2012, the Biggs family had accrued more than $70,000 in medical debt, which it owed to Coffeyville Regional Medical Center and other hospitals, pediatricians and neurologists. Some forgave it; others set up lenient payment plans. Coffeyville\u2019s was the only hospital that sued. The doctors who took them to court were represented by Hassenplug.\n\nTres Biggs with his wife, Heather, and son, Lane, at their home.\n\nBiggs began to panic around police, haunted by the fear that at any moment, he might be locked up. That spring, outside the Woodshed gas station, he spotted a sheriff\u2019s deputy who was also an old friend. To shake off his dread, he asked the friend to run his license. The deputy found another warrant, signed by Casement, involving the $380 radiologist\u2019s bill. \u201cYou\u2019re not really going to take me in, right?\u201d Biggs remembers asking. The deputy said he had no choice. Bail, as usual, was set at $500.\n\nThe family filed for bankruptcy, a short-term fix that erased their debt but burdened them with legal fees. They lost their home and started renting. Biggs ultimately got a job that offered insurance, as a rancher, covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield. But it required Biggs to pay the first $5,000 before it covered medical expenses. When chest pain hit him as he worked cattle in the heat, and he began vomiting, the only nearby hospital was Coffeyville\u2019s. In 2017, the hospital sued again. It was the family\u2019s sixth lawsuit for medical debt.\n\nSitting in Casement\u2019s courtroom this July, Biggs calculated that he was losing about $120 by taking time off from work to attend this hearing. \u201cI haven\u2019t received a bill,\u201d he told me, slouched over his turquoise shorts. \u201cThe only thing I received was this summons.\u201d Around noon, he finally sat down with an ARSI representative, who explained that the underlying bill had been garnished from his wages, but he still owed $328 in interest and court fees. He had another couple thousand dollars in collections for separate bills he hadn\u2019t paid, for which he hadn\u2019t yet been sued. He said the most he could afford to pay, every two weeks, was $12.50.\n\nBefore the end of the Tuesday docket, Casement returned to the courtroom to read off the names of the hospital\u2019s defendants. Five had failed to show up for contempt citations, to give their reasons for missing their debtor\u2019s exams. Casement saw that two of the no-shows hadn\u2019t been properly notified of the hearing, so attorneys would need to try to reach them again. The judge read the names of the other three defendants and told the hospital\u2019s collections lawyer, \u201cThat would be a bench warrant if you want it.\u201d\n\nThe following morning, I was reading court files in the clerks\u2019 office when Christa Strickland arrived at 10:20 in flip-flops and black leggings, her caramel hair wrapped in a bun atop her head. She ran her finger down a docket on the bulletin board and asked why her case wasn\u2019t listed. When the clerk pulled up her file, she told Strickland that her contempt hearing had been on Tuesday and she was one day late. \u201cYou need to call the law office of Amber Brehm,\u201d the clerk insisted, referring to ARSI\u2019s contracted lawyer, who represents the hospital. She handed over the phone number.\n\nStrickland sat on a hard bench and took out her cellphone. She had saved the hearing in the wrong day on her calendar, but she had taken the day off from work and wanted to clear up the misunderstanding. \u201cI had a court date,\u201d she said when a man answered at the law office. \u201cI thought it was today but apparently it was yesterday. I\u2019m just needing to see if I can set something up?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy not appearing at that, the court would be in the process of issuing a bench warrant,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Strickland asked, shaking her head.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what a bench warrant means?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat means you will be arrested and taken to jail and ordered to post bond.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my God.\u201d Strickland squeezed her eyes shut, wetness smudging her mascara. She poked at her cheek with her index finger. Her father was a preacher. She\u2019d never been in trouble with the law. She had made a mistake, she tried to explain. She wanted to make an arrangement to pay.\n\nThe Coffeyville courthouse.\n\nThe man on the phone told her that it might take a couple weeks before the court processed her warrant paperwork, which the law office had not yet submitted. Once the judge issued the warrant, she could turn herself in. Strickland wanted to scream, I\u2019ll pay the bill, don\u2019t make me go to jail! but she didn\u2019t have the money. Instead, she looked at the ceiling and asked: \u201cTurn myself into the court? The police station?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Sheriff\u2019s Department,\u201d he responded.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re here in the same building,\u201d she said. \u201cI won\u2019t leave here until I get this figured out. Thank you!\u201d\n\nShe hung up. Prick, she muttered to herself. You\u2019re going to talk to me like I\u2019m a freaking idiot? That\u2019s not okay. Educate me. The court has to process it? Her mind kept moving in circles. She herself worked in debt collection, for an auto title lending company. She understood that everyone was doing their job. Still, she couldn\u2019t grasp how this bill had gotten this far.\n\nBefore she had taken this position, during her second pregnancy, her right breast had developed a chronic infection. In 2008, she was uninsured, needed surgery to remove the swollen abscess and ran up a $2,514 bill. More than a decade later, she was still chipping away at a balance that, because of interest and court fees, had more than doubled to $5,736. She had fallen behind on her monthly payment plan and now worried that her booking photo would be on Mugshot Monday, a Facebook album run by the Police Department. She imagined what she would tell her boss: I went to jail \u2026 because I missed a court date \u2026 for medical bills. It sounded absurd.\n\nShe spotted a sheriff\u2019s deputy in a bulletproof vest with a name tag that said Bishop and a pistol on his hip. \u201cHey!\u201d she called out, explaining her phone call and how the man said something about a warrant and turning herself in. Bishop radioed into dispatch and smiled with an update: \u201cThere\u2019s no warrant in the system yet,\u201d he told her.\n\n\u201cYet!\u201d Strickland replied, deflating his look of reassurance. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m worrying about.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou better give Amber a call back,\u201d Bishop said.\n\nWhen I asked ARSI about how attorneys decide to request warrants, Joshua Shea, who is general counsel, told me that they don\u2019t. The judge can choose to issue one if court orders are not followed, he said. But Casement said the opposite, telling me that he gave the choice to the attorneys. \u201cI\u2019m not ordering a bench warrant. My decision is to give them that option,\u201d Casement told me. \u201cWhether they exercise it is up to them, but they have my blessing if that\u2019s what they want to do.\u201d\n\nShea sent me an eight-page email to make clear, in large part, that ARSI, as a collection agency, has no involvement in the courts, and that Brehm is a lawyer whom the agency contractually employs and who represents the hospital directly. Her email address, though, has an ARSI domain, and her resume lists her as ARSI\u2019s director of legal. Brehm said that court hearings aren\u2019t the only option for debtors, who can call her instead and answer questions under oath. Shea said nobody \u2014 not the hospital, ARSI, Brehm or the court \u2014 uses the threat of jail to \u201cextract payment.\u201d\n\nStrickland reached Brehm after several days, and the attorney agreed to a new hearing. On Aug. 13, when they met in court, Brehm sat at the front of the room.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re giving you a second chance on that citation; just to try to take care of this without there having to be any sort of bench warrant,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cI want to make sure that we\u2019re all on the same page about the consequences of not coming into court when the order has been issued.\u201d\n\nStrickland nodded.\n\n\u201cAgain, if you set a payment plan and keep it,\u201d Brehm said, \u201cwe won\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d\n\nThe jail in Independence, where many debtors in the county are booked.\n\nIn some courthouses, like Coffeyville\u2019s, collection attorneys are not only invited to decide when warrants are issued, but they can also shape how law is applied. Recently, Hassenplug came to believe that debtors were only attending every other hearing in a scheme to avoid jail, and he raised his concern with the judge. He suggested that the judge could fix this by charging extra legal fees; Casement wrote a new policy explaining that anyone who missed two debtor\u2019s exam hearings without a good reason would be ordered to pay an extra $50 to cover the plaintiff\u2019s attorney fees. If they didn\u2019t pay, they would be given a two-day jail sentence; for each additional hearing that they missed, they would be charged a higher attorney fee and get a longer sentence.\n\nMost states don\u2019t allow contempt charges to be used for nonpayment, and some, like Indiana and Florida, have concluded that it is unconstitutional. Michael Crowell, a retired law professor at the University of North Carolina and an expert in judicial authority, reviewed Casement\u2019s policy. \u201cYou can\u2019t lock people up for contempt for failing to pay unless you have gone to the trouble to determine that they really have the ability to pay,\u201d he said. Casement told me he hadn\u2019t made findings on ability to pay before ordering defendants to foot attorney\u2019s fees, \u201cbut I know that\u2019s something the court should consider,\u201d he said. He also made plain why he wrote the policy: \u201cMr. Hassenplug and Brehm\u2019s outfit have asked me to.\u201d (Brehm denied she requested this.)\n\nJudge David Casement in the courtroom. Casement, a cattle rancher, was appointed magistrate judge, though he\u2019d never taken a course in law.\n\nCasement has not done everything the debt collection lawyers have suggested. At first, he agreed to their requests to set bail at the amount of the debt, but he eventually settled on $500. \u201cMost people can come up with $500,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may not be their money, but they know someone who will pay.\u201d He made sure no one was arrested unless they\u2019d been reached by personal service or certified mail.\n\nKansas law allows courts to order debtors in \u201cfrom time to time,\u201d leaving discretion to judges. Casement limited the frequency of Hassenplug\u2019s debtor\u2019s exams to once every three months. He came to the decision by his own logic around what seemed like a reasonable burden for defendants, and it remains his personal policy today. The law also states that anyone found to be disabled and unable to pay can only be ordered to appear once a year. Without an attorney, debtors like Kenneth Maggard don\u2019t know to assert this right.\n\nAllowing bail money to count toward collections raises some of the most critical legal questions. Hassenplug told me that he thinks it\u2019s great that cash bail is applied to the debt. \u201cA lot of times, that\u2019s the only time we get paid, is if they go to jail,\u201d he said. Peter Holland, the former director of the Consumer Protection Clinic at the University of Maryland Law School, explained that this practice reveals that the jailing is not about contempt, but about collection. \u201cMost judges will tell you, \u2018I\u2019m working for the rule of law, and if you don\u2019t show up and you were summoned, there have to be consequences,\u2019\u201d he explained. \u201cBut the proof is in the pudding: If the judge is upholding the rule of law, he would give the bail money back to you when you appear in court. Instead, he is using his power to take money from you and hand it to the debt collector. It raises constitutional questions.\u201d\n\nCongress has not acted on advocates\u2019 calls to amend the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act to prohibit collectors from requesting warrants. There are also no current efforts to bar nonprofit hospitals or medical providers that receive funds through Medicare or Medicaid from seeking warrants. Some states have reformed their laws, to make sure defendants are properly served or to prohibit wage garnishments for debt. But legal experts on collections say that more remains to be done, like taking jail out of the equation and instead requiring debtors to sign a financial affidavit or a promise to appear.\n\nMichael Hassenplug\u2019s office in Coffeyville.\n\nShea, from ARSI, said that using the legal process is time-consuming and costly \u2014 a last resort; arrests are \u201cthe least desirable stage for any case to reach for all involved.\u201d Even after lawsuits are filed, they try to connect eligible debtors with the Coffeyville hospital to apply for financial assistance, he said. Last year, the hospital wrote off $1.7 million in charity care, said Bell, the hospital lawyer. \u201cThat is evidence of a hospital that cares.\u201d\n\nCasement said he did not consider the legality of his policies a problem. He placed some blame on the health care system. \u201cWhat we have isn\u2019t working,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a lifelong Republican, I would probably be hung, but I think we need health care for everybody with some limits on what it\u2019s going to cost us.\u201d\n\nThe way he saw it, he had wide latitude to enforce compliance with a court order, though he acknowledged that creditors used bail money to their advantage. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether the Legislature intended it to be used that way or not,\u201d he told me. \u201cI have not had enough pushback from the defendants\u2019 side to give me the impression that I\u2019m really abusing this badly.\u201d\n\nCar lights streak by on a quiet Coffeyville street.\n\nBefore I left Coffeyville, I sat down with Hassenplug in the low-ceilinged courtroom. I asked him whether he thought that the system in Coffeyville was effectively imprisonment for debt, in a country that has outlawed debtors\u2019 prisons. \u201cThe only thing they\u2019re in jail for is not appearing,\u201d he replied. \u201cI do my job, I follow the law. You just have to show up in court.\u201d\n\nDebt collection is an $11 billion industry, involving nearly 8,000 firms across the country. Medical debt makes up almost half of what\u2019s collected each year. Today, millions of debt collection suits are overwhelming state courts. The practice is considered a \u201crace of the diligent,\u201d where every creditor is rushing to the courthouse, hustling to get the first judgment, in order to be the first to collect on a debtor\u2019s assets. In Hassenplug\u2019s view, though, this work is not the rich taking from the poor. He laughed at how locals spread rumors, saying that he seized wheelchairs or Christmas trees. Once, he confessed, he took a man\u2019s Rolex, only to find out it was a fake. Some months, he said, even his law office could not make ends meet.\n\nAfter a couple of hours, a clerk poked her head into the courtroom and told us it was time to leave. Hassenplug and I began to walk out, and on the terrazzo steps, he asked if I wanted to see his buildings. He owned five of them on a shuttered stretch of town. He wondered out loud if he was making a mistake by inviting me, but he was pleased when I accepted. \u201cThere ain\u2019t any place on earth quieter than downtown Coffeyville,\u201d he said, leading me into the silent streets.\n\nHe walked me through the alleys under a cloudless sky, and when he arrived at one of his buildings, he tapped a code to his garage. The door lifted, and inside, five perfectly maintained motorcycles, Yamahas and Suzukis, were propped in a line. To their left, nine pristine, candy-colored cars were arranged \u2013 a Camaro SS with orange stripes, a Pontiac Trans Am, a vintage Silverado pickup with velvet seats. He toured me around the show cars, peering into their windows, and mused about what his hard work had gotten him.\n\nCorrection, Oct. 16, 2019: This story originally misstated the type of cancer Tres Biggs\u2019 son, Lane, had.
