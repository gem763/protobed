(9984.T) has prepared a financing package for WeWork Companies Inc that would give it control over the shared office space company, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: SoftBank Corp. placard is prepared during a ceremony to mark the company's debut on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in Tokyo, Japan December 19, 2018. REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo\n\nThe package would significantly increase the stake of SoftBank, which already owns around one third of WeWork, and further dilute the influence of co-founder Adam Neumann, said the person, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nReuters had reported that SoftBank was in negotiations to make a $1 billion investment to enable WeWork to go through a major restructuring.\n\nWithout a fresh infusion of cash, WeWork risks running out of money as early as the end of the December, the person said.\n\nWeWork is working with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to negotiate a $3 billion debt deal after a planned initial public offering was tabled last month because of investor concerns about how it was valued and its business model, Reuters reported last week.\n\n\u201cWeWork has retained a major Wall Street financial institution to arrange a financing,\u201d a WeWork spokeswoman said. \u201cApproximately 60 financing sources have signed confidentiality agreements and are meeting with the company\u2019s management and its bankers over the course of this past week and this coming week.\u201d\n\nWeWork lost $1.9 billion in 2018 and burned through $2.36 billion in cash in the first half of this year, according to filings.\n\nIn recent weeks, global credit rating agencies Standard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch Ratings have also downgraded WeWork\u2019s credit ratings deeper into junk territory, while the company\u2019s junk bond is trading at a record low.\n\nWeWork last month replaced co-founder Neumann as CEO with insiders Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham taking on joint CEO roles.\n\nThe pair have talked about the need to return to WeWork\u2019s core business of renting out trendy office space to freelancers and enterprises. That would pull the company back from the fringe activities Neumann had forayed into, such as a school, apartment buildings and various businesses.", "description": "SoftBank Group Corp. <9984.T> has prepared a financing package for WeWork Companies Inc that would give it control over the shared office space company, a person familiar with the matter said.", "authors": ["Joshua Franklin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440508175&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0Q6", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
