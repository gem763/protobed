Guiffre claims Dershowitz \"was also a participant in sex trafficking, including as one of the men to whom Epstein lent out Plaintiff for sex,\" and that Dershowitz falsely claimed she had fabricated the accusations.\n\nDershowitz has adamantly denied the allegations and filed motions to dismiss the case and to disqualify Giuffre's lawyers from representing her. He claims that she conspired with her lawyers at the firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP to extort him.\n\nBut Judge Loretta Preska ruled Wednesday that the case would continue, stating that \"Giuffre has pled sufficient facts\" to defeat Dershowitz's motion to dismiss. Preska ruled in Dershowitz's favor on a second motion he filed \u2014 that Giuffre could no longer be represented by lawyers from Boies Schiller Flexner LLP due to the likelihood that lawyers from the firm will be called as witnesses in the case.\n\nThe case hinges in part on Giuffre's claim that Dershowitz defamed her by saying she and lawyers at Boies Schiller Flexner attempted to extort him.\n\n\"The defamation case against Alan Dershowitz is going forward and he will have to face justice,\" Sigrid McCawley, one of Giuffre's lawyers at Boies Schiller Flexner, said. \"The decision, however, to disqualify our firm, which has had the privilege of representing Virginia and advocating for her brave voice and continued call for justice, is deeply disappointing and it will be promptly appealed.\"\n\nDershowitz released a statement saying he was pleased that the firm led by prominent attorney David Boies has been \"disqualified.\" He said he plans to call Boies \"as a major witness to prove \u2014 in Boies' own recorded words \u2014 that his client is 'wrong ... simply wrong' in accusing me.\"\n\nAccording to the judge's ruling, Dershowitz also provided the court transcripts of a conversation between himself and Boies.\n\nThe judge cited the transcript in her ruling saying that if Giuffre's current attorneys weren't disqualified, they would be in the unusual position of having to question their own colleagues, including Boies, about conflicting evidence and testimony in the case.\n\nThe case is now headed to trial, though Giuffre will need new representation. Dershowitz told the court his legal team plans to call multiple lawyers from Boies Schiller Flexner as witnesses to prove the extortion happened. Giuffre's attorneys at the firm maintain that the conversation transcript was taken out of context and that nothing improper occurred.\n\nGiuffre, who lives in Australia, could not immediately be reached for comment.", "description": "Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre filed a defamation case against Dershowitz in April, saying he falsely claimed she fabricated her accusations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4238780/1000x563_nbc-191016-alan-dershowitz-mn-1510_ad50f887cfcf3b1c1167a29834d00bf0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
