These include department store giant Myer, chicken giant Inghams Group and, perhaps most notoriously, retailer Dick Smith, which collapsed in 2016.\n\n\"I think people are realising that private equity are selling for a good reason \u2013 and they are often selling before a company becomes ex-growth,\" Mr Radzyminski said.\n\nLatitude chairman Mike Tilley said on Wednesday morning the board and shareholders had determined not to proceed with the offer given they were \"conscious of the importance of ensuring a strong after market for the company\".\n\nRetail sentiment about the float was turning sour last week.\n\nMorningstar analyst Nathan Zaia released a report warning clients against subscribing for shares, citing questions of the credit quality of its personal loans, payments, instalment, credit card and buy now, pay later receivables.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntelligent Investor described the deal as the \u201cmost unappealing large IPOs we have ever seen.\u201d\n\nPotential investors were also struggling to assess how Latitude might perform in a downturn, because the prospectus only contained limited historical data.\n\n\"There are reasons to be cautious when PE [private equity] is selling, and we didn\u2019t like the lack of historical information in the prospectus,\" Mr Zaia said on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"The company has been around a very long time but there were only a couple of years of data on receivables and a lack of profit or cash flow info going back a number of years. This seemed very selective on what information they wanted to give yet there was data overload in the document too.\n\n\"This makes you ask what type of profit through global financial crisis does this make. why not have that data - it probably does not look good.\"\n\nAs Latitude met professional investors in recent weeks, there were concerns its high-interest lending to customers at the point of sale could come into focus as regulators try to lift the bar on lending standards. It's insurance business was also cited as a potential focus.\n\nIt remains unclear, on Wednesday morning, whether the private equity vendors pulled the deal. It was initially priced at $2.25, then firmed at $2, and then this week was reduced to $1.78. Meanwhile, a lack of retail support soured sentiment about its likely performance in the aftermarket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStreet Talk reported concerns about the quality of the institutional register following book-building efforts, suggesting the company may have failed to attract high quality, long-term investors. That could have put more downward pressure on the value of the equity the PE vendors were set to retain and hold on escrow.\n\n\"I honestly thought it was disappointing..it's a big raise, it's a lot of money to take out of the market, unless you get a few big cornerstone it probably won't happen,\" Mr King said.\n\nThe float has been pulled despite some sentiment in the market its pricing was appropriate. Mr King said he believes Latitude - which at $1.78, would have been priced at around 11-times earnings - would have been a good performer given major banks are withdrawing from personal lending and the opportunity in the buy now, pay later sector, into which Latitude was planning to expand.\n\n\"They [Latitude] should win market share from the banks...I think they are in a very good position to win market share from Afterpay and Zip. I like the the business and I think Ahmed [Fahour] will do a great job as CEO,\" Mr King said.\n\nAnother fund manager pointed to low quality earnings disclosed in the prospectus, including some capitalised costs being included in the earnings which made them look stronger than they were.\n\nAnother potential investor said that while it was common for private equity vendors to pay a CEO a bonus to get a company listed, Mr Fahour's rewards seemed rich. On top of a potential total annual salary of $4.84 million and shares worth around $28 million purchased using an interest-free loan from the company of $17.5 million plus his own funds, he was set to earn a bonus of $22.5 million if the company listed.\n\n\"I don\u2019t like this structure, I don\u2019t think right way to go about it,\" the fund manager said.\n\nIn a media statement, Mr Fahour said: \"While it is disappointing that we are not in a position to progress a public listing at this stage, we will continue to execute on the growth strategy with the support of our shareholder group.\"\n\nMr Tilley said: \"Latitude is a strong business and its management team will continue to execute on the growth strategy embodied by Latitude 2.0.\u201d", "description": "Latitude chief Ahmed Fahour has emailed staff telling them its float will not proceed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.5155%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1410%2C$y_156/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/517757f28a3a6d9037d9b4f3d509b1c7e29d0b74", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
