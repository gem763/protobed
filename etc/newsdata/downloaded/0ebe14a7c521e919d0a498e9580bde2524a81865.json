Three decades after the heavy metal singer\u2019s last top 10 hit, Osbourne is back on the charts at No. 8 with \u201cTake What You Want,\u201d a collaboration with hip-hop stars Post Malone and Travis Scott.\n\n\u201cTake\u201d marks the longest time between top 10s in Billboard chart history. Osbourne\u2019s prior hit occurred in 1989 on a duet with Lita Ford (\u201cClose My Eyes Forever\u201d).\n\nIf you\u2019re not up on current music: Post Malone\u2019s real name is Austin Post; born in Syracuse, the heavily tattooed singer has dabbled in hip-hop, rock and pop, and earned his initial fame as an opener for Justin Bieber in 2016. Unnamed InsideHook editors would describe him as \u201csomething like Everlast for 2019\u201d while admitting \u201che\u2019s got bangers.\u201d\n\nPost actually has four songs in the top 10, a feat more easily accomplished in an era when individual song streaming on services like Spotify determines chart placement far more than sales or radio play (\u201cWant\u201d had 35.7 million streams during the chart\u2019s tracking week).\n\nAnd if you\u2019re not up on older music: Apparently, a lot of Post Malone fans were not aware of Ozzy Osbourne.\n\nWhatever you think of the rap-rock banger, the collaboration was apparently uplifting. In an interview with The Sun (via the metal site Blabbermouth), Osbourne, 70, noted that Post Malone reached out while the former Black Sabbath frontman was recovering from pneumonia. \u201cI\u2019d never even heard of the kid,\u201d he said, but he liked the end result so much, he ended up recording a new nine-song record with PM\u2019s producer Andrew Watt, which should be released in the next few months.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: RealClearLife, a news and lifestyle publisher, is now a part of InsideHook.
