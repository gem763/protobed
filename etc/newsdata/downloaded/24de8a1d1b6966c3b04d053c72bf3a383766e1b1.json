There's a reason. This isn't General Motors of yore.\n\nAuto technician, Mitch Lickteig works on the lifters of a 2015 GMC Sierra truck at the Landers Buick GMC in Southaven, MS Saturday, Oct. 11, 2019. More\n\n75,000 non-GM workers hit by strike\n\nOnce the largest corporation on the planet with more than 600,000 workers worldwide and more than 100 major factories in the United States, GM has been pared down to 33 U.S. plants. Rather than make the bulk of the components fashioned into a vehicle, GM has followed rivals such as Chrysler, Nissan and Toyota and now buys a large share of auto parts from independent suppliers.\n\nThat has lessened the impact of a strike on motorists taking their car to the service center for repairs. Independent plants making items such as filters and valves didn't send all the workers on the shop floor home when GM closed down. As a result, the pipeline of parts flowing into dealers such as Cadillac of Knoxville in Tennessee is less full, Clark said, but hasn't had time to empty out since the strike began.\n\nHow we ditched debt: Little splurges on the path to freedom\n\nWhat should you do?: You'll only get a small increase in Social Security benefits in 2020\n\nUnited Auto Workers union leaders in Detroit ordered the walkout against GM after the four-year labor contract expired, putting about 48,000 UAW members on strike beginning Sept. 16.\n\nLate Friday night, UAW made a proposal to GM executives it said, if accepted, would constitute a \u201ctentative agreement,\u201d according to a letter posted to the UAW website.\n\nThe sides are divided over health care costs, use of temporary workers, production in Mexico, pension issues, wage gains, the decision to close four U.S. car assembly plants and lower anticipated employment levels in plants making future electric cars.\n\nWhen GM production ceased, hundreds of independent factories slowed down and reassigned workers to maintenance tasks. As the strike went on, these independent suppliers gradually laid off workers:\n\nUAW Local 1853 President Tim Stannard estimates independent suppliers have idled about 2,500 autoworkers in Middle Tennessee factories that make parts used in engines and vehicles assembled at GM's complex outside Nashville at Spring Hill, Tennessee.\n\nIn Tennessee, GM employs about 5,000 workers at Spring Hill, including about 1,400 independent contractors, and nearly 200 workers at the Memphis distribution center. Most of these 5,200 workers are now idle.\n\nThroughout the nation, independent factories have laid off or reduced wages for 75,000 autoworkers, estimated Anderson Economic Group of East Lansing, Michigan.\n\nService techs pinched first\n\nAuto dealers had a substantial amount of new vehicles on car lots when the strike began and many have been continuously resupplied new autos that were in storage awaiting delivery. That leaves the service center as the first place on the car lot to feel the early pinch of idled assembly plants.\n\n\"We're already seeing the effects of the strike, but it's mostly in parts,\" said Brett Gilmore, general manager of Beaman Buick GMC in Nashville, adding \"we're not being hit quite as hard as the others.\"\n\nBeaman's parts warehouse, said to be the largest GM parts inventory of any dealer in the Southeastern U.S., has supplied the dealer's service technicians with necessary items, Gilmore said.\n\nIn Knoxville, Clark's dealership regularly phones other dealers, including dealers in neighboring cities, to locate a needed part or swap items. No consumer has missed repairs or maintenance. So far the shortage is just that, a shortage rather than a complete absence of necessary products, Clark said.\n\nStory continues", "description": "As the UAW-GM strike stretches into week five, the parts pipeline\u00a0reaching from factories to service techs fixing GM brands\u00a0hasn't gone dry - yet.", "authors": ["Ted Evanoff", "Memphis Commercial Appeal"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4MMj2gPqjnBbrMtrqjXs6g--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTEwODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_money_325/c899f6e871b4af370fca8ee71086a368", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
