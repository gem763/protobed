As a parent of two teenage girls, McCulloch thinks the #MeToo movement has been a hugely positive influence: \u201cIt\u2019s given girls and young women more of a voice.\u201d\n\nHowever, another mother, whose teenage daughter was raped by a classmate, disagreed. \u201cMy view is that the #MeToo movement hasn\u2019t really helped in schools, as those affected there are still so young. They don\u2019t yet have the confidence to call it out.\u201d\n\nAndrea Simon from the End Violence Against Women campaign said: \u201cThe #MeToo movement exposed the scale and seriousness of sexual violence and harassment, and whilst we want women and girls to feel confident to report what has happened to them, we must see authorities doing more to respond appropriately and focus on prevention.\u201d\n\nIn UK universities, the problem of sexual misconduct by students and staff towards students has been well documented in recent years. Many institutions have introduced consent workshops and improved staff training to try to address the problem, but campaigners say it is not enough.\n\n\u201cIn practice, there has been little change in the higher education sector in the UK in terms of institutional accountability for sexual- and gender-based violence since #MeToo, and institutions have been slow to implement preventive solutions,\u201d said Dr Tiffany Page, a lecturer at Cambridge University and co-founder of the 1752 group, which campaigns to end sexual misconduct in higher education.\n\nAlison Phipps, a professor of gender studies at the University of Sussex, said: \u201cI think some very brave survivors have come forward and we have had some very high-profile \u2018scalps\u2019, but genuine change in the sector will take a long time.\u201d However, she welcomed the way in which #MeToo has brought survivors together.\n\nIn the NHS there has also been insufficient progress. A recent survey found one in five doctors had been sexually harassed in the last three years or had witnessed sexual harassment at work, including groping, touching and explicit text messages. The perpetrators were mostly patients (17%), according to the Medscape online survey of just under 1,400 hospital doctors and GPs. Just 3% of cases involved fellow medics or nurses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go,\u201d said Dr Julia Patterson, who coordinates EveryDoctor, a 25,000-strong campaigning forum for doctors. She said #MeToo had enabled conversations about the gender pay gap and equality of opportunity for male and female doctors. \u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting subject in the NHS. Until maybe a couple of years ago, around the #MeToo time, it was not spoken about very much,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201c[#MeToo] has brought the conversation so far. Women are perhaps feeling more empowered to speak up, and to speak to other people, but not enough has been done practically.\u201d\n\nThe impact of #MeToo has also been felt in the police, though Michelle Skeer, the chief constable of Cumbria police and president of the British Association for Women in Policing, defended her force\u2019s record on dealing with sexual harassment and gender equality. She added: \u201cThe #MeToo movement has brought about positive change for women in many areas of society.\n\n\u201cThe movement has acted as a catalyst to get conversations going around sexual harassment in life, as well as in the workplace, providing a platform and the confidence for numerous women to share their experiences. Our stance on sexual harassment remains clear, that it is never acceptable. It is vital to keep conversations going to raise awareness and encourage reporting.\u201d", "description": "Schools, universities and others in public sector urged to do more to fight sexual harassment", "authors": ["Sally Weale", "Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cdee10cb449de0266939dfce0ce7f2cd94c1f3e/0_62_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ff9d358ff5076a22d31e45ee0d7b9ede", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
