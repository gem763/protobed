I'm Angry.'", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.), who announced her resignation from Congress on Sunday amid accusations of sexual relationships with staffers, is speaking out about her decision, vowing to fight back against \u201crevenge porn\u201d after nude photos of her were leaked to conservative media.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hurt. I\u2019m angry,\u201d Hill said in a taped statement released Monday. \u201cThe path that I saw so clearly for myself is no longer there. I\u2019ve had moments where I\u2019ve wondered what the last three years of my life were for, and if it was worth it.\u201d\n\nDays before the freshman congresswoman announced she would step down, a House Ethics Committee probe was launched into unproven allegations that she violated the chamber\u2019s rules by having an affair with her legislative director \u2015 a claim she had denied.\n\nHill has, however, admitted to having had an \u201cinappropriate\u201d relationship with a campaign employee while running for Congress. She has also apologized.\n\n\u201cI never claim to be perfect,\u201d she said in her latest statement. \u201cBut I never thought that my imperfections would be weaponized and used to try to destroy me and the community that I have loved for my entire life. For that, I am so incredibly sorry.\u201d\n\nLast week, intimate photos of Hill were published by right-wing blog RedState and the Daily Mail. The congresswoman, who is facing a contentious divorce, blamed political operatives and her husband.\n\nHill described the spread of the images as a \u201ccoordinated campaign\u201d by her adversaries, slamming it as \u201cdisgusting and unforgivable\u201d and warning that the perpetrators \u201cwill be held accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will fight to ensure that no one else has to live through what I just experienced,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people call this electronic assault, digital exploitation, others call it revenge porn. As the victim of it, I call it one of the worst things that we can do to our sisters and our daughters.\u201d\n\nHill has not specified the date on which she will formally resign, though those familiar with the matter told Politico she might vacate her seat as soon as Nov. 1.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has since addressed Hill\u2019s resignation as the right move, stating, \u201cShe has acknowledged errors in judgment that made her continued service as a Member untenable.\u201d\n\nEnding her recent remarks with a message of resilience, Hill vowed that she would \u201cnot allow my experience to scare off other young women or girls from running for office.\u201d\n\n\u201cI grew up riding horses, and the most important thing that I learned was that when you fall off, you have to get right back up in the saddle,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to do that.\u201d", "description": "The congresswoman addressed her decision to step down amid allegations of sexual relationships with staffers and the leak of nude photos.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db72a9f210000df2c34b46f.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
