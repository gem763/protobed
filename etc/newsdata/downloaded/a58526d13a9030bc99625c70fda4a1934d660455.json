The suspect, 27-year-old German Stephan Balliet, filmed the assault and streamed it online.\n\nThe victims, reportedly a German man and woman, appeared to be chosen at random when the assailant failed to gain access to the temple he had besieged with gunfire and homemade explosives, as the frightened congregation barricaded itself inside.\n\nThe rampage was streamed live for 35 minutes on Twitch, and eventually seen by some 2,200 people, the online platform said, in a chilling reminder of the mosque attack in Christchurch, New Zealand in March which was also played out online in real-time.\n\nPolice subsequently captured the Halle suspect after a gun battle that left him wounded.\n\nMerkel told a trade union convention that the German state and civil society must do everything in their power to stand up to \u201chate, violence and contempt for human life\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere must be zero tolerance,\u201d she said.\n\nLate Wednesday, Merkel joined a solidarity vigil at a historic Berlin synagogue, and firmly condemned the anti-Semitic rampage.\n\nPresident Frank-Walter Steinmeier, joined by Israeli ambassador Jeremy Issacharoff and local officials, laid flowers Thursday at the Halle temple before meeting Jewish community representatives inside.\n\nHe later told reporters that the country had a duty to protect Jews on its soil, also in light of its historical guilt for the Holocaust.\n\n\u201cIt must be clear that the state takes responsibility for Jewish life, for the security of Jewish life in Germany,\u201d he said.\n\nFederal prosecutor Peter Frank said Balliet would be charged with two counts of murder and nine counts of attempted murder in what he called a \u201cterror\u201d act that had been planned to be a \u201cmassacre\u201d.\n\nBalliet had packed four kilogrammes (nine pounds) of explosives in his car, and \u201cwanted to enter the synagogue to kill many people,\u201d added Frank.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Action not words\u2019 \u2013\n\nBut Jewish leaders said that words were not enough, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joining calls for Germany to \u201cact resolutely\u201d against anti-Semitism.\n\nThe head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany ripped into the authorities for failing to provide adequate security on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar.\n\n\u201cIt is scandalous that the synagogue in Halle is not protected by police on a holiday like Yom Kippur,\u201d said Josef Schuster.\n\n\u201cThis negligence has now been bitterly repaid.\u201d\n\nGermany has taken pride in the rebirth of Jewish life since the Nazis\u2019 World War II slaughter of six million Jews across Europe.\n\nThe community has grown to about 225,000 thanks in large part to an influx from the ex-Soviet Union after the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\nWithout mentioning the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) by name, Merkel and Steinmeier condemned xenophobic rhetoric they said had grown increasingly mainstream and dangerous.\n\nAfD parliamentary group leader Alice Weidel pushed back, saying critics were \u201cexploiting this horrible crime to defame their political rivals with baseless defamation\u201d.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Saw through the camera\u2019 \u2013\n\nIn a copy of a 35-minute video obtained by AFP the gunman filmed himself launching into a diatribe against women and Jews and denying the Holocaust, before carrying out the attack.\n\nThe gunman also published an anti-Semitic \u201cmanifesto\u201d online more than a week ago, according to SITE monitoring group director Rita Katz, who said the document showed pictures of the weapons and ammunition he used.\n\nHalle Jewish community leader Max Privorotzki told the Stuttgarter Zeitung of the harrowing minutes as the synagogue came under assault with 70 to 80 people inside.\n\n\u201cWe barricaded our doors from inside and waited for the police,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we carried on with our service.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Failure\u2019, \u2018loser\u2019 \u2013\n\nAmong those in the synagogue were 10 Americans, as well as several Israelis, who had turned up in Halle especially to join the small local population in celebrating Yom Kippur.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made it out with our lives, in health and amazing spirits,\u201d wrote Rebecca Blady, a Jewish American community leader, who was in the synagogue.\n\nBild daily spoke to relatives and neighbours who described Balliet, a former soldier, as a loner and computer junkie who lived with his mother. In the streamed video he repeatedly calls himself a \u201cfailure\u201d and a \u201closer\u201d.\n\nWednesday\u2019s shootings came three months after the assassination-style murder of local pro-migrant politician Walter Luebcke in the western city of Kassel, allegedly by a known neo-Nazi.\n\nLuebcke\u2019s killing has deeply shaken Germany, raising questions about whether it has failed to take seriously a rising threat from right-wing extremists.", "description": "Halle (Saale) (Germany) (AFP) \u2013 Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed Thursday there would be \u201czero tolerance\u201d for hate in Germany after an", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/8ce67b_victims-apparently-chosen-random-assailant-failed-gain-access-temple-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
