How was he allowed to leave Stamford Bridge?\n\nLampard blamed the sheer weight of competition and that is something \u00a358million signing Christian Pulisic is coming to terms with at Stamford Bridge, but the cases of Salah and Kevin De Bruyne provide lessons from which the Chelsea head coach and the American can learn.\n\nHaving been a team-mate of both players, Lampard will be acutely aware that the Blues cannot make the same mistake for a third time by getting to the stage where 21-year-old Pulisic is not given the time or patience at Stamford Bridge that he might be afforded to flourish elsewhere.\n\nLampard is proving himself to be a shrewd operator, as proven by his trust in Chelsea\u2019s Academy graduates, the decision to allow David Luiz to leave and the fact he is getting the best out of Jorginho and Willian - two players who last season became a target of Chelsea\u2019s supporters.\n\nPulisic is currently his biggest problem and yet Lampard\u2019s handling of the winger looks to be the correct approach, as long as he and the player can hold their nerve.\n\nThe great mystery of how Salah never made it at Chelsea has finally been solved by Telegraph Sport and it was Tottenham Hotspur left-back Danny Rose who effectively ended his Blues career before it had properly started.", "description": "Frank Lampard has already faced the question that each new Chelsea coach has been forced to answer since Mohamed Salah joined Liverpool.", "authors": ["Matt Law", "Football News Correspondent", "Alan Tyers", "Luke Edwards"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/07/TELEMMGLPICT000212212264-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq31-nfT0w9qdqglWu63XGbUBjQzTQKPQkR09J4aE-h4Y.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
