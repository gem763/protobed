Many waved billowing Lebanese flags and insisted the protests should remain peaceful and non-sectarian.\n\nThe demonstrators are demanding a sweeping overhaul of Lebanon\u2019s political system, citing grievances ranging from austerity measures to poor infrastructure.\n\nThey have blocked main roads and threatened to topple the country\u2019s fragile coalition government.\n\nMost Lebanese politicians have uncharacteristically admitted the demonstrations are spontaneous, rather than blaming outside influences.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah trade cross-border fire for first time in years Read more\n\nDemonstrators in Beirut celebrated the news of the coalition party\u2019s resignation, calling on other blocs to leave the government.
