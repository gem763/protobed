Every innovation has a cost, but when the benefits exceed the costs the innovation creates long-term economic prosperity.\n\nWhy Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty (first published in 2012 and written by Armenian-American economist Daron Acemoglu and British political scientist James Robinson) shows that countries that grow wealth per capita at a high rate over time (in the process reducing unemployment and creating a stable democracy) are the winners.\n\nThe key factor is that they don\u2019t allow rentiers (strong interest groups) to prevent change.\n\nBelow are two examples of the long-term impact of innovative changes that came with a price, but over time enabled industries to evolve and become more consumer-centric, competitive and therefore sustainable.\n\nExample one: the car displaced the entire horse buggy industry over 13 years\n\nThe horse buggy industry was a vast and thriving industry employing thousands of workers and artisans across the US. It generated good returns for horse farmers and for those providing the capital for the service stations that offered cart making and repairs, horse feeding, and food and accommodation for travelers. But between 1900 and 1913 the motor car displaced the entire horse buggy industry. The capital invested was written off and all the jobs were lost as the specialist artisan skills became redundant. However, the motor car not only created new horizons (faster and further travel) but created many more jobs than had been lost.", "description": "Advancements in fintech has caused fear of job losses for thousands of workers in South African banking.
