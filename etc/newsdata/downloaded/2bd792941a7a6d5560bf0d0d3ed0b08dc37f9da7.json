It's not sure whether his team are playing Counter-Strike or PUBG, although with stunts like this it usually doesn't matter. I'm low key hoping it's really PUBG and everyone has proximity voice enabled, so everyone just starts screaming \"What About Me\" through the mic as they close in.\n\nA member from FaZe Clan, Hazz, will be training the team, although five bucks says he ends up just joining and carrying them for the rest of the tournament.\n\nThe author's accommodation throughout Melbourne International Games Week and PAX Australia was provided courtesy of Airbnb for Work.", "description": "The Shannon Noll meme has been quiet for a little while so ... why not bring it back with an esports team?", "authors": ["Luke Plunkett", "Alex Walker"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/k/2019/10/shannon-noll-esports-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
