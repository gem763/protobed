Somerset, needing to win to overtake Specsavers County Championship leaders Essex and claim the pennant for the first time, were 144 for nine when Leach came to the wicket after lunch.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe prize of a potentially precious batting point was 56 runs away and a distant prospect for Somerset.\n\nBut, 30 days on from those Headingley heroics when Leach made an unbeaten one and held his nerve for Ben Stokes to mastermind a famous Ashes Test victory, the bespectacled tail-ender again provided crucial last-man support. This time Leach made an unbeaten 11 from 36 balls as Roelof Van Der Merwe played the role of Stokes with a hard-hitting 60.\n\nVan Der Merwe made a mockery of his lowly No10 spot as he smashed three fours and four sixes before becoming Aron Nijjar's first victim in red-ball cricket this summer.\n\nThe efforts of Van Der Merwe and Leach took Somerset to a first-innings total of 203 on a surface offering assistance to seamers and spinners alike.\n\nEssex had reached 25 without loss before the rain returned to prevent any action after tea.\n\nSam Cook pins Lewis Gregory leg-before Credit: Harry Trump/Getty Images\n\nHeavy overnight rain had delayed play until 12pm and Somerset, resuming on 75 for four, were soon in trouble as a strong breeze blew across the County Ground. George Bartlett turned Simon Harmer, who would later complete his 10th five-wicket championship haul of the summer, to Ravi Bopara at leg-slip in the off-spinner's first over.\n\nStory continues\n\nLewis Gregory adopted a positive approach the day after being called up for England T20 duty in New Zealand this winter. Gregory struck four boundaries in one Harmer over, but fell for 17 when he offered no shot to Sam Cook and was trapped lbw.\n\nSomerset skipper Tom Abell, as he had done on day one, defended the good ball and punished the bad one and found diligent support in Dominic Bess.\n\nThe pair saw Somerset through to lunch, but Abell's 132-ball stay was ended straight after the break when he played back to Harmer and was pinned lbw.\n\nCraig Overton went in identical fashion two balls later and Bess departed for 10 when Cook nipped one back to uproot his middle stump.\n\nThat was the signal for Van Der Merwe to go on the attack, sweeping Harmer for six and striking the South African for another maximum with an audacious reverse sweep.\n\nWith Leach unflustered at the other end, the Somerset pair delighted a healthy home crowd by claiming a batting point before Van Der Merwe was castled by Nijjar.\n\nHarmer finished with five for 105 from his 27 overs, while the economical Cook returned the remarkable figures of 19-9-26-4.\n\nEssex were fortunate to escape injury with the bat as Gregory and Overton produced fine new-ball spells to beat opening pair Nick Browne and Sir Alastair Cook several times.\n\nThe floodlights were switched on as the skies darkened and Somerset turned to their England spinners, Bess and Leach, who bowled an over each before the rain returned and play was abandoned for the day at 4.50pm. Press Association\n\n4:54PM\n\nPlay abandoned for the day\n\nAnd stumps drawn. Essex trail Somerset by 178 runs with all 10 first-innings wickets remaining.\n\n4:39PM\n\nRain update\n\nThanks, Jake. I'm afraid the prospects of any further play are vanishingly slender. It's absolutely siling it down in Zummerzet.\n\n3:55PM\n\nThe rain has started\n\nThe covers are now fully across the square at Taunton as the rain starts to fall. The sky looks very grey and ominous for the evening session.\n\n3:45PM\n\nTEA: 25/0\n\nEssex will be pleased with the opening 11 overs of their innings. The real test is still to come with Leach and Bess set to continue on this turning pitch after tea. The covers are put on as tea is taken - it is just precautionary but there is a little bit of drizzle in the air.\n\n3:43PM\n\nOVER 11: ESS 25/0 (Browne 16* Cook 5*)\n\nSomerset run around to make sure they get another over in. Dom Bess into the attack. He starts around the wicket to Browne. He'll fancy the two left-handers on this pitch. Good start as one stays low and nearly clips off stump. Browne works the ball through mid-wicket for one. One ball until tea. It finds Cook's inside edge but rolls away safely along the floor.\n\n3:40PM\n\nOVER 10: ESS 24/0 (Browne 15* Cook 5*)\n\nHere we go. Spin enters the innings. Jack Leach given the nod. He starts around the wicket to Browne. Some turn from Leach as ball pops up to short leg off the thigh pad. The next ball turns down the leg side past the keep for two byes. Leach over pitches and Browne pushes a single through mid on. Essex are slowing the game down with tea approaching.\n\n3:35PM\n\nOVER 9: ESS 21/0 (Browne 14* Cook 5*)\n\nGregory continues round the wicket to Cook. Tom Abell must be thinking about bringing on spin soon on this Taunton pitch. Another play and miss. A yorker from Gregory flies to Van der Merwe in the slips - bump ball. Cook then pushes a single through the covers.\n\n3:31PM\n\nOVER 8: ESS 20/0 (Browne 14* Cook 4*)\n\nOverton starts the over very full drawing Cook forwards. Cook squirts the last ball of the other past gully for one. Good from Overton.\n\n3:27PM\n\nOVER 7: ESS 18/0 (Browne 14* Cook 2*)\n\nOne keeps low from Gregory but it is called a no-ball. Browne then nails the ball through extra cover for four. Fantastic shot as Browne gets his hands through the ball fully. Another superb shot from Browne - this time straight back past the bowler. Two boundaries in the over. Gregory changes the angle to no avail.\n\n3:23PM\n\nOVER 6: ESS 8/0 (Browne 6* Cook 2*)\n\nOverton now causing Cook problems. He strikes Cook on the pads but too high once again. The batsman are struggling to read the bounce of this pitch. Cook clips the ball down to fine leg for a single. Browne drives off the back foot for a single.\n\n3:19PM\n\nOVER 5: ESS 6/0 (Browne 5* Cook 1*)\n\nAnother play and miss by Cook against Gregory. Some extra bounce from Gregory as he hits the splice. The ball goes in the air but away from the slip cordon. Cook off the mark. It is Browne's turn to play and miss. Great start from Gregory who is looking very dangerous.\n\n3:16PM\n\nOVER 4: ESS 5/0 (Browne 5* Cook 0*)\n\nOverton continues to be a little short with his lengths. A half appeal for LBW from Overton but the ball was going well over the stumps. Much better from Overton as he gets the ball full and it swings away from the left-handed Browne. Good end to the over from Overton. Maiden.\n\n3:12PM\n\nOVER 3: ESS 5/0 (Browne 5* Cook 0*)\n\nCook faces his first ball of the innings - a yorker from Gregory which is kept out comfortably. Cook clips the ball of his pads but it finds the fielder. Gregory makes Cook play and miss as another ball nips away from the left-hander from round the wicket. And another one. Very good from Gregory.\n\n3:09PM\n\nOVER 2: ESS 5/0 (Browne 5* Cook 0*)\n\nCraig Overton opens the bowling from the other end. He starts a little short and Browne punishes him with a cut shot for four. Overton extracts some bounce and carry from the pitch as one flies through to Steve Davies. The bounce is a little inconsistent. Browne ends the over with a play and miss.\n\n3:06PM\n\nOVER 1: ESS 1/0 (Browne 1* Cook 0*)\n\nGregory has started round the wicket to the left-hander with a very full length at just a touch over 80mph. One flies past the edge as it holds on the pitch and nips away. A full toss is hit to the fielder - it is only half stopped and they scamper a single. A direct hit generates a half appeal but Browne is well in.\n\n3:02PM\n\nEssex Innings begins:\n\nNick Browne will take strike against Lewis Gregory.\n\n3:01PM\n\nRoelof van der Merwe's dismissal\n\nSOMERSET ALL OUT FOR 2\ufe0f\u20e3\ufffd\ufffd\ufe0f3\ufe0f\u20e3\n\n\n\nVan der Merwe (60) is bowled round his legs by Nijar after missing with his attempted reverse sweep \ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd\ufffd Watch #SOMvESS: https://t.co/VTFhJmZMT4 \ufffd\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\ufffd Scorecard: https://t.co/0ioEKCIEUB \ufffd\ufffd@CountyChamp \ufffd\ufffd @SomersetCCC@EssexCricketpic.twitter.com/qSTDcYV6Eb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Sky Sports Cricket (@SkyCricket) September 24, 2019\n\n3:00PM\n\nChange of Innings\n\nNick Browne and Alastair Cook will open the batting for Essex.

Great innings takes Somerset to a decent score of 203 on a turning pitch. Leach is not out again this summer.

He wants the strike.\n\n2:50PM\n\nOVER 60: SOM 201/9 (Van der Merwe 58* Leach 11*)\n\nAnother six from Van der Merwe brings up Somerset's 200. He launches Harmer over mid-wicket. What a knock this has been. New ball required. The South African works a quicker ball from Harmer round the corner for a single. Leach survives two balls at the end of the over.\n\n2:47PM\n\nOVER 59: SOM 194/9 (Van der Merwe 51* Leach 11*)\n\nVan der Merwe nails a six over mid-wicket which brings up his 50 from just 42 balls. He then slaps the next ball through the offside for one. Leach advances down the wicket and tries to launch the ball over mid-wicket. He misses the ball. Leach should stick to his strengths with Van der Merwe going at the other end. Leach sees out the over.\n\nJack Leach is involved in yet another important last-wicket stand... \ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\nHe and Roelof van der Merwe have put on close to 50 as Somerset look to pass 200 in @CountyChamp decider \ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd\ufffd Watch #SOMvESS: https://t.co/VTFhJmZMT4 \ufffd\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\ufffd Scorecard: https://t.co/0ioEKCIEUB \ufffd\ufffd pic.twitter.com/dU0TE6pnjE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Sky Sports Cricket (@SkyCricket) September 24, 2019\n\n2:42PM\n\nOVER 58: SOM 187/9 (Van der Merwe 44* Leach 11*)\n\nHarmer continues. A single is turned down again before one is taken. Partnership now worth 43. Leach is lunging forward to the turning ball. Harmer is varying his pace nicely. The ball bounces up and glances Leach's gloves but falls safe.\n\n2:38PM\n\nOVER 57: SOM 186/9 (Van der Merwe 43* Leach 11*)\n\nAaron Nijar comes into the attack. The left arm spinner starts nicely. Van der Merwe turns down a single off the second ball of the over. He then takes a single off the next ball. Leach defends solidly. The story of his summer...\n\n2:35PM\n\nOVER 57: SOM 185/9 (Van der Merwe 42* Leach 11*)\n\nRuns continue to flow. Van der Merwe plays through the leg side before an edge runs away for another two runs. Van der Merwe sweeps again, this time for a single out to the man on the boundary.\n\n2:32PM\n\nOVER 56: SOM 180/9 (Van der Merwe 37* Leach 11*)\n\nVan der Merwe gets another single of Porter. Leach looks fairly comfortable out there. Porter hits him on the pads again but not real appeal. This partnership is building nicely.\n\n2:28PM\n\nOVER 55: SOM 179/9 (Van der Merwe 36* Leach 11*)\n\nVan der Merwe is going after Harmer. He gets one away for four that spins past Sam Cook in the field. He follows up the boundary with a single.\n\n2:26PM\n\nOVER 54: SOM 163/9 (Van der Merwe 29* Leach 11*)\n\nVan der Merwe takes a single off the first ball of the over. Porter bangs in a bouncer but it is called a no-ball. Leach clips the ball through mid-wicket for two. The shot of a man in-form. The next ball is a good LBW shout but it's turned down. That looked very close.\n\nYes, that was out.\n\nJack Leach was given not out Credit: Sky Sports\n\n2:19PM\n\nOVER 53: SOM 167/9 (Van der Merwe 28* Leach 9*)\n\nVan der Merwe stands and delivers when Harmer, back round the wicket, angles a fuller one across him. The batsman smacks a drive in the air past the bowler for four. Essex go back on the defensive and allow him a single to point. I'm going to hand over to Jake Goodwill, now.\n\n2:17PM\n\nOVER 52: SOM 160/9 (Van der Merwe 21* Leach 9*)\n\nLeach is continuing his dogged and enterprising form with the bat, defending ruggedly and taking the singles on offer. Van der Merwe almost chips a catch to cover but it falls short of the diving Bopara.\n\n2:12PM\n\nOVER 51: SOM 157/9 (Van der Merwe 19* Leach 8*)\n\nWeston-super-mare's John Cleese is watching from the pavilion. And applauds when Van der Merwe reverse sweeps Harmer again for four. The right-hander then steals a single (with the field spread by Ten Doeschate) with a tip and run.

The ball is keeping low but Bess digs a couple out to keep his wicket intact.\n\n1:03PM\n\nLUNCH: SOM 126/6\n\nSomerset have put on 51 for the loss of two wickets in the first hour of day two after rain wiped out the opening half of the morning session. George Bartlett was undone by the savage turn of Simon Harmer, Lewis Gregory fell when diddled by Sam Cook's nip-backer after a skittish innings. But Tom Abell is batting superbly and stands five short of 50, an innings which would have accrued twice as many on a less devilish pitch. The forecast for this afternoon is patchy but there should be pockets of play.\n\n1:00PM\n\nOVER 43: SOM 126/6 (Abell 45* Bess 10*)\n\nInside edge on to the pad from Abell falls short of bat-pad who scoops it on the half volley. Abell uses his feet to harpoon four through cover then lets one that rags miles take him on the thigh pad to run three leg-byes.\n\nThere is both bright sunshine and a rain shower as the players depart for lunch.\n\n12:57PM\n\nOVER 42: SOM 118/6 (Abell 41* Bess 9*)\n\nAbell pinches the strike with a square drive off the final ball after blocking and leaving. Abell is playing judiciously and with bags of skill.\n\n12:54PM\n\nOVER 41: SOM 117/6 (Abell 40* Bess 9*)\n\nAnother big spinning over from Harmer. he must have fingers the size of bananas. Abell drills a drive past the bowler for one after cautiously prodding or blocking three. Bess demonstrates orthodox forward and backward defensives to see out the over. The sun's out.\n\n12:50PM\n\nOVER 40: SOM 116/6 (Abell 39* Bess 9*)\n\nFirst change of the morning - Jamie Porter comes on for Sam Cook. Bess and Abell work singles off their pads. Tight over those two milking opportunities notwithstanding.\n\n12:47PM\n\nOVER 39: SOM 114/6 (Abell 38* Bess 8*)\n\nSimon Harmer has a leg slip and forward short square but it's Alastair Cook at first slip who is the key man from round the wicket. He's had a couple of quarter chances but could not get there. Bess nurdles one round the corner off middle stump.\n\nCredit: Sky Sports\n\n12:42PM\n\nOVER 38: SOM 113/6 (Abell 38* Bess 7*)\n\nVery good from Tom Abell who impressively waits for the bad ball, defending four solidly, then rinses an off-drive off Sam Cook for four when he marginally overpitches. The ball seems to hit a puddle over the rope and they take a moment to rub it dry.\n\n12:38PM\n\nOVER 37: SOM 109/6 (Abell 34* Bess 7*)\n\nMore extravagant turn for Harmer. Bess tickles it round the corner for four, then uses his feet to block. Harmer comes round the wicket, giving the batsman little respite between balls and fizzing them down. He gets one to skid on and take Abell's edge which flies past Cook at slip and shoots down to third man for four. A productive over ends when Abell drills a single through cover.\n\nSam Cook, 'Little Chef', takes the wicket of Somerset's Lewis Gregory Credit: Harry Trump/Getty Images\n\n12:33PM\n\nOVER 36: SOM 99/6 (Abell 29* Bess 2*)\n\nCook, a 'nabob of dob', is bowling beautifully with nibble and menace. Bess plays and misses at one that sears away from his defensive but finds the middle and outside half of his bat, palying with soft hands, top steer one through gully for a single. There are spots of rain on the camera.\n\n12:31PM\n\nOVER 35: SOM 98/6 (Abell 29* Bess 1*)\n\nA single apiece for Abell and Bess off Harmer, both working with the turn into the onside.\n\n12:28PM\n\nOVER 34: SOM 96/6 (Abell 28* Bess 0*)\n\nSome comedy when Gregory is diddled. He bellows his exasperation at being gulled by Sam Cook. Enter Bess, who made 57 and 49 in his two Tests last year, and he leaves a couple and solidly blocks the straighter one.\n\n12:20PM\n\nWicket!\n\nGregory lbw b S Cook 17 Oh dear. A decidedly Gattingesque padding up expecting the outswinger. He comes down the pitch, adjusts too late and is pinned by the inswinger not playing a stroke. FOW 96/6\n\n12:20PM\n\nOVER 33: SOM 96/5 (Abell 28* Gregory 17*)\n\nHuge appeal from Harmer when he strikes Gregory high on the back leg with one that turned square. Too high. The batsman is bamboozled by the arm ball, nicks off and Alastair Cook drops a low chance to his right at slip. The leg trap is kept on its toes with a couple of chunky inside edges, the first falls short of Bopara, the next bisects the two for a single.\n\n12:16PM\n\nOVER 32: SOM 95/5 (Abell 28* Gregory 16*)\n\nAbell is batting 50cm outside his crease, Cook bowls the first bad ball of his spell, tailing into the right-hander's legs. Abell whips him round the corner for four. Cook recovers his previous poise and accuracy to rack up five more dot balls in this miserly and threatening spell.\n\n12:13PM\n\nOVER 31: SOM 91/5 (Abell 24* Gregory 16*)\n\nGregory wants to take an aggressive approach and used his feet at the end of the previous over. Harner sees his coming, drags one down and the all-rounder pulls it square for four. The next ball spits up and is taken by the keeper at hip height. Gregory decides he may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, uses his feet and gets a thick inside edge past the keeper's left hand for four. He nicks the next one too, a little feather that beats Alastair Cook at first slip and Adam Wheater, before scuttling away for four then creams a cover drive for his fourth boundary of the over. Jam and cream from Gregory.\n\n12:09PM\n\nOVER 30: SOM 75/5 (Abell 24* Gregory 0**)\n\nSam Cook barely ever breaches 80mph but he is a handful with his accuracy, particularly on this late September dog of a pitch. A result pitch for Somerset, but a minefield all the same. The sun is breaking through but it's very dark over the Quantocks. Abell defends the first four with an angled bat and leaves the last two in Cook's sixth maiden. He has figures of 10-6-5-2.\n\n12:06PM\n\nOVER 29: SOM 75/5 (Abell 24* Gregory 0**)\n\nVociferous appeal from Essex when Harmer rags one back into Bartlett, it strikes him on the pad and booms up to short leg. A wicket feels imminent. And lo! It comes to pass.\n\n12:03PM\n\nWicket!!\n\nBartlett c Bopara b Harmer 5Harmer is too good. His drift is perfect, the ball is turning and the right-hander tried to defend it in the orthodox manner, leaning forward and closing the gate but the turn is suffucuent to take an inside edge on to the pad and spoon tamely to leg slip. FOW 75/5\n\n12:01PM\n\nOVER 28: SOM 75/4 (Abell 24* Bartlett 5*)\n\nSam Cook finishes his over, one to come, with a ripper that leaves Abell as he props forward.
