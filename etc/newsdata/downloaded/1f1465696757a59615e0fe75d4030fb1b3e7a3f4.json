REUTERS/Brendan Mcdermid\n\nGENEVA (Reuters) - The secondary circuit of the Arak heavy water nuclear reactor will be operational within two weeks, Ali Asghar Zarean, a special assistant to the chief of Iran\u2019s Atomic Energy Organization, was quoted as saying on Sunday by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.\n\nThe starting of the secondary circuit will not violate restrictions placed on Iran\u2019s nuclear program under a landmark 2015 deal with world powers.\n\nLast week, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Tehran will continue to reduce its commitments to the deal, removing curbs on its nuclear program, until European parties to the pact protect Iran\u2019s economy from U.S. penalties.\n\nIran has the capacity to produce up to 25 tonnes of heavy water per year, Zarean said, noting that the Islamic Republic currently produces 20 tonnes of heavy water annually, which is exported to other countries.\n\nHeavy water can be employed in reactors to produce plutonium, a fuel used in nuclear warheads.\n\nDespite having nuclear technology, Iran has never pursued building or using nuclear weapons, which its religion forbids, the country\u2019s highest political authority, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said earlier this month.\n\nIran has responded to U.S. \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d by scaling back commitments to the nuclear deal since May. Britain, France and Germany, all signatories to the pact, have urged Iran to refrain from any concrete act breaching the agreement.\n\nThe reduction of commitments can be reversed, Iranian officials have said, if the remaining parties to the deal uphold their promises.", "description": "The secondary circuit of the Arak heavy water nuclear reactor will be operational within two weeks, Ali Asghar Zarean, a special assistant to the chief of Iran\u2019s Atomic Energy Organization, was quoted as saying on Sunday by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1443028790&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0HR", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
