Former Microsoft executive, entrepreneur and sci-fi writer, he sees a world becoming ever-more connected, overcoming barriers of understanding and distance through technology.\n\nREAD: #FutureProofAfrica: Putting humanity back into exponential technology\n\nSmartphone still a game-changer\n\nAnd the technology that will still be driving our future for the next decade is the mobile smartphone. Paired with the internet, cloud services and artificial intelligence, it\u2019s a superpower in our pocket, and Africa will be the last continent to tackle this bastion of growth.\n\n\u201cMost Africans have a feature phone, not a smartphone \u2013 five years ago feature phones outside of South Africa and parts of the middle east dominated, but now you have countries where a quarter of the phone subscribers have smartphones.\u201d\n\nAnd while Africa is the least connected continent in the world at the moment, Naam believes this headroom creates the potential for new connections to form, including perhaps leapfrogging in some important ways.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s instructive to look at China in some ways \u2013 China went straight from cash-only to a multi-trillion-dollar mobile payments-via-your-phone infrastructure before there was ever mobile payment happening in the US or Europe.\u2019\n\nIn travel, besides being our trusty guide while adventuring in unknown locations, our phone also becomes our most important tool to super connect with others across language barriers.\n\nSkype, for example, launched technology that instantly translates language in a call into the person\u2019s own voice instead of using an out-of-place narrator or robot voice \u2013 just another step to create seamless translation in our Babel-world.\n\n\u201cEveryone is reachable everywhere, everyone has access to educational tools, everyone has access to market prices, everyone has access to digital health solutions.\u201d\n\nREAD: This app turns your phone camera into an all-knowing exploration device\n\nThe gap in tech adoption\n\nBut as with any amazing new advancements, there\u2019s always a big gap between developed and developing nations in terms of tech adoption \u2013 and us Africans always feel like we\u2019re ten years behind everyone else.\n\nNaam however believes that gap is becoming ever shorter in the digital sphere. By 2025, there will be 500 million mobile internet users in Africa, but when it comes to larger, more physical infrastructure we still have a long way to go.\n\n\u201cPut it this way \u2013 almost every African household will have a high-bandwidth smart device before every African household has a toilet.\u201d\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t mean the digital can\u2019t also help fill in the gaps in physical infrastructure \u2013 farmers could have an app that lets them \u2018Uber\u2019 a tractor when they can\u2019t afford to buy one.\n\nALSO SEE: Sawubona! Soon you'll be able to use the instant photo function on Google Translate for Zulu, Xhosa and Sesotho\n\nBut is South Africa ready for the future to come?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure any place is ready. People have to be introduced to something, get used to the idea and it has to go slowly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I do think there\u2019s a problem with people in tech, that we assume \u2018oh we\u2019ll give people something and they\u2019ll just love it\u2019 - we don\u2019t think of the backlash or the fear.\u201d\n\nRecently electric car charging stations were launched at hotels across SA to bolster the idea of e-mobility in a country dominated by distances, but when you hear the price tag of some of these stations and vehicles, you just wonder if we\u2019ll ever see this coveted electric future.\n\nYet as we face off another round of Eskom load shedding and doomsday predictions of the state of our planet, change is more likely to come about forcefully, whether we\u2019re ready or not.\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
