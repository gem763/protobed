Saturday's game in Yokohama decides who wins the pool.\n\nCoach Eddie Jones has been questioned over how much he's played Vunipola recently. Vunipola has started all England's games at the Rugby World Cup, although he came off at halftime against the Pumas having received treatment on his ankle on the field.\n\nEngland's Billy Vunipola carries the ball against Argentina defense during the Rugby World Cup Pool C game at Tokyo Stadium in Tokyo, Japan, Saturday, Oct. 5, 2019.

He has been replaced by Wayne Barnes of England.\n\nBarnes' place as assistant referee will be filled by Alex Ruiz of France.\n\nThe other assistant is still Federico Anselmi of Argentina, and the Television Match Officia remains Marius Jonker of South Africa.\n\n___\n\n8:25 a.m.\n\nThree matches are scheduled Wednesday at the Rugby World Cup on the 20th day of the tournament that is moving towards the end of pool play. Organizers, however, are concerned about a typhoon that could affect matches on the weekend.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis could hit Japan on Saturday, when three matches are scheduled. Four more are set for Sunday, the final day of the preliminary round.\n\n\"We are currently monitoring the development of a typhoon off the south coast of Japan in partnership with our weather information experts,\" World Rugby said in a statement. \"It is still too early to determine what, if any, impact there will be on match or training activities.\"\n\nOn Saturday, New Zealand plays Italy, England takes on France and Ireland plays Samoa at Fukuoka, which is situated on the north shore of Kyushu Island and appears to be the match most threatened by the typhoon.\n\nClear and sunny skies are expected at all three venues on Wednesday, when Argentina plays the United States at Kumagaya near Tokyo, Scotland takes on Russia at Shizuoka and Wales plays Fiji at Oita.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nReferee Wayne Barnes gestures to the players during the Rugby World Cup Pool B game at Shizuoka Stadium Ecopa between South Africa and Italy, in Shizuoka, Japan, Friday, Oct. 4, 2019.
