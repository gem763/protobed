And this time I\u2019m gonna do it my way.\u201d Jackson\u2019s 1986 hit keeps playing as the camera follows Destiny from behind as she hits the strip-club stage for the first time, her face briefly lighting up as she gently spins around the pole to cheers and applause.\n\nWhen Destiny steps offstage, flushed and happy, a drunk Wall Street bro beckons her to his table, and her fleeting spell of confidence and Jackson\u2019s song halt simultaneously. \u201cHey, Lucy Liu,\u201d he yells. \u201cCome here. This is my boy Danny. Can you show him a good time?\u201d The camera cuts to a dead-eyed Destiny rapidly humping an old man in a private room.\n\nWriter-director Lorene Scafaria says that Jackson\u2019s \u201cControl\u201d was so essential to the opening scene that she\u2019s not sure what she would\u2019ve done had Jackson said no to licensing the song. \u201cI said out of the gate, \u2018If we don\u2019t get this, I don\u2019t know what this movie is.\u2019 There\u2019s a theme of control that runs throughout the movie, and I didn\u2019t want to make any bones about it \u2014 I wanted that to be very clear,\u201d Scafaria says. \u201cWhen we have it, when we don\u2019t. Even when we\u2019re empowered, it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re in control. I wanted to start the movie on Destiny and follow her from the locker room onto the floor, and use that song as part of the storytelling to not just put us in her shoes but to ask us some questions while we\u2019re with her in real time.\u201d\n\nAccording to music supervisor Jason Markey, the licensing for \u201cControl\u201d came down to the wire. When I spoke to him a few weeks before the film\u2019s premiere, he told me he was \u201csweating, to be honest.\u201d Though Universal, who owns Jackson\u2019s masters, had given the film the go-ahead to use the song, they told Markey they couldn\u2019t get ahold of Jackson while she was on tour to get the final approvals. \u201cI said, \u2018There\u2019s no backing out. This is in the movie. We can\u2019t take it out at this point, so we need this approved,\u2019\u201d says Markey. \u201cI always have anxiety, but this was beyond anxiety. I doubled the Xanax.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Markey and his team sent actual footage of the opening scene to Jackson that she finally gave her blessing. \u201cAfter she saw the clip, she loved it,\u201d he says with palpable relief. \u201cIt\u2019s like giving birth. I was walking in circles all day long, pacing, anxiety, bad dreams, you name it. Let\u2019s just say we pulled off a miracle, okay?\u201d\n\nThe rest of the Hustlers\u2019 soundtrack \u2014 a combination of mid-aughts pop and hip-hop, Chopin cues, and classic rock \u2014 was just as nonnegotiable for Scafaria, who wrote music cues directly into the script, before she even knew she had the directing job. She went so far as to pen personal letters to some of the artists. The cues \u201cmade the script feel like a musical in my head,\u201d she says. \u201cSo we shot to specific songs, timed things out to specific songs, and edited to those songs \u2026 and hoped we\u2019d get the rights.\u201d\n\nBelow, we picked out ten songs from the soundtrack and asked Scafaria, Markey, and editor Kayla Emter to tell us the stories \u2014 both stressful and sweet \u2014 behind the selection and licensing of each one.\n\n1. \u201cControl\u201d and \u201cMiss You Much,\u201d Janet Jackson\n\nAfter shooting the entirety of Hustlers in 29 days, Scafaria went straight to the editing room with Emter, who\u2019d edited her previous film, The Meddler. The two played with soundtrack options, pausing the film and playing a variety of songs over the scenes, all the while cutting the film together. \u201cWe kind of joke about it, but we\u2019d be up till 2 a.m., 4 a.m., just editing, exploring all of the options. We\u2019d plug in her computer, her phone, she\u2019ll just skip through tracks in the room and we\u2019ll just push Play on the edit and mute it and see what emotion comes from the music,\u201d says Emter. \u201cLorene left the editing room and didn\u2019t stop working, which I always found really inspiring \u2014 she\u2019d come back and go, \u2018What if we use this music, or this ADR line?\u2019 It really made me up my game as a contributor.\u201d\n\nBut most of the music was locked down, at least in Scafaria\u2019s mind, all the way back in 2016, when she first drafted the script. \u201cI always knew I wanted to bookend the movie with Janet,\u201d she says. While Jackson\u2019s \u201cControl\u201d opens the film, the softer \u201cMiss You Much\u201d closes it, playing over a bittersweet montage of Ramona and Destiny\u2019s friendship. \u201cShe captures a sound and is an icon \u2014 larger than Ramona\u2019s iconography, even,\u201d adds Scafaria. \u201cSo I like the idea that it begins and ends with Janet.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cCriminal,\u201d Fiona Apple\n\nPerhaps the most mind-blowing music cue in the entire film occurs about ten minutes in, when Jennifer Lopez, as veteran stripper Ramona, takes the stage and slowly strips to Fiona Apple\u2019s \u201cCriminal.\u201d The song choice feels like a low-key feminist dog whistle: Lopez motorboats finance bros and smiles on cue for her drunken public but takes a deep pleasure in her own staggering physical achievements, set to cheeky lyrics likely lost on the men she\u2019s performing for.\n\nThough Lopez initially wanted to dance to a cover of \u201cWicked Game\u201d for the scene, Scafaria suggested \u201cCriminal\u201d instead, and Lopez loved the idea. \u201cI love the tempo, I love what it says, I\u2019m obsessed with the song and in love with Fiona Apple,\u201d says Scafaria. \u201cThe lyrics, the storytelling of it, the mood of it, the power of it, the seduction of it \u2014 there\u2019s something layered to it. It\u2019s about a lot more than it sounds like it\u2019s about. I felt like it perfectly entered Ramona into the story and gave that character a really great showcase and entrance. There\u2019s something emotional about it, too \u2014 that was the feeling I wanted to get across from Destiny\u2019s POV. And I loved that it was a song that Ramona would choose for herself.\u201d\n\nThe catch: Apple had never before licensed the song for a film. So Scafaria sent her the sequence and crossed her fingers. \u201cJennifer learned an entire routine to this edited version, and if Fiona didn\u2019t give us rights, I\u2019m not sure what we would\u2019ve done,\u201d she says. Fortunately, Apple said yes. Markey thinks it\u2019s because she \u201cliked the women empowerment involved, and is probably a fan of Jen\u2019s, which helps.\u201d But Scafaria thinks it might\u2019ve been the dance itself.\n\n3. \u00c9tudes, Op. 25, No. 1, in A-flat major, written by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fran\u00e7ois Chopin, performed by L.H. Thomas\n\nHustlers doesn\u2019t have a traditional score, but Scafaria scatters several Chopin \u00e9tudes throughout the film: when Ramona teaches Destiny to pole-dance, when the elated women sit down for a warm and luxurious Christmas at the height of their success, when Destiny thinks back on her tattered friendship with Ramona. Scafaria says the \u00e9tudes were the first musical cues she dreamt up back in 2016.\n\n\u201cIt started with the Chopin cues, these studies designed to teach very difficult arpeggios. I found a similarity between the difficulty and the flexibility and dexterity of playing those pieces to the strippers on the pole, and what\u2019s required of them in order to do those dances, as well as the strength it takes just to walk through the room,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd they score the love story between Destiny and Ramona.\u201d\n\nGetting the rights to these specific pieces, most of which were played by German pianist L.H. Thomas, was, naturally, a challenge. \u201cWe spent six months trying to find him, and we couldn\u2019t. It was impossible. I have called friends in Germany who are musicians, and they\u2019d never heard of the guy. It was crazy,\u201d says Markey.\n\n\u201cThen one of the women who worked with me found some random ad of his, about one of his albums, and it led to us finding his email address. We\u2019d been sweating that one, too, forever.\u201d\n\n4. \u201cGimme More,\u201d Britney Spears\n\nAs Destiny learns the ropes from Ramona, the two begin raking in cash, buying shoes and fur coats and couture with piles of $1 bills. In an early montage, the friends are sitting inside a massive Escalade at a harshly lit car dealership. Ramona reaches over to the radio and turns the dial. Britney\u2019s unmistakable growl blares from the speakers: \u201cIt\u2019s Britney, bitch.\u201d Ramona and Destiny start dancing uncontrollably in their seats. \u201cWe got a pocket full of ones!\u201d screams Ramona, laughing, as she turns up the music, to the chagrin of the surrounding male salesmen.\n\n\u201cThis was another one written into the script that felt so important to the time period,\u201d says Scafaria. \u201cI was so desperate to see this in the montage. I was like, \u2018It just has to be Britney and it has to be this song. It\u2019s peak 2007.\u2019\u201d\n\nScafaria was encouraged to do a few takes without \u201cGimme More,\u201d just in case Spears said no, but she refused. \u201cJennifer and I were like, \u2018We can\u2019t! It has to be Britney! We don\u2019t know what to do if it\u2019s not Britney!\u2019 That\u2019s my motherfucking song. I love Britney. She\u2019s one of those artists I have an incredible amount of respect for. She was put through the wringer and she\u2019s on the other side of it. She\u2019s a mother, she has mouths to feed, and to come up during that time \u2014 to be sexualized and scrutinized and built up and torn down and maybe not be taken care of really well along the way \u2014 I feel so much for her. We got so lucky that Britney said yes.\u201d\n\n5. \u201cLove in This Club,\u201d Usher\n\nPerhaps the most iconic meta-cameo in film history happens about a third of the way into Hustlers. It\u2019s the height of 2007, just before the financial crash, and everyone is blindly living their best, most excessive lives. One night, as the dancers are getting ready to hop onstage, Lizzo runs, breathless, into the dressing room. \u201cMotherfucking Usher is here!\u201d she screams. \u201cUsher, bitch!\u201d And Usher himself, resplendent in his own 2007 fit, waltzes into the club in slow motion as \u201cLove in This Club\u201d blares from the speakers. \u201cThe entire scene was made in my dreams, and somehow fully realized,\u201d says Scafaria.\n\n\u201cI wrote \u2018Love in This Club\u2019 into the script, and Usher did have a suggestion for a different song \u2014 I think it was \u2018Bad Girl.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Ooh, it has to be \u201cLove in This Club,\u201d I\u2019m sorry!\u2019 \u201d she laughs. \u201cNot that I\u2019m not a fan of his entire catalogue \u2014 I\u2019m an Usher fan for life. But that is the sound of this scene and this moment, when everything was peaking for everyone and it felt like the sky was raining money, and we weren\u2019t aware of what was right around the corner.\u201d\n\nScafaria says it was easy to get Usher to come around on the song choice. \u201cI think he realized once we were there just how electric the room was, and how much it meant to everyone dancing on the stage, and behind the camera as well. The mood in the room had to be Champagne flowing and money falling.\u201d\n\n6. \u201cNext,\u201d Scott Walker\n\nThe first night of Ramona and Destiny\u2019s scam unfurls in a glorious, syrupy montage of men blissfully passing out in private rooms. \u201cWhat\u2019s your Social Security number?\u201d they whisper to a series of smiling, slightly conscious Wall Streeters, who have no idea their credit cards are being run up by the minute. The whole thing is set to Scott Walker\u2019s cover of Jacques Brel\u2019s bruising, bizarre antiwar song \u201cNext.\u201d It\u2019s perfectly out of step with the rest of the soundtrack and conveys just the right amount of stomach-churning surreality and bleak humor.\n\n\u201cScott Walker is my idol,\u201d says Scafaria. \u201cHis voice is made of a material not on Earth.\u201d She says that she shot the scene to this song and, again, couldn\u2019t imagine how it would work without it. \u201cThis song is so important to capture the tone of the scene, which is so tricky. It\u2019s about a very different thing than what we\u2019re watching, but it still seems to tell the story of it. It\u2019s not a pretty sequence, and for some, it\u2019s wildly uncomfortable. But I think the song lends itself to any interpretation of the scene. You can think, This is so strange and fucked up, or you can think, This is beautiful. And I think there\u2019s something thrilling in using a song that I don\u2019t think people have heard before in a sequence that I don\u2019t think a lot of people have seen before \u2014 unless the sexes are reversed, and you\u2019re reading the news.\u201d\n\nHalfway through filming the movie, and before Scafaria could ask for the rights to the song, Walker passed away. \u201cI was really heartbroken. I\u2019ve never met him; I\u2019m just a fan from afar. But I was also worried that we weren\u2019t going to get the rights to that song because of estates, at that point. I felt like I could write him a personal letter and hopefully get through, because that song was so crucial to this montage.\u201d Fortunately, the song cleared, and the sequence stands as one of the strangest and most memorable in the film.\n\n7. \u201cBirthday Cake,\u201d Rihanna\n\nIt\u2019s the height of the strippers\u2019 scam. Ramona\u2019s in a massive fur coat, storming into the club in slow motion, surrounded by her equally radiant friends. Money rains from the rafters. \u201cWe brought 100 grand into the club,\u201d Ramona brags in voice-over. In the background, Rihanna is extolling the virtues of cake.\n\n\u201cRihanna was the last approval we had to get, and I wrote a letter to her,\u201d says Scafaria. \u201cI wrote about what she means to me, what she\u2019s meant to all women over the years \u2014 being a self-made woman and being on Forbes lists.\u201d For Scafaria, Rihanna was something of a soul mate to the Hustlers characters. \u201cI loved telling the stories about all of these women who rose out of where they came from and did a lot with the hand they were given. We\u2019re all dealt a certain hand of cards, and I really just admire everything that Rihanna made of herself. She does everything with what seems like kindness and grace, but also an incredible amount of power and strength.\u201d\n\nApparently, Rihanna saw similar parallels, and agreed to license the song. \u201cTo hear her voice during that scene when the women are at the height of their power \u2014 that felt very important to me,\u201d says Scafaria.\n\n8. \u201cDance (A$$),\u201d Big Sean\n\nImmediately after the \u201cBirthday Cake\u201d scene, we\u2019re transported to Ramona\u2019s new luxury apartment, where a group of burly movers are attempting to lug her tanning bed up a set of stairs and fit it through the door. As they struggle and sweat, Big Sean sings sweetly: \u201cAss, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat transition was so great,\u201d laughs Scafaria. \u201cI knew I wanted to go seamlessly from song to song, like a DJ does at a club. These songs just went together so perfectly. I love going from the women walking into the club to Rihanna\u2019s voice, to the men moving the tanning bed with this male voice. It ended up going perfectly with how they struggle with the tanning bed \u2014 it went along with the lyrics. And then to see Jennifer and Constance in their Juicy tracksuits, living the high life in that moment, was really fun.\u201d\n\n9. \u201cNight Moves,\u201d Bob Seger\n\nNear the end of Hustlers, when shit is going down in every sense, Dawn (Madeline Brewer) sells out her fellow scammers to the cops and participates in a jittery, chaotic sting operation. The score to the whole thing is unexpected, but absolutely perfect: Bob Seger\u2019s \u201cNight Moves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to give credit to Kayla, who channeled that song \u2014 it wasn\u2019t written into the script,\u201d says Scafaria. \u201cShe had the sheet music for \u2018Night Moves\u2019 on the wall in a frame in our editing room. At the end of a particularly rough day, we\u2019d always put it on to feel better. When we came to that part of the story where the cops take over the narrative in a way, I said, \u2018I feel like the cops need their own soundtrack, their own sound.\u2019 We\u2019re outside of the club, so they need a song that really tells their story.\u201d\n\nAt first, Seger wasn\u2019t exactly onboard. \u201cHe was very on the fence with the movie,\u201d says Markey. \u201cI think one thing that could have possibly been the reason was the drugs. A lot of artists don\u2019t like to be associated with any drugs. But I said, \u2018Look, nobody got hurt. There\u2019s no harm here.\u2019 It\u2019s not an optimal situation for anybody to get roofied or drugged, but nobody got harmed, nobody died.\u201d\n\nEventually, Seger came around. \u201cHe saw the clip and ended up really liking it. So I think everything worked out in the end,\u201d says Markey. When I point out that it\u2019s a little ironic that a 1960s rock star didn\u2019t want to be associated with drugs, he laughs. \u201cNo shit, right? This guy probably did more blow than anybody.\u201d\n\n10. \u201cRoyals,\u201d Lorde\n\nRamona, clad in a black Juicy suit with a crown decal, heads to the ATM to withdraw some cash, her heels pounding the pavement in time with Lorde\u2019s voice. Suddenly, she\u2019s surrounded by cops. She raises her hands over her head as Lorde croons, \u201cWe\u2019ll never be royals, it don\u2019t run in our blood,\u201d subtly underscoring the movie\u2019s points about control, class, and capitalism. One by one, each of the women are rounded up and arrested. The door to their communal jail cell clangs shut just as Lorde sings, \u201cAnd I\u2019m in love with being queen.\u201d\n\nScafaria had her heart set on \u201cRoyals\u201d and shot Lopez walking specifically to the song. But it was perhaps the longest shot of the entire soundtrack. \u201cThat song\u2019s never been licensed for a film,\u201d says Markey. \u201cLorde is just very \u2014 she just doesn\u2019t care about things. She\u2019s very passive when it comes to that. She\u2019s very precious and she usually just says no.\u201d\n\nSo Markey, who says most of his job involves \u201cbegging,\u201d got to work. \u201cI called my friend Jonathan Daniel, who\u2019s her manager, and pleaded with him to let us have that song. We think it\u2019s so badass. And we sent her a clip of the movie.\u201d Scafaria also wrote Lorde a letter, explaining what the song meant to her and to the scene. Ultimately, Lorde agreed to license her first-ever song to a film.\n\nI asked Markey what he thinks Lorde loved, specifically, about the scene. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he says. \u201cWomen [artists] have just been rising up and realizing this is such an important movie, and giving us approvals based on that.\u201d", "description": "Fiona Apple had never licensed \u201cCriminal\u201d \u2014 until Lorene Scafaria and Jennifer Lopez came calling.
