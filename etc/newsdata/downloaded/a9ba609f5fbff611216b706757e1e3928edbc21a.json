It\u2019ll never get to that, but it\u2019s clear if the NCAA enforcement staff has its way, it could get to something significant.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWhat\u2019s that old Jerry Tarkanian line about Kentucky and Cleveland State? Well, not this time. The NCAA is so mad at Kansas, it might give Kansas two more years of probation.\n\nPerhaps the association felt the need to act after the federal basketball fraud trials of the past two years dragged its general impotence into the spotlight. It was clear through weeks of testimony and wiretaps that no one respected or feared the NCAA.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what Self is claiming. In a statement, he cried about the NCAA\u2019s \u201cunnecessary aggressive manner\u201d born from \u201cits haste and attempt to regain control.\u201d He declared it all a \u201cfalse narrative.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of rhetoric that is rarely thrown at the NCAA, whose infractions committee has generally given leniency to those who play nice and admit wrongdoing. It\u2019s unlikely there is going to be much cooperation this time. The lines in the sand have been drawn.\n\n\u201cThe narrative is based on innuendo, half-truths, misimpressions and mischaracterizations,\u201d Self said.\n\nStory continues\n\nWell, that should play well among the KU faithful but the reality is that much of the notice of allegations comes from the under-oath federal testimony and other evidence provided from T.J. Gassnola, a longtime Self confidant and friend who also served as a so-called \u201cbag man\u201d for Adidas grassroots basketball.\n\nKansas Jayhawks head coach Bill Self reacts during the first half in the second round of the 2019 NCAA Tournament. (USAT)\n\nGassnola is the kind of figure the NCAA usually never gets to interview. With no way to compel cooperation, figures such as Gassnola, who doubled as a Massachusetts AAU coach, would never speak with the NCAA \u2014 let alone share bank records or cell phones.\n\nHowever, once the FBI and the Southern District of New York began charging figures in a scandal that played out two years ago, Gassnola took a non-prosecution deal to avoid trouble.\n\nThat meant handing over texts and other communication between he, Self and KU assistant Kurtis Townsend. That meant nearly two days on the stand in a Manhattan courtroom where he detailed how he met and paid various Kansas recruits (among others) so they would play for his buddy Self and the Adidas-sponsored Jayhawks. That meant bank statements and wire transfers to back it all up.\n\nSelf claims, \u201cThere is only one version of the truth\u201d and that \u201cthe truth is based on verifiable facts, and I am confident the facts we will demonstrate in our case will expose the inaccuracies of the enforcement staff\u2019s narrative.\u201d\n\nThose better be some good facts because they would, presumably, also have to prove that Gassnola is a liar and that he duped both the FBI and seasoned federal prosecutors in New York.\n\nGood luck with that one.\n\nKansas has previously claimed it was just a victim of Adidas, a public-relations line that went from laughable to pathetic when it quickly re-upped to another endorsement deal with its so-called victimizers.\n\nIn truth, they are part of a symbiotic business relationship that only exists because of the NCAA's ethically bankrupt amateurism rules. In this, Kansas took millions from Adidas, which in turn protected its investment by steering many of its best high school players to the school so the Jayhawks would keep winning Big 12 championships.\n\nIn the process, Self got rich and into the Hall of Fame. Kansas sold out its gym and showed up on ESPN a couple times a week.\n\nThe players didn\u2019t get much.\n\nThe rules that create the underground economy should be abolished, but as long as they exist, Kansas and Self should be forced to follow them.\n\nIt\u2019s not like they don\u2019t know what is going on. Self is a smart guy, not some rube who really thought the best players in the country, many of whom coincidentally played in the Adidas grassroots system, arrived in Lawrence because they like watching sunsets over wheat fields.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy with Adidas,\u201d Self texted Gassnola right after KU and the shoe company agreed to a $191 million deal. \u201cJust got to get a couple of real guys.\u201d\n\nGee, Bill, that must be the innuendo part.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, it\u2019s KU, Bill Self,\u201d Gassnola texted back, intimating how Kansas deserved the best players before other Adidas schools such as Louisville and North Carolina State got theirs. \u201cEveryone else fall into line. Too [expletive] bad. That\u2019s what\u2019s right for Adidas basketball. And I know I am RIGHT. The more you win, have lottery pics [sic] and you happy. That\u2019s how it should work in my mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how ur [sic] works. At UNC and Duke,\u201d Self texted, mentioning a couple of Nike-sponsored schools.\n\nSoon enough, Gassnola was out looking for real guys. That meant coincidentally meeting the mother of Billy Preston at a Lawrence hotel and the beginning of payments that totaled $89,000. That meant working with the guardian of Silvio De Sousa, all while texting back and forth with Self, to the tune of $20,000.\n\n\u201cI talked with [the guardian],\u201d Gassnola texted Self on the eve of the college decision.\n\n\u201cWe good?\u201d Self asked.\n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d Gassnola texted. \u201cThat\u2019s [sic] was light work. Ball is in his court now.\u201d\n\nMore innuendo, of course. Mischaracterizations. Or something.\n\nThe evidence that was laid out in court was damning and dramatic. It was clear Kansas didn\u2019t care. The question was whether the NCAA was going to.\n\nIt showed Monday it did. Now Self is basically declaring it all a witch hunt and counting on KU to circle the wagons.\n\nThis time the NCAA appears to be itching for a fight, as well. Thanks to the FBI, it might actually have enough ammo to win.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Self has essentially declared the NCAA's allegations a witch hunt and is counting on KU to circle the wagons.
