Finding ways to win as you\u2019re getting better as a team is a good thing.\u201d\n\nThe Eagles had a chance after Malcolm Jenkins blocked Matt Prater\u2019s 46-yard field goal try with 1:53 left. Rasul Douglas returned it to the Lions 22, but an illegal block on Jenkins pushed it back to midfield.\n\nOn fourth-and-5, Darren Sproles caught a pass for a first down but got called for Philadelphia\u2019s third offensive pass interference. Wentz\u2019s deep pass to J.J. Arcega-Whiteside fell incomplete with 41 seconds left. The rookie receiver said he should\u2019ve caught it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the moment you ask for and dream about,\u201d Arcega-Whiteside said. \u201cI gotta make the play.\u201d\n\nThe Lions (2-0-1) remain undefeated and the Eagles (1-2) have lost two in a row.\n\nAgnew got Detroit started by going the distance after Philadelphia jumped ahead 3-0. He atoned for mistakes in the first two games.\n\n\u201cI owe it to my teammates and the coaching staff for sticking with me,\u201d he said.\n\nLions coach Matt Patricia sensed Agnew would breakout.\n\n\u201cHe was working and he was grinding,\u201d Patricia said. \u201cGive him all the credit in the world.\u201d\n\nJones had six catches for 116 yards, including a 12-yard TD reception that extended Detroit\u2019s lead to 27-17 on the first play of the fourth quarter.\n\nCarson Wentz threw a pair of touchdown passes to Nelson Agholor, but came up yards short on a scramble on fourth-and-8 late in the fourth.\n\nThe Eagles\u2019 injury-depleted offense missing its top two receivers was sloppy.\n\nMiles Sanders and Agholor lost fumbles, there were a few drops, and wideout Mack Hollins committed two pass-interference penalties.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t make excuses,\u201d Agholor said. \u201cWe had opportunities. We have to make plays.\u201d\n\nWentz clearly missed DeSean Jackson and Alshon Jeffery as receivers struggled to get open. Jackson didn\u2019t play because of an abdomen injury and Jeffery has a calf strain.\n\nThe Eagles cut it to 27-24 when Wentz threw a 2-yard TD pass to Agholor with 6:59 left. Penalties cost the Lions on that drive. A late hit on Wentz against Trey Flowers extended it and an unnecessary roughness call on Jarrad Davis moved the ball to the 5.\n\nWentz threw a 20-yard TD pass to Agholor in the third quarter. But the Lions answered with Stafford\u2019s TD to Jones.\n\nKerryon Johnson\u2019s 1-yard TD run gave the Lions a 14-10 lead early in the second quarter.\n\nSanders fumbled twice on one drive and Detroit recovered his second one. That led to Prater\u2019s 25-yard field goal and a 17-10 lead.\n\nJordan Howard ran in from the 1 after Wentz scrambled 19 yards on third-and-6, giving the Eagles a 10-7 lead in the first quarter.\n\nFIRST ONE\n\nAgnew had the first kickoff return for a score this season. There were five in the NFL last year.\n\nTHE REMATCH\n\nPatricia was on the other sideline as New England\u2019s defensive coordinator when Nick Foles led the Eagles to a 41-33 win over the Patriots in the Super Bowl two seasons ago.\n\nFAMILIAR FOE\n\nStafford now is 2-1 against Jim Schwartz, the Eagles defensive coordinator who was a first-year head coach when Detroit drafted the quarterback No. 1 overall in 2009.\n\nMISSED CALL\n\nSanders had his helmet ripped off on a kickoff return when he was clotheslined by Miles Killebrew, who also grabbed the facemask and spun it around. There was no penalty called. The blatant miss was nearly as obvious as the non-call on the pass interference in the Rams-Saints NFC championship game. Todd Prukop was the back judge for both games.\n\nFAST START\n\nThe Eagles scored 10 points in the first quarter after scoring only 20 points combined in the previous 12 first quarters.\n\nINJURIES\n\nLions: DT Mike Daniels (foot) left in the first quarter and didn\u2019t return and Slay (hamstring) exited in the third quarter.\n\nEagles: CB Ronald Darby (hamstring) and LT Andre Dillard (knee) left in the first half.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLions: Host Kansas City next Sunday. The Chiefs won the previous matchup 45-10 on Nov. 1, 2015, but the Lions have won the past two times at home.\n\nEagles: At Green Bay on Thursday night. The Packers have won five of the past six meetings, including a 53-20 rout at Lambeau Field on Nov. 16, 2014.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jamal Agnew quickly made up for two fumbles and the defense stepped up for Detroit when special teams almost blew it.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rob Maaddi"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/lions_eagles_football_05547_c0-150-3582-2238_s1770x1032.jpg?dce055bcc4693306f83acd2cca9db24bb4d1d424", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
