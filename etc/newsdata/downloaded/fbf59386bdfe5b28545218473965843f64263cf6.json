It's where we met and where we got engaged so it only makes sense that we'd have it at Australia Zoo.\n\n\"See, I think this wedding is going to be unique because it's going to be at the zoo with tons of animals.\"\n\nBindi agreed, adding: \"I'm not sure how many people have walked down the aisle with a koala, but we may be setting some new trends for weddings from here on out.\"\n\n(Image: Elder Ordonez / SplashNews.com)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nLater, the 21 year-old gushed: \"The easiest part of wedding planning is just knowing that I get to marry this amazing guy.\n\n\"Whatever else happens, it doesn't matter.\"\n\nChandler was quick to return the heaps of praise, saying: \"How lucky I am, I get the most beautiful girl in the world.\n\n\"I'm marrying into the most wonderful family.\"\n\n(Image: GC Images)\n\n(Image: AFP)\n\nThe wedding joy comes amid family drama involving late dad Steve's sister Joy.\n\nShe told Daily Mail Australia that Steve's wife and kids had cut themselves off after the legendary zookeeper died.\n\nJoy told: \"I keep away from all that. It's just very sad...family stuff.\"\n\nIt was also rumoured that Bindi's granddad - Steve's dad Bob - was involved in a feud with other family members after he said he reckoned he wouldn't get an invite to the wedding.\n\nA koala won't be the only one accompanying Bindi down the aisle - walking her down will be brother Robert.\n\nRobert recently retweeted an image that Bindi had shared of her wedding dress, writing: \"Can't wait to walk you down the aisle.\"\n\nBindi came back: \"I love you. Thank you for being the best brother.\"\n\nIt's thought mum Terri will step in for Steve during the traditional father-daughter dance.", "description": "Bindi Irwin hopes she'll be 'setting some new trends' during her wedding to long-term boyfriend Chandler Powell", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Elder Ordonez", "Splashnews.Com", "Pa", "Gc Images", "Afp"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20534963.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Steve-Irwins-family-ripped-apart-by-sad-fallout-13-years-after-his-death.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
