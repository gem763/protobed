Photo: Jeremy Daniel\n\nThe press representative who handed me my tickets for Alexis Scheer\u2019s Our Dear Dead Drug Lord gave me a warning before I headed up the stairs to the theater: No spoilers. But like, for super-serious. Reveal nothing that happens in the last 20 minutes, please and thank you.\n\nThis is standard but, here, unfortunate. The thing is, to talk about Our Dear Dead Drug Lord at all, I need to be able to talk about the last 20 minutes. Because that\u2019s where, theatrically and morally, the play both makes its biggest bid for self-definition and, also, utterly collapses. Scheer is trying, or at least happy, to shock, but her play muscles its way into territory that\u2019s something other than \u201cfierce,\u201d \u201cintense,\u201d \u201cunapologetic,\u201d \u201ctransgressive\u201d \u2014 all those words we use to praise big scary gestures onstage. In the name of feminism and liberation, Our Dear Dead Drug Lord ends up in a place of violent solipsism. It disturbs, but not because we can feel \u2014 as it wants us to \u2014 old and ugly systems breaking, but because we can sense new, powerful, self-deluding uglinesses emerging. It\u2019s a manifesto play, but I can\u2019t get behind its particular take on the revolution.\n\nHow do we end up in such dicey terrain? Well, it\u2019s always good to start by killing an animal. Scheer has described Our Dear Dead Drug Lord as \u201cMean Girls meets Narcos\u201d: Its characters are four wild-eyed Miami high-school girls who meet in a ramshackle treehouse in 2008 to attempt to summon the spirit of Colombian kingpin Pablo Escobar. Before too much time has passed in the show, their newest recruit \u2014 the sexy, surly, super-cool Kit (Rebecca Jimenez) \u2014 reaches into a cardboard box and snaps the neck of a (mercifully unseen) cat. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill it! That would make us, like, psychopaths!\u201d protests Zoom (Alyssa May Gold), the group\u2019s youngest member, a keyed-up, green-haired, conspiracy-theory-flinging romantic. \u201cIt\u2019s a sacrificial offering, it\u2019s different,\u201d barks Pipe (Carmen Berkeley), the group\u2019s undisputed leader \u2014 a senior, ambitious and ruthless and, though she rejects the label, a Young Republican. Squeeze (Malika Samuel), the flirty, ambivalent one, just wants to stop sneezing. \u201cI\u2019m literally gonna die if you don\u2019t kill it!\u201d she squeals.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m with Zoom. But Our Dear Dead Drug Lord skates right on by the grisly sacrifice and into more fizzy, mile-a-minute millennial banter. Like Erica Schmidt\u2019s terrible-teens take on Macbeth at Red Bull Theater earlier this year, the play is riding a very fine line between saying something about the glamour of violence and simply reveling in it. While she was still working on it, Scheer called Our Dear Dead Drug Lord \u201cpart indictment on [sic] the American celebritization of criminals, and part girls just growing up and trying to figure out where the limit is.\u201d Whether her intentions shifted as she wrote, who knows, but the final form of Our Dear Dead Drug Lord indicts nothing. Rather, it builds toward a climax that blurs the line between finding one\u2019s power and using it to injure, self-absolve, and take.\n\nIf it weren\u2019t apparent from the warning signs in the lobby and the insert in our programs, the play itself makes it pretty obvious that, before we\u2019re all done in this treehouse, there will be blood. Part of the issue with Scheer\u2019s trajectory is technical: We\u2019re not really given the means to believe that her characters would go where she wants them to end up. We get the obligatory slice of background trauma for most of them \u2014 Squeeze\u2019s father committed suicide, Kit never knew her dad and is haunted by memories of her mother\u2019s menacing ex-boyfriend, and Pipe feels responsible for the accidental death of her little sister \u2014 but, frankly, we\u2019ve all got shit in our lives. And the OMG\u2013Shut UP\u2013I\u2019m LITERALLY dying\u2013Olivia Benson is my spirit animal diction doesn\u2019t lie on top of enough full-bodied character development. Director Whitney White keeps the overlapping patter buzzing along, and she gets tons of zingy energy out of her four strong actors, but especially in the play\u2019s later scenes, the characters start to feel manipulated rather than organic \u2014 no longer real girls but means to a writer\u2019s ends.\n\nThe shame of it is that amid all the aggro witchy stuff, some of the play\u2019s best moments are its silliest and tenderest. A long sequence in which Squeeze teaches the girls a dance tribute to her father intended for the upcoming school talent show \u2014 with moves from the \u201cBroken Umbrella\u201d to the \u201cGrizzly Bear\u201d to the \u201cDazed and Confused\u201d \u2014 is a brilliant, compassionate piece of comedy. Watching the girls take one another seriously and set to work on something so sweet and weird and ridiculous and sad is a hilarious, delicate joy. And then there are the little pops of teenage truthfulness, often from the precocious Pipe, that feel funny, pointed, and wistful all at once. \u201cYou\u2019re 15,\u201d Pipe comforts Zoom. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to find your purpose in life until you apply for college.\u201d Or, later: \u201cPotential is so suffocating.\u201d Or, after tumbling into a kiss with the charismatic Kit: \u201cI didn\u2019t even realize \u2014 I\u2019m not \u2014 I mean \u2026 I don\u2019t know \u2014 was I sending signals? I \u2026 think I\u2019m attracted to power.\u201d\n\nThere are bright bubbles of humanity in Scheer\u2019s characters, but the play is ultimately and ostentatiously not interested in being humane. As the girls get closer and closer to summoning Pablo\u2019s spirit (why? It doesn\u2019t really matter \u2014 because magic, because control, because power), it\u2019s clear that Our Dear Dead Drug Lord is coming to the edge of its cliff. It can stay in the real world, where Ouija boards don\u2019t work and we\u2019ve all got to find a way to live with each other, or it can make a leap. And it makes one into a chasm of muddled morality and avoided consequences. (Some semi-spoilers ahead now.)\n\nIn the mounting frenzy of the show\u2019s ending, an act of extreme violence leads to an evocation of the \u201cGlorious Quaternity of Womanhood,\u201d and we find ourselves in a new universe, a place where magic diverges from morality. It\u2019s a shift with a nasty undertow. In the end, Our Dear Dead Drug Lord values defiance and self-assertion past the point of shared humanity and responsibility. Like Pipe, the play in its final form is attracted to power, but not simply as a reasonable response to the painful experience of smallness or denigration in the world, but for power\u2019s own glossy, merciless sake. It takes a stand against being \u201csorry\u201d or being \u201cgood,\u201d painting those terms as simplistic and belittling, simply shackles to be discarded.\n\nIf you feel that you\u2019ve been crippled by a life of apology and self-effacement, then the battle cry espoused by Our Dear Dead Drug Lord might hold some appeal \u2014 it might be the first step. But it can\u2019t be the last. Defiance must be preceded by thoughtfulness, self-assertion balanced by self-criticism. We must all, sometimes, be sincerely sorry \u2014 not because of who we are but because of the things we do \u2014 and we must all, always, keep struggling to define goodness, and to offer it whenever possible not only to ourselves but to our fellow struggling animals. The rush of empowerment offered by Dear Dead Drug Lord is a dangerous high: It gives its girls and its audience the opportunity to let ourselves off the hook. It\u2019s a revolution with little use for kindness, ambivalence, or reflection. It is not my revolution.\n\nOur Dear Dead Drug Lord, produced by the Women\u2019s Project and Second Stage Theater, is at Second Stage through October 20.", "description": "Theater Review: Alexis Scheer\u2019s \u2018Our Dear Dead Drug Lord,\u2019 Produced by the Women\u2019s Project With Second Stage", "authors": ["Sara Holdren"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/24/24-our-dear-drug-lord.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
