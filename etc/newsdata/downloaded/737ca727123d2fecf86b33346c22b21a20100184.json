But they do \u2013 that saying is a lie.\n\nThis week, the international disability charity, Leonard Cheshire, found that in 2018/19 disability hate crime rose by 22 per cent.\n\nI\u2019m one of the people who have experienced hate crime and I want to make sure everyone understands how damaging it can be.\n\nI was on the receiving end of verbal abuse in a space that I thought was safe; I was online gaming in the comfort of my own home.\n\nWhat happened to me was this: A person joined our party online, appearing nice to me and my friends. But as soon as he realised I had a disability he wanted a private chat and started using words like \u2018spaz\u2019 and \u2018cripple\u2019 to offend me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis came completely out of the blue and I felt hurt. But I doubt I\u2019m the only disabled person to have abuse strike when you\u2019re least expecting it.\n\nNon-disabled people shouldn\u2019t underestimate how hearing these horrid words can make you feel. I\u2019ve spoken with disabled people who have suffered from ongoing abuse and they\u2019ll tell you, no matter how many times these names are thrown at you, it doesn\u2019t get any less hurtful.\n\nWhen it happened to me I felt embarrassed and weak. I have no idea who said this to me from behind their screen, but I think they are cruel and cowardly.\n\nI want to know why people hate others because of disability. I\u2019m sure that this earth was made for us to love one another and look after our fellow humans, not hurt them.\n\nCalling someone a \u2018cripple,\u2019 \u2018spaz\u2019 or \u2018retard\u2019 because they are disabled is offensive and should be taken more seriously by law enforcers\n\nI\u2019ve run hate crime workshops and have seen the impact hate crime can have, whether it is online or in real life, verbal or violent.\n\nPeople lose their confidence and become afraid to leave their homes. For me, it was important to take my experience and talk about it, reaching out to others.\n\nI found it empowering to take this horrible experience and turn it on its head. I thought to myself, \u2018I have a voice, I should inspire other people to speak out and report what they\u2019ve experienced to the police.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut unfortunately, although 5,000 disability hate crimes were reported to the police last year, only six per cent were sent to the Crown Prosecution Service or received a charge or summons.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not even accounting for the people who were too afraid to report to the police in the first place.\n\nCalling someone a \u2018cripple,\u2019 \u2018spaz\u2019 or \u2018retard\u2019 because they are disabled is offensive and should be taken more seriously by law enforcers. And when it\u2019s online, we need the big cyber companies to do more.\n\nI didn\u2019t feel like what I experienced was taken seriously when I reported it to the tech company in question \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t easy to report in the first place.\n\nGiven that many people feel too scared to report and that reporting procedures are often inaccessible, it goes without saying that more needs to be done.\n\nMy experience of hate crime on a gaming platform is only one of many similar stories. Online hate crime rose by 71 per cent in the past year, which is no doubt a depressing statistic.\n\nAnd life offline can be even scarier, with an increase in physical assault (a shocking 92 per cent of police forces reported increasing violence).\n\nThese findings should make everyone sit up and think about how unsafe disabled people must feel.\n\nThis is why I continue to speak to other disabled people about the hate crime we have experienced. Through these conversations I\u2019m learning that it happens everywhere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisabled people need to have the confidence to report it and the knowledge that the police will act on protecting them from the criminals who did this to them.\n\nI hope sharing my story will help other people who have experienced this injustice feel less alone and that their concerns are serious.\n\nIt is never \u2018only\u2019 online, or \u2018only\u2019 verbal. Hate crime is hate crime and nobody should be allowed to get away with it.\n\nMORE: Disability comes with an extortionate and shocking price tag\n\nMORE: Woman charged with hate crime after \u2018abusing people at Pride\u2019\n\nMORE: Man born with facial birthmark says it\u2019s a hate crime to make comments against those with scars and marks", "description": "Disability hate crime has risen by 22 per cent in the past year.", "authors": ["Joshua Reeves"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Josh-Reeves-says-disability-hate-crime-needs-to-be-taken-more-seriously-eee9_1570697260.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
