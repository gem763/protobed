Instead of troops, the new \u201cMini Carriers\u201d would have a squadron of F-35B Lightning II jet fighters.\n\n\u201cI have a demand for carriers right now that I can\u2019t fulfill,\u201d Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer said Wednesday in a briefing for reporters at the Heritage Foundation.\n\nWhile aircraft carriers are the centerpiece of the Navy\u2019s forward-deployed military strategy, they are expensive. The U.S.S. Gerald Ford \u2014 the first in the Ford class of supercarriers \u2014 cost about $12 billion.\n\nMr. Spencer said the U.S. military\u2019s combatant commanders want the overwhelming combat power aircraft carriers give them.\n\n\u201cPart of the mission of the carrier is presence and forward deployability,\u201d he said.\n\nIn World War II, the Navy augmented their fleet with a class of ships called escort carriers, sometimes known as \u201cJeep Carriers\u201d or \u201cBaby Flattops.\u201d They were smaller and carried fewer aircraft but cheaper and quicker to build. While they couldn\u2019t keep up with fast-moving invasion fleets, escort carriers accomplished a variety of missions including protecting convoys from U-boats in the North Atlantic campaign.\n\nIt\u2019s a concept the U.S. Marine Corps has been studying to see if there are modern applications. They are looking to see if an amphibious assault ship called an LHA could be adapted to serve as a new \u201cJeep Carrier.\u201d\n\nThe idea would be to remove the ground troops from a Marine Expeditionary Unit and replace them and their equipment with additional F-35B Lightning II aircraft capable of vertical and short takeoff and landings. It would be possible to have more than 20 such aircraft on an LHA like the U.S.S. America, Mr. Spencer said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve already marked it out [on an LHA]. They did it as a cerebral exercise,\u201d Mr. Spencer said.\n\nAnd if hidebound elements in the Navy don\u2019t like the idea, that\u2019s too bad, he said.\n\n\u201cStand by for a new [Chief of Naval Operations] who is going to tell them to like it,\u201d Mr. Spencer said.\n\nIt\u2019s an informal, out-of-the-box approach that he\u2019d like to see more top Navy and Marine Corps officials take.\n\nThe timeline? \u201cI\u2019d like to see this sooner rather than later,\u201d Mr. Spencer said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
