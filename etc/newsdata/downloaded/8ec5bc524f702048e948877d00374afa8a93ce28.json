I\u2019ve felt shame and keeping such a big secret has taken its toll.\n\n\u201cI was in a dark place, feeling suicidal. I thought about driving off a cliff. To me, wanting to die was just a natural thought and felt like the easier way out, but you have to confront things.\u201d\n\nThe former British Lions captain, 45, who will be a TV pundit in the upcoming Rugby World Cup, said he \u201cbroke down\u201d when he got the news of his diagnosis.\n\nRugby star Gareth Thomas: \u2018I want a black-and-white law so people can deal with homophobia\u2019 Read more\n\nHe explained: \u201cI went for a routine sexual health test at a private clinic in Cardiff. I didn\u2019t feel ill and thought everything was going to be fine.\n\n\u201cWhen (the doctor) said those words ... I immediately thought I was going to die. I felt like an express train was hitting me at 300mph. Then I was thinking \u2018how long have I got left?\u201d\u2019\n\nThe former Cardiff Blues player won 103 caps and scored 41 tries for Wales between 1995 and 2007, and he is 13th on the all-time international test try-scoring list.\n\nLast November, he was attacked in Cardiff city centre in a homophobic hate crime, but asked South Wales police to deal with the 16-year-old assailant by way of restorative justice.\n\nThe sportsman now takes one tablet containing four medications each day, and doctors have said his condition is under control to the point that it is considered \u201cundetectable\u201d and cannot be passed on.\n\nMr Thomas said that his partner \u2013 Stephen \u2013 who he met after his diagnosis and married three years ago, does not have HIV.\n\nHe said he hopes that his openness will help end the stigma around condition, adding: \u201cI\u2019m speaking out because I want to help others and make a difference. I hope me speaking out about my diagnosis will help a lot of people.\u201d", "description": "Ex-British Lions captain believed to be first UK sportsman to go public about living with virus", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e4ae5c66f8c9c62dba5ea5db7c9fde5eb557ccc/0_0_4854_2912/master/4854.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e86554a35a4e1ea111051928f166317b", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
