That caused Day (17-4-1, 6 knockouts) to stumble and seconds later Conwell landed a left hook that knocked Day to the canvas.\n\nThe 27-year-old Day, from Freeport, New York, was instantly knocked out and it wasn\u2019t clear if he regained consciousness. He was treated by a doctor in the ring and then was rushed off on a stretcher by paramedics and transported to the hospital. Day was knocked down twice earlier in the fight.\n\nDiBella said on his verified Twitter account Sunday: \u201cPat Day makes any room he is in a better place. I\u2019ve never met anyone who\u2019s met Patrick and not liked him. Never heard him utter a mean word. Never saw him greet someone without a big smile. Life doesn\u2019t seem fair sometimes. Please keep Pat in your prayers, thoughts, and hearts.\u201d\n\nIn his statement, DiBella conveyed thanks for the outpouring of \u201csupport, prayers and offers of assistance from all corners of the boxing community.\u201d He asked that the privacy of Day and his family be respected at this difficult time.\n\nEddie Hearn, the managing director of the promoter, Matchroom Sport, said after the bout that Day never gave up in the bout.\n\nHearn said: \u201d I think there was 30 seconds left in the final round and he was still trying to win the fight and he was a mile behind in the fight and he could\u2019ve easily not tried to win the fight, but he got knocked out trying to win the fight. \u201c\n\n___\n\nhttps://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Boxer Patrick Day suffered a traumatic brain injury and is in extremely critical condition in a coma caused by the injury sustained in a bout, his manager said Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/boxer_hospitalized_boxing_24013_c0-159-3848-2403_s1200x700.jpg?ec23b6a96703abee6dcd1ed2bb7d07e5381cbf4a", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
