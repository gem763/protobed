It alleges that the marketplace is thus skewed in favor of Trump businesses because of his unlawful receipt of payments from government patrons.\n\nThis is a nice way of saying Trump has set up a giant pay-to-play racket.\n\nThe ruling clearly puts Trump on notice that the definition of emoluments extends to his business dealings with foreign states: \u201cThe prohibition stated in the constitutional text renders the President\u2019s receipt of \u2018emoluments\u2019 unlawful, unless Congress consents to it.\u201d The two-judge majority reiterated that the only way for Trump constitutionally to accept emoluments is with the consent of Congress, something that has not occurred.\n\nThe importance of the ruling is two-fold. First, it sets in motion a second court case in which plaintiffs might gain access to Trump\u2019s financial records, including tax returns. Unless he can get the Supreme Court to stay the order, he\u2019ll have to produce documents or defy legal subpoenas. Second, the ruling underscores the need for the House of Representatives to refocus impeachment hearings on Trump\u2019s alleged financial improprieties \u2014 taking foreign money, self-dealing, directing the Air Force flights to Scotland so crews would patronize his hotel. Trump\u2019s finances and his insatiable greed have always been his Achilles' heel. His self-enrichment is exceedingly easy for anyone to understand and, if supported by evidence, would make it exceptionally hard even for Republicans to defend. The Judiciary Committee would be wise to put out a road map detailing potential financial improprieties, putting Trump and the country on notice that their president might be a crook.\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: The good, the bad and the ugly in the fight over emoluments\n\nJennifer Rubin: Emoluments decision: \u2018Another tremendous step, another tremendous victory\u2019\n\nJennifer Rubin: Another court loss for Trump\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: The framers worried about corruption.
