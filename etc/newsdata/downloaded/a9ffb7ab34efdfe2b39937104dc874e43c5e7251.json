In retaliation, Beijing detained two Canadians, an ex-diplomat and a businessman, for spying, and retried a 36-year-old tourist serving a 15-year drug offense, sentencing him to the death penalty.\n\nIt depicts a real life-based Chinese-Canadian reporter reluctantly taking on the story and risking her life to connect the dots between the company and the Communist Party and the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army. And the film goes behind closed doors to show the scheming of party operatives whose sights are set on global dominance in our lifetimes.\n\nHaving premiered over the weekend on the One America News Network, which will show it again Friday evening, the film is the work of New York-based Chinese-American New Tang Dynasty Television. The production values and acting, particularly Dorren Lee as journalist Jane Li, are top notch. Ex-Trump strategist Steve Bannon, who\u2019s an executive producer, hosted a press screening in New York City last week, where he brandished a well-worn copy of \u201cUnrestricted Warfare,\u201d a 1999 book by two senior Chinese air force colonels. They argue that economic warfare, attacks on digital infrastructure, and terrorism can enable a lesser power to win a war against the U.S., especially as part of a \u201cgrand warfare method\u201d pairing military and non-military tactics. Beijing hasn\u2019t veered far off that strategy in the two decades since.\n\nAs the U.S. and the rest of the industrialized free world transition to 5G, Huawei seeks global market dominance by providing the new infrastructure through artificially low pricing \u2013 and likely bribery and other acts of corruption. It\u2019s tough for other firms to compete when your rival\u2019s got a $100 billion line of credit from its undemocratic government. The U.S. in May imposed bans on Huawei\u2019s access to U.S. technology for fear of the firm incorporating \u201cback doors\u201d in its hardware allowing China to spy in the future.\n\nIn May, I&I detailed the threat, as well as the increasingly prioritized U.S. response. Already covering more than a third of the population of the world in 170 countries, Huawei has been red-lighted by the Trump administration, which now insists that our allies look to other firms to build their countries\u2019 5G high-speed mobile networks, warning that Beijing could use Huawei hardware and future software upgrades for espionage, and even to cripple vital national services or industries that will depend on 5G in only a few years.\n\nBig Brother Beijing Already In 230 International Cities\n\nHuawei\u2019s \u201cSafe Cities\u201d facial recognition surveillance technology is already well entrenched within lesser economies with which Beijing has cultivated deep diplomatic and economic connections, from Angola, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Laos, and Uganda in the Third World, to Turkey, Russia, Serbia and Ukraine, and even France, Italy and Germany, encompassing 230 cities and tens of millions of individuals.\n\nThe National Basketball Association recently found out how swift and brutal the Chinese regime can be when its repression is pointed out even beyond its borders. Beijing demanded that Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey be fired for his now-deleted tweet in support of the people of Hong Kong as they demonstrate against the Chinese communist government for full freedoms.\n\nEven the New York Times, not known for worrying about reds under the bed, editorialized against Beijing and those excusing its behavior in America. \u201cChina\u2019s assertive campaign to police discourse about its policies, even outside of its borders, and the acquiescence of American companies eager to make money in China, pose a dangerous and growing threat to one of this nation\u2019s core values: the freedom of expression,\u201d the paper wrote this week. Now maybe the Times can turn to the dangerous and growing threat to that core value of freedom of expression that\u2019s found on our own country\u2019s leftist-dominated college campuses.\n\nRemarkable how it takes a juicy temptation to attack capitalists \u2013 \u201cAmerican companies eager to make money in China\u201d \u2013 to get the Gray Lady to sound a warning against communism. But the editorial does insightfully identify the most important difference between the U.S.-China conflict and the Cold War with the Soviet Union. \u201cThe United States and China are economically intertwined: The trade volume between the two countries is the greatest of any between two countries in the history of the world. \u2026 But far too many American companies have shown that their values are for sale.\u201d It cited the sad spectacle of foreign airlines kowtowing to Beijing\u2019s diktats and scrapping references to Taiwan from their websites, \u201cand Marriott firing a social media manager in Omaha for \u2018liking\u2019 a tweet posted by a group that backs Tibetan independence.\u201d\n\nThere has been plenty of naivete across the political spectrum in America on the expectation of China\u2019s embrace of a market economy inevitably leading to Chinese freedom, from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to Hillary Clinton, and of course including theorist Francis \u201cThe End of History\u201d Fukuyama, whose fond hope of \u201cthe end point of mankind\u2019s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government\u201d has aged very badly indeed.\n\nSome claim the Chinese threat is overblown. National University of Singapore professor and \u201cHas the West Lost It?\u201d author Kishore Mahbubani wrote in Harper\u2019s earlier this year that China as an adversary is manageable for the U.S. \u201cIf it agrees to be constrained by multiple global rules and partnerships, China could very well remain a different polity \u2014 that is, not a liberal democracy \u2014 and still not be a threatening one,\u201d according to Mahbubani. \u201cThis is the alternative scenario that the \u2018China threat\u2019 industry in the United States should consider and work toward.\u201d But that places a great amount of faith in paper promises.\n\nA cause for cheer is that Huawei\u2019s 5G technological superiority is actually more hype than reality, and countries and firms alike would be foolish to hitch their wagon to it for the long haul; the competition from other 5G companies such as Ericsson, Nokia, Qualcomm, and Samsung, rather than a Huawei monopoly, is the brighter global future for the new platform.\n\nSo the argument against Huawei and its communist masters is economic, as well as based on saving or enhancing political freedoms. Now it\u2019s up to the Trump administration, and 5G companies whose strings aren\u2019t pulled by expansionist tyrants, to spread the truth brought to life so well by \u201cClaws of the Red Dragon.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Written by Thomas McArdle\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
