The deal on the table would involve the drawing of a regulatory and customs border down the Irish Sea.\n\nDespite the last-minute threat to Downing Street\u2019s plans, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator told Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s team of commissioners on Wednesday morning that he believed a deal could be salvaged in the next few hours.\n\nA key meeting of EU ambassadors with Barnier that was set for 1pm London time was pushed back to 4pm to allow extra time for Johnson to win over the unionist party.\n\nAt the same time, the prime minister is expected to brief his cabinet on the situation before addressing a scheduled meeting of the 1922 Committee in the evening.\n\n\u201cWe are still waiting for a signal from across the Channel\u201d, said one EU diplomat. \u201cA lot of things are happening between the cabinet, DUP, and the hardest Brexiters.\u201d.\n\nQuick guide Why is the Irish border a stumbling block for Brexit? Show Hide Counties and customs Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.\n\nBritain\u2019s exit from the EU \u2013 taking Northern Ireland with it \u2013 risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety. The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals. There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer. Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts or cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland.

Sources in Berlin have suggested that process could take as long as two months.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that there can only be a political agreement tomorrow or Friday because we cannot see any text, we cannot say \u2018yes\u2019 without legal scrubbing\u201d, a diplomat said. \u201cWe need much more time.\u201d\n\nThe diplomat added that the leaders would require \u201cclarity from the House of Commons on Saturday because we\u2019ve had three deals before\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is the fourth time they want clarity from the UK side. We won\u2019t continue with legal scrubbing and translations to end up with something that is going to be voted down. There is a clear desire for an outcome in London that shows support,\u201d the diplomat added.\n\nUnder the deal being negotiated, Northern Ireland would not be part of the EU\u2019s customs territory, but the bloc\u2019s full customs code would have to be enforced in the Irish Sea.\n\n\u201cNorthern Ireland would de jure be in the UK\u2019s customs territory but de facto in the European Union\u2019s,\u201d one diplomatic source said of the tentative agreement.\n\nBeyond the DUP\u2019s issues with the deal, it is understood the talks between British and EU negotiators have run into trouble on the issue of level playing field guarantees.\n\nThe guarantees are promises to maintain EU standards in environment, tax and state aid to prevent Britain from undercutting the EU for a competitive advantage.\n\nThe guarantees are part of the political declaration agreed by Theresa May, which sets out the broad terms for future free trade agreement talks, but Johnson\u2019s chief adviser has sought to have the reference removed from the text.\n\nA diplomat said EU leaders would not agree to the revised withdrawal agreement separately to the political declaration.", "description": "Boris Johnson fighting to get Democratic Unionists to back Brexit deal with Brussels", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcd51fd13608fa46c875110e8b6dae9ff3d515d1/4_231_1801_1081/master/1801.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c9bed83fa0dfc3cab463be1a3a79e70d", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
