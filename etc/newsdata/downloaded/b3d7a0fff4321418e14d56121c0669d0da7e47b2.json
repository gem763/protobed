I said I was here to film this action. Several individuals grabbed me and pulled me on the floor and about 20 Londoners beat me down,\u201d Laughlin said.\n\nHe said he remained \u201cin a foetal position being kicked\u201d before three Londoners jumped in and covered him to shield him from the blows.\n\nA separate protest saw two priests climb atop a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) train and read an impromptu prayer vigil at the Shadwell stop just east of the City of London financial hub.\n\nA third protest member glued himself to the train.\n\nService along both lines was halted during the morning commute. The disruptions sparked a social media backlash and drew angry headlines in the tabloid press.\n\n\u201cMuppets!\u201d the mass-circulated Sun newspaper fumed.\n\nExtinction Rebellion issued a carefully worded statement several hours later that did not explicitly apologise but did express regret.\n\n\u201cIt is regretful that there was violence at today\u2019s action at Canning Town tube station. We would like to express our sadness that events escalated this way.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Internal splits \u2013\n\nLondon police have reported making more than 1,600 arrests since activists first took to the streets at the start of last week.\n\nThe campaign has seen activists try to \u201coccupy\u201d London City Airport and other sites in and around the UK capital\u2019s two vibrant financial districts.\n\nThe group accuses big businesses and the government of inaction in the face of fast-rising global temperatures that scientists link to polluting carbon emissions.\n\nBut the rumbles of Londoners\u2019 discontent have been growing and police imposed a blanket ban on gatherings of more than two people at the start of the week.\n\nCampaigners on Thursday were refused an urgent High Court hearing to challenge what they called an \u201cunprecedented and disproportionate\u201d ban.\n\nAnger at the disruption appeared to reach boiling point with the Canning Town incident, prompting Extinction Rebellion to acknowledge the backlash and promise a change of tack.\n\n\u201cIn light of today\u2019s events, Extinction Rebellion will be looking at ways to bring people together rather than create an unnecessary division,\u201d the group\u2019s statement said.\n\nIt also hinted at disagreements over tactics within its ranks.\n\n\u201cWe are a broad and diverse movement with a wide range of views, and are aware that many people were not for this action,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThose that acted this morning planned their action autonomously, within Extinction Rebellion\u2019s principles and values.\u201d\n\nThe group briefly splintered when it refused to sanction an attempted drone attack on London\u2019s Heathrow Airport last month.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 British environmental campaigners expressed regret Thursday and promised to change their ways after one of their protests caused a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/0c3a55_london-metropolitan-police-arrested-600-protesters-group-autumn-uprising-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
