The calendared film and adhesive system allow the installer to remove the graphic, snap it up and reposition without stretching or distortion. The air egress liner reduces air entrapment and makes bubble removal easy.\n\nFLEXcon\u00ae HX5000 conforms to flat, simple and compound curved and non-riveted surfaces. It is printable via UV and solvent inkjet, UV and solvent screen, and is HP Latex compatible. FLEXcon\u00ae HX5000 is designed to be overlaminated with FLEXcon\u00ae BUSart\u2122 OV5055 (2 mil clear cast vinyl) which provides protection of graphics against abrasion and bus/train cleaning. The combination of the calendared vinyl and cast overlaminate ensures removal of the graphics without tearing, making campaign changeovers a breeze. See a demo at Printing United, Booth #8024.\n\n\u201cThe adhesive system is light to the touch and prevents it from grabbing the surface. Large-format panels can even be overlapped \u2014 snapped up and repositioned until the graphic is in the right place \u2014 making installs faster and easier without sacrificing quality,\u201d said Jodi Sawyer, Market Development Manager at FLEXcon.\n\nAbout FLEXcon\n\nFLEXcon Company, Inc. is a global leader in coated and laminated films and adhesives used in graphics applications, manufactured goods, and new products.
