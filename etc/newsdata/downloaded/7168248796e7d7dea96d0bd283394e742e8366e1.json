Footage from WSVN-TV shows the Balearia Caribbean ship traveling to Fort Lauderdale on Sunday with a loudspeaker message saying passengers who didn\u2019t have a U.S. visa needed to disembark.\n\nBahamians need a visa to travel to the U.S. unless they are prescreened by U.S. customs officers at one of the two main Bahamian airports. The U.S. agency also can arrange special prescreening for passengers departing from ports. However, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio says Balearia Caribbean decided to depart Sunday instead of waiting for the prescreening.\n\nRubio and Florida\u2019s other U.S. senator, Rick Scott, have asked President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to waive visa requirements altogether for Bahamian storm victims with relatives in the U.S., but Trump indicated Monday that he wants to keep stringent vetting in place in part because of \u201cpeople going to the Bahamas that weren\u2019t supposed to be there.\u201d\n\nThe Spanish ferry company apologized Monday to the 119 passengers who could not be taken to Fort Lauderdale. In the footage, passengers could be seen walking along the aisles - some carrying young children - to leave the ferry after they had already boarded the ship.\n\nIn a statement, spokeswoman Pilar Boix said the ferry allowed passengers to embark thinking they didn\u2019t need visas.\n\n\u201cThe shipping company later received indications that in order to travel to the U.S., the passengers would need pre-clearance authorization in person at the immigration offices in Nassau,\u201d Boix said in an email.\n\nA day before the port incident, hundreds of Bahamians had arrived to Florida on a cruise ship that Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line had offered at no cost. CBP says 857 Bahamians were properly screened and arrived to the Port of Palm Beach \u201cwithout incident.\u201d\n\nThe company said in a statement Monday that the operators spent nearly a full day going through the vetting process with U.S. officials on the ground in Freeport. About one-fifth of the passengers had to show a police report along with a birth certificate, the company said.\n\nFlorida state Rep. Shevrin Jones, of Bahamian ancestry, had asked Rubio and Scott for help asking the Trump administration to waive visa requirements. Jones said what happened at the boat was a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d between ferry administrators and U.S. agencies but said the government needs to make the process easier on families fleeing the devastated islands.\n\n\u201cI hope that they look at this as a humanitarian issue,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThis needs to happen now. The longer we wait, the more lives will be lost.\u201d\n\nTrump gave no indication Monday that he is considering lifting requirements for Bahamians. Trump said vetting should continue for those traveling to the U.S. and said people from the affected islands could instead be taken to other Bahamian regions not hit by Dorian.\n\n\u201cWe have to be very careful. Everybody needs totally proper documentation,\u201d Trump said before he flew to North Carolina to inspect hurricane damage and speak at a political rally. \u201cI don\u2019t want to allow people that weren\u2019t supposed to be in the Bahamas to come into the United States, including some very bad people and some very bad gang members and some very, very bad drug dealers.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Writer Kevin Freking contributed to this story from Washington.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "More than 100 Bahamians who hoped to evacuate to Florida after Hurricane Dorian but didn't have visas were kicked off a ferry because operators failed to coordinate the mission with authorities, officials said Monday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Adriana Gomez Licon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/bahamas_destroyed_by_dorian_59996_c0-95-3800-2310_s1770x1032.jpg?59e5143ec0dccd7e5f8c86f629b79d7bf47b7958", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
