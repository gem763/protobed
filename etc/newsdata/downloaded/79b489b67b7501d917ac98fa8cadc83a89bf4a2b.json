He\u2019s scored five goals, one every two games, for a 19-year-old kid who\u2019s never played men\u2019s football before, he\u2019ll surprise anyone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I think he\u2019s even surprised Chelsea. I don\u2019t think they knew how far he could go so soon.\n\n\u2018They had people come in on Thursday. Claude Makelele (technical mentor at Chelsea) came in to speak to us about the loan, how Conor is getting on, their thoughts on him and they\u2019re delighted.\n\n\u2018Conor is a good player, one to watch in the future.\u2019\n\nDuring the international break, Gallagher will join up with the England U21 squad after being promoted from the U20s.\n\nThe talented midfielder has spoken highly of Charlton boss Bowyer, who led the Addicks to promotion in League One last season.\n\nChelsea hero Claude Makelele is keeping close tabs on Gallagher (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018He\u2019s great. I\u2019ve only worked under him for a couple of months now but I\u2019ve loved it,\u2019 Gallagher said.\n\n\u2018He was a midfielder back in the day and knows his stuff. He has played at the top level so it\u2019s a lot to learn to make the box every time and that is how I\u2019ve scored my goals this season.\n\n\u2018I am looking forward to working under him for the end of the season.\u2019\n\nMORE: Shkodran Mustafi reacts to being voted world\u2019s second worst defender behind Phil Jones", "description": "Chelsea and Claude Makelele are 'delighted' and 'surprised' by the development of loan star Conor Gallagher, according to Charlton boss Lee Bowyer.
