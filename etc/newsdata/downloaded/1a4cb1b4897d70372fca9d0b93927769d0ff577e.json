Richard Nixon resigned before Congress could decide that he was, in fact, a crook, and both Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson were acquitted in their impeachment trials. Removal from office is hard to imagine because it has never happened.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nExcept that it has happened, to another real estate mogul turned politician with improper ties to foreign leaders. It\u2019s just that he was a senator, not a president.\n\nHis name was William Blount, born in 1749 to a wealthy family in North Carolina, one of the most corrupt parts of British North America. In 1776, Blount joined the patriot cause as paymaster for the new state. While handling large volumes of IOUs, many of them in the form of western lands promised to soldiers, he saw firsthand how those in power could profit from their duties.\n\nHe liked what he saw.\n\nWith independence won in 1783, most people in North Carolina wanted to make western lands available for poor settlers as well as patriotic veterans. But with so many groups \u2014 the Cherokee and Creek nations, the Continental Congress, the British, the Spanish, etc. \u2014 vying for the southern frontiers, no one knew how to claim those lands. Indeed, many settlers wanted to start a new state just west of North Carolina, where no one owned too many acres and people could pay their taxes in pelts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlount had other ideas.\n\nHis strategy was simple: Make up the names of hundreds of settlers and then snap up the best plots with these ghost entries at North Carolina\u2019s new land office, which opened in 1783. Then, he tried to raise land values by luring British investors with fairy tales of North America\u2019s emerging real estate markets. \u201cYou will necessarily keep up a Report of as many [settlers] being about to go [west] as you possibly can,\u201d he told one of his minions, \u201cwhether true or not.\u201d There were many shady speculators in post-Revolution America, but none as audacious as Blount.\n\nWith his associates, among them a young lawyer named Andrew Jackson, Blount eventually \u201cowned\u201d about 1 million acres, much of it deep inside Indian country. He used these claims to gain influence with both state and federal officials. In 1790, Blount became governor of the Southwest Territory (today\u2019s Tennessee), rejoicing to his brother that this post was \u201cof great Importance to our Western Speculations.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the face of constant invasion, several hundred Cherokees declared war on the Southwest Territory on Sept. 11, 1792. For the next two years, Blount begged U.S. officials for aid, but federal authorities were focused on Ohio, prompting Blount and his confidants to privately rage that the do-gooders in the nation\u2019s capital preferred \u201csavage\u201d friends to white families. So they took matters into their own hands, with Blount quietly instructing Jackson and other confidants to launch scorched-earth missions into Indian country.\n\nOf course, the administrations of George Washington and John Adams were no friends of any Indians, but they still required U.S. citizens to abide by solemn treaties, including a new one with the Cherokee in 1794. Blount was all for peace if it would improve land values, but this treaty blocked white settlers from further trespassing on Indian grounds, which meant they could not buy Blount\u2019s more remote claims.\n\nVastly in debt because of his high-flying speculations, Blount could not wait for federal officials to open more land for legal sale. So, in early 1797, he used his position as one of the first senators from Tennessee to approach British agents about invading the Spanish-held lands of the Gulf Coast. (Spain and Britain were then at war because of the French Revolution, while the United States clung to neutrality.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nApparently the idea was to create a new, pro-British province in what is now Louisiana, presumably with him as governor. That way he could give out more land to friends, relatives and himself. Besides Blount, the big winner would have been the young republic\u2019s most dangerous enemy: Great Britain.\n\nPresident Adams found out about these half-baked plans in a bombshell letter, which he showed to his wife, Abigail. \u201cHere is a diabolical plot,\u201d she wrote. The president also sent the evidence to the House of Representatives, which voted to impeach Blount \u201cfor high crimes and misdemeanors\u201d on July 7, 1797. The senators then used their removal powers from Article I, Section 5, to expel him from the chamber.\n\nThe next year, they drew up five articles of impeachment, each of which noted that Blount had acted \u201ccontrary to the duty of his trust and station\u201d and \u201cagainst the peace and interests\u201d of the United States.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe never faced the charges. Hiding from both Congress and his creditors, Blount lived out his days in Tennessee. (The frustrated senators dropped the case in 1799.) His half brother Willie went on to become governor, while his protege Jackson would go on to win the White House in 1828. In terms of land speculation and anti-Indian violence, William Blount was simply ahead of his time.\n\nAnd yet Congress had done its duty by calling out a man of no evident scruple, a man who tried to erase the line \u2014 blurry as it may be \u2014 between public service and private interest. In so doing, the congressmen honored both the letter and the spirit of the Constitution, in which impeachment is a real thing, a grave but viable option in the face of clear and present danger.\n\nAD", "description": "No sitting president has ever been thrown out by impeachment, but there are other examples of officials being removed from office.", "authors": ["J.M.
