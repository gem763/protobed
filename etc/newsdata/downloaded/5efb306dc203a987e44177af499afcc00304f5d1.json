But Afua Hirsch, a jury member, wrote an article yesterday saying that the decision had been made difficult because they had to \"judge the titanic career, the contribution to culture of Margaret Atwood\" against the others.\n\nThat admission provoked a furious response from Sam Jordison, whose tiny publishing house, Galley Beggar Press, is home to Lucy Ellmann, shortlisted for her 1,000-page opus, Ducks, Newburyport.\n\n\u201cWe were led to believe it was a book prize, not a career prize. This is devastating to read. Why enter?\u201d Jordison wrote on social media. \u201cIn what way is this fair?\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cLucy went through so much, worked so hard, went to so many events. We have spent thousands of pounds that we don\u2019t have. And we never had a hope from the start. Why did we even send them copies of the book to read? I am shaking.\u201d", "description": "The publisher of one of this year\u2019s Booker Prize nominees has criticised the judging process after a jury member appeared to admit that the award was shared with Margaret Atwood to honour her \"titanic career\".", "authors": ["Anita Singh", "Allister Heath", "Sherelle Jacobs", "Stephen Bush"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000213118608-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqC9PogZUtSpqAqO-tnweStQt3tN9Ddv3cHZNIEmYP14g.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
