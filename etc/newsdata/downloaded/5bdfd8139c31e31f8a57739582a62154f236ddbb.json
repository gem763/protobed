And yet, it has no weapon at its disposal to defend itself during such an assault by this enemy.\u201c\n\nHe said people on nearby Great Bahama island are in serious distress and that rescue crews would respond once weather conditions permitted them to do so.\n\n\u201cThis is the time for us as Bahamians to show our love, our care and our compassion,\u201d Mr Minnis said.\n\n\u201cYour compassion at this most difficult hour will bring healing and hope to those who are traumatised by this destructive hurricane.\u201d\n\nAs officials in the Bahamas urged residents to find flotation devices and use hammers to break out of their attics if they were threatened by the massive flooding, Mr Trump spent part of the day at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia. Reports said it was the 289th day he has spent at a Trump property and the 227th he has enjoyed at one of his golf clubs since becoming president.\n\n\u201cOur real opponent is not the Democrats, or the dwindling number of Republicans that lost their way and got left behind, our primary opponent is the Fake News Media,\u201d he tweeted before leaving the White House.\n\n\u201cIn the history of our country, they have never been so bad.\u201d\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6082331952001\n\n\u2018It is a very, very powerful hurricane\u2019 Donald Trump says incoming hurricane Dorian is \u2018a problem\u2019\n\nExperts said that Dorian had slowed to as little as 1mph, and was pummelling the Bahamas with heavy rain and powerful winds, even though it had been downgraded one notch to a category 4 storm, which meant it was bearing sustained winds of 233 kph (145mph).\n\n\u201cDevastating winds and storms surge will continue to affect Grand Bahama through tonight,\u201d the US\u2019s National Hurricane Centre said in an update on Monday evening. \u201cEveryone there should remain in shelter and not venture into the eye.\u201d\n\nAs many as 13,000 homes in the Bahamas may have been destroyed or severely damaged, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said. Houses in a neighbourhood in Freeport on Grand Bahama Island were engulfed by six feet of water. \u201cIt looks like they\u2019re boats on top of the water,\u201d said Rosa Knowles-Bain, 61, a resident who fled two days ago to an emergency shelter.\n\nSpotted by eagle-eyed photojournalist @abdallahcnn: Trump golfing at his Virginia golf club moments ago pic.twitter.com/0DwVtGmvGN \u2014 Jeremy Diamond (@JDiamond1) September 2, 2019\n\nDorian was expected to drift to the northwest late on Tuesday and will trawl long the coasts of Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. \u201cLife-threatening\u201d storm surges and hurricane-like winds have been forecast for all three states.\n\nReports said strong and high surf were already being reported along Florida\u2019s east coast as the hurricane was about 168km (105 miles) from West Palm Beach.\n\nAt the White House, staff members reviewed hurricane planning with state and local officials. Mr Trump was being briefed hourly, White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said.\n\nNine counties in Florida have issued mandatory evacuations. These included for parts of Duval County, home to Jacksonville, one of Florida\u2019s two biggest cities, and some areas in Palm Beach County, home to Mr Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nFlorida governor Ron DeSantis urged coastal residents to heed evacuation orders. \u201cGet out now while there\u2019s time and while you have fuel available,\u201d he said from the state\u2019s emergency operations centre in Tallahassee.\n\nAmong those being evacuated was Sue Watson, a 93-year-old resident of a retirement community in Kissimmee in central Florida.\n\n\u201cI was all set to stay home until they had to turn the water off,\u201d said Ms Watson, who added that she was not worried for her personal safety but hoped the storm spared the retirement community.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies\n\nRead more\n\nMilitary fly through Hurricane Dorian in dramatic video\n\nTrump incorrectly states hurricane will hit Alabama\n\nEvacuations underway in three US states as record storm hits Bahamas\n\n\u2018Huge damage\u2019 in Bahamas as Dorian matches record for strongest storm", "description": "Five people have been killed by Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas, the nation\u2019s prime minister has revealed, as Donald Trump spent part of the day playing golf.As the Category 4 storm pummelled the Bahamas with 233kph (145mph) winds, triggering huge damage and massive flooding, Hubert Minnis said at least", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UsnVVJ.F1WWrps7WAsv3ZA--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/65302262b7ea1f27eaed54168fbd93f4"}
