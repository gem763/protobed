After a couple of modest face-lifts the second generation went on sale from 2011.\n\nBut the third generation is a more significant departure \u2013 on looks alone you can see at a glance it is lower, sleeker, more streamlined, and the weight of an average man (around 80kg) lighter.\n\nIt was first unveiled at the Frankfurt motor Show, in September, where the significantly streamlined body, slimmed down face and re-worked rear became instantly apparent.\n\nIt takes its exterior cues from the aviation fuselages of vintage planes from the 1930s with concave and convex shapes. Think of the machines Leonardo de Caprio was flying when he played tycoon Howard Hughes in the movie The Aviator.\n\nWith a price-tag starting from \u00a3159,100, it is designed, engineered, hand-crafted and built in Britain at the firm\u2019s factory in Crewe, which employs 4,000 people.\n\nSo important is the car to Bentley that they actually delayed the planned driving launch by a few months until now to tweak the computer software that controls the eight-speed automatic gearbox because the gear changes weren\u2019t smooth enough.\n\nA limited run of First Editions. carrying a Union flag and a hefty mark-up will signal first deliveries this summer. Bentley say the UK is sold out for a year. The US will be a huge market, as will China.\n\nWith a price-tag starting from \u00a3159,100, the 2018 Continental GT is designed, engineered, hand-crafted and built in Britain at Bentley\u2019s 4,000-employee strong factory in Crewe\n\nThe latest Bentley to hit the maket takes its exterior cues from the aviation fuselages of vintage planes from the 1930s with concave and convex shapes\n\nFor a car of its size, Ray Massey said he found the steering and handling surprisingly light and responsive and not at all heavy\n\nWhat's the Bentley Continental GT like to drive?\n\nBentley Continental GT: Will it fit in my garage? Price: From \u00a3159,100 Built: Crewe, England On sale: Now Length: 4850mm Width: 2187mm Height: 1405mm Weight: 2.244 tonnes Engine: 6.0 litre W12 turbo-charged TSI petrol Power: 635 PS (626bhp) Gears: 8-speed dual clutch automatic (with manual override) Drive: Active all-wheel drive Top speed: 207mph 0-62mph (100km/hr): 3.7 seconds Fuel efficiency: Average: 23.2mpg Urban: 16.0mpg Cruising: 31.7mpg CO2 emissions: 278g/km Wheels: 21 inch standard, 22 inch option\n\nLike the original 2003 launch version, it is a spiritual successor to Bentley\u2019s achingly gorgeous R-Type Continental of 1952 in which you can imagine Grace Kelly and Cary Grant gliding down to Monte Carlo and Nice.\n\nSo what\u2019s it like to actually drive?\n\nGreat fun \u2013 on many levels. And surprisingly practical too for everyday use.\n\nFire it up and there\u2019s a reassuring but still rather refined Bentley roar.\n\nFor a car of its size I found the steering and handling surprisingly light and responsive \u2013 not at all heavy.\n\nAnd like a very good actor it can play many characters.\n\nThat\u2019s thanks in part to three main drive settings: Comfort for everyday driving, Bentley for long distance touring, and Sport for a more dynamic drive, plus a fourth for customising it for yourself.\n\nFancy a sports car? Put it into sports mode and you are away.\n\nThere is a welcome rush of controlled power but smoothly and seamlessly so. This is no brute. It is well honed athlete with balance poise and agility.\n\nNavigating the hairpin bends of the Grossglockner pass, rising to a height of 2,504m making it the highest road in Austria, was a doddle as the GT swung elegantly around the tightest of curves before, at the press of the accelerator, roaring off into the mountains.\n\nBrakes are suitably firm and secure and are the most powerful system ever fitted to a Bentley, with a total of 28 pistons.\n\nRay Massey pictured at the wheel of the new Bentley. As you can see, the interior has a wealth of technology with digital screens in the dash and replacing the instrument cluster\n\nRay started the day with breakfast in Austria before crossing the border to Italy for a pasta lunch\n\nBy sunset, Ray Massey was back in Austria just in time for wiener schnitzel for dinner\n\nIt\u2019s even well-mannered in sport mode through towns and villages. But if you just want to amble around, then comfort mode will keep you relaxed and chilled. The Bentley mode is a good compromise between the two.\n\nBeating at its heart is a powerful and enhanced 6.0-litre W12 turbo-charged petrol engine developing 626 brake-horsepower and linked to a slick new eight-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox.\n\nYou can sense the power about to be unleashed you press the accelerator, speeding it from rest to 60mph in just 3.6 seconds \u2013 0.7 seconds faster than its predecessor. Often I ran out of road before feeling the full effect.\n\nThe 207 top speed is 9mph faster than the outgoing car and more than adequate for derestricted German autobahns, but even a dab of that throttle is a threat to your licence if you try this back in Blighty.\n\nHowever, despite improvements to fuel efficiency \u2013 it averages 23.2mpg compared to 19.9mpg for the previous model \u2013 it\u2019s still a gas-guzzler.\n\nCO2 emissions are a hefty 278g/km despite a 16 per cent improvement helped by the reduced weight and start-stop technology that cuts out the engine at idle.\n\nThe back seats can be a little cramped for adults but should be adequate for families with young children\n\nInside the Bentley is luxurious and comfortable with lots of small details adding to the feel\n\nThe driver can tailor the screen behind the steering wheel to show what they want to see\n\nWhat's the Continental GT like inside?\n\nBentley are rightly proud of what it says is the most hi-tech car it has ever launched, with the world\u2019s first three-way rotating dashboard that takes its inspiration from James Bond\u2019s famous revolving number plate.\n\nThe clever triangular Toblerone-style device has three different dashboard faces, and the driver can choose which one to view.\n\nAt first glance the fascia of the sporty new Bentley Continental GT displays a clear smooth wood veneer. But fire up the engine and the middle of the dashboard glides silently forward and rotates to reveal a 12.3-inch display screen with three windows for navigation, telephone and general media.\n\nAt the flick of a switch, the driver can spin it again to reveal a third face \u2013 showing three analogue dials displaying outside temperature, a compass and a chronometer.\n\nIt is inspired by the rotating number-plate gadget used in the James Bond movie Goldfinger on 007\u2019s gadget-laden Aston Martin DB5.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a The clever triangular Toblerone-style device has three different dashboard faces, and the driver can choose which one to view. At first it appears to be a plain piece of veneer but then it moves round to reveal the touchscreen display\n\nThe interior resembles a snug cockpit with a design that's reminiscent of art deco aviation\n\nIt is the most technologically advanced Bentley ever produced \u2013 with 2,300 circuit boards, five miles of wiring, 92 electronic control units and controlled by 100 million lines of computer code (15 times more than on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner)\n\nThe rest of the interior resembles a snug cockpit with a design that's reminiscent of art deco aviation styling.\n\nEach individual interior is crafted from nine northern European bull hides stitched together with 1.7 miles of thread. The leather is shaved to just 1mm thickness to save weight. Diamond-style patterning on-seat embroidery includes 712 stitches per diamond shape, totalling more than 310,000 stitches per car.\n\nEach luxury handcrafted cabin has 10 square metres of veneer wood that takes nine hours to create and fit.\n\nWhile you can definitely enjoy the engine roar of the 6.-0-litre motor, drivers won't have to hear the awful sound of tyre rumble. That's because the special Pirelli P Zero tyres have a noise cancelling system which reduces road noise coming into the cabin.\n\nThere are 17 basic exterior paint options - including this Orange Flame - plus 70 in extended range\n\nRay said the Bentley Continental GT isn't completely faultless. The A-pillars splitting the windscreen and front side windows are so thick that it's difficult to see around them at junctions\n\nThe Daily Mail's Motoring Editor also didn't like the flimsy feel of some of the controls in the cockpit\n\nBut it's not an entirely glowing report on first impressions as there are a couple of slight niggles.\n\nThe windscreen pillars are quite thick, for safety reasons, which can obscure vision when turning the tightest corners.\n\nAnd the indicator and other stalks feel a bit lightweight and blingy \u2013 out of keeping with the solid feel of the rest of the car.\n\nTo prove its grand touring credentials, it has been tested over more than 600,000 miles around the globe in temperatures from sub-zero to 50C.\n\nThis was from the Middle East and South Africa to the America and China \u2013 and even on a special piece of potholed road near the firm\u2019s Pym\u2019s Lane factory, which Bentley persuaded the local council to leave unrepaired because it gives such a good real-world experience of wear and tear on UK highways.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to take it on tour of the UK \u2013 from Land\u2019s End to John O\u2019Groats.
