Not to mention the fact that it\u2019s been an extremely successful export.\n\nFirefly (2002)\n\n\u2018The greatest cultural artefact humanity has ever produced\u2019: Stephen, 63, Ipswich\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest How could anyone resist? ... Firefly. Photograph: Fox/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar\n\n\n\nCombining the best of Deadwood, Black Mirror and Star Trek, Firefly, as well as being the greatest TV show of any era, may claim to be the greatest cultural artefact humanity has ever produced. Joss Whedon never wrote better, its stars never appeared in anything better, there never was anything better. Cowboys in space \u2013 how could anyone resist?\n\nBattlestar Galactica (2004-09)\n\n\u2018This show was so good\u2019: AllergicToTrolls\n\nI can remember critics singing the usual praises of this being \u201cthe best TV show ever\u201d for a few years? Remember the hype around The Final Five? Everybody seemed to be on tenterhooks to find out who the disguised Cylons were. This show was so good.\n\nMoney Heist (2017-)\n\n\u2018Rarely a dull moment\u2019: sparky36\n\nI\u2019d like to have seen the Spanish language La Casa de Papel (Money Heist) in the list. The series is a tense, intricately plotted drama that combines police procedural, melodrama and heist movie with rarely a dull moment in any episode without ever outfoxing its own logic. Its strength rests entirely in the attention the showrunner has given to establishing meaningful relationships between the criminals and the audience \u2013 for me, the charismatic Berlin steals the show with his sophisticated malevolence. The first two series are its likely high watermark, and it would be entirely deserving of a wider viewership in the English speaking world.\n\nBroken (2017)\n\n\u2018Made a tough old broad like me cry\u2019: grumpyoldgirl\n\nEven if only for Sean Bean\u2019s spine-tinglingly superb acting, Broken was a brilliant serial. Each character was clearly defined and deeply human. It was impossible not to sympathise with the dilemmas of the working-class characters, and it made even a tough old broad like me cry, and the ending was deeply moving. This should have featured in this list, right at the top.\n\nPerson of Interest (2011-16)\n\n\u2018Lots of gutwrenching moments\u2019: MomentaryClarity\n\nIt started out looking as if it was a slight twist on The Equalizer but it quickly became apparent it was much, much more, exploring issues of free will, morality, ethics in politics, intelligence services and technology, political expediency, possible consequences of strong general AI etc. Brilliant performances from a very strong cast with lots of gutwrenching moments.\n\nRome (2005-07)\n\n\u2018It started it all\u2019: tenientesnafu\n\nThough short-lived, it started it all. Rome defined all the hallmarks of a good contemporary TV show: high value production, elaborate settings, excellent cast, good story, top-notch writing and cinematography. It also created kind of a \u2018default cast\u2019 for high-quality TV shows: superb actors that are recognisable but never hijack their roles.\n\nPeter Kay\u2019s Phoenix Nights (2001-02)\n\n\u2018It made me laugh very loudly\u2019: FlightGuileAndPies\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Dafted up\u2019 ... Peter Kay\u2019s Phoenix Nights. Photograph: Channel 4\n\nIt\u2019s probably very unfashionable to say that Phoenix Nights is one of my favourite programmes of the last 20 years, but it made me laugh very loudly and was very gentle and loving and warm. Some of the humour was a bit unreconstructed, but it was a reflection on real working-class attitudes and life, albeit \u201cdafted up\u201d.\n\nAvatar: The Last Airbender\n\n\u2018Really impressive TV-budget animation\u2019: VariousThings\n\nSeriously. Yeah it\u2019s, you know, for kids, but it stands up to anything on the list. It does so many things superbly well, such as: consistent, believable fantasy world-building with great attention to detail; sympathetic villains with extremely effective long-term redemption arcs; moments of really impressive TV-budget animation; and great voice acting, from both the adults (Mako!) and the child actors. Also it has Toph Beifong, the best character in anything ever.\n\nLast Week Tonight with John Oliver\n\n\u2018Very funny but fearless\u2019: Johnnybi\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Astonishing ... Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. Photograph: HBO\n\nLast Week Tonight with John Oliver really should go on any best 100 series \u2013 very funny but fearless and very informative, often about subjects that aren\u2019t normally covered in depth by serious television news, such as one fascinating piece on how US immigration works in practice. It\u2019s astonishing how much they cram into half an hour.\n\nChernobyl (2019)\n\n\u2018Beautifully shot and superb performances\u2019: RadioPartizan\n\nA brilliantly realised drama combining taut investigative thriller, edge-of-the-seat tension, desperate heroism and a powerful denunciation of a secretive, authoritarian society. All the more effective because of its commitment to the real-life events and its understated approach. Beautifully shot and superb performances too. Should be in anybody\u2019s top 10.\n\nMortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Fishing (2018)\n\n\u2018A gentle and warming exploration of mortality\u2019: Gary Bowden, 55, Newcastle upon Tyne\n\nA programme about fishing in some beautiful river locations across the UK, but really about the longstanding friendship of two ageing comedians who have had major life-saving surgery. A gentle and heartwarming exploration of mortality, friendship, empathy and humanity with added laughs, tears and Bob Mortimer\u2019s \u201cheart healthy\u201d cookery.", "description": "The Shelbys in Birmingham, a spine-tingling Sean Bean, cowboys in space ... here are Guardian readers\u2019 top shows of the century so far", "authors": ["Guardian Readers", "Rachel Obordo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0deb7b3a5181882352f5cecd172b982dd57d6eac/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=579ebcf6e5b2ab7f56081c8108279cf8", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
