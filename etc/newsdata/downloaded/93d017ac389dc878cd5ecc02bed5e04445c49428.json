The arena has been home to Wing Bowl, Gritty, indoor football, a Royal Rumble and a Republican national convention.\n\nBut never an NBA or NHL champion.\n\nSo it\u2019s little wonder Flyers fans need to let off some steam and go crazy in a \u201csecret\u201d room nestled in the upper level for fans in the new $25 standing-room-only section. The franchise that once satiated fans with the bloodlust of the Broad Street Bullies during the glory years of their 1974 and 1975 Stanley Cup championships has gone from \u201cThe Hammer\u201d to sledgehammers to let fans take their whacks inside a dorm-sized room.\n\n\u201cThe concept is definitely one-of-a-kind and non-traditional,\u201d Flyers executive Valerie Camillo said. \u201cWe ran the concept by some of our fans who told us they thought this would be a fresh way to have some harmless fun.\u201d\n\nThe Flyers charge $35 per person or $60 for two for five-minute rage sessions and will let up to 14 fans per game try their best at high-sticking. There are both online reservations and walk-up slots available. There are no current plans to open the room for 76ers games or other events. The room is accessible through a \u201cbookcase\u201d straight out of Wayne Manor and, like Batman, fans change into their rage room costume of jumpsuit and safety helmet.\n\nThe first Flyers fan to give it a (slap) shot was Peter Caccioppoli, of New York. He swung a hockey stick at a place setting that would make Martha Stewart wince and later took aim on a fishbowl which had the \u201cNJ\u201d Devils logo.\n\nCaccioppoli said he\u2019s been a partial season ticket holder \u201cfor a very frustrating five years,\u201d and was thrilled to take part in the demolition derby.\n\n\u201cI broke the stick, which was a lot of fun,\u201d Caccioppoli said. \u201cThe bat is easy to wield. I played baseball for a long time, so it was easy to throw a couple of plates and smash those. The sledgehammer was fun, too. It was a good time.\u201d\n\nThe Flyers introduced their googly-eyed mascot Gritty last season and the Comcast Spectacor ownership group has about turned the arena into a sports book this season with betting lines bombarding the new big screen for the opener. The Flyers struggled to draw consistent packed crowds last season as they missed the playoffs for the fourth time in seven seasons. They haven\u2019t made it to the second round since 2012 and will hit 10 years this season since their last Stanley Cup Final appearance.\n\nIf losing doesn\u2019t agitate fans enough, they can rage against the obscene - a 24 oz. beer can cost $14.50, a jumbo hot dog is $6 and a plant-based burger hits 13 bucks.\n\nThe Eagles once sent rowdy fans to a small jail inside since-demolished Veterans Stadium as a way to curb boorish behavior . Now, the Flyers want you to come up and face off for fun against the glass - a reason to go wild as the home team tries to break a championship drought.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Flyers have turned their fans into Raging Bullies.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dan Gelston"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/flyers_rage_room_hockey_48140_c0-1134-3024-2897_s1770x1032.jpg?6752e3c196bbb150f546f2a30d68210a166ccb5f", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
