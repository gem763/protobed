I used to lay my head down on the pillow and not open my eyes again until the morning, but now I find myself waking in the darkest morning hours and tossing and turning until I finally force myself out of bed and into my day. It leaves me miserable and barely able to function.\n\nPerimenopause meet puberty \u2014 my house is about to be a whole mess of hormones.\n\nWhen I talk to others in my age group, I realize that I\u2019m not alone. The word \"perimenopause\" is starting to be whispered around in those conversations. The first time I heard it, I gasped out loud. I searched for any other possible reason. Chin hairs are caused by stress, right? I can\u2019t possibly be entering menopause territory yet \u2014 I\u2019ve just gotten used to being in my forties.\n\nAs these next years go by, the symptoms will snowball and at some point over the next decade, I will be facing the big change of life.\n\nBut something tells me menopause won\u2019t be my biggest worry. Just as my body is starting to change in the most unpredictable ways, my kids will be facing their own unpredictable changes.\n\nPerimenopause meet puberty \u2014 my house is about to be a whole mess of hormones.\n\nIf my own teenage years are a sign of what I can expect, it\u2019s not going to be a walk in the park. I wasn\u2019t what I would refer to as a bad kid. I was always a rule follower, and while I pushed my boundaries a little and trouble might have found its way to me a few times, it was relatively tame.\n\nAnother Mom's POV On Perimenopause: Perimenopause And Parenting \u2014 Will It Kill Me? \u2018Cause It Feels Like It Will\n\nWhile my behaviour was subdued, my emotional stability during those years were not. I was moody and argumentative, and I thought I had the world figured out. I was full of eye rolls, tantrums and loud explosive arguments.\n\nI have a sinking feeling that my son is walking the same path. He\u2019s a good kid: he plays by the rules, he\u2019s kind and thoughtful, and he doesn\u2019t push the limits yet. But I see that emotional struggle bubbling up. The eye-rolls aren\u2019t frequent, but they are there.\n\nI know what\u2019s coming.\n\nWhen you think of the most emotionally unstable times in your life there are typically three periods that come to mind; toddler years, teenage years and menopause years. My house will be experiencing two of those simultaneously.\n\nOur family experiences big emotions as is. We feel with every ounce of our being. But what will that look like when at least two of us, most likely three, will be having a hard time regulating our emotions at the same time?\n\nMore From Natalie: I\u2019m Still A Struggling Mom Even Though My Kids Are Older\n\nI don\u2019t think my own mother faced this battle. By the time she would have hit her menopause years, I was off living on my own. I imagine this is a bigger issue today where many women are waiting to have their babies later in life. In those early baby years we are so caught up with getting pregnant, changing diapers and balancing a career with motherhood that we don\u2019t even think about what\u2019s to come.\n\nWe are both going to make mistakes throughout our lives, but that we can figure it out together.\n\nI\u2019m trying to prepare myself both mentally and physically. I\u2019m trying to make sure that we are all eating healthy, exercising and getting the right amount of sleep. While hormones really mess up the sleep part of it, keeping our bodies healthy can help.\n\nWe have already dabbled in the world of family therapy, so I know we have professionals that we can lean on if needs be.\n\nI take any chance I get to remind my kids that I love them and that we are all human. We are both going to make mistakes throughout our lives, but that we can figure it out together. Because I know that in the midst of it all, it\u2019s easy to forget that we\u2019re on the same team.\n\nI\u2019m preparing as much as I can.\n\nFull transparency: I\u2019m scared.\n\nYou'll Also Love: We\u2019re All Making Parenting Harder Than It Really Needs To Be\n\nI don\u2019t know if my emotionally fragile self is ready for my kid turning away from me.\n\nI will have to remind myself of what it\u2019s like to be a teenager. I will have to remember what it feels like to be uncomfortable in your own skin, to have no control over what\u2019s going on in your mind and body. I will have to remember just how hard it is to transition from child to adult. I will have to have patience.\n\nMost importantly, I will have to forgive myself. I know there are self-help books and parenting experts that will tell me the best way to deal with this double whammy of hormones is to keep my own emotions in check, to model the behaviour I want to see, but no one does it perfectly.\n\nOver the next few years I will expect a lot of door slamming, some tears and one too many sleepless nights. I\u2019m expecting a bit of a bumpy ride. Fingers crossed we both make it out the other side.", "description": "When you think of the most emotionally unstable times in your life there are typically three periods that come to mind; toddler years, teenage years and menopause years.
