I completed my audition in a packed coffee shop across the street instead.\n\nSituations like this \u2013 alongside the fact a three minute ad break can pass and not include one disabled actor \u2013 show how woefully the entertainment industry misunderstands the needs and importance of representation for disabled artists and audiences.\n\nThere are times, however, when the industry gets it right. The Peanut Butter Falcon, a film recently released in the UK, is just one of these instances.\n\nIt sees a young man with Down\u2019s syndrome in the lead role. Actor Zack Gottsagen plays Zak, who plans on making his dream to become a professional wrestler come true as he escapes from a care facility and runs away with a criminal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDescribed as a homage to Mark Twain, an innocently charming adventure film that will make you laugh.\n\nWhat we need is both representation on screen and for people with disabilities to feel included in the industry too\n\nIt\u2019s telling that leading learning disability charity Mencap are in full support of the film. The charity partnered with Signature Entertainment \u2013 the UK distribution company for the film \u2013 to help address the historic under-representation of people with a learning disability in the film industry, inviting film critics with learning disabilities to cover the UK premiere.\n\nOne critic who had a chance to interview the stars was Harry Roche. He said: \u2018Zack Gottsagen\u2019s character Zak will help change attitudes towards people with a learning disability in society, as well as kick-start conversations in the film industry about including people with a learning disability more often.\u2019\n\n\u2018Characters with a disability must be played by an actor with that disability, and that\u2019s why Zack\u2019s character is so important.\n\n\u2018For far too long, people with a learning disability have been largely invisible in film but Zack has shown that we can play these big parts and do it really well.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s vital that when we talk about disability and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 when we show disability we don\u2019t cherry pick what that looks like. With 13.9million disabled people in the UK, 1.5million of whom have a learning disability, we should be seeing better representation.\n\nAccording to recent research, in 900 popular movies between 2007 and 2016, only 2.7 per cent of speaking characters were depicted with a disability. And when it comes to the top prizes, 16 per cent of acting Oscars have gone to non-disabled actors playing disabled characters.\n\nI attended an audition once that specifically asked for a wheelchair user, yet when I arrived at the casting I realised they hadn\u2019t booked an accessible studio (Picture: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images)\n\nWhat we need is both representation on screen and for people with disabilities to feel included in the industry too. There is no point in having positive, authentic representation if those being represented don\u2019t feel safe in these spaces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile this could mean encouraging film critics with learning disabilities to review films, or more disabled actors taking lead roles, it could also be as easy as more inclusive cinema screenings.\n\nIt would be great if audiences were free to come and go as they please, all staff were trained to ensure that disabled viewers are comfortable throughout the film and that subtitles and hearing loops were implemented in more showings.\n\nUnfortunately I still see a whole lot of tokenism when we look at the entertainment industry. That is why I am so grateful for The Peanut Butter Falcon and Zack\u2019s character.\n\nThis is what it means to see a positive disabled role model on screen.\n\nIf the entertainment industry only knew what representation means to people like me and Mencap\u2019s film critics.\n\nIt drives us, inspires us and makes us feel like we belong.\n\nMORE: Girl designs Christmas cards to raise money for accessible room for disabled brother\n\nMORE: Are celebrities the best role models for the disabled community?
