He has wielded power in the Maryland Senate since before some current senators were born.\n\nAD\n\nHe said he will cede the presidency but intends to serve the remaining three years on his term as a rank-and-file senator. \u201cI don\u2019t intend to go cut the cord completely,\u201d he said in an phone interview from a hospital room earlier this week. The interview was embargoed until Miller announced his decision.\n\nAD\n\nSenate Democrats, who hold 32 of the chamber\u2019s 47 seats, voted in a closed-door caucus meeting Thursday to back Sen. Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) as Miller\u2019s successor.\n\nFerguson, 36, an attorney and former teacher who is a strong advocate of revamping and investing more in public education, had not yet entered kindergarten when Miller took control of the Senate.\n\nAD\n\nMiller shared his decision to step down with his Democrat colleagues at the caucus meeting held in the Miller Senate Office Building, which was dedidated to him 19 years ago.\n\nSince 1987, Miller, a devout Catholic, has been a larger-than-life figure in the Maryland General Assembly, known for his back-slapping charm and cunning as a political tactician. Most major policy decisions in the state \u2014 from casino gambling and tax structure to same-sex marriage and abortion rights \u2014 became law either through Miller\u2019s force or acquiescence.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe often says, \u2018I can\u2019t predict the future, but I\u2019m going to tell you what\u2019s going to happen\u2019,\u201d said Robert R. Neall, a longtime friend and former senator. \u201cBoth are true. He really doesn\u2019t predict the future, but he influences the future.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMiller announced in January he was undergoing chemotherapy for Stage IV prostate cancer that had metastized in his bones. He vowed to stay at the helm of the chamber as long as his health allowed.\n\nThis week, he spent four days at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore to be treated for complications of his cancer treatment.\n\nHe said his cancer has not worsened, but his weakened immunity and a string of complications starting in July \u2014 which include a bout of shingles and a broken rib and vertebrae from a fall \u2014 persuaded him he could not keep up the grueling schedule of a Senate president.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPhyiscally, I\u2019m fine. Mentally, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also time to move on. It\u2019s inevitable, so there\u2019s no better time than now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe said he still has enough energy to keep up with public events in his legislative district, but not those statewide.\n\n\u201cAnybody who follows me on Facebook knows that I keep up the regular daily schedule, going to events and responding constituent\u2019s problems and needs. And I enjoy that. That\u2019s an important part of my life,\u201d Miller said.\n\nHis resignation creates a leadership transition as Democratic lawmakers prepare to battle with Republican Gov. Larry Hogan over school funding. Miller said he plans to remain central in that fight, and intendes to spend the next year persuading Hogan to invest more in public schools.\n\n\u201cIt bothers me that [Maryland\u2019s] education is not No. 1 in the United States of America,\u201d Miller said.\n\nHogan and Miller sparred on policy during the governor\u2019s five-year tenure, but they also treated each other with affection and as worthy adversaries. As a teenager, Miller had worked for the governor\u2019s father, a former congressman and Prince George\u2019s County executive. Miller at one point babysat a 5-year-old Hogan while his dad was on the campaign trail.\n\nIn a statement, Hogan praised Miller as \u201ca strong, unifying leader for the legislature and the state. His steady presence and trademark humor will be deeply missed as President, but we are pleased to know that Mike will continue to represent Calvert County as he begins his 50th year in the Senate.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMiller, a history buff, has proven time and again to be a nimble leader who could steer the Senate through shifting political currents.\n\n\u201cMike could see things before they happened,\u201d said Vicki Grueber, his chief of staff for a third of his tenure. \u201cHe can see how things are going to go and how it\u2019s going to happen before it does. He was a student of history, and history repeats itself.\u201d\n\nAs the Senate grew younger and more liberal over the years, Miller survived a coup attempt in 2000. He cultivated influence by studying the lives and districts of his members, and his grip on power remained iron-clad.\n\nIn the earlier years, it was part through intimidation and salty temper. He once sent a menacing Christmas card to a lawmaker whose vote he disliked. Another time, he shoved a meddling lobbyist against a wall.\n\nIn later years, Miller\u2019s force was a more nuanced mix of fundraising prowess and political acumen. Among other tactics, he was a prolific donation bundler for his members. He was willing to ensure each of the 46 other Senators \u2014 the Republican minority included \u2014 could either take home a policy win to their districts or would not be forced into an untenable vote.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe enjoyed unshakeable loyalty from his colleagues, many of whom, as they watched his health degrade over the summer, believed he was in worse shape than he publicly revealed.\n\n\u201cHe loves what he does,\u201d said one veteran senator who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. \u201cLike in the old cowboys movies, he\u2019d probably decide to die in the saddle if it was up to him.\u201d\n\nThis winter, Miller announced that he would not seek reelection in 2022, at the end of his current Senate term. Already, The College of Southern Maryland announced the creation of the Thomas V. Mike Miller, Jr. Center for Leadership to honor him.\n\nMiller choked up five times during his 25-minute interview with The Post. He blamed a cancer treatment that starved his body of testosterone, joking that without it, he\u2019s a little more emotional than normal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith the extra time he\u2019ll get back by not doing building dedications and ribbon-cuttings around the state, \u201c hopefully, I will concentrate on my health,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI\u2019ll be like one of the other state senators, focusing on constituent service.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "One of Maryland\u2019s most colorful and powerful political figures will retain his senate seat but give up the gavel.", "authors": ["Erin Cox", "Local Reporter Covering Maryland State Politics", "Ovetta Wiggins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gVggfOXJtErFU-A6eNhl-cy2QUM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4B6CO7XWFII6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
