He\u2019d envisioned turning Vallecitos into a hot-spot for eco-tourism\u2014the town is nestled in an idyllic, wooded valley in the Sierra Madre del Sur\u2014and at the time he was killed he had several other development projects in the works. Now only this lonely hotel remains.\n\nIt\u2019s early fall and the rainy season is underway in these mountains. When the storms are too bad to go out I wander the deserted halls, the silent dining room. I look at the empty pool, study paintings of the slain owner\u2019s horses on the walls. All kept immaculate by the gerente, the caretaker, and his wife. The gerente went to school with the murdered owner and weeps to talk of him. The wife will not speak to me at all.\n\n\u201cWe keep hoping some day things will get better here,\u201d says gerente Jos\u00e9 Ramos, 46, while inspecting bullet holes in the hotel facade caused by a recent gun battle outside. \u201cIf the fighting ever stops, and the people come back, we want to be ready for them,\u201d Ramos tells me. \u201cThat\u2019s our dream.\u201d\n\nThe surrounding streets are almost as deserted as the hotel itself. Like many rural hamlets across Mexico, Vallecitos has become what\u2019s known as a pueblo fantasma. A ghost town. Shuttered shops. Bullet-riddled schools. Unstaffed clinics. The town\u2019s population has dwindled from a high of about 6,000 people a few years ago to around 700 today. And locals say those numbers are still falling, as residents flee cartel assaults and growing poverty.\n\n\u201c Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) is now the most powerful criminal organization in the country, with a confirmed presence in 22 Mexican states as well as the U.S., Central America, and South America. \u201d\n\nA study this year determined that Mexico was home to 1.13 million people displaced by violence. Guerrero, long among Mexico\u2019s most dangerous states and the nation\u2019s top heroin producer, is also a leader when it comes to internal refugees, many of whom flee north to seek asylum. The U.S. border patrol deports more residents from Guerrero than from anywhere else in Mexico.\n\nThere are two main factors driving the flow of refugees from small towns and villages like Vallecitos, and they are both tied to seismic changes in the cartel universe. The first has to do with an ongoing power struggle in the wake of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cChapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s capture and extradition to the U.S. The second is related to a profound shift in the habits of the cartels\u2019 best customers: American drug users.\n\nThese two key issues combined to push Mexico's homicide rate to historic levels this year. October has been marked by several major clashes, including one involving Chapo\u2019s son and another last week here in Guerrero that cost 15 lives. In all, some 17,000 people were killed in the first half of 2019, making this year the bloodiest in the 12-year history of the Drug War.\n\nTHE FALLEN\n\nTo better understand these changes, and how they impact communities, I\u2019ve sought out a mysterious man named Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Contreras, leader of the powerful Contreras clan, and the de facto authority in this lawless stretch of the sierra.\n\nSome townsfolk I\u2019ve spoken to claim Contreras is a freedom fighter, bravely resisting cartel incursions in order to protect his home. Other sources indicate he\u2019s the leader of a crime family that until recently enjoyed a near-monopoly on heroin production in these parts, enabled by the tacit support of local authorities. In fact, both versions of the story could be true, as Mexico\u2019s changing underworld landscape pits the old guard of quasi-paternal godfathers against the bloodthirsty new breed of narcos.\n\nContreras, 66, sits on the porch of his house at the center of town, not far from the Sierra Inn. He\u2019s soft-spoken and thoughtful. Almost dotingly polite. Dressed in a white cattleman\u2019s hat and a button-down shirt. He is not armed, but his brothers and sons and nephews drift in and out of the house toting G3s and AR15 assault rifles. One of the men wears a Kevlar vest that bears the insignia of the Mexican marines.\n\n\u201c Heroin use in the U.S. has fallen sharply as addicts turn to synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Opium prices have plummeted in Guerrero and the rest of Mexico, sometimes by as much as 90 percent. \u201d\n\nAs soon as we sit down it begins to rain again. The sound of the downpour hitting the porch roof is so loud it\u2019s impossible to converse. When the storm finally slacks off, Contreras leans in to speak:\n\n\u201cWe first began to hear of them in 2015,\u201d he says. \u201cAt that time we thought they were nothing. An upstart band of thieves. Stealing our cattle. Robbing our people. But when they killed my brother Ger\u00f3nimo [in 2017], we knew they were a real threat. That is when we began to confront them.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cthem\u201d he\u2019s referring is a well-connected gang of drug traffickers called the Cuernudos, so named for their members\u2019 affinity for the cuerno del chivo [horn of the goat] which is what the AK47 rifle is called in these parts because of its curved clip.\n\nThe Cuernudos, Contreras tells me, are a local cell of the larger Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), which has risen to prominence over the last few years, and is now the most powerful criminal organization in the country, with a confirmed presence in 22 Mexican states. The CJNG is also active in the U.S., Central America, and South America.\n\nBefore his downfall, Chapo Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s Sinaloa Cartel was so dominant it was able to maintain a so-called \u201cPax Mafioso\u201d in which other, smaller cartels were kept in line. After Chapo\u2019s arrest, the Sinaloa syndicate splintered, touching off a couple of years of brutal infighting to see who would emerge as the new top dog.\n\n\u201c Provincial factions like the Contreras family are forced to compete with the CJNG\u2019s sprawling, franchise approach. \u201d\n\nNow the dust seems to be settling. Chapo\u2019s old outfit has weakened considerably\u2014as evidenced by his son being easily found and temporarily detained a few days ago\u2014and it appears the CJNG behemoth has emerged victorious. Under brutal leader Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, aka \u201cEl Mencho,\u201d the CJNG has surpassed the Sinaloa Cartel and appears to be hell bent on taking over the rest of the country as well.\n\n\u201cMencho\u2019s current positioning at the top in the ongoing \u2018Narco Game of Thrones\u2019 in Mexico is due to a combination of luck, ruthlessness, timing, and organizational skills, as well as well-placed bribes to federal officials,\u201d says Robert Bunker, a professor at the Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army War College, in an email to The Daily Beast.\n\nJust last week, in the neighboring state of Michoac\u00e1n, Mencho\u2019s bunch showed just how ruthless and organized they can be by ambushing and killing 14 police officers, apparently because the cops had refused to take orders from the cartel.\n\nBunker describes the CJNG as having \u201cachieved dominance by being edgy, dangerous, and highly profitable\u201d and of \u201cbuilding out its presence through acquisitions of local criminal and drug gang cells as it franchises its operations throughout Mexico.\u201d\n\nProvincial factions like the Contreras family are forced to compete with the CJNG\u2019s sprawling, franchise approach, which includes providing gangs like the Cuernudos with funding and weapons in return for allegiance. It\u2019s not unlike corporate superstores overwhelming mom-and-pop shops in the States.\n\nContreras describes himself as the leader of an autodefensa (self-defense) militia, as opposed to a drug trafficker. Many of the locals I\u2019ve met also see him as a sort of Robin-Hood-like figure who aids the poor and staunchly suppresses crime in the region. But his sect has been unable to prevent the Cuernudos from killing and otherwise harassing citizens in and around Vallecitos. And that deadly violence is a major reason why so many residents have fled.\n\n\u201cThey are too powerful now,\u201d Contreras says of the Cuernudos. \u201cWe still hold the center of town but they control all the land outside. They own the roads. So we can\u2019t leave Vallecitos. We can\u2019t sell our products. It is like they\u2019re strangling us,\u201d he says. Even with his large extended family enlisted in the struggle, their fighting force is no match for the scores of sicarios the Cuernudos can deploy against them.\n\n\u201cI never thought my children would grow up to become prisoners in their own town,\u201d Contreras says.\n\nSURRENDER AND DIE\n\nIn addition to the charter-cell strategy, another factor that has allowed the CJNG to thrive and dominate has been its ability to take advantage of a rather sudden shift in Mexico\u2019s narco-economy.\n\nThe old-school dons first came to power as landed elites in Guerrero during the colonial era, raising, and sometime rustling, cattle and horses. Then came the heroin boom of the 1970\u2019s, which \u201cempowered local strongmen,\u201d according to Chris Kyle, an anthropologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Kyle describes the sierra around Vallecitos as Mexico\u2019s \u201cWild West.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost feudal up there,\u201d Kyle says in a phone interview. \u201cAnd so it was ready-made for opium production. Local criminals have always been present, but centralization [of the drug trade] was very rare.\u201d\n\nThat free-wheeling approach wasn\u2019t an issue while heroin prices were high, as groups like Sinaloa or the Beltran-Leyva Cartel paid as much as 20 thousand pesos [$1,040 USD] per kilo of opium gum\u2014the main ingredient in heroin\u2014to local suppliers.\n\n\u201c Due to its \u2018economies of scale and extensive networks\u2019 Mexico\u2019s new super cartel has \u2018a better chance to exploit the fentanyl market than smaller criminal players.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHowever, heroin use in the U.S. has fallen sharply of late, as addicts increasingly turn to synthetic opioids like fentanyl. The lack of demand is causing opium prices to plummet in Guerrero and the rest of Mexico, sometimes by as much as 90 percent. The sudden drop has undermined the revenue streams of smaller traffickers, while also destroying the livelihood of thousands of farmers who once eked out a living growing opium poppies.\n\nBunker calls the shift from naturally produced drugs to synthetics \u201chighly disruptive\u201d for rural communities, as many families once reliant on growing poppies have been \u201cforced to migrate to where they can find work.\u201d\n\nThe CJNG and its affiliates, on the other hand, have been able to take advantage of these changes to the black market. Due to its \u201ceconomies of scale and extensive networks\u201d Mexico\u2019s new super cartel has \u201ca better chance to exploit the fentanyl market than smaller criminal players,\u201d Bunker says.\n\nThe CJNG now controls several of the key Pacific ports where fentanyl and the precursor ingredients used to make it arrive from Asia. The next-gen narcos then funnel the chemicals up to their labs in the mountains of Michoac\u00e1n and Guerrero where they can be processed or blended with cheaply bought heroin.\n\nThis allows CJNG to make a profit while its competitors are being starved out. Fentanyl is faster to produce and far more potent\u2014and deadly\u2060\u2014than heroin. It\u2019s also easier to ship and smuggle across the U.S. border, and cartels can charge more for it, or even disguise it as legal opioids like Oxycontin.\n\nThese emerging trends \u201cmay well force the smaller players into other illicit activities such as extortion, kidnapping, gambling and prostitution, or even the body-parts trade,\u201d Bunker says. The also drive the forced displacement that is crippling rural communities like Vallecitos.\n\nBunker goes on to call the growing problem of internal refugees and ghost towns evidence of \u201clocalized state failure\u201d on the part of Mexican authorities in the face of a \u201ccriminal insurgency\u201d by the CJNG.\n\nMencho\u2019s insurgent network remains an existential threat to Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Contreras, be he a vigilante patriarch or a mafia capo. The last time I see him he\u2019s with some of his men on a hill overlooking the main road through town, taking advantage of a break in the rain to set up defensive breastworks against the next attack by the CJNG-allied Cuernudos.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to give up our homes, we\u2019ve shed too much blood to protect this land,\u201d Contreras says, but his voice is weary and he sounds every one of his 66 years. In addition to his brother, at least eight other family members have died in the ongoing turf war, including two more this month. He also knew the owner of the hotel where I\u2019ve been staying as the town\u2019s lone guest, and had backed his candidacy for mayor before he was murdered.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re totally isolated now. We can\u2019t surrender, because they\u2019ll kill us,\u201d Contreras says. \u201cBut we\u2019ll fight until the end.\u201d", "description": "The old guard is threatened, a new force is ascendant, and citizens increasingly are caught up in the violence.", "authors": ["Jeremy Kryt"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571530335/191020-kryt-mexico-cartel-hero_jmi2m8", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
