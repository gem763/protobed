(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nWhite House hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke escalated his feud with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) on Thursday night, asserting that his fellow Democrat has accomplished \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d on gun control.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments to reporters following a town hall in Aurora, Colo., came in response to Schumer distancing the party earlier this week from the former Texas congressman\u2019s call for a mandatory buyback program for assault-style weapons.\n\n\u201cAsk Chuck Schumer what he\u2019s been able to get done,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have [universal] background checks. Didn\u2019t have them when he was in the majority, either. So, you know, the game that he\u2019s played, the politics that he\u2019s pursued have given us absolutely nothing and have produced a situation where we lose nearly 40,000 of our fellow Americans every year.\u201d\n\n[Trump says deal on guns \u2018much harder,\u2019 blames Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments last week]\n\nO\u2019Rourke went on to claim broad public support for his plan, which he emphatically advocated during last week\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Houston, creating one of the most talked-about moments of the night.\n\n\u201cWhat [Schumer] may not know, but what I hear loud and clear, because I\u2019m traveling the country, listening to my fellow Americans, is that the people are there,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nO\u2019Rourke later retweeted video of his remarks and took another shot at Schumer in a separate tweet.\n\n\u201cThe American people are with us on this. They\u2019re just waiting on Congress to do the right thing,\u201d he said.\n\nSchumer has a long history of advocating gun control. As a congressman, he was an original author of both the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, signed into law in 1993, and the federal assault weapons ban, signed into law into 1994.\n\nMore recently, he has pushed Senate Republicans to take up two bills passed earlier this year by the Democratic-led House that strengthen background checks for gun purchasers.\n\nDuring last week\u2019s Democratic debate, O\u2019Rourke passionately argued for the need for additional gun control in the wake of recent mass shootings, including one in his hometown of El Paso.\n\n\u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d he said, referring to his support for mandatory buybacks of war weapons.\n\nRepublicans seized on O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments, using them to broadly paint Democrats as overly eager to confiscate firearms, while many Democrats suggested the remarks were not helpful in persuading Republicans to embrace more modest changes, such as expanding background checks for gun purchasers.\n\nDuring a call with Upstate New York reporters earlier this week, Schumer reportedly downplayed the prospects for action on O\u2019Rourke\u2019s mandatory buyback plan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any other Democrat who agrees with Beto O\u2019Rourke, but it\u2019s no excuse not to go forward,\u201d according to the account in the Times Union, an Albany newspaper.\n\nO\u2019Rourke responded to that report on Wednesday, writing on Twitter: \u201cThe party is with us, the country is with us. Now it\u2019s time for Democrats to lead.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump said Wednesday that it has become \u201cmuch harder\u201d to reach a deal with Democrats on gun legislation because of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s call for a mandatory buyback program for assault-style weapons.\n\n\u201cDummy Beto made it much harder to make a deal. Convinced many that Dems just want to take your guns away,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter, adding: \u201cWill continue forward!\u201d\n\nRepublicans in Congress are waiting to hear what legislation Trump might support following the recent spate of mass shootings.", "description": "The White House hopeful escalated his feud with Minority Leader Charles E.
