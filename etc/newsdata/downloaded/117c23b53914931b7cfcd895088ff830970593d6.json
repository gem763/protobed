Mayor Bowser and the city\u2019s arts commission escalates", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nD.C.

Commission on the Arts and Humanities and Mayor Muriel E. Bowser took another turn late last month, when the locks were changed to the storage area that houses the commission\u2019s prized art collection, preventing its staff from accessing it.\n\nThe Bowser administration took control of the collection without warning on Aug. 30, the day after the mayor announced a new Office of Creative Affairs, set to become \u201cthe central coordination body for the reconstituted [arts commission],\u201d according to the official announcement.\n\nLimited access to the art was restored last week, but the move was seen as an escalation of the power struggle between Bowser and the commission, Washington\u2019s partner agency with the National Endowment of the Arts. The commission supports hundreds of D.C.-area visual and performing artists and arts organizations with programs and competitive grants. It distributed $23 million in grants in 2017, and its budget is expected to hit $25 million in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe administration appears to be intent on eroding the foundations of an organization that is so incredibly important to artists and small organizations like us,\u201d said Peter Nesbett, executive director of the Washington Project for the Arts. \u201cArtists have lost a fair amount of faith in the mayor and her support for the fine arts.\u201d\n\n[D.C. arts commission backs down on censoring art]\n\nThe latest episode is tied to the fight for control of the commission, which will shift from the mayor\u2019s office to an independent agency Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year. The D.C. Council added language to the 2020 budget bill making the commission an independent agency, like the city\u2019s library system, to protect it from political interference. Last year, the mayor proposed creating a broader office for the arts, which would include culinary and other creative endeavors, and making the commission an advisory council. She hired an executive director who supported these changes.\n\n\u201c[Bowser] will have to work with, rather than direct, the commission,\u201d said Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D). \u201cIn the scheme of things, that shouldn\u2019t be a big deal.\u201d\n\nMendelson pledged to help the commission make a smooth transition to a status that is not uncommon in city government.\n\n\u201cTuesday, the first of October, will be the same as Monday, the 30th of September. Same commission, same responsibilities,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nA mural of late D.C. saxophonist Buck Hill was unveiled in late August on 14th Street NW.

The works are lent to government agencies for display in their offices.\n\n\u201cThe art collection is the property of and insured by District of Columbia Government. We have a fiduciary responsibility to maintain these valuable assets and their rich cultural history,\u201d Chanda Washington, director of communications for the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning & Economic Development, said in a statement.\n\nThe commission\u2019s new status also caused acting executive director Terrie Rouse-Rosario to announce her resignation after only 10 months on the job.\n\n\u201cIn light of . . . the ending of the agency I was hired to lead, it seems only appropriate to resign,\u201d Rouse-Rosario said in a statement. \u201cIn my final weeks on the job, myself and the staff have been working to ensure as smooth a transition as possible for the agency and its constituents.\u201d\n\n[D.C. council approves funding for citywide cultural plan]\n\nCommission Chairwoman Kay Kendall said the search for a new director \u2014 the commission\u2019s fourth leader in four years \u2014 is underway.\n\n\u201cWe are moving as fast as we can to hire a new executive director who can work well with the entire arts community,\u201d Kendall said.\n\nThe developments have created widespread confusion about the role of the new Creative Affairs Office and how it will affect the commission\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m well aware that the mayor\u2019s announcement has created a lot of heartburn. I think it\u2019s the mayor trying to hang on in a way she doesn\u2019t need to,\u201d Mendelson said.\n\nD.C. Council member David Grosso described the commission\u2019s new structure as \u201cquasi-independent\u201d since the commissioners will continue to be nominated by the mayor and approved by the council, and its new executive director will be a D.C. government employee.\n\n\u201cI feel it\u2019s a better approach overall,\u201d he said. \u201cThe independence part is not going to have to go through chain of command in the mayor\u2019s office to give out the grants they think are the best.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, artists and arts leaders are waiting, and worrying.\n\n\u201cDisruptions like this make everybody nervous,\u201d said Meyers, an internationally known artist who is based in Washington and is co-founder of Stable, a new group that supports the D.C. arts community. \u201cWe have an incredibly generous commission on the arts and humanities. It\u2019s a draw for artists. It\u2019s a value added. We\u2019re all concerned that it not go away.\u201d", "description": "A tussle over possession of valuable art collection is latest move against the commission\u2019s independence.", "authors": ["Peggy Mcglone", "Reporter Covering The Arts In The Washington Region", "September At Pm", "Peggy Mcglone Is A Reporter For The Washington Post", "Covering Arts In The Washington Region.
