At a time when U.S. life expectancy has declined for three years in a row, opioids and mental health crises are nearly ubiquitous, and access to affordable care is increasingly dependent on your race, your employer or where you live, these candidates are well-positioned to provide a different vision for the future.\n\nYet they are fixated a single question \u2014 and it\u2019s not the very important question of whether every American should have guaranteed access to affordable care. On that, they all agree. No, they are arguing endlessly about the subsidiary question of \u201chow\u201d universal coverage would be achieved: with or without the availability of private employer-based insurance.\n\nDemocratic presidential debate on Sept. 12, 2019, in Houston.

Any of the Democratic candidates\u2019 plans would be a dramatic shift from the Trump administration, which really is trying to take away your health care. There will be a dozen candidates onstage for the Oct. 15 Democratic debate in Ohio. The country needs to know how they would lead to fix our health care system in five important areas:\n\nThink about health, not just care\n\n\u25baThe next president must have a broad vision that is about health, not just health care or health insurance. We will continue to pay more and get sicker if we don\u2019t work to eliminate racial and other biases that get in the way of health and make sure everyone has better access to preventive tests, good nutrition, affordable housing, trauma counseling, transportation and child care. We dramatically underspend healthier nations in these areas. We should follow the example of North Carolina, a purple state, and reorient health care systems to focus on services that lead to healthy outcomes and lower costs.\n\n\u25baCandidates should speak to all areas of American life, starting with maternal health. We spend billions of dollars a year on premature births and the neonatal intensive care unit. That money should be redirected to pre- and post-natal health and the first 12 months of a child\u2019s life. We must address the epidemic of adolescent mental illness and make children feel safe at school with reasonable gun safety protections. We must reconnect people to the health system, so everyone has a regular source of care and a way to coordinate and manage chronic illnesses. We need to invest billions more in our mental health system so that mental health professionals are more available to people at all stages of life, as mental health parity laws intended. Finally, we should allow people with advanced illness to pursue the best combination of clinical treatment and palliative (comfort) care available, not make them choose one or the other.\n\nAdd a public option: Don't end private health insurance, 2020 Democrats. People want more choice, not less.\n\n\u25baCandidates should talk urgently about how to make the health care system more affordable. Changing how care is paid for so we reward for better outcomes and lower costs began in earnest under the Obama administration and has continued in the Trump administration. It is now accepted wisdom that hospitals should make or lose money based on their efficiency and the health of their patients. The question is how to move faster \u2014 and put pressure on providers that refuse to be accountable. A fully value-based system is around the corner, but it needs a president with the vision and the muscle to stand up to entrenched interests.\n\nPromise you won't be a health purist\n\n\u25baCandidates should lay out how their administration will quickly reestablish rights and access to care for the many \u2014 including women, immigrants and LGBTQ people \u2014 who have lost them under the Trump administration. Trump\u2019s actions have exacerbated grave health disparities. The next president must go further than bringing us back to where we were before Trump. He or she should also commit to putting people from historically underserved communities in key roles in the Department of Health and Human services. A great idea would be to make the next head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid someone from the disability community who knows firsthand how those programs are the lifeblood for so many people.\n\nWhat special-needs kids deserve: Democrats need to ensure that disabled children have equal access to health care\n\n\u25baFinally, to the sole point raised in the Democratic debates, the candidates should say whether they would push for and sign any bill that guarantees affordable health care for everyone in the country, even if it is not their first-choice approach. Paying for this will necessarily mean making tough decisions. The next president should point out that ordinary American taxpayers and clinics that see the neediest are already overburdened, and show how those who profit most from the system should pay the lions\u2019 share. That means prescription drug companies must negotiate with the government, just like they do with the Department of Veterans Affairs, and bring down costs for consumers. Insurance companies and others making money off the system should contribute as well.\n\nThere are rich leadership opportunities for a newly elected Democratic president following a record of broken promises, neglect and outright hostility to Americans\u2019 health care needs. We don\u2019t need a stale debate about a single policy area where Democrats largely agree. We need candidates who will articulate how, as president, they would restore leadership on health care in a nation that has fallen well behind.\n\nAndy Slavitt, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is a former health care industry executive who ran the Affordable Care Act and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from 2015 to 2017.
