At least 18 people died, according to one official count.\n\nChilean prosecutors have since clarified that two of the total died in a car accident unrelated to the riots.\n\nCenter-right leader Sebastian Pinera was to ship a bill to Congress that would overturn a recent hike in electricity rates.\n\nIt is one of several measures he hopes will turn the violent demonstrations into an 'opportunity' for Chile.\n\nAnti-government demonstrators have been protesting in Chile since last Monday after President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era announced a subway fare hike before cancelling it Saturday\n\nProtesters returned to the streets of Valparaiso, Chile, on Monday, just two days after President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era called off a subway fare hike\n\nEcuador's President Lenin Moreno also repealed the elimination of fuel subsidies this month after protests.\n\nBolivia's Evo Morales also faced demonstrations over an election, and Argentina's Mauricio Macri has suffered a backlash over economic turmoil.\n\nIn Chile, anger over inequality and cost of living sent tens of thousands into the streets to demand an overhaul in one of the region's traditionally most stable, and wealthy, nations.\n\nOver five days of unrest that appeared to be dying down on Wednesday night, more than 6,000 people have been detained.\n\nPinera's proposed reforms include a guaranteed minimum wage, a hike in state pensions and reductions in public transportation costs.\n\nSome, such as a bill to provide insurance against catastrophic illness, have already been delivered to lawmakers.\n\nOctavio Solis, 43, an unemployed security guard, said he hoped the government acted quickly.\n\n'We're tired of all this, the protests, the looting. It's a disaster. This isn't the Santiago we once knew,' Solis said as he waited in line to receive an unemployment payment.\n\n'We need good salaries and pensions for our elderly.'", "description": "The woman is believed to have stolen from a supermarket before the unfortunate mishap.
