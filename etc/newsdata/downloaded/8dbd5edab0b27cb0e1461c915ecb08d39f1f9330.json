Last week, McCabe\u2019s lawyers met with federal prosecutors who are deciding whether to indict him for perjury.\n\nSo, of course, CNN hired him last week.\n\n\u201cThey Literally Know Nothing\u201d\n\nOnce upon a time in America, journalists embraced their role as the nation\u2019s whistleblowers; the so-called Fourth Estate could usually be trusted to expose government corruption and name names. A generation of J-school graduates strived to be the next Carl Bernstein or Bob Woodward, digging for their own Watergate moment.\n\nBut that all changed in 2008 with the candidacy of Barack Obama. The press served as a bodyguard for the 44th president, overlooking major abuses and failures during his tenure; suggesting that any legitimate criticism of Obama or his policies was rooted in racism; and regurgitating any administration-fed talking point as fact.\n\nBen Rhodes, Obama\u2019s \u201cmind-meld\u201d advisor, admitted as much when he told a reporter how the White House brainwashed the media: \u201cThe average reporter we talk to is 27-years-old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns,\u201d Rhodes bragged to the New York Times magazine in May 2016. \u201cThat\u2019s a sea change. They literally know nothing.\u201d\n\nThen along came Donald Trump.\n\nThe same outlets that shielded Obama for more than eight years have partnered with partisan government bureaucrats to attack Trump from every angle. And nowhere is the nefarious pact more intertwined than between the Obama Justice Department and the news media.\n\nLeaking and Colluding With Impunity\n\nSince 2016, top Justice Department officials, including powerful FBI chiefs, have conspired with biased reporters to sabotage the Trump campaign and presidency. Reporters played a key role in convincing the American public that the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, manufactured and executed by the Obama Justice Department among other agencies, was true; news articles planted by political operatives with the imprimatur of the DOJ appeared as evidence in government warrants presented to a secret court. Dozens of articles by Trump-hostile news organizations were cited in the final Mueller report on collusion and obstruction of justice.\n\nTwo damning articles containing classified information published early in Trump\u2019s presidency\u2014a February 2017 article about the intercepted phone calls of former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn and an April 2017 article revealing the FISA warrant on campaign aide Carter Page, both published in the Washington Post\u2014were sourced by numerous anonymous intelligence and law enforcement officials. Although the disclosure of classified information is a felony, no one has yet been charged with the crime.\n\nInstead, many of the suspected leakers, such as McCabe, have been rewarded with premium spots on newspaper opinion pages and on cable news programs. They\u2019ve written books, which have earned them large advances, glowing coverage, and lengthy interviews on network primetime shows.\n\nWilling Pawns\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey is a media darling after having spent the latter part of his service to Barack Obama trying to ruin Donald Trump. Not only did he authorize the unprecedented investigation into an American political campaign just months before the 2016 presidential election, Comey was an eager and willing pawn for Trump-hating journalists.\n\nA few weeks before Inauguration Day, Comey briefed Trump on the most salacious portion of the sketchy Steele dossier\u2014the so-called Russian hooker \u201cpee tape\u201d\u2014for the sole purpose of giving CNN a scoop alleging that the Russians had compromising material on the incoming president.\n\nThe former FBI director refused to investigate illegal leaks to the media; after he was fired in May 2017, Comey leaked his \u201cmemos\u201d through a friend to the Times in order to prompt the appointment of a special counsel. Even though Comey is the subject of numerous investigations underway at the Justice Department, he often is featured in the Times opinion pages where he continues to blast Trump and the Republican Party.\n\nComey\u2019s underlings tooks a cue from their boss in 2016 and 2017: Text messages between FBI lawyer Lisa Page and her alleged lover Peter Strzok revealed their extensive \u201cleaking\u201d strategy to plant anti-Trump articles in the press before and after the election.\n\nThe pair repeatedly discussed their contact with journalists, especially those at the New York Times and the Washington Post. They pitched talking points to the Post about Russian interference in the election then exchanged a link to a September 5, 2016 article warning about a federal investigation into the Kremlin\u2019s activities. The piece cited a \u201csenior intelligence official who, like others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.\u201d Strzok was a top official in the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division.\n\nThey continued to manipulate the press after Inauguration Day, constantly tracking when their planted stories were posted. Several texts refer to \u201cAndy,\u201d meaning Andrew McCabe, CNN\u2019s newest mouthpiece. The lovers fretted when one news outlet was upset about a scoop given to another outlet. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said the Strzok-Page texts raised \u201cgrave concerns regarding a systemic culture of media-leaking by high-ranking officials at the FBI and DOJ.\u201d\n\nStrzok is believed to be the unnamed FBI official that the Justice Department\u2019s Inspector General in May accused of misconduct and violating federal law, including disclosing classified information to the press and accepting gifts from reporters. (He was not charged).\n\n\u201cProfound Concerns\u201d and Sinking Trust\n\nBut Strzok and Page weren\u2019t alone. In his lengthy report on the Clinton email investigation, Inspector General Michael Horowitz detailed the cozy\u2014and prohibited\u2014relationship between the FBI and journalists.\n\n\u201cWe identified numerous FBI employees, at all levels of the organization and with no official reason to be in contact with the media, who were nevertheless in frequent contact with reporters,\u201d Horowitz wrote in his June 2018 report. \u201cWe have profound concerns about the volume and extent of unauthorized media contacts by FBI personnel that we have uncovered during our review. In addition, we identified instances where FBI employees improperly received benefits from reporters, including tickets to sporting events, golfing outings, drinks and meals, and admittance to nonpublic social events.\u201d\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just the FBI in cahoots with the media. Bruce Ohr, a top Justice Department lawyer, served as the agency\u2019s private handler for dossier author Christopher Steele. Ohr\u2019s wife, Nellie, worked with Steele on Trump opposition research on behalf of Fusion GPS, which had been retained by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign.\n\nSteele and Glenn Simpson, Fusion\u2019s co-owner, admitted to meeting with reporters and editors of the country\u2019s top news organizations to pitch the dossier and seed negative stories about Trump before election day. Steele was fired by the FBI (yes, Steele was working for the Democrats and the Obama FBI at the same time in 2016) for leaking his anti-Trump propaganda to the news media before the 2016 election.\n\nOther Obama-era Justice Department officials including former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, former FBI assistant director Frank Figliuzzi and former Justice Department spokesman Matt Miller are regular guests on network and cable news shows to feed the Trump-hating beast.\n\nA poll released last week showed that a majority of Americans not only don\u2019t trust the political news they receive, they think the media actively is trying to block the president\u2019s agenda. At the same time, there is a widening trust deficit in the federal government. Republicans\u2019 favorable view of the FBI has dropped significantly, from 59 percent in 2014 to 48 percent this year.\n\nThe Left and NeverTrump Right whine daily about the alleged damage Trump is inflicting on the presidency. But the real and lasting damage to the media and government institutions once held in esteem by Americans will be far worse. CNN\u2019s hiring of Andrew McCabe just dug that hole a little deeper.\n\nContent created by the Center for American Greatness, Inc. is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a significant audience.
