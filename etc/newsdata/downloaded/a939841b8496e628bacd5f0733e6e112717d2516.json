The accident, which took place off the coast of Japan, involved a F/A-18D Hornet strike fighter attempting to refuel at night from a KC-130 aerial refueling tanker. The report blames collision on a lack of command oversight over operations and training, as well as an \u201cunprofessional command climate.\u201d\n\nThe report rules out aircraft malfunction, stating that all aircraft were \u201cfully functional.\u201d The flight data recorder from the F/A-18D was recovered as was the cockpit voice recorder and data recorder from the KC-130J. Investigators relied on information from both as well as numerous interviews to complete the 1,600 page report, released here by U.S. Naval Institute News.\n\nThe collision took place off the coast of Japan on the night of December 6, 2018. Two F/A-18D Hornets assigned to Marine All Weather Fighter Attack Squadron 242, otherwise known as VMFA (AW)-242, were practicing nighttime refueling from a KC-130J tanker transport. The F/A-18D is a special Marine-only version of the original Hornet fighter, a twin-seat aircraft that specializes in fighting at night and in bad weather.\n\nThe aircraft were refueling under realistic conditions with the pilots wearing night vision goggles to see in the dark. Additionally, the Hornet fighters were flying with navigation lights turned off.\n\nPhoto credit: U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Samantha K. Torres More\n\nAccording to the report the two Hornets, call sign PROFANE 11 and PROFANE 12, were flying alongside the tanker, call sign SUMO 41. The three aircraft were flying at 15,000 feet, and it was 1:30 in the morning local time. The two Hornets attached to the tanker to begin refueling, with PROFANE 11 on right side refueling hose and PROFANE 12 on the left hose. After refueling was complete both aircraft were supposed to fly off the KC-130J\u2019s right side. PROFANE 11 completed fueling and detached right, flying off the right wing of the tanker.\n\nPROFANE 11, the formation leader, requested PROFANE 12 fly off the tanker\u2019s left wing after refueling, what the Marine accident investigators are calling a \u201cnonstandard position.\u201d SUMO 41, in charge of the refueling, approved the request. PROFANE 12 completed refueling and PROFANE 11 ordered the pilot to fly off the left side, which again, was not standard procedure.\n\nAfter PROFANE 12 had completed refueling, SUMO 41 directed the pilot to fly off his right side. PROFANE 11, the formation leader, again requested that PROFANE 12 fly off the tanker\u2019s left side. SUMO 41 approved the request.\n\nPhoto credit: U.S. Marine Corps photo by Capt.
