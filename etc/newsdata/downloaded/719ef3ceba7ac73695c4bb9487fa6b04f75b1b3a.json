If you have a lot of apps, dislike having to deal with grids, or just feel fat-fingered, that display may not serve you well.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, there is an alternative. You can organize your apps in an alphabetical list instead.\n\nFrom any Watch face, press the Digital Crown to see the honeycomb of apps\n\nForce touch the Watch\u2019s display. (Press the display with a little more force than you usually would.) You\u2019ll get some haptic feedback, and the Watch will show a screen giving you the choice of using grid view or list view.\n\nTap list view, and you\u2019ll be shown an alphabetical list of all the apps you\u2019ve installed, with the app\u2019s icon next to each name. Several apps fit on each screen, and you can scroll through the list by rotating the crown or by flicking up and down on the list with your finger.\n\nGrid View You may find the Apple Watch\u2019s apps grid hard to navigate.\n\nPress on the display to bring up this option.\n\nNow your apps are in an alphabetical list.\n\nThe view you pick is persistent, meaning it stays selected until you change it. Once you pick list view, that\u2019s how you\u2019ll see your apps the next time you press the crown. Of course, you can always return it to grid view by following the same procedure.", "description": "When you look at all of the apps that are installed on your Apple Watch, you probably see them in the familiar default \"honeycomb\" grid array.
