He has a rare condition that causes him to cackle uncontrollably and carries a card that reads \u201cForgive my laughter\u201d. Fleck dreams of being a successful standup comedian but earns minimum wage as a pathetic party clown named Carnival. He is sad, single and living in a cruddy apartment with his ageing mother Penny (Frances Conroy). No wonder, then, that since its premiere at the Venice international film festival in August, Phoenix\u2019s anarchic, ultraviolent Joker has been understood as a kind of stand-in for basement-dwelling incels-turned-mass shooters, and the film itself a timely evocation of a tense, Trumpian cultural moment.\n\nThe film grasps for ways to cheekily telegraph its relevance. Fleck\u2019s mother is hinted to be the victim of a #MeToo-esque scandal involving Bruce Wayne\u2019s father; a TV clip of a shooting goes \u201cviral\u201d. A scene that sees Joker woozily pirouetting down a flight of steps in a three-piece suit is played for maximum swag \u2013 and set to the sounds of Rock and Roll Part 2, the 1972 track from convicted paedophile Gary Glitter.\n\nFleck accidentally becomes a vigilante symbol when he is spotted gunning down three bankers on the subway, face painted like a mournful jester. This sparks a wave of Occupy-style protests across the film\u2019s early-80s Gotham City. Except that Phillips and Silver are only interested in the imagery of revolt, not its ideas. An angry mob is both generic and a shorthand; upon closer inspection, Charlie Hebdo-ish protest signs are so banal they might as well read: \u201cJe suis Carnival\u201d. Lest viewers underestimate the profundity of what\u2019s on show, Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir\u2019s thundering cello score is there to remind them.\n\nFleck is bemused by the kerfuffle, insisting that he is \u201cnot political\u201d, and there\u2019s something in the idea that public figures are easily co-opted by the violent far right. Still, the film isn\u2019t daring enough to pass as truly nihilistic. Writers Todd Phillips and Scott Silver buffer Fleck from identification with white supremacy by giving him a crush on his African American neighbour (Zazie Beetz). It is a sign, perhaps, that there is a concern about alienating certain ticket-buying audiences.\n\nJoker does not invite ambivalence. When the character refrains from sharing a joke with a psychiatrist, it is because she \u201cwouldn\u2019t get it\u201d. The film is awfully pleased with itself; Phoenix\u2019s twisted smile is less the iconic, toothy grin associated with the title character, more a smug, self-satisfied smirk.", "description": "Critics have acclaimed Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s latest film as a knowing evocation of our times.
