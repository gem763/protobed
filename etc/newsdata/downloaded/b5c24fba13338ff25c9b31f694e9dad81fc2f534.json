Those audits are automatic for sitting presidents and vice presidents.\n\nIn a court filing, Democrats said they were first approached in July by a federal employee \u201csetting forth credible allegations of \u2018evidence of possible misconduct\u2019 \u2014 specifically, potential \u2018inappropriate efforts to influence\u2019 the mandatory audit program.\u201d They did not offer additional details, though lawyers for the House said they could tell the judge more in private.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that in his complaint, the whistleblower said he was told that at least one Treasury official had attempted to improperly influence the IRS examination. The person declined to discuss specifics in an interview with the Post.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
