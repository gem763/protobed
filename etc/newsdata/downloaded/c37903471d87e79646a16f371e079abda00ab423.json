It's about finding their music, their identity and what laid the foundation for their work as LGBTQ ambassadors.\n\nMeanwhile the album, Hey, I'm Just Like You (out Sept. 27), reimagines early demos they wrote as teenagers.\n\n\"I definitely think that there was a vulnerability and there was a directness to the music that I think you lose when you become a public figure,\" Tegan told q host Tom Power. \"I feel like our early music was under-appreciated, and I'm very honest about this. I think that we were written off because we were young and we were girls.\"\n\nComing of age in the '90s, the duo said they were uncomfortable in their skin and remember often feeling isolated because they were gay.\n\nTegan and Sara perform their song Please Help Me live in the q studio. 3:13\n\n\"I just had an overwhelming anxiety about it,\" said Sara. \"When I go back and I look at that person at 15, I don't think it's an over-dramatization to say that I really was distressed.\"\n\nOne of the challenges they faced was a lack of positive queer role models to look up to.\n\n\"As a small kid, I remember one of my first introductions to the idea of homosexuality \u2014 this is going to be really dark \u2014 but it was Jeffrey Dahmer, the serial killer who killed gay men. I didn't know what homosexuality was unless I was hearing about it on the news.\"\n\nDespite being very close and having a 20-year career together, the identical twin sisters said that they were partly driven to write their first memoir to show how their personal stories and experiences have differed from each other's.\n\nTegan and Sara perform their song Hello live in the q studio. 2:59\n\n\"We really did want to dispel a lot of the myths and imagined projections that people put on us \u2014 us as individuals, as Tegan and Sara, but also as twins and as women,\" said Tegan.\n\n\"I think this assumption that we were each other's best friend, you know, we were both queer, we found comfort in each other because we were able to confide in each other.\"\n\n\"We wanted to talk about the complex nature of being an identical twin, of sharing your identity, of desperately needing to create an independent world and to be your own individual person. And that all started in childhood. Sara and I, we were unique.\"\n\nYou can catch Tegan and Sara on tour , with shows throughout Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. until November.\n\nDownload our podcast or click 'Listen' near the top of this page to hear the full extended interview with Tegan and Sara where they talk more about coming of age, coming out and getting their start at a Calgary talent competition called Garage Warz.\n\n\u2014 Produced by \u200bMitch Pollock", "description": "Tegan and Sara joined q's Tom Power to talk about their new book, High School, and their new album, Hey, I'm Just Like You, which revisits early demos.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5294100.1569258330!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/tegan-and-sara.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
