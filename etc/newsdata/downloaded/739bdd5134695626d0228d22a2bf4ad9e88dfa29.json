In addition, a senior U.S. senator demanded an investigation of the withholding of the aid. Biden\u2019s campaign said he would make a statement on the issue later in the day.\n\nTrump on Monday had denied trying to coerce Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July 25 phone call to launch a corruption investigation into Biden, the front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and Biden\u2019s son in return for the U.S. military aid.\n\nArriving at the United Nations before his speech to the annual General Assembly, Trump confirmed that he had wanted the money for Ukraine frozen, saying European should countries provide assistance to Kiev, but changed his mind after \u201cpeople called me.\u201d\n\nHowever, Trump told reporters as he arrived at the United Nations that he still felt other nations should be paying to help Ukraine. \u201cThe money was paid, but very importantly, Germany, France, other countries should put up money,\u201d Trump said.\n\nRegarding aid to Ukraine, Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re putting up the bulk of the money, and I\u2019m asking why is that...What I want, and I insist on it, is that Europe has to put up money for Ukraine also.\u201d\n\nTrump on Tuesday indicated that he expects a \u201creadout\u201d of the phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president to be made public.\n\n\u201cAnd when you see the call, when you see the readout of the call, which I assume you\u2019ll see at some point, you\u2019ll understand. That call was perfect. It couldn\u2019t have been nicer,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\nSenator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Congress had not been made aware of any substantive review of security assistance to Ukraine or any policy reason the funds should have been withheld.\n\nIn a letter to Mike Mulvaney, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Menendez said \u201cit is becoming clear that\u201d Trump put pressure on Ukrainian officials.\n\nMenendez, in one of three letters sent to administration officials, also said \u201cwe must immediately understand whether, and to what extent, the President and his team converted duly-appropriated United States foreign assistance funds for his personal and political benefit, and what role federal agencies may have played in it.\u201d\n\nIMPEACHMENT EFFORTS\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the House has the power to impeach a president for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d and the Senate then holds a trial on whether to remove the president from office.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he arrives to address the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York City, New York, U.S., September 24, 2019. REUTERS/Yana Paskova\n\nPelosi had in the past opposed impeachment efforts but appeared to be moving closer as Democrats demand that the Trump administration release details of a whistleblower complaint and the transcript of his call with Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nTrump on Tuesday accused Democrats of considering impeachment for purely political reasons.\n\n\u201cThey have no idea how they stop me. The only way they can try is through impeachment,\u201d Trump said at the United Nations.\n\nIn his letter, Menendez noted that the U.S. State and Defense Departments recommended and prepared to distribute in late June $391.5 million in military and security assistance to boost Ukraine\u2019s armed forces as the country dealt with Russian aggression and sought to improve maritime security in the Black Sea.\n\nHowever, weeks before Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy, OMB blocked the aid, Menendez said in the letter to Mulvaney.\n\n\u201cUkrainian officials were reportedly \u2018blindsided,\u2019\u201d Menendez wrote. \u201cFor months, despite repeated inquiries from my office and others, administration officials have been unable to offer any policy justification for why these funds were blocked.\u201d\n\nOMB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn his letters, Menendez asked for information about who decided to withhold the funds, whether Trump directed that they be withheld, how the administration communicated between departments about the decision and what changed between the decision in June and the release of the money this month.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Ranking member Bob Menendez (D-NJ) questions U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a Senate foreign Relations Committee hearing on the State Department budget request in Washington, U.S. April 10, 2019. REUTERS/Erin Scott\n\n\u201cI understand from State Department officials that the White House provided the Department with no official reason for delaying security assistance to Ukraine for almost three months, which is highly disconcerting,\u201d Menendez wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nA Senate aide told Reuters on Tuesday that officials from the State Department confirmed to Senate staff on Friday that neither it nor the Pentagon had policy objections to the release of money to Ukraine. The aide said Senate staff had also been told that it was Mulvaney who directed the State department not to send the money to Ukraine.", "description": "President Donald Trump confirmed on Tuesday he had withheld U.S. aid to Ukraine, an action at the center of a political storm over allegations that he pressured the country's leader to investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433369447&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N19V", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
