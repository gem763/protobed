When announcing the Series 3 in 2017, it cut the price of the Series 1 to $250 from $270.\n\nWith the Apple event right around the corner, it's worth waiting a few more days to see if Apple does debut a new Apple Watch. By doing so, you'll have the opportunity to decide whether the new model is the right choice for you based on your budget and priorities.
