And yet, whether he understands the consequences of his actions or not, the president has a curious habit of testing the limits of his allies\u2019 loyalties.\n\nCongressional Republicans, for example, thought Trump had made a \u201chuge mistake\u201d releasing an incriminating call summary two weeks ago, but the president ignored them. GOP lawmakers were broadly disgusted when Trump \u2013 apparently on a whim \u2013 changed his policy toward Syria and abandoned our Kurdish allies without giving so much as a heads-up to his ostensible allies on Capitol Hill.\n\nCongressional Republicans were blindsided again when the White House blocked Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, from appearing on Capitol Hill, which came on the heels of the president putting GOP lawmakers in an awkward position by calling for Sen. Mitt Romney\u2019s (R-Utah) impeachment \u2013 something that isn\u2019t even possible in our system of government.\n\nAll of which is to say, at a time when Trump desperately needs unyielding Republican support, the president has taken a series of needlessly provocative steps that have angered and alienated the GOP officials whose backing he needs.\n\nThe Washington Post reported overnight, \u201cThere is an acknowledgment inside some quarters of the West Wing that Trump cannot ignore the skittishness of Republicans.\u201d\n\nIn the coming weeks, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney is planning to help Trump begin a quiet charm offensive with congressional Republicans, hosting private dinners and meetings, gatherings at Camp David and other ways of expressing appreciation for their support, according to three Trump advisers who were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nCNN, meanwhile, reported that the president has been \u201clighting up the phone lines of his allies on Capitol Hill,\u201d including multiple calls per day to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), \u201cto whom he\u2019s stressed the importance of Republican unity.\u201d\n\nThe CNN report, which hasn\u2019t been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, added that Trump has warned McConnell that he\u2019s prepared to \u201camplify attacks on those Republicans who criticize him.\u201d\n\nOr put another way, the president has a carrot and a stick approach in mind.\n\nChances are, Republicans will do what they\u2019ve consistently done: cover for Trump and make every effort to shield him from accountability. Indeed, three weeks into the White House\u2019s impeachment crisis, we\u2019ve already seen GOP officials embarrass themselves in the hopes of downplaying the scandal.\n\nBut this latest reporting suggests the president, his outward posture notwithstanding, isn\u2019t altogether confident in his intra-party position.", "description": "The latest reporting suggests the president, his outward posture notwithstanding, isn't altogether confident in his intra-party position.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/2017-05-04t204549z_69373343_hp1ed541loc1z_rtrmadp_3_usa-healthcare-trump.jpg?itok=NFvoJZBw", "published_at": "2017-05-04"}
