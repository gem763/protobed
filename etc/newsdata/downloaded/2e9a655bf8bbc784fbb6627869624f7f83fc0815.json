Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), both members of the Foreign Relations Committee, said Russia denied their visas as part of a congressional delegation. A third senator, Republican Mike Lee of Utah, is planning to travel to Russia next week but hasn't had his visa granted or denied yet, a spokesman said Tuesday afternoon.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThose revelations were quickly followed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democrats arguing to Trump that \u201cunder no circumstances\u201d should Putin be allowed to take part in the meeting of the leaders of major industrial nations. In 2014, Russia was expelled from the organization, then known as the Group of Eight, after illegally annexing Crimea.\n\nMurphy warned in a statement Tuesday morning that denying visas to members of Congress could further stymie dialogue between the United States and Russia. He emphasized that it\u2019s in the world\u2019s best interest to prevent conflict between the two countries.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the Russian government is further isolating their country by blocking our visit and several others in recent months,\u201d Murphy said. \u201c With the collapse of recent arms control agreements and significant domestic opposition to Vladimir Putin\u2019s authoritarian rule, this is potentially a perilous moment for our two nations\u2019 fragile relationship.\u201d\n\nLee is scheduled to meet with outgoing U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman, Jr., in Moscow next week, Lee's spokesman said. Huntsman is a former governor of Utah.\n\nRussia's barring senators and Schumer's letter, taken together, heighten the already fraught relationship between Congress and Putin even as Trump pushed for Putin's inclusion into the G-7.\n\n\"The state of affairs is very poor,\" said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who said he'd never applied for a visa.\n\nThe Russia hawk didn't rule out the possibility of Russia joining the G8 given the country's nuclear arsenal and place on the United Nations Security Council, but questioned whether Putin had done anything to change his country's behavior.\n\n\"We can\u2019t ignore Russia or stop dealing with them but we should do so with clear eyes. But it\u2019s something we need to talk to other members states as well,\" he told reporters at the Capitol on Tuesday. \"I don\u2019t know about what the rationale is about now, none of the behavior that got them kicked out of the G8 has changed.\"\n\nJohnson also said Monday evening that he too was denied entry to the country; the Wisconsin senator was part of a Republican delegation that visited last summer.\n\nOn Monday night, Johnson criticized Putin, including for failing to hold free and fair elections, supporting Syria and annexing Crimea.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was then chairman of the Armed Services Committee, from entering the country. McCain had supported sanctions against the country for invading Crimea.\n\nThe denial of visas to the senators highlights an ongoing conflict between members of the Senate and the White House when it comes the United States\u2019 relationship with Russia.\n\nTrump said on Monday his \u201cinclination is to say yes, [Russia] should be in\u201d the G-7, again rattling U.S. beliefs that the country should remain on the sidelines of the international group. Trump said there were discussions in France about the matter and that he found agreement that \u201chaving them inside the room is better than having them outside the room.\u201d\n\nIn the letter to the president, Schumer and other Democratic leaders argued that is misguided because \u201cRussia does not currently possess the democratic institutions nor the economic capacity to rejoin the group.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats argued that since its expulsion, Russia has done little to prove itss worth by meddling in U.S. elections, supporting the states of Syria and Venezuela, and stifling political debate in Russia.\n\n\u201cFor these reasons, under no circumstances should President Putin be invited to participate in the G-7 until the Russian government undertakes demonstrable actions to show its willingness to behave responsibly both domestically and abroad,\u201d they wrote. \u201cReadmitting Putin\u2019s Russia to the G-7 would be contrary to our values and a clear abdication of the United States\u2019 responsibilities as the world\u2019s leading democracy.\u201d\n\nThe letter was also signed by Sens. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Mark Warner of Virginia, and Bob Menendez of New Jersey, who lead Democrats on key national security committees.", "description": "The moves come as Trump has sought Putin's inclusion into the G-7.", "authors": ["Marianne Levine", "Burgess Everett"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/cc/19/6a0ce6a14b5099e1f93b60419967/190827-trump-putin-getty-773.jpg"}
