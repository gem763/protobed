While it is normal to feel down from time to time, people with depression may feel persistently unhappy for weeks or months on end. Depression can affect anyone at any age and is fairly common \u2013 approximately one in ten people are likely to experience it at some point in their life. Depression is a genuine health condition which people cannot just ignore or 'snap out of it'. Symptoms and effects vary, but can include constantly feeling upset or hopeless, or losing interest in things you used to enjoy. It can also cause physical symptoms such as problems sleeping, tiredness, having a low appetite or sex drive, and even feeling physical pain. In extreme cases it can lead to suicidal thoughts. Traumatic events can trigger it, and people with a family history may be more at risk. It is important to see a doctor if you think you or someone you know has depression, as it can be managed with lifestyle changes, therapy or medication.

The findings were published in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nThe authors wrote: 'These findings add to a growing literature showing a modest change to diet is a useful adjunct therapy to reduce symptoms of depression.'\n\nThe team of academics followed up with 33 of the participants from the healthy diet group after three months.\n\nIn this small sample, they found while only 21 per cent of them stuck to the healthy diet, those that did maintained their improvements in mood.\n\nRichard Colwill, spokesman for the mental health charity SANE, said the study 'adds to the body of evidence' that suggests a healthy diet can improve mental health.\n\nHe added: 'However, for those people who are struggling with poor mental health we would also encourage other lifestyle choices, such as regular exercise and making sure you do not miss any meals (especially breakfast) as low blood sugar can depress mood.\n\n'Most importantly, if you are experiencing depression or anxiety, and it has lasted for more than a fortnight and is affecting your ability to lead your life, you should seek professional support and treatment. Your GP is a good place to start.'", "description": "Researchers from the Macquarie University in Australia looked at 76 depressed university students whose daily meals were mostly made up of processed foods, sugar, and saturated fats.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/12/19487678-0-image-a-6_1570620383891.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
