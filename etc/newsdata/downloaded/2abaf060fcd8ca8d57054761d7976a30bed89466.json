The White House said on October 6 that President Donald Trump had given his endorsement for a Turkish military operation that would sweep away American-backed Kurdish forces near the border in Syria. (Ivor Prickett/The New York Times)\n\nWritten by David E Sanger\n\nPresident Donald Trump is once again pursuing a national security strategy at odds with the official position of his government, ordering a pullback of US forces just inside the Syrian border. It is a move that his own senior advisers have warned would risk new chaos throughout the region.\n\nHe is demonstrating that in his pursuit of ending America\u2019s \u201cendless wars,\u201d no US troop presence abroad is too small to escape his desire to terminate it. In this case, the mission has been to prevent Islamic State forces from reconstituting, and to keep another conflict at bay \u2014 a Turkish attack on Kurdish forces, including on those that have been America\u2019s staunchest allies in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nTo the Pentagon and the State Department, that is a traditional role for US troops, honed over 75 years of global leadership. But if there is a Trump doctrine around the world after 32 months of chaotic policymaking, it may have been expressed in its purest form when the president vented on Twitter on Monday morning: \u201cTime for us to get out.\u201d\n\nJust this summer, the State Department\u2019s special envoy for Syrian affairs, James F Jeffrey, one of America\u2019s most experienced Middle East hands, told a public forum not to worry about a precipitous withdrawal. \u201cWe plan on having a small residual force to remain on for an indefinite time,\u201d he said. The president, he added, \u201cis much seized with this.\u201d But perhaps not seized the way Jeffrey imagined.\n\nLong before he was elected, Trump had sounded a recurrent theme about Syria \u2014 as well as about the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the US presence in Japan and South Korea, and other global deployments. Acting as the world\u2019s policeman was too expensive, he complained. Allies played us for \u201csuckers.\u201d Both in the campaign and today, Trump sensed that many Americans share his view \u2014 and polls show he is right, even among some who loathe Trump himself.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd\n\nSo when President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey spoke by telephone with Trump on Sunday, the Turkish leader likely knew exactly what he was doing: circumventing the US generals and diplomats who sing the praises of maintaining the traditional American forward presence around the world. The Turkish leader could appeal to Trump\u2019s instincts, and clear a path for his forces to fight those he calls \u201cterrorists\u201d over his border, even though they are the same Kurdish troops who have long been allies of the United States.\n\nTrump\u2019s sudden abandonment of the Kurds was another example of the independent, parallel foreign policy he has run from the White House, which has largely abandoned the elaborate systems created since President Harry Truman\u2019s day to think ahead about the potential costs and benefits of presidential decisions. That system is badly broken today. Trump is so suspicious of the professional staff \u2014 many drawn from the State Department and the CIA \u2014 and so dismissive of the \u201cdeep state\u201d foreign policy establishment, that he usually announces decisions first, and forces the staff to deal with them later.\n\nIt has happened time and time again on Syria. When he announced a unilateral withdrawal late last year, it was the final straw for Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whose resignation letter was a searing indictment of Trump\u2019s disregard for allies and alliances.\n\nBy Monday morning, both traditional US allies and Trump\u2019s staunchest Republican defenders, the ones standing up for him in the impeachment battle, argued that the decision was a victory for authoritarian leaders across the geopolitical spectrum.\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, said Trump had rewarded America\u2019s adversaries. \u201cA precipitous withdrawal of US forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran and the Assad regime,\u201d McConnell said in a statement, a reference to Bashar Assad, the Syrian dictator. \u201cAnd it would increase the risk that ISIS and other terrorist groups regroup,\u201d using a common abbreviation for the Islamic State.\n\nIn the most biting line, he urged Trump \u201cto exercise American leadership.\u201d\n\nMcConnell was among the Trump allies who cheered the president when, not even three months after his inauguration, he ordered the first military strike of his presidency, a missile attack against Syrian air bases in response to evidence that Assad had, once again, gassed his own people. Trump said he reacted to pictures of Syrian children suffering in the gas attack.\n\nBut he also ordered the action while Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, was at his dinner table at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort, eating what the president called \u201cthe most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you have ever seen.\u201d It was clearly meant as a message: There was a new sheriff in town.\n\nXi may have a different view now. Trump\u2019s calls for restraint have often followed his threats of fire and fury. Xi and the North Koreans may both have reason to believe that Trump may pull back from the Pacific \u2014 their fondest wish \u2014 in return for few concessions. It is a possibility Trump himself has periodically raised with aides while complaining about trade deficits.\n\nAfter Trump mysteriously suspended military aid to Ukraine in July \u2014 now the subject of an impeachment inquiry into whether he was holding the aid hostage in return for politically damaging information on former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 his stated argument was that the United States paid too much, and Europeans too little.\n\nIf there was any discussion in the White House about how slowing the military aid might damage efforts to contain Russia\u2019s power in the region, it has not surfaced.\n\nWhen he pulled out of the nuclear deal with Iran, it was over the objections of a secretary of state, a national security adviser and a secretary of defense \u2014 all since departed \u2014 who urged him to build on the past agreement. Sixteen months later, he fired his next national security adviser, the hawkish John R. Bolton, for fear that Bolton would send him down the road to another \u201cforever war.\u201d\n\nIn that regard, Trump has correctly read the American people who, after Iraq and Afghanistan, also have a deep distaste for forever wars. It is the one issue on which Trump and former President Barack Obama agree, and a reason for Obama\u2019s decision not to make good on his promise of bombing Assad for crossing the \u201cred line\u201d of using poison gas.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s objections go beyond Obama\u2019s. \u201cLike some of those who are running to replace him, President Trump has conflated \u2018forever wars\u2019 with an open-ended presence,\u201d said Richard N Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a senior George W Bush administration official as America went into two wars between 2001 and 2003.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had 70 years of open-ended presence in Germany, Japan, South Korea,\u201d he noted. \u201cIt\u2019s part of an alliance. And it keeps countries from doing things you don\u2019t want them to do,\u201d like building their own nuclear weapons.\n\nThe Syria presence, Mattis had argued, was in that vein \u2014 low risk, low casualty, high returns for America\u2019s security. It was a tripwire to keep the Islamic State from rising again, and Turkey from starting a war. Trump\u2019s Sunday night tweet, saying everyone in the region was going to have to work things out themselves, announced an abdication of that role.\n\nTrump may well pull back in coming days; in fact, by lunchtime Monday he already appeared to be pivoting, declaring on Twitter that \u201cif Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey.\u201d\n\nIt was a strange threat to utter to a NATO ally. It did not specify what was out of bounds. And most of all, it did not describe how the United States would exercise that kind of power in a world in which America is viewed in many capitals as already getting out.", "description": "By ordering a pullback of US forces inside the Syrian border, Trump is demonstrating that in his pursuit of ending America s endless wars, no US troop presence abroad is too small to escape his desire to terminate it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAIrdZK.img?h=167&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
