It would be a great history for Nigeria,\u201d said their skipper Ademola Onikoyi, after his team took the place of Zimbabwe following their suspension by the ICC.\n\n\u201cOur juniors will be at the World Cup next year in South Africa, so we want to do that as well.\u201d\n\nSingapore, led by Amjad Mahboob, are also debutants at the qualifying event, while Bermuda will be looking to repeat the heroics of their side who famously reached the 2007 World Cup.\n\nThe qualifiers get underway on Friday, with Scotland facing Singapore in the opening Group A game, while Ireland take on Hong Kong and the UAE play Oman in Group B.", "description": "Dubai (AFP) \u2013 Ireland captain Gary Wilson wants his side to ensure they finish \u201cright at the top again\u201d in the upcoming 2020 T20 World", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/641457_ireland-captain-gary-wilson-his-ensure-we-finish-top-in-upcoming-2020-t20-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
