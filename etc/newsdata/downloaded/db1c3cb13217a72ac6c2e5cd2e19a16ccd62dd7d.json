The department\u2019s Office of Inspector General has\n\nquestioned the legality\n\nof the decision.\n\nThe move has already had negative effects as employees leave the agencies. ERS was forced to delay or quash research after losing nearly 80 percent of its staff as employees fled rather than relocated.\n\nThe House did not include funding for the move in the USDA spending bill, but the Senate version passed Tuesday did.\n\n\u201cIt is disappointing that this bill supports the administration\u2019s ill-advised relocation of USDA research agencies. I have spoken out about this relocation effort and remain concerned about the loss of expertise and focus such a move precipitates at USDA,\u201d Sen.

The move would leave just 61 of the agency\u2019s 10,000 employees in Washington.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sens.
