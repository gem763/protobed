So for Lack and Oppenheim \u2014 whom many current and former \u201cToday\u201d staffers allege were well aware of Lauer\u2019s predations, if not complicit \u2014 to still have the support of NBC-Universal prompts one obvious question:\n\nHow many other monsters are hiding in plain sight at 30 Rock?\n\nWhen NBC fired Matt Lauer in November 2017, Savannah Guthrie read, on-air, a statement issued by Lack, chairman of NBC News, stating that this was \u201cthe first complaint about [Lauer\u2019s] behavior in the over 20 years he\u2019s been at NBC News.\u201d Later that day, Oppenheim, the division\u2019s president, told staffers that said complaint alleged \u201cunacceptable\u201d but not criminal acts.\n\nLet\u2019s pause. If that were the case \u2014 if the face of NBC News, earning $20 million per year, ferried to his Midtown set from his Hamptons estate via helicopter by the network \u2014 suddenly faced one accusation throughout an otherwise unimpeachable tenure, why would the network immediately fire him? Why not, at best, suspend him and conduct an investigation? Why remove the body before investigating the crime scene?\n\nLack and Oppenheim would have us believe that they, veteran newsmen who oversaw high-level investigative teams and produced award-winning reportage \u2014 Lack himself has 10 Emmys and two Peabodys \u2014 never heard nor saw a thing.\n\nThey claim Farrow, who left NBC acrimoniously, has an ax to grind. His new book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d details a litany of credible accusations against Lauer, including the brutal rape of Meredith Vieira\u2019s then-assistant (Lauer denies it and other allegations of sexual abuse). Former \u201cToday\u201d show co-anchor Ann Curry told Farrow that she reported Lauer to two senior NBC execs in 2010, after a subordinate tearfully told Curry that Lauer had cornered her in his office, exposed his erect penis and, when rebuffed, said, \u201cYou\u2019re a f\u2013king tease. This is not good. You led me on.\u201d\n\nThreatening, in effect, her career.\n\n\u201cI told [execs] that they had a problem in him,\u201d Curry told Farrow. \u201cThat he had a problem with women. And that they had to keep an eye on him.\u201d\n\nAnother woman, this one an on-air host with, one would assume, some degree of power, told Farrow that Lauer and another exec, who has since left NBC, sexually harassed her. She kept the messages and showed them to coworkers. She also said Lauer and his compatriot made sexually degrading comments about her on set, over open mics.\n\nAnd then there was the staffer who, according to the New York Times, was summoned to Lauer\u2019s office one day. After entering, he allegedly locked the door remotely, using a button installed on his desk, then bent her over a chair and had sex with her until she passed out. Lauer\u2019s assistant had to take her to a nurse.\n\nNo one knew? Lack nor Oppenheim had any idea? As Farrow writes, Lauer didn\u2019t conceal his behavior, which frankly sounds compulsive: Matt Lauer seems to love nothing more than using and degrading women. He \u201cgifted\u201d one coworker a sex toy along with a note detailing the ways he\u2019d violate her with it. A favorite game, again over hot mics, was \u201cf\u2013k/marry/kill.\u201d\n\nEveryone knew. Let\u2019s revisit the long-forgotten secret roast of Lauer here at the Friars Club in 2008. No recording devices were allowed, but the Village Voice\u2019s Tony Ortega took detailed notes under his table.\n\nMeredith Vieira: \u201cLook at Katie Couric. She juggled Matt\u2019s balls for six years. She squeezed those suckers so tight, she left nothing for me \u2026 People say he\u2019s so prim and proper, like he\u2019s got a stick up his ass. It\u2019s not a stick, my friends, it\u2019s Al Roker\u2019s d\u2013k.\u201d\n\n\u2018I told [execs] that they had a problem in him. \u2026 And that they had to keep an eye on him.\u2019\n\nKatie Couric did a Top 10 List. \u201cWhen Katie did the colonoscopy live on television, doctors found Matt\u2019s head.\u201d Another thing the assembled crowd, which included Roker, Howard Stern, Aretha Franklin, Jeff Zucker (then NBC-Universal CEO, now head of CNN) and Diane Sawyer might not know?\n\n\u201cMatt,\u201d Couric said, \u201cloves to eat Curry.\u201d\n\nAnn Curry, according to the report, was visibly embarrassed.\n\nMartha Stewart got up and said, \u201cI heard NBC executives call Matt the \u2018C\u2013k of the Rock.\u2019\u201d Zucker said Lauer was \u201cthe only guy I know who uses Purell before and after he masturbates\u201d and that it was \u201cjust good to see Matt up here and not under my desk.\u201d\n\nEven MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, who attended the roast but said he left early, offended, told his audience the idea that no one knew strains credulity.\n\n\u201cThe whole theme was that he does the show and then he has sex with people, with employees,\u201d Scarborough said in 2017. \u201cSo this was whispered behind closed doors? No. It was shouted from the mountaintops and everybody laughed about it.\u201d\n\nLauer\u2019s misogyny knew no bounds, extending to women who outpaced and outclassed him \u2014 namely, the Oscar-winning stars and glass-ceiling breakers who had the misfortune to book on \u201cToday.\u201d\n\nEqually clear is that no executive \u2014 surely not Oppenheim, there since 2005 \u2014 either told him to knock it off or saw it as a problem, because he just kept on doing it, that insufferably smug smile always on his face.\n\nTo Sandra Bullock in 2009, who was then promoting rom-com \u201cThe Proposal\u201d: \u201cThe major thing that\u2019s changed, since you were here last? I have now seen you naked \u2026 You\u2019re naked for most of this movie \u2026 Did I mention you have a nude scene in this movie?\u201d\n\nBullock: \u201cPretty much from the time you opened your mouth.\u201d\n\nLauer went on and on. Her nude image was now his \u201cscreensaver,\u201d he looked down at his crotch. He got off on her discomfort. After four minutes, this ostensible conversation was finally over.\n\nLauer: \u201cSandra Bullock, come back more often.\u201d\n\nBullock: \u201cNo. Not after this interview.\u201d\n\nTo Anne Hathaway in 2012, days after she accidentally exposed herself exiting a car at her own move premiere: \u201cNice to see you. Seen a lot of you lately.\u201d\n\nHathaway: \u201cSorry about that.\u201d\n\nLauer: \u201cYou had a little wardrobe malfunction the other night. What\u2019s the lesson learned from that?\u201d\n\nThe lesson learned from that?\n\nIf anything, it\u2019s a question NBC-Universal\u2019s top people should ask not just vis-\u00e0-vis Lauer, Lack, and Oppenheim. (We haven\u2019t even mentioned MSNBC head Phil Griffin, who sexually humiliated Maria Menounos in a staff meeting). There should be an immediate external probe. Lack should not be allowed to retire with dignity, as he plans to in January.\n\nAt the very least, Lack and Oppenheim should be suspended pending further inquiry, and NBC should re-think their immediate succession plan, because the person most likely to succeed Lack?\n\nAs of this week, it\u2019s still, incredibly, Noah Oppenheim.", "description": "At the very least, Andy Lack and Noah Oppenheim should be suspended pending further inquiry, and NBC should re-think their immediate succession plan.", "authors": ["Maureen Callahan", "October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/191017-callahan-nbc-feature.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
