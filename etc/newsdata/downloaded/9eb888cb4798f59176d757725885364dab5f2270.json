The report said the deaths and disappearances of Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA individuals was a Canadian genocide driven by disproportionate levels of violence.\n\nIn 2016, women's groups estimated the number of murdered and missing was around 4,000, higher than the 1,200 figure the RCMP had previously released in a report.\n\nLuger said quantifying the scope of the issue is important in a political system to help facilitate change, but said it has a double edge.\n\nCannupa Hanska Luger is a New Mexico-based artist of Mandan, Hidatsa, Arikara, Laota, Austrian and Norwegian descent who was raised on Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota.

(GoCa)\n\nLuger posted a call-out video on social media asking for submissions and within three months had received enough beads from around Canada and the United States to begin assembling the piece.\n\nIn some of the boxes that he received were letters, which he describes as a kind of alarming, but not surprising. They would say things like, \"out of the 22 beads we made, one of them represents a sister, a mother or an auntie.\"\n\n\"The overall piece weighs a literal ton and it's so much heavier than that,\" he said.\n\nCannupa Hanska Luger: Every One & Kali Spitzer: Sister will be on display at the Gardiner Museum until Jan. 12, 2020.", "description": "Cannupa Hanska Luger: Every One & Kali Spitzer: Sister is made up of over 4,000 massive clay beads that were handmade by communities around Canada and the United States, as a visual representation of data estimates of MMIWG.", "authors": ["Rhiannon Johnson Is An Anishinaabe Journalist Hiawatha First Nation Based In Toronto.
