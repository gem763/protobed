Hoeven made the disclosures in a form he filed with the Secretary of the Senate on Sept. 25.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, Hoeven\u2019s office provided the statement: \u201cSenator Hoeven\u2019s stock trades were made in consultation with his financial advisers and in accordance with Senate regulations and reporting requirements.\u201d\n\nHoeven bought $50,001 to $100,000 of Netflix stock on Sept. 24. Specific values aren\u2019t required for disclosure, only ranges. The senator\u2019s 2018 disclosure form shows that he didn\u2019t own any shares of the videostreaming giant at the end of that year.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nNetflix\u2019s stock has had a reversal of fortune this year. After logging a 39.4% rise last year, shares continued surging, setting a 2019 intraday high of $385.99 on May 1, representing a year-to-date gain at that point of 44.2%. But fears of rival services from Walt Disney (DIS) and Apple (AAPL) and a setback in subscriber numbers have hammered Netflix\u2019s stock since. Shares now sport a loss of 1.7% so far this year. By comparison, the S&P 500 sports a year-to-date rise of 18.1%. We noted that at least one analyst is bullish on Netflix stock, although we have our doubts.\n\nHoeven bought $15,001 to $50,000 of Kontoor stock on Sept. 24. Kontoor, which spun off from VF (VFC) this past May, owns the Wrangler and Lee brands of jeans. VF shareholders received one Kontoor share for every seven VF shares they owned.\n\nHoeven is adding to his Kontoor position with the purchase. He owned VF stock valued between $250,001 and $500,000 at the end of 2018, and he hasn\u2019t sold any since.\n\nKontoor stock closed at $38.60 on May 23, its first day of trading publicly after the distribution. Shares have slipped since, closing at $34.52 on Friday.\n\nInside Scoop is a regular Barron\u2019s feature covering stock transactions by corporate executives and board members\u2014so-called insiders\u2014as well as large shareholders, politicians, and other prominent figures.
