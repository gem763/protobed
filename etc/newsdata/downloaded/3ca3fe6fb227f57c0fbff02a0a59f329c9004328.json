This sector includes everything from postal workers and pilots to public-transportation employees and truck drivers.\n\nOther industries that experienced notable increases included wholesale trade (20%), retail trade (14.9%) and construction (13.2%).\n\nRetail trade had the highest rate of workforce tests that came back positive for drug use, at 5.4% in 2018. That\u2019s higher than the national rate of 5.1%.\n\nRead more: America\u2019s pot obsession challenges another great love \u2014 driving cars\n\n\u201cDrug use by the nation\u2019s workforce is growing across a broad swath of industries,\u201d Barry Sample, senior director of science and technology at Quest Diagnostics DGX, -0.59% , said in the report.\n\n\u201cOf particular concern are sharp jumps in positivity rates seen in sectors like transportation and warehousing and construction that directly affect public safety,\u201d Sample said. \u201cStaying vigilant and providing support for employees who test positive for drug use are key for employers seeking to maintain a safe, healthy workforce.\u201d\n\nMarijuana use is particularly becoming a concern\n\nMarijuana was the most commonly detected drug in most sectors. The rates of positive tests for marijuana increased by double-digits for eight of the 17 sectors studied, including transportation and warehousing (up 53.3%), mining (up 50%), construction (up 46.7%) and manufacturing (up 38.5%).\n\nThe sector that displayed the highest rate of marijuana use among its workers, accommodation and food services, actually experienced the largest decline in failed drug tests over the time period analyzed, with a 17.3% drop.\n\n\u2018Of particular concern are sharp jumps in positivity rates seen in sectors like transportation and warehousing and construction that directly affect public safety.\u2019 \u2014Barry Sample, senior director of science and technology at Quest Diagnostics\n\nWhether cannabis legalization has an effect on failed drug tests depends on the state. In areas where medical marijuana has been legalized, there was not an uptick in the number of failed drug tests. This, Sample said, is a reflection of the fact that these laws are very carefully written to make it difficult to access medical marijuana.\n\nBut as marijuana use increases, employers may need to become more savvy when it comes to the drug-testing methods to ensure that workers aren\u2019t putting the public\u2019s safety (and their own) at risk. For people who consume cannabis infrequently, urine samples will only be positive for THC (the main drug in marijuana) for between one and three days. That timeline lengthens to over a month for regular or heavy cannabis users.\n\nAlso see: The U.S. isn\u2019t building enough houses \u2014 and that\u2019s not changing anytime soon, economists say\n\nComparatively, blood tests for THC can detect traces of the chemical up to 75 days after ingesting marijuana, while hair follicle tests can confirm cannabis use up to 90 days afterward.\n\nMarijuana use has become a particular concern when it comes to driving. Contrary to what many think, marijuana is just as dangerous as alcohol in terms of impairing a driver\u2019s abilities, and it is the illicit drug most frequently found in the blood of drivers involved in crashes, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nShares of Quest are up 4.41% over the past three months. That\u2019s roughly in line with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.85% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.72% , which are up 3.88% and 3.96% over that same period.\n\nQuentin Fottrell contributed to this story.", "description": "A higher percentage of people nationwide tested positive for a controlled substance in 2018 than in previous years.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR106_truckd_ZG_20190911130032.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
