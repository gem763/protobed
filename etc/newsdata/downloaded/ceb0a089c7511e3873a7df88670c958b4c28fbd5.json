(Picture: BBC)\n\nWe find out more about Ric (Hugh Quarshie)\u2019s health issues in tonight\u2019s Holby City \u2013 and it\u2019s not good news. He insists on keeping the truth from Darla (Naomi Katiyo), because it\u2019s the day she has to give up her baby for adoption \u2013 but on Holby these things have a way of coming out. And as Ric contemplates his own mortality, Darla has a visitor.\n\nMeanwhile Essie (Kaye Wragg) also has a visitor, when Isla\u2019s father Connor (Calum Lill) turns up looking for Frankie. How much trouble will he stir up for Essie? And to make a trio of surprise visitors, Kian (Ramin Karimloo) is shocked when he recognises a patient. Here are all the spoilers to look out for.\n\n1. As we learned at the end of last week\u2019s episode, Ric Griffin has a brain tumour. And this week he discovers it\u2019s a big one, so any surgery would carry massively high risks. Ric is determined to keep all of this from his granddaughter Darla, as it\u2019s the day when her baby is due to be taken into foster care before she\u2019s adopted. Some of his colleagues think Ric should be honest with Darla. Will he be convinced?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. There\u2019s a little party for Essie to celebrate her \u2018adoption\u2019 of baby Isla. The only person who\u2019s in on the secret that the baby isn\u2019t legally Essie\u2019s is Sacha (Bob Barrett), and he\u2019s determined to support her.\n\nA nasty surprise for Essie (Picture: BBC)\n\n3. Cameron (Nic Jackman) isn\u2019t coping very well with his guilty secret about Evan and is constantly on edge. Can he hold it together when he has to produce a report about what happened?\n\n4. Essie is shocked by a visit from Isla\u2019s father, Connor. He\u2019s come to the hospital looking for Frankie, but Essie\u2019s defensive attitude makes him suspicious. How will Essie deal with the situation? Is her secret about to be revealed?\n\n5. An attractive patient on Darwin is a very familiar face to Kian and he makes sure she gets the best service Darwin can offer. Is an old flame about to be rekindled?\n\nIs this entirely professional? (Picture: BBC)\n\n6. Sacha is excited because he has a ground-breaking procedure to perform \u2013 but his theatre nurse, Essie, seems oddly distracted. Can he get to the bottom of what\u2019s worrying her?\n\n7. Ric isn\u2019t impressed when the father of Darla\u2019s baby comes to see her and tempers flare. But as Darla is faced with the heartbreak of having to say goodbye to her daughter, is Ric really doing what\u2019s in Darla\u2019s best interests by hiding his diagnosis from her?\n\nSue Haasler is the author of the official Holby City book, which you can read about here.
