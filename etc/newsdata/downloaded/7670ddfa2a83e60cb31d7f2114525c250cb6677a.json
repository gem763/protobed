His head collided with the forward\u2019s knee and he was taken off for a head assessment that he failed.\n\nWarren Gatland said after the match: \u201cHe will be fine for the flight.

From then on, the governing body has the power to order an independent assessment before a player who has suffered concussion is cleared to play again.
