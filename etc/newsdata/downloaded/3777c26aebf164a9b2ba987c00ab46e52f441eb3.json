REUTERS/James Lawler Duggan\n\nKuroda also said the BOJ already has a flexible framework that allows it to accelerate purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETF) if markets become volatile, signalling its readiness to moderate stock price falls that could hurt business sentiment.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, the world economic outlook ... has become less buoyant. And the timing of (pick-up) of world economic growth has been somewhat delayed,\u201d Kuroda told Reuters, adding that risks continue to be \u201cfairly high.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we need further easing of monetary conditions, we would certainly reduce short- to medium-term interest rates. But we don\u2019t want to reduce super-long interest rates,\u201d he said on Saturday after attending the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank meetings.\n\nThe remarks underscore the BOJ\u2019s concern over the pain the bitter U.S.-China trade war and slumping global demand are inflicting on the export-reliant economy, which could prod it to ramp up monetary stimulus as early as this month.\n\nThey are also the strongest signal to date from Kuroda that if the BOJ were to ease, the most likely step would be to push its short-term rate target deeper into negative territory.\n\nReducing short- and medium-term rates would have a \u201cpositive\u201d impact on the economy, while excessive cuts in super- long yields could hurt consumer sentiment by eroding investment returns for pension funds and life insurers, he said.\n\nUnder a policy dubbed yield curve control (YCC), the BOJ guides short-term rates at -0.1% and 10-year bond yields around 0% in an effort to achieve its elusive 2% inflation target. It also buys government bonds and risky assets such as ETFs.\n\nMORE EASING STILL EFFECTIVE\n\nMarkets are rife with speculation the BOJ could ease at its Oct. 30-31 meeting, after it signalled last month the chance of imminent action by warning of escalating overseas risks.\n\nWhen asked whether overseas risks remain high enough to warrant easing at that meeting, Kuroda said it was \u201ca bit difficult to say definitely.\u201d\n\nWhile U.S.-China trade talks have made some progress, the conflict may continue and the fate of Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union remains uncertain, he said.\n\nSuch overseas risks and cuts in the International Monetary Funds\u2019 global growth forecast would affect the BOJ\u2019s projections on Japan\u2019s economic prospects, he added.\n\nWhile repeating that the BOJ won\u2019t hesitate to ease if the economy\u2019s momentum towards achieving its 2% inflation target is weakened, Kuroda said he had no pre-set idea on when to act.\n\n\u201cWe have no predetermined policy decisions. It all depends on economic data,\u201d he said, suggesting an action this month was hardly a done deal. \u201cWe have to carefully watch, analyse global and domestic economic situations.\u201d\n\nThe BOJ has said it has four tools to ease - deepening negative rates, a cut in its long-term yield target, an increase in risky asset buying and an acceleration in money printing.\n\nWhile Kuroda has said deeper negative rates is among key options, analysts have warned the move could backfire by pushing regional banks into financial trouble and hurting consumer mood.\n\nWhen asked what other tools besides deeper negative rates the BOJ may opt for, Kuroda said the bank can \u201ccombine a few options\u201d or \u201cchange some aspects\u201d of them - without elaborating.\n\n\u201cWe can expand our asset purchase program. Our asset purchase program includes not just long-term government bonds but also ETFs,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are various tools to affect the economy by easing monetary conditions.\u201d\n\nThe BOJ pledges to buy ETFs so its holdings increase roughly 6 trillion yen ($55.34 billion) per year, but adds the pace of buying could fluctuate depending on market developments.\n\n\u201cOur ETF purchase is very flexible ... Even under the current asset purchase program, we can increase the ETF purchases significantly if needed,\u201d Kuroda said, suggesting the BOJ can vary the pace of buying even without changing its commitment to buy at the current rate of 6 trillion yen per year.\n\n\u201cAs far as the BOJ is concerned, we still have tools which could be used as necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the effect of monetary policy has declined.\u201d\n\n($1 = 108.4200 yen)", "description": "The Bank of Japan will \"certainly\" reduce short- to medium-term interest rates if it needed to ease monetary policy, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said, suggesting that deepening negative rates will be the primary tool to fight heightening overseas risks.", "authors": ["Leika Kihara", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1442831625&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J005", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
