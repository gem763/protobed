I just haven't been doing enough interviews, maybe?'\n\nPlaying dress-up: The couple's sons were dressed as a witch and dinosaur, among others\n\nUp next for busy mom Megan is three starring film roles.\n\nThe actress will join Gerard Butler, Ellen Page and Kate Winslet as Princess Leilani for the animated film, Naya Legend of the Golden Dolphin.\n\nMegan will work alongside Josh Duhamel in the family drama, Think Like a Dog, and Oscar Isaac, Andy Garcia and Lucy Hale in the comedic drama, Big Gold Brick.", "description": "Mothers everywhere can relate to her struggle.
