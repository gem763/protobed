That\u2019s broadening the appeal of a technology that allows vehicles to run on the universe\u2019s most abundant element, releasing only water and heat as byproducts.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a real change over the last 12 months,\u201d said Randy MacEwen, chief executive officer of Ballard, based in Burnaby just outside of Vancouver. In parts of Europe, operating a fuel cell-powered electric bus is now cost competitive with a traditional fuel-burning version, he says. Use of the technology is diversifying into ships, trains and forklifts.\n\nBallard is the second-best performing stock on Canada\u2019s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index this year, pushing its market value to $1.7 billion (US$1.3 billion). It\u2019s more than doubled after scoring a Chinese investor and burgeoning speculation that wide-scale adoption of hydrogen fuel cells may at long last be around the corner.\n\nA string of deals this year have indicated the technology is penetrating the traditional automotive industry:\n\nPower company Cummins Inc. \u2014 synonymous with the diesel engine for most of its century-old history \u2014 bought Canadian fuel-cell maker Hydrogenics Corp. for US$290 million in September.\n\nA truck maker controlled by Italy\u2019s billionaire Agnelli family, CNH Industrial NV, agreed to invest US$250 million in Nikola Motor, a startup aiming to put hydrogen semi-trucks on the road.\n\nRobert Bosch GmbH, the world\u2019s largest auto-parts supplier, in April announced plans to mass produce fuel cells by 2022 in partnership with Powercell Sweden AB.\n\n\u201cI think the understanding of the value proposition is much stronger today,\u201d says MacEwen, referring to the edge that hydrogen has particularly in commercial vehicles: refuelling with hydrogen is just as fast as filling up a truck or bus with diesel, while batteries can get too heavy when scaled up for larger vehicles.\n\nBallard believes it has around a 70 per cent to 80 per cent market share of the 3,000 fuel-cell buses and trucks currently deployed globally. It\u2019s focusing heavily on Europe where the cost of a fuel-cell bus has plunged to 375,000 euros (US$417,000) from about 1 million euros in five years. MacEwen expects a quarter of key European cities to deploy fuel-cell buses by 2025.\n\nChinese Investor\n\nThe company\u2019s stock price has also soared since a decision last year by China\u2019s Weichai Power Co., a major diesel-engine maker, to buy a 20 per cent stake in the company for US$163 million, making it Ballard\u2019s top shareholder. Robert Brown, an analyst at Lake Street Capital Markets in Minneapolis, called it a \u201cblockbuster deal\u201d that positions fuel-cell technology to further penetrate the world\u2019s biggest vehicle market.\n\nThat market could boom with growing government support: vehicle manufacturers, gas suppliers, and other private-sector institutions have announced more than US$17 billion in hydrogen fuel-cell investments as of June, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said in a report last month.\n\nChina plans to subsidize the large-scale deployment of hydrogen cars and invest in refueling infrastructure, seeking to replicate the cost reductions and economies of scale that have made the country the biggest market for electric vehicles, according to the BNEF report.\n\nReverse Engineering\n\nBallard\u2019s success in China is a bright spot at a time of dimming business prospects for Canadian companies in China. Canada-China relations have frayed since Canada\u2019s arrest on a U.S. extradition request of Huawei Technologies Co.\u2019s chief financial officer. Huawei has been at the centre of U.S. concerns about Chinese intellectual property theft and national security risks.\n\nBallard itself has seen would-be Chinese competitors trying to reverse engineer its fuel-cell technology, MacEwen says. \u201cI personally have seen a facility in China that looked very similar to ours.\u201d\n\nSo far the Chinese firms have only been able to make the technology work for a short period of time, he says. Ballard has buses in the field that have been operating for 35,000 hours \u2014 in contrast, the typical hydrogen fuel-cell powered passenger car is designed for just 5,000 hours of durability.\n\nLong Road\n\nThe company has kept control in Canada of its core technology \u2014 the membrane electrode assembly known as the heart of a fuel cell.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve invested over US$1 billion in our core intellectual property and so it\u2019s going to take someone a significant investment and a significant period of time in order to get to where we are today,\u201d he says. \u201cBy that time, of course, we\u2019ve moved the yardsticks on our technology.\u201d\n\nStill, skepticism over the technology remains, not least for the pumping infrastructure that would be required to build out the industry.\n\nAt the end of 2018, there were only about 10,000 passenger fuel cell vehicles on the road globally, according to BNEF, which doesn\u2019t expect the technology to gain any significant share of the passenger fleet over the next two decades. It does see a growing role for fuel cells in the long-haul, heavy-duty trucking area that Ballard focuses on, but says scaling up the required infrastructure and bringing down the cost of clean hydrogen production will mean that progress is slow.\n\nTesla Inc. founder Elon Musk has said hydrogen\u2019s shortcomings make it a dead-end for vehicles. \u201cFuel cells should be renamed \u2018fool cells,\u2019 he said in 2013.\n\nStock Overvalued?\n\nBallard has already been on a long road of unfulfilled potential. The company traces its roots back to 1979. During the tech boom in 2000 its shares approached $200 but it\u2019s never posted a profit. Analysts don\u2019t expect to see net income until 2022, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nRoth Capital Partners, based in Newport Beach, California, rates the company a sell. \u201cThe valuation in the stock has separated from the fundamental outlook, passing the highest peak made in the past 18 years, and does not seem to factor any risks related to business in China,\u201d Roth analyst Craig Irwin said in a recent report.\n\nMacEwen, undaunted, sees the company\u2019s losing streak coming to an end.\n\n\u201cThe growth trends look very attractive going forward.,\u201d he said. \u201cProfitability is coming into view.\u201d\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Ballard Power Systems has hung on for four decades without posting a profit, now it says its moment may finally be arriving", "authors": ["Natalie Obiko Pearson", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ballard.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
