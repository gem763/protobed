Nothing ruins an offensive play like a penetrating defensive lineman, and as the Kansas City Chief who slipped free \u2014 Derrick Nnadi \u2014 closed in on Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers on a third-and-1 at the Chiefs\u2019 3-yard line, Linsley rushed to recover, hoping he could do anything to prevent being the primary reason the play went bust.\n\nLinsley did not recover, as Nnadi proceeded to close on his quarterback unimpeded.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIt also didn\u2019t matter.\n\nAaron Rodgers added to his legend with a stunning 3-yard touchdown pass in a Sunday night victory against Kansas City. (USA TODAY Sports)\n\nA split-second before Rodgers was hit, the future Hall of Famer slung a side-arm heave \u2014 off his back foot \u2014 to the back right corner of the end zone. And as all eyes in the stadium zeroed in on the high-arcing spiral, one that initially looked to many like it may land harmlessly out of bounds, the low rumble of the crowd turned to gasps from Chiefs fans and cheers from Packers fans as the ball settled just beyond the outstretched fingertips of linebacker Ben Niemann and right into the grasp of running back Jamaal Williams for a stunning touchdown.\n\n\u201cI saw Jamaal catch it and I was like damn, that\u2019s a great catch, too,\u201d Linsley told Yahoo Sports with a laugh. \u201cIt was fantastic. The whole thing was great.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nFrankly, it was all about Rodgers\u2019 outrageous throw, one that gave the Packers a seven-point lead with nearly 14 minutes left. It also doubled as one of the greatest touchdown passes of Rodgers\u2019 career, one that fit into the tiniest of windows that left even his head coach stunned.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the best, if not the best, passes I\u2019ve ever seen live in person,\u201d said Packers coach Matt LaFleur, who thought Rodgers was trying to throw it away. \u201cThat was incredible. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Just a great play because he was under duress, too.\u201d\n\nIt was the epitome of greatness in one tidy eight-second highlight.\n\nLike why he\u2019s worth his record-setting $134 million contract.\n\nOr why he\u2019s worth sticking with, even after the drama that surfaced last year between he and former head coach Mike McCarthy.\n\nAnd finally, why he should be considered the odds-on favorite to win MVP for the resurgent 7-1 Packers. Rodgers, 35, is on pace to finish with 4,600 yards passing, 32 touchdowns and four interceptions, just one year after a miserable injury-plagued season in which he boasted a 25-2 touchdown-to-interception ratio but the Packers went 6-9-1.\n\nAnd rest assured, if Rodgers wins his second career MVP award in 2019, that throw will be at the epicenter of his campaign.\n\n\u201cMan, we\u2019re talking about a legendary quarterback making a legendary throw,\u201d Packers edge rusher Preston Smith explained afterward. \u201cIt\u2019s what we see all the time. I guess it\u2019s new to y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nSmith scoffed at the notion it was lucky, one that some fans were quick to jump on afterward \u2014 and one that Rodgers didn\u2019t completely disavow when explaining his thought process.\n\n\u201cAs I rolled to the right there, I saw Jimmy Graham and I saw [Williams] wrapping behind him,\u201d Rodgers explained. \u201cI was actually throwing a ball that Jimmy could go up and get if he wanted to and if he didn\u2019t, the guy behind him might be able to get. Luckily the guy behind him got it \u2026 It seemed like there was not anybody in the back of the end zone, so I felt like it was a safe throw.\u201d\n\nAnd when told that Williams, a third-year pro, said he \u201clocked eyes with Rodgers\u201d on the throw, Rodgers seemed amused.\n\n\u201cI did see him if that is what he is talking about \u2014 I am not sure if we locked eyes,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cThat might be a little bit of a stretch, but I did see him. Wind probably helped out on that one.\u201d\n\nSo was there a little luck involved? Sure. Does it matter? Probably not.\n\nEven with a sprinkle of good fortune, it\u2019s obvious that only a handful of quarterbacks in the past two decades could have gotten the ball to that spot and his teammates are well aware of this fact.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a special player \u2014 he can do things like that,\u201d Williams explained. \u201cHe\u2019s got a great IQ. He\u2019s got a great feel for the game. I\u2019m just grateful to be able to play with a guy like this who gives us opportunities to keep on playing.\u201d\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s what matters most. His teammates believe in his ability to do the impossible, because he makes them believe in his legend, too.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the youngsters like Williams who are convinced of it. When asked where the throw ranked in the pantheon of Great Rodgers Throws, Linsley \u2014 who has been around Rodgers a while \u2014 shook his head and thought about it for a second before conceding it was great, but insisting there are lots of other great throws to choose from, too.\n\n\u201cI would say that\u2019s top five, maybe, especially [with it being] Sunday Night Football,\u201d Linsley told Yahoo Sports. \u201cThat\u2019s good s---, though.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "It was the epitome of greatness.
