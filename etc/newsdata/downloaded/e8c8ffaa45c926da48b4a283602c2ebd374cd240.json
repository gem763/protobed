The numbers assume a 5% return on investments and a 4% withdrawal rate once you reach financial independence.\n\nFor instance, someone earning after-tax dollars of $40,000 and spending $30,000 a year will have to wait 31.9 years to gain FIRE. In other words, if you have $10,000 left over to invest every year, and get that 5% return, it\u2019ll take that long before you have enough money to withdraw 4% of your portfolio without running out of cash.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t go beyond $100,000, but you get the idea.\n\n\u201cIf you can earn $90,000 per year and only spend $20,000 you only need to work for 6 years to have enough money to support you for the rest of your life,\u201d Zach wrote. \u201cBut if you earn $90,000 and are spending $85,000 it will take you over 60 years to retire.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that the most relevant spot in the grid is in the $40,000 to $60,000 range, where most earners find themselves.\n\n\u201cIf you earn $50,000 per year and you are spending $40,000 per year, it will take you about 36 years to reach financial independence,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you can cut your spending to $30,000 per year you would reach financial independence in 21 years.\u201d\n\nBut what if investment returns are up at a gaudy 15%, like they were in recent years? That unlikely figure probably has a lot to do with the increasing popularity of FIRE, particularly among millennials, who haven\u2019t suffered through previous bear markets. The whole concept seems a lot more achievable when your portfolio is popping... when stocks are tanking -- as they have been in December, well, some are anticipating a painful unwinding of the entire FIRE movement.\n\nAt any rate, Zach created another chart to reflect a 15% return:\n\nAs you can see, the earner waiting almost 32 years to reach FIRE in the first scenario can get it down to less than 18 with those returns, Of course, counting on those kinds of numbers going forward may be a stretch \u2014 a BIG stretch \u2014 so it\u2019s best to take aim at the factors that you can do something about.\n\n\u201cThis means focusing on increasing your income, keeping your spending in check, minimizing investment fees, and maintaining an asset allocation that aligns with your financial goals,\u201d Zach explained. \u201cIf you hope to achieve financial independence in a relatively short period of time, you\u2019ll likely be better off focusing on these variables.\u201d", "description": "There are lots of moving parts to the FIRE movement, but one crucial step toward achieving that coveted status is as easy to understand as it is difficult to...", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HA027_sunset_ZG_20181210135834.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-10"}
