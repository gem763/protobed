So to nip it in the bud some have taken to having a quiet word with some guests awaiting an audience with the queen.\n\n\u201cThey suggested that questions around Harry and Meghan may not be the best choice as a topic of polite conversation. Naturally it\u2019s informal rather than any official policy and there\u2019s no suggestion the queen is even aware.\u201d\n\nWhile official sources sought to play down the reports, telling the Sun that the \u201cveracity\u201d of the story was questionable, there is in fact a well-established tradition of courtiers quietly hinting appropriate conversational topics to visitors to the queen (and Prince Charles, who is known to dislike being contradicted) as well as briefing visitors on some of the more arcane points of regal etiquette (you don\u2019t turn your back on the monarch, for example, and all women are expected to curtsy to the queen).\n\nOne of the most famous dramatic interpretations of this custom is the scene in the Peter Morgan-penned film The Queen, which sees new Prime Minister Tony Blair receiving a brief and quick-fire run-down of what to do and what not to do before he goes in to see the queen after winning the election.\n\nHowever the briefing is incomplete: Blair kneels before her and is about to ask her permission to form a government when the queen, played by Helen Mirren, interrupts him to say, \u201cNo, I ask.\u201d", "description": "A subject invited to ride out with H.M. was advised not to mention the Sussexes.
