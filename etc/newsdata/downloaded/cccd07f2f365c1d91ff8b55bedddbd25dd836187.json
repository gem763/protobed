We love your love, spirit and graciousness. You lift us up. With kind thankfulness, the people of upstate New York.\"\n\nA close look at the message printed on the chocolate bar wrappers. (Submitted)\n\nSchaefer said since getting off the ferry in Port aux Basques on Aug. 20, their interactions while travelling around the island have been moving.\n\n\"It's been overwhelming. People are just so excited to get that candy bar \u2014 it's almost like we're giving them a hundred dollars,\" she said. \"They just, they can't believe it. They're very humble people.\"\n\nEven better than the musical\n\nDriving across in their RV, Freese and Schaefer have been taking in the sights, hiking trails and coastline \u2014 from Gros Morne, to L'Anse aux Meadows, to Twillingate and Fogo Island.\n\nThe real thing hasn't disappointed, Schaefer said.\n\n\"I think these people are even better, and even nicer, than in the play,\" she said.\n\n\"I mean, the play \u2014 don't get me wrong \u2014 they're amazing people, but to experience it ourselves is just, it's just overwhelming for us.\"\n\nThe couple has been taken out in a boat by locals they've met, invited to shed parties, breakfasts, dinners and all kinds of other events.\n\n\"We spent the night in Ship Cove and met two ladies. They were having their evening walk. We gave them both candy bars, and a few minutes later the lady's husband showed up with his car and said, 'My wife said you were looking for moose,'\" Freese said.\n\nFreese and Schaefer have been enjoying not just the people, but the scenic spots during their travels across Newfoundland and Labrador. (Submitted)\n\n\"So he took us for a half-hour ride up and down the road there, looking for moose,\" he added.\n\n\"We just had a great time. And yes, he got a candy bar too. People that we know just don't do that and we should. It's just a fun and warm and generous thing to do.\"\n\nThe couple are still traversing the island, covering ground in their camper and handing out dozens of chocolate bars along the way.\n\nBut they're really looking forward to heading to the towns featured in Come From Away \u2014 Gander and Appleton, for example \u2014 on the anniversary of 9/11, to take part in remembrance ceremonies, where they plan to give out the bulk of their bars.\n\nIn the meantime, Freese said he and Schaefer are feeling at home in Newfoundland and Labrador, and it's a trip they won't soon forget.\n\n\"The people of Newfoundland, you guys are the real thing \u2014 you're the real deal. You are just so gracious and loving and caring and helpful. We need to help the rest of the world be like you,\" Freese said.\n\n\"Thank you to all the people of Newfoundland for just the way you are, because the way you are is the way all of us should be.\"\n\nRead more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "description": "Bob Freese and Peg Schaefer are vacationing in Newfoundland and Labrador, but it's not just a holiday for the couple from Rochester, N.Y. \u2014\u00a0it's more of a pilgrimage.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5269583.1567591603!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/chocolate-bar-thank-yous.jpg"}
