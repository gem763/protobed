After all, I was the one that had the good credit and a high income,\" she said.\n\nEllen narrowly escaped with her life after a particularly rough evening of heavy drinking, during which her abuser began turning her house, which she had paid for herself, upside down.\n\n\"It continued to escalate, coming to a head in the middle of the night when I was awakened by the sound of him trashing my house before he came after me with a kitchen knife,\" she said. \"I fought back, called the police, and luckily I lived to tell the story.\"\n\nEllen's experience is not uncommon. Abusers often destroy their victim's economic independence in order to control them and make it financially difficult to leave. And the repercussions of financial abuse can continue to follow those who break free of their abusers. But there are organisations out there that offer help - and in the US in October, they have been ramping up their outreach efforts as the country marks National Domestic Violence Awareness Month.\n\nFinancial abuse is a situation that the US legal system still does not quite know how to handle. A study last year by the Institute for Women's Policy Research shows that the consequences of financial abuse are not the main priority when addressing the safety and wellbeing of victims.\n\n\"Why are there statutes on financial abuse, but attorneys and judges don't care?\" asked one survivor who was interviewed for the study. \"They say the last person in court had their face smashed in, so financial abuse isn't a big deal. [But] it is the precursor!\"\n\nSigns of real trouble\n\nFinancial abuse is a hidden threat in almost all domestic violence situations, but knowing the signs can empower people from all walks of life to be on guard.\n\nBarring victims from making their own money - also known as \"cutting the line\" - is one of the most obvious signs. Other tactics abusers commonly use include making it difficult for victims to hold down a job, attend job interviews or seek job training; destroying their victim's credit; controlling access to bank accounts and other financial instruments; putting victims on a restrictive \"allowance\"; identity theft and even withholding child support.\n\nKim Pentico, director of the Economic Justice Program at the National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV), said the array of abuse can leave victims navigating a morass of negative financial impacts.\n\n\"It's so tricky and pervasive, and it's invisible most of the time,\" said Pentico.\n\nNNEDV also works on public policy, such as chronicling the prevalence of financial abuse, informing the US Congress about it through reports and surveys, and advocating for victims on key issues, especially housing.\n\n\"We do economic justice work and general capacity building ... we provide training and technical assistance,\" Pentico said.\n\nThat training enabled Ellen to rebuild her financial life, one transaction at a time.\n\nFighting for empowerment\n\nThe lingering effects of financial abuse continued to plague Ellen as she left her abuser.\n\n\"My credit was ruined, I had huge debt, and zero income,\" she said. \"Eventually, I had to do things I never thought would be necessary, like declare bankruptcy, default on student loans, use food stamps and apply for Medicaid.\"\n\nStarting from scratch was not easy. But Ellen got back on her feet with help from nonprofit programmes such as NNEDV and the Allstate Foundation Purple Purse, which has provided over 1.7 million financial abuse victims with job training, small business help and financial education.\n\nAnother programme, People's Place, gave her training and educational support.\n\n\"After taking the Allstate Foundation's Moving Ahead Curriculum and working with my advocate Holly from People's Place, I have restored my credit,\" Ellen said.\n\n\"The curriculum is a comprehensive financial lesson plan designed to empower survivors to become financially independent,\" Allstate Foundation Senior Program Officer Ellen Lisak told Al Jazeera.\n\nUS tennis champion Serena Williams, among others, has worked with the Allstate Foundation to educate the public about the warning signs of financial abuse.\n\nBut the struggle to combat the problem is still an uphill battle. Purple Purse has found that 78 percent of people do not know financial abuse is real.\n\nAccording to Pentico, traditional views on gender roles are also a barrier to education and awareness.\n\nMoving on\n\nYears of financial and emotional abuse taught Ellen about the power of reaching out, building connections, making a plan, and mustering the courage to take the first step to leave.\n\nShe advises victims and survivors to take control of their futures in several ways.\n\n\"It's still difficult for me to trust. I learned to look hard and look twice before getting into a dating relationship. I learned to ask questions, look for signs, take the flags seriously, and set firm boundaries,\" Ellen said.\n\n\"Luckily, I am now ready to move on with someone who gets it.\"\n\nEllen believes anyone can survive financial abuse with the right help.\n\n\"You're stronger than you think,\" she says. \"And more importantly, you're worth it.\"", "description": "Manipulation around money issues often plays an outsized role in abusive and violent family situations.", "authors": ["Stacey Tisdale", "About The Author"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/2/d66f218b4cc74e9180743d4036060c10_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
