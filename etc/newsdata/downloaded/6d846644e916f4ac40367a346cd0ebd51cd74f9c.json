It\u2019s another example of the real-world complications that arise from Tesla\u2019s willingness to beta test features using customers.\n\nSmart Summon is the new name for Tesla\u2019s autonomous parking feature, which enables a Tesla vehicle to leave a parking space and navigate around obstacles to its owner. Tesla owners who purchased the Full Self-Driving option on their car received it as part of the version 10 software update that went out last week. Using just a smartphone, you can \u201csummon\u201d your car to you from a maximum distance of 200 feet, as long as the car is within your line of sight.\n\nVideos of Tesla owners testing the new feature have already began popping up on social media over the weekend, and wouldn\u2019t you know it, it\u2019s kind of a mess. One Tesla owner tweeted about \u201cfront bumper damage,\u201d while another claimed their Model 3 \u201cran into the side of [a] garage.\u201d A video of a near collision with a speeding SUV left the owner feeling their test of Smart Summon \u201cdidn\u2019t go so well.\u201d Another Tesla was filmed seemingly confused by pedestrians and other cars as it tried to make its way across a Walmart parking lot.\n\nTesla warns owners to be careful with using Smart Summon because it\u2019s not a fully autonomous feature. \u201cYou are still responsible for your car and must monitor it and its surroundings at all times and be within your line of sight because it may not detect all obstacles,\u201d the fine print on Tesla\u2019s website reads. \u201cBe especially careful around quick moving people, bicycles and cars.\u201d\n\nSoday 1 with V10 Smart Summon was working beautifully. But someone didn\u2019t notice my M3 and made a front bumper damage. We will claim our insurances but who\u2019s fault do you guys think it\u2019ll be ?

Supporters accuse the Tesla owners of misusing the feature \u2014 they\u2019re \u201cdoing some dumb things with it,\u201d according to Electrek \u2014 or even lying about what actually happened, while the shorts have their own theories about how all this could possibly relate to the company\u2019s upcoming earnings report.\n\nThis feels like a tiny glimpse of the chaotic future\n\nThis feels like a tiny glimpse of the chaotic future. Amid flagging auto sales, car companies are introducing more and more futuristic-seeming functions in their production vehicles. This includes advanced driver assist systems, like Tesla\u2019s Autopilot and GM\u2019s Super Cruise, and other features that take advantage of the suite of cameras and sensors that come embedded in practically every modern car today. Tesla is obviously ahead of the pack. Their competitors are rushing to keep up.\n\nThe result will be a messy scrum of \u201csmart\u201d and \u201cdumb\u201d cars interacting with each other in ways that are both hilarious and potentially dangerous \u2014 especially when the smart cars aren\u2019t as smart as advertised. Either way, these interactions are tailor-made to go viral.\n\nThis weekend\u2019s video bonanza is just the beginning \u2014 and they\u2019re likely to shape some of the public\u2019s perception of autonomous vehicles as janky and prone to mistakes. You could place them in the same category as the \u201cTesla driver sleeping while driving on the highway\u201d genre of YouTube videos that have been circulating for years now. The takeaway is that the more people get to experience autonomy in their real lives, the less plausible it seems.", "description": "Tesla\u2019s new \"Smart Summon\" feature is already causing confusion \u2014 and some minor fender benders.
