Five percent stated they were undecided on the matter.\n\nThe poll comes as House Democrats are attempting to move expeditiously with an impeachment inquiry against President Trump over a partisan CIA officer mischaracterization the president\u2019s summer telephone call with the leader of Ukraine in a so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint. Both the credibility of the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d and his complaint have come in question as the officer was revealed as a registered Democrat with a previous \u201cprofessional relationship\u201d with a Democratic presidential candidate, while his accusations are based on secondhand information.\n\nHis chief claim is that President Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into allegations of corruption against former Vice President and White House hopeful Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Both President Trump and Zelensky have vehemently denied any pressured was applied and the White House released a transcript of their call to illustrate no wrongdoing occurred.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, questions regarding the Biden family\u2019s activities in Ukraine and China continue to swirl:\n\nIn recent days, President Donald Trump has suggested China and Ukraine investigate alleged corruption committed by the Biden family. As Breitbart News extensively reported, Hunter Biden\u2019s investment company scored a $1.5 billion investment deal with the Bank of China after traveling with his father on Air Force Two to the country in 2013. Further, then-vice president Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating the gas giant Burisma Holdings, which was paying Hunter Biden $83,000 monthly as a member of its board, despite his lack of expertise in the energy sector. Biden later boasted before the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired.\n\nThe Fox News poll found 43 percent support the notion that President Trump\u2019s comments during the July 25th call with Zelensky were impeachable and 27 percent say that while they were inappropriate, they were not impeachable. Only 17 percent stated his comments were appropriate.\n\nThe poll surveyed 1,003 registered voters and was conducted by telephone between October 6th-8th.", "description": "A Fox News poll published Wednesday shows a record 51 percent of respondents support the impeachment and removal of President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-513617704-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
