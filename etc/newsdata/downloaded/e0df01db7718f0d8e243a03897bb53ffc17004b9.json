We have to preserve the health and the safety of our citizens.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, foreign secretary Dominic Raab rejected any suggestion that Northern Ireland could have different customs and regulatory arrangements from the rest of the UK, telling BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \u201cAs a general overarching [arrangement] across all of the rules, no, of course that would be wrong.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere couldn\u2019t be a Northern Ireland-only backstop in its entirety in the way it was proposed previously. But on agri-food, and the question of the way the island of Ireland is already managed, that is something in a very discrete area where we can continue talking. But it must have the consent of the parties in Northern Ireland.\u201d\n\nMr Raab said he was \u201cconfident there\u2019s a deal to be done\u201d and insisted the UK was making \u201cgood progress\u201d in talks.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s necessary now is for the EU to match some of the words that we heard from Jean-Claude Juncker with the detailed negotiations to remove the undemocratic backstop, to be clear we can transition to a best-in-class free trade agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that would be good for the UK but also for the EU.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Sometimes I have to question that some people are forgetting about the history.\u201d\n\nThe senior Brussels official also sought to blame the UK for any fallout caused by a no-deal Brexit, amid frustration in EU circles over perceived attempts from the UK government to shift responsibility away from London.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe EU is in no way responsible for any kind of consequences entailed by the Brexit.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a British decision, a sovereign decision that we are respecting but don\u2019t try... not you but to charge the European Union with the responsibility.\n\n\u201cThe European Union is not leaving the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union.\u201d\n\nAsked who is responsible, he said: \u201cThe United Kingdom. Because we did not invent the Brexit.\n\n\u201cWe were never pleading in favour of any kind of Brexit. That\u2019s a British decision and so it has to be dealt with in that way.\u201d\n\nHis comments came after a meeting with Mr Johnson in Luxembourg last week, when the country\u2019s prime minister Xavier Bettel left an empty podium for his UK counterpart at a press conference.\n\nMr Juncker said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is helpful. I rather consider that this was not very helpful but it\u2019s his decision.\u201d", "description": "Jean-Claude Juncker has warned there will have to be controls at the border in Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
