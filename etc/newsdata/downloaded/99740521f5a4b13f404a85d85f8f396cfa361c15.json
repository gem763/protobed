REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth/File Photo\n\nThe bank said it was still wading through more than two million claims or requests for PPI information at the end of the third quarter and could not be certain the provision it had taken would be final, saying it would have a better idea at the end of the year.\n\nBritish banks were stung by a late surge in PPI queries ahead of an August claims deadline, sending the industry\u2019s final compensation bill above \u00a343 billion.\n\nRoyal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) on Thursday fell to a third quarter loss due to a \u00a3900 million PPI charge and a weak performance in investment banking.", "description": "Britain's Barclays said a worsening global economic outlook means it may be hard to meet its profit targets, despite reporting better-than-expected results at its under-pressure investment bank in the third quarter.", "authors": ["Lawrence White", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444758093&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O0BW", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
