They also conceded three against Romania in 2011, as well as versus Uruguay in 2015.\n\nPool C: England 45 United States 7\n\nEddie Jones\u2019 men came close to recording their first World Cup whitewash with a seven-try performance against the US, but Bryce Campbell scored for the Eagles after the final gong, with the Americans having been reduced to 14 men thanks to John Quill\u2019s red card for a shoulder to the head of Owen Farrell.\n\nKey stat: This was the first time since 1995 that England had kept their opponents scoreless in the first half of a World Cup match.\n\nJoe Cokanasiga touched down twice for England against USA (Adam Davy/PA)\n\nPool C: England 39 Argentina 10\n\nThe Pumas had Tomas Lavanini sent off for another shoulder to Farrell\u2019s head inside the opening 20 minutes, making England\u2019s job easier in what should have been their toughest test of the World Cup to that point. The 2003 champions\u2019 final Pool C clash with France was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis, which saw them top the group by two points from Les Bleus.\n\nKey stat: England became the first team to claim a place in the quarter-finals with this victory.\n\nArgentina had Tomas Lavanini sent off (Ashley Western/PA)\n\nQuarter-final: England 40 Australia 16\n\nJonny May crossed for two of England\u2019s four tries as he collected his 50th cap, with Jones\u2019 side racking up the most points the Wallabies had conceded in a World Cup fixture. The win in Oita set up a semi-final clash with champions New Zealand and prompted Wallabies coach Michael Cheika to stand down.\n\nKey stat: Owen Farrell\u2019s 20 points were the most by an England captain in a World Cup match, beating the previous record of 17 by Rob Andrew against Italy in 1995.\n\nSemi-final: England 19 New Zealand 7\n\nEngland stormed into a 10-0 lead as Manu Tuilagi\u2019s second-minute try and a long-range penalty from George Ford rewarded a dominant first half. Ford added another penalty before All Blacks flanker Ardie Savea pounced on a wayward line-out throw to reduce the deficit to 13-7. But England held their nerve and Ford slotted another two penalties to defeat the three-time world champions.\n\nKey stat: England\u2019s 16 turnovers were the most by any side at this year\u2019s World Cup and equalled their own record at the tournament.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nPool B: South Africa 13 New Zealand 23\n\nSouth Africa faced a daunting start to the competition with a pool opener against New Zealand. Though the match never quite lived up to the hype, two tries in three first-half minutes from George Bridge and Scott Barrett put the All Blacks in command. Pieter-Steph du Toit\u2019s try and a Handre Pollard drop-goal made it tense but two penalties saw the All Blacks home.\n\nKey stat: This was the first time in five All Blacks-Springboks games that the score was settled by more than two points.\n\nPool B: South Africa 57 Namibia 3\n\nSouth Africa ran in nine tries to overwhelm their African neighbours Namibia. Hooker Mbongeni Mbonambi ploughed over for two tries as the Springboks built a 28-point lead by the interval. There was no let-up after the break with Warrick Gelant going over before scores for Makazole Mapimpi, Siya Kolisi and Schalk Brits.\n\nKey stat: Former Saracens star Brits, the 38-year-old hooker, lined up in the back-row, reprising a number eight role he last played a decade ago.\n\nSouth Africa hooker Schalk Brits (right) lined up at number eight against Namibia (Adam Davy/PA)\n\nPool B: South Africa 49 Italy 3\n\nItaly were punished as prop Andrea Lovotti was sent off for a tip-tackle. Handre Pollard converted tries from Cheslin Kolbe and Mbongeni Mbonambi, and added a penalty as the Springboks opened up a 17-3 interval lead. Lovotti\u2019s dismissal opened the floodgates as Kolbe crossed for his second score and Lukhanyo Am, Makazole Mapimpi, RG Snyman and Malcolm Marx also went over.\n\nKey stat: Pollard became the highest points-scorer for the Springboks at the Rugby World Cup, surpassing Percy Montgomery\u2019s previous record.\n\nHandre Pollard is South Africa\u00b4s top points scorer in Rugby World Cup history (Ashley Western/PA)\n\nPool B: South Africa 66 Canada 7\n\nSouth Africa produced a dazzling first-half display with a big win over 14-man Canada. The Springboks ran in seven tries in the first half, with scrum-half Cobus Reinach notching the earliest hat-trick in a World Cup game after 20 minutes. Canada had Josh Larsen sent off for a charging into a ruck before half-time, and South Africa scored three more tries after the break.\n\nKey stat: Cobus Reinach scored the quickest hat-trick in World Cup history with three tries in the opening 20 minutes.\n\nSouth Africa\u00b4s Cobus Reinach (right) claimed a slice of World Cup history with a 20-minute hat-trick against Canada (Adam Davy/PA)\n\nQuarter-final: South Africa 26 Japan 3\n\nSouth Africa ended Japan\u2019s dream World Cup run by making their physicality count against the hosts. Makazole Mapimpi\u2019s try put the Springboks ahead, but Tendai Mtawarira was shown a yellow card for a tip tackle and Japan only trailed 5-3 at the break. Second-half tries from Faf De Klerk and Mapimpi plus Handre Pollard\u2019s 11 points put the Springboks out of reach\n\nKey stat: South Africa extended their record of winning all line-outs on their own throw at the 2019 World Cup. The Springboks won all 10 to take their tally to 57 out of 57 \u2013 the only side not to lose a line-out on their own throw.\n\nFaf de Klerk scores South Africa\u00b4s second try in their World Cup quarter-final win against Japan (Adam Davy/PA)\n\nSemi-final: South Africa 19 Wales 16\n\nHandre Pollard\u2019s 76th-minute penalty snatched victory for South Africa in a war of attrition against Wales. Three Pollard penalties gave them a 9-6 interval lead as the contest developed into a kicking battle. Dan Biggar levelled before Damian De Allende\u2019s burst put South Africa 16-9 ahead. Wales responded again with Josh Adams\u2019 converted try before Pollard proved the hero.\n\nKey stat: South Africa made 39 kicks, their most since the 2007 final win against England when they made 48.", "description": "The two nations meet in a re-run of 2007 World Cup final, which South Africa won 15-6.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/10/wire-20369948-1572432311-675_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
