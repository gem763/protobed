However, the Assembly also has an important role and special powers.\n\n\"We will consider using those powers immediately following the conclusion of the IOPC's work.\n\n\"Subject to that important review by the IOPC, certain people should be on notice that the Assembly may well be knocking on their door sometime soon.\"\n\nMeanwhile in Parliament Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan has told MPs her department is investigating if Ms Arcuri's Hacker House tech company had any UK-based staff.\n\nThe Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has paused a \u00a3100,000 grant to Hacker House after questions were raised about due diligence following reports of her relationship with Mr Johnson/\n\nMrs Morgan said she had not seen a copy of Hacker House's accounts or seen the initial application made by the US businesswoman.\n\nAsked about checks on whether the company had UK-based employees, she said: \"This is all the kind of thing that is part of the review and we said we would publish the review.\n\n\"We are looking at all the information we had.\"\n\nLast week Ms Arcuri refused seven times to deny that the pair\u2019s relationship was sexual but said she hadn't received any special treatment and denies wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cIt is really categorically no-one's business what private life we had or didn't have.\n\n\"But - and categorically more important - Boris never ever gave me favouritism\u201d\n\nMr Johnson has previously accused his \"old friends\" in the Assembly of \"barking up the wrong tree\" with their investigation and has denied any wrongdoing.", "description": "The London Assembly is 'pausing' its investigation into Boris Johnson and US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri, to allow a separate investigation by the IOPC to be carried out", "authors": ["Oliver Milne", "Image", "Paul Clarke", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20564588.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Innotech-Summit-26-April-2013.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
