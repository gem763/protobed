The committees specifically expressed interest in a July call between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as in calls and an in-person meeting between Mr. Giuliani and a top aide to the Ukrainian president.\n\n\u201cAs the 2020 election draws closer, President Trump and his personal attorney appear to have increased pressure on the Ukrainian government and its justice system in service of President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, and the White House and the State Department may be abetting this scheme,\u201d the chairmen of the committees wrote in letters to White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nThe White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The State Department referred questions to the White House.\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Giuliani said he had sought in the spring to meet with Mr. Zelensky\u2014who was at the time Ukraine\u2019s president-elect\u2014and planned a trip to Kiev to pressure the Ukrainian government to pursue two investigations: one into whether Ukraine, under its previous leader, had sought in 2016 to hurt the Trump campaign and bolster his opponent; and another into diplomatic efforts in the country by Joe Biden, the former vice president and Democratic presidential front-runner.\n\nMr. Giuliani\u2019s criticism of Mr. Biden centers on the then-vice president\u2019s efforts to seek the ouster of former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who had investigated a private Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Group, of which Mr. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, was a board member.\n\nMr. Giuliani has accused Mr. Biden of acting to protect his son, even though Mr. Shokin had already completed his investigation of Burisma Group before he left office. Mr. Biden has said he sought Mr. Shokin\u2019s ouster because he was not doing enough to investigate corruption.\n\nYuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine\u2019s current prosecutor general, told Bloomberg News in May he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Biden or his son.\n\n\u201cThis is beneath us as Americans,\u201d a Biden campaign spokesman said of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the former vice president.\n\nMr. Giuliani ultimately canceled his trip to Kiev after news of it was reported by the New York Times. \u201cWhat I was going to tell him was, we owe it to everyone to get these fully investigated,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. Of Mr. Trump, he added: \u201cIt was in the interest of my client that these be fully investigated.\u201d Mr. Trump was aware of his planned meeting, he said.\n\nMr. Giuliani disputed that there was any political motivation for his efforts. \u201cIt has nothing to do with taking Biden out as a presidential candidate,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m outraged by it as an American citizen.\u201d He said he would welcome an investigation into his efforts because it would raise the profile of corruption he says he has uncovered. But he said he would decline an invitation to testify before a \u201cridiculously hit-job Democratic committee\u201d and would instead hold a news conference in Washington.\n\nMr. Giuliani said he has spoken on several occasions since the canceled trip with Ukrainians including Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Mr. Zelensky. Mr. Giuliani met Mr. Yermak in Madrid in recent weeks and spoke to him as recently as two weeks ago, he said.\n\nMr. Yermak was \u201cvery receptive,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said of their conversation. \u201cHe wanted to assure me that President Zelensky was not going to be diverted from doing the right thing and get to the bottom of all this.\u201d\n\nMr. Giuliani said his discussions with Mr. Yermak were arranged in conjunction with the State Department and Kurt Volker, the State Department\u2019s special representative for Ukraine negotiations. He said the State Department gave his contact information to Mr. Yermak and briefed the State Department on their conversations.\n\nIn their letters to the White House and State Department, the congressional committees sought records related to any discussion of Ukrainian investigations, any communications with or referring to Mr. Giuliani and any documents related to the discussion of the possible suspension of security assistance to Ukraine. The administration in recent weeks has reviewed the status of those funds. Ukraine received $250 million in U.S. military aid this year.\n\nIf Mr. Trump \u201cis trying to pressure Ukraine into choosing between defending itself from Russian aggression without U.S. assistance or leveraging its judicial system to serve the ends of the Trump campaign, this would represent a staggering abuse of power,\u201d the chairmen of the committees wrote.\n\nThe committees also sought a transcript of and records related to a July call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky, in which Mr. Trump expressed support for the Ukrainian government investigating corruption cases related to the U.S.-Ukraine relationship, according to Mr. Zelensky\u2019s office.\n\nThe two leaders haven\u2019t met in person. Mr. Trump said last month he would invite Mr. Zelensky to the White House. Both leaders plan to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York City later this month.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be possible for the president to meet him and not talk about it,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said of the investigations he wants Ukraine to pursue. \u201cIt\u2019s on his mind. He certainly would like the answers.\u201d\n\nWrite to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com", "description": "Three House committees said they are investigating whether President Trump and his lawyer sought to pressure the Ukrainian government to pursue probes in an effort to benefit Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election bid.", "authors": ["Rebecca Ballhaus"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105433/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
