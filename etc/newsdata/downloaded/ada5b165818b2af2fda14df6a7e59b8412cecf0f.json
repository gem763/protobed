Add Iran as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Iran news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nIt is an extraordinary charge to make, that Iran used missiles and drones to attack its neighbor and rival Saudi Arabia, as the region teeters on the edge of high tensions.\n\nPresident Donald Trump warned the U.S. was \"locked and loaded\" to respond to the attack on Sunday, waiting for verification of who was responsible and for word from Saudi Arabia on how to proceed.\n\nThe Trump administration, in particular Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has blamed Iran for the attack since Saturday, but so far, there's been no public accusation that Iran launched missiles.\n\nThe Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen claimed responsibility for the assault, which hit one of the world's largest oil processing facilities, hundreds of miles from the Yemen-Saudi border, and sharply impacted global oil supplies.\n\nBut a senior U.S. official told ABC News Saturday that was false: \"It was Iran. The Houthis are claiming credit for something they did not do.\"\n\nPompeo tweeted that there was \"no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.\"\n\nHamad I Mohammed/Reuters\n\nThe attack on the Saudi state-owned oil company Aramco also included more than 20 drones, the official said.\n\nIran has denied responsibility for the attack, accusing Pompeo of \"max deceit,\" as the country's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted Saturday.\n\nIn a Sunday evening tweet, Trump did not share the definitive accusation against Iran, instead saying the U.S. had \"reason to believe that we know the culprit ... but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom [of Saudi Arabia] as to who they believe was the cause of this attack.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nThe senior official told ABC News the president is fully aware that Iran is responsible, but he wants the Saudis to acknowledge it if they want U.S. help.\n\nTrump promised the U.S. was \"locked and loaded depending on verification\" and waiting for the Saudis to say \"under what terms we would proceed!\"\n\nCritics condemned Trump's threat to act, especially at the Saudis' behest. Rep. Justin Amash, of Michigan, a former Republican and now Independent, tweeted, \"Under our Constitution, the power to commence war lies with Congress, not the president and certainly not Saudi Arabia. We don\u2019t take orders from foreign powers.\"\n\nUnder our Constitution, the power to commence war lies with Congress, not the president and certainly not Saudi Arabia.

Pompeo said Tuesday that Trump was \"prepared to meet with no preconditions.\"\n\nBut in a reversal Sunday, Trump tweeted it was \"incorrect\" to say he was willing to meet without conditions, blaming the \"fake news\" despite his repeated statements saying so.\n\nIn July 2018, the president first said \"no preconditions ... If they want to meet, I'll meet -- anytime they want.\"\n\nABC News' Conor Finnegan contributed to this report.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
