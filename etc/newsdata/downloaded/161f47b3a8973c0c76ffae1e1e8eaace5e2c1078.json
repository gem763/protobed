Adam Schiff. | Susan Walsh Congress Adam Schiff lashes Michael Flynn for refusing to cooperate\n\nFormer national security adviser Michael Flynn has refused to cooperate with the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s demand for testimony and documents, Chairman Adam Schiff wrote in a letter released Monday.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding repeated efforts by committee staff to engage with your counsel and accommodate your adjournment requests, you have, to date, failed to comply with the committee\u2019s subpoena or cooperate with the committee\u2019s efforts to secure your compliance,\u201d Schiff wrote in the letter to Flynn, which demands that the retired Army lieutenant general appear for testimony on Sept. 25.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSchiff said Flynn\u2019s new counsel, Sidney Powell, \u201cexhibit[ed] a troubling degree of unprofessionalism\u201d in conversations with committee staffers, outlining a series of interactions between Powell and Schiff\u2019s aides.\n\nAccording to Schiff, Powell \u201crefused to accept service\u201d of the subpoena issued by the panel in June. Schiff indicated that Powell repeatedly sought deadline extensions for Flynn\u2019s cooperation before ultimately ignoring phone calls attempting to arrange Flynn\u2019s testimony for late July, just ahead of Congress\u2019 six-week summer recess.\n\nSchiff also said Powell told the committee that Flynn would invoke his Fifth Amendment rights and would not answer any questions other than confirming his name.\n\n\u201cThe Fifth Amendment privilege must be invoked in response to specific questions or topics that might tend to incriminate you if answered truthfully,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cYour counsel\u2019s blanket invocation of the Fifth Amendment \u2026 is, therefore, inadequate.\u201d\n\nThe Intelligence Committee has been attempting to delve into the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence findings about the Trump campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia in 2016.\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying about his contacts with Russia\u2019s ambassador in the weeks before Trump took office, denying that they had discussed sanctions imposed by the outgoing Obama administration for Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election.\n\nAfter his guilty plea, Flynn cooperated with former special counsel Robert Mueller and his team, providing evidence that helped bolster allegations of obstruction of justice against Trump, as well as filling in details about the campaign\u2019s interactions with Russians. But Flynn\u2019s decision to oust his legal team and hire Powell earlier this year \u2014 just as he was preparing to face sentencing \u2014 signaled a shift in strategy.\n\nPowell has been intensely critical of Schiff and Mueller, and she was a fixture in conservative media and a frequent guest on Fox News.\n\nLast week, Powell filed a brief with the judge in Flynn\u2019s case spelling out a litany of allegations of prosecutorial misconduct \u2014 much of which aligned with Trump\u2019s unsupported allegations against Mueller and his team \u2014 and suggested that the government had withheld evidence from Flynn.\n\nProsecutors intend to sentence Flynn in the fall. Schiff previously suggested that his cooperation with Congress could influence the sentencing judge, Emmet Sullivan, in a way that could ultimately reduce his sentence.\n\n", "description": "The House Intelligence Committee chairman wants Flynn to testify later this month.", "authors": ["Kyle Cheney", "Andrew Desiderio"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/7d/94/4d8105f24a158151d79829d04f8e/190909-adam-schiff-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
