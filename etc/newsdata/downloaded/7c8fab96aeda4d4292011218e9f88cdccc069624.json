Last week, figures from the Office for National Statistics, that uses sold prices \u2013 but lags a month behind \u2013 said that values increased 1.3 per cent annually.\n\nNationwide Building Society recently revealed that prices in September were up just 0.2 per cent annually, while Halifax said they were up 1.1 per cent in the same period.", "description": "The average price of a home coming to market saw its lowest monthly rise at this time of year since October 2008, according to the latest report from property website Rightmove.", "authors": ["Lee Boyce For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
