Some players made a comeback while some new faces will show their strength in tough Australian conditions,\n\n\u201cI was included in the selection process as I have asked the team management to include some of the senior players to help out in crucial stages,\u201d Babar said.\n\nPakistan is to play three matches T20I series against the Aussies at their backyard under a new and young captain.\n\nThe right-handed batsman is confident to lead the team strongly as he often did with the bat by scoring runs. \u201cI believe in myself. I know how potent I can be for my team with the bat. I will try my best to perform in the same way as captain,\u201d he said.\n\nYoung skipper follows India\u2019s Virat Kohli and New Zealand\u2019s Kane Williamson for their captaincy skills and will try to get hold of the things as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cI have started watching successful captains like Kohli and Williamson. They proved themselves as strong captains and led their team to several achievements,\u201d he highlighted.\n\nTalking about former captain Sarfraz Ahmed, Babar wants him to make an early comeback by gaining his form while playing domestic cricket.\n\n\u201cWe will surely miss him in Australia. I am sure that he will try his best to be back in the team earlier,\u201d he said.\n\nTo a query about including his friend and son of former legendary leg-spinner late Abdul Qadir, Usman Qadir, Babar replied that friendship remains outside the field and he was selected following his experience of playing in Australia.\n\n\u201cHe [Usman] is my friend but this is not the reason behind his selection. We considered him due to his knowledge about Australian conditions,\u201d he concluded.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention here that Usman has surprisingly made his place in the national squad. His selection leads to immense criticism as he is the friend of newly appointed captain Babar. The young leggie has followed the footsteps of his father and played a lot of league cricket in Australia.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Pakistan's T20I team captain Babar Azam expressed satisfaction over the team's selection for Australia tour and said that they will try to play with winning approach.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Babar-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
