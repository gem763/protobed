This is for a major record label.\u201d\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nMegan believes this is her \"biggest opportunity\" to break through and she explained: \u201cIn the past I\u2019ve had a very small independent label help me do an album and I\u2019m so grateful for that but as anybody knows in the music industry, that is down there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just the same as everybody else. This is my dream and I\u2019m just hoping that this show can just be the start really as I want to do this full-time.\u201d\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nWhile other celebrities may be doing the show as a bit of fun, for Megan this is a serious attempt to win a record contract and she said the pressure is on her.\n\nShe admitted: \"I feel like I\u2019ve got a lot of pressure because I\u2019ve been really trying to crack the music industry for a long time now and I think coming off of reality shows, people have a perception of me and it\u2019s really difficult to be taken seriously.\n\n\u201cSo I feel like coming on this show, people can see how much this means to me and they will take my music seriously. That\u2019s why I wanted to do it.\u201d\n\nThe X Factor: Celebrity returns to ITV on Saturday at 8.20pm.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
