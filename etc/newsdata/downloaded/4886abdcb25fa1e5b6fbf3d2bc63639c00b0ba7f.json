Take one guess as to why.\n\n\"The significant and large-scale impacts from record-breaking sea surface temperatures have resulted in coral reef habitat transitioning from poor to very poor condition,\" the Australian government reported in their Great Barrier Reef Outlook Report , released every five years.\n\nThe report lists climate change as the most significant threat to the reef long-term, with rising sea temperatures being the most immediate.\n\nThis is only the third comprehensive report by Australia's Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, with the first one issued in 2009.\n\nBut it's possibly the most grim, with the report directly stating that \"the window of opportunity to improve the Reef's long-term future is now.\"\n\n\"In 2009, the Reef was considered to be at a crossroads between a positive, well-managed future and a less certain one,\" the report reads. \"In 2014, it was seen as an icon under pressure, with continued efforts needed to address key threats. Since then, the Region has further deteriorated and, in 2019, Australia is caring for a changed and less resilient Reef.\"\n\nIt doesn't get much more urgent than that.\n\nThe authority is careful to reiterate that it's not too late to save the reef, though it makes note that the challenge is significant. Not every habitat of the reef has been equally affected, as some parts that have escaped bleaching and other threats remain in good condition.\n\nBut, overall, it's not looking too good. At this point, saving the reef would require the mitigation of climate change, the report says.\n\nWhy is the Great Barrier Reef so important?\n\nThe reef is considered to be one of the seven natural wonders in the world -- and one of the largest living structures in the world. It's so big, you can see it from space.\n\nIt's also home to over a thousand species of fish , and hundreds of other types of marine animals.", "description": "The Great Barrier Reef was already in trouble, but now it's been downgraded from 'poor' to 'very poor' in Australia's 2019 Great Barrier Reef Outlook Report.", "authors": ["Leah Asmelash"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180608124127-05-great-barrier-reef-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-30"}
