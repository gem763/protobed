They were found near the White House and across Washington in \u201csensitive locations\u201d, former officials told Politico, adding that the US government determined Israel was \u201cmost likely\u201d behind their placement.\n\nOfficials said the devices were probably planted in order to spy on Mr Trump and his inner circle. But the president declined to take action after his government determined within the last two years that Israel was most likely the foreign entity behind the apparent espionage attempts, three former senior US officials told the news outlet.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Still, the former intelligence officials noted past administrations would have issued a formal diplomatic reprimand \u2013 at the very least \u2013 towards Israel if it were found to have been planting spying devices near the White House.\n\n\u201cThe Israelis are pretty aggressive\u201d when it comes to their intelligence-gathering methods overseas, one former official said, adding: \u201cThey\u2019re all about protecting the security of the Israeli state and they do whatever they feel they have to to achieve that objective.\u201d\n\nThe officials also suggested the US has aggressive intelligence-gathering operations against Israel, with one of those former senior intelligence officials saying: \u201cOn the other hand, guess what we do in Tel Aviv?\u201d\n\nExperts are usually able to ascertain which foreign groups were responsible for attempts of espionage \u201cdepending upon the tradecraft of the people who put them in place\u201d, one official explained.\n\nThey said analysts could then \u201cfigure out who\u2019s been accessing them to pull the data off the devices\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In a statement on Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: \"There is a longstanding commitment, and a directive from the Israeli government not to engage in any intelligence operations in the US. This directive is strictly enforced without exception.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMr Trump has boasted that he has done more than any previous US president for Israel, recognising Jerusalem as its capital and moving the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. The move, in May last year, sparked protests in which more than 50 Palestinians were killed.\n\nThis year he recognised Israeli sovereignty over the disputed Golan Heights, saying the area was a \u201cgift\u201d to prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who reacted by comparing the US president to Cyrus the Great, an ancient Persian king.\n\nLast month he tweeted a quote from a right-wing conspiracy theorist describing him as the \u201cking of Israel\u201d and saying that American Jews loved him like he was \u201cthe second coming of God\u201d.\n\nThe president followed that up by declaring that Jewish Americans who vote for Democratic candidates show \u201ca total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty\u201d to Israel, a controversial statement which quickly sparked outcry. He also involved Mr Netanyahu in his battle with two Muslim Democratic politicians, asking him to block Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib from entering Israel over what he described as antisemitic remarks.\n\nMr Trump was the first sitting US president to visit the Western Wall in Jerusalem. The trip generated controversy when his White House declined to say whether it believed the Western Wall belonged to Israel.\n\nIn the Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, Jewish settlement construction has also rapidly increased ever since Mr Trump took office, according to reports.", "description": "Donald Trump did not take action against Israel after it was accused of planting spying devices found near the White House in a move that has shocked former intelligence officials, according to a new report.", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/13/trumpbolton.jpg"}
