At least 85% of villages in the Amazon, a vast region that spans eight countries and the French territory of Guiana - cannot celebrate Mass every week. Some see a priest only once a year.\n\nConservative opponents fear it would be a doctrinal Trojan horse that would then spread to the entire Church in the West.\n\n\n\n\n\nHERESY AND ERROR\n\nThey have attacked the synod's working document as heretical, including what they say is an implicit recognition of forms of paganism and pantheism practised by indigenous people, such as nature worship.\n\nThe three-week synod will discuss spreading the faith in the vast region, a greater role for women, environmental protection, climate change, deforestation, indigenous people and their right to keep their land and traditions.\n\nBill Donohue, president of the U.S.-based Catholic League, a conservative group, drew criticism for what was perceived as a condescending attitude toward native cultures when he said this week that a dilemma in the Amazon was \"how to respect the culture of indigenous peoples while at the same time acknowledging inherent deficiencies in it.\"\n\nA number of conservatives have tweeted their disapproval of a three-planting ceremony in the Vatican on Thursday in which people from the Amazon used native symbols and gestures, such as blessing the earth.\n\nIn his sermon, Francis said indigenous cultures had to be respected.\n\n\"When peoples and cultures are devoured without love and without respect, it is not God\u2019s fire but that of the world. Yet how many times has God\u2019s gift been imposed, not offered; how many times has there been colonization rather than evangelization!\" he said.\n\nThe synod is taking place at a time when the Amazon is in the world spotlight because of the devastating fires in Brazil. Francis implied that he believed at least some of the fires were intentionally set.\n\n\"The fire set by interests that destroy, like the fire that recently devastated Amazonia, is not the fire of the Gospel (which is) fed by sharing, not by profits,\" he said.\n\nThe synod does not make decisions. Participants vote on a final document and the pope will decide which recommendations to integrate into his future rulings.\n\n(Reporting By Philip Pullella Editing by Frances Kerrry)", "description": "Pope Francis appealed to conservatives on Sunday not to be bound by the status quo as he opened an assembly of bishops to discuss the future of the Roman Catholic Church in the Amazon, including the possibility of introducing married priests.
