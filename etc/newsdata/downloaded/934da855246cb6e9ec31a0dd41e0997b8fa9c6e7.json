Some streets were littered with broken glass and twisted metal debris from the protests.\n\nThe protests started four months ago in opposition to a now withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be sent to China, but have broadened into a pro-democracy movement amid fear that Beijing is undermining Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula, which gives residents greater freedom than mainland Chinese.\n\nThe unrest is the worst political crisis since Britain handed the city back to China in 1997 and the biggest challenge to President Xi Jinping since he came into power in 2012.\n\nEdward Leung, 27, one of the leaders of a movement advocating independence from China, and two other activists, in 2016 received the harshest sentences handed down to pro-democracy leaders since the city returned to Chinese rule.\n\nIn his appeal, Leung\u2019s lawyer argued his sentence was disproportionate to his offence, citing other more violent protesters receiving lighter sentences.
