According to the job description, the person in this role will be tasked with \u2018identify new business opportunities to drive revenue\u2019 and \u2018will be instrumental in helping to deliver a new online platform with the aim of acquiring new customers and driving online sales\u2019\u2026 despite the fact Lidl currently don\u2019t sell anything online.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey\u2019ll also have to \u2018contribute not only to individual projects but also to the ongoing formation and success of other functional areas\u2019, suggesting plenty of options for growth.\n\nMiddle of Lidl straight to the door? Sign us up (Picture: Canopy)\n\nThe successful candidate will be based out of Lidl\u2019s head office in Wimbledon, so get applying if it suits your experience.\n\nOn top of that, bosses at the store told The Grocer that they were planning a brand new \u2018platform\u2019 that customers could use to purchase products. Do we smell an app?\n\nThey claimed they were \u2018actively exploring\u2019 the possibility of moving into this sphere.\n\nIt\u2019ll be welcome for all of us who love their produce, but perhaps not so much for Aldi, who currently offer online purchasing (but only on certain special buy products).\n\nWith their competition in the digital game, they\u2019ll have to compete. Hopefully this means more releases of fancy candles and cleansers, or just a full-service grocery delivery option!\n\nOther supermarkets who\u2019ve been offering home delivery and online shopping for years include Asda, Tesco, and Sainsbury\u2019s, who let you order everything from pints of milk to homeware online.\n\nSo if Lidl are planning to go big (and beat Aldi) they may emulate this. We can but dream.\n\nMetro.co.uk have contacted Lidl for comment, and will update this article when they provide it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Only the privileged can afford not to eat on public transport\n\nAD FEATURE: How to create a harmonious haven (without any stress!)\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Stock up on all your favourites with the new home delivery option from Lidl.
