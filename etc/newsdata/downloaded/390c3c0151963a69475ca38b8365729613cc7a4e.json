Sources told the L.A. Times that he is not suspected of opioid use himself\n\nKay is currently on paid leave as he deals with his own opioid addiction, but he did release a statement to ESPN through his attorneys.\n\n'I felt and continue to feel that it is time for everyone to stand up and take responsibility for their respective roles in this,' the statement read. 'Nothing anyone does will ever provide closure for the Skaggs family. I can't, the Angels can't, and the courts can't, regardless of what happens there. But at least I can help them 'know' instead of \"wonder.\" My hope is that there is some peace in that for them.'\n\nESPN's 'Outside the Lines' reported Saturday that Kay also interviewed with DEA agents in both Dallas and Los Angeles field offices in September.

'That is all I can do from this point on, if it comes with public shame and derision, I accept that.'\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, the Angels released a statement in response to ESPN's initial report.\n\n'We have never heard that any employee was providing illegal narcotics to any player, or that any player was seeking illegal narcotics,' Angels president John Carpino said. 'The Angels maintain a strict, zero tolerance policy regarding the illicit use of drugs for both players and staff. Every one of our players must also abide by the MLB Joint Drug Agreement. We continue to mourn the loss of Tyler and fully cooperate with the authorities as they continue their investigation.'", "description": "Federal agents have questioned at least six current and former Los Angeles Angels players as part of an ongoing investigation into the opioid death of pitcher Tyler Skaggs.", "authors": ["Alex Raskin Sports News Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/14/19788334-0-image-a-2_1571231398400.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
