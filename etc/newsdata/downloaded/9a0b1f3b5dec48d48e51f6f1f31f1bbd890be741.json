(Reuters)\n\nKobe Bryant may be retired, but \u201cMamba Mentality\u201d isn\u2019t.\n\nThe former Los Angeles Lakers great known for his ruthless competitiveness that showed up in forms like belittling teammate Smush Parker and taunting opponents is now coaching his daughter\u2019s youth basketball team.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThat team comprised of girls around 13 years old recently posted a fourth-place finish that Bryant noted on his Instagram page.\n\nFourth place \u2018winners\u2019\n\nTo the surprise of nobody, there appears to have been no joy in the occasion.\n\nAside from the look of absolute melancholy on each of the young girls\u2019 faces, the post features Bryant mocking the team\u2019s finish as \u201cfourth place \u2018winners\u2019\u201d and goes the extra mile to shame a player for daring to prioritize something ahead of playing basketball for Kobe Bryant.\n\nInstagram/kobebryant\n\n\u2018That should tell you where her focus was\u2019\n\n\u201cThe 7th player [not in the pic] missed this game for a dance recital so that should tell you where her focus was at the time,\u201d Bryant wrote.\n\nOuch. There will be no exploring passions as a young adult on Kobe\u2019s watch. Unless, of course, that passion happens to be basketball.\n\nApparently even Kobe thought his original assessment of said dancer was a little harsh. The above image is a screenshot of the original post.\n\nHe has since published a version that\u2019s been slightly amended.\n\nThe reworked section of the post reads as follows:\n\n\u201cThe 7th player (not in pic) missed this game for a dance recital so that should tell you where her focus was at the time, meaning she enjoyed dance more than ball which is fine.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s all love\u2019\n\nHe also attempted to explain the messaging in a Twitter post.\n\nStory continues\n\nNah fam I was just explaining why she wasn\u2019t in the pic. Most of my kids on the team played and still play other sports including my daughter so it\u2019s all love. Don\u2019t misunderstand the message. \u2014 Kobe Bryant (@kobebryant) September 11, 2019\n\nAnd posted a happier photo of his team.\n\nFor the record, even thou they HATED fourth place. I did ask them to at least smile for one pic \ud83d\ude03 pic.twitter.com/QgNdaE1P93 \u2014 Kobe Bryant (@kobebryant) September 11, 2019\n\nCelebrate the positive\n\nLest Bryant be portrayed as a taskmaster focused only on negative reinforcement, a post from earlier in the week demonstrates otherwise.\n\nHis girls posted a 115-27 victory in another game.\n\nBryant was all about that.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nJason Owens is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
