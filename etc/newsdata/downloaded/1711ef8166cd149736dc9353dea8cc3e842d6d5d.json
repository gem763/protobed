While the other pair (Rosie and David) were so hapless, neither particularly deserved to go through to this year\u2019s grand finale.\n\nTo be honest, Rosie\u2019s revelations about her job were more riveting, albeit possibly too informative for some viewers.\n\n\u2018What\u2019s the smelliest thing you\u2019ve come across?!\u2019 Noel wondered, as Rosie prepared her Showstopper.\n\n\u2018Nasty abscesses can be bad,\u2019 she said, all too convincingly.\n\nUnappetising: Rosie the vet\u2019s chat with Noel about castrating pigs proved unappetising for the judges and she failed to make the finals of the competition\n\nEarlier he\u2019d become intrigued by the less romantic aspects of life as a vet after she informed him matter-of-factly: \u2018I\u2019ve castrated many pigs.\u2019\n\n\u2018What\u2019s the biggest animal you\u2019ve castrated?\u2019 he, um, probed.\n\n\u2018A giant bull,\u2019 she said casually.\n\nAren\u2019t they all, you thought? Or was it a massive, freakish, specimen?\n\nMade it: Two of the contestants - Alice and Steph (pictured) - qualified quite comfortably \u2013 by being consistent rather than brilliant. While the other pair - Rosie and David - were so hapless\n\nWe\u2019ll never know. Rosie had cakes to make so their crash-course ended there and eventually the Baker the judges decided would miss out on the final.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t help thinking Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith had overheard Rosie\u2019s conversations with Noel and made her cr\u00e8me pat slightly less appetising.\n\nAnd how many pigs was the \u2018many pigs\u2019 she\u2019d castrated with those same fingers?\n\nAnyway I digress \u2013 as Noel Fielding did, unsurprisingly.\n\nOops: You couldn\u2019t help thinking Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith had overheard Rosie\u2019s conversations with Noel and made her cr\u00e8me pat slightly less appetising\n\nThe presenters had 75 minutes to fill and only four (dull) Bakers to work with.\n\nSandi Toksvig overdid her obsession with domed tartlets during the Signature Challenge. Noel meanwhile spent the show teasing Rosie, Alice, Steph, and David then hastily assuring them: \u2018I\u2019m joking!\u2019 (Never a good sign.)\n\nBy the end they\u2019d resorted to silly tricks, as if they were hosting a children\u2019s birthday party.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t really blame them though.\n\nWorking hard: The presenters had 75 minutes to fill and only four (dull) Bakers to work with. Sandi Toksvig overdid her obsession with domed tartlets during the Signature Challenge\n\nThe four contestants arrived wearing ties, in honour of Henry. Which was a touching gesture but only made you wish he were still in it. And reminded you he should have been.\n\nWithout the series\u2019 most charming, challenging, Baker, it wasn\u2019t much of a show or a contest.\n\nAlice was, deservedly, Star Baker but even she struggled with two of the three Challenges in Patisserie Week.\n\nMissing out: The four contestants arrived wearing ties, in honour of Henry. Which was a touching gesture but only made you wish he were still in it\n\nFor the domed tartlets in the Signature, Hollywood scornfully scoffed that her pipework was \u2018not particularly good.\u2019\n\nThen she came last in the Technical with her attempt at a gateau St. Honore, admitting/quipping: \u2018Je ne sais pas puff.\u2019\n\nShe soared through to the final though with her Showstopper \u2013 \u2018a representation of a coral reef\u2019 in a (sugar) glass case.\n\nStandards are slipping: Steph had been awarded Star Baker in four of the eight episodes but equally mostly unimpressive in Patisserie Week\n\nSteph had been awarded Star Baker in four of the eight episodes but equally mostly unimpressive in Patisserie Week.\n\nHollywood thought her domed tartlets \u2018not very neat on the bottom\u2019 and \u2018akin to a lemon meringue pie\u2019 (a heinous crime apparently).\n\nSteph only came third in the Technical. Her gateau St Honore had \u2018big holes\u2019 he said (ditto) and her Chiboust \u2018like scrambled egg.\u2019\n\nEven though you had no idea what this was (Chiboust that is), you still knew that was a disaster.\n\nNo competition: With no Henry in the final, they might as well give the title to Steph now. It would be slightly ridiculous if she loses out to David\n\nShe also redeemed herself with the Showstopper.\n\n\u2018Everything you\u2019ve done is very neat, very tidy, very Steph!\u2019 swooned Paul, while Prue Leith went even further.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re a very good baker Stephanie. You really are.\u2019\n\nWith no Henry in the final, they might as well give the title to Steph now.\n\nIt would be slightly ridiculous if she loses out to David - given the gulf between them during the series. It\u2019s hard to see it happening in any case.\n\nHe could easily have been eliminated having made some strange choices here.\n\n\u2018This is Patisserie Week and I didn\u2019t really do a patisserie,\u2019 he reflected before the judges\u2019 verdict, without saying why (or, more accurately, why not). \u2018It was more a cake.\u2019\n\nUnimpressed: Paul Hollywood was certainly unimpressed, complaining: \u2018Patisserie Week is all about delicacy, finesse, and intricate detail\n\nPaul Hollywood was certainly unimpressed, complaining: \u2018Patisserie Week is all about delicacy, finesse, and intricate detail. Putting sponge on sponge on sponge on sponge on sponge is slightly wayward.\u2019\n\nEven presenter Sandi Toksvig had a pop at David\u2019s Showstopper (as it were), tutting: \u2018it looked like a sandwich!\u2019\n\nRosie somehow managed to be even more \u2018wayward\u2019 (worse) though.\n\nFor the Signature Challenge, the cr\u00e8me pat in her domed tartlets didn\u2019t set properly \u2013 a fairly significant minor detail in Patisserie Week.\n\nThen in the Technical, she fell apart even more than her gateau, weeping to Sandi Toksvig: \u2018everything\u2019s gone wrong! My choux pastry is liquid but I don\u2019t understand why! My pastry\u2019s failed as well. I might just go home now!\u2019\n\n\u2018Slow down! Deep breath!\u2019 Sandi said patiently, as if calming a child. \u2018You\u2019ve got this.\u2019\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think I do have this,\u2019 wailed Rosie, regardless.\n\nHorrifying: Last week viewers had been amazed/horrified when the judges\u2019 favourable placement meant Rosie survived at Henry\u2019s expense\n\nLast week viewers had been amazed/horrified when the judges\u2019 favourable placement meant Rosie survived at Henry\u2019s expense.\n\nTo be fair to her, Rosie was speechless when she heard Paul Hollywood announced St Honore had won tonight\u2019s Technical \u2013 \u2018even though your choux buns were upside down.\u2019\n\nAs it so often does, this meant Patisserie Week all came down to the Showstopper.\n\nGlam: As it so often does, this meant Patisserie Week all came down to the Showstopper. Even though David neglected to make anything very patisserie\n\nEven though David neglected to make anything very patisserie, Rosie\u2019s sugar glass case was virtually empty.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a bit simplistic considering it\u2019s a centerpiece, a Showstopper,\u2019 Paul mentioned with some understatement, pointing out that even the small piles of choux pastries she had made were \u2018a bit boring, a bit dry, floury. And there\u2019s no flavor to it.\u2019\n\nApart from that though, he loved them.\n\nBut not enough for her to make it to the final\u2026\n\nSo if Rosie wants to find fame and fortune, her best option is probably pursuing Noel Fielding\u2019s idea earlier \u2013 when he said their conversations about animals/vetinary practices were \u2018more interesting\u2019 than this semi-final.\n\n\u2018We should have our own spin-off series!\u2019", "description": "It was the semi-final of The Great British Bake and Patisserie Week - a mouth-watering prospect, particularly when Paul Hollywood smiled that combining them was 'pretty cruel.'", "authors": ["Jim Shelley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/21/20053328-0-image-a-22_1571775139642.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
