Or, for that matter, because a seven-hour series of lectures on *any* policy topic, particularly by self-serving candidates for high office, is destined to be insufferable.\n\nI say \u201cof course\u201d because CNN is almost always last in the evening ratings. Of course their climate-change series finished last. It was a day ending in \u201cy.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the funny part: This endless grueling slog through familiar Democratic talking points about sustainability actually rated higher than CNN\u2019s regular primetime programming. Something as didactic as Elizabeth Warren riffing about windmills drew more viewers than Anderson Cooper, Don Lemon, and Chris Cuomo exploring the hottest news of the day. Maybe CNN should start airing insurance seminars at night. Ratings might improve.\n\nCNN averaged 1.1 million viewers from 5 p.m. to midnight, the hours devoted to back-to-back town halls by 10 Democratic contenders. MSNBC finished second with 1.7 million total viewers during the time period, with Fox News winning the time period with an average of 2.5 million. Both channels provided regular programming on Wednesday night\u2026 During the 8 p.m.-11 p.m. hours of prime time, Fox News averaged 3.2 million total viewers, placing first. MSNBC was second with a 2.2 million average and CNN third with 1.4 million. However the average 1.4 million tuning in to CNN for the event was well above its average in primetime in 2019.\n\n\u201cIn fairness to Biden, everyone who is watching this has blood coming out of their eyes,\u201d said Stephen \u201credsteeze\u201d Miller while it was airing.\n\nNo way to know which way the viewing audience leaned but this point made me laugh too because it jibes with my own experience on social media today:\n\nSo far I've only seen conservatives tweet clips from the CNN climate thing \u2014 Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) September 5, 2019\n\nDid righties hate-watch it, for outrage fuel in the \u201cI can\u2019t believe how crazy these people are!\u201d vein? Democratic voters have heard this shtick from their candidates ad nauseam for months. Why would they watch? Unless it was for the same reason that CNN aired the event \u2014 not because they wanted to, exactly, but because they concluded that being a responsible public citizen requires at least formally registering concern about this issue.\n\nThe problem with climate-change chitchat from lefties is that it turns the appeal of their basic ideological pitch on its head. Democrats spend most of their time telling voters what they\u2019re going to give them \u2014 free health care and forgiveness of student loan debt for starters, along with 50 other forms of redistribution. Right, those things aren\u2019t technically free since they require new taxes to fund them, but don\u2019t you worry. Rich people have a limitless supply of wealth that can be expropriated, or so we\u2019re told. On climate change the Democratic pitch is the opposite: You\u2019re going to have to make sacrifices, some big and some very small, for the common good. And in many ways that common good won\u2019t be visible to you in terms of concrete improvements. Change your diet, change your transportation, socialize the economy, and maybe we can preserve America\u2019s coastlines roughly in their current shape for awhile. Provided Europe, China, and India agree to tighten their own belts too.\n\nIf modern Americans were willing to radically change their lifestyle expectations in return for long-term sustainability, we would have had a serious national conversation long ago about America\u2019s ability to fund its most popular government programs. It\u2019s precisely because politicians risk ruin by tinkering with those expectations, in fact, that even minor climate-change proposals like banning straws get such attention on the right. A proposal like that drives home in a trivial but real way that sacrifices will have to be made down to the micro level to implement the Democratic agenda. You, personally, are going to feel it. Andrew Yang, easily the most likable Democrat left in the race, told a national audience last night that not only would cars powered by fossil fuels need to be phased out, the feds might have to institute a buyback program to get current models off the road. Who\u2019s paying for that? How\u2019s that idea going to play in the midwest? Good luck, progressives.\n\nThe buzziest clip from the event that\u2019s online today didn\u2019t come from the townhall itself but from Pete Buttigieg\u2019s follow-up appearance on CNN this morning, in which he reminded burger-lovers that they\u2019re part of the problem. He didn\u2019t dwell on it, and if you\u2019re familiar with Democratic climate-change arguments there\u2019s nothing surprising about what he said. Shrinking the country\u2019s carbon footprint means shrinking the meat industry\u2019s considerable carbon footprint. The clip is circulating, though, because it\u2019s efficient shorthand for how the progressive agenda would deprive average people of even simple pleasures to achieve its ideological goals. Would these green clerics who zip around the country on private jets really snatch the Whopper out of your hands in the name of saving the polar bears?
