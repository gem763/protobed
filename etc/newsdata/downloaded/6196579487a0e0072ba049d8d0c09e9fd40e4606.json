He is 40, and she is 36.\n\nI have been asked frequently if they plan to have children. I was actually asked at the reception by friends and relatives! AT THE RECEPTION. Even the manager asked if we would use their venue for a baby shower or christening.\n\nCarolyn, this is no one's business, certainly not mine, and definitely not the business of extended family nor friends. I have just been answering, \"I don't know.\" Is there a better answer that would communicate how intrusive this question is? Stating that it's no one's business but theirs seems rude to this old gal, but I may need to head in that direction, since the questions keep coming four months after the wedding. HELP!\n\n\u2014 Questioned\n\nQuestioned: \u201cI don\u2019t ask. Couples get enough of this pressure, no? They don\u2019t need it from me.\u201d The next couple in their sights will be solidly, if unwittingly, in your debt.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d is a fine answer, too, though; the simple truth can be an underrated weapon.\n\nI know people are just trying to make conversation, but, seriously?\n\nDear Carolyn: I love my partner, and we have a happy relationship of many years. The downside is that many people see us as a unit. I know I shouldn't complain about having many friends who love and enjoy us together, but we are always invited as a couple, and my partner is not a people person and doesn't want to go when I would willingly go.\n\nMy partner has no objection whatsoever to my attending without her, but other people don't understand, and I'm often put in the position of trying to make excuses for my partner or coming up with reasons she's not coming.\n\nShort of saying, \"She doesn't like to socialize,\" any suggestions for getting people to understand we are two different people, one of whom prefers not to hang out with you? I know specific people would feel hurt and rejected if I'm clumsy in what I say, and I have to be careful as well not to put my partner in a bad light.\n\n\u2014 Just Take Me\n\nJust Take Me: No one puts you in a position to make excuses or come up with reasons. Except you.\n\nThat\u2019s because the need to explain your and your partner\u2019s business (or have it understood) is not real, it\u2019s only perceived; it\u2019s your read on these situations.\n\nClearly it reflects your own discomfort more than anything else \u2014 your partner seems fine with it all \u2014 and it\u2019s this discomfort whispering in your ear that the truth is too bad to be told.\n\nIn fact, what keeps your partner home is really neither good nor bad. Her reluctance to socialize is just like your eagerness to, a normal variation in a normal personality.\n\nSo keep RSVP\u2019ing for one as needed, and share the reason freely when asked: \u201cShe\u2019s a homebody,\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s tucked in, and sends her love,\u201d etc. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s about her, not the hosts or other guests or whoever else might be poised to take offense. (Which they might, but you told a kind truth, so that\u2019s on them.)\n\nShe stays in. You go out. Don\u2019t explain more when there\u2019s nothing more to explain.", "description": "Parent of a newlywed grows weary of questions about grandchildren.", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist", "September At Pm", "Carolyn Hax Started Her Advice Column In", "After Five Years As A Copy Editor", "News Editor In Style", "None As A Therapist.
