Mr. Forster\u2019s death coincided with the release of his latest film, \u201cEl Camino,\u201d a spinoff of the AMC series \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d in which he played a fixer who fashions a new identity for Bryan Cranston\u2019s meth kingpin.\n\nMr. Forster began his film career as an Army private who, in \u201cReflections in a Golden Eye\u201d (1967), gallops naked through the woods atop a black stallion, catching the eye of Brando and Elizabeth Taylor. More than four decades later, he found himself promoted to general, playing a military leader in \u201cOlympus Has Fallen\u201d (2013), an action thriller about a terrorist attack on the White House.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn between came dozens of roles as cops, detectives and straight-talking heavies, in grindhouse pictures with names like \u201cScanner Cop II: Volkin\u2019s Revenge\u201d and \u201cPoint of Seduction: Body Chemistry III.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy career went upwards for about five years and then downwards for about 27 years,\u201d Mr. Forster told New York magazine in 2018, recalling his working life before \u201cJackie Brown\u201d (1997), in which he played a melancholy bail bondsman named Max Cherry. The part was written for him by Tarantino, a former video-rental clerk who had admired Mr. Forster in movies such as \u201cMedium Cool\u201d (1969), a countercultural touchstone by filmmaker Haskell Wexler, and \u201cThe Delta Force\u201d (1986), in which he played a Lebanese terrorist pursued by Chuck Norris and Lee Marvin.\n\nMr. Forster, who traced his ancestry to Italy, England and Ireland, was often cast against ethnic type, enlisted to play Native American figures or foreign despots such as Manuel Antonio Noriega of Panama and Moammar Gaddafi of Libya. Reviewing \u201cDelta Force,\u201d Roger Ebert wrote that he \u201cgives a frighteningly good performance, intense and uncompromising,\u201d and kept the film \u201cfrom becoming just an action comic book.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn recent years he worked with directors including Alexander Payne, as George Clooney\u2019s father-in-law in \u201cThe Descendants\u201d (2011), and David Lynch, as a detective in \u201cMulholland Drive\u201d (2001) and as Sherrif Frank Truman in the 2017 Showtime revival of \u201cTwin Peaks.\u201d (Mr. Forster had previously been offered the part of Truman\u2019s lawman brother, Harry, for the series\u2019 original run in the early 1990s; he turned it down because he was working on another show, and the role went to Michael Ontkean.)\n\nNotable deaths in 2019: Ric Ocasek, Valerie Harper, Ross Perot, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image Ginger Baker, the prodigiously talented and volcanically temperamental rock drummer who helped form Cream, rock-and-roll\u2019s first supergroup, and inspired awe and imitation in a generation of drummers, died Oct. 6 at 80. Read the obituary (Mj Kim/AP)\n\nMr. Forster\u2019s late-career renaissance marked a return to the more artistically ambitious fare of his 1960s heyday, which began with \u201cGolden Eye\u201d (1995), directed by John Huston and adapted from a novel by Carson McCullers. Mr. Forster had never made a movie \u2014 or ridden a horse \u2014 before the film, and told the pop culture website the A.V. Club that he was handed the equivalent of a tan jockstrap for his infamous equestrian nude scene.\n\nHe ultimately tossed the cloth covering into the bushes, and recalled thinking: \u201c \u2018Bob, if you are afraid to be naked on this horse, you\u2019d better quit, because if you don\u2019t do it with full abandon, with absolute abandon, then you have no right to be an actor. You\u2019d better quit now.\u2019 And that was the moment I said to myself, \u2018All right, just go with it, Bob.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Forster appeared alongside Peck in a Western, \u201cThe Stalking Moon\u201d (1968), and beginning in 1971 played the hard-boiled lead of \u201cBanyon,\u201d an NBC detective series set in 1930s Los Angeles. The show was canceled after about a dozen episodes, kicking off Mr. Forster\u2019s self-described \u201c27-year slump\u201d \u2014 during which he starred in the short-lived police series \u201cNakia\u201d and appeared in movies such as \u201cThe Black Hole\u201d (1979), \u201cAlligator\u201d (1980) and \u201cVigilante\u201d (1982).\n\nAs acting jobs dried up, he also found work as a drama teacher and motivational speaker, urging companies, organizations and (on at least one occasion) a group of imprisoned white-collar criminals to \u201cdeliver excellence right now\u201d and \u201cnever quit.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter how bad things get,\u201d he insisted, \u201cyou can still win it in the late innings.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat philosophy paid off for Mr. Forster when he was cast in \u201cJackie Brown,\u201d based on Elmore Leonard\u2019s novel \u201cRum Punch.\u201d Tarantino had revived the career of John Travolta with his smash hit \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and, with \u201cJackie,\u201d did the same for Mr. Forster and 1970s blaxploitation star Pam Greer, who played the title character, a money-smuggling flight attendant.\n\nMr. Forster received an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor but lost to Robin Williams, for \u201cGood Will Hunting.\u201d Nonetheless, he said, \u201cthe nomination has given me my career back. And it\u2019s created a tremendous amount of good will. . . . For a guy who could not get a job just a few years ago to now have people come up to me on the street and say nice things \u2014 it\u2019s just astounding.\u201d\n\nRobert Wallace Foster Jr. was born in Rochester, N.Y., on July 13, 1941. (He later added an \u201cr\u201d to Foster after learning another actor shared his name.) His father was a Ringling Bros. elephant trainer who became an executive at a baking supply company; his mother was a homemaker.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey divorced when Mr. Forster was 8, and his mother later killed herself after Mr. Forster received his draft notice in 1966. In part, he told the New York Times, \u201cshe was hysterical about the thought of my going to Vietnam.\u201d Mr. Forster received a deferment, partly through medical statements describing the \u201cdevastating psychological effects\u201d of his mother\u2019s death.\n\nMr. Forster studied history and psychology at the University of Rochester, where he was mulling a career as a lawyer, when he spotted a young woman in a black leather raincoat. \u201cAs I was trying to think of what to say, I followed her into an auditorium,\u201d he recalled in a Rochester alumni magazine interview.\n\nStudents were auditioning for a production of \u201cBye Bye Birdie;\u201d the woman, June Provenzano, was a crew member. Mr. Forster landed a role in the chorus and fell in love with both acting and Provenzano, whom he married in 1966. They later divorced.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1964, Mr. Forster moved to New York, starring opposite Arlene Francis in a Broadway production of \u201cMrs. Dally Has a Lover,\u201d which galvanized his acting career.\n\nHe later appeared in movies including \u201cAmerican Perfekt\u201d (1997), a thriller by director Paul Chart, and \u201cWhat They Had\u201d (2018), in what Los Angeles Times critic Gary Goldstein described as \u201ca stunning, Oscar-worthy turn as a man struggling to hold onto a blissful past to ward off a frightening future.\u201d\n\nHis second marriage, to Zivia Forster, also ended in divorce. Survivors include his partner of 16 years, Denise Grayson; a son from a relationship, Bobby Forster; three daughters from his first marriage, Elizabeth Foster Howell, Maeghen Perry Dimperio and Kate Forster Simmons; and four grandchildren.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn interviews, Mr. Forster rarely shied away from discussing the fallow period in the middle of his career, and the toll it took on him and his family. \u201cEvery time it reached a lower level I thought I could tolerate, it dropped some more, and then some more,\u201d he told the Chicago Tribune last year. \u201cNear the end I had no agent, no manager, no lawyer, no nothing. I was taking whatever fell through the cracks.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cyou know what,\u201d he added, \u201ceverything teaches you something. The job of real life is the job of caring for others. Everything you do in life is superfluous compared to that.\u201d\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nAD", "description": "He was also featured in the 2017 revival of \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d and the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d film \u201cEl Camino.\u201d", "authors": ["Harrison Smith", "Obituary Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Q60-0-FFkfvvDp5XVW-yX8HTVp4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/N3W3Y5XOAAI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
