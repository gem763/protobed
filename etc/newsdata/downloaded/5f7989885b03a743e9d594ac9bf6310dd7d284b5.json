(AP) - West Virginia\u2019s defense has turned to a group of freshmen to shore up a depleted unit during the most difficult part of the schedule.\n\nWest Virginia used safety Tykee Smith and cornerbacks Nicktroy Fortune and Tae Mayo in a 38-14 loss to Iowa State on Saturday. The youngsters will be counted on again when the Mountaineers (3-3, 1-2 Big 12) try to break a two-game losing streak Saturday at No. 5 Oklahoma (6-0, 3-0).\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t going to get any easier, so we\u2019ve just got to keep trying to find guys that will do what we ask them to do,\u201d defensive coordinator Vic Koenning said.\n\nSmith will get his third straight start against the Sooners. He grabbed a wild deflection and returned the first-quarter interception 19 yards for a touchdown against the Cyclones.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the best plays I\u2019ve ever seen, to be able to find the ball like that,\u201d linebacker Josh Chandler said.\n\nSmith is tied for fifth in team tackles and entered the starting lineup after JoVanni Stewart decided not to play again this season for personal reasons.\n\nFortune made his first start in place of team interception leader Keith Washington, who had sustained a leg injury the week before against Texas. Mayo played the second half against Iowa State after Hakeem Bailey was ejected for targeting. Mayo will be called upon again Saturday because Bailey will have to sit out the first half against Oklahoma, while Washington\u2019s status is questionable.\n\nAdding to the mix are freshman Kerry Martin, a converted quarterback, and redshirt freshman Kwantel Raines. Both have seen significant playing time at safety in recent weeks, and freshman backup nose guard Jordan Jefferson has added stability along the line.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely proud of them,\u201d Chandler said. \u201cEvery day since the day they stepped on campus, they\u2019ve been balling. They\u2019ve been doing what they\u2019ve had to do.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a trying season for Brown, who\u2019s also has had to dip into what little experience and depth he has on offense.\n\nBackup quarterback Jack Allison could get his first start of the season in place of Oklahoma graduate transfer Austin Kendall, who is questionable after leaving Saturday\u2019s game with a chest injury. Allison, a junior, went 18 of 24 for 140 yards with one touchdown pass and an interception against Iowa State.\n\nWith sophomore wide receiver Sean Ryan out several games with a chest injury, freshman Sam James, the team\u2019s leading receiver, had five catches Saturday despite being banged up. Freshmen Winston Wright and Ali Jennings also have been leaned on to help generate some offense. Brown revealed Tuesday that slot receiver Tevin Bush, a junior, will enter the transfer portal.\n\nWest Virginia set seasons lows of 53 offensive plays and 190 total yards against Iowa State and were outscored 24-0 in the second half. The Mountaineers\u2019 running game has been held under 100 yards in four of six games this season.\n\nTrying to accomplish anything against Oklahoma could be impossible. The Sooners average 50 points and 622 yards per game and have improved greatly on defense. West Virginia is a four-touchdown underdog.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re experiencing some growing pains. I think that\u2019s obvious,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI think our kids are playing with great effort. Our execution and our playmaking is not what it needs to be.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "West Virginia's defense has turned to a group of freshmen to shore up a depleted unit during the most difficult part of the schedule.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Raby", "John Ra"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/iowa_st_west_virginia_football_70889_c0-157-3776-2359_s1200x700.jpg?4279df24505eab64be556caf4e9cd73a78b4825f", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
