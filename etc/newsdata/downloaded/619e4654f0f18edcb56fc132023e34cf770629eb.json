One MP cited Crawford Falconer, the U.K.\u2019s chief trade negotiation adviser in the Department for International Trade, as a potential candidate.\n\nFrost declined an interview request.\n\nVote Leave gang\n\nFrost worked as a special adviser for foreign affairs when Johnson was foreign secretary but lost his job when the latter resigned from the Cabinet in protest at Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan.\n\nFrost then became the chief executive at the London Chamber of Commerce, but continued to work closely with the future prime minister and his small team as they plotted his path to power from the backbenches.\n\nOne of those involved said Frost attended meetings with this team roughly every two weeks, but it had been clear from the way he spoke he was in constant touch with the future prime minister.\n\n\u201cBoris has the ideas, Frosty puts them into practice,\u201d the figure said.\n\nWell before Johnson took office as prime minister, it was clear he was planning to replace Olly Robbins, Theresa May\u2019s chief adviser on Brexit, who became somewhat of a bogeyman for Brexiteer MPs.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t Frost\u2019s glittering civil service career, which includes running Europe units in government departments and serving as ambassador to Denmark, that won the trust of the prime minister and subsequently his former Vote Leave colleagues. It was his commitment to Brexit.\n\n\u201cThe thing about Frosty is he has got the air of the establishment about him,\u201d a former Vote Leave campaigner who is now in government said. \u201cHe had done all these big roles and so on, and Boris trusts him 100 percent. But equally we feel like he is one of us.\u201d\n\nHe said Frost had compromised \u201ca bit more than the rest of us,\u201d but Johnson\u2019s team trusts him to \u201cend up with the thing that we want.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of us trust him,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cIt is quite a difficult thing to get into the Vote Leave gang. There are not many people who have done it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLee [Cain, Johnson\u2019s director of communications] trusts him, Dom [Cummings, Johnson\u2019s senior adviser] trusts him, Oliver Lewis [Johnson\u2019s no-deal adviser] trusts him,\u201d the adviser added. \u201cThere are not many people you can say that about.\u201d\n\nOne Cabinet minister said Frost had been a \u201cgood appointment\u201d who had been key in giving confidence to the European Research Group of Brexit-supporting MPs, without alienating other wings of the Conservative Party. \u201cHe was open to discussion, and he met lots of people,\u201d the minister said.\n\nDeputy Chairman of the European Research Group Mark Francois told POLITICO before the deal had been done that the ERG had held a private meeting with Frost \u201ca little while ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are some people on the extremes of both sides that don\u2019t like him, but he is Boris basically\" \u2014 A former vote leave figure talking about David Frost\n\n\u201cHe struck us as quite a genuine and sincere man. This was refreshing from dealing with his predecessor,\u201d Francois said.\n\nAt the London Chamber, Frost had been unafraid to hit back at businesses critical of Brexit \u2014 another factor that reassured Brexiteers he was on their side.\n\nIn an article for the Telegraph in July, he argued that business organizations appeared to be supporting policies they previously opposed \u201csuch as accepting the EU setting U.K. labor market rules, without any say from London, when they spent the last twenty years resisting just that.\u201d\n\nIn the same article, he also made the case for \u201creal risk-taking, developing new sectors, setting free those who want to make things happen rather than those who fear the future\u201d \u2014 a policy platform not dissimilar to Johnson\u2019s.\n\n\u201c[Frost] is the personification of Boris,\u201d the former Vote Leave figure said. \u201cThere are some people on the extremes of both sides that don\u2019t like him, but he is Boris basically \u2014 although, no offense, he is a bit less charismatic.\u201d\n\nWinning over Brussels\n\nFrost was on the front line of negotiations in Brussels, leading a team of between 25 to 30 people from No. 10, the U.K. representation in Brussels, and customs, regulatory and Northern Ireland experts.\n\nThe group were sustained on a bad diet of endless sandwiches and pizza, sometimes at the U.K.\u2019s Permanent Representation to the EU (UKRep), and sometimes provided by the Commission at the Berlaymont building.\n\nFrost was one of a three-strong negotiations leadership team, according to a figure familiar with the negotiations. He, the U.K. Representative in Brussels Tim Barrow and No. 10 adviser Beatrice Kilroy-Nolan, a former director at the Department for International Trade, traveled to and from the UKRep building and negotiations at the Commission in Barrow\u2019s grey Jaguar in the final days of talks.\n\nThe team held daily video conference calls with the prime minister to wrap up each day of negotiations, usually at about 11 p.m., to consider their options and take stock. The small team always concluded the day with a drink at Barrow\u2019s opulent Brussels residence, however late.\n\nOn last Thursday morning when the deal had been agreed, Barrow, Kilroy-Nolan and Frost stood around the fireplace in Barrow\u2019s residence with Johnson on the phone, a figure familiar with the talks said. Johnson agreed they should press for one more concession on VAT. Frost then spoke to the U.K.\u2019s EU exit strategy Cabinet committee to explain the deal by phone and they got the agreement to go ahead.\n\nHis negotiating counterparts saw Frost as \u201cconstructive\u201d but always doubted how much authority he commanded.\n\n\u201cThe Commission always made a point of telling us that, basically, he was not the problem in the whole saga,\u201d one EU diplomat said. \u201cAs in, it seemed that he genuinely tried to be constructive, but his mandate was so limited that there was only so much he could do, i.e. not much, unless/until there was a clear political shift.\u201d\n\nA second described him as a \u201ccompetent technocrat,\u201d but one who seemed to have \u201cnarrower margins to move than Robbins,\u201d though they acknowledged that he had ultimately \u201cdelivered.\u201d\n\nTrade concerns\n\nWhile Frost\u2019s stock is high in Downing Street, some of the U.K. parliament\u2019s most ardent Brexiteers are less enthusiastic.\n\nOne ERG member criticized Frost\u2019s decision to tinker with the existing Withdrawal Agreement.\n\n\u201cIt was his idea not to try and go for a free-trade agreement from day one but to renegotiate bits of the Withdrawal Agreement,\u201d the MP said. \u201cIt\u2019s personally not the way I would have gone about it.\u201d\n\nThe MP said it was \u201ccritical a different approach is taken\u201d in the second phase of negotiations \u201cbecause we are no longer fiddling with a deal, we have to establish sovereignty.\u201d\n\nA second MP said Frost, if he continued in the role, would need to bring in some \u201creally serious top-level trade expertise.\u201d", "description": "The prime minister has asked his EU adviser to lead the next stage of Brexit talks.", "authors": ["Annabelle Dickson", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Emilio Casalicchio", "David M.
