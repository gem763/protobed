When someone gets in my face, I think, \u2018[expletive], do I look like I want to talk?\u2019 \u201d\n\nKlein repeated the expletive \u2014 a Yiddish word \u2014 laughing. Then she repeated it again. She lit up.\n\n\u201cAfter that visit, my mom became more engaged and started eating and laughing again,\u201d said Modisett, who has taught comedy classes at the University of California at Los Angeles. \u201cShe felt that she was being seen.\u201d\n\nIn early 2017, realizing that other seniors with memory loss could also benefit from some slapstick and one-liners, Modisett launched Laughter on Call, an organization that pairs comedians with dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s patients. The group also puts on laughter workshops and live comedy shows at care centers.", "description": "", "authors": ["Beta.Washingtonpost.Com Lifestyle Comedians-Are-Being-Hired-By-Hour-Help-Dementia-Patients-Their-Goal-Full-Belly-Laugh"], "top_image": ""}
