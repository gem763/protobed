More than two dozen candidates in the diverse field, from prominent elder statesmen to political neophytes, started the journey, and some 18 remain.\n\nDemocratic debates with increasingly high qualification thresholds have sought to narrow the field and enlighten voters about candidate platforms from health care and climate change to gun laws, immigration and foreign policy.\n\nWith one year before the election, and barely three months until the first votes are cast in the nomination contest, beginning in Iowa, here are the must-know elements about the Democratic showdown.\n\n\u2013 Biden still leads \u2013\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden remains the man to beat despite several verbal miscues, his advancing age, halting debate performances and relentless attacks by Trump.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019m the frontrunner,\u201d Biden proclaimed to CBS on its \u201c60 Minutes\u201d show broadcast Sunday, pointing to the majority of polls that show him ahead.\n\n\u201cBut look, this is a marathon.\u201d\n\nDoubts have crept in about whether Biden, who served in the Senate for 36 years, can go the distance.\n\nHe turns 77 in three weeks, and for several minutes during a recent speech in Pennsylvania, his nostalgic childhood recollections suggested a longing for bygone days rather than eying the future.\n\nHe\u2019s getting swamped in the fundraising stakes by other campaigns. Biden\u2019s announced third-quarter haul trailed rivals Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg.\n\nBut Biden is drawing substantial support from two crucial voting blocs: African Americans loyal to him for his eight years serving with president Barack Obama, and working-class white men who see him as the best chance to defeat Trump.\n\n\u2013 Warren faces pushback \u2013\n\nSnapping at Biden\u2019s heels is Elizabeth Warren who, along with her liberal Senate colleague Bernie Sanders, has energized the progressive wing of the party.\n\nShe has ridden an uphill trajectory by intoning \u201cI have a plan for that\u201d \u2014 a pitch that signals she has thought out a broad swathe of policy proposals for improving the economy, expanding LGBTQ rights and reforming criminal justice.\n\nAs her popularity expanded, so did the political target on her back. At the October debate, rivals attacked her lack of clarity on how to pay for her universal health care proposal.\n\nMedicare for All\u2019s staggering cost is projected at between $14 and $34 trillion. Centrists such as Biden say the exorbitant cost is unworkable. Warren, 70, says she will release details soon.\n\n\u2013 Impeachment complications \u2013\n\nAs Democrats battle for supremacy, the rare political drama of impeachment is playing out in Washington.\n\nMost Democratic candidates are demanding Trump\u2019s ouster. But it is the very impeachment investigation, with its bombshell witness depositions, which is sucking up the political oxygen, denying 2020 campaigns the exposure they need to thrive.\n\nCaught in the crossfire is Biden. Trump stands accused of pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president.\n\nWhile there is no evidence of Biden wrongdoing, the appearance of poor ethical judgment could cloud Biden\u2019s path.\n\nA Trump impeachment would mean a trial in the Senate, severely complicating the campaigns of six senators who remain in the 2020 race but would be anchored to Washington during the proceedings.\n\n\u2013 Still hopeful \u2013\n\nBiden and Warren are dominating, but viable rivals remain.\n\nThey include Sanders, at 78 the oldest candidate, who is recovering from a heart attack suffered in early October.\n\nSanders, who narrowly trails Warren in the RealClearPolitics poll aggregate, is the race\u2019s most liberal, and has called for nothing less than a political revolution to rehabilitate America\u2019s working class.\n\nSenator Kamala Harris surged after the June debate where she confronted Biden, but she has struggled to remain in contention and slipped to fifth spot.\n\nButtigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has soared past her with a compelling performance in recent months. His centrist Midwestern realism has helped him gain traction.\n\n\u2013 Do-or-die \u2013\n\nLower-tier candidates are under tremendous pressure to claim a breakout moment, perhaps at the next debate November 20, or exit.\n\nObama-era cabinet member Julian Castro and Senator Cory Booker have repeatedly threatened to quit if they miss fundraising goals.\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang\u2019s surprisingly popular campaign and Senator Amy Klobuchar\u2019s resilient bid will likely survive into next year.\n\nBut those of ex-congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, Senator Michael Bennet, Montana Governor Steve Bullock and others appear to be on the chopping block.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 While US President Donald Trump plots a long one-year re-election campaign \u2014 and a bitter fight against impeachment \u2014", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/108ed8_democratic-us-presidential-hopefuls-senator-kamala-harris-senator-bernie-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
