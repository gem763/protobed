While marijuana is legal in California where Musk's September 2018 interview with Joe Rogan was conducted, it is illegal on a federal level, and federal employees and contractors are barred from using illegal drugs.\n\nSpace industry experts told Politico that there is no apparent precedent for NASA paying a contractor to conduct an internal review similar to the one SpaceX is reportedly undergoing. Boeing, which is competing with SpaceX to build a capsule to carry astronauts into space as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, was also required to conduct a workplace-culture review, but did not receive funding from NASA to do so, according to Politico's report.\n\nThe publication notes that Boeing received $1.7 billion (R25 billion) more from NASA for its Commercial Crew Program contract than SpaceX did.\n\nNASA told Politico that it is \"standard practice\" for contractors to receive extra funding for work that was not detailed in their original contract, but did not tell the publication why Boeing did not also receive funding for its workplace-culture review.\n\n\"As we understand it, NASA is moving forward with fulfilling the objectives of their safety assessment under our current contract, and we are prepared to help our customer meet those goals,\" a Boeing representative told Business Insider.\n\nNASA and SpaceX did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for comment.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Experts told Politico there is no clear precedent for NASA paying a contractor to conduct an internal review similar to the one SpaceX is undergoing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9486/f8129b2a08fc49179926fff1d2fe0710.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
