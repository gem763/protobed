With respect, I view the first respondent as now being deliberately set on a path \u2013 triggered by some unknown event \u2013 to disrupt if not destroy the ATM using unlawful means,\u201d said Zungula.\n\nMagashule\u2019s defamation case against Ngqulwana got another boost as another former co-conspirator of Ngqulwana\u2019s, Daluxolo Hoho, also came out in defence of the ANC secretary general. Hoho was both a member of the SACMCC and Ngqulwana\u2019s own church, the Ntsikane Church.\n\nIn an affidavit filed with the SA Human Rights Commission on July 23, Hoho accuses Ngqulwana of manipulating both sides of the ANC functions \u2013 those who endorsed Dlamini-Zuma for the ANC presidency in 2017 and those who supported Cyril Ramaphosa.\n\nHoho claims in his affidavit that just under a month before the May 8 national and provincial elections, he and a delegation of SACMCC leaders met Ramaphosa, ANC head of elections Fikile Mbalula, ANC member of Parliament Dumisani Ximbi and former minister of community safety in the Western Cape Leonard Ramatlakane \u201cat a hotel in Port Elizabeth\u201d.\n\nHe claims that Ngqulwana led the SACMCC delegation, which solicited R700 000 from Ximbi and Ramatlakane at this meeting.\n\n\u201cI am very concerned with this investigation that the ANC claims to be doing on Ace Magashule ... Apostle Buyisile Ngqulwana was given R700 000 by Ximbi and Ramatlakane before the May elections, the purpose was to destroy the ATM and he did that ... Isn\u2019t that enough punishment on Magashule?\u201d\n\n\u201cApostle Ngqulwana is in the money-making game here ... He wanted money from the ANC to form the ATM and later wanted money from the same ANC to destroy the same ATM he wanted to be funded to form ... What is that called? \u201cI have been working very close with Apostle Ngqulwana, such that I was part of those people he went with to meet with the ANC president Baba Ramaphosa in a hotel in Port Elizabeth on April 14 before the May elections,\u201d Hoho said.\n\nA picture of Ramaphosa, Hoho and Ngqulwana has been widely circulated online.\n\nHoho told City Press that the photograph was taken on the day in question, following the meeting in Port Elizabeth.\n\nThe presidency has denied any involvement.\n\nHead of the presidency Sibongile Besani declined to comment on whether Ramaphosa met the SACMCC delegation or not.\n\nInstead she said: \u201cA commission has been set up by the governing party to ascertain if there are any ANC members who had a hand in the formation of the ATM.\n\n\u201cThese allegations [by Hoho] fall under the scope of this commission and should be directed to the commission,\u201d said Besani.\n\nXimbi and Ramatlakane told City Press that they never met either Ngqulwana or Hoho and denied giving money to the former. Ngqulwana described Hoho as an aggrieved \u201cliar who has a score to settle\u201d.\n\nHoho\u2019s allegations have, however, shift the narrative.\n\nInitially former president Jacob Zuma, Magashule and other ANC members who backed Dlamini-Zuma leading up to the Nasrec elective conference were seen as protagonists in the formation of the ATM.\n\nHis claims are now implicating a whole host of other players in the Ramaphosa faction as having been vested in the formation of the rival party.\n\nTALK TO US\n\nDo you think the ATM leader\u2019s affidavit clarifies his party\u2019s role in ANC infighting?
