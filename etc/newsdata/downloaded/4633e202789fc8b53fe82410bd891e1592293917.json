NAB cited its \"belief\" in Wisr's business model of creating \"financial wellness\", as it tries to reduce over-indebtedness.\n\nWisr shares rose by as much as 4\u00a2, or 30 per cent, on Monday after it told the ASX NAB would provide an initial $50 million debt warehouse program - which may be scaled up to $200 million - to help the non-bank lender originate more loans. The shares settled to close up 1.5\u00a2 or 12 per cent at 14\u00a2.\n\nThe warehouse deal comes a month after NAB did a $57 million warehouse deal, scalable to $250 million, with personal lender Symple Loans, which intends to ramp up lending in competition with NAB and the other major banks.\n\nThe deals form part of NAB's commitment to provide $2 billion of debt funding to technology start-ups, including fintechs looking to take on the banks.\n\nBut Wisr's model is potentially more disruptive to the majors than simply backing alternative lenders. It not only has a credit business but has created an application to help people cut their debt. Wisr recognises this may put pressure on its own personal lending earnings, but is hopeful the approach will build loyalty to win future customers.\n\n\"We have created tools, apps, services and podcasts to help our customers pay down debt faster, not just for our personal loans but with any bank in Australia,\" said Wisr CEO Anthony Nantes. \"By building a model orientated to the customer, an outcome might be less margin, but we could grow a bigger business as a result as customers lean into us.\"", "description": "NAB is a believer in the business model of Wisr, a small ASX-listed player seeking to reduce consumer debt.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4568%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_288%2C$y_377/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3fa0d3d8313035c1c49f08b5fba65cf7632e7415", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
