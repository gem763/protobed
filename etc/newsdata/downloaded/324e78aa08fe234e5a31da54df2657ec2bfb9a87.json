It was not until moments before play on Tuesday that her fortunes changed as a withdrawal by Maria Sakkari offered her a place in the first round as a lucky loser.\n\nHeather Watson powers into first WTA final in over three years Read more\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still overwhelmed and shocked,\u201d she said afterwards. \u201cI guess it\u2019s crazy to say it\u2019s my first WTA title. This was definitely not on the calendar at the beginning of the year, because I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have a chance to get in, and now I\u2019m the champion. It\u2019s just insane that I got in as a lucky loser and now I\u2019m the champion. My dad told me when I got in, before the first main\u2011draw match, he said: \u2018You can\u2019t lose twice in the same tournament.\u2019 I\u2019m sure he never thought it would come this far, to being the champion, but I guess he was right.\u201d\n\nGauff had grabbed the opportunity in Austria with both hands, piecing together a brilliant run underlined by her startling 7-6(1), 6-4 win against the top seed and world No 8 Kiki Bertens in the quarter-final. For all the hype around her, Gauff had never previously defeated a top-40 player.\n\nIn the final, Gauff neutralised the searing power of the 2017 French Open champion Ostapenko with her speed and variety, drawing errors from the erratic Latvian throughout.\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nBy the third set, Gauff\u2019s average forehand speed registered only 55mph compared with Ostapenko\u2019s 75mph, a reflection of the intelligent slices from the American that tripped up her opponent throughout.\n\nGauff\u2019s rise has been underlined by a maturity that belies her age, but as she closed in on her first WTA title, she finally resembled the 15-year-old girl she is. At 5-0 in the third set, Gauff failed to convert two championship points and then she panicked.\n\nShe immediately lost her serve for 5-2 before calling her father and coach, Corey Gauff, on to the court. As she asked him what to do, he calmed his daughter down with a pep talk, and parted with some pointed words: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to sprint to the finish line. We\u2019re going to walk there.\u201d\n\nAfter finishing the 2018 season ranked 875th, Gauff will now rise to the top 75. She is the youngest American victor on the WTA tour since 1991. She may have walked slowly to the finish line here, but her young career so far has been a blinding sprint to the top.", "description": "Fifteen-year-old Coco Gauff continued her extraordinary breakthrough year by defeating Jelena Ostapenko 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 to win her first WTA title in Linz", "authors": ["Tumaini Carayol"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bba34d9b685f2892d0f28b376aa749aeeaa5d11/0_150_2417_1450/master/2417.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=19b1c928a95eed18e5b15db5288db70f", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
