Arcega-Whiteside had his hands up and his eyes on the ball as the potential go-ahead touchdown pass came the rookie receiver\u2019s way.\n\nCatching it was the problem.\n\nCarson Wentz threaded the ball to Arcega-Whiteside, who failed to haul in the pass with a defender on him, one of a handful of drops that doomed the Philadelphia Eagles in a 27-24 loss Sunday to the Detroit Lions.\n\nThis one stung in the clutch - Arcega-Whiteside dropped the pass on fourth down with 49 seconds left, the second straight week the Eagles failed to make the pivotal catch down the stretch for a win.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the moment you ask for and dream about,\u201d Arcega-Whiteside said. \u201cI gotta make the play.\u201d\n\nWentz was nearly running out of receiving options. Wide receivers Alshon Jeffery (calf) and DeSean Jackson (groin) both sat out with injuries and tight end Dallas Goedert had also been slowed by a calf injury.\n\nLions cornerback Rashaan Melvin may have gotten a hand on the ball that led to final of several drops in the game for Eagles receivers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no other assessment other than, I\u2019ve got to go get it,\u201d Whiteside said. \u201cTight coverage. I was going to elevate, expected some contact. There really wasn\u2019t no contact. The ball ended up right there. I have to make the play.\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s comeback again was derailed by drops.\n\nThe Eagles lost at Atlanta last week when Nelson Agholor lost the ball in the lights of the retractable-roof stadium and let a potential go-ahead 60-yard score slip through his hands.\n\nAgholor had two TD catches against the Lions, but fumbled the ball when he knocked it off his hip on a catch in the second quarter. Darius Slay returned it 38 yards to the Eagles 22 as Wentz dove to make the tackle. The defense held and Matt Prater kicked a 33-yarder to make it 20-10.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the game,\u201d Wentz said. \u201cGuys are going to drop passes. We\u2019re going to put the ball on the ground. I\u2019m going to throw picks. We\u2019re going to miss reads. Things happen. Guys make mistakes. Any time somebody drops a pass or something like that, I make sure I go right up to them and tell them it\u2019s coming your way next time.\u201d\n\nGoedert had minimal action but dropped a 26-yard TD pass in the fourth, a gut-punch until he was bailed out on the drive when Wentz hit Agholor for a score that pulled the Eagles to 27-24.\n\nJackson and Jeffery are both unlikely to play against the Packers, forcing the receivers left to become reliable.\n\n\u201cI got double-teamed almost every passing play,\u201d tight end Zach Ertz said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to get them back, hopefully as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThe Eagles stumbled on routine plays to fall into a 1-2 hole headed into a short week with a game Thursday night at Green Bay.\n\nOn the Eagles\u2019 final drive, Darren Sproles caught a fourth-and-5 pass for a first down but got called for their third offensive pass interference penalty.\n\nWideout Mack Hollins also committed two pass-interference penalties. Miles Sanders - who had his helmet ripped off on a kickoff return - also lost one of two fumbles.\n\n\u201cJust told him we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in him, we\u2019ve got a lot of trust in him,\u201d coach Doug Pederson said of Sanders. \u201cWe kept him out there. It\u2019s the only way to have trust and confidence in a player is to keep him out there.\u201d\n\nSanders repeated a familiar refrain in Philadelphia\u2019s locker room: He just has to put the mistakes behind him.\n\n\u201cI got back in and tried to make the best of my opportunity,\u201d he said.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t alone in his imperfections. The Eagles were a disaster all over the field, and even allowed Jamal Agnew to return a kickoff 100 yards for a score. The Eagles still have only two sacks in three games after they came up empty against Matthew Stafford.\n\nEagles defensive end Brandon Graham turned to reporters as walked into the locker room and said, \u201cYou better believe we\u2019re coming back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just letting people know we\u2019re just standing tall through it all,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "J.J.
