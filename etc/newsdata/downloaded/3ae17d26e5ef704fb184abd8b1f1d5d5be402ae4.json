(AP) - When the New York Jets called New England earlier this month to inquire about trading for wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, it was a long shot considering Bill Belichick hadn\u2019t once traded during his Patriots coaching tenure with the team he infamously resigned from after one day as head coach in 2000.\n\nBut Jets coach Adam Gase recalls New York general manager Joe Douglas being optimistic about the prospect in the aftermath of New England signing four-time All-Pro receiver Antonio Brown.\n\nThomas, who played under Gase when he was offensive coordinator in Denver in 2013 and \u201814, was a perfect fit for an offense the first-year Jets coach felt needed a boost after a season-opening loss to Buffalo.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to figure out, \u2018How could we go about this?\u2019\u201d Gase recalled. \u201cI think to Joe\u2019s credit, he was like, \u2018I\u2019m just going to call him and the worst they could say is no.\u2019 And when they said, \u2018Let\u2019s talk,\u2019 then those guys worked it out.\u201d\n\nBelichick acknowledged that the stars aligned perfectly to make a rare deal between the AFC East foes possible.\n\n\u201cI would say, a certain period of time when there\u2019s no way this transaction would\u2019ve happened,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cThey\u2019re not the easiest trades to make, but, you know, if the trade is good for both teams and ultimately what we\u2019re trying to do is improve our team.\u201d\n\nIt may be the only bit of kindness Belichick shows New York (0-2) when it arrives at Gillette Stadium for Sunday\u2019s matchup.\n\nThe Patriots (2-0) ran through Pittsburgh and Miami in their first two games, outscoring them 76-3 in a pair of routs .\n\nNow they face a Jets team against which they have won six straight games and eight consecutive regular-season games in New England. The Jets beat the Patriots in Foxborough in the playoffs in the 2010 season, but haven\u2019t won a regular-season game there since 2008.\n\nThe Jets opened as an 18-point underdog. The line quickly grew to 23 by early in the week.\n\nAsked this week if he\u2019s ever gone into a game with his opponent favored by that much, Gase smiled.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Gase said. \u201cI was in Detroit five years.\u201d\n\nSome things to know as the two AFC East rivals square off in the first of two meetings this season:\n\nNEXT UP\n\nLuke Falk will make his first NFL start after making his debut last Monday night against Cleveland.\n\nThe 24-year-old quarterback was on the practice squad a week ago, but was promoted to the active roster a few hours before the game. That was because Sam Darnold is recovering from mononucleosis . Trevor Siemian started against the Browns, but is now out for the season after injuring ankle ligaments. Falk went 20 of 25 for 198 yards after replacing Siemian.\n\nGase chose to stick with Falk as the starter - until Darnold returns in a few weeks. Falk was with Gase last season in Miami.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very confident in his abilities,\u201d Gase said of Falk. \u201cHe\u2019s confident in his intelligence, and he\u2019s able to take things from the classroom with no reps and go out and execute. Obviously, being in the system for two years now, he has a really good grasp of it.\u201d\n\nRARE DOMINANCE\n\nThe Patriots are the only team in the NFL yet to give up a TD and are just the fourth team in the Super Bowl era to allow three points or fewer through their first two games. The previous one was 1981 Buffalo Bills.\n\nON THE CORNER\n\nTrumaine Johnson entered the season as the Jets\u2018 No. 1 cornerback. He opened the team\u2019s second game on the sideline - and stayed there most of the game.\n\nJohnson, who signed a five-year, $72.5 million deal last year, was replaced in the lineup by Nate Hairston. And, it appears that could be the case against the Patriots.\n\n\u201cIt just hasn\u2019t worked out as well as we need it to,\u201d Gase said of Johnson\u2019s benching. \u201cThe good thing is we\u2019ve got a long ways to go.\u201d\n\nJohnson didn\u2019t play until late in the fourth quarter when Hairston dealt with cramps. Johnson acknowledged after the game against the Browns and again during the week that he was \u201cupset\u201d by the team\u2019s decision. He insisted, though, he just wants to do what\u2019s best for the team to help them win.\n\n\u201cWhen my number\u2019s called,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cI\u2019ll be ready to play.\u201d\n\nO-LINE SHUFFLE\n\nNew England\u2019s offensive line took another hit this week when starting left tackle Isaiah Wynn was placed on injured reserve .\n\nWynn hurt a foot during the Patriots\u2019 43-0 win at Miami. This is the second straight season Wynn has been placed on IR. A preseason Achilles tendon injury caused him to miss his entire rookie season in 2018.\n\nIt comes after starting center David Andrews went on IR before the season opener with blood clots in his lungs. Starting right tackle Marcus Cannon also sat out last week after injuring his shoulder in the win over Pittsburgh.\n\nMarshall Newhouse, who was signed last week, started in Cannon\u2019s place against Miami. He is likely to get nod this week if Cannon remains out.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Dennis Waszak Jr. In New York contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Kyle Hightower on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/khightower\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When the New York Jets called New England earlier this month to inquire about trading for wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, it was a long shot considering Bill Belichick hadn't once traded during his Patriots coaching tenure with the team he infamously resigned from after one day as head coach in 2000.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kyle Hightower"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/patriots_football_41403_c0-164-3916-2447_s1770x1032.jpg?87a16e4300f1aeafbca471c6ea471a8397568288", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
