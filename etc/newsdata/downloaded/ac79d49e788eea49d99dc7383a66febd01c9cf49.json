Player ratings: England vs Tonga 1/33 England vs Tonga player ratings Getty 2/33 England AP 3/33 Elliot Daly - 7 Two good runs that gave England good field position, and a lovely pass for May to run onto in the lead up to Tuilagi\u2019s second try. But at fault for not being deep enough off Slade\u2019s pass that would have bagged him his own try. Getty Images 4/33 Anthony Watson - 7 Quiet game until he exploded into life late on with a mazy run from his own 22 to the Tongan 22, leaving defender after defender in his wake. AFP/Getty Images 5/33 Manu Tuilagi - 9 The star performer by a country mile. First try was born out of his brute strength as he burst through a tackle attempt from Kalamafoni and carried two over the line with him. Second try was more of a case of right place, right time, and he was a constant problem for Tonga to deal with all afternoon. AFP/Getty Images 6/33 Owen Farrell - 6 Pretty quiet throughout and missed his first conversion effort, but had one good run in the lead up to Tuilagi\u2019s opener. World Rugby via Getty Images 7/33 Jonny May - 7 Nice break and awareness to set up Tuilagi for his second try. Made a strong tackle on Tuitavake in the second half, but left the field with what looked like an injury soon after. EPA 8/33 George Ford - 6 Failed to get much going as a blunt England attack took too long to get firing. More was expected from the Ford-Farrell combination. Getty Images 9/33 Ben Youngs - 6 Fairly quiet throughout, though could have been a little different had he managed to ground the ball when he took a quick penalty. Replaced short of the hour by Willi Heinz. REUTERS 10/33 Joe Marler - 7 Strong work in the scum as England were rarely tested, but didn\u2019t manage to get through much carrying. World Rugby via Getty Images 11/33 Jamie George - 8 Excellent in the lineout as he hit all of his throws in an area where England are dominating the game. Looked to shake off an ankle niggle and was replaced soon after by Luke Cowan-Dickie, who was on hand to score the final try. PA 12/33 Kyle Sinckler - 6 Like Marler, a solid shift in the front row but guilty of conceding the first penalty in an ill-disciplined start to the match. World Rugby via Getty Images 13/33 Courtney Lawes - 7 Not as prominent as Itoje but still got through plenty of carrying for the side. PA 14/33 Maro Itoje - 8 Excellent in the air as George repeatedly went to him, and managed to pinch one of Tonga\u2019s throws along with sealing a turnover from a lineout maul. Carried well and got through plenty of defensive work. World Rugby via Getty Images 15/33 Tom Curry - 7 Lead the charge with 15 tackles but will need to up his work-rate with the ball in hand. Getty Images 16/33 Sam Underhill - 8 England\u2019s most prominent forward, winning a penalty at the breakdown and also managing to seal a turnover when first into the ruck. Unlucky not to score a try as his effort was held up by the slimmest of margins. Getty Images 17/33 Billy Vunipola - 6 Will be feeling the effects of Zane Kapeli\u2019s enormous tackle on him in the opening exchanges, and slightly faded from the game following the hit.

I remember making my first start for England and Jonny was involved and playing in Australia.\n\n\u201cHe's an icon of the game and to get this accolade is pretty cool. It's gone quick and I remember when I first started - some of the players like Simon Shaw told me to enjoy it because it would go so fast. It does go quick, but it has been enjoyable ride at times and it is good.\u201d\n\nThat experienced across the squad helped them to remain composed enough to secure a bonus-point win on Sunday when at one stage it looked like they would miss out on a maximum haul. The same will be expected in Kobe on Thursday, even though the USA are two places higher in the world rankings than Tonga, such are the lofty heights that England are aiming for.\n\nThe USA do have a different type of experience though: an English one. Five of their starting line-up ply their trade in the Premiership, while captain Blaine Scully spent two years with Leicester Tigers before the last World Cup alongside both Youngs and Cole.\n\nBut England aren\u2019t lacking in knowledge when it comes to the Eagles, either. Current defence coach John Mitchell was the man who steered them to World Cup qualification before leaving the team in the hands of Gary Gold, the former Worcester director of rugby.\n\n\"Mitch made an indelible mark on USA rugby,\u201d Gold said after naming his team on Monday. \u201cFirstly, the reason we\u2019re here is because of Mitch. He led that team over two years ago to World Cup qualification, so nice and early with lots of time to prepare. From day one, we\u2019ve been working towards this thanks to John.\n\n\"He brought a lot of structure, he brought a lot of intellect, he brought a great work ethic. For me, other than the fact that he\u2019s a friend of mine and an old acquaintance on and off the rugby field, it\u2019s been a privilege to take over from a guy like him because you know that a lot of the ethos and the principles within this team are thanks to him.\"\n\nGold had plenty to say on what he wants his own team to do. \"We have a style of play and areas of strengths that we\u2019re pretty confident we\u2019re quite good at and I think we need to impose that. If we go away from that and try to play a style of play we\u2019re not accustomed to, or we allow England to dictate the terms of the game, then it\u2019s going to be a tough evening for us.\"\n\nBut he would not allow himself to be drawn into a verbal back-and-forth with Eddie Jones following his claim that the USA would be \u201clike 15 Donald Trumps out there\u201d.\n\n\"I\u2019ve absolutely no idea what he means by that,\u201d responded Gold. \u201cWe\u2019re just a team that\u2019s really got to focus on our own processes at the moment. We\u2019ve got to worry about what we do when we get onto the rugby field.\n\n\"At this stage, with all due respect, we\u2019re not a good enough rugby team to be making comments or answers to questions like that. I don\u2019t know what it means.\"\n\nJones will name his squad on Tuesday morning, where he is expected to make a number of changes to the side even though a fair few of Sunday\u2019s team will be required to double up for their second game inside four days.\n\nUnited States: Will Hooley; Blaine Scully, Marcel Brache, Paul Lasike, Martin Iosefo; AJ MacGinty, Shaun Davies; David Ainuu, Joe Taufete\u2019e, Titi Lamositele; Ben Landry, Nick Civetta; Tony Lamborn, John Quill, Cam Dolan.\n\nReplacements: Dylan Fawsitt, Olive Kilifi, Paul Mullen, Greg Peterson, Hanco Germishuys, Ruben de Haas, Bryce Campbell, Mike Te\u2019o.", "description": "The United States\u00a0team selected by Gary Gold on Monday holds just 333 caps of experience across the starting XV.
