Forensic palynologists are working to track down the origins of illicit drug shipments by studying pollen samples. (Taylor Glascock for The Washington Post)\n\nIn a small, obscure government laboratory here, two self-described \u201cnerds\u201d are doing microscopic detective work, trying to determine the origins of the major narcotics shipments that U.S. agents intercept at the border.\n\nAndrew Laurence, 33, and Shannon Ferguson, 32, are forensic palynologists who specialize in the identification of pollen grains. They can extract the particles from almost anything \u2014 drug packages, clothing, the air filters of impounded vehicles \u2014 and use that information to determine where an item might have traveled. Pollen grains stick to objects in abundance, and the precise combination of those particles creates what forensic palynologists call a \u201csignal,\u201d not unlike a fingerprint.\n\n\u201cThe concept is pretty simple: All plants have a unique pollen grain,\u201d said Laurence, who was hired by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in 2012 to establish the lab. \u201cEach region is made up of different plants, or the same plants in different abundances \u2014 percentages on the landscape. So every part of the world is going to have a different pollen print.\u201d\n\nThe palynologists\u2019 work is of growing interest to the government at a time when record quantities of hard narcotics are flooding into the United States, often with little indication of their source or smuggling routes. Laurence and Ferguson are at the forefront of helping CBP determine, for example, whether shipments of deadly fentanyl seized at the border were made in Mexico or may have originated in China.\n\n[How fentanyl flowed over the border through the U.S. Postal Service]\n\nThe technique also has applications for counterterrorism and other national security purposes, Laurence said, such as testing material found on explosives or criminal suspects. But Laurence said he couldn\u2019t talk about that part of the job.\n\nLaurence, who was recruited when he was a graduate student in archaeology at Texas A&M, said pollen grains can help CBP reconstruct the \u201ctravel history\u201d of an item. Sometimes the sample reflects a broad geographic area, so the information is of limited use, but he says other items can be traced to a specific region or subregion.\n\n\n\nA microscope is hooked up to a computer at the CBP pollen lab in Chicago. (Taylor Glascock for The Washington Post)\n\nBorder Patrol agents also have been sending in soil samples from the field, allowing Laurence and Ferguson to build detailed pollen maps of the U.S.-Mexico border that might help identify where shipments crossed.\n\nThe information is not used for criminal prosecution, Laurence said, but it is valuable for \u201cintelligence and investigative leads.\u201d While investigators traditionally rely on interviews and informants to reveal trafficking patterns and the sources of narcotics, the CBP pollen lab can help substantiate that information or cast doubt on its veracity.\n\nNeele Shepard, a chemist who has worked for 18 years in CBP\u2019s narcotics lab identifying the chemical substances in seized drug loads, called the pollen analysis \u201can innovative new approach to collecting intelligence.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one has ever been able to say, \u2018Hey, can you figure out where this brick came from?\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\nLaurence said most of the samples he is asked to identify now are fentanyl. Wearing hazmat suits, respirator masks and other protective gear, he and Ferguson will sometimes dissolve an entire kilogram brick in hydrofluoric acid and other chemicals, then separate out pollen grains using centrifuges.\n\n\n\nCustoms and Border Protection Officer Mohammed Rahman holds a bag filled with white powder \u2014 later determined to be fentanyl \u2014 at the JFK International Mail Facility in 2018 in New York. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nLaurence said he is not authorized to discuss geographic trends in the fentanyl samples he is studying. But such information carries geopolitical significance at a time when the United States has been touting drug enforcement cooperation with China despite the deepening trade dispute between the countries.\n\nThe U.S. State Department also produces annual reports evaluating other nations\u2019 counternarcotics efforts and their place in the illicit drug trade, assessments that can have implications for foreign aid, trade practices and cargo inspections.\n\nAfter Laurence and Ferguson separate the pollen from other particulate matter on their samples, they inject dye so they can view the granular structure under microscopes. Many of the grains are instantly familiar, especially from tree species such as pine and oak that are wind-dispersed and scattered across the planet.\n\nThe researchers are looking for the percentages of those species in combination with more distinctive grains, particularly from plants with material that is not part of the ambient \u201cpollen rain.\u201d\n\n\n\nChemist Hana Blazej takes detailed notes on her findings at the CBP lab on Wednesday. (Taylor Glascock for The Washington Post)\n\nThe CBP in-house reference library has about 6,000 pollen types, and Laurence and Ferguson have access to an additional 30,000 samples nearby at the Field Museum of Natural History in downtown Chicago. Worldwide, there are about 380,000 types of pollen grain, Laurence said.\n\n\u201cWe can always tell you the general environment, like the mesquite grasslands of Mexico, or the Great Basin of North America,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the worst-case scenario, if that\u2019s all we can say, where it\u2019s these large environments and there\u2019s nothing unique about it.\u201d\n\nAbout 70 percent of what they find is composed of grain types in their reference library, but Laurence said there are many parts of the world that remain \u201cblack holes,\u201d including parts of the Middle East, where there has been little mapping done.\n\nWhen the CBP palynologists are not studying material from drug seizures, they often assist state and local authorities on hard-to-solve homicide investigations, including cold cases. Pollen molecules are extremely durable, so the grains remain intact on decades-old crime-scene evidence.\n\n\u201cPollen itself is best described as a flying fossil,\u201d Laurence said.\n\n\u201cNature\u2019s plastic,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cYou can\u2019t get rid of it.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Laurence and Ferguson helped crack the high-profile Bella Bond murder case in Massachusetts, after the body of an unidentified toddler was found in Boston Harbor. State police sent Laurence garments and hair samples, and he was able to identify grains from two types of rare cedar trees that were in a Boston-area arboretum.\n\nThe discovery helped police narrow their search to a specific area of Boston, where they eventually arrested the child\u2019s mother and her boyfriend, who lived near the arboretum. The boyfriend was convicted of second-degree murder, and the mother was convicted of being an accessory after the fact.\n\nMore recently, Laurence and Ferguson worked on a 37-year-old homicide case from Ohio, identifying pollen from the crime scene, and the victim was finally identified in combination with DNA testing.\n\nA relatively abstruse area of research to begin with, palynology produces few graduates, and Laurence and Ferguson said most PhD candidates are immediately hired by oil companies. When they are spending tens of millions of dollars per day to drill deep under the ocean, the companies employ palynologists to test organic material from core samples to determine the geological strata, so engineers can direct crews to go deeper or pull back.\n\n\n\nPollen samples that have been counted and reported at the CBP lab. (Taylor Glascock for The Washington Post)\n\nPalynologist Shannon Ferguson holds a vacuum sample at the lab. (Taylor Glascock for The Washington Post)\n\nFerguson joined Laurence in 2015 while she was completing her geology PhD at Louisiana State University. Ferguson said she liked the real-world application of forensic palynology.\n\n\u201cIn geology, as a student, I was only focusing on stuff that happened thousands of years ago, which was interesting, too,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is more rewarding in a way because it\u2019s happening now. It can affect people\u2019s lives. It can help people.\u201d\n\nThe palynologists working for Exxon or Shell earn many times more than those in government labs like the CBP facility in Chicago. \u201cBasically, you have to be an idealist to work on the government side,\u201d Laurence said. They are trying to recruit more palynologists to the CBP lab because their current backlog of cases is 18 months to two years.\n\nAt Texas A&M, Laurence wrote his dissertation on \u201cancient starches,\u201d analyzing material from earthen ovens to identify what grains were being cooked. His mentor, Vaughn Bryant, began promoting forensic palynology in the 1970s, after learning about its application in New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\n\nBryant often worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture to identify the origins of honey samples because importers will sometimes purchase cheap honey abroad and repackage it as a local product to boost the price.\n\nBryant said he got little traction promoting the law enforcement potential for forensic palynology until the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, then spent a decade analyzing samples for U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\n\u201cThe next thing that happened was, I got call from the Department of Homeland Security, and they said: \u2018Do you think you could help us find out where this marijuana is coming from?\u2019 \u201d\n\nBryant said he began working for DHS around 2006 and was soon testing a range of narcotics samples from seizures. But he already had a full-time job teaching and doing research. \u201cI started talking to DHS, and they said they\u2019d be willing to fund a graduate student to learn how to do it. Andy was that student.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I tell people is this: When forensic palynology works, it\u2019s fantastic, but doesn\u2019t work all the time,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cIt\u2019s just one tool to use to complement other forensic applications. It\u2019s just one technique you can apply.\u201d\n\nBryant, 78, said he has terminal cancer, but he has been heartened to see his protege, Laurence, continue the work.\n\n\u201cI felt like Moses, wandering the desert for 40 years,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until we had a major catastrophe until someone listened, and after that, they couldn\u2019t get enough info.\u201d\n\n\u201cFederal agencies finally woke up to fact that this stuff can be very useful,\u201d he said.", "description": "Palynologists in a Chicago lab can help identify the origin of heroin, fentanyl and other drugs crossing the U.S. border.", "authors": ["Nick Miroff", "Reporter Covering Immigration Enforcement", "The Department Of Homeland Security", "Nick Miroff Covers Immigration Enforcement", "The Department Of Homeland Security For The Washington Post.
