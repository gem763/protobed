She has not held one daily briefing and says she has no plans to.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that says the White House has to hold daily press briefings. In fact, they\u2019ve only been around since 1995, inaugurated by former President Clinton\u2019s press secretary Mike McCurry. They were continued under former Presidents George W. Bush and Obama. Why? Because they proved so valuable \u2014 to the public and to the president.\n\nContrary to what Trump supporters want us to believe, the people hurt most by the lack of daily briefings are not White House reporters, who don\u2019t get their chance to preen on camera every day. The real losers are, first of all, the American people, who don\u2019t get their daily look behind the curtain to know what the government\u2019s up to, or how their tax dollars are being spent.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the other big loser, even if they don\u2019t realize it, is the Trump administration itself, which loses the daily opportunity to get its message out, set its own priorities, explain and defend its programs, and rebut any criticism, all from the power of the White House podium \u2014 in the voice of a seasoned professional press spokesperson.\n\nAnd never was the damage done by canceling the daily briefings more apparent than last Thursday\u2019s briefing room appearance by acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney John (Mick) Michael MulvaneyTrump urges GOP to fight for him Bill Press: Mulvaney proves need for daily briefings Gingrich calls for eliminating White House press corps in wake of Mulvaney briefing MORE. It was amateur hour at the worst. Mulvaney was out of his element, unprepared and woefully incapable of parrying even the most obvious reporters\u2019 question.\n\nWhite House reporters were quickly summoned to the briefing room so Mulvaney could announce the location of next year\u2019s Group of Seven (G-7) summit. After considering every other possible venue, he reported with a straight face, the White House had decided that the best and only place in the entire 50 states to hold the summit was the President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump says he doesn't want NYT in the White House Veterans group backs lawsuits to halt Trump's use of military funding for border wall Schiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails MORE-owned National Doral golf course. But there was no conflict of interest, he insisted, because the event would be held \u201cat cost.\u201d An argument so patently unbelievable and outrageous that Trump himself pulled the plug on it two days later \u2014 leaving Mulvaney with egg on his face.\n\nBut things only went downhill from there. Next, Mulvaney, totally clueless, waded into Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, telling ABC\u2019s Jonathan Karl that, of course, there was a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d involved: aid for dirt. We do it all the time, he insisted. \u201cGet over it!\u201d Later, of course, he tried to deny admitting a quid pro quo. Only one problem: He\u2019d done so live, on national television. Play the tape.\n\nFor Trump, it was a public relations disaster, with grave consequences. Rep.

It could have all been avoided if Trump had a professional press team, skilled in dealing with reporters, holding daily briefings. Instead, he occasionally sends out amateur players like Mulvaney or worse yet, holds court with reporters himself before walking to his helicopter.\n\nFor his own sake, three things Trump should do: Shut up. Bring back the daily briefings. And fire Mulvaney.\n\nPress is host of \u201cThe Bill Press Pod.\u201d He is author of \u201cFrom the Left: A Life in the Crossfire.\u201d", "description": "Today marks a milestone.
