A few weeks ago, I went on a rollercoaster with my kids at Peppa Pig World.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something I would never have done before the operation, because it would have risked exposing my forehead.\n\n\u201cThe ride was going fast, the wind was blowing back my hair back, and I literally did not have a care in the world.\n\n(Image: Marco/Richards)\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realise how much that feeling would mean to me. Looking back, one result of my body hang-up was that I never took photos with my children.\n\n\u201cI actually have very few photos with my son. He\u2019s five now, and yet there\u2019s hardly any shots of us both together. It\u2019s not a nice feeling for me.\n\n\u201cBut since the operation, I\u2019m making up for lost time.\u201d\n\nBorn with naturally afro-textured hair, Carla would scrape it back into a ponytail during her school years.\n\nShe says that triggered a phenomena known as \u2018traction alopecia\u2019 - where repeated strain on hair follicles can trigger irreversible hair loss.\n\n(Image: Marco/Richards)\n\nIt\u2019s common among those with heavy dreadlocks, hair extensions and cornrows and can also be caused by excessively tight ponytails.\n\nCarla said: \u201cThere was one picture that I had taken at the swimming pool in our school.\n\n\u201cIt was a summer\u2019s day and the sun was literally reflecting off my forehead to the point that it looked like a solar panel.\n\n\u201cI got called \u2018slaphead\u2019 and \u2018fivehead\u2019. It\u2019s just kids being kids, but their words stung.\n\n\u201cAnd by the time I was 15 or 16, I began to feel really self-conscious.\u201d\n\n(Image: Marco/Richards)\n\nFrom then on Carla would style her hair into a big side fringe and wouldn\u2019t let anyone stroke her head out of fear her forehead would be exposed.\n\nShe adds: \u201cI was very conscious that all the other girls didn\u2019t have big foreheads.\n\n\u201cI thought that was why boys were not attracted to me as much as my friends. I basically blamed my forehead for everything.\u201d\n\nThe insecurities extended to her wedding day in 2016.\n\nCarla said: \u201cI specifically remember saying to the hairdresser, my hair has to be styled into a big side fringe.\n\n(Image: Marco/Richards)\n\n\u201cIt was windy on my wedding day as well, so I was paranoid. Thankfully they put so much hairspray on it didn\u2019t shift.\u201d\n\nSo unhappy about how her forehead was making her feel, Carla researched her options and stumbled upon hairline lowering surgery.\n\nThe operation was performed by surgeon Christopher Inglefield at the London Bridge Plastic Surgery.\n\nA portion of the forehead skin is removed before the scalp is brought forward by around 3cm and reattached.\n\nThe incisions - cut in a delicate, slight zig-zag - are placed in the natural hairline so they\u2019re as hidden as possible.\n\n(Image: Marco/Richards)\n\nCarla said: \u201cI literally googled \u2018I hate my forehead\u2019, and an article appeared about another lady who\u2019d had the same surgery at the clinic.\n\n\u201cIt was literally a lightbulb moment. I didn\u2019t even know hairline lowering surgery existed. There was no question whether I was having it. It was happening.\u201d\n\nShe had the surgery - which lasted around two hours and involved general anaesthetic - in August this year and her confidence was instantly boosted.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe scar is so well hidden and if you put makeup on it then you can\u2019t even see it.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier with the results.\u201d\n\n(Image: marco/richards)\n\nCarla\u2019s surgeon Christopher Inglefield says demand for hairline lowering ops have skyrocketed since he first began performing them in 2013.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to disguise this area of the body in everyday life.\n\n\u201cAnd another huge driver behind forehead unhappiness is that people assume, wrongly, that there\u2019s no remedy.\n\n\u201cWe often hear from patients who say, \u2018I never knew this surgery existed - and I\u2019m so relieved it does\u2019.\n\n\u201cAs in Carla\u2019s case, we hear stories of past bullying at school, the struggles to form meaningful relationships and the general erosion of any sort of self-esteem.\n\n\u201cWe first began performing hairline lowering surgery in 2013 and it\u2019s been increasing in popularity ever since.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also a popular procedure for trans patients, particularly male to female transitioning patients who are undergoing facial feminization surgery.\u201d\n\nFore more information about the clinic, click here , and for more information about Huda beauty, click here .", "description": "Carla-Marie Norton's choice of hairstyle, the Croydon Facelift ponytail, also caused her hair line to recede, making her forehead bigger", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Image", "Marco Richards"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20700112.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Carla-Marie-Norton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
