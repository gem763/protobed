Parliament's rejection of the deal forced then-Prime Minister Theresa May from office.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT'S THE NEW PLAN?\n\nJohnson's new proposal is that after Brexit, Northern Ireland would remain aligned with the EU's single market rules for trade in animal, food and manufactured goods.\n\nBut the province would leave the EU's customs union, along with the rest of Britain, so the country as a whole could strike new trade deals.\n\nThe proposal also says the legislative assembly in Northern Ireland would have the right to decide every four years whether it wants to continue to abide by EU rules on traded goods.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN?\n\nThe plan would effectively create two borders.\n\nFirst, there would be a regulatory border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Britain. Goods from mainland Britain would need to be checked to ensure they conform to EU standards, given Northern Ireland would be still be part of the European single market.\n\nIn addition, there would be a customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Checks would be needed to ensure duties and taxes were paid on goods moving from Northern Ireland to within the EU and to prevent smuggling.\n\nThe British proposal says there would be no physical infrastructure along the 500 km (300 mile) border.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT'S THE BORDER ISSUE?\n\nAccording to Irish and EU officials, there are several issues with the plan proposed by Johnson, who is determined for Britain to leave the EU on Oct. 31, with or without a deal.\n\nThey say there would inevitably have to be some form of border checks to preserve the integrity of the EU single market, and that would end frictionless trade on the island of Ireland.\n\n\"Any form of controls and checks in and around the border would signify the end of frictionless trade and as such would harm the all-island economy as well as represent a serious risk to the peace process,\" European Union lawmakers said in response to the UK plan.\n\nBritain has proposed only having physical checks on a very small proportion of traded goods at premises or designated locations anywhere in Ireland or Northern Ireland - to avoid having a physical hard border.\n\nThe arrangements would be supported by measures such as a trusted-trader scheme, simplified customs procedures, monitoring technology and exemptions for smaller business.\n\n\n\n\n\nWON'T THAT WORK?\n\nEU officials say the proposals wouldn't provide enough reassurance for Ireland and other EU members that their single market was protected against price dumping, unfair competition and smuggling at the border's roughly 270 crossing points.\n\nAnd if Ireland fails to check goods coming into the EU from Britain, it could raise questions as to whether Irish exports to the bloc should remain free of checks at their ports, even though it will remain in the customs union.\n\n\"It's hard to see the substance of the customs proposal working for the EU side. It creates regulatory friction with Britain and customs friction with the EU,\" said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe of the Eurasia Group.", "description": "Britain's latest proposal for an agreement on the terms of its divorce from the European Union has been widely rebuffed in Brussels because it does not meet the objectives of the so-called Irish border backstop.
