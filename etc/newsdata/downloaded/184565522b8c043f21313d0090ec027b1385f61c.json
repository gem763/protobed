Macron has reportedly been a holdout when it comes to all EU members agreeing on pushing the Brexit deadline beyond October 31, a topic that will be discussed in Brussels on Monday. Without an extension, the agreement reached between British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the EU will not be implemented, and the U.K. will leave the union in a so-called hard exit. Johnson has called for an early election, Dec. 12, in a bid to get his Brexit bill pushed through Parliament. A vote on that early election is expected on Monday, said the BBC.", "description": "A French government official said President Emmanuel Macron will back a three-month extension to the U.K.'s Brexit deadline, according a Bloomberg News...", "authors": ["Barbara Kollmeyer", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
