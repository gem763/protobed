But one of these may be right for you. (All prices below are for queen-size mattresses and may vary.)\n\nWhat a difference 2\u00bd inches makes: The fluffed-up Casper Essential ($600)\u2014now 11 inches thick\u2014went from being a dorm-room dud to being a mattress that impressed the majority of our testers in the around-$1,000-and-under memory-foam category. Added height gives mattresses an air of luxury, and although thicker mattresses aren\u2019t necessarily more durable, they may feel a bit sturdier for heavier folks who sense that a thinner version of the same mattress collapses too close to the ground when they lie on it. Twenty out of 35 testers called the Essential their top pick or runner-up among the four contenders, and it came in three votes ahead of the second-place Tulo. (The Leesa and the Casper signature mattresses, which cost almost twice as much, placed third and fourth, respectively.) Fans described the Essential as having a good blend of support and give, with a minimal \u201cquicksand\u201d feel\u2014which makes sense, given that its top, polyfoam layer tones down the inherent hugginess of the memory-foam layer just beneath it. The Essential comes off as a medium compared with the Tulo Comfort Medium\u2019s medium firm, and it features a zip-off spot-clean, upholstery-grade cover (which, unfortunately, makes the mattress look like a giant sofa cushion). Ultimately, we decided not to add the mattress to our roundup of picks because we still think the Tulo, at $100 less, offers more value (plus better edge support, and the option of Soft and Firm versions). But we do think the Essential is worth a try for budget-conscious side-sleepers who prefer a less firm and less huggy feel, or for those who have kids and pets. The model is too new to gauge user experience, but with its foam density of 3 pounds per cubic foot (typical in this price range), we think it will hold up better in the long term for people who weigh less than 200 pounds than for those who weigh more.\n\nThe Casper Wave (about $2,300) recently plumped up from 12 inches to 13, giving it a luxe silhouette that\u2019s better matched with its lofty list price. In our latest group survey, it edged past our current high-end-foam pick, the Loom & Leaf Relaxed Firm, by two votes. Both mattresses felt medium to medium soft to most of us, with nice pressure relief and support and decent stability around the edges. The difference is in the cushioning. The Wave has a soft, sponge-y (almost springy) sensation, perhaps because of its latex layer. Wave fans on staff called the result \u201cairy,\u201d but critics described it as \u201cballoon-y.\u201d The 12-inch-thick Loom & Leaf was more pillowy and conforming in its plushness. Loom & Leaf lovers liked the way it \u201ccradled\u201d them, while Team Wave said the sensation was reminiscent of a \u201cbean bag.\u201d Ultimately, we stuck with the Loom & Leaf as our pick because, at $1,500, it\u2019s more affordable, and it contains quality materials that the company details on its website. Nevertheless, if you have a flexible budget and a preference for a loose-foamy sleep surface, then it\u2019s worth visiting a Casper store and giving the Wave a try. The Wave\u2019s memory-foam layer, at 3\u00bd pounds per cubic foot, is less dense than the Loom & Leaf\u2019s (it has a 4\u00bd-pounds-per-cubic-foot layer and a 5-pounds-per-cubic-foot layer). Lower density typically suggests less long-term durability for sleepers who weigh more than 200 pounds. But the inherently durable latex layer added on top of it might make up for that. We\u2019ll keep our eye on user reviews and report about its longevity in the future. For about an additional $200, you can add springs and turn it into a hybrid. But, by far, our staff preferred the all-foam version\u2014the bounce from the coils made the Wave feel quite a bit softer and more jiggly.\n\nThe spiffed-up Casper original (about $1,000, but often on sale)\u2014now 12 inches instead of 10, with the option of added springs and edge support for about $200 more\u2014feels like a much nicer mattress than the one we tested in 2018. The new all-foam version is on the firm side of medium firm, and it offers a cradling sensation, as opposed to Tulo\u2019s slow sink. In our recent group test, the Casper Essential and the Tulo, both at roughly half the cost of the Casper original, won over more staffers in the mid-price foam-only category. Still, it\u2019s worth noting that the Casper has slightly denser, and therefore perhaps more durable, memory foam than others in its price category (3\u00bd pounds per cubic foot, as opposed to 3-ish). And its hybrid option has a unique sensation, with considerably more bounce and a bit more give than the Leesa Hybrid. It also has less motion isolation (which is to be expected from a mattress with more bounce) but decent edge support. However, the memory-foam density is still 3\u00bd pounds per cubic foot, compared with the 4 or 5 pounds per cubic foot in our two hybrid picks. And unlike the Wave\u2019s memory-foam layer, the Casper\u2019s has only a polyfoam layer on top of it\u2014no latex. So the mattress may not be ideal for those who weigh over 200 pounds. In addition, the company would tell us only that there were \u201cover 600\u201d individually pocketed coils, which leads us to suspect it\u2019s probably not close to 1,000 (approximately the count in our picks, the Tempur-Adapt and the Leesa Hybrid). Coil count isn\u2019t everything, but that\u2014along with the less-dense foam\u2014suggests that just because this mattress is less expensive than our hybrid picks, it\u2019s not necessarily a bargain. Nevertheless, if you are looking for noticeable bounce with your foam and aren\u2019t too concerned about motion transfer or the company\u2019s lack of transparency, the Casper with springs may be worth a try at one of Casper\u2019s many sleep stores across the country.\n\nThe all-foam Leesa (about $1,000, but often on sale) was our top pick for side- and stomach-sleepers in the first iteration of this guide, and we still like it\u2014although recently it hasn\u2019t wowed our group testers as much as other mattresses. The Leesa we tried in 2018 and 2019 is a different version from the one we originally tested, in 2016. What sets the new version of the Leesa apart is how its top doesn\u2019t mold around the body like most memory foam. As one of our testers said, \u201cI liked that it has the soft feel of foam, but it didn\u2019t let me sink too far in.\u201d We think the Leesa could be a good option for side-sleepers who want to spend no more than $1,000, especially if they prefer a loose cradling sensation and a plusher top, as opposed to the slow-sinking, body-contouring hug of many memory foams. But ultimately we concluded that the Leesa\u2019s price made it a middling choice. It\u2019s significantly more expensive than the Tulo, which has similar foam density (so it will likely last about as long), and we think the Tulo will please many people who are looking for a mid-price mattress. Plus, if you\u2019re willing to spend around $1,500, you can snag the much nicer Loom & Leaf or the Leesa Hybrid (on sale). If you\u2019re curious, though, you can try the Leesa, along with the Leesa Hybrid, in West Elm stores.\n\nOur testers really liked the Allswell Luxe Hybrid ($645), and it nearly became a pick. But the specs are disappointing\u2014the memory-foam layer is only 2 pounds per cubic foot, and the polyfoam is only 1.3 pounds per cubic foot. Nevertheless, many of our testers remarked that this model felt like a higher-end mattress. (\u201cThis does not feel like a cheap mattress,\u201d one tester noted.) In 2018, five people chose it as their top hybrid pick, and seven marked it as their runner-up\u2014putting the Allswell Luxe Hybrid in an impressive third place, behind the Leesa Hybrid and the Tempur-Adapt, but well ahead of other models that cost nearly twice as much. Fans appreciated not only the cushy top but also the overall support and springiness. Given this mattress\u2019 specs, we think it could be a reasonable short-term option or a good choice for a rarely used guest bedroom. The Allswell Luxe felt bouncier and plusher on top than the all-foam Zinus Green Tea, our other recommendation for a temporary fix. One staffer who likes his mattresses firm has slept on the Allswell Luxe for the past four months. \u201cIt distributes my weight well, and I like that it doesn\u2019t sink in,\u201d he noted. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m sleeping on top of it as opposed to in it,\u201d he said, adding that it\u2019s holding up well so far. We\u2019ll check in again in our next update.\n\nWe tried the Nest Alexander Signature Series ($1,300) in Medium in 2018, when it wasn\u2019t yet a flippable mattress. We noticed that it had great motion isolation and edge support, and the foam density also suggested good durability. Someone even mentioned that it looked like a \u201cluxury\u201d option. But at the end of the day, too many of us thought it was \u201ctoo soft.\u201d To me, it was a confusing sensation: The surface felt tight like a drum, and the softness came from beneath it. But now that it\u2019s flippable\u2014with medium on one side and firm on the other\u2014the Alexander may have wider appeal. You can decide for yourself in one of Nest\u2019s showrooms. If you find both sides equally appealing, you may want to flip the mattress on a regular basis to double its longevity.\n\nThe Original Purple ($1,000) features a foam called a \u201cbuckling column gel\u201d foam, which is what Purple\u2019s founders first used to create cushioned medical products. The company says its mattress is especially good at pressure relief, but our testers in 2018 couldn\u2019t get past the \u201cweird\u201d jiggly, crackly feeling we got when we lay on it. This was the most disliked mattress in the room on group-testing day, after the latex beds, but our testers didn\u2019t seem to like unusual textures in general. If you\u2019re open to new textures and have back or joint issues, the Purple may be worth trying; it\u2019s available at Mattress Firm stores nationwide. One staffer owns the Original, and although he\u2019s \u201cnot wowed\u201d by it, the mattress has held up for two years so far. A staffer with back pain tried the upgrade model, the All-New Purple ( $1,600 to $3,000), which has springs and options to add extra inches of the gel layer; he really liked it and is deciding whether it\u2019s worth the hefty price.\n\nThe Serta Perfect Sleeper Express ($900) beat out the Tulo by a hair in our 2018 group test as the all-foam mattress staffers liked the most, with 10 out of 23 people picking it as their favorite (versus Tulo\u2019s eight votes). As one tester explained, it had a \u201cnice sink and supportiveness.\u201d But we didn\u2019t make it a pick because this company was the least transparent about its mattress\u2019 materials (among those in the moderate price range). It also offers only a 45-day trial period. We noted that the Tulo had similar edge support and better motion isolation for (almost always) half the price.\n\nCostco\u2019s exclusive, 14-inch-thick Novaform Serafina Pearl Gel Memory Foam ($800) may be a good pick for back-sleepers or anyone who prefers a firmer mattress. It claims to sleep cool, though we haven\u2019t tried it yet. At its occasional sale price of $650, with free shipping and no extra fees for customers without a Costco membership, this mattress could be a good option if you live near a Costco and can try it out in the store or return it if you don\u2019t like it (under Costco\u2019s generous standard for \u201creasonable\u201d time). We haven\u2019t included this model in a group test because the returns seemed like a pain. But we\u2019ve since found that if you buy through Costco.com, the company will arrange to pick up the mattress if you don\u2019t like it. We plan to group-test it in the future to see how well it compares to our main picks.\n\nThe Cocoon by Sealy ($800) in Medium Soft earned top or runner-up all-foam votes from those testers who liked the softer side of medium firm. The soft version we tried was pleasingly plush, in my opinion, and its memory-foam density and edge support were similar to those of the Leesa. As with the Leesa, we didn\u2019t make it a pick because we found that you could experience a similar sensation with the Tulo, which is always on sale for $500. But if you like a softer memory-foam feel, this may be a better pick for you. Although you can\u2019t try it in a store, it has a 100-night trial period, within which you can return or exchange it, \u201cno questions asked.\u201d You\u2019re also allowed to return the second mattress if it still doesn\u2019t work for you, as long as you do so within the try-out window.\n\nThe rest\n\nThe Allswell ($345), that brand\u2019s entry-level offering, is one of the cheapest hybrid options around, but we concluded that it\u2019s worthwhile to upgrade to the Allswell Hybrid Luxe for an extra $300. The Allswell\u2019s specs are well below what we found in our picks. In my home tests, I felt myself sloping toward my husband because of our weight difference, but when I moved away from him, I started feeling as if I were rolling off the edge, despite the springs. Perhaps if we had a king-size mattress it wouldn\u2019t have made such a big difference, but I personally couldn\u2019t wait to move on to the next mattress.\n\nThe BedInABox PacBed Original ($680) comes from a company that has been in the online mattress biz since 2004, which is a pretty long time compared with the others. The memory-foam layer was as dense as that of the Tulo, and the polyfoam layer was even denser than in our picks. A staffer who slept in it said it felt too \u201chuggy\u201d and \u201cmuddy.\u201d\n\nThe Brooklyn Bedding Signature ($950) mattress is a nicely priced hybrid (spring and coils) that checks a lot of boxes, as it isolated motion well and felt supportive without being too firm. At 11 inches thick, it looked substantial, and the specs are serviceable. But like the Nest, it didn\u2019t make the initial cut with our testers because the overall feel was off-putting, perhaps because of its so-called TitanFlex layer, which is designed to have traits of both latex and foam but produced a \u201cbouncy yet sinky\u201d sensation very few of us liked. If that sounds good to you, though, you might give it a try; the company has multiple showrooms in Arizona as well as in select cities nationwide. We tried the medium model, but it also comes in soft and firm versions.\n\nThe GhostBed ($895), built with cooling in mind, is topped with a layer of latex (which is typically more breathable than memory foam), followed by a gel-infused memory foam. According to a Wirecutter staffer who slept on it, the combination worked, but he found the mattress extraordinarily firm, perhaps too much so for most people. However, given that latex tends to last longer, that the memory foam is a denser-than-usual 4 pounds, and that the mattress is exceptionally firm, the GhostBed may be worth a try for people who weigh more than 200 pounds. (The site recommends the Luxe version for those over 300 pounds.)\n\nOur testers didn\u2019t like the Helix Midnight ($895). One person who cast a vote for it as runner-up felt a plushness that would seem \u201cfun in a hotel though not every day.\u201d I personally liked the fluffiness-on-top feeling, but ultimately, given that the foam density is slightly less than the typically serviceable 3 pounds per cubic foot (in this case it\u2019s 2\u00bd), I\u2019m not sure how well the Midnight would last for people weighing closer to 200 pounds. Helix recently introduced the Nightfall, a hybrid with more coils and denser foam; we\u2019ll be testing this in the near future.\n\nAlthough the IKEA Matrand ($400) is a wallet-friendly memory-foam mattress, at 7\u215b inches, it\u2019s even thinner than the others we tried. That\u2019s probably why testers compared the mattress to \u201csleeping on the floor,\u201d even though its foam densities were similar to those of our picks.\n\nThe IKEA Mausund ($900) did not appeal to the vast majority of our testers, but then again, most of our testers didn\u2019t like latex in general\u2014our testers roundly dissed both latex mattresses we tried for feeling \u201ccheap\u201d and having \u201cweird texture.\u201d (Our pick of the two, the Sleep On Latex Pure Green, was merely less disliked; it\u2019s also arguably plusher and definitely less expensive.)\n\nThe Signature Sleep Contour 8 ($250) mattress is unbelievably cheap, and it has springs underneath the foam layer, too. It\u2019s a top seller on Amazon at this writing, but you get what you pay for: namely, a thickness of only 8 inches and the feeling of coils pressing against your body, especially if you sleep on your side.\n\nEve Sleep is a UK-based online mattress company that we included in our first guide.
