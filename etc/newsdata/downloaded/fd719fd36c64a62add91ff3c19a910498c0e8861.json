It\u2019s rare in today\u2019s world, but he\u2019s a person who runs away from the camera.\n\nDurham, who became the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut in 2018, has been tasked with \u201cexploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election,\u201d Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec said in a statement on Sept. 25.\n\nHis mandate, the Justice Department also said, is to determine whether \u201cintelligence collection activities by the U.S. government related to the Trump 2016 Presidential Campaign were lawful and appropriate.\u201d The investigation was launched in April.\n\nDurham has a \u201csmall team\u201d under him on this matter, according to a Justice Department official. But he also enjoys the direct support of the Trump administration.\n\nAttorney General William Barr has traveled extensively as part of the investigation to introduce Durham to foreign counterparts, including to officials in Italy and the United Kingdom. Barr has also enlisted Trump to call other foreign leaders about the matter.\n\nRead More: How Trump\u2019s Obsession With a Conspiracy Theory Led to the Impeachment Crisis\n\nBarr, who was appointed by Trump and has a strong view of executive power, has apparently taken a personal interest in Durham\u2019s investigation. But those who know Durham say it\u2019s not his style to get caught up in politics.\n\nDurham would never \u201cstart an investigation with anything other than an open mind,\u201d says Anthony Cardinale, a Boston lawyer who has known Durham for decades. \u201cParticularly I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the kind of person [who] if somebody said to him, for example, \u2018This is the result we want you to reach,\u2019 I don\u2019t he\u2019d take the job.\u201d\n\nBarr chose Durham for this role because of \u201chis credentials,\u201d says a Justice Department official. \u201cHe has a rock-solid reputation as an investigator.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t Durham\u2019s first time leading a high profile, sensitive investigation.\n\nIn 1999, then-Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Durham to investigate Boston police and FBI agents\u2019 connections to infamous mob boss James \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger and Stephen \u201cThe Rifleman\u201d Flemmi. Durham uncovered evidence of corrupt law enforcement officials who had been giving information to the gangsters, and helped convict one former FBI agent on federal racketeering charges.\n\nIn 2008, then-Attorney General Michael Mukasey appointed Durham to investigate the destruction of CIA video tapes of detainee interrogations. Then-Attorney General Eric Holder expanded Durham\u2019s mandate in 2009 to also investigate the legality of the CIA\u2019s enhanced interrogation techniques with detainees. Durham opened criminal investigations into the deaths of two detainees.\n\nDurham spent two years on the tapes investigation, closing it in 2010 without recommending any criminal charges. His final report remains classified. He closed the torture investigation in 2012, also without filing any criminal charges.\n\nDurham\u2019s broad investigation fits into a complicated constellation of people inside and outside the government looking into both allegations of surveillance of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and, separately but perhaps relatedly, whether Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election.\n\nJustice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz recently completed an internal review about the FBI application for a warrant for surveillance on Trump campaign aide Carter Page during the 2016 election. That report will be declassified and released imminently, according to a Justice Department official.\n\nA separate investigation by the U.S. Attorney in Utah, John Huber, which had been examining the FBI\u2019s surveillance of Page, and other FBI conduct, has been \u201csubsumed\u201d into Durham\u2019s, according to the Justice Department official.", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s fixation on the Mueller investigation and Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 election is filled with dubious characters, pitched Twitter spats and bombastic TV\u2026", "authors": ["Tessa Berenson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZINvW5AU2C6pPrkbW5DuYw--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MTU2MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/d2f497813346698c0177a47bf4bfa4a9", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
