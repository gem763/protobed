That\u2019s all I can do.\u201d\n\nCoach Jay Gruden said Derrius Guice was prepared to receive \u201cthe mother load\u201d of Washington\u2019s carries. Guice is making his NFL debut Sunday after missing his entire rookie season with a torn ACL.\n\nPeterson, now 34, was signed last year to take over Guice\u2019s spot after that injury, and he quickly became the featured back and finished the year with 1,042 rushing yards, eighth-most in the NFL.\n\nThe other Washington running backs likely to be active Sunday are Chris Thompson and former Eagle Wendell Smallwood, who can contribute on special teams, which Peterson doesn\u2019t do.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
