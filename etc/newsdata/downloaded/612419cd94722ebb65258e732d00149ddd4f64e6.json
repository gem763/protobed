They got a penalty and my goalkeeper was spat at and had missiles thrown at him.\n\n\u201cThe referee halted the game briefly, they scored the penalty, one of players went to pick the ball out of the back of the net and Coby Rowe was racially abused.\u201d\n\nLoizou said he had to take his players off.\n\n\u201cI looked at a couple of our players\u2019 faces and I was distraught myself, just to see their faces. I gave it a couple of minutes and I went on the pitch and pulled my players off,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere was no way that two or three of those players could have continued playing. What they heard was disgusting, they looked frightened.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t sit down and watch young players being abused by a minority.\u201d\n\nRowe later posted on Twitter: \u201cCan\u2019t believe I\u2019m tweeting this and it\u2019s 2019 but today I was a victim of racism, in what was supposed to be a great day for @HaringeyBoroFC. Another game of football ruined by racists.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Matter of urgency\u2019 \u2013\n\nAnti-discrimination charity Kick It Out praised the \u201cswift and decisive action\u201d taken by Loizou and his players.\n\nThe FA said it was looking into the incident \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d.\n\nIn a statement, Yeovil said: \u201cWe are aware that there are allegations that racist comments were made in the crowd and this allegation will be a key part of any investigation.\n\n\u201cIrrespective of the outcome of any investigations, we would like to make it clear that the club will not accept racism or discrimination in any form.\u201d\n\nEngland players endured monkey chants and apparent Nazi salutes in Bulgaria. That match was stopped twice as England players made their feelings known to UEFA officials before the tie was eventually completed.\n\nAston Villa\u2019s Tyrone Mings, who made his international debut that night and was singled out by the Bulgarian crowd, applauded Haringey for \u201ctaking a stance\u201d against racism.\n\n\u201cSometimes it can get brushed off in lower leagues but everyone stands with you,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cOur country isn\u2019t perfect either.\u201d", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 An FA Cup qualifying match between Haringey Borough and Yeovil Town was abandoned on Saturday after allegations that players were", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/ef2627_fa-cup-haringey-borough-yeovil-town-was-abandoned-allegations-players-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
