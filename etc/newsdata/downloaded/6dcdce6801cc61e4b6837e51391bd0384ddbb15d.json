Trump campaigns in Texas with fundraiser and rally as aides tout Syria ceasefire", "language": "en", "text": "As his war of words with Democrats heated up and a chorus of Republicans blamed him for a shooting war in Syria, Donald Trump surrounded himself Thursday with Texas fans and donors instead of persistent critics and sudden defectors.\n\nA White House aide said Thursday morning that there were 'traitors on our team' on Capitol Hill, and that the president would be happy to 'campaign, campaign, campaign.'\n\nAfter Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pence brokered a five-day ceasefire with Turkey and Trump boasted about it on an airport tarmac in Fort Worth, the aide texted: 'So much win. We can walk and chew gum at the same time.'\n\nOne hundred twenty-nine House Republicans had voted for a resolution on Wednesday condemning Trump for withdrawing U.S. troops from northern Syria, a move that gave Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan an open lane to attack that country's Kurdish minority.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had said Thursday that he hoped his chamber would vote on an even stronger measure, one that seemed needless after Trump told reporters about his unconventional move \u2013 essentially starting a shooting war in order to dramatically end it.\n\nPresident Donald Trump took a victory lap after landing in Texas on Thursday after VP Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brokered a five-day ceasefire with Turkey\n\nThe ceasefire, which Trump said he expects to last longer, gave him an opening to spend Thursday raising money and campaigning in and around Dallas; a White House aide said 'So much win! We can walk and chew gum at the same time.'\n\nThe president followed the developments aboard Air Force One during his campaign swing through fundraising events, a foctory opening ceremony, and a raucous rally in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.\n\nAfter landing in Forth Worth, he told DailyMail.com that he believes the five-day ceasefire Pence and Pompeo secured will be a more long-lasting one. And he said he expects Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan to visit the White House next month as scheduled.\n\nAn aide from Trump's 2016 campaign highlighted the fundraising potential, calling Texas 'America's biggest and most reliable ATM for Republican candidates.'\n\nCampaign organizers say more than 20,000 people are expected to fill American Airlines Center Thursday night, and another 10,000 might be left outside when the fire marshal closes the doors.\n\nA tailgate-style '45 Fest' outside the arena began at 10:30 a.m. with food trucks, live music and big-screen TV's showing campaign videos and snippets from Trump rally speeches.\n\n'We're going to have a big party out here,' said campaign deputy communications director Erin Perrine.\n\nThe president announced the Turkey deal while he was on Air Force One between Washington and Dallas\n\nMinutes after landing, the president met with supporters, signed autographs, and gloated to photographers when a women showed him a 'Women for Trump' banner\n\nThe first person in line to get into the rally, a man who flew in from Las Vegas, arrived at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday, the Dallas Morning News reported.\n\nBy midafternoon chants of 'Dallas loves Trump' and 'CNN Sucks' broke out among the faithful, according to people there.\n\nThursday's fundraising events point to Trump's strength among moneyed elites in north Texas. The most dominant pro-Trump super PAC collected more from Dallas-based donors in 2016 than from anywhere else.\n\nBut Dallas itself is overwhelmingly Democratic, and the surrounding counties are a political mess of purple with an open congressional seat up for grabs next year following the retirement of Rep. Kenny Marchant.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, a former Texas congressman, is hosting a competing 'rally against fear' that he claims will attract a huge bipartisan crowd.\n\nTurkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, shook hands with Vice President Mike Pence prior to their talks at the Presidential Palace in Ankara, Turkey, on Thursday\n\nThis picture taken Thursday from the Turkish side of the border with Syria shows smoke and fire rising from the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain during the Turkish offensive against Kurdish groups in northeastern Syria\n\nPeople set up tables along a road in Dallas a day before President Donald Trump arrived for his nighttime campaign rally\n\nDemocrats hope Texas could be in play as a battleground state in 2020 \u2013 an unlikely development after similar projections failed to produce a Texas blue wave in 2016.\n\nDemocrats haven't won a statewide political race of any kind in the Lone Star State since 1994. President Jimmy Carter was the last Democrat to win its 38 Electoral College votes, in 1976.\n\nBut Trump's 9-point victory over Hillary Clinton in Texas was the narrowest for a Republican presidential candidate in decades. And demographic changes in America's fastest-growing state are most pronounced among Hispanics who support Democrats more often than not.\n\nO'Rourke held a crosstown-rival rally in February when the president spoke in O'Rourke's native El Paso. He drew an audience nearly as large as Trump's, briefly putting his fledgling White House bid into a national conversation full of contrasts and bombast.\n\nLocal Democrats have promised a separate Anti-Trump rally outside American Airlines Center on Thursday before the president delivers his trademark stemwinder, steeped in bluster and drenched in exaggeration.\n\n'We're going to have a big crowd. Probably more than he has,' Dallas County Democratic chair Carol Donovan told the Morning News.\n\nThe president's day also includes a ribbon-cutting to open a Louis Vuitton workshop, whose launch is part of what the Trump campaign calls a hiring binge that has created 782,000 jobs since he took office.", "description": "'So much win.
