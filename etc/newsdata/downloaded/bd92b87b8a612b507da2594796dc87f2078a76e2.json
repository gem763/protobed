The shocker that consumed Twitter three hours ago is so quickly overwhelmed by the next one that it seems impossible to digest any single moment to assess its meaning or consequences.\n\n\u201cUnconventional\u201d was the word the president himself used repeatedly on Thursday.\n\nHe used it specifically to describe his let-them-go-to-war policy with respect to two American allies, Turkey and the Kurds, followed by a cease-fire days later. All part of the plan, he assured Americans. Just a little \u201ctough love\u201d to get the two sides to resolve their differences.\n\nNever mind that their differences are nowhere near solved, even as bodies are strewn in northern Syria, Kurds are forced out of their homes and Russia, Iran, Bashar al-Assad and even the Islamic State are celebrating.\n\n\u201cWe were a little bit unconventional,\u201d Mr. Trump explained, offering his foreign policy doctrine in a setting that was itself a little bit unconventional, a Louis Vuitton workshop near Keene, Texas, where they make Parisian bags while cattle graze outside. The president had stopped by in between a Fort Worth fund-raiser and his Dallas rally to cut the ribbon on the new factory as a favor to Bernard Arnault, the luxury industry giant, bringing French sensibility to the Lone Star State.\n\n\u201cLouis Vuitton \u2014 a name I know very well,\u201d Mr. Trump said to laughter, even as he mispronounced the name he knows well. \u201cIt cost me a lot of money over the years.\u201d\n\nFortunately for him, his Trump National Doral near Miami will soon have plenty of new business as the leaders of not just France but also Germany, Britain, Canada, Italy and Japan \u2014 and maybe Russia \u2014 will descend on the club next spring along with thousands of officials, diplomats, journalists and others who attend each year\u2019s G7 summit meeting.", "description": "If he acted \u201cpresidential,\u201d Mr. Trump said Thursday night in Dallas, \u201ceverybody would be out of here so fast.\u201d", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/18/us/politics/18dc-memo1/18dc-memo1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
