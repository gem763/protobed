No sibling, mum, dad...I feel like she\u2019s all alone. Cain & Moira have Isaac. Even though Cain is Cain I\u2019m seeing him in a different light. He\u2019s hurt, badly. Nate is hurting, all three are hurting for different reasons #Emmerdale.\"\n\nWhile another commented: \"I felt sorry 4 Moira so shoot me. She knows she's done wrong but the way she collapsed in Matty's arms showed she's broken & lashed out only way knew how. Sad 2 when Kyle ran to her & gave her a hug. Agreed w/Mandy that Cain shouldn't keep the kids frm seeing Moira #emmerdale.\"\n\nA third remarked: \"Emmerdale need to allow Moira time to build up her mental health. She\u2019s a strong women,but over the past 3 years they\u2019ve worn her to the ground. Made her unrecognisable! #emmerdale.\"\n\nMoira has suffered much tragedy in her life, with her former husband John Barton dying after his car fell off a ravine in February 2012 and daughter Holly tragically overdosing in September 2016.\n\nShe then began spiraling out of control, which included killing Emma by pushing her off the viaduct.\n\nSubsequently, her son Adam took the wrap and went on the run for police. Has Moira been struggling to deal with everything that has happened to her in her life? And could it all have devastating consequences?\n\n*Emmerdale airs tonight at 7pm on ITV", "description": "Moira Dingle's erratic behaviour, including her affair with Nate, with over the last few months has thoroughly confused fans", "authors": ["Rose Hill"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20744224.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_THP_CHP_281019SLUG_7205JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
