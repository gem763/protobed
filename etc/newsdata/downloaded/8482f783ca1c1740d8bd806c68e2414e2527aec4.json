REUTERS/Carlos Jasso\n\nFacebook said on Monday it would increase transparency through measures such as showing more information about the confirmed owner of a Facebook page and more prominently labeling content that independent fact-checkers have marked as false.\n\nThe social media giant has come under fire in recent weeks over its policy of exempting ads run by politicians from fact-checking, drawing ire from Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nLast week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended the policy, saying social media had introduced transformative avenues for speech that should not be shut down.\n\nThat same day, the Biden campaign called for the removal of an ad run by a super PAC campaign group, not a politician, that it said contained false claims about the former vice president.\n\nKatie Harbath, Facebook\u2019s head of global elections policy, said in response that if the now inactive ad ran again, it would be sent to Facebook\u2019s third-party fact-checkers.\n\nOn Monday, Facebook said would be putting into effect its planned ban on paid ads that tell people in the United States not to vote. Zuckerberg told reporters on a conference call that the ban on voter misinformation would also apply to ads run by politicians.\n\nThe company will start labeling state-controlled media on its page and in the site\u2019s ad library. In a blog post, Facebook said it planned to expand this labeling to specific posts on both Facebook and Instagram early next year.\n\nFacebook, Twitter and YouTube, the video-streaming service of Alphabet\u2019s Google, all recently came under scrutiny after showing ads from Chinese state-controlled media that criticized Hong Kong protesters.\n\nThis month, the Senate committee investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election said that the Kremlin\u2019s best-known propaganda arm increased its social media activity after that vote.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line here is that elections have changed significantly since 2016 and Facebook has changed too.\u201d Zuckerberg said on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe face increasingly sophisticated attacks from nation states like Russia, Iran and China, but I\u2019m confident we\u2019re more prepared.\u201d\n\nTheories that China has interfered in U.S. elections are absurd and laughable, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying at a regular press briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.\n\nIf someone says China interfered in the U.S. election, they should provide proof, said Hua. China has never had any interest in interfering with other countries\u2019 internal affairs, she said.\n\nMoscow and Tehran have also repeatedly denied the allegations.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A 3-D printed Facebook logo is seen in front of displayed binary code in this illustration picture, June 18, 2019. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\n\nFacebook will introduce a new U.S. presidential candidate spend tracker to show how much they have spent on political ads as part of the company\u2019s efforts to make its ad library easier to use, Zuckerberg said.\n\nFacebook launched an online library of political ads in 2018, but the database has been criticized by researchers as being poorly maintained and failing to provide useful ad targeting information.\n\nThe company plans to heighten protection of the Facebook and Instagram accounts of candidates, elected officials and their teams through a program called Facebook Protect. Participants in the program will be required to turn on two-factor authentication and their accounts will be monitored for signs of hacking.", "description": "Facebook has announced steps to combat misinformation and voter suppression ahead of the November 2020 U.S. presidential election, on the same day it disclosed the removal of a network of Russian accounts targeting U.S. voters on Instagram.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Culliford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443467534&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K1NM", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
