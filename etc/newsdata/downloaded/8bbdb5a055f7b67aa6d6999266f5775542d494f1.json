There they found extreme political manipulation of the lines similar to what voters suing over the congressional map also say occurred.\n\nIn the ruling Monday, the judges \u2014 Paul Ridgeway, Alma Hinton and Joseph Crosswhite \u2014 agreed that \u201cthere is a substantial likelihood that plaintiffs will prevail on the merits of this action by showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the 2016 congressional districts are extreme partisan gerrymanders\u201d in violation of the North Carolina Constitution.\n\nThe judges gave no date by which a new map must be drawn, but suggested lawmakers could redraw them on their own quickly to ensure congressional primaries be held as scheduled. The State Board of Elections has said lines needed to be finalized by Dec. 15.\n\n\u201cThe court respectfully urges the General Assembly to adopt an expeditious process,\u201d the judges wrote.\n\nRepublican state legislators made plain when they drew that map that the lines were designed to help the GOP retain 10 of the state\u2019s 13 congressional seats, but argued such strategies weren\u2019t unlawful. Republican defendants in the lawsuit and three sitting GOP U.S. House members opposed the injunction request.\n\nThe judges\u2019 ruling, which could be appealed, would likely lead to a map with more competitive districts for the November race \u2014 making it more difficult for national Republicans to retake control of the U.S. House. The lawsuit is being bankrolled by a national Democratic group led by former Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nDemocratic and unaffiliated voters who sued Sept. 27 sought the injunction before any trial is held on their partisan gerrymandering claims. They said the case was extremely similar to a successful lawsuit over state legislative districts.\n\nThe same three judges hearing the congressional case ruled in that case just two months ago, finding Republicans performed extreme political manipulation in those maps to ensure they could hold majorities in almost any political environment. Republicans were ordered to redraw those lines. Also Monday, the judges issued a separate ruling in the legislative case, upholding all of the changes that the General Assembly made to several dozen state House and Senate districts. The plaintiffs who sued there had wanted a third-party expert to step in and rework 19 House districts.\n\nIn the current congressional lawsuit, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys convinced the judges that evidence already accumulated from separate federal litigation challenging the congressional lines shows they are likely to succeed in the state case.\n\nThe federal case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which decided 5-4 in June that federal courts would not get involved in partisan redistricting claims. But the justices left the door open for state courts to intervene.\n\nOpponents of the current congressional map have latched on to the comment made by state Rep. David Lewis during the 2016 remapping. Lewis said at the time he was proposing a 10-3 map \u201cbecause I do not believe it\u2019s possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats.\u201d Lewis said later he was joking.\n\nAttorneys for Lewis and other Republican lawmakers who are defendants in the state congressional lawsuit case reject the plaintiffs\u2019 partisan gerrymandering claims. They told the judges it was too late to make congressional map changes, since candidate filing begins in early December and that facts in the case were not settled. Changes now, the GOP\u2019s lawyers said, would result in voter confusion and extremely low turnout should the primary have to be delayed.", "description": "North Carolina judges on Monday blocked the state\u2019s congressional map from being used in the 2020 elections, ruling that voters had a strong likelihood of...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU172_ncmap1_ZG_20191028184437.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
