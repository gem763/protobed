(AP) - The Jacksonville Jaguars want to be a physical, smash-mouth team that has enough versatility to play other styles when needed.\n\nCoach Doug Marrone has seen snippets of it on both sides of the ball.\n\nHe\u2019s still waiting to see it on a consistent basis.\n\nThe Jaguars (2-2) would no doubt like to repeat their offensive performance from Sunday\u2019s 26-24 victory at winless Denver. Leonard Fournette ran 29 times for a career-high 225 yards, and rookie Gardner Minshew II directed a game-winning drive in the final minutes.\n\nBut the defense got burned repeatedly by Joe Flacco and failed to get a much-needed stop in crunch time.\n\nSo it wasn\u2019t the identity Marrone wants from his team, but it was a step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to come out and say we\u2019re a running team or we can stop the run and defend the pass, or we can get after the quarterback,\u201d Marrone said Monday. \u201cYou see a lot of glimpses of things in the past couple of games. In order to have an identity, you have to be consistent.\n\n\u201cReally, the one thing we\u2019ve been consistent with is being resilient and being able to work and play together. Right now, that\u2019s the identity of this team and we\u2019ll keep working on the other factors at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nThe Jaguars have dealt with issue after issue this season, beginning with linebacker Telvin Smith abandoning the team in May. Since then, there was defensive end Yannick Ngakoue\u2019s holdout, quarterback Nick Foles\u2019 shoulder injury and cornerback Jalen Ramsey\u2019s trade request.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a team that\u2019s been through a lot,\u201d Marrone said. \u201cA team that showed some resiliency, that\u2019s really blocked a lot of things out and really focused on what we asked them to do, a team that\u2019s playing together. There\u2019s a confidence about the phases being able to contribute to help each other out. If one\u2019s down, the other one can step up. I think that\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also given Jacksonville consecutive wins for the first time in more than a year.\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nMinshew has given the Jags chances to win each of their last three games.\n\nHe struggled at times against Denver, but his 7-yard touchdown pass to Ryquell Armstead in the third quarter was close to magnificent. Minshew sidestepped three defenders before finding Armstead in the back of the end zone.\n\nMinshew completed 19 of 33 passes for 213 yards and two TDs. He was sacked five times, but got to meet Peyton Manning afterward.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nJacksonville\u2019s defense has been hit and miss. The unit was stout against Houston and Tennessee, but was dismal in the opener against Kansas City and way too porous versus the Broncos.\n\nRamsey\u2019s return would help. But there\u2019s no guarantee the disgruntled defender, who\u2019s now dealing with apparent back tightness, will be healthy enough to practice this week or play at Carolina (2-2). Second-year pro Tre Herndon started in place of Ramsey and was picked on by Flacco.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nJacksonville\u2019s offensive line played its best game in two years. Marrone ripped the unit last week, and it responded with a dominant ground game in Denver. The group still has to cut down its penalties after getting flagged seven times against the Broncos.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nLeft tackle Cam Robinson was penalized three times - twice for false starts - and could have cost Jacksonville the game in the closing seconds for trying to fight with Denver defenders. CBS cameras later caught coaches separating Robinson and Fournette on the sideline after the game.\n\nINJURED\n\nSafety Ronnie Harrison left the game with a leg injury but later returned and should be good to go this week.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n51 - the number of consecutive games Ramsey started before being inactive for the first time in four seasons.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nFind a way to at least partially repair Ramsey\u2019s fractured relationship with the front office, specifically personnel chief Tom Coughlin.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Jacksonville Jaguars want to be a physical, smash-mouth team that has enough versatility to play other styles when needed.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Long"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/jaguars_broncos_football_07841_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
