It\u2019s must-see TV right there,\u201d Houston shortstop Carlos Correa said.\n\nJose Altuve, George Springer and a dominant rotation helped Houston lead the majors with a franchise-record 107 wins. Gleyber Torres, Aaron Judge and a strong bullpen sent New York toward 103 victories.\n\nGreinke pitches the opener, to be followed by Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole as the Astros lined up their aces on regular rest. Masahiro Tanaka starts Game 1 for the Yankees, with James Paxton and Luis Severino up next.\n\nHOMETOWN KID\n\nWashington ace Max Scherzer starts Game 2 of the NL Championship Series in his hometown of St. Louis. Scherzer also played college ball at the University of Missouri, but he had no interest in reliving old times.\n\n\u201cYeah, grew up here, but at this point in time really doesn\u2019t mean anything because I got a bigger task at hand and that\u2019s to go out here and win it for the Nats,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cSo that\u2019s where my mind\u2019s at.\u201d\n\nScherzer was terrific in the Division Series against the Dodgers, striking out 10 while pitching eight innings of one-run ball. Adam Wainwright pitches for the Cardinals in his first game since he threw 7 2/3 scoreless innings in Game 3 of the NLDS against Atlanta.\n\nOH BABY!\n\nThe Nationals will see whether reliever Daniel Hudson is back on the roster for Game 2. He was put on the postseason paternity list before the NLCS opener - Hudson and his wife welcomed a baby girl Friday. Washington manager Dave Martinez said everyone is healthy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to try to get back here possibly tomorrow,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cBut for me, I told him, I said, \u2018Hey, family is always first.\u2019 I get it. I understand. The timing didn\u2019t work out like we thought. Baby wasn\u2019t ready to come out, so we get him back when we get him back.\u201d\n\nRight-hander Wander Suero was on Washington\u2019s active roster against St. Louis until Hudson returns. Hudson has two saves and a win during the playoffs.\n\nHudson\u2019s absence weakens a shaky Washington bullpen that had the worst ERA in the National League at 5.66.\n\nJUST CHILLIN\u2019\n\nIt should be a bit warmer at Busch Stadium for Game 2 after overnight freeze warnings and frost advisories were posted in the St. Louis area. Many of the Nationals and Cardinals warmed up in hooded sweatshirts before the opener Friday night - temperatures were expected to drop into the low 40s by the last out. The forecast called for highs near 60 at the start of the second game.\n\nFor both teams, it was a quick switch from summer to fall. The Cards wrapped up their NL Division Series this week in Atlanta, where it was in the mid-90s. The Nationals came from their NLDS win at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at what's happening around the majors Saturday:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/alds_yankees_astros_baseball_93388_c0-156-3746-2341_s1200x700.jpg?0483b695e3b3e1864c3106eeeef9e71391eb9c1c", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
