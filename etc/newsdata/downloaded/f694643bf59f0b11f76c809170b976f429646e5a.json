(Alex Edelman/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump announced new sanctions Friday on Iran\u2019s central bank, calling them \u201cthe highest sanctions ever imposed on a country.\u201d\n\nIran, Trump said, \u201cis going to hell\u201d and is \u201cpractically broke.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks to me like they want to keep going at it. . . . And when they go at it with us, there\u2019s no way they win,\u201d he said, a day after Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said that any military strike against his country would bring \u201call-out war.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, the National Development Fund, was also sanctioned. U.S. officials charge that the multibillion-dollar fund is used to fund military and terrorist operations.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who joined Trump at an Oval Office meeting with the visiting prime minister of Australia, said that \u201cwe\u2019ve now cut off all source of funds to Iran.\u201d\n\nTrump promised the new sanctions earlier this week after cruise missiles and drone strikes against Saudi oil facilities that both the United States and Saudi Arabia have charged came from Iran. They follow a series of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d measures including a ban on Iranian oil exports.\n\nTrump is scheduled to meet later Friday with his national security team to discuss additional options to respond to Iran.\n\n\u201cGoing into Iran would be a very easy decision,\u201d Trump said at a press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison after their Oval Office session. \u201cMost people thought I would go in within two seconds,\u201d he said, referring to a U.S. military strike. \u201cBut plenty of time, plenty of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m showing great restraint. A lot of people respect it, some people don\u2019t,\u201d he said, referring to advice he\u2019s received about a possible U.S. military strike. \u201cI don\u2019t do it for anybody. I do it for the United States, what\u2019s good for our allies. And it\u2019s working out very well.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury Department charged that the Central Bank of Iran, whose directors were sanctioned last year, provides funding directly to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, itself designated as a terrorist organization for its support of proxy militias in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and elsewhere.\n\nOther governments are now \u201con notice that they are risking the integrity of their financial systems by continuing to work with the Iranian regime\u2019s arm of terror finance, its Central Bank,\u201d Sigal Mandelker, the top Treasury official on terrorism finance, said in a statement.\n\nThe central bank was first sanctioned by Congress in 2011, but those restrictions were lifted by the Obama administration under the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. Trump reimposed them, and the new measures, under executive order, add an additional layer.\n\nSanctions on the National Development Fund, however, are a first.", "description": "Announcement comes after president vowed new punishments following strikes against Saudi oil facilities.", "authors": ["Karen Deyoung", "Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent", "September At Pm", "Karen Deyoung Is Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent For The Post.
