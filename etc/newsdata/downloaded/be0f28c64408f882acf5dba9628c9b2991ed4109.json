Hoping for the same luck with Week 8! USA TODAY\n\nIn a matter of a few weeks, the NFL's MVP race opened back up again.\n\nReigning winner Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes looked to have a solid lead on the field through the first four weeks of the season. But then Mahomes was hobbled by an ankle injury and later waylaid by a dislocated knee ailment. In that time, quarterbacks Aaron Rodgers (Green Bay Packers), Russell Wilson (Seattle Seahawks) and Lamar Jackson (Baltimore Ravens) all bolstered their cases for the award while pushing their teams to the division lead. Carolina Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey, meanwhile, is leading the charge among players who aren't signal-callers.\n\nIn light of the reshuffled picture, we asked writers and editors from USA TODAY Sports and the USA TODAY Network: Which NFL player is the front-runner to be the 2019 MVP?\n\nTheir answers:\n\nI had been waffling on this a bit until this weekend. While I think Russell Wilson has been terrific, I didn\u2019t think he looked particularly good against the Ravens and that pick-six to Marcus Peters was a doozy. Which solidifies me on Christian McCaffrey. In addition to his numbers being terrific \u2013 second in the NFL in yards rushing per game and third in total yards rushing \u2013 he has largely been responsible for keeping the Carolina Panthers afloat without Cam Newton.\n\nYes, Kyle Allen has been impressive in backup duty. But McCaffrey has accounted for half of Carolina\u2019s touchdowns \u2013 nine of 18 \u2013 and more than 43 percent of the Panthers\u2019 offensive yardage. In addition to his 618 yards rushing, he\u2019s caught 35 passes for 305 yards and two touchdowns. He\u2019s been an incredible security blanket with so much uncertainty at quarterback.\n\nThe definition of MVP has been the subject of wide debate over the years. But it\u2019s hard to argue that anyone has been more valuable, more indispensable through the first seven weeks of the season than McCaffrey.\n\nRussell Wilson? In the spirit of the game show that provides a \u201clife line,\u201d at some point we\u2019ve got to be able to answer a question with a question. A week ago, the Seahawks quarterback was such an apparent front runner that Las Vegas bookies and well-meaning-but-often-misled sportswriters trumpeted this status. Now, not so sure. The NFL is so fickle, man. Lamar Jackson\u2019s takeover victory at Seattle not only gave him a W but seemingly pushed him past Wilson in the Who Wants to be MVP race. Jackson\u2019s multi-tasking wonderment \u2014 100-yard rushing days on top of the dynamic passing prowess that Bill Polian didn\u2019t see coming \u2014 has given Baltimore the exciting edge that bucks conventional NFL wisdom and looks like a sure bet to win the A-North crown. And just think: Jackson was Ozzie Newsome\u2019s parting first-round pick, like here\u2019s a nod to the future of the NFL game. In any event, this current MVP matter could use a Wizard of Oz to help as it likely will take many weeks to sort out. What about Aaron Rodgers? Yeah, maybe him, too. Or maybe Wilson reestablishes himself after his one bad game. It\u2019s just that straight questions are easier to provide at this point than straight answers. Is there a 50/50 option? Or it about time to poll the audience?\n\nYou\u2019re telling me Aaron Rodgers\u2014he of two MVP awards, a Super Bowl title and seven Pro Bowl berths\u2014was more perfect last Sunday than he\u2019s ever been? At least by one metric, passer rating, Rodgers was. Rodgers posted his first perfect passer rating in 172 career games as he accounted for six total touchdowns to equal the six of his 31 passes didn\u2019t reach their intended target. The Saints, 49ers and Patriots are all top teams in the NFL right now. But I believe stars on offense and defense more evenly fuel those contenders\u2019 success than fuel that of Green Bay. The Packers roster fields talented players like pass rushers Preston and Za\u2019Darius Smith. First-year coach Matt LaFleur has schemed well. But Rodgers consistently elevates his teammates and doesn\u2019t blink when stars like receiver Davante Davis (turf toe) miss a slew of games. Patrick Mahomes has been electric when healthy, but his ankle and knee injuries only strengthen Rodgers\u2019 case.\n\nI could give the nod to Aaron Rodgers or Russell Wilson, because both are playing fantastic ball and leading their teams to strong starts. But my pick is Lamar Jackson. He\u2019s literally putting the Ravens on his back and carrying them to victory. We\u2019ve seen him make significant strides in the passing game, but he continues to dazzle with his legs. He\u2019s currently the sixth-leading rusher in the NFL, and he has a passer rating of 94.1, which is better than notable guys like Carson Wentz, Philip Rivers, Jimmy Garoppolo, Jared Goff. The Ravens are going to win their division and they could be a playoff nightmare matchup nightmare for a lot of teams, just because Lamar Jackson is so dynamic a weapon. So, you\u2019ve gotta go with him.\n\nI'll go with Aaron Rodgers here, though it's a really tight race in my mind between him, Russell Wilson and Lamar Jackson. Rodgers gets the nod for me largely because of his upside in this offense. I think last week's performance against Oakland (25-of-31 for 429 yards and 5 touchdowns) is indicative of a growing comfort level with coach Matt LaFleur -- and possibly the start of string of huge performances in the coming weeks and months. (Getting Davante Adams back will obviously help, too.) With that said, I see the MVP race being a week-to-week deal, so don't count out the rest of the field -- especially someone like Jackson, who's proven capable of putting up massive numbers and has the Ravens playing like serious contenders in the AFC.\n\nThis, I think, is one of the hardest questions to answer right now. Some days, I\u2019m convinced it has to be Lamar Jackson. But now Aaron Rodgers has snuck into the conversation. Other days, I think Dak Prescott deserves some love. But what about Deshaun Watson? Christian McCaffrey, even? Oh, and I certainly didn\u2019t forget about Patrick Mahomes or Russell Wilson, either. And right now, I\u2019m giving the edge to Wilson. But it\u2019s a very slight edge. Jackson is probably in second, with Prescott trailing right behind them.\n\nI just think Wilson\u2019s efficiency, with a 15:1 TD-to-interception ratio, is what sets him apart. Through Week 7's games, he was just 0.3 behind Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins for the NFL lead in QB rating with a mark of 114.1. But Wilson is working with a roster that isn\u2019t nearly as loaded with star talent at the skill positions and has often needed to take the team\u2019s success upon his shoulders. In a third-quarter drive against the Browns two weeks ago, Wilson\u2019s headset with offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer went out, so he had to call the plays. The Seahawks scored a touchdown on that drive. He also ranks seventh in the league in completion rate (68.3%), ninth in yards (1,945) and is tied for first in passing touchdowns (15). I also get that the direct counterargument to picking Wilson is that Jackson just beat Wilson\u2019s team in Seattle, largely by taking over the game. Again, it\u2019s a very slight edge. Ask me tomorrow. I may change my mind.\n\nDespite the Seahawks\u2019 tough loss Sunday, Russell Wilson remains the MVP front-runner. He\u2019s carried Seattle to a 5-2 start and has thrown just one interception vs. a league-leading 15 touchdowns. Factor in what he does with his legs, and he\u2019s been the best player in the NFL this season.\n\nAaron Rodgers. This isn't exactly groundbreaking news, but Rodgers is still great, and he's the main reason why the Packers are rolling at 6-1 even though this is not a team that has elite weapons around their future Hall of Fame quarterback.\n\nAfter a slow start in Green Bay's new offense under new coach Matt LaFleur, Rodgers seems to be hitting his stride, and with 13 TDs against 2 interceptions and an adjusted completion percentage of 77.3, he's playing at an elite level. It seems like the more comfortable he gets, the better he's going to play this year, especially when he gets WR Davante Adams back.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' NFL coverage on Twitter @usatodaynfl.", "description": "What once looked like a clear-cut race now has several contenders, with Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson and Lamar Jackson all vying for MVP honors.", "authors": ["Usa Today Sports", "Published A.M.
