Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nIf the president thinks he had a bad day this week, he should see the Friday that his allies at the NRA experienced, when Democratic Senator Ron Wyden revealed an 18-month investigation by the Senate Finance Committee determining that the National Rifle Association served as a \u201cforeign asset\u201d for Russia in the run-up to the 2016 election.\n\nIt\u2019s been public knowledge that the gun-rights advocacy group had connections with two Russian assets, former Moscow official Alexander Torshin and Maria Butina \u2014 who is currently serving a sentence for conspiracy to act as a foreign agent for her efforts to infiltrate the NRA and the National Prayer Breakfast in order to influence conservative policy. But the Senate investigation displays a damning level of executive-suite involvement, including a 2015 trip from former NRA vice-president Pete Brownell, who visited Russia \u201cprimarily or solely for the purpose of advancing personal business interests, rather than advancing the NRA\u2019s tax-exempt purpose.\u201d\n\nNot only was Brownell \u2014 who later became the organization\u2019s president \u2014 spending NRA funds for personal business, an email from Maria Butina to two senior NRA staffers reveals that he was in Russia because \u201cmany powerful figures in the Kremlin are counting on Torshin to prove his American connections.\u201d The Senate investigation also found evidence of the NRA attempting to obscure house payments for the trip.\n\nThough he\u2019s currently embroiled in his own monumental scandal of foreign influence, on some level, Trump must be aware of the NRA\u2019s no-good, very-bad-day: He helped make is worse after all. On Friday, the New York Times reported that NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre met with Trump at the White House, asking the president if he could \u201cstop the games\u201d on gun control. According to the Times, the pair \u201cdiscussed prospective gun legislation and whether the N.R.A. could provide support for the president as he faces impeachment and a more difficult re-election campaign,\u201d which sounds similar to the quid-pro-quo exchange in Ukraine that got him into the mess of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nWhat separates this Senate investigation from other concerns the NRA is facing \u2014 allegations of lavish executive spending as the organization deals with substantial cash-flow problems; multiple crises in leadership \u2014 is that it could affect its status as a non-profit. \u201cThis was an official trip undertaken so NRA insiders could get rich \u2014 a clear violation of the principle that tax-exempt resources should not be used for personal benefit,\u201d Senator Wyden told CNN.\n\nAlready the organization\u2019s non-profit status is in jeopardy in New York, where Attorney General Letitia James is investigating if the NRA mis-used funds meant for charity purposes. And according to Marc Owens \u2014 the former head of the Internal Revenue Service division overseeing tax-exempt enterprises \u2014 the NRA is unlikely to exist without its non-profit status. \u201cThere is a tremendous range of what appears to be the misuse of assets for the benefit of certain vendors and people in control.\u201d Owens told the New Yorker in April, months prior to the Senate investigation proving such mismanagement of funds.", "description": "A Senate investigation led by Democrat Ron Wyden found that the NRA served as a \u201cforeign asset\u201d to Russia in the run-up to 2016 could place its tax-exempt status in jeopardy.
