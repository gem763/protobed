You could be getting a 16% return on your money right now, and it\u2019s not that hard to do.\n\nAs Mark Cuban, the \u201cShark Tank\u201d star, billionaire entrepreneur, and NBA franchise owner explains, just pay off your debts.\n\nAmericans carry an enormous amount of personal debt. The personal finance site NerdWallet put our revolving credit card balance at $420.22 billion in late 2018.\n\nThat\u2019s not considering total credit card debt, which is $944 billion, or the multiple trillions in mortgage, auto and student loan debt. The revolving number is just the credit card debt we carry from month to month.\n\nIt works out to $6,929 per U.S. household. Meanwhile, according to Credit Karma, the average rate on that debt was 15.96%.\n\nPay that off and you stop losing nearly 16% in compounding negative returns.\n\n\u201cThe reason for that is whatever interest you have \u2014 it might be a student loan with a 7% interest rate \u2014 if you pay off that loan, you\u2019re making 7%,\u201d Cuban said.\n\n\u201cAnd so that\u2019s your immediate return, which is a lot safer than trying to pick a stock, or trying to pick real estate or whatever it may be.\u201d\n\nJuicy returns\n\nDo you think you can find a stock that will return 16% in the next year? Do you think your retirement portfolio will grow that quickly?\n\nOf course not. Whatever short-run investment you make that promises juicy returns forces you to run the risk of equally powerful losses.\n\nLong-term investments are safer, but there you have to contend with what academics call \u201creversion to the mean,\u201d the tendency for investments to average out over the years.\n\nStocks from 1950 to 2018 returned 11.1% annually. Bonds returned 5.8%. If you had a 50/50 stock and bond portfolio, you averaged 8.8%.\n\nHow\u2019s that 16% looking now?\n\nLook, it\u2019s hard to pay off debts. Being debt-free (or at least credit-card debt free) requires immediate sacrifice.\n\nThat\u2019s vacations not taken. Car repairs delayed. Cooking at home and not relaxing in a restaurant on the weekend or for workday lunches.\n\nYet the cost of not paying off your high-interest debts is astronomical.\n\nLet\u2019s say you have exactly the typical American household credit balance of $6,929 and carry it for 20 years at 16%. You end up paying $135,038.\n\nNow let\u2019s say you invested that amount instead and earned 8.8% over 20 years. You end up with $37,486.\n\nYou should invest, the earlier the better. But, truthfully, the math strongly advises that you pay off any high-interest debt you carry as soon as humanly possible.\n\nA positive force\n\nThe power of compounding returns can be a positive force in your financial life. Even if you\u2019re starting late and retirement is only a decade off, starting is the key.\n\nMost people underestimate how long they might live. They spend today like there is no tomorrow. If they invest at all, they make short-run bets rather than taking the safer, more compelling long-term investment.\n\nAnd, too often, we discount the value of mathematically sound financial planning.\n\nThere are many unknowns about the stock market, the economy, politics and world events. Mostly, though, stocks go up regardless of the headlines.\n\nMeanwhile, the things we can estimate well \u2014 our personal indebtedness, housing costs, health expenses, Social Security and the cost of living \u2014 we tend to ignore.\n\nA better retirement plan process takes into account all of the knowns and compares them to likely long-term investment scenarios. By working with a qualified financial planning professional, you can settle your mind about retirement after just a few consultations.\n\nAnd, yes, paying down debt will be part of that plan. As Cuban argues, the best way to get ahead is to make sure you\u2019re not falling behind thanks to high-cost debt.", "description": "Better than picking a stock.", "authors": ["Mitch Tuchman"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HE188_cuban__ZG_20190219225226.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-20"}
