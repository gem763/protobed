If that happens, the U.K. will leave the EU on the first day of the month following the ratification.\n\nSpeaking anonymously because details of the decision have yet to be made public, one diplomat added that the Brexit withdrawal agreement can\u2019t be renegotiated during the extension period.\n\nJohnson did not immediately comment on Tusk\u2019s announcement, but under a law passed by British parliamentarians that forced him to request the extension that he did not want, Johnson must notify Tusk that Britain agrees to the proposed delay.\n\nJohnson had previously said he would \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than agree to extend Brexit beyond Oct. 31. He has been hammering his \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d mantra since he replaced Theresa May this summer, and his apparent willingness to consider leaving the bloc without a Brexit deal has spooked many British lawmakers.\n\nEconomists say a no-deal Brexit would hurt the economies of both Britain and the EU.\n\nTusk\u2019s announcement came after the EU diplomats met to sign off on the Brexit new delay. Leaving the envoys, EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told reporters \u201cit was a very short and efficient and constructive meeting and I am happy the decision has been taken.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the second time the Brexit deadline has been changed since British voters in 2016 referendum decided to leave the bloc.\n\nIn London later Monday, British politicians are to vote on whether to hold an early election to try to break the country\u2019s deadlock over Brexit. Johnson wants a Dec. 12 election, but looks unlikely to get the required support from two-thirds of lawmakers.\n\nIn a tactical chess move, two opposition parties \u2014 the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party \u2014 plan to push for a Dec. 9 election if Johnson\u2019s proposal fails.\n\nThe ruling Conservatives desperately want a new election to bolster their numbers in Parliament, but they face resistance from the main opposition Labour Party, which fears the country will be unwittingly tricked into crashing out of the EU without a deal.\n\nThe Dec. 9 election proposal is an effort to force Johnson to delay debate in Parliament on his Brexit withdrawal bill until after any election, depriving him of a possible victory on his trademark issue. It makes Johnson\u2019s government choose between holding an election to improve its position in Parliament and its goal of securing Brexit before that election takes place.\n\nFrance was initially reluctant to extend the Brexit deadline beyond its scheduled date of Oct. 31, but French European Affairs minister Amelie de Montchalin said the perspective of a new election in Britain justifies a new delay.\n\nShe said the important thing now is that \u201cthe British and the Europeans understand that, if there are some more weeks or months, it\u2019s not to postpone difficult decisions but to put ourselves in a position to clarify the situation.\u201d\n\nMontchalin also suggested that Britain can still backpedal on its decision to leave the bloc and revoke Article 50, meaning the U.K. would remain in the EU and cancel Brexit.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister can pick up his phone and call Brussels to say: I stop everything,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nLorne Cook in Brussels and Danica Kirka in London contributed to this report.", "description": "BRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 The European Union agreed Monday to delay Brexit until Jan. 31 next year \u2014 just three days before Britain was due to become the first", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/28/cee011_britain-eu-brexit-87057-britain-prime-minister-boris-johnson-reacts-he-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
