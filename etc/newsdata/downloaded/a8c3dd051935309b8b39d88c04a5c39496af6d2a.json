But today with this launch, we signal that we want to be a champion for great reporting.\u201d\n\nThe launch will initially include about 200 news organizations, including The Washington Post, The New York Times, News Corp. , BuzzFeed News, Business Insider, Bloomberg, Fox News, NBCUniversal, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times. Some of those outlets will be paid for their content, including The Post.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are always looking for innovative ways to bring smart, objective journalism to the forefront,\u201d said M. Scott Havens, Bloomberg Media\u2019s global head of digital and media distribution. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to be included in Facebook News and strongly value the product\u2019s approach to editorial curation of high quality content as a way to reach more readers on their platform.\u201d\n\nEileen Murphy, senior vice president of communications at The New York Times said \"Facebook News should make quality news easier to find in the Facebook environment and easier to distinguish from other forms of content. Our participation in this new tab will promote Times journalism to Facebook\u2019s audience while continuing to direct users to our own destinations, support our digital subscription growth strategy and increase our ability to invest in our newsroom.\u201d\n\nOn Friday morning, Jonah Peretti, co-founder and chief executive of BuzzFeed, sent a note to employees saying that Facebook News is part of a broader trend among platforms competing and paying for quality content.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s part of an old trend that they need quality, reliable, and engaging news as part of their bundles \u2014 and need to pay for it,\u201d Peretti wrote. \u201cOf course, we\u2019re still waiting for Google, in particular, and others to follow Facebook\u2019s lead in recognizing the real value they extract from original journalism.\"\n\nThe News tab marks a new phase in Facebook\u2019s approach to online news. Before January 2018, the company had been a leading distributor of news, but that role was dogged by the presence in its news feed of false and misleading information, as well as allegations that its news feed and other features tilted toward liberal viewpoints. So last year the company shifted its focus to promote posts from a user\u2019s friends and family, but the revamped news feed also hurt traffic for many news outlets that had tailored their offerings to appeal to Facebook\u2019s audience.\n\nFacebook\u2019s plan to pay at least some of the participating outlets for their content is in part intended to assuage complaints that tech platforms have siphoned off major revenue streams from news outlets \u2014 classified advertising is one example \u2014 while paying nothing for the articles and images that appeared on the site. Scores of news outlets have closed and hundreds more are struggling with falling revenue and declining readership while tech platforms have seen their profits boom.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe News tab will be formally introduced at 1 p.m. Friday at a New York event where Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg will take questions from Robert Thomson, chief executive of News Corp., the parent company of the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBrown said the News tab is the result of years of conversations with news organizations \u201cto figure out what role our platform can best play.\u201d Brown said that publishers didn\u2019t want to offer additional content without anything in return and that the news outlets felt strongly that Facebook needed to find a way to showcase original and local reporting beyond the top stories of the day.\n\nThe result is a designated space where news stories will appear, selected by both a small team of journalists and an algorithm that will identify stories based on a readers\u2019 interests. Anne Kornblut, a former deputy national editor for The Post, is overseeing the team of journalists who will choose top stories, according to people familiar with planning for the service. Kornblut joined Facebook in 2015.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe initial phase will highlight reporting from some of the country\u2019s largest metro areas, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Philadelphia, Houston, Washington, Miami, Atlanta and Boston. (Facebook also runs Today In, a local news page that now covers more than 6,000 towns and cities.)\n\nUnder the arrangement, Facebook will pay dozens of news organizations for content that doesn\u2019t appear elsewhere on the platform. Those payments will range from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars annually, depending on the outlet\u2019s size and its contribution to the service, people familiar with the plan told The Post. Outlets that don\u2019t receive payments will be able to make money from advertising when Facebook features their stories.\n\nFacebook News will abide by outlets\u2019 paywall policies. Readers can also link their paid news subscriptions to their Facebook accounts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTech giants are increasingly stepping into news aggregation for revenue and expanded audiences. Apple earlier this year launched its Apple News+ subscription service, which for $9.99 a month offers outlets including the Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times and a slew of magazines. The Post and The Times did not join the service after complaints that the financial terms offered little opportunity for publishers to generate meaningful revenue or bring in new paying subscribers. Another service, called Apple News, is free to users.\n\nAsked why this was an important initiative for Facebook now, Brown said there was an urge to engage with \u201cpeople who care deeply about news.\u201d\n\n\u201cFacebook is a place where people come to look for news,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe are a source of distribution for publishers, and we can\u2019t wait to be a better source of distribution.\u201d\n\nCraig Timberg contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Friday marks a new phase in Facebook\u2019s approach to online news, particularly after the company shifted the focus of its news feed last year to promote posts shared by family and friends.", "authors": ["Rachel Siegel", "National Business Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/u_-8gLQk2_fA4HS-1MRJ0UjEmp8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T2CDT5WUZYI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
