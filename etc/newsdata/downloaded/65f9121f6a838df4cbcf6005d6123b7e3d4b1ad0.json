The creatures aren\u2019t all-powerful beings that pop out of lamps, and they don\u2019t grant any wishes. Instead, they\u2019re decidedly more down to earth, with the look of a hand-scrawled monster ripped out of a child\u2019s notebook. They aren\u2019t just different; they\u2019re also representative of the game as a whole: Concrete Genie is simple and rough around the edges, but with enough heart to fill the few short hours it lasts.\n\nConcrete Genie is a game about painting. You play as a young boy named Ash, a budding artist who is also subjected to a constant stream of bullying. When his tormenters steal his sketchbook and scatter his work, Ash sets off to find the pages littered throughout a rundown part of town called Denska. While searching, he discovers a magical being \u2014 one of the titular genies \u2014 called Luna, who just so happens to be a living version of one of his sketches. Ash also gets a giant paintbrush he can use to paint iridescent graffiti.\n\nA game about painting\n\nWhile most games have a single driving force, in Concrete Genie, there are several. While Ash is searching for his lost sketchbook pages, Luna also tasks him with bringing the dreary Denska to life through his paintings. These two goals are intertwined: as Ash rediscovers his art, it gives him more options for sprucing up the town. That includes bringing new genies to life, each with their own distinct magical abilities. At the same time, Ash has to avoid his bullies, who are frustratingly persistent in following him around.\n\nIt sounds complex, but essentially, you enter an area \u2014 whether it\u2019s an old lighthouse or an abandoned wharf \u2014 and make your way through it while finding all of the spots that need to be painted. Sometimes, this means simple Assassin\u2019s Creed-style climbing around on buildings; other times, it\u2019s light stealth play as you avoid the bullies. For the most part, though, Concrete Genie is made up of environmental puzzles as you help the genies \u2014 who can only live on walls \u2014 get through the level to help you get past particular obstacles. Some genies can push things out of your way, while others can light things on fire (in a good, helpful way).\n\nThere\u2019s just enough charm and warmth to make it worth the brief journey\n\nIt\u2019s all fairly simple, but you jump around between playstyles so much that the simplicity never really feels grating. And all of these elements are punctuated by the painting, which is really the highlight of the experience. Concrete Genie is probably the only game I\u2019ve played this year that uses the DualShock controller\u2019s gyro controls: in order to paint, you move the entire controller around, guiding Ash\u2019s brush. It works well enough, particularly because you don\u2019t have to be accurate at all. Even if you just toss some luminescent pine trees and butterflies up on a wall, it\u2019s going to look good. The best part is that when you meet a new genie, you actually get to design them yourself, using Ash\u2019s painting skills to craft a monster. It lends them an extra layer of handmade charm.\n\nConcrete Genie is messy, much like the adolescent story it tells. The storytelling can be a bit too on the nose \u2014 like graffiti calling Ash \u201cthe paint nerd\u201d \u2014 and the controls can be strangely complex at times, particularly in the last chapter when the game gets more action-heavy. But ultimately, it has just enough charm and warmth to make it worth the brief journey. They might not look like the genies you\u2019re expecting, but that\u2019s part of what makes them so memorable.", "description": "Concrete Genie, the latest PS4 release from Sony studio Pixelopus, is a bright, heartwarming game about a young boy named Ash who brings a dreary town to life through magic and painting.", "authors": ["Andrew Webster", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bz3BVyefrFeAVwQbKufaR7lBhs0=/0x75:3840x2085/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19278562/Review_Screen_Painting_Genie_no_UI.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
