LINDSEY GRAHAM: EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE BOTHERED BY WHAT DEMOCRATS ARE DOING TO TRUMP\n\nEric Trump said Democrats have been \u201cembarrassed\u201d twice already, referring to hearings with Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, respectively, and thus are trying again with a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d angle regarding his father and Ukraine.\n\n\u201cLook what happened to Kavanaugh. Look what happened the embarrassment that was the Democratic Party during the Kavanaugh hearings,\u201d Eric Trump told Hannity. \u201cLook what happened in the Mueller hearings. That poster child went out there and he looked like an absolute buffoon. Didn't put together a sentence, very clear he didn't write the report, very clear he was getting marched around by the Democrats.\u201d\n\nHILLARY CLINTON IS THE 'WORST LOSER I'VE EVER SEEN,' BRIAN KILMEADE SAYS\n\nHe said Rep. Adam Schiff, D.-Calif., has been trying to impeach his father since he took his oath of office.\n\n\u201cHe is 0-2 in terms of the Congressional hearings,\u201d Eric Trump said, adding that Schiff compromised the case by his office having contact with the whistleblower prior to the official filing of the complaint. \"He is involved in the case! He's compromised in case.\"\n\n\u201cThey march these people in the little cave, they leak to their friends in the media who will publish anything they want them to say,\u201d he said of House Democrats during the impeachment process.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEric Trump also touted all the things his father has accomplished while much of Congress has been investigating alleged wrongdoings under the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cLook at the USMCA [United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement], look at all of these things that can be done, whether it be health care, military, veterans, economy, more tax cuts -- all these other things my father wants to put through,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you know what the Congress has done? Twelve post offices. It's an absolute joke, Sean.\u201d", "description": "Eric Trump said Thursday Democrats are pursuing impeachment against his father President Trump as a \"smoke and mirror\" distraction\u00a0because \u201cthey know they can\u2019t win.\u201d", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/25/694940094001_6097533874001_6097529366001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
