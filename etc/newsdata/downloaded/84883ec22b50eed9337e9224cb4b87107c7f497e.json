He has come under fire for his expensive tastes, frivolous spending and prioritising his family's needs.\n\nThe king's older daughter Princess Sikhanyiso was appointed as a member of cabinet last year, stoking outrage among pro-democracy groups.\n\nHe is currently attending the UN general assembly in New York.\n\n\"It is not true that there is no money in this country,\" said Dludlu.\n\n\"The PM is not a problem, we know where our problem lies. We have a greedy king. The royal family impoverishes this country,\" he told AFP.\n\neSwatini ranked 144 out of 189 the UN's latest Human Development Index.\n\nAround two thirds of the country's 1.4 million inhabitants live below the poverty line.", "description": "Violent clashes erupted in eSwatini on Wednesday after police cracked down on civil servants protesting against low pay and rising living costs in Africa's last absolute monarchy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5573/f7e31dd43b704351ad667b6af5499054.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
