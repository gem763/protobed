Part of Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, the NHS unit has space for 14 in-patients.\n\nMima lives in Kent with her family \u2013 parents Emma and Robin, who runs his own financial PR company, her twin Amelia, and three other siblings Charlie, 28, Imogen, 26 and Arthur, 24.\n\nHere, with courage and rare self-awareness, Mima shares the diary of her daily fight with a condition that causes more deaths in women aged 15 to 24 than any other disease \u2013 and yet leaves many family members and friends of its victims at a loss to understand the terrible forces warring for control in these young women\u2019s minds and bodies...\n\nMima Hepburn, 22, has been battling anorexia for five years and voluntary entered an eating disorder unit to receive treatment last year. Pictured, now on the road to recovery\n\nMima in 2017 when she was hospitalised after collapsing, she was taken to A&E by her twin sister Amelia and their friend for tests\n\nMima in 2010, happy and healthy before the anorexia took hold of her. Emaciated in swimsuit on Cote D'Azur in 2016, when she was fully in the grip of the disease\n\nMonday September 17, 2018\n\nAnorexia is a devil that sits on my shoulder, hissing in my ear: the less you eat, the better you\u2019ll feel. It\u2019s a lie, I know it is. But my mental illness \u2013 because that\u2019s what anorexia is \u2013 traps me in an endless cycle of anxiety, obsessive routine and self-denial.\n\nI\u2019ve just been into four caf\u00e9s in 20 minutes. In the first, I saw a goat\u2019s cheese focaccia. I liked the sound of it, but anorexia whispered: \u2018Too many calories\u2019.\n\nSo I picked up a lower calorie, drearier-looking sandwich and this time the voice nagged: \u2018What a waste of calories! Just skip lunch.\u2019\n\nI walked away, then \u2013 my rational mind battling to regain control \u2013 went into another caf\u00e9 and grabbed a cheese toastie. Fewer calories, so just about okay. But anorexia piped up. \u2018It\u2019s not what you want. Don\u2019t waste calories!\u2019\n\nI dashed into another caf\u00e9, but they hadn\u2019t set up for lunch. \u2018Just skip it. It would be easier,\u2019 insisted anorexia in its beguiling way.\n\nDetermined not to be beaten, I rushed back to the caf\u00e9 with the focaccia and hurriedly bought one. I actually ate it.\n\nWas that the end? Of course not.\n\nGuilt flooded in like a tsunami. Anorexia does not give up. Every day it tries to sabotage me. It\u2019s just that some days it wins, other days I do.\n\nA selfie taken by Mima just days before her admission into Vincent Square Eating Disorder Unit, which is part of Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, the NHS unit has space for 14 in-patients\n\nMima was handed one of 100 places to train as a Norland Nanny, but in November 2018 during her first days training she is far from well\n\nThe Hepburn family, left to right: brother Charlie, 28, Mima, Imogen, 26, mother Emma, father Robin, Arthur, 24, and her twin Amelia in August 2017\n\nMima spoke of her anguish at hurting her twin because of the eating disorder: 'Medication eased the physical pain but nothing could quell the sense that for years I\u2019d put my twin through such mental torture'\n\nThursday November 22, 2018\n\nDay two on my first work placement as a trainee Norland Nanny, and I\u2019m incredibly proud to have won one of 100 places. I\u2019m determined to gain my BA in early years development, along with the prestigious Norland Diploma.\n\nBut when warm little hands cling to mine, I notice my fingers are always icy. I\u2019m cold to the bone, even in summer, and there is downy hair on my face and limbs \u2013 my body\u2019s strategy to keep me warm because I\u2019m so thin.\n\nI haven\u2019t had a period for three years. I\u2019m 5\u201910 and my BMI is 12 \u2013 severely underweight (the normal range is between 18.5 and 24.9).\n\nI\u2019m plagued with gastric problems, exhausted and my mind is fuzzy, unfocused. Who wants an anorexic to care for their children? If I can\u2019t care for myself, how on earth can I care for little ones?\n\nWednesday December 19, 2019\n\nI should have spent Monday evening with my twin Amelia at the Festival of Light in Kew Gardens. Instead I was in A&E at St Thomas\u2019 Hospital, London.\n\nI\u2019d felt nauseous during the afternoon, then in excruciating pain. I retched, then keeled over on a tube train. I felt as if one of my organs was failing; my body giving up, as my mother warned me it would.\n\nI was petrified. Over the years I\u2019ve had a battery of tests, from ECGs to bone density scans, but never this sort of pain.\n\nAmelia and our friend virtually carried me to hospital. As Amelia told emergency staff about my illness, her tears began. I felt guilty and ashamed.\n\nMedication eased the physical pain but nothing could quell the sense that for years I\u2019d put my twin through such mental torture.\n\nA panoply of tests did not reveal what had happened. But I know the disease is intent on inflicting more damage.\n\nDays before Christmas 2018, Mima is desperately thin, she writes in her diary: 'Last night anorexia convinced me Mummy\u2019s shepherd\u2019s pie was far too calorific, our family supper too late for my rigid schedule. My parents are distraught, of course'\n\nA stick thin selfie taken by Mima just before she went into hospital in January 2019 as her food obsession reaches an all-time high she is seeking help\n\nFriday December 21, 2018\n\nI\u2019ve just missed a family supper. Why, when I was so ill just days ago? Every day thoughts of food obsess me. I can\u2019t stop it. What did I eat yesterday? Will my usual routines be interrupted today? Do I deserve to eat? Will it be worth eating? Do I feel in control?\n\nAh. Control. That\u2019s the nub of it.\n\nYet I remember a time when I slathered butter on bread, fought to eat more biscuits than my brother Arthur and spooned golden syrup from the tin into my mouth. I ate ravenously and never put on weight.\n\nThen, six years ago, our lives started to fall apart. My parents had to sell our family home \u2013 a six-bedroom former rectory in Tunbridge Wells \u2013 because Dad\u2019s business was struggling in the financial crisis, and we moved into a rented house. Everything was in turmoil, and I wanted to create order.\n\nThat\u2019s when my obsession with food began. Portion sizes shrank; I skipped meals. It was Mum who first noticed, late in 2013. A few months later school was contacting my parents about my weight loss.\n\nI was furious when people started saying I had anorexia. Then a psychiatrist diagnosed me in 2015 and I thought: \u2018Maybe something isn\u2019t right.\u2019\n\nNow I really need to get back on track, to go back to Norland after the Christmas holidays.\n\nI was forced to give up the degree course in psychology I began at St Andrews in 2016, taking time out before starting Norland last September. I can\u2019t allow anorexia to beat me again.\n\nAged 16 in 2013, Mima wears a bikini on a family holiday just shortly before anorexia started to take hold of her\n\nIn 2015, Mima poses for a selfie revealing her slight frame. She says in her diary of her body: 'I notice my fingers are always icy. I\u2019m cold to the bone, even in summer, and there is downy hair on my face and limbs \u2013 my body\u2019s strategy to keep me warm because I\u2019m so thin'\n\nSunday December 23, 2018\n\nI cannot stand this vile illness any more.\n\nThis could be my last Christmas with my elderly grandparents, yet last night anorexia convinced me Mummy\u2019s shepherd\u2019s pie was far too calorific, our family supper too late for my rigid schedule. My parents are distraught, of course.\n\nInstead I ate a safer option \u2013 a bowl of soup \u2013 alone, in the early evening.\n\nNonetheless, I woke at 5am and was horribly sick. My stomach \u2013 unused to food \u2013 rebels when I eat. It is the antithesis of glamorous.\n\nWhat will I have to look back on, aged 40? Just empty hours alone, avoiding meals. At this rate, I\u2019ll be dead by 40, anyway.\n\nYesterday I weighed myself. I\u2019m thinner than ever. I don\u2019t want to say how little I weigh \u2013 I\u2019m all too aware it would encourage other sufferers to try to outdo me \u2013 but I know I look emaciated; like a victim of starvation, which I am.\n\nEven so, I feel a need to reduce my food intake more. Anorexia is stealing my fourth Christmas, my favourite time of year. I love the carols, the church services by candlelight, exchanging carefully-chosen gifts. But most of all I love being with my family.\n\nYet I deny myself all those things, obsessing about what I can eat. Anorexia creates misery out of joy.\n\nIt makes me lie to my parents \u2013 I tell them I\u2019ve eaten when I haven\u2019t \u2013 and it makes them cry.\n\nMima (pictured in 2015) shares how she would lie to her parents that she had eaten and she can't enjoy Christmas time: 'Yet I deny myself all those things, obsessing about what I can eat. Anorexia creates misery out of joy'\n\nMonday January 7 2019\n\nMy doctors say I\u2019m too unwell to return to Norland. Immediately anorexia pipes up: \u2018See, you\u2019ve failed again. But you can succeed at being an anorexic.\u2019\n\nI\u2019m split in two. I\u2019m livid with myself, but anorexia hisses: \u2018What did you expect? I said you wouldn\u2019t cope.\u2019\n\nEven so, I\u2019ve agreed to do the thing that scares me most; an in-patient admission to hospital. And I\u2019m one of the \u2018lucky\u2019 ones. You have to be ill enough \u2013 your weight critical and your bloods messed up \u2013 to be put on the waiting list at all.\n\nYou might be thinking: why doesn\u2019t she just eat? But if it was that simple, believe me, I\u2019d have beaten it by now.\n\nNow I just have to wait for a bed in an eating disorder unit to become available.\n\nFriday Jan 11, 2019\n\nI\u2019ve just read about an anorexic girl who hanged herself. One out of five people with anorexia die from it in some way.\n\nYet it is still not taken seriously\u2026 until it\u2019s too late. It makes me both terrified and angry.\n\nThe horrific toll anorexia has taken on Mima's body is clearly visible and she laments in her diary about how she is desperate to help herself after weighing herself at her thinnest\n\nSunday Jan 27, 2019\n\nI\u2019m going into hospital on Tuesday (29 Jan). There my body will slowly be acclimatised to food again until I reach 3,000 calories a day.\n\nMealtimes will take 45 minutes, followed by periods in which patients share their stories, supervised by nurses. There is art therapy, a body image group, exercise; but I believe more time should be spent on mental re-wiring and the cognitive processes that make an anorexic.\n\nWhile \u2018terrified\u2019 would be a vast understatement, I also have hope. My parents gently remind me that this is the only option now.\n\nAnorexia ceaselessly holds me accountable for every morsel that passes my lips. The thought of others taking over that responsibility for a while is a kind of relief.\n\nOf course, anorexia never gives up. I can feel it trying to change my mind.\n\nBut I finally know what I need to do, because I\u2019ve reached rock bottom. I\u2019m immensely grateful to my medical team \u2013 especially my nurse Sharon \u2013 who\u2019ve worked tirelessly to get me a bed.\n\nTuesday January 29, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s a cold, grey day as I walk into the unit and see young women as weak as me wandering the corridors. The smell of vomit hits me. Yet I feel calm.\n\nThere are medical tests; then I\u2019m taken to my room, sparse as a prison cell. The windows have grilles to prevent me escaping; the door has a window so staff can check on me.\n\nI\u2019m glad this is a unit for eating disorders, not a general psychiatric ward. The NHS nurses and consultants are excellent. Although private clinics like the Priory have less basic facilities, the care is better here.\n\nAfter spending nearly three months in the eating disorder unit Mima begun to build a relationship with food again and is slowly learning with the help of medical experts\n\nSunday February 3\n\nWoken for weigh-in at 6am, so very tired. This happens daily for the first week, then twice a week thereafter.\n\nThe nurses don\u2019t comment on your weight. You can choose to look, or not. It is the consultant who comments, on his rounds, on how much you weigh.\n\nAnd I couldn\u2019t be more proud. I\u2019m doing it. I\u2019m putting on weight. Scary as it is, I\u2019m getting better!\n\nTuesday February 5\n\nA clanging alarm has just gone off. Nurses and a doctor rush in. A patient who arrived the day after me has stopped breathing. Sudden cardiac arrests are a common cause of death among anorexics, a grim truth I\u2019ve tried not to face. Now it\u2019s horrifyingly evident.\n\nThankfully medics got here in time, and the girl is stable, in intensive care.\n\nBut I\u2019m deeply shaken. Anorexia kills.\n\nThursday February 7\n\nArthur arrives out of the blue, throws his arms round me and tells me how proud he is. I feel the old Mima \u2013 the girl who won the Perseverance Cup at school \u2013 returning.\n\nMima, wearing a Fortnum and Mason uniform, explained how she would be fed microwaved meals on the unit in a bid to make sure she was having enough calories\n\nSaturday February 9\n\nI\u2019m not sure how, but I'm on day 12 here. When I arrived I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d last the first night.\n\nFood still feels like a punishment \u2013 an endless procession of microwaved meals (sweet and sour chicken, cheese flan, bean hotpot) with school dinner-style puds like stewed plums and custard. (The NHS budget is limited \u2013 I realise that \u2013 and each meal must be sufficiently calorific.) The nurses make you virtually lick your plate.\n\nBut they are generally understanding. Some are very firm, but I learn not to mistake this for meanness.\n\nMy favourite, Nurse Dorris, says: \u2018I\u2019m fighting the anorexia, not you!\u2019 Among the patients, some of those facing the hardest battles have the kindest hearts. And we do manage to laugh now and again.\n\nSunday February 10\n\nMummy visits \u2013 I have 30 minutes\u2019 leave each day now, so we amble down the Kings Road in winter sunshine, which feels magical.\n\nLater we sip peppermint tea and she reminds me to grasp this opportunity with both hands. My parents are relentlessly loving and understanding.\n\nTuesday February 12\n\nYesterday doctors added a new medication to help my digestion. (I also take vitamins, and a drug to help my low mood.)\n\nThere is a rare side effect to the new medicine \u2013 unfortunately I get it, developing extreme anxiety. I\u2019m beside myself; petrified, tearful, restless. Mummy visits and I burst into tears.\n\nPictured in 2013, Mima was happy until her parents had to sell their family home \u2013 a six-bedroom former rectory in Tunbridge Wells \u2013 because her father's business was struggling in the financial crisis\n\nIn March this year Mima celebrated her 22nd birthday and asked for no presents only wishing for her own recovery from anorexia\n\nFriday February 15\n\nI\u2019m taken off the medication at once and thankfully the panic attacks have subsided.\n\nI know that being here has saved me from myself; but still I want nothing more than to go home.\n\nHere, anorexia has nowhere to hide. It is not my friend, but my enemy. And even when I can\u2019t fight any longer, the team here will fight for me.\n\nI\u2019ve been here three weeks and have experienced the most intense feelings of despair. I\u2019ve felt imprisoned; that I\u2019ve lost all control. Yet I\u2019ve kept eating and I\u2019m still here. I\u2019ve gained a little weight, too.\n\nI find myself scraping mush into my mouth, reciting: \u2018It\u2019s my medicine, it\u2019s my medicine. This is temporary\u2019.\n\nFriday March 1\n\nYesterday was my 22nd birthday \u2013 possibly my most special one ever. I didn\u2019t ask for presents. All I want is to recover.\n\nAnorexia still pipes up constantly, but treatment has helped me ignore it. Some say the voice never goes; you just learn to live with it. Others silence it forever. I hope I will.\n\nToday is day 32. I recite the mantra, \u2018If I survived yesterday, I will do so today, too.\u2019\n\nSaturday March 30\n\nI\u2019m finding things hard. New patients with very complex problems have arrived, so alarms go off frequently, while some patients have to be restrained multiple times each day. I feel like I\u2019m losing hope of living a \u2018normal\u2019 life again.\n\nThursday April 4\n\nAt ward rounds, I learn I\u2019m being discharged. I haven\u2019t reached the weight target my doctors hoped for \u2013 but they\u2019ve agreed I can leave because my family are moving to Norwich soon. My new care team is in place there.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not sure that I could have coped for much longer with the new disruptions. My team seem a bit anxious, but have agreed to respect my wishes.\n\nMima's family have stood firmly by her side as she makes a bid to fight the disease once and for all, saying now that she is making small steps towards her bigger goal to be healthy\n\nTuesday April 16\n\nI\u2019m so happy to be back with my family. I\u2019m settling in to life in Norwich with my parents, and it is going much better than I had anticipated.\n\nI see my new Eating Disorder team weekly, and I have an hour a week with a therapist \u2013 who also tracks my weight.\n\nFriday May 3\n\nBefore I went into hospital, a friend who\u2019s doing a year abroad in Seville promised I could visit her after treatment. I feel so proud to have made it here, to see her.\n\nBut every moment we share \u2013 seeing the city sights, relaxing at her flat \u2013 feels tarnished by anorexia\u2019s unwelcome presence. I realise I have a long way to go, still.\n\nToday\n\nSo, what am I up to now? I spoke to the Norland Academy just yesterday about finishing my course, and they couldn\u2019t have been more supportive. We\u2019ve agreed I\u2019ll return to study in January \u2013 a real goal to work towards.\n\nIn the meantime, I\u2019m dedicating all my time to beating this thing. My nurse says, \u2018recovery is your full-time job at the moment\u2019. Sometimes I can\u2019t believe how draining it is.\n\nI also hope to visit my twin, who\u2019s studying at Oxford, and a few other friends \u2013 regaining some of the time I\u2019ve already lost with them.\n\nAnorexia is a thief that steals so much from its sufferers, but perversely it has also made me treasure the small, everyday things that yield so much joy.\n\nWhat sustains me are the staff and fellow patients who helped me so much, my dear family and supportive friends.\n\nRead more on Mima\u2019s blog 'Mending Mima' here.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Mima Hepburn, 22, lives in Kent with her family.
