The roads aren't maintained with salt or sand because the area is environmentally sensitive, the NCC says.\n\nInstead, they're turned into cross-country ski trails over the winter, and usually re-open to vehicles in early May.\n\nThere are two exceptions: roads to the Luskville Falls will stay open during the daytime only, while the Lac La P\u00eache area has been closed since Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nThe Huron and Champlain lookouts are getting some maintenance work done Monday to Wednesday, but won't be fully closed to visitors.", "description": "After a busy autumn,\u00a0Gatineau Park's parkways are getting ready to close to vehicles for the season.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5323173.1571252063!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/gatineau-park-autumn-fall-leaves-traffic-ottawa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
