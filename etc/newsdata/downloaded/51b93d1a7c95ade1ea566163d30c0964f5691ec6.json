The controversial figure has announced he will finally stand down on October 31.\n\nIn recent months, Mr Bercow has come under fire for a series of controversial rulings in the chamber which were widely considered to favour Remain supporters.\n\nHe previously admitted to voting Remain in the 2016 referendum and his wife's car bears a 'b******* to Brexit' sticker. Part of the Speaker's role is to remain neutral.\n\nJohn Bercow (pictured) will get the casting vote on the Brexit deal if Saturday's Commons showdown results in a tie\n\nDr Alice Lilly, of the Institute for Government, said: 'There are certain principles \u2013 known as Speaker Denison's principles \u2013 that set out how Speakers are expected to exercise the casting vote.\n\n'The main principles are that the Speaker's vote should not create a majority where there isn't one, that they should not change the status quo, and that they should vote in a way that does not make any final decisions and that does allow time for further discussion of an issue. In terms of a straight vote on the Government's deal being tied, it's probable that the Speaker would vote against the motion, on the grounds of not creating a majority where one doesn't already exist in the House.\n\n'However, it is also possible that the Speaker could interpret the situation differently, leading him to vote for the motion \u2013 for example, if he felt that voting for the motion could create time for more debate on the deal in the form of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.'", "description": "John Bercow will get the casting vote on the Brexit deal if Saturday's Commons showdown results in a tie.It's possible that an equal number of MPs vote in favour of and against the agreement.", "authors": ["John Stevens Deputy Political Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/22/19903650-0-image-a-12_1571432517013.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
