Obviously the legislation around the environment is getting clearer as well. It is the track we are on in terms of the development of the new fully electrified line up.\"\n\nThe European Union has set new rules for carmakers to reduce carbon dioxide vehicle emissions from next year, or face fines.", "description": "Honda brings forward goal to be fully electrified in Europe to 2022", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9M1C4_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
