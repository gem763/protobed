REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party should campaign against Brexit and push for a referendum to reverse the planned departure before any election, the party\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, is due to say on Wednesday.\n\nIn a speech that is at odds with the stance of Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, Watson will say there is \u201cno such thing as a good Brexit deal\u201d and Labour must campaign unequivocally to remain, the BBC said.\n\n\u201cThe only way to break the Brexit deadlock once and for all is a public vote in a referendum,\u201d Watson will say, according to the BBC. \u201cA general election might well fail to solve this Brexit chaos.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as a good Brexit deal, which is why I believe we should advocate for remain,\u201d he will say.\n\nWatson will say that while an autumn election seems inevitable \u201cthat does not make it desirable\u201d.\n\nCorbyn has said he wants an election and that Labour will then offer a referendum with both leave and remain options.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party argues that Labour wants to ignore the outcome of the 2016 referendum and the public\u2019s view that Brexit should be delivered.\n\nThe 2016 Brexit referendum showed a United Kingdom divided about much more than the European Union, and has fuelled soul-searching about everything from secession and immigration to capitalism, empire and modern Britishness.\n\nIt has also triggered civil war inside both of Britain\u2019s main political parties as dozens of lawmakers put what they see as the United Kingdom\u2019s fate above that of party loyalty.", "description": "Britain's opposition Labour Party should campaign against Brexit and push for a referendum to reverse the planned departure before any election, the party's deputy leader, Tom Watson, is due to say on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428595044&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8926M", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
