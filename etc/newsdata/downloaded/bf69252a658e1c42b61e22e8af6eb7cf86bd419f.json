Dunn was killed on Aug. 27 in Croughton, a small village in central England, when his motorcycle collided with a Volvo SUV traveling in the opposite direction, police said.\"The Foreign Secretary met the US Ambassador today and urged the US to reconsider its position and do the right thing by Harry Dunn's family,\" the foreign office said in a statement Tuesday.Anne Sacoolas, 42, the wife of a U.S. diplomat, is being treated as a suspect in the investigation, police said. It is not clear when exactly Sacoolas departed the U.K., but police told NBC News that they were advised Sept. 16 that she had already left the country.Sky News, which is owned by NBC News' parent company Comcast, reported that Jonathan Sacoolas was not on the published list of accredited diplomats in the U.K..
