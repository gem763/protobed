I was a teenager and I lost my mother and sister - they were killed. I really wanted to look into the long term effects of war and taking from my personal experience of dealing with PTSD (post-war stress disorder) and nightmares.\u201d\n\nThe film follows Lume (Adriana Matoshi), an Albanian woman who lives with her husband Ilir (Astrit Kabashi) and mother-in-law Remzije (Fatmire Sahiti).\n\nHaving lost her only child a decade earlier in the war, Lume is haunted by night terrors and unable to conceive.\n\nDesperate to fill a void, her family pressures her to seek magical healers to treat her infertility.
