Protesters dispersed and occupied an adjacent major road.\n\nThe police said \u201cviolent protesters\u201d had damaged property and aimed laser beams at a helicopter, \u201cposing a serious threat to the safety of everyone at the scene\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People shine laser beams at a rally in the Admiralty area of Hong Kong.

They also threw petrol bombs at police.\n\nHong Kong was braced for consecutive days of protests and probable clashes, culminating with anti-government demonstrations on Tuesday to coincide with China\u2019s National Day, a politically important anniversary marking 70 years since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s legislature put out a \u201cred alert\u201d, evacuating staff and politicians from the legislative complex, which protesters have previously broken into. Dozens of riot police vans were parked nearby, and water barriers protected the government building.\n\nProtesters clad in black, with gas masks and helmets, were also preparing for clashes. \u201cThe Hong Kong police are attacking our protesters and the force is unnecessary,\u201d said a 22-year-old man, who planned to be on the frontline of protests to try to protect other demonstrators. He asked not to give his name for fear of arrest.\n\n\u201cWhat we really want is not to fight with police; all we want is to protect the people who are peaceful so they can safely leave,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, protesters hung banners and plastered posters outside the complex, building a \u201cLennon wall,\u201d named after the John Lennon Wall in Prague, for political graffiti and messages. A group of masked musicians and singers performed the song Glory to Hong Kong, which has become the protesters\u2019 anthem.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People look at posters on the \u2018Lennon wall\u2019.

Demonstrators hung large banners in yellow, the colour of the Umbrella movement, with the words: \u201cWe are back.\u201d\n\nThe protests, which began in June over an extradition bill, have now lasted longer than the Umbrella movement and have expanded both in scope and tactics. The mostly non-violent 2014 protests were concentrated on a major road outside the government buildings.\n\nThe recent demonstrations have sprung up across the city under the mantra \u201cBe water\u201d \u2013 a quote from the actor Bruce Lee. The protesters\u2019 demands echo those in 2014 \u2013 the implementation of genuine universal suffrage \u2013 but have also demanded an independent inquiry into police behaviour and reforms to the police force, which has lost considerable public trust.\n\nThe protests have often turned violent, with police firing thousands of rounds of teargas and pepper spray on protesters, as well as deploying water cannon. Protesters have also increasingly been physically attacking critics and people they accuse of being \u201cmainland spies\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A woman who was beaten after removing anti-government posters is treated by medics.

Other protesters tried to protect the woman and treat a head wound as the attack continued.\n\n\u201cThese people started beating me up for no reason,\u201d she said, declining to give her name. She acknowledged she had torn down the protesters\u2019 posters but criticised them for not allowing her to express her views.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that people with different political views should be beaten up,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you encourage democracy, freedom of speech, this is not the way that people should do [it].\u201d\n\nDespite the violence, the protesters maintain broad public support. \u201cIf I were 50 years younger, I would be out there at the front with them,\u201d said Ng Yin Fai, 72, who has been joining the protests since June. \u201cIf we don\u2019t protest today, we won\u2019t have this chance again.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 5:02 Uncle Wong, 82: protecting Hong Kong protesters with his walking stick \u2013 video\n\nOn Saturday a US academic who testified in a congressional hearing alongside democracy activists last week was denied entry to Hong Kong. Dan Garrett said officials told him he could not enter because of \u201cunspecified immigration reasons\u201d.\n\nA government spokesman, responding to protesters\u2019 calls for universal suffrage, said \u201cone man, one vote\u201dwas the ultimate goal, as enshrined in Hong Kong\u2019s constitution.\n\n\u201cTo achieve this aim, the community needs to engage in dialogues, premised on the legal basis and under a peaceful atmosphere with mutual trust, with a view to narrowing differences and attaining a consensus agreeable to all sides,\u201d the government said in a statement.\n\nResidents said that while they were scared of potential arrest or violence from the police, they would continue to protest. \u201cSome of us may feel scared deep inside when we see the police. We feel scared by being simply young or just wearing black,\u201d said Yen, a secretary in her 30s, as she glued black paper stars with the words \u201cLiberate Hong Kong\u201d on to a pavement.\n\nShe said China\u2019s influence over Hong Kong had grown since the Umbrella movement ended, with the press and freedom of expression being stifled and pro-democracy activists being charged and jailed.\n\n\u201cJust being frightened is not an excuse for us, because we have no way back,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t go back to our normal state where China is taking over.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Laurel Chor", "description": "Police fire teargas as thousands rally to mark five-year anniversary of pro-democracy movement", "authors": ["Lily Kuo", "Erin Hale"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c17b7a64de5d4fd071c394043c7fc58951d247f9/369_326_3069_1842/master/3069.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=20b496e6b0f9b730bb2963521057e282", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
