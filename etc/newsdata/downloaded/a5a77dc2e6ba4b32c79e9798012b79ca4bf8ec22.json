Especially alarming to league and union officials was a statement put out by the Skaggs family last week that suggested that an Angels employee might have been involved in providing access to the drugs.\n\nOpioid painkillers, which include such prescription medications as Vicodin and Percocet, are at the center of the nation\u2019s foremost public-health crisis, which has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans each year.\n\nProfessional baseball players fit the demographic of those most commonly affected by opioid addiction. They are young, and their jobs frequently leave them with pain to manage. Skaggs, who was about two weeks away from his 28th birthday when he died, had an extensive injury history, including Tommy John elbow surgery in 2014.\n\n\u201cIndividuals in occupations where they\u2019re prone to injury are more likely to be exposed to opioids and are more likely to become addicted,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, the executive director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing.\n\nNonetheless, MLB doesn\u2019t believe the league has a widespread opioid problem. Minor-leaguers, who aren\u2019t represented by the players\u2019 union, are tested regularly for drugs of abuse. Of the roughly 75,000 tests administered in the past five years, only 10 came back positive for opioids.\n\nIn the last two rounds of collective bargaining, MLB has proposed mandatory testing for drugs of abuse. Though players have been receptive to expanded testing for performance-enhancing drugs, they have so far resisted more testing for other substances, citing privacy concerns.\n\nBaseball considers any substance classified as Schedule I and II as defined by the U.S. Controlled Substances Act as a \u201cdrug of abuse.\u201d That includes marijuana, which is legal for recreational use in some states. It is conceivable that talks between MLB and the players\u2019 union would involve more testing for certain drugs, such as opioids, but not others.\n\n\u201cMLB reviews and updates its drug programs regularly, including an annual review of the Joint Drug Program at the end of each season with the Players Association,\u201d MLB said in a statement. \u201cThis year, that review will include a thorough review of the Drug of Abuse aspects of our Joint Drug Program, as well as the content and delivery of our player education programs prior to next season.\u201d\n\nDoctors registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration and having a state license can prescribe players an opioid painkiller for short-term use without triggering the reasonable-cause clause that would prompt further testing.\n\nIn recent years, MLB has provided guidance to teams reiterating that they can\u2019t travel with any controlled substance and explaining storage and record- keeping requirements if a player is prescribed with one. The memo also emphasizes that athletic trainers can\u2019t dispense or administer any controlled substance, nor can a physician\n\nIn practice, however, players aren\u2019t typically prescribed opioid painkillers by team-affiliated doctors. Several players said in recent interviews that the strongest medication they had ever been prescribed for pain was an anti-inflammatory, such as Voltaren. A player can theoretically apply for a therapeutic-use exemption to allow long-term use of a banned drug, though the league hasn\u2019t granted one for opioids.\n\nThe Skaggs family has hired prominent Texas attorney Rusty Hardin as police in Southlake, Texas, continue to investigate Skaggs\u2019 death.\n\nWrite to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com", "description": "Major League Baseball and the players\u2019 union expect to discuss changes to the sport\u2019s drug program after an autopsy revealed that Los Angeles Angels pitcher Tyler Skaggs had oxycodone, fentanyl and alcohol in his system.", "authors": ["Jared Diamond"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104997/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
