(Image: Lucasfilm/Del Rey)\n\nAfter the events of The Last Jedi, Star Wars\u2019 latest hotshot pilot hero Poe Dameron has been knocked all the way back on his arse \u2014 not just by the First Order\u2019s shattering of the Resistance fleet, but by harsh lessons learned about his own pride. But now that the Resistance needs allies old and new, has Poe really taken his misjudgement to heart?\n\nYou can find out in our new look inside Rebecca Roanhorse\u2019s Resistance Reborn \u2014 the upcoming novel that tells the tale of what Leia and her remaining allies are up to between The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker.\n\nPublished by Del Rey and picking up immediately as Last Jedi ends, Resistance Reborn sees Leia, Rose, Rey, Finn and Poe fan out across the galaxy in search of the allies the Resistance desperately needs after the losses they suffered at Crait.\n\nThe full cover for Resistance Reborn. (Image: Lucasfilm/Del Rey)\n\nSome of them will be new faces, thrust into the fight against the First Order in light of Luke Skywalker\u2019s legendary sacrifice.\n\nSome, as you\u2019ll find out in our excerpt below, will be faces Star Wars fans are more than familiar with. But old or new, not all of them are going to be so willing to sign up to a new galactic civil war...\n\nCheck out Poe\u2019s crisis of confidence as he heads to the planet Ephemera \u2014 a former mining colony now being turned into an intergalactic resort world called \u201cWish\u201d \u2014 and tries to recruit one of those familiar faces below.\n\n\u201cIt was a great castle,\u201d Poe admitted.\n\n\u201cThe best. Do you know how long I had had it?\u201d\n\n\u201cA thousand years?\u201d\n\n\u201cA thou . . .\u201d She paused, giving Poe a suspicious look. He grinned playfully. \u201cLonger than you\u2019ve been around, flyboy, that\u2019s for sure. So don\u2019t sniff at me like I\u2019m being unreasonable.\u201d\n\nShe dipped her hand in the gelatinous goop that filled the bowl next to her and brought back a handful of something pink and smooth that smelled distinctly of sulphur. She leaned out of her re\u00adcliner, offering some to Poe. \u201cYou want?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\nThey were both sitting on long sinuous loungers in one of Wish\u2019s ubiquitous day spas. Poe was still in his uniform, small mercy, but Maz was wrapped in a thick fluffy white towel, a second white towel wrapped tightly around her head. Her bare feet soaked in a mix of muddy chemicals Poe couldn\u2019t identify, and willowy attendants flut\u00adtered in and out of the room, proffering teas and colonics and other concoctions Poe politely refused. Maz was now smearing the sulphur-scented goop she had offered Poe on her broad cheeks and humming merrily.\n\n\u201cWhat is that stuff?\u201d he asked, sniffing. \u201cIt smells terrible.\u201d The sul\u00adfur odor had been replaced with an ammonia one.\n\n\u201cFeline poop. From some species that\u2019s lived here so long that it\u2019s practically native to the planet. Imagine. A planet with no solid ground but plenty of cats. The story is that the founder of Ephemera was a Rothkahar philosopher. He domesticated this species because he thought them of advanced intelligence . . . or maybe they domes\u00adticated him. I forget. Anyway, later on, he found that their excrement had healing properties. High concentrations of tibanna gas, naturally processed into tuusah.\u201d She laughed again. \u201cDoes wonders for the skin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great, Maz,\u201d Poe said, thinking it was not great at all, \u201cbut can we get back to the topic at hand? The Resistance needs your help.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you told me.\u201d\n\nBut you didn\u2019t seem to hear me, he thought. He needed to get through to her, and he decided brutal honesty was his best bet. \u201cWe need a place to hide and regroup. It needs to be outside of prying First Order eyes but able to handle our needs for housing, supplies, communications . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you say there were only a handful of you left on a single ship? What needs could you have?\u201d\n\nPoe bristled at her callousness. Maybe she had heard him, and she just didn\u2019t care. He hadn\u2019t expected that. \u201cThere will be more,\u201d he said hastily. \u201cWe\u2019ve got people all over the galaxy, and we\u2019re making new allies all the time. We were hoping you could provide shelter. And more than that. Leadership. Leia can\u2019t do it alone. We need you to help lead the Resistance.\u201d\n\n\u201cLead the Resistance? I thought that was your job.\u201d\n\n\u201cI . . .\u201d Poe frowned, feeling unsettled.\n\n\u201cExpecting me to do your job for you?\u201d she grumbled, now duti\u00adfully applying the cream to her neck. \u201cYou\u2019re the commander in the room. Or has that changed?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing\u2019s changed,\u201d Poe said automatically, but it was a lie, wasn\u2019t it? After the Raddus, everything had changed.\n\nMaz finished shellacking her throat and sat back in her chair, eyes closed. The last attendant had left a steaming pot of tea on the side table, and Maz blindly reached a hand out, found her cup, and lifted it to her lips to take a sip. She set the teacup down. Poe waited pa\u00adtiently for her to speak, but after a moment he could hear light snor\u00ading. Had she fallen asleep?\n\nPoe stood up, exasperated. \u201cThis was a waste of time. I should go.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Her hand closed around his wrist like a vise, all the whimsy fled from her voice as if it had never been there. She cocked one eye open, fixing it on him. He froze.\n\n\u201cListen closely to me, Poe Dameron,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see me like this, and you think me a fool. Good for me, because when an enemy perceives you as foolish or weak, that is when they are most vulner\u00adable in their arrogance. That is when you strike.\u201d She twisted her hand, pulling hard, and his feet flew out from under him. He went down on his back, hard enough that a bellowing breath escaped from his lungs and pain radiated from his tailbone.\n\nMaz was up off her recliner and standing on his chest in seconds. Her eyes, surrounded by the sulfurous skin treatment, were centime\u00adters from his own. She narrowed her gaze, taking him in. Judging. \u201cI see arrogance in you. And that is what gets you in trouble, causes pain.\u201d\n\nHe flushed, still thinking of the Raddus. \u201cI learned my lesson,\u201d he spit through gritted teeth.\n\n\u201cHave you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI . . .\u201d Poe collapsed back, resting his head on the floor. He thought about lying, or at least not telling Maz any more than necessary, but she looked at him like she could see right through him, like she al\u00adready knew the ugly truth.\n\n\u201cYou asked me if I was still a leader,\u201d he started, eyes focused on the ceiling. \u201cThe truth is that I don\u2019t know. I-I made some mis\u00adtakes . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMistakes?\u201d Maz\u2019s tone was scalpel-sharp.\n\n\u201cI led a mutiny,\u201d he confessed. He hadn\u2019t meant to tell her, but there it was. And now that he had begun, he wanted her to know everything. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what was happening. All I knew was that we were running, when we should have been fighting. I had to do something!\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you? Have to do something?\u201d\n\nHe blinked, taken off guard. A moment ago he had wanted to de\u00adfend himself, to make her see reason or at least understand his rea\u00adsoning. But suddenly all that fight was gone and reality hit him like a punch to the gut.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019m a soldier and she was my commanding officer. All I had to do was trust.\u201d He exhaled, instinctively wanting to sink farther into the floor, to hide from his own dishonor. He looked at her, eyes pleading for . . . not sympathy. Not even understanding. But something else. A second chance.\n\nMaz made a humming sound. She leaned her head away from him and sat back. She didn\u2019t get off his chest, but at least there was some distance between their faces.\n\n\u201cAnd now what, Poe Dameron?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re right. That your actions, your arrogance, got many people killed. Led the Resistance to where they are now: bro\u00adken, on the run, destitute, and begging for help.\u201d\n\nHe flinched. Opened his mouth to protest her words, but what was there to say besides \u201cI fix it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow will you do that?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou can\u2019t bring the dead back. You can\u2019t single-handedly rebuild the Resistance, although\u2014\u201d She snorted, sounding amused. \u201c\u2014if anyone was going to try it would be you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can bring down the First Order.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlone?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I have to.\u201d\n\nMaz shook her head. \u201cArrogance. Still.\u201d", "description": "After the events of The Last Jedi, Star Wars\u2019 latest hotshot pilot hero Poe Dameron has been knocked all the way back on his arse \u2014 not just by the First Order\u2019s shattering of the Resistance fleet, but by harsh lessons learned about his own pride.
