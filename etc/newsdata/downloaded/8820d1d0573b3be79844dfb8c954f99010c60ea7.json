(CSE: MMEN) (OTCQX: MMNFF) (\u201cMedMen\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a leading cannabis retailer with operations across the U.S., today announced that Stacey Hallerman has resigned from the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, effective immediately. Ms. Hallerman has left her position on MedMen\u2019s Board to assume the role of Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel at Lowell Herb Co. (\u201cLowell\u201d).\n\n\u201cOn behalf of my fellow directors, MedMen\u2019s management team and our shareholders, I\u2019d like to thank Stacey for her valuable contributions to our board,\u201d said Adam Bierman, MedMen co-founder and chief executive officer. \u201cMedMen has been a strong supporter of Lowell from the start, and we look forward to finding additional ways to work with Stacey in her new role at Lowell. We wish her the best of luck in her future endeavors.\u201d\n\nLowell was one of MedMen\u2019s first strategic investments into a cannabis brand. Back in July 2018, the Company announced an investment in the Lowell Herb Co. At the time, a main driver for the investment was that Lowell and MedMen shared a similar vision of cannabis as a consumer product, and that shared vision endures. MedMen currently sells Lowell\u2019s products across its California network.\n\nAbout MedMen:\n\nFounded in 2010, MedMen is North America\u2019s premium cannabis retailer. Founders Adam Bierman and Andrew Modlin have defined the next generation discovery platform for cannabis and all its benefits. A robust selection of high-quality products, including MedMen-owned brands [statemade], LuxLyte and MedMen Red, coupled with a team of cannabis-educated associates cement the Company\u2019s commitment to providing an unparalleled experience. MedMen\u2019s industry-leading technology enables a fully compliant, owned-and-operated delivery service and MedMen Buds, a nationwide loyalty program.\n\nMedMen believes that a world where cannabis is legal and regulated is safer, healthier and happier.
