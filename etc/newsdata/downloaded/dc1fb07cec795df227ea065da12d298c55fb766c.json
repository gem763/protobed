Calvey said: \u201cThey just suddenly stopped \u00adtalking.\n\n(Image: Press Association)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cIt was really weird. Something \u00adhappened and then that was that, and it was like they never knew each other.\n\n\u201cAs fast as it happened, it ended.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was talk that \u00adbecause Rose was more famous than Myra it had put her nose out of joint.\u201d\n\nWest was sentenced to life in 1995 for helping her \u00addepraved husband Fred rape and murder ten youngsters at their home in Cromwell Street, Gloucester.\n\nFred West killed himself \u00adbefore trial,\n\nHindley was doing life for torturing and killing five children with her Moors Murderer lover Ian Brady in the 1960s. The case had made Hindley Britain\u2019s most \u00adnotorious female killer \u2013 but her infamy was rivalled by Rose\u2019s \u00adconviction over the House of Horror rapes and killings.\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\nWest and Hindley formed their bond after a chance encounter when West was remanded in custody at the category B prison, her \u00adformer solicitor says.\n\nThe revelations are published for the first time in a book on the murders she committed with her husband, a builder.\n\nMr Goatley represented Rose West for 12 years and visited her \u00adbehind bars dozens of times.\n\nIn Understanding Fred & Rose West, he wrote of her prison years: \u201cRose\u2019s first \u00adparamour was the Moors \u00admurderer Myra Hindley, who happened to be on the hospital wing at HMP Durham at the same time in 1995 and early 1996.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\u201cHindley was there because she had \u2018fallen over\u2019 in the exercise yard of F Wing.\n\n\u201cIt was prison policy that a new inmate who was a lifer would first be assessed on the prison wing.\n\n\u201cI recall that Rose was quite taken with Hindley, impressed by her \u00adknowledge and ability.\n\n\u201cRose said Hindley had studied \u00advarious Open University courses.\n\n\u2018She said, \u2018Yeah Myra, she\u2019s all right. We get on. I want to see how it goes.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr Goatley believes this \u201cwas \u00adreference to a flowering, albeit short-lived, lesbian relationship\u201d. But he tells how when he visited West a few months later her opinion had changed dramatically.\n\n(Image: Press Association)\n\nThe book says: \u201cShe was saying, \u2018You have to watch Hindley, mind. She is very manipulative.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t realise it, but she gets you doing stuff for her.\n\n\u201cOh, she\u2019s clever, all right. She\u2019s flipping dangerous, that one. She ain\u2019t going to take me for a c*** again\u2019. And so heralded the end of their romance.\u201d\n\nMr Goatley claims the affair with Hindley, who always denied any such relationship with West, was one of many female friendships West enjoyed from the start of her life sentence.\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\nHe added: \u201cThe friendships were genuinely supportive and often sexual. They could also be unstable and end in resentment.\u201d\n\nMr Goatley first represented West in 1992, when she was accused of \u00adaiding and abetting her husband in the sexual abuse of one of their children.\n\nHe continued to act for her until 2004, when he says it became clear she was making a life for herself in \u00adprison and no longer needed him. Now 65, she \u00adreportedly has her own cell on the special unit at New Hall prison in West Yorks, after she was shipped out of Low Newton in Co Durham earlier this year.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nIt comes amid health \u00adproblems as West has complained of struggling to climb stairs to her cell. Her eyesight is also said to be failing.\n\nHindley died aged 60 in 2002 after serving 36 years while Brady died in 2017, aged 79, after spending 51 years behind bars.\n\nCalvey says she finally got to know Hindley at Highpoint Prison in Suffolk, years after their stint in Durham, when she was asked to be her hairdresser.\n\nBut Calvey, who this year released book Black Widow about her life as an armed robber, said: \u201cShe mysteriously never spoke about Rose to me. It was like it \u00adnever happened. Clearly a sore point.\"", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Linda Calvey claims guards and lags at Durham Prison were aware evil child killers were more than just friends", "authors": ["Scarlet Howes", "Image", "Roland Leon Sunday Mirror", "Pa Archive Press Association Images", "Press Association", "Pa", "Pa Archive Pa Images", "Newcastle Chronicle", "Mirrorpix"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20651891.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Rosemary-West-collect-photo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
