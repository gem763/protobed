Duggan led TCU with 72 yards rushing.\n\nEhlinger\u2019s first three interceptions led to 13 TCU points, and coach Tom Herman gave the Horned Frogs three more when he called timeout just before freshman Griffin Kell missed a 52-yard field goal try on the final play of the first half. Kell drilled the second chance.\n\nThe Longhorns (5-3, 3-2) lost a third straight game in Fort Worth for the first time since the 1940s. It was the fifth win in six tries against Texas for the Horned Frogs, which includes their first four-game winning streak in the series since the 1930s.\n\nAfter Texas pulled within three with 6:50 remaining, Duggan converted two long third downs with completions, including a 36-yarder to Taye Barber with a defender right in his face to set up his 11-yard TD run.\n\nDuggan\u2019s first college interception in the first quarter ended a streak of 143 passes without one, the second-longest in TCU history behind Jeff Ballard (154 in 2006). But Ehlinger gave it right back with his first pick, which was TCU\u2019s first takeaway in four games.\n\nReagor easily ran past D\u2019Shawn Jamison for his longest completion of the season right after Ar\u2019Darius Washington cut off Jake Smith\u2019s path on a crossing route for the interception.\n\nTrevon Moehrig grabbed TCU\u2019s third interception at the Texas 36 on the last play of the third quarter, leading to Song\u2019s 33-yard field goal for a 30-20 lead.\n\nEhlinger threw for 321 yards and two touchdowns, and Devin Duvernay had a career-high 173 yards receiving.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nTexas: This might be the biggest soul-searching loss in Herman\u2019s three seasons, coming a week after the Longhorns avoided an embarrassing defeat with a field goal on the final play to beat Kansas 50-48. Texas didn\u2019t trail until Reagor\u2019s TD, and didn\u2019t do enough to respond after that.\n\nTCU: Duggan went a long way toward securing the starting job long-term. Before all the big plays he made late, Duggan escaped the grasp of Malcolm Roach in the end zone and ran for a first down on third-and-9 in the first half.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTexas: A week off, then Kansas State at home Nov. 9.\n\nTCU: At Oklahoma State next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "description": "FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) \u2014 Freshman Max Duggan threw two touchdown passes, including a tiebreaking 44-yarder to Jalen Reagor the first play after one of Sam", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/26/0ad50a_texas-tcu-football-19030-texas-quarterback-sam-ehlinger-11-throws-pass-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
