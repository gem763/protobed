South Africa belongs to us. We are ruling South Africa\".\n\nThe report states that the trial court found that the judge also uttered the following words at the scene of the incident:\n\nMotata: \"Yes, but you know all of you, let me tell you most of us this is our world, it is not the world of the boers. Even if they can have big bodies, South Africa is ours.\"\n\nWitness 1: \"But sir, the problems is you drove into his wall.\"\n\nMotata: \"Even if I can drive into it I will pay it. It is not a problem that I can pay for the wall but he must not criticise me. There is no boer who will criticise me, (indistinct) what he thinks.\"\n\nWitness 1: \"But Mr you of the law person.\"\n\nMotata: \"Yes, I am the man of the law, I am saying if I knocked his wall... (Intervenes).\n\nWitness 1: \"Do you know the law of.... (Intervenes).\n\nMotata: \"Yes I know the law. Let me go to the law. I do not care about him. Yes he must not look at me as a black man. Let me go before the law. That is how much I owe him for the wall which I broke down.\"\n\nWitness 1: \"But then it is not good to insult him.\"\n\nMotata: \"F**k him, f**k him, he must not insult me, I say f**k him. Anybody who insults me, I say f**k you.\"\n\nDefence 'inconsistent with the ethics of a judicial officer'\n\nThe tribunal also looked into a complaint on how Motata advanced his defence during the criminal trial.\n\nDuring his trial, Motata's legal team contended that the judge would testify that he was not under the influence of alcohol while driving his car and that the property owner was the one who was racist towards him.\n\nMotata claimed that he did not consider himself to be drunk at the time of the accident as he only had two glasses of wine that evening.\n\nAccording to Motata, he was provoked and angered by the property owner who is alleged to have called him a drunken k****r. The property owner is also alleged to have taken his car keys from him.\n\nThe tribunal noted that Motata made these allegations, yet he also insisted that the comments he made were not made to the homeowner and that he was speaking to the police officers on scene in Setswana.\n\nThe tribunal report further states that the way in which Motata led his defence during the criminal trial was inconsistent with the ethics of a judicial officer and was therefore tantamount to gross misconduct.\n\nMotata was found guilty in 2009 by the High Court in Pretoria of drunk driving and fined R20 000.", "description": "The Judicial Services Commission will meet to decide whether it will follow the recommendation of a judicial tribunal that retired Judge Nkola Motata be removed from office.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4659/d45757e721c544f996d229535e5f1376.jpg", "published_at": "2018-04-17"}
