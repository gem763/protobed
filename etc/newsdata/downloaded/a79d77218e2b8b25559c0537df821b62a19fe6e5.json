Email webnews@trinitymirror.com\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThe man was resting on a safety net outside the tower as police and contractors discussed if the net could hold his weight.\n\nSpecialist police climbers began their ascent up the tower at around 4.15pm.\n\nA spokesman for the group said the climber was a 43-year-old tree surgeon.\n\nAs he stood tens of metres above the street, Mr Atkinson posted on Facebook: \"Gone and done it... Extinction Rebellion. Here to stay.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\"We got the declaration of climate emergency last time. Now perhaps, please Boris, you're struggling to navigate Brexit let alone work our way out of the sixth mass extinction event.\n\n\"Please. Pretty please.... let's get on with the citizens assembly. Thank's Boris.\n\n\"I know somewhere in there you have compassionate feelings towards something other then your career. You've got Premiership.\n\n\"Now you've got a chance to do something that could last for centuries. A legacy of being the man that turned it all around. Dare you.\n\n\"Oh, and thanks Greta. I heard you calling.\"\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nAnother Extinction Rebellion protester said he had \"no idea\" that another activist was going to climb Big Ben.\n\n\"We all come from different circles but are all part of Extinction Rebellion,\" Harry, who did not want to give his last name, told the PA news agency.\n\n\"We don't want to bring down the system, we want to shake them enough to get some action.\"\n\nThe police began clearing people from the road beneath the tower shortly before 4pm.\n\nAt around 4pm police had cut through the netting around the scaffolding that separated them from the outer safety net where the man is.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nThey moved to put ropes around him the man in a bid to make sure he was safe.\n\nBetween pacing around the red safety net which drooped heavily under his weight, the man lay down with his blond wig trailing over the edge.\n\nTwo ambulances and two police vans arrived a few minutes after 4pm at the base of the tower inside Parliament, as emergency services planned their attempt to apprehend the climber.\n\nAt about 4.30pm the climber had moved from the net to a large metal girder, where he sat looking out at the capital.\n\nAt around 7pm the Mr Atkinson was removed from the tower.\n\nPolice officers used a lift attached to the scaffolding to bring the protester to the ground and at least six people were seen accompanying him to his descent.\n\nAs the lift reached the floor a group of supporters cheered from behind a fence surrounding the Palace of Westminster.\n\nSeveral emergency vehicles including two police vans and two police ambulances were waiting in the grounds of the palace.\n\nPedestrian and cycle access to the road near Big Ben was then reopened to the public.\n\n(Image: Adam Gray / SWNS)\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this afternoon hundreds of Extinction Rebellion protesters marched along Whitehall, past a heavy police presence at Downing Street ahead of a Cabinet meeting on Brexit.\n\nAccompanied by drums, large flags and followed by at least 14 police vans, the activists marched towards Trafalgar Square where other protesters had gathered.\n\nPolice have closed the entrance to Westminster Tube station that is across the road from the tower.\n\nThey are asking people to leave the area directly in front of where the demonstrator is.\n\nOther entrances to the Tube station remain open.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nA loud bang was heard by witnesses before the man appeared, although it is unclear if it was connected.\n\nA cordon was put in place at around 3pm while specialist officers investigated, but it has since been lifted.\n\nThe suspicious package, which is not thought to be connected to the protester, has been removed.\n\nA bomb disposal unit was at the scene and a police helicopter is flying overhead.\n\n\"Police have removed a suspicious package from Whitehall,\" Westminster police tweeted at 3.50pm.\n\n\"Specialist officers attended and made the package safe after they were informed at 15:01hrs.\n\n\"The cordon has now been lifted. Enquiries continue. The public are thanked for their patience.\"", "description": "Westminster Bridge and parts of Whitehall in central London have been closed by the emergency services, as an Extinction Rebellion protester climbs scaffolding", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Oliver Milne", "Milo Boyd", "Image", "Reuters", "Pa", "Daily Mirror", "Adam Gray", "Swns", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20649567.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
