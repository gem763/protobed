Odd lemur has evolved extra 'finger'", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - For a strange little lemur native to Madagascar that boasts one of the most unusual hands in the animal kingdom, a \u201chigh five\u201d is more like a \u201ctrick six.\u201d\n\nA primate called an aye-aye, which possess small \u201cpseudothumbs\u201d complete with their own fingerprints, is seen in this image released on October 22, 2019. David Haring/Duke Lemur Center/Handout via REUTERS.\n\nScientists have discovered that this nocturnal tree dweller, called an aye-aye, possesses an anatomical structure that serves as an extra thumb to go along with its five spindly fingers, an evolutionary innovation helpful for grasping small objects and branches.\n\nThis \u201cpseudothumb,\u201d as North Carolina State University biologist Adam Hartstone-Rose calls it, represents one of the few examples since the very first land-dwelling vertebrates appeared almost 400 million years ago of a creature acquiring through evolution the equivalent of an extra digit.\n\nIt is not an actual finger, but rather an evolutionary improvisation that builds on the wrist structure, with an augmented wrist bone accompanied by a cartilaginous extension, three muscles that move it and even a fingerprint. The pseudothumb is strong, able to exert an amount of force equal to almost half its total body weight.\n\n\u201cThe weirdest primate is even weirder than we knew,\u201d said Hartstone-Rose, who lead the research published this week in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology.\n\nThe giant panda also possesses a pseudothumb - with strikingly similar anatomy - that helps the bear with grasping bamboo.\n\nLemurs are among the most primitive members of the primate mammalian group that also includes monkeys, apes and humans.\n\nThe aye-aye is known for its huge bat-like ears, the largest relative brain size of any lemur, rodent-like ever-growing incisors - unique among primates - and strange hands. It has long fingers including its actual thumbs, and its middle fingers have a ball-and-socket joint like a person\u2019s shoulders - also unique among primates.\n\n\u201cThe animals are crazy looking and their hands are so spindly that they really look like a pile of twigs. I usually describe the aye-aye as looking more or less like a mangy cat walking on spiders,\u201d Hartstone-Rose said.\n\n\u201cTo some of us, aye-ayes are horrible looking. To others they are so ugly that they are cute. They sincerely look like something that Jim Henson created to bring an Edgar Allan Poe nightmare to life,\u201d Hartstone-Rose added, referring to the creator of \u201cThe Muppets\u201d and the macabre 19th century writer.\n\nThe aye-aye\u2019s fingers are not great for grasping - hence the need for a pseudothumb - but are perfect for its unusual \u201ctap foraging\u201d behavior. It taps on rotting wood with its middle finger and listens for voids. Using bat-like echolocation, it creates a mental map of the paths carved by grubs. It then uses its chisel-like incisors to cut holes in those tubes and uses its swiveling finger to get at the grubs.\n\nDigital reduction has been very common in evolution, as seen in dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex and hoofed mammals like horses. An improvised extra digit is extremely rare, with just a few examples. Cotton rats have a pseudothumb and certain moles and extinct marine reptiles called ichthyosaurs evolved different forms of an extra digit.", "description": "For a strange little lemur native to Madagascar that boasts one of the most unusual hands in the animal kingdom, a \"high five\" is more like a \"trick six.\"", "authors": ["Will Dunham", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444030879&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0JH-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
