For all the potshots by pundits and absurd power rankings, the players and coaches that are in the league know all the work that goes in to winning a ring and what that means for the players that remain on the team.\n\nFor Houston Rockets forward PJ Tucker, seeing the Raptors make a championship run served as a reminder of just how close he could have been to sharing a part in the success.\n\n\u201cWow. I was just there,\u201d he told Ryan Wolstat of the Toronto Sun. \u201cI was just there and I knew all those guys. All those guys worked really hard, good players, they deserved it.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nTucker did two tours of duty with the Raptors, he was a second-round draft pick of the team in 2003, and played 17 games three years later before being cut. He returned as a February trade acquisition for the 2017 playoff run, his first taste of the postseason. The Raptors made an effort to bring him back after that offseason, but he chose to sign with the Rockets.\n\nRaptors head coach Nick Nurse also has a tie to the Rockets organization, as he served as head coach of the team\u2019s D-League affiliate, the Rio Grande Valley Vipers. Nurse was on the bench from 2011-13, culminating \u2014 of course \u2014 in the 2013 D-League Championship.\n\n\u201cAny coach, I don\u2019t care how long he\u2019s been there, to win a championship is not easy. So kudos to him,\u201d Rockets head coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said of Nurse. \u201cBut you know Nick has been around, it\u2019s his first season as the head coach, but he was with them for six years so his learning curve was already good. Nick\u2019s a great coach and did a great job.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAs for the players tasked with running back the title, D\u2019Antoni isn\u2019t writing them off as quickly as some of the media ranks.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re one of the teams again, that even without Kawhi Leonard will be contending for a title,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cThey have a lot of players that can play.\u201d\n\nMore Toronto Raptors coverage from Yahoo Sports", "description": "P.J.
