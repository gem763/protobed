We fund them at the previous year\u2019s appropriation levels. Doesn\u2019t that make sense?\n\nThat common-sense approach should apply in Washington, but it doesn\u2019t. By the time I arrived in 2011, Congress\u2019s appropriations process was completely broken. The U.S. has since had three government shutdowns, passed 34 continuing resolutions to avoid shutdowns, raised or suspended the debt ceiling nine times, and increased the federal debt $8.5 trillion.\n\nThe debt ceiling is supposed to be a fiscal control that forces Congress to balance the budget or at least reduce annual deficits. That our federal government\u2019s gross debt stands at $22.6 trillion, and that this year\u2019s annual deficit is close to $1 trillion, proves it hasn\u2019t worked. Elected officials have become skilled at circumventing the debt ceiling and mortgaging our children\u2019s future with impunity.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, which I chair, passed a bill in June to force some fiscal discipline on Congress and end the cost and chaos of government shutdowns. There have been similar bills. Sens. Rob Portman and Mark Warner each introduced legislation earlier this year to fund the government automatically and avoid shutdowns. At least eight bills in the House seek to do the same. Some of these proposals decrease spending, while others would allow for more. None have passed because each party is suspicious that the other will exploit mandated spending discipline.\n\nSens. James Lankford and Maggie Hassan, a Republican from Oklahoma and a Democrat from New Hampshire, introduced a compromise measure that operates similarly to Wisconsin\u2019s law. If Congress can\u2019t pass an appropriations bill, their legislation would automatically appropriate funding for the affected parts of government at current levels. As an incentive, it prohibits members of Congress, their staffs and certain members of the administration from spending federal or campaign funds for travel until all the required appropriations bills pass. It also prevents both chambers of Congress from considering legislation other than appropriations bills except in rare cases of national emergency. Our committee added an amendment that would hold members\u2019 pay in escrow until all regular appropriations bills pass.\n\nWe might be surprised at how not getting paid, or having to pay for their own travel, would get members\u2019 attention. Despite the usual dysfunction and slow pace of the Senate, it\u2019s amazing how efficiently the body can function when a weekend or a recess is approaching and members are worried they might miss it.\n\nI moved the Lankford-Hassan bill through my committee because I thought it had the best chance of getting bipartisan support. I was right. The bill, as amended, passed the committee 12-2. The two no votes were Republican members who had competing bills.\n\nSkeptics who fear the bill could become the long-term funding mechanism for the federal government should look at Wisconsin\u2019s example. The longest period the provision has been in effect in Madison is four months\u2014and that was in 1971. It makes more sense to hold spending at previous levels for a short period than to incur the cost and chaos of recurring shutdowns.\n\nAnyone concerned that Congress would leave spending unchanged for the long term doesn\u2019t understand the pervasive bipartisan support for increased spending. Before this August\u2019s congressional recess, Congress worked out a budget deal that again suspended the debt ceiling (though July 2021) and raised spending by $320 billion over existing law in the next two fiscal years. The bill passed the Senate 67-28 and the House 284-149. A majority of nearly two-thirds in each chamber had no trouble simply suspending the debt ceiling and locking in annual deficits of about $1 trillion each year.\n\nMembers voting for the August budget deal and debt suspension felt the agreement would remove the threat of a government shutdown heading into the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. Yet last week the Senate could not muster the votes to advance a bill appropriating defense funds, and Senate leaders are now talking about passing a 35th continuing resolution to get us to November. The dysfunction continues.\n\nI\u2019m convinced, based on the discussion and votes in my committee, that the Prevent Government Shutdown Act of 2019 can pass with broad bipartisan support. Congress should vote on it before the end of the fiscal year. It\u2019s the least we can do to reduce Washington\u2019s pervasive dysfunction.\n\nMr. Johnson, a Republican, is a U.S. senator from Wisconsin.", "description": "Congress\u2019s budget process is broken.
