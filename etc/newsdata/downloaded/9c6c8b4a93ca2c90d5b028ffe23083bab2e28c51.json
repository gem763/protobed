A new study out Thursday seems to show that in both mice and humans, bones secrete a hormone in reaction to stressful situations. What\u2019s more, this bone hormone seems crucial to our fight-or-flight response, in a way completely separate from other well-known stress chemicals like adrenaline.\n\nGerard Karsenty, a geneticist at Columbia University, and his colleagues have long been interested in studying how our skeleton keeps us alive and healthy \u2014 not just by supporting us physically, but through the interactions it has with the rest of the body. Their work has centred on osteocalcin, a hormone produced by some of the same cells that make up bone.\n\nHis and others\u2019 earlier research has suggested that osteocalcin helps regulate diverse functions such as metabolism, muscle function during exercise, and fertility.\n\n\u201cWhat we found is that you do not necessarily need an ounce of the adrenal glands to produce this acute stress response, at least in mice.\u201d\n\nIn this sense, osteocalcin works like a lot like other hormones produced by the glands and organs that make up our endocrine system.\n\nBecause of this, Karsenty and his team have argued that the skeleton should be considered an endocrine organ. That line of thinking led Karsenty\u2019s team to theorise that our skeletons could have evolved to help us better respond to stress, too, since that\u2019s another pivotal function of the endocrine system. And if that\u2019s the case, then osteocalcin should play a leading role there as well.\n\nTo test this theory, they first experimented with mice. They exposed the poor rodents to various sources of acute stress, such as by restraining them or having them sniff the urine of foxes, a common predator. Judging by their blood tests, the team found that stressed-out mice produced more osteocalcin within minutes of their ordeal.\n\nThey then moved on to people. But since fox urine doesn\u2019t have quite the same effect on us, Karsenty instead asked volunteers to do some public speaking and then take questions. As expected, people\u2019s blood pressure and heart rate went up, as did their levels of osteocalcin.\n\nThe team\u2019s findings were published Thursday in Cell Metabolism.\n\nOther genetic experiments in mice suggested that osteocalcin directly affects a part of the brain called the amygdala, a region well known for helping us process emotions like fear. But importantly, this pathway from our bones to our brains doesn\u2019t seem to involve the adrenal glands \u2014 the organ located on top of our kidneys, long seen as the key to the fight-or-flight response.\n\nIt might even turn out that osteocalcin is more important to lighting a fire under us in the face of danger than our adrenal glands are. In mice bred to be unable to respond to osteocalcin, their fight-or-flight response was drastically muted, but the same wasn\u2019t true when mice lacked their adrenal glands. These mice were still capable of feeling quickly stressed out.\n\n\u201cWhat we found is that you do not necessarily need an ounce of the adrenal glands to produce this acute stress response, at least in mice,\u201d Karsenty said. \u201cAnd this may explain why even people without adrenaline can still have an intact response.\u201d\n\nIn Karsenty\u2019s theory, adrenaline and other hormones aren\u2019t worthless to our fight-or-flight response. For one, some of our nerve cells produce adrenaline and a related hormone called norepinephrine, too.\n\nHis team thinks that the production of osteocalcin triggers the release of these hormones in the brain, which then regulate other aspects of our acute stress response. Our adrenal glands are probably still playing their own role, even if they\u2019re not the starting gun that sends us going when we spot a tiger in the grass or a spider on the wall.\n\nThere\u2019s still a lot of work to be done before we can rewrite the book on stress and adrenaline, though. That\u2019ll involve further experiments with other test animals as well as people. But if nothing else, this is the latest bit of research to show that the body is even more complicated and interconnected than we have assumed it to be.\n\n\u201cWe have not been studying the body as long as people think. We have been studying groups of cells, isolated from one another,\u201d Karsenty said. \u201cBut what mouse genetics now allow is for us to look at the function of organs, and how hormones and molecules mediate their function, in an entire complex organism.\u201d", "description": "Anyone who\u2019s ever said they felt scared to their bones might have been speaking more literally than we knew.
