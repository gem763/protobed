My toes get stiff and tense and I put lots of pressure on the insole, often making a hole in it,' she said.\n\n'They get hot and uncomfortable.

'These are not only the obvious physical barriers like the one you can see in my photograph; having to peep through the railings to see the animals because I can\u2019t just get out of my wheelchair and stand up to see inside; but emotional and social barriers too.\n\n'Social isolation is a huge problem for young people with health needs. We are excluded from so many things, activities, parties and gatherings; just like the lonely lion in my photo, looking out at the rest of the beautiful, colourful and exciting world but not quite able to be part of it. This is so saddening and frustrating.\n\n'Can you imagine how it feels to have all your friends go out but you don\u2019t even get invited as there are no drop kerbs, steps to get inside or accessible changing facilities?\n\n'Accessibility is something I\u2019m extremely passionate about, I believe everywhere should be made wheelchair accessible. How is it fair that there\u2019s so much beauty in our world, but only certain people can get to see it?'\n\nThis picture of a solitary lion, taken through bars by Myles, 20, from Nottingham, who has to use a wheelchair, was also shortlisted. Myles said that social isolation, 'like the lonely lion in the photo', is a huge challenge for disabled young people\n\nME AND THE MINER\n\nNoah, 8, from Huddersfield, who is disabled, sent in a photograph of him preparing to descend a pit at the National Coal Mining Museum.\n\nHis mother said: 'Stepping out of the 'cage' down the pit after descending to 140metres, surrounded by coal and with just a head torch for light, I realised how far I had come as a parent who may potentially need to perform life saving action in these surroundings.\n\n'An ambulance would not be able to access us at all down there however I had all the emergency equipment and had been trained to the highest standard and I also had an excited son who wanted to do what all the other kids did, and so I felt confident to carry on and enjoy our day.'\n\nNoah, 8, from Huddersfield, sent in this image of him preparing to descend into a coalpit at the National Coal Mining Museum. His mother said that she went down with emergency equipment and medication so that she would be able to help her son if it was needed while they were exploring the mine\n\nOUT OF DARKNESS\n\nDylan, 12, from Merseyside submitted a photo of a butterfly to represent the fact that everyone has potential for beauty.\n\n'I am 12 years old and have Cerebral Palsy, cortical blindness, global development delay, epilepsy and scoliosis to name a few of my conditions. But I am Dylan,' he said.\n\n'Mummy helped me hold the camera and I pressed the button because butterflies grow in the darkness from a caterpillar into a beautiful butterfly.\n\n'When you have lots of friends with medical conditions the sad thing is unlike healthy children everyday life means my friends sometimes die, I also had a baby foster brother who was a poorly baby who died at a few months old.\n\n'This last couple of weeks some children we know grew their wings. But mummy tells me like the butterfly we all have dark times but we are all beautiful like the butterfly and will fly high and proud.'", "description": "Jack Kirsopp, 13, from Doncaster won the photo competition run by the charity WellChild, judged by contemporary artists including  Tracey Emin, Antony Gormley, Rankin and Anish Kapoor.", "authors": ["Luke Andrews For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/15/20284914-0-image-a-38_1572276062502.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
