Trump, according to reporting from The Post and the Wall Street Journal, repeatedly pressed President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was inaugurated in May, to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nBiden, of course, leads the field in the Democratic primary to face Trump in next year\u2019s general election. The investigation Trump wanted to see was meant to focus on Biden\u2019s push in late 2015 to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor who\u2019d earned the ire of U.S. and international officials for turning a blind eye to corruption. Trump and his allies claim without evidence that Biden advocated for the prosecutor\u2019s firing because the prosecutor may have been investigating a company on whose board Hunter Biden sat.\n\nShortly after Trump put that pressure on the Ukrainian president, his administration halted military aid to Ukraine that had been approved by Congress, only proceeding with that aid after a whistleblower within the intelligence community filed a complaint apparently focused on Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nIn short, then, Trump may have tried to leverage congressionally sanctioned aid to boost his own reelection chances \u2014 or, at least, he reportedly leveraged his position as president to push a foreign nation to aid his reelection campaign.\n\nIn short order, Trump\u2019s allies \u2014 by now well experienced in waving away concerns about his presidency \u2014 moved into action. In a series of appearances on television and radio, they identified the real wrongdoing in the situation, blaming a diaspora of people and organizations in an effort to downplay or erase questions about Trump.\n\nJoe Biden is the real wrongdoer\n\nBiden has been the most common target of Trump\u2019s defenders and of Trump himself.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to turn what was a Biden scandal into a Trump scandal.\u201d @PeterSchweizer The problem is, \u201cTrump\u201d did nothing wrong! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 21, 2019\n\nThe way those defenses are offered, though, varies.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared on CBS News\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Pompeo, a stalwart defender of his boss, suggested that the situation was indeed not complicated: Biden did something wrong.\n\n\u201cIf there was election interference that took place by the vice president, I think the American people deserve to know,\u201d Pompeo said, referring to Biden \u2014 and echoing the questions that have lingered around Trump\u2019s 2016 victory since before his presidency began. \u201cWe know there was interference in the 2016 election and if it\u2019s the case that there was something going on with the President or his family that caused a conflict of interest and Vice President Biden behaved in a way that was inconsistent with the way leaders ought to operate, I think the American people deserve to know that.\u201d\n\nAxios noted how Trump\u2019s most fervent media defender, Fox News, positioned the story Sunday, compared with MSNBC. MSNBC noted how Trump was trying to shift questions onto Biden \u2014 and Fox embraced that precise shift.\n\n\n\n(Screenshots of MSNBC, Fox News, via Axios)\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting the particularly sloppy defense that Fox News chose to highlight. It was an interview with Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee. The suggestion Nunes made wasn\u2019t only that Biden was culpable but, indeed, that he was already paying a political cost for being so deeply mired in this controversy.\n\n\u201cThese stories first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure Biden didn\u2019t get in the race,\u201d Nunes said. \u201cSo now that these have been resurrected, it sure looks like the scheme has backfired. And, like I said, it looks like this is the end of Biden\u2019s campaign. I really do... his lead is basically down to zero.\u201d\n\nThe allegation that Biden did something wrong in December 2015 didn\u2019t originate with an effort by Hillary Clinton to keep Biden out of the race, given that he announced he wasn\u2019t running that year in October 2015. What\u2019s more, Nunes\u2019s claim that Biden\u2019s lead was \u201cdown to zero\u201d was apparently based on a new poll in Iowa where Biden is running even with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\n\nThat poll was conducted before the Ukraine story emerged in the news.\n\nThe problem with this theory? The central problem with the Biden-did-wrong theory is a dearth of evidence that Biden did anything wrong. While it\u2019s easy to see how Biden\u2019s demands about the Ukrainian prosecutor could be spun as an effort to aid his son, there has been no evidence to emerge that Hunter Biden\u2019s role was the motivation for that firing, that Biden acted alone in making the demand, that he knew of an investigation or that an investigation into the company even existed. Instead of rewriting our Fact Checkers\u2019 analysis of the situation, we\u2019ll instead just point you to that article.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll note that advocating for a prosecutor who is more likely to fight hard on corruption would seem like a weird choice.\n\nHunter Biden is the real wrongdoer\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin marched boldly into a minefield while talking to CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWhat I do find inappropriate is the fact that Vice President Biden at the time\u2019s son did very significant business dealings in Ukraine,\u201d Mnuchin said of the controversy. \u201cI, for one, find that to be concerning. And, to me, that is the issue perhaps that should be further investigated.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Tapper replied. \u201cSo it is okay for Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump Jr. to do business all over the world, it\u2019s okay for Ivanka Trump to have copyrights approved all over the world while President Trump is president, but while Vice President Joe Biden was vice president, his son shouldn\u2019t have been able to do business dealings?\u201d\n\nMnuchin stumbled.\n\n\u201cAgain, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t really want to go into more of these details,\u201d he said, \u201cother than to say \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re just setting a precedent that the president is violating,\u201d Tapper replied.\n\n\u201cAgain, I think there is a significant difference in what you\u2019re saying, okay, or what I was saying between Biden and his son\u2019s relationship with the Ukraine oligarch,\u201d Mnuchin said, \u201cand potential business dealings that the Trump Organization has had which predated his presidency.\u201d\n\nThat can be a subtle distinction. In August, for example, Donald Trump Jr. traveled to Indonesia to tout a resurrected resort there. It was in the works before Trump\u2019s presidency, but at least one ethics group questions the extent to which it stretches Trump\u2019s pledge that the Trump Organization would not to engage in new international deals during his presidency.\n\nTrump Jr., meanwhile, expressed his own support for the idea that Hunter Biden had acted inappropriately, favoriting a tweet criticizing Hunter Biden\u2019s having apparently profited from his father\u2019s name.\n\nThe problem with this theory? While it\u2019s certainly fair to question the appropriateness of a vice president\u2019s child partnering with a foreign company, there is also some hypocrisy to those criticisms in this case. And, as above, there\u2019s no evidence that Hunter Biden\u2019s role prompted Biden\u2019s demands.\n\nUkraine is the real wrongdoer\n\nTrump and his allies have repeatedly pointed to Ukraine and Ukrainian politics to defend Trump since he took office. As questions arose about the 2016 Trump campaign\u2019s interactions with Russian actors, Trump\u2019s team tried to gin up a countervailing theory that Ukraine was working to boost Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Monday, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) suggested that Ukraine\u2019s role broadly should earn scrutiny.\n\n\u201cAll things Trump have been looked at regarding Russia. Now it\u2019s time for all things Ukraine to be looked at,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI like Joe Biden. I\u2019ve been a friend of his for a very long time. But we can\u2019t have two standards here. The prosecutor was looking at things in the Ukraine, and he got fired, and there\u2019s all kind of allegations about the Ukraine dumping information into the legal system and political system in 2016 about Manafort and others, you know, Hunter Biden, what kind of situation did he have financially? I\u2019m hoping somebody will take a look at all things Ukraine like they did with Russia from the Department of Justice.\u201d\n\nThe problem with this theory? The theories about Ukraine trying to influence U.S. politics or the 2016 election have consistently been shown to lack merit.\n\nThe theory that Ukraine was \u201cdumping information\u201d in 2016 centers on two incidents. In one, a contractor with the Democratic National Committee sought help from people at the Ukrainian Embassy in digging into then-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort\u2019s work in that country. In the other, evidence that Manafort had received secret payments from a pro-Russian political party was released by a Ukrainian organization in August 2016, leading to his ouster from the campaign.\n\nIn neither case is there evidence of a top-down effort on the part of Ukraine to aid Clinton. Both center on efforts to uncover information on Manafort, whose payments for his work for Ukraine led to convictions for money laundering and fraud. He is now in prison.\n\nThe whistleblower is the real wrongdoer\n\nThis story came to national attention after the Trump administration sought to prevent Congress from seeing the original complaint from a whistleblower inside the intelligence community. Mirroring months of attacks on the FBI agents who\u2019d probed the Trump campaign\u2019s interactions with Russia, Trump allies cast the whistleblower as a \u201cdeep state\u201d \u201cspy\u201d who had behaved dishonorably in bringing the story to light.\n\nGregg Jarrett: \"He appears to be an American spy spying on the president, listening in on conversations.\" pic.twitter.com/nYOdLeHdna \u2014 Matthew Gertz (@MattGertz) September 23, 2019\n\nOn Fox News last week, while acknowledging that he didn\u2019t have broad context for what the whistleblower\u2019s allegation was, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) declared that the situation looked like \u201canother Deep State attack.\u201d Speaking to Fox News\u2019s Bret Baier on Friday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) insisted that all of the facts weren\u2019t out, but that this appeared to be part of a pattern of someone \u201cselectively put[ting] something out\u201d to try to undermine the results of the 2016 election.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), one of Trump\u2019s most energetic defenders, told reporters that there are \u201cpeople in the intelligence community and other parts of the government who just have it out for the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any worries about the president,\u201d he added.\n\nThe problem with this theory? Even if the whistleblower were Hillary Clinton herself, it wouldn\u2019t change the content of the conversation Trump had with Zelensky.\n\nThe media is the real wrongdoer\n\nAt an event in Texas over the weekend, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) identified his own culprit in the situation: reporters covering the story.\n\n\u201cI am a little troubled that apparently some of the initial reports came from somebody who didn\u2019t have firsthand knowledge, and then it sort of took off like a wildfire,\u201d Cornyn said of the story. \u201cLot of speculation. I\u2019d prefer to wait until we get the access to the real information to make a judgment.\u201d\n\nOf course, the problem with that is that Congress was blocked from getting the whistleblower\u2019s report in the first place. That\u2019s what prompted House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) to subpoena the document.\n\nCornyn is not alone. In his interview with Hewitt, Graham suggested that the Ukraine story \u201cmakes the [Justice Brett] Kavanaugh story look like good journalism\u201d \u2014 a reference to assertions from conservatives that the New York Times\u2019s article about accusations against Kavanaugh was fatally flawed.\n\nTrump shared a clip from Fox News in which Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) blames the media for the story, suggesting that it was simply part of the same complaints about Trump that have existed since he took office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exactly the kind of thing they\u2019ve been accusing Trump of all along,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cCan you imagine if the prosecutor in Ukraine, if his name was \u2018Bob Mueller,\u2019 what would have happened?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what that means.\n\nThe problem with this theory? The simplest way to undermine the media\u2019s reporting as incorrect or overly eager is to release the whistleblower complaint and the transcript of the Zelensky call so that the reporting can be contrasted with reality. So far, the administration hasn\u2019t done so.\n\nThere was no wrongdoing at all!\n\nThis is the angle taken by Trump.\n\nOn Sunday, he claimed that the call with Zelensky was a \u201cbeautiful, warm, nice conversation\u201d in which he didn\u2019t pressure Zelensky at all. He later tweeted \u201cbreaking news\u201d to that effect, spinning things back to Biden once again.\n\nThe problem with this theory? The American public is being asked to decide whom to believe, Trump or press reports. Trump\u2019s assertion that nothing untoward happened depends, for now, on taking his word over that of the media and our sources.\n\nThat\u2019s a big gamble for Trump.", "description": "A look at how Trump's team is spinning the new controversy.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/F8fpj89mzoDszsrd_B7unXj5qfU=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-23-2019/t_e12cd44d5f21407e962fe6613bb8ae7c_name_20190923_GOP_UKRAINE_V2.png"}
