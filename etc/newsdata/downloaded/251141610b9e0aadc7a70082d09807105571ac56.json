But critics immediately insisted that pulling U.S. troops from the area would give the Turks a green light to flood into areas controlled by the Kurds to wipe them out.\n\nThe president insisted that \u201cit is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home.\u201d\n\nTrump continued saying, \u201cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!).\u201d\n\nStill the president delivered a veiled warning that Turkey would be responsible for watching over captured ISIS fighters.\n\nArquette, not exactly a noted foreign affairs scholar, doesn\u2019t hold back her hate for President Trump.\n\nIn March, Arquette said President Trump is perpetuating a \u201csick dictatorship\u201d and running \u201ca government that has normalized racism rape, mass killings from Guns Pedophilia, homophobia.\u201d\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Activist actress Rosanna Arquette excoriated President Donald Trump on Twitter after Trump spoke about his desires to bring U.S. troops home.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/RosannaArquettekurd1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
