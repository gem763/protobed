Devin Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said he\u2019s \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the \u201ctech oligarchs\u201d and the influence these left-leaning social media execs will have on the upcoming election \u2014 on the whole state and fate of free speech, of conservative speech.\n\nAnd how right he is.\n\nAmerica is a free-market system, and the government should not step in and control companies operated in the manner of free markets. But Twitter, Facebook, Google \u2014 these companies have gone beyond the confines of their content moderation platforms, well into the field of content and news creation.\n\nRegulation is inevitable.\n\nBut with Democrats in charge of the House, and with social media favoring Democrats, it\u2019s going to be later, rather than sooner, that regulation comes.\n\n\u201cCongress has actually carved out a special provision in law for them because they were supposed to be an open square \u2014 an open public square,\u201d Nunes said in an exclusive interview with Breitbart. \u201cThey\u2019re the internet. So they\u2019re not treated like someone, say, some other kind of product would be treated, like a car, for example, or a kitchen appliance. They\u2019ve had this special carveout for 20 years.\u201d\n\nAnd then the censorship began.\n\nThen the stifling of free thought started.\n\nThen the crackdown on conservatives commenced.\n\nOne of the latest? Lila Rose\u2019s anti-abortion Live Action group, which has the \u201clargest and most engaged online following in the pro-life movement,\u201d as Newsweek described it, was booted from Pinterest after one employee labeled the organization a pornography site. That led to Live Action\u2019s automatic block. Live Action was also prevented on Twitter from running advertisements \u2014 paid advertisements. And Live Action was also swept into Google\u2019s reconfiguring of \u201chealth care\u201d topics so that searches on \u201cabortion\u201d wouldn\u2019t bring up Rose\u2019s group.\n\nYet these same social media sites insist they\u2019re politically neutral. Still. To this day.\n\nGovernment regulation is the most talked-about idea. But oh what a web that would weave.\n\nConservatives, after all, aren\u2019t supposed to be in the business of regulating free markets.\n\nBetter would be this: Amend Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 so that it adds \u201cpolitical beliefs\u201d or \u201cpolitical ideology\u201d to the list \u2014 so that the law would prevent employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of \u201csex, race, color, national origin and religion\u201d and political beliefs.\n\nNot only would that lead to more conservatives actually working at these social media outlets \u2014 balancing out the business, balancing out the business of censoring \u2014 but it would also cast a black shadow over political censorship.\n\nIt would stick a stigma onto political censorship, and soon enough, after a court challenge or two \u2014 after a conservative Google employee, say, sued for discriminatory treatment by fellow liberal Google employees, or by a liberal Google boss \u2014 these social media companies would learn to control their anti-conservative impulses.\n\nSoon enough, the public would learn that condemning conservative ideas on social media is a no-no.\n\nWhat\u2019s better about this approach is that it\u2019s not a government crackdown on free speech. It\u2019s not government censorship.\n\nIt\u2019s free-market persuasion based on law, and it lets conservatives have their social media cake without having to eat their capitalist principles.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
