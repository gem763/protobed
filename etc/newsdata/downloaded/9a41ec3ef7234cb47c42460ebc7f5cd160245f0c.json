Cooper goes to the bathroom to brush his teeth. He starts to grin, squeezes the toothpaste into the sink, rears his head back and head butts the mirror. In between the cracks in the mirror, Bob\u2019s face is staring back at him.\n\nI\u2019ve watched it eight times and I still feel queasy\n\nThe West Wing, picked by NonOxbridgeColumnist\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The West Wing. Photograph: PR\n\nIt has to be the season one finale of The West Wing, leading up to the assassination attempt \u2013 and it\u2019s two cliffhangers in one episode. The cold opening (six and a half minutes by itself) takes you up to: \u201cI saw something ...\u201d and then you spend 30 minutes or so watching the previous 24 hours before lurching back to the present. Those last five minutes, with foreknowledge of something, seeing things you\u2019ve already watched from a different angle (most wonderfully Sam\u2019s smile at Toby after the \u201ctake-off\u201d sign, which brings me to the verge of tears just writing about it), are stomach-churningly tense. I\u2019ve watched it eight times and I still feel queasy. It\u2019s absolutely masterful writing.\n\nWhen Jack Bauer went too far\n\n24, picked by StanleyGoodspeed\n\nThe best ending of a 24 episode was when Jack Bauer had to execute his annoying but totally innocent and good-guy-in-the-end boss Ryan Shapiro in a scrapyard on the orders of the series villain, otherwise he would release a bio weapon. I kept thinking something or someone would save the day, or it was just a test to see how far Bauer would go. But it happened and the episode ended with a blank screen and no end credit music.\n\nThe Doctor stranded with hungry cannibals banging at the door!\n\nDoctor Who, picked by chriskilby\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Doctor Who. Photograph: Adrian Rogers/BBC\n\nThe Master, nicking the Doctor\u2019s Tardis and stranding him at the end of the universe with hungry cannibals banging at the door in Utopia, still takes some beating.

Photograph: The Sci-Fi Channel/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar\n\nBattlestar Galactica (the new one) when the battered fleet jubilantly arrives at Earth. Adama announces to the survivors that their journey is finally over. A party travel down to the surface, landing in the ruins of a large city. They are left speechless when they find Earth to be a desolate, radioactive, lifeless world, destroyed by nuclear conflict thousands of years previously.\n\nYou knew someone was getting beaten to death \u2026\n\nThe Walking Dead, picked by mattblack81\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Walking Dead. Photograph: Gene Page/AMC\n\nThe Walking Dead where Negan had them on their knees. You knew someone was getting beaten to death but you had to wait months to find out who. Because of the comics, there was lots of speculation but even when you think you knew, there was another twist.\n\n\u2018When Saga realises Martin killed Jens\u2019\n\nThe Bridge, picked by Literally\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Bridge. Photograph: Jens Juncker/BBC/Filmlance International AB Nimbus Film\n\nI liked the second series of The Bridge. When Saga realises Martin killed Jens, we expected this would be the time for her to realise how much she likes Martin and understands his reasons \u2026 but she arrests him.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s Life milked it for an age\u2019\n\nDallas, picked by GonePhishing\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Larry Hagman as JR Ewing in Dallas. Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/Getty Images\n\nThe JR thing was massive\u2019 it even spawned T-shirts with \u201cI Shot JR\u201d on them. Esther Rantzen and the That\u2019s Life! crew milked it for an age, doing weekly trawls of high streets in search of grannies\u2019 opinions. But it was at a time when there was very little TV choice. We had two and a half channels and not 24/7. Most telly finished at about midnight and didn\u2019t kick off again until about 9am, 11am at the earliest in BBC Two\u2019s case. The BBC drama budget was about \u00a35 an episode, so anything from the States was considered huge.\n\n\u2018A very tense weekend in our household\u2019\n\nBlockbusters, picked by Diagost\n\nA 1985 edition of Blockbusters \u2013 we were left on a Friday tea time cliff edge after time had run out and it was flashing for both white and blue hexagons in a deciding game.
