While slamming China for what he called unfair trade practices, Trump appeared to downplay the importance of quickly striking a deal.\n\n\"Hopefully we can reach an agreement that will be beneficial for both countries. But as I have made very clear I will not accept a bad deal for the American people,\" Trump said, prompting no reaction from the Chinese delegation watching.\n\nMajor U.S. stock indexes popped earlier Tuesday amid new optimism about the U.S. and China ending an economic conflict that has led to tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in goods. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he expected high-level trade talks with Beijing to resume in two weeks.", "description": "Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Trump strikes an optimistic tone about reaching a trade deal with China.", "authors": ["Amanda Macias Jacob Pramuk", "Amanda Macias", "Jacob Pramuk"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106146153-1569335058720gettyimages-1170717488.jpeg?v=1569335799", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
