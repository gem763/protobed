That is the question of the day. Iran is the strongly suspected perpetrator of weekend drone and missile attacks against key Saudi oil infrastructure at Abqaiq facility and Khurais oil field that temporarily cut the kingdom's oil production by almost half.\n\nApparently, some 20 drones and several cruise missiles hit a total of at least 17 different aim points at these two general locations in the country's east. The weapons may have been launched either from Iranian soil or a place fairly close by.\n\nBut this is actually a tougher question than it might first appear. For some, retaliation is a no brainer, especially once forensics analysis confirms what is already widely assumed \u2014 that Iran either carried out these attacks itself or had a proxy do so. (The fact that the drones or missiles made their final approach from the north does not really prove anything about their launch point, since such vehicles have motors and can fly virtually any flight path they wish. Also, because they are not ballistic missiles with bright booster rockets, their launch points probably cannot be discerned from satellite imagery. We will probably need to inspect the wreckage of the missiles to understand their origin.)\n\nWhat they may be capable of: Iran's struggling space program could be a real threat if it ever gets off the ground.\n\nBut before racing to a response, on the assumption that honor and principle require a military response to Iran's aggression, it is worth remembering several other considerations:\n\nNegligible effect on the market\n\n\u25ba Although the attack was rather egregious, global oil markets have tolerated it well. About five million barrels a day of production was affected for a few days; going forward, production will be reduced by perhaps a couple million barrels a day for some additional time to come. But Saudi Arabia had several hundred million barrels of oil in storage; other countries around the world have several billion.\n\nOil prices will stabilize\n\n\u25ba Oil prices spiked after the attack but will likely come back down now that production is being restored. Even at peak, they were in the reasonable range of $70 a barrel (that figure is actually better than the prevailing level of $50 a barrel for many American shale oil producers \u2014 though I won't push this point too far about higher oil prices somehow being good!).\n\nThese sanctions are hurting Iran\n\n\u25ba In the big picture, Iran's various attacks show its weaknesses and highlight the pressure it is under. That is because of the Trump administration's decision last year to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions, its decision this year to aim for zero oil exports by Iran, and its willingness to use \"secondary sanctions\" to get other countries and companies to desist from doing business with Iran (forcing them, in effect, to choose between doing business with America and doing business with the Islamic Republic). Yes, Iran finds ways to circumvent some sanctions, but its overall exports are down by 75% or more. The economy is now in recession.\n\nWe have to be above it\n\n\u25ba A semi-dictatorship like Iran's theocratic state can tolerate a certain amount of such misery, and suppress public dissent \u2014 but it cannot be entirely oblivious to the gradual weakening of its economy. The key thing, for the United States and partners, is to maintain the moral high ground (or as much of it as we can realistically hold in this situation) so that other countries do not feel the desire to help Iran skirt the sanctions regime. Over time, Iran will continue to feel the heat \u2014 and we may have an opportunity to negotiate a better deal than the Obama administration was able to obtain (though the Trump administration should not boast too much about its accomplishments until it has in fact achieved such an outcome).\n\nAlso, it is worth keeping mind the limitations of military force. While no fan of Mr. Trump's foreign policy overall, I will give the president credit for his intuitive understanding of that basic fact. We certainly do not want to wind up in all-out war with a country more than twice the population of Iraq or Afghanistan. Even a sustained aerial attack against its nuclear-related infrastructure would have serious downsides. Yes, it would set back Iran's theoretical potential to produce a nuclear bomb \u2014 but at present, international inspectors are still in Iran confirming that it is not building a bomb (that's because the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action remains in effect, even after the U.S. withdrawal and some subsequent limited Iranian violations of the deal's terms).", "description": "Iran's attack reveals weakness.
