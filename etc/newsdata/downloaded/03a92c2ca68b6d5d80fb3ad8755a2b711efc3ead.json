They didn\u2019t even realize the picture had been taken until two years later, when Marc Jacobs slid into their DMs to ask if they could be in his upcoming campaign. Someone at the brand had seen Scott\u2019s photo. The twins went on to star in the ads. But Erin and Alyssa aren\u2019t professional models. They live in Michigan and work at a sports company. Had they considered modeling before? \u201cNo, never. I\u2019d rather be playing a sport,\u201d said Alyssa.
