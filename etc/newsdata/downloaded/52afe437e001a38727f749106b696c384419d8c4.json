They didn't manage to put in a valid claim in time to collect, and the cash was passed straight to the Good Causes fund instead.\n\nSo, in the wake of the country's biggest ever win, at just north of \u00a3170million, we've taken a look at how you go from seeing your numbers come up in the draw to the jackpot arriving in your bank account.\n\nBut by far the most important point is the cut-off date.\n\nAndy Carter, senior winners' advisor at The National Lottery, said: \"Players all across the country are urged to check their tickets as soon as possible.\"\n\nYou have a total of 180 days from the date of the draw to claim EuroMillions prizes in the UK, although most people claim within the first few days or weeks of finding out that they\u2019ve won.\n\nIn fact, you can even claim if you've lost your ticket - as long as you contact the National Lottery inside 30 days and pass the security checks needed to prove it was you who won.\n\nTo start the claims process, you need to call the National Lottery Customer Care Team on 0333 234 44 33 if you played online, or 0333 234 50 50 if you played in-store.\n\nThe claims team asks some questions about you and the ticket, then confirms on the phone if the details you have provided are right and you're in line for a massive payoff.\n\nThe next step is to meet National Lottery advisors in person - something that's necessary for all winning over \u00a350,000.\n\nThe meeting can be at home or at one of the lottery\u2019s regional centres.\n\nThe lottery reckons the meeting takes about two hours, while you do things like prove your identity fill out paperwork and ask questions.\n\nThey normally recommend you open a private bank account to get the money sent to \u2013 to help protect your privacy and because banks offering this sort of account have teams who deal specifically with lottery winners.\n\nAfter that, the money will be transferred within 48 hours and is yours to spend on as many supercars as you like.\n\nDo you have to go public?\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe lottery\u2019s advisors stick around after the money reaches you, whether you choose to go public or not.\n\nBut one of the questions you get asked during the validation meeting is how many people you have already told.\n\nIf you decide to go public, you have to complete some media obligations, such as a winner\u2019s ceremony where your name will be released to newspapers and TV stations and you will be asked questions about your life and plans for the money.\n\nWhat next\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nYour support doesn't stop there, with the National Lottery setting up a follow-up meeting a few weeks after you have been paid.\n\nThis will include some lawyers and financial advisors to make sure everything has gone smoothly and to ensure that there are no loose ends.\n\nYou also get the chance to meet other big winners, to ask questions or get some support from people who have already gone through the processs.\n\nAfter that, the National Lottery will be available to offer advice for as long as you want it, but will emphasise it's up to you to do whatever you want with your money.", "description": "If things go wrong you could lose all of your Euromillions jackpot - and the worrying fact is, that has happened after a draw before", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Pa", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14161978.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_SWNS_LOTTO_WINNER_01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
