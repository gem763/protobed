I'm overcome by how we just stunk it up early here tonight as a football team. And that far overshadows any specific things on a long-term basis. You could not have a future around here and done better than what we did out there tonight. We just got to play better. I haven't even glanced there in my mind about long-term future. I'm looking at [the] future as next week against those Eagles.\"\n\nWhile Jones wasn't happy with Garrett's coaching during the losing streak, he said: \"I'm going to be very trite. I was a lot happier with what he had done the first three games than what's happened the last three games. But the big thing I want to say is it's not just him. This is across the board.\"\n\nJones doesn't intend on making an in-season coaching change, per ESPN's Todd Archer, and reports back up that assertion:\n\nBut the decision to continue with Garrett has not come without scrutiny. In parts of 10 seasons, he has gone 80-62, a solid enough mark. But he's only led the Cowboys to three playoff appearances and has gone 2-3 in the postseason, never getting past the divisional round despite having some talented squads.\n\nIt's been 24 years since the Cowboys won a Super Bowl. A loss to the Philadelphia Eagles next week in a crucial NFC East showdown would be another indication that Garrett perhaps isn't equipped to end that drought.", "description": "The  Dallas Cowboys  have lost three straight games, including falling 24-22 to the previously winless  New York Jets  on Sunday, but head coach Jason Garrett isn't worried about potentially losing his job amid the team's struggles...", "authors": ["Timothy Rapp"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/832/954/hi-res-e313299c64514d069f7afd48a23599f6_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
