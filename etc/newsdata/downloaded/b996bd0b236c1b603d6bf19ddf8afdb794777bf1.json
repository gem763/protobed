Therefore, if Benny Gantz offers Netanyahu to sit down with him one-on-one, I'm confident that Netanyahu will sit with him.'\n\nIsraeli public television reporters caught up with Gantz outside his home after a workout on Tuesday morning.\n\n'We're always optimistic, it's a way of life,' he said from behind the wheel of his car, dressed in shorts and a T-shirt.\n\nA senior member of his centrist Blue and White alliance was strongly critical of Netanyahu.\n\n'What has Bibi done with the mandate to build a government? Four weeks of nothing,' Ofer Shelah said on Twitter, using Netanyahu's nickname.\n\n'He passed the time in order to continue as prime minister for a little while longer... Bibi wants elections. That is obvious.'\n\nThe Blue and White leader had no political experience before he mounted his challenge to the prime minister he once worked with as military chief of staff, but has now found himself at the doorstep of power.\n\nEntering the office Netanyahu has held for a total of more than 13 years, however, would be a challenge even to the most skilled politician.\n\nThe deadlock following last month's polls will likely require major concessions or a decision by members of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud to abandon him -- and the two options appear a long way off for now.\n\nBoth Likud and Blue and White say they want a unity government, but they are divided on how to achieve it.\n\nLikud has been seeking to negotiate based on a compromise set out by Rivlin that takes into account the possibility the premier will be indicted for corruption in the coming weeks.\n\nIt could see him remain prime minister for now, but step aside at some point later as he combats the charges.\n\nGantz would take over as acting premier under such a scenario.\n\nBlue and White says Gantz should be prime minister first under any rotation arrangement since his party won the most seats, finishing with 33 compared to Likud's 32.\n\nGantz also says Blue and White cannot serve in a government with a prime minister facing serious indictment.\n\nAn opinion survey released Tuesday showed 56 per cent of the public supports a rotation between Gantz and Netanyahu as prime minister.\n\nSome 65 per cent said Netanyahu should resign as head of Likud if indicted, in the poll conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute think tank.", "description": "President Rivlin will ask Benny Gantz - who first entered Israeli politics just nine months ago - on Wednesday evening to create a national unity coalition.", "authors": ["Joe Middleton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/08/20073012-0-image-a-2_1571816917238.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
