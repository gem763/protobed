China\u2019s lead in 5G also gives it a head start in a vast array of industrial and consumer applications.\n\nOf these applications, the one that most unnerves the American security establishment is quantum cryptography, a technology pioneered by China that is theoretically unhackable.\n\nIntelligence agencies\n\nOn July 7 I revealed in this publication that the new 5G systems would embed quantum cryptography, preventing US intelligence agencies from eavesdropping on the world\u2019s communications and destroying a key American advantage.\n\nThat is why the intelligence community prevailed on the Trump administration to derail Huawei\u2019s 5G rollout at all costs.\n\nControl of game-changing technologies like 5G broadband \u2013 the sort of technology that transforms the lives of billions of people and generates trillions of dollars in wealth \u2013 is passing to China for the first time.\n\nChina has a disturbing record of technology theft, to be sure, but China\u2019s past misbehavior is of minor importance compared to its homegrown innovations.\n\nThe United States didn\u2019t bring the proverbial knife to a gunfight. It brought nothing to the gunfight, because no American company produces 5G equipment, and the European alternatives to Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia, offer an inferior and more expensive product.\n\nThe Trump administration might have tried to persuade US companies to enter the field, but it showed no interest in creating an American national champion to compete with Huawei.\n\nSkills lacking\n\nAmerica\u2019s trade deficit with China is a minor issue next to the tech war the United States is losing. China\u2019s biggest exports to the United States are low-value-added consumer electronics, products that the United States lacks the skills and supply chain to make, and doesn\u2019t want to make, because the labor is paid below American standards.\n\nThe US has lost the first decisive engagement of the economic war with China. To my knowledge, Washington has no plans to revive American production of key technologies, nor any plans to put the resources into R&D that would enable the US to counter China\u2019s advantage in some key technologies.\n\nWashington\u2019s military and national security establishments are now in a collective tantrum over the hitherto unimaginable fact that the Chinese have gotten the better of them.\n\nAmerican rancor against China arises from the belated realization that sloth, complacency and fecklessness have allowed a country that two generations ago starved 50 million of its people to death to rise and challenge American dominance.\n\nHope of victory lost?\n\nIt recalls Kaiser Wilhelm II\u2019s urgent advice to his cousin Nicholas II of Russia in 1904 to go to war against Japan as the \u201csavior of the white race.\u201d In consequence, Russia lost its entire fleet to Japan and brought on the 1905 Revolution and, ultimately, the fall of the Romanov dynasty.\n\nFor the past year I have warned that America\u2019s confrontation with China would terminate in the economic equivalent of Port Arthur.\n\nOn June 12, 2003, I observed in this publication that the worst damage in war typically occurs after the hope of victory has vanished. Sadly, this may apply to the economic war between the US and China as well.\n\nDue to the migration of the Asia Times archives to a new server, the article is not presently available, so I quote the relevant content below:\n\n\u201cA recurring theme in the history of war is that most of the killing typically occurs long after rational calculation would call for the surrender of the losing side. Think of the Japanese after Okinawa, the Germans after the Battle of the Bulge, or the final phase of the Peloponnesian War, the Thirty Years War, or the Hundred Years War. Across epochs and cultures, blood has flown in proportion inverse to the hope of victory. Perhaps what the Middle East requires in order to achieve a peace settlement is not less killing, but more.\n\n\u201cMut der Verzweiflung, as the Germans call it, courage borne of desperation, arises not from the delusion that victory is possible, but rather from the conviction that death is preferable to surrender. Wars of this sort end long after one side has been defeated, namely when enough of the diehards have been killed. Don\u2019t blame the president\u2019s provincialism. This has nothing to do with Bushido, Nazi fanaticism or other exotic ideologies.\n\n\u201cThe most compelling case of Mut der Verzweiflung can be found in Bush\u2019s own back yard, during the American Civil War of 1861-1865. The Southern cause was lost after Major General Ulysses S Grant took Vicksburg and General George G Meade repelled General Robert E Lee at Gettysburg in July 1863. With Union forces in control of the Mississippi River, the main artery of Southern commerce, and without the prospect of a breakout to the North, the Confederacy of slaveholding states faced inevitable strangulation by the vastly superior forces of the North.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, the South fought on for another 18 months. Between Gettysburg and Vicksburg, the two decisive battles of the war fought within the same week, 100,000 men had died, bringing the total number of deaths in major battles to more than a quarter of a million. Another 200,000 soldiers would die before Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox in April 1865.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on AsiaTimes.", "description": "As the United States and China escalate the past year\u2019s .09/02/2019 3:07:32AM EST.", "authors": ["David P.
