Two of my journalist colleagues were attacked with bottles and metal cans thrown above the riot police line. While filming the scene, I was punched, kicked and hit with a club by a group of four people.\n\nThe Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's representative on freedom of the media, Harlem D\u00e9sir, was quick to condemn the violence. The Polish government, however, was ambiguous and unhurried in its response.\n\n\"It's worth asking whether such events should be organized in the future, as they are raising huge resistance,\" Education Minister Dariusz Piontkowski said after the attacks in Bia\u0142ystok.\n\nWhile PiS is gradually suppressing systems of public scrutiny, including the media and people who don't fit into its \"patriotic \" narrative, Poland's civic society and its institutions have been the ones to fight for our democratic rights.\n\nIt's thanks to them \u2014 to the judges who fight for the independence of the judiciary and the thousands of Poles who take to the streets in support of the rule of law \u2014 that Poland is still a democracy.\n\nThese are the people who need defending now, not the ruling party.\n\nMaciek Piasecki\n\nJournalist at fact-checking non-profit OKO.press\n\nWarsaw, Poland", "description": "PiS has waged an all-out campaign against media freedom, judicial independence and minorities.", "authors": ["Maciek Piasecki", "Agnieszka Kolakowska"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1175596057-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
