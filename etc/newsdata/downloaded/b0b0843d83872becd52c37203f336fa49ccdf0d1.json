While you often fact check his statements in real time during your discussions, that is no longer enough. By giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation,\u201d the letter from top aides Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield reads.\n\n\u201cWe write to demand that in service to the facts, you no longer book Rudy Giuliani, a surrogate for Donald Trump who has demonstrated that he will knowingly and willingly lie in order to advance his own narrative,\u201d the letter continues.\n\nThe Biden campaign letter goes on to note that \u201cGiuliani is not a public official, and holds no public office that would entitle him to opine on the nation\u2019s airwaves.\u201d And it demands that if the former mayor is put on the airwaves, \u201can equivalent amount of time\u201d be given \u201cto a surrogate for the Biden campaign.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Tani", "Thedailybeast.Com Biden-Campaign-Demands-Tv-News-Execs-Stop-Booking-Rudy-Giuliani"], "top_image": ""}
