Guyger had faced between five and 99 years behind bars.\n\nGuyger, who is white, insisted she thought she was in her own apartment when she shot Jean, who is black, on Sept. 6, 2018, saying she believed he was an armed intruder.\n\nRELATED: Cop Who Killed Man In His Apartment Admits She\u2019s Racist in Text Messages\n\nIn considering her sentence, jurors reviewed several racist and violent text messages and social media postings linked to Guyger\u2019s phone and social media accounts.
