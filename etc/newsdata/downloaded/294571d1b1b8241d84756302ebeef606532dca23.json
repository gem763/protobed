This was driven by seven grocery-anchor renewals this quarter, another record, and our 94.7% tenant retention rate. Positive growth in rental rates on renewals as well as net new leasing drove a 1.8% increase in trailing twelve month same-property NOI. The new leasing and strong retention ratio also drove an occupancy increase of 110 basis points, to 94.4%. The team\u2019s proactive approach to leasing as well as a continued shortage of new supply continue to support a favorable leasing environment for well capitalized landlords, like Slate Retail,\u201d said Greg Stevenson, Chief Executive Officer.\n\nMr. Stevenson continued, \u201cTotal debt was reduced by $74.7 million as we continue to execute on our disposition pipeline at attractive prices, a weighted average 6.4% cap rate so far this year. Looking forward, the path to continued growth remains clear with over $1.5 million of rent from signed leases not yet contributing to net operating income and the $20.5 million redevelopment pipeline with an estimated yield on cost of 10.3%. Lastly, we anticipate making strategic acquisitions that will help offset dilution from dispositions while also improving the overall quality of the portfolio. We continue to believe the long-term predictability of the cash flows generated by grocery-anchored real estate is being widely overlooked.\u201d\n\nFor the CEO\u2019s letter to unitholders for the quarter, please follow the link here.\n\nHighlights\n\nThe REIT approved an increase of its monthly distribution by 1.1% to U.S.$0.072 per unit, or U.S.$0.864 annually, beginning with its December 2019 distribution. This increase is the sixth consecutive annual distribution increase since the REIT listed its class U units on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2014.\n\nCompleted 745,112 square feet of leasing in the quarter, comprised of 684,162 square feet of lease renewals at a 5.6% weighted average spread above expiring rent and 60,950 square feet of new leasing at a 15.1% premium to the weighted average in-place rent of comparable space.\n\nThe weighted average tenant retention rate for the third quarter was 94.7%. Since the beginning of 2016, the weighted average retention rate has been 91.7%.\n\nNet income for the quarter was $4.5 million, an increase of $5.5 million from the same quarter in the prior year. This is primarily due to the change in fair value of properties.\n\nThe REIT continued to execute on its capital recycling program during the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, the REIT has completed 14 dispositions for $81.2 million at a weighted average cap rate of 6.4% on trailing twelve-month net operating income (\u201cNOI\u201d). The REIT will seek to reinvest net proceeds into new accretive investment opportunities that will strengthen the quality of the REIT\u2019s portfolio and drive NOI growth.\n\nRental revenue over the quarter was $34.5 million, a decrease of $1.2 million over the same period in the prior year due to the disposition of eight properties and 14 outparcels, partially offset by rental rate growth from re-leasing at rates above in-place rents, new leasing and the acquisition of one property and an interest in one property.\n\nNOI was $24.4 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2019, compared to $25.6 million in the same period in the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to the aforementioned lost contribution in rental revenue from the dispositions that occurred over the comparative period.\n\nOf the last 12 quarters, the REIT has had 9 quarters of positive same-property NOI growth. Same-property NOI for the trailing twelve month period ended September 30, 2019 (comprised of 69 properties) increased by 1.8% over the same period in the prior year, while same-property NOI for the three month period ended September 30, 2019 (comprised of 72 properties) decreased by 1.0% over the comparative period due to an increase in operating expenses during the quarter and the timing of termination income.\n\nFunds from operations (\u201cFFO\u201d) was $12.9 million or $0.29 per unit, a decrease of $0.03 per unit from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the aforementioned lost contribution in rental revenue from the dispositions that occurred over the comparative period.\n\nAdjusted funds from operations (\u201cAFFO\u201d) was $11.1 million or $0.25 per unit, representing a $0.05 per unit increase compared to the same quarter in 2018, mainly due to a $3.6 million decrease in capital, leasing, and tenant improvement spend.\n\nThree months ended September 30, (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per unit amounts) 2019 2018 Change % Rental revenue $ 34,545 $ 35,699 (3.2 )% NOI $ 24,385 $ 25,551 (4.6 )% Net income (loss) $ 4,513 $ (1,024 ) 540.7 % Leasing \u2013 shop space 129,255 127,956 1.0 % Leasing \u2013 anchor / junior anchor 615,857 130,158 373.2 % Total leasing activity (square feet) (1) 745,112 258,114 188.7 % Weighted average number of units outstanding (\u201cWA units\u201d) 44,107 45,489 (3.0 )% FFO (2) $ 12,936 $ 14,469 (10.6 )% FFO per WA units (2) $ 0.29 $ 0.32 (9.4 )% FFO payout ratio (2) 72.7 % 66.5 % 6.2 % AFFO (2) $ 11,142 $ 8,998 23.8 % AFFO per WA units (2) $ 0.25 $ 0.20 25.0 % AFFO payout ratio (2) 84.4 % 107.0 % (22.6 )% (in thousands of U.S. dollars) 2019 2018 Change % Same-property NOI (3 month period, 72 properties) $ 22,246 $ 22,478 (1.0 )% Same-property NOI (12 month period, 69 properties) $ 84,284 $ 82,801 1.8 % As at September 30, (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per unit amounts) 2019 2018 Change % Total assets $ 1,336,836 $ 1,472,898 (9.2 )% Total debt $ 798,147 $ 875,227 (8.8 )% Net asset value per unit $ 10.89 $ 12.39 (12.1 )% Number of properties (1) 79 86 (8.1 )% Portfolio occupancy (1) 94.4 % 94.3 % 0.1 % Debt / GBV ratio 59.7 % 59.4 % 0.3 % Interest coverage ratio (2) 2.46x 2.64x (6.8 )% (1) Includes the REIT\u2019s share of its equity accounted property investment.
