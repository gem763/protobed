This came after the two countries have been involved in tit-for-tat tariffs over the last year and a half.\n\nYet, presidential candidate Mayor Pete Buttigieg sees the trade tensions as bigger than just tariffs.\n\n\u201cI actually think China presents more of a challenge than any of my fellow Democrats do,\u201d Buttigieg said at The New Yorker Festival. \u201cIt\u2019s because I look at what\u2019s happening there and what I see is the use of technology for the perfection of dictatorship.\n\n\u201cBut, that doesn\u2019t mean that the president\u2019s approach makes any sense,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not a strategy. He\u2019s just poking the guy to see what will happen. Moreover, he\u2019s essentially reduced the U.S-China relationship to the question of who\u2019s selling more dishwashers.\u201d\n\nPete Buttigieg, South Bend Mayor and Democratic presidential hopeful, speaks at a campaign event in Dubuque, Iowa, U.S. September 23, 2019. REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage More\n\nButtigieg is referring to the collateral damage of the trade war: the effects on American consumers. The tariff hike on goods from both countries meant higher prices on consumer items like washing machines, furniture, and dishwashers \u2014 goods that are largely imported from China.\n\nBy the end of 2019, the tariffs will have cost the average household $1,315 over a two-year period, according to a report from the National Foundation for American Policy. It is also projected that tariffs will cost American households more than $2,000 per year in 2020.\n\n\u201cWhile trade concerns are very important, I would actually link them to a bigger set of questions around strategy, around security, and around values, which brings us to Hong Kong,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\n\u2018Embarrassing for the United States\u2019\n\nThe Hong Kong protests, stemming from calls for democratic reforms in regards to its relationship with China, picked up steam in June 2019. Since then, demonstrations have occurred throughout the streets in the country, sparking international attention. The NBA even found themselves in the center of it after the Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of the Hong Kong protesters, leading Chinese companies to suspend licensing agreements with the NBA, putting the partnership between the organization and China at risk.\n\nAnti-government demonstrators march in protest against the invocation of the emergency laws in Hong Kong, China, October 12, 2019.

During trade talks with China\u2019s Vice Premier Liu He on Friday, Trump remarked, \u201cI think that\u2019s going to take care of itself. I actually think this deal is a great deal for the people of Hong Kong to see what happened. I think this is a very positive thing for Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nButtigieg doesn\u2019t see it that way, however.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening in Hong Kong is people are speaking up for democracy and they haven\u2019t heard a peep out of the White House supporting them, even offering the most tepid moral support for their quest for democracy. And that is embarrassing for the United States.\n\nAdriana is an associate editor for Yahoo Finance.
