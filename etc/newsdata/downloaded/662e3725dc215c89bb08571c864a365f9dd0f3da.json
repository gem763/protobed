The welcome sign out front of one rink used to say \u201cTrump\u201d at the top; now the name is at the very bottom, under the phone number. \u201cOperated by the Trump Organization,\u201d the sign says.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s company still runs these two ice rinks. For them, then, the changes in branding mark a milestone: For the first time since Trump took office, two of Trump\u2019s own businesses seem to be trying to downplay their connection to his name.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complete rebranding,\u201d said Geoffrey Croft, of the watchdog group NYC Park Advocates. These rinks, which once shouted the president\u2019s name, now barely mention it. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken [the name] off everything. Off the uniforms, everything.\u201d\n\nTrump has run the rinks since the 1980s, under a concession from the city of New York. The rinks actually played a major role in the creation of Trump as a national celebrity: In the 1980s, he took over a languishing city-run renovation project and famously finished the rink himself, on time and under budget.\n\nAD\n\nOfficially, the two rinks have other names: Wollman Rink in the southern part of the park, and Lasker Rink at the park\u2019s northern end. But Trump displayed his name as prominently \u2014 or more prominently \u2014 than the official names.\n\nAD\n\nThe two rinks had been heavily branded with the Trump name through last winter\u2019s skating season. But this summer, a city spokeswoman said, the Trump Organization decided to make a change.\n\n\u201cThe Trump organization notified us in late August that they planned to change the on-rink branding,\u201d Crystal Howard, a spokeswoman for the city parks department, said in an email message. She said the city did not ask for the change and that the company did not explain why it did it.\n\nAD\n\nWhen a Washington Post reporter visited Wollman Rink on Tuesday, the only prominent appearance of the Trump name was on the Zamboni ice-resurfacing machine. Employees weren\u2019t sure if it would stay there, either. Croft, the parks watchdog, said an employee had told him it would come off.\n\nThe Trump Organization did not respond to questions about the change.\n\nAD\n\nWhen the Post reporter visited the rink this week, one employee theorized that the decision was made because the Trump branding was driving some customers away.\n\n\u201cI do believe that\u2019s the answer. It was hurting business,\u201d the employee said. The employee spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. \u201cA lot of the schools, you know, liberal private schools up here, come to parties up here. That was a big income earner up here Monday and Tuesday night.\u201d\n\nThe New York Post reported on one instance of that in early 2017: a skating party at the Wollman Rink for children from the elite Dalton School was canceled, the paper reported, after some parents refused to let their children go to a rink emblazoned with Trump\u2019s name.\n\nAD\n\nTrump built an empire on branding, leaving his name on dozens of hotels, buildings and golf courses. Since Trump took office, his name has been removed from three hotels and six Manhattan residential buildings. But those were other people\u2019s buildings whose owners had paid to license the Trump name.\n\nAD\n\nThe ice rinks, by contrast, are run directly by Trump\u2019s firm. The change is their decision, the city said. The Post has not identified any other instances in which the Trump Organization voluntarily removed so much Trump-branded signage from any property.\n\nThese ice rinks are \u2014 like many other Trump properties \u2014 marooned in a liberal city, far from the rural and exurban voters whom Trump relies on as a politician. In 2015, Trump quickly reversed his public image, from a hotel owner who courted urban elites to a hard-right politician who denounced them.\n\nAD\n\nBut unlike Trump\u2019s hotels in New York, Chicago and Doral, Fla., the Trump-branded ice rinks had not suffered declines since Trump ran for office.\n\nIn fact, their income had risen about 12 percent from 2015 to 2018, according to figures provided by New York City. That was roughly in line with trends at other popular rinks in the city.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to not go because it\u2019s Donald Trump . . . even though I hate him and I don\u2019t want him to be my president,\u201d said Amy Townsend, 57, a visitor from Los Angeles who was walking in the park this week. She also said that even a Trump-branded ice rink wouldn\u2019t dissuade her from skating: \u201cIf I want to ice skate in this beautiful area, I\u2019m going to do that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Wollman Rink played a significant role in the creation of Trump as a local and national celebrity. In the 1980s, the city was mired in an over-budget, long-delayed renovation project.\n\nTrump, then known as a playboy real estate developer, offered to take the project over. He did, and finished it ahead of schedule. In return, Trump got the valuable concession to run the rink \u2014 and a national reputation as a businessman who talked big and got results.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time he\u2019s famous not for his nightlife, but for improving urban civic life,\u201d said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University.\n\n\u201cYou know what this tells me?\u201d Moss said of the removal of the Trump-branded signs. \u201cHe\u2019s a businessman. He knows the name Wollman [Rink] is better without Trump.\u201d\n\nFahrenthold reported from Washington.\n\nAD", "description": "For the first time since Trump took office, two of his businesses seem to downplay their connection to his name.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics", "David A.
