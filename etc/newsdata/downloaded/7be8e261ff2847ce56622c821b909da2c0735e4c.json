And, after his latest impressive finish, \u201cPatchy\u201d says he\u2019s now chasing the biggest fights \u2013 and wants a bigger paycheck to match.\n\nMix (12-0 MMA, 2-0 BMMA) finished late replacement Isiah Chapman (9-4 MMA, 0-1 BMMA) via first-round Suloev stretch and said that by hitting that rarely-seen submission technique, he made good on a promise he made to himself after his victory over Ricky Bandejas on his Bellator debut.\n\n\u201cMy last fight, I body-triangled Ricky Bandejas, and when he bent over, I should have went for it on him; I could have grabbed his ankle and didn\u2019t,\u201d Mix explained. \u201cBut I stuck with the rear-naked choke. I would have been a star then if I did it, so I was kicking myself in the butt for it, and then, I was like, \u2018If I get there this time and he stands up, I\u2019m hitting my move.'\u201d\n\nMix says his submission arsenal is unlike anything else presented by the other contenders in the bantamweight division and warned his future opponents that he has plenty more tricks up his sleeve for his upcoming fights.\n\n\u201cBasically, my coach says it: We\u2019ve got a machine gun full of bullets, and he can\u2019t dodge them all,\u201d Mix explained. \u201cThat\u2019s what my submission attempts are. I have so many in my bag, and my rear-naked choke is not my best one. They thought that\u2019s all I had from my Ricky fight. I have a whole list, and that\u2019s not even my best one. I have a bunch of other ones that are much better.\u201d\n\nMix has only competed twice inside the Bellator cage, but the dynamic bantamweight has already proved that he is one of the top contenders in the 135-pound division. He\u2019s already targeting the title, and he says he only wants big fights from here on in.\n\n\u201cI had a contender this fight, man \u2013 Dominic Mazzotta,\u201d Mix explained. \u201cHe actually pulled out. I wanted that name. I\u2019m grateful I had Isiah Chapman, but I just took out Ricky Bandejas \u2013 he\u2019s a big contender in the division \u2013 in under a minute, so it\u2019s no step up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been taking out contenders. I\u2019ve taken out Ricky, two UFC guys \u2013 Andre Ewell and Tony Gravely \u2013 all (in) under five minutes if you add up all the times, so I\u2019m already a contender. I already am stepping up, and I want another fight soon.\u201d\n\nThat fight could potentially come on Dec. 29 when Bellator heads to Japan. Mix is perfectly placed to be lined up as one of the three Bellator representatives in the Bellator vs. Rizin challenge matches on the card. If that possibility pans out, he says he\u2019s more than ready to throw down at the Saitama Super Arena.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 12-0 with nine finishes, seven in the first round,\u201d Mix said. \u201cI\u2019m on a 23-fight winning streak because in my amateur career I finished 17 people. I know they have a show in Japan, and I know they\u2019re talking about it. I\u2019m going to go and work on my passport right now.\n\n\u201cI definitely want to fight again, (and) I\u2019m definitely healthy. If they want to match me up in Japan, let\u2019s do it.\u201d\n\nMix\u2019s main aim, however, is to secure his fighting future in the form of a beefed-up Bellator contract, and he says the best way to do that is to secure a fight with the current two-promotion bantamweight champion Kyoji Horiguchi.\n\n\u201cIf Bellator pays me well enough, I\u2019m here to fight the contenders in the division, but I want to get paid for my services now,\u201d he said. \u201cMy record speaks for itself. With the contract right now that I\u2019m on, even Horiguchi, I know that comes with money, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m chasing Horiguchi.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not chasing these other contenders for this amount of money right now. I\u2019m chasing Horiguchi, because that entails a new contract.\u201d", "description": "Bantamweight contender Patrick Mix has called for bigger fights, and a bigger contract, after his latest submission win.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Matt Erickson", "Blue Corner", "Farah Hannoun", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan", "John Morgan", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/patrick-mix-bellator-232-post.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
