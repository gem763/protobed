Since the financial crisis, inflation has fluctuated mostly below 2% in the United States whether the unemployment rate was 10% or less than 4%, whether the Fed pursued easy money or tightened.\n\nSince 2014, European policy rates below 0% \u2014 central banks charging banks for deposits that they must keep at the ECB and other central bank s\u2014 have ushered in ultra-cheap loans for businesses. And governments can sell bonds that charge investors for the privilege of lending them money, but those have done little to boost European growth.\n\nTerrible in the long run\n\nNegative interest rates can have a quick short-term positive effect \u2014 force banks to make some worthy loans in times of business crisis \u2014 but continuing those long term is a terrible idea.\n\nFor one thing, ultra-low and negative rates fundamentally weaken banks. Banks make money on the spread between their cost of funds and loan rates, can lower interest rates paid depositors only so much without a serf\u2019s revolt, and get squeezed as their primary assets\u2014cash reserves\u2014are essentially taxed.\n\nAnd they can\u2019t make loans to businesses lacking adequate demand to support expansion.\n\nUltra-low bond rates and long-term loans encourage zombie companies \u2014 unprofitable businesses that but for ultra-cheap loans would be scaling back, moving capital into new lines of activity or releasing capital to investors to shop for opportunities of their own.\n\nFacing criticism from Germany and others, Draghi\u2019s presumptive successor, Christine Lagarde, has promised to review the policy.\n\nTrump\u2019s recent invocation for the Fed to push rates below zero hardly reflects an understanding of the issues involved.\n\nDysfunctional\n\nStructural dysfunctions \u2014 more than the usual whipping boys, labor-market regulations and high taxes \u2014 are to blame in Europe. When the euro EURUSD, -0.1812% was established in 1999, assets, debts and prices were translated from local currencies into the new currency at prevailing exchange rates. Since, the productivity and competitiveness appear to have improved in northern states like Germany and the Netherlands and flagged in southern states like Italy and Spain.\n\nThat leaves the euro undervalued for the North and overvalued for the South, and trade imbalances between the two regions. Trade deficits in the South require large government deficits to sustain demand or for Germany to reduce its budget surpluses\u2014spend more.\n\nEurozone rules place a limit of 3% of GDP on government deficits in Italy and elsewhere and German fiscal orthodoxy is impervious to facts and reason\u2014Berlin hates negative interests rates but refuses to lead with fiscal stimulus.\n\nHence, the real positive effect for Europe of negative interest rates is to push down the euro against the dollar BUXX, +0.06% , increase the overall trade surplus with the United States, and essentially export some European unemployment to America. That strategy has its limits as we are seeing and the ECB continues to forecast pathetic growth.\n\nThe Chinese, Japanese and Europeans are all pursuing cheap currency policies and the U.S. trade deficit \u2014 aided by businesses\u2019 ability to shift imports to third counties in response to higher tariffs on China \u2014 has rewarded Trump\u2019s America First policy with a rising trade deficit.\n\nNeeds a jolt\n\nThe 2017 tax cut raised consumer spending last year but has not delivered an increase in investment, and despite a $1 trillion dollar deficit, the U.S. economy needs yet another fiscal jolt.\n\nTrump can blame the Fed but it\u2019s doubtful that much lower interest rates could do much to boost demand. What is needed here is for Congress and the president, for example, to roll out an infrastructure bill. That would enhance long-term competitiveness and growth \u2014 whereas plunging interest rates to zero or below would only weaken U.S. banks.\n\nWhat\u2019s really nuts here is suggesting negative interest rates for America.", "description": "Central bankers are chasing the wrong target \u2014 2% inflation \u2014 with interest-rate policies that have demonstrated little effectiveness for at least the last...", "authors": ["Peter Morici"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR487_powell_ZG_20190917191625.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
