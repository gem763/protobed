The president, Giuliani and others have repeatedly attempted to redirect the conversation to allegations that the then-vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid from Ukraine while demanding the firing of a prosecutor who was investigating gas company where Biden's son, Hunter, held a board position.\n\n\"I went there to get dirt on Joe Biden,\" Giuliani said. \"I got a nice straight case of Ukrainian collusion, and the minute I say 'Biden' the Washington press corps is going to go nuts. They've been covering it up for years.\"\n\nPolitiFact has rated the allegations against Biden as \"half-true,\" clarifying that the accusation overreaches \"by assuming that Joe Biden acted to protect the company his son was affiliated with,\" and noting that the prosecutor in question had drawn criticism in the past.\n\n\"These are very important things that have been covered up to protect slimy Joe,\" Giuliani declared.", "description": "'Ladies and gentlemen, go look at what the press has been covering up.'", "authors": ["Eleanor Mueller"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/90/96/f7a92381492eb0401ea926f4397c/20190922-rudy-ukraine-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
