Hoping for the same luck with Week 8! USA TODAY\n\nOn Monday, the Philadelphia Eagles released cornerback Orlando Scandrick. On Friday, he made his feelings about the organization known.\n\nScandrick appeared on FS1\u2019s \"Undisputed\" and had a lot to say about his former teammates and coaches. Notably, he claimed: \"The problem in Philadelphia is much, much deeper than me. I think they\u2019re having a tough time dealing with success.\u201d\n\nThe 32-year-old was cut after training camp but re-signed when the Eagles experienced injury woes in September. He recorded two strip-sacks and a touchdown in Week 5 before being released again. Scandrick dubbed the move, \u201creally, really scapegoat-ish.\u201d\n\nHe addressed more topics than his own hardships, calling out specific individuals within the organization, and his reviews weren\u2019t exactly glowing.\n\nScandrick went in on former teammates, saying the Eagles' defense was full of selfish players. But he reserved specific criticism for safety and team captain Malcolm Jenkins. The Eagles have had coverage issues all season, and Scandrick said Jenkins should step up.\n\nJenkins responded to Scandrick\u2019s comments on Friday afternoon. Talking to the media, Jenkins said, \u201cFor us to move on as a team, we can\u2019t have (expletive) like that in the room.\u201d\n\nYet not all of Scandrick\u2019s comments were scathing. He had nothing but praise for quarterback Carson Wentz, calling him \u201ca great guy\u201d and saying he was \u201cstand-up.\u201d\n\nThe Eagles had not yet responded to a message from USA TODAY Sports on Friday afternoon.\n\nPhiladelphia has struggled so far this season and is 3-4. The Eagles were blown out by the Dallas Cowboys last week in an embarrassing 37-10 loss. They will look to turn things around on Sunday against a resurgent Buffalo Bills team.", "description": "After being released earlier this week, ex-Eagles CB Orlando Scandrick trashed the Philly organization and former teammates in a scathing interview.", "authors": ["Thomas Hindle", "Published P.M.
