But these purchases were always among the most trivial elements of any deal and have been on the table for months.\n\nIt will do little to compensate US farmers, many of whom have been reduced to federal welfare recipients, costing the US Treasury more than it is collecting in tariff revenue.\n\nThe currently proposed tariffs are among the biggest tax increases in US history. However, their full force won\u2019t be apparent until after the December 15 tariff hike. US importers have already stockpiled goods ahead of the tariff increase, so the burden on US consumers and business, already substantial, won\u2019t be fully apparent until next year.\n\nThe US has also secured the outlines of a currency accord, which will likely borrow from similar provisions in the new US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement.\n\nWhereas the US previously advocated flexible exchange rates as conducive to free trade, the US will being asking China to manage its exchange rate in US interests.\n\nThe US has already designated China a \u2018currency manipulator\u2019 for accommodating the market forces pushing its exchange rate against the US dollar lower. But for Chinese intervention to support its currency, the depreciation would have been even more dramatic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDifferent views\n\nThe US and China will likely take different views on whether China\u2019s exchange rate management is consistent with the deal.\n\nBecause the deal is effectively an executive memorandum of understanding, it will have none of the dispute settlement and enforcement mechanisms found in properly negotiated and legislated free trade agreements.\n\nIn the absence of these mechanisms, the currency accord and other provisions are likely to occasion future punitive tariffs and retaliation.\n\nThe deal includes some progress on strengthening intellectual property protections, but omits a wide range of key issues, most notably China\u2019s state subsidies and state-directed lending to Chinese firms and forced technology transfer.\n\nThe US blacklisting of Huawei and other Chinese entities is out of scope. Meanwhile, the US is opening up new fronts in the trade war targeting cross-border capital flows.\n\nThe proposed deal will take weeks to turn into an agreed text. The plan to sign it at the APEC summit meeting in Chile in November would seem ambitious. The deal may fall over on the detail between now and then.\n\nGiven the 15 months it has taken to reach a trivial \u2018phase one\u2019 deal, progress on more substantive issues is going to be tough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSignificant damage to the world economy has already been done. It comes not so much from the direct impact of the tariffs, but the uncertainty they have generated.\n\nThat uncertainty has prompted a global capital strike and decline in business investment, including in Australia.\n\nGlobal manufacturing is in recession and trade volumes are contracting, even before the full effect of tariffs is felt.\n\nThe outlook for the US and world economy would have been much better but for Donald Trump\u2019s trade war, even with the Chinese economy slowing.\n\nA fully-fledged and properly legislated accord between the US and China covering the substantive issues between them would take many years to negotiate and implement.\n\nTrump\u2019s preference for an executive agreement, which he calls \u2018fast and clean\u2019, means that the US can dispose of any or all of the provisions at Trump\u2019s choosing.\n\nThe Trump administration has indicated that tariffs will remain a key compliance and enforcement mechanism.\n\nChina\u2019s interests are best served by pushing the worst of the trade war into the 2020 presidential election year, when Trump will have to explain to the American people what he has to show for the damage he has inflicted.", "description": "China will be the ultimate winner if the cost to Americans hits home in an election year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3549%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_176%2C$y_124/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c6d8dff976bdf8d80a65c7319564712f79ddd591", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
