They entered the final round tied and stayed that way through the front nine.\n\nThomas birdied 14th to take one-stroke lead, then went up by two when Lee bogeyed the 15th after missing a 10-foot par putt and Thomas made a two-footer for par. After going from greenside bunker to bunker on the 16th, Green bogeyed again and fell three behind. But Thomas bogeyed the 17th after his 12-footer for par lipped out, reducing the deficit to two strokes.\n\nOn Saturday, Thomas had a three-stroke lead heading into the 18th ahead of a three-shot swing when Thomas bogeyed and Lee made a long eagle putt. On Sunday, there were no such late miracles for Lee: Thomas and Lee both birdied the 18th, with Lee lipping out on his eagle putt to finish with a 69.\n\nThomas finished with a 72-hole total of 20-under 268 at Nine Bridges.\n\nHideki Matsuyama (65), last year\u2019s runner-up Gary Woodland (66) and Australian Cameron Smith (69) finished tied for third, five behind Thomas. Jordan Spieth closed with a 71 and was tied with four others at 12-under.\n\nPhil Mickelson finished with a 68 and Jason Day with a 71, both at 7-under.\n\nThe PGA Tour\u2019s second of three weeks in Asia continues next week at the Zozo Championship in Japan - which will feature Tiger Woods - and ending with the World Golf Championship event in Shanghai.\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Justin Thomas won his 11th PGA Tour event and his second in South Korea in three years with a final-round 5-under 67 and a two-stroke victory over South Korean-born New Zealander Danny Lee.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/18/south_korea_golf_cj_cup_90107_c0-297-4000-2630_s1200x700.jpg?2bdef68853af959098a3501c4b3b80d804497abf", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
