He can look, and I hope he looks at the U.K., and I hope he looks at Australia, and I hope he looks at Ukraine. I hope he looks at everything because there was a hoax that was perpetrated on our country. It\u2019s the greatest hoax.\"\n\nIn response to that public comment, the Australians proactively contracted Barr offering assistance. Fox News has obtained a letter showing Australia's outreach, including an offer to use its \"best endeavors\" in \"support\" of Barr's probe.\n\nA senior Australian diplomat told Fox News: \"After the president said what he said - we initiated the contact. There was no pressure -- we acted in order to help.\"\n\nIn issuing his directive, the president was letting the heads of other countries know that the attorney general would be contacting the appropriate law enforcement entities in each country, according to the DOJ official. When Barr was in Italy last week, he did talk to law enforcement officials there about Durham's review, Fox News was told.\n\nThe DOJ official also stressed that this has been a routine procedure in diplomacy and that Barr would not usually reach out to his direct counterpart in another country unilaterally. Instead, usually there would be an introduction of sorts made at the head-of-state level.\n\nBarr assigned Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, back in May to conduct the inquiry into alleged misconduct and improper surveillance of the Trump campaign in 2016, as well as whether Democrats were the ones who'd improperly colluded with foreign actors.\n\n\"Mr. Durham is gathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries. At Attorney General Barr\u2019s request, the president has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the attorney general and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials,\" Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.\n\nDurham, known as a \"hard-charging, bulldog\" prosecutor, according to a source, has been focusing on the period before Nov. 7, 2016 \u2014 including the use and assignments of FBI informants, as well as alleged improper issuance of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants. Durham was asked to help Barr to \"ensure that intelligence collection activities by the U.S. government related to the Trump 2016 presidential campaign were lawful and appropriate.\"\n\nDemocrats increasingly have targeted Barr. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Friday that Barr has \"gone rogue,\" alleging an attempted \"cover-up\" of the whistleblower complaint that has led to an impeachment inquiry of the president.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nPelosi made the comments on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" after host Joe Scarborough asked if she was concerned that the country's institutions could fail due to Barr's behavior.\n\n\"I think where they are going is the cover-up of the cover-up, and that's very really sad for them. To have a Justice Department go so rogue, they have been for a while, and now it just makes matters worse,\" said Pelosi, faulting Barr for instructing the director of national intelligence to bring the whistleblower complaint to the White House.\n\nFox News' Bret Baier contributed to this report.", "description": "A Justice Department\u00a0official told Fox News on Monday that Attorney General Bill Barr asked President Trump to make introductions to foreign countries that might have had information pertinent to U.S. Attorney John Durham's ongoing probe into possible misconduct by the intelligence community\u00a0at the outset of the Russia investigation.", "authors": ["Jake Gibson", "Jake Gibson Is A Producer Working At The Fox News Washington Bureau Who Covers Politics", "Law Enforcement", "Intelligence Issues."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/14/694940094001_6086272465001_6086272739001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
