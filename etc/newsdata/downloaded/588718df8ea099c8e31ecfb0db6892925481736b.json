And, there, he continued to underscore his competition with Mr. Obama by speaking at length about what he said were his own premonitions about Bin Laden, rather than focusing on the events of the day.\n\nHe repeated the misleading claim that he delivered a warning about Bin Laden in one of his books. \u201cNobody listened to me,\u201d Mr. Trump lamented. \u201c To this day, I get people coming up to me, and they said \u2018you know one of the most amazing things I\u2019ve seen about you is that you predicted that Osama bin Laden had to be killed before he knocked down the World Trade Center.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn reality, Mr. Trump\u2019s book, \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d makes one passing reference to Bin Laden, where he is simply referred to as \u201cpublic enemy No. 1.\u201d\n\nBut on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump took credit not only for the raid that killed Mr. a-Baghdadi, but also for having been wiser than his predecessors. \u201cI made a prediction,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way. If they would have listened to me, a lot of things would have been different.\u201d\n\nFrom his implicit undermining of Mr. Obama to his focus on the fact that he has never received the credit he deserves, Mr. Trump handled the moment in a familiar way: putting himself at the center of the action, releasing information such as the number of helicopters involved in the operation that are normally classified, and focusing on vivid, cinematic details of a raid he bragged unfolded \u201cas though you were watching a movie.\u201d", "description": "Aides convinced President Trump that waiting until Sunday morning to announce Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s death would dominate the talk shows.", "authors": ["Annie Karni", "Maggie Haberman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/multimedia/27dc-trump/27dc-trump-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
