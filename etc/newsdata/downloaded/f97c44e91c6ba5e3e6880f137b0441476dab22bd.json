Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is working to elevate her status as one of the most outspoken pro-union presidential candidates and is expected to join teachers in Chicago on Tuesday as part of their ongoing strike, visiting a South Austin elementary school and \u201cpicketing with teachers and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten,\u201d according to local reports.\n\nThursday marked the first day of the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) strike, resulting in the cancellation of classes for the 361,000 K-12 students who attend Chicago Public Schools (CPS). The union and CPS have been unable to reach a negotiation on numerous issues, including salaries, benefits, and classroom size.\n\nWarren is expected to join them as they go into their fourth day of the strike.\n\nNBC Chicago reports:\n\nAccording to a campaign email, the stop in Chicago will be part of a two-stop swing for the Democratic presidential candidate on Tuesday. Warren will join striking teachers in Chicago at a South Austin elementary school on the city\u2019s West Side, picketing with teachers and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten.\n\nWarren has made tangible efforts to position herself as one of the most outspoken pro-union 2020 candidates, joining airport food workers in a minimum wage protest at Reagan National Airport in July:\n\nOn Labor Day, Warren called for \u201cstronger unions\u201d and declared that unions will \u201crebuild America\u2019s middle class.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnions built the middle class\u2014and unions will rebuild the middle class,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cIf we want more good American jobs, then we need stronger unions and more power in the hands of the people\u201d:\n\nUnions built the middle class\u2014and unions will rebuild the middle class. If we want more good American jobs, then we need stronger unions and more power in the hands of the people.

When workers organize and fight together, they win\u2014and they can change America. #LaborDay pic.twitter.com/0dVQuz4wWz \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 2, 2019\n\nI\u2019m in this fight for America\u2019s workers every step of the way. #LaborDay pic.twitter.com/NDK8iohEOp \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) August 30, 2019\n\nComing out of the Great Depression, labor unions helped build America\u2019s strong middle class. As our families got richer, our country got richer \u2013 & labor unions were a big part of it. Today, unions are under attack, & we need to fight back so workers can make their voices heard. pic.twitter.com/kM66Rb3CRg \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) September 1, 2019\n\nHappy #LaborDay! Today we say loud & clear: unions built America\u2019s middle class, & unions will rebuild America\u2019s middle class. pic.twitter.com/GbzfDsa914 \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) September 2, 2019\n\nAs for the CTU, negotiations are still underway, but progress, according to CTU President Jesse Sharkey, has halted. Sharkey accused Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration of \u201cvindictive actions\u201d and added that her recent letter \u201cdashed our hopes of a quick settlement,\u201d according to the Chicago Tribune.\n\nAccording to the report:\n\nSharkey\u2019s accusation came after Lightfoot and Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson made a plea to teachers to end their strike before a settlement and continue negotiations while working without a contract, leading Sharkey to say after negotiations ended for the day that Lightfoot\u2019s letter had \u201cdashed our hopes for a quick settlement.\u201d\n\nSharkey said in an email that their bargaining team was \u201cbeginning to see glimmers of progress on issues that matter to our members\u201d but added that progress \u201cstopped dead\u201d on Monday.\n\n\u201cIt was clear from the mayor\u2019s letter to the press demanding members go back to work without a contract and from the sudden atmosphere of stonewalling from the CPS team, that (Mayor Lori Lightfoot) had pulled the plug on negotiations,\u201d Sharkey wrote, according to the Chicago Tribune.\n\n\u201cThe mayor\u2019s team said that there was no more money in the budget to address the many outstanding demands that are necessary to deliver justice for our school communities,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile Lightfoot and CPS CEO Janice Jackson have said that \u201creal progress\u201d was being made, both made it clear that the strikes are hurting students.\n\nThey wrote:\n\nFor the fourth straight school day, students from throughout the city won\u2019t be participating in the athletic competitions they\u2019ve earned the right to compete in, won\u2019t be preparing their college applications with trusted school staff, and won\u2019t be in classrooms with the teachers who hold the keys to their success.\n\n\u201cWe must fix that immediately and end this strike,\u201d they added.", "description": "Sen.
