In Zuckerberg's telling, the U.S. needs a domestic corporation to launch a global payment system backed largely (but not completely) by the U.S. dollar or else other nations will adopt one backed by China. For months, details about a digital currency developed by China have been leaking from the country. Facebook executive David Marcus also raised the specter of a Chinese digital currency as a reason for Libra's supposed necessity in an interview with Bloomberg.\n\nLibra will extend America's \"financial leadership\" abroad, Zuckerberg said, as well as the \"values\" that such \"leadership\" imparts. Democratic Congressman Juan Vargas explained what this means in plain language. \"The dollar is very important to us as a tool of American power,\" Vargas said, and the U.S. \"would rather lay sanctions than send our soldiers there.\"\n\nIn response, Zuckerberg said that Libra (or at least Facebook's slice of it) is being designed to enforce U.S. sanctions. \"If we don't innovate, there's no guarantee that we can extend those same rules and project that kind of influence around the world going forward,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to weigh any risks of a new system against what I think are are surely risks if a Chinese financial system becomes the standard in more countries,\" Zuckerberg said at another point during the hearing. \"Then it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for us to impose our sanctions or the kinds of protections that I think we're right to want to have oversight around the world on all these different countries.\"\n\nLibra, which Facebook unveiled in June, is envisioned as a digital token backed by cash and \"highly liquid assets\" that people all over the world could use to transact. Facebook is taking the lead on Libra for now, but eventually control will be handed to an ostensibly independent founding board of 21 companies and nonprofits known as the Libra Association, which is based in Switzerland. Facebook seems to see itself as just one part of an eventual Libra ecosystem and plans to launch a wallet service called Calibra.\n\nAs for how Facebook plans to make money on Libra, Zuckerberg said that frictionless payments on Facebook would result in more value for the social network's ad business.\n\nDespite the clear narrative push for the necessity and inevitability of Libra, it's anything but a settled proposition. In the face of looming regulatory pressure, several Libra Association members\u2014including PayPal, MasterCard, and Visa\u2014have already dropped out of the project.\n\nAnd then there are the deep concerns over privacy when a company like Facebook (or the members of the Libra Association, which includes Uber) has any visibility whatsoever into people's financial transactions.\n\nWhether Zuckerberg is earnest at all in his naked appeal to American power, or if it's just another tactic to sell Libra to a skeptical audience, is unclear, as Facebook (like any corporation) pretty much just cares about making money.\n\nAt the hearing, Zuckerberg pledged that Facebook will not launch Libra products anywhere in the world without U.S. regulators' approvals.", "description": "The Facebook CEO's pitch to Congress on its planned cryptocurrency was a hard sell: Let us build it, or China will.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db0adc27b23db0092b51847/lede/1571861837322-Untitled-design.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
