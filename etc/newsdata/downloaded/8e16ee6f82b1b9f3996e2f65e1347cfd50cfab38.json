Hope for a dovish update from the European Central Bank was a factor, and so was an announcement from Beijing that it won\u2019t impose additional tariffs on 16 US imports. The update from the Chinese government was seen as a concession to the US, and it helped the trading relationship. Next month, delegates from the US and China are due to meet, and the move by Beijing was a step in the right direction.\n\n\n\nIn a further development to the trade situation. The US was due to impose tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports on 1 October, and that has been delayed until 15 October. The announcement largely helped stocks in Asia overnight.\n\n\n\nToday\u2019s ECB meeting has been at the forefront of traders\u2019 minds all week. The ECB is expected to loosening monetary policy. The base rate is expected to be kept on hold at 0.0%, and the deposit rate is currently -0.4%, and there is speculation it will be cut even further, in a bid to encourage banks to increase lending. There is also talk of a government bond-buying scheme being announced too, but traders remain divided over what the central might reveal.\n\n\n\nInflation in the currency bloc is 1% - nowhere near the ECB\u2019s target rate, and it is considerably lower than the CPI rate in the UK and the US, and that underlines the weakness in the region. Germany is the engine room of Europe, and the economy contracted in the second quarter, and there is fear it is heading for a recession. The ECB has a justification for loosening monetary policy, but it might be a staggered process. The ECB will reveal their interest rate decision at 12.45pm (UK time), and the press conference will follow at 1.30pm (UK time).\n\n\n\nOil sold-off sharply yesterday after it was revealed that President Trump discussed the possibility of easing sanctions on Iran. Earlier in the week, John Bolton left his role as National Security adviser, and it is believed he had a difference of opinion with Mr. Trump on a number of matters, but the Iranian issue was believed to have been the final straw.\n\n\n\nGold clawed back some of its recent losses. The metal reached a six-year high earlier this month when stocks were in turmoil, but yesterday the commodity bounced back. Golds\u2019 rally yesterday was all the more impressive given the move higher inequities and the rally in the greenback.\n\n\n\nThe final reading of German and French CPI will be released at 7 am (UK time) and 7.45am (UK time) respectively, and economists were expecting 1% and 1.2% respectively.\n\n\n\nEurozone industrial production will be posted at 10 am (UK time), and on a monthly basis, traders are expecting a decline of 0.1%.\n\n\n\nAt 1.30pm (UK time) US inflation will be posted, and the headline reading is expected to remain at 1.8%, and the core reading is expected to increase by 0.1% to 2.3%. At the same time, the jobless claims report will be announced, and economists are anticipating a drop from 217,000 to 215,000.\n\n\n\n\u2013 snapped back last week, and if it holds above 1.1000, it might pave the way for 1.1164 to be retested. If the wider bearish trend continues, it might target at 1.0900.\n\n\n\n\u2013 last Tuesday\u2019s daily candle has the potential to be a hammer, and if it holds above the 1.2200 area, it might bring 1.2400 into play. Support might be found at 1.1900, should the wider bearish move continue.\n\n\n\n\u2013 the weekly candle from mid-August appears to be a bearish reversal, and if the downward movement continues, it might target 0.8872. A rebound in the currency pair might bring 0.9200 into play.\n\n\n\n\u2013 rebounded last week, and a break above the 107.15 area \u2013 50-day moving average, it might bring 108.18 (100-day moving average) into play. Should the wider downtrend continue, it might retest the 104.50 area.\n\n\n\nis expected to open 37 points higher at 7,375\n\n\n\nis expected to open 65 points higher at 12,424\n\n\n\nis expected to open 30 points higher at 5,648\n\nDISCLAIMER: CMC Markets is an execution-only provider.
