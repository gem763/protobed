Apple also removed the app of news organization Quartz; its CEO, Zach Seward, said it was because of its continuing coverage of the Hong Kong protests. Meanwhile, Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet pulled The Revolution of Our Times, a game that allowed users to roleplay as Hong Kong protestors, saying it violated its terms by \u201ccapitalizing on sensitive events.\u201d Documents show it was removed at the request of the region\u2019s police. (Wall Street Journal, The Verge)\n\nTalking point: The concessions may help the two firms avoid further criticism from Beijing. But the stakes remain high for Apple, as China is both the site of much of its device assembly and its third-largest market. It made almost US$44 billion in the greater China region\u2014which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong sales\u2014in the year ending June 30. Google doesn\u2019t have as great a stake in China, where services like its search engine, Gmail and YouTube are already blocked. Though it pulled the game, the HKmap.live app remains available in the Google Play Store in Hong Kong and elsewhere.", "description": "", "authors": ["Hanna Lee"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
