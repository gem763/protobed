Looking back, I think, wow, that was really quite modern of my parents. When I was four, my mum sent me off to school with the advice, \u201cIf anyone teases you or makes fun of you, don\u2019t react.\u201d She was so right, because bullies want a reaction. It meant that this weirdly effeminate little kid didn\u2019t get bullied the whole way through school.\n\nGrowing up Protestant in the south of Ireland, I was kind of isolated. All the kids who lived around me didn\u2019t go to the same school, so I spent a lot of time alone. Television was my friend, and not in a sad way. I loved TV. I preferred TV to people. As a result, I\u2019m quite self-reliant. Even now, my perfect week involves lots of TV.\n\nBecause of my father\u2019s job, we lived in 13 houses in 17 years. That means you have to be quite flexible in terms of fitting in when you go to a new school. You find ways not to be the kid who\u2019s bullied, so I guess what I found was a weird combination of either being funny or blending into the background.\n\nMy parents were both funny. My mother has a sharp wit and, like me, can jump in with a quick judgment. My father could tell a good story, an Irish yarn. My sense of humour is closer to my mother\u2019s.\n\nBeing gay, I had to leave Ireland to find myself. I couldn\u2019t wait to get out. Some people didn\u2019t leave. The ones who stayed and fought and chipped away with placards and petitions \u2013 they\u2019re the heroes.\n\nThe most formative thing that ever happened to me was getting stabbed in 1989. It gave me real perspective on life and what mattered. Before that I was at drama school, caught up in the search for success. I went back to drama school and people were slamming doors because of the roles they got and I was like: \u201cUh, I nearly died. I\u2019m just really happy to be alive.\u201d Now if I get worried about something, I can put it into perspective.\n\nMy dogs, Bailey and Madge, bring me great joy and great sorrow. They\u2019re a daily lesson in mindfulness because they live in the present. All they think is, \u201cAm I thirsty? Am I horny? Am I tired?\u201d But they\u2019re about to bring deep sadness because they\u2019re ancient. Bailey is 15 and I\u2019ve discovered this year that Madge is actually older than him. It will be terrible when they go.\n\nI love going home to Ireland now. I have a house in County Cork. When you\u2019re a kid you want everything to be fast and shiny, but slow and dull has its own richness and that\u2019s what Ireland kind of has, as well as community.\n\nI always get excited about returning to the chat show. Each time there\u2019s a slight sense of, \u201cOoh, can I still do this?\u201d But then you see the people on the sofa and the 600 people in the audience all geed up and you think, \u201cActually, I don\u2019t suck at this job. There\u2019s a reason I\u2019ve been doing it so long.\u201d It\u2019s good to remind yourself of that occasionally.\n\nThe Graham Norton Show is on BBC One at 10.35pm on Fridays", "description": "The broadcaster, 56, tells Vicki Power about wearing his sister\u2019s dresses, preferring TV to people and not being bullied", "authors": ["Vicki Power"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/312045304cf9aa8f50314edb69d67540e8892d85/499_1359_5163_3097/master/5163.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cd88a23708fa16eaf36b543f0c3328b0", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
