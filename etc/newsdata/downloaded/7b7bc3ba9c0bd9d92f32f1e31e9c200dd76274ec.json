You're right.\n\n\"We live high carbon lives and the industries that we are part of have huge carbon footprints.\n\n\"Like you, and everyone else, we are stuck in this fossil-fuel economy and without systemic change, our lifestyles will keep on causing climate and ecological harm.\"\n\nThey said they can't ignore the call of young people like Greta Thunberg to \"fight for their already devastated future\", even if it means they themselves are \"in your firing line\".\n\nThe letter continues: \"Life on earth is dying. We are living in the midst of the 6 mass extinction.\"\n\nIt ends: \"We invite all people with platforms and profiles to join us and move beyond fear, to use your voices fearlessly to amplify the real story.\n\n(Image: xr_Richmond/Twitter)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\"Thousands of ordinary people are risking their freedom by taking part in non-violent civil disobedience.\n\n\"We've been inspired by their courage to speak out and join them.
