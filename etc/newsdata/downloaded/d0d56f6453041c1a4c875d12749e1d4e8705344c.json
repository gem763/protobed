She said that a family dog, which she called a \"shepard\" without specifying the breed, was able to find her.\n\nNeighbors came to help lift the roof off of Angela once there was a break in the storm, Sandra said, and took her to their house.\n\n\"Today was the first day we've been able to get her out,\" she told the Bahamas Press. \"She can't walk.\"\n\nAngela was reunited with her family on Wednesday after a private helicopter transported her to Nassau to meet up with her sister-in-law.\n\nRead More: Before-and-after images show how Hurricane Dorian's storm surge put a Bahamas airport underwater.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Sandra is the founder of a local aid group called Restoration Abaco, which has partnered with international aid group Project Hope.\n\nSandra Cooke, founder of the local aid group Restoration Abaco, retold her survival story to CBS News. Screenshot/CBS News\n\nThe group has asked on its Facebook page for people to donate bottled water, canned goods, and hygiene products.\n\nDorian hit the Bahamas as a Category 5 storm on Sunday, with sustained wind speeds of 185 mph and brought with it a storm surge that reached as high as 23 feet in some parts of the island.\n\nIt tied the record for the strongest Atlantic hurricane landfall ever, battering the Caribbean nation for three days with strong winds and heavy rains that caused flooding so catastrophic that the runway of the main airport in the Bahamas was left completely underwater.\n\nPart of the reason the destruction on the island was so devastating was that the storm completely stalled over the Bahamas, pummeling it with devastating hurricane conditions for almost two full days. The storm has caused the deaths of at least 30 people in the Bahamas.", "description": "Sandra Cooke, a resident of Nassau, Bahamas, says her family on the Abaco Islands were rescued and transported to safety with the help of their dog.", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d72432c21214c38e71fbf9b-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
