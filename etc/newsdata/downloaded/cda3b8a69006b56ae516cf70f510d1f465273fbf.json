He fouled a ball off the foot on Sept. 4 and had not played since Sept. 11. Initial X-rays were negative, so Tuesday\u2019s announcement was a surprise.\n\nPhiladelphia acquired Dickerson from Pittsburgh on July 31. He hit .304 overall with 12 homers and 59 RBIs, including .293 with eight homers with the Phillies.\n\nRight-hander Edubray Ramos was reinstated from the 60-day IL. He had been out since July 15 with right shoulder impingement.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Philadelphia outfielder Corey Dickerson will not return this season after an injury to his left foot was determined to be a fracture.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/braves_phillies_baseball_99465_c0-146-3483-2176_s1770x1032.jpg?f2e86fd59b3fc295a58637ef7d10e71e33675869", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
