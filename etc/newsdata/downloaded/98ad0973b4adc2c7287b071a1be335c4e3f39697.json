Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who represents the district. In the clip, Warren speaks to community members about residents who have been diagnosed with cancer linked to exposure to toxins after years of living in the shadow of a massive oil refinery.\n\nWARREN FACING SCRUTINY OVER CLAIM SHE WAS FIRED FOR BEING PREGNANT\n\nIn line with her overarching campaign to end corruption in Washington, Warren calls the pollution in these communities a result of \u201cdecades of discrimination and environmental racism,\u201d saying it is \u201cunacceptable and it must change.\u201d\n\nThe plan, which has been posted to her website, builds upon policies covering everything from affordable housing to green manufacturing to clean energy. She stresses the need to build \u201cstrong, resilient communities\u201d by doing more than just \u201ccleaning up polluted neighborhoods and tweaking a few regulations at the EPA.\u201d\n\nAccording to the campaign, this would mean identifying the most at-risk communities and requiring all federal agencies to consider the climate impact of any proposed projects. Warren also calls for investing in the nation\u2019s public water systems, ending the privatization of those systems and enforcing water quality standards.\n\nThe plan is vague on how exactly the $1 trillion would be spent, but also calls for grants to long-term residents of \"redlined\" communities that were once discriminated against financially \"so that they can buy homes in the neighborhood of their choice and start to build wealth.\"\n\nWarren's plan is one of many multitrillion-dollar commitments from the Democratic field that have raised questions over how they would be funded. Her climate policy claims that an added corporate profit tax, as well as reversing part of the Trump administration's tax cuts, would finance the programs.\n\nWARREN SLIPS AHEAD OF BIDEN IN LATEST POLL\n\nWarren also vows to get tough on polluting companies. This includes reinstituting the Superfund Waste Tax, which ensures hazardous waste sites are properly cleaned up and expired in 1995. \u201cPolluters must pay for the consequences of their actions \u2014 not leave them for the communities to clean up. I\u2019ll work with Congress to reinstate and then triple the Superfund tax, generating needed revenue to clean up the mess,\u201d she says.\n\nWarren\u2019s environmental justice policy comes ahead of a campaign swing through South Carolina, California, and Nevada later in the week.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren announced a plan Wednesday to send at least $1 trillion \u2013\u00a0of her $3 trillion climate plan \u2013\u00a0to communities hit hard by industrial pollution, particularly low-income areas and communities of color.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/09/694940094001_6093376613001_6093376446001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
