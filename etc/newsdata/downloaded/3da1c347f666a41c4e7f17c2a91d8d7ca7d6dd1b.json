At least 30 people were killed in the Philippines last year, following 48 in 2017, dislodging Brazil from the top spot for the first time since the independent watchdog Global Witness began monitoring in 2012.\n\nIn Palawan, illegal logging is the dark side of the tourism boom as the island province rushes to construct hotels and resorts. At least 12 local environmentalists have been murdered since 2004, including Ruben Arzaga, the head of El Nido village, who was shot in September 2017 by illegal loggers.\n\nGlobal Witness said the threat against defenders in Palawan has escalated with Duterte\u2019s brutal campaign against illegal drugs. Some environmental activists have been named on a list of \u201cnarco-politicians\u201d created by Duterte\u2019s administration.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ruben Arzaga (L), who was shot dead by illegal loggers in September 2017.

Many deaths involve armed men on motorcycles, the same modus operandi employed in the war on drugs.\n\nGlobal Witness said the militarisation of communities due to the declaration of martial law in Mindanao has also increased the danger for local land defenders. Almost half of the murders since Duterte assumed the presidency have taken place in the region.\n\n\u201cThe imposition of martial law on the island of Mindanao has empowered an army already known for protecting business projects and attacking those who oppose them,\u201d the report said.\n\nGlobal Witness said violence had got worse as the government continued to attract more investment into the region. Members of the army and paramilitaries are the suspects in almost three-quarters of the murders.\n\nDuterte declared martial law during the 2017 siege of Marawi City by supporters of Islamic State. He kept extending it despite the end of the crisis, citing the need to eliminate terrorist cells operating in other parts of Mindanao.\n\nGlobal Witness said martial law was also used for the purposes of the military\u2019s drive against the communist New People\u2019s Army (NPA), which \u201cmay be operating in and around some of the rural communities opposed to abusive business projects\u201d.\n\nThe research cited the 2017 massacre of eight indigenous activists opposing a coffee plantation on their ancestral land in south Mindanao. The military claimed they were communist rebels killed in a legitimate encounter, but the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) disagreed and held two military commanders liable for the killings.\n\nThe Philippines has laws in place to protect and uphold the right of communities to decide how their land and resources are used, but natural resources are often found in ancestral lands and indigenous peoples are frequently shortchanged or excluded in consultation processes. Conflicts then erupt between locals and intruding investors.\n\nThe report also criticised funders such as the World Bank\u2019s International Finance Corporation, Standard Chartered and Mizuho Bank for financing projects and dealing with corporations linked to violence. It also called out countries such as the US for assisting the Philippine military, the UK for failing to insert a human rights element into its trade policy, and the EU for providing financial support to projects with human rights risks.\n\nThe report, which serves as a midterm assessment of the Duterte government, called on the populist leader to take action against the killings in the remaining years of his presidency.\n\n\u201cLand and environmental activists will only be able to carry out their activism safely when Duterte\u2019s government and those doing business in the Philippines take action \u2013 as international law requires them to \u2013 to prevent land rights and environmental abuses, protect defenders at risk, and hold the perpetrators of intimidation and violence to account,\u201d the report said.\n\nHowever, the Philippine government dismissed the report. \u201cThe palace considers the UK-based group Global Witness as a purveyor of falsity and a subservient machinery for political propaganda,\u201d a spokesman for Duterte said.\n\nThe CHR chair, Chito Gascon, confirmed attacks on environmental defenders were continuing. \u201cIt is unfortunate that rampant violence and criminal activity have gone unabated over several years, exacerbating a climate of impunity and injustice in this country. The [Global Witness] report focused on attacks on environmentalists and land rights advocates which is one of the several areas where the violence continues,\u201d Gascon said.\n\n\u201cWe call on law enforcement to do everything to end this violence and hold perpetrators to account.\u201d", "description": "Study shows martial law in an island territory is also being used as pretext for violence", "authors": ["Carmela Fonbuena"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e99a2bda48c3e67eee2e3137bd3e8a450e6484b5/0_125_4584_2749/master/4584.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f566c5999b4ac28f34d26bd1a3c99780", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
