She has publicly accused Rebekah Vardy, the wife of fellow England footballer Jamie Vardy, of being the individual who was leaking the private information.\n\nVardy has denied any involvement and suggested someone else may have had access to the password for her Instagram account. The Sun has yet to comment, although one of the stories, billed as an exclusive, appears to have already been pulled from the newspaper\u2019s website.\n\nRooney said in a statement: \u201cFor a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing the Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories. There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family \u2013 all without my permission or knowledge.\n\n\u201cAfter a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion. To try and prove this I came with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except one account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\n\nColeen Rooney (@ColeenRoo) This has been a burden in my life for a few years now and finally I have got to the bottom of it...... pic.twitter.com/0YqJAoXuK1\n\n\u201cOver the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know from certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\n\u201cI have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s \u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u201d\n\nIn response, Vardy said she had never spoken to journalists about Rooney, even though many had called her.\n\nShe also appeared to imply that her Instagram account may have been improperly accessed by a third party: \u201cIf you thought this was happening you could have told me and I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.\n\n\u201cOver the years various people have had access to my Insta and just this week I found I was following people I didn\u2019t know and have never followed myself. I\u2019m not being funny but I don\u2019t need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you? I liked you a lot Coleen and I\u2019m so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I\u2019m heavily pregnant. I\u2019m disgusted that I\u2019m even having to deny this.\u201d\n\nThe claims come at an awkward time for the Sun, which is already facing a legal case from Prince Harry against its publisher, News Group Newspapers, for alleged phone hacking. It has also had to deal with a hefty pushback against its decision to investigate the family background of the England cricketer Ben Stokes.", "description": "Wife of Wayne Rooney claims fellow footballer\u2019s wife passed on her private Instagram posts", "authors": ["Jim Waterson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2202cbac312519259e2b06fbc10908b094caea5/0_95_2966_1780/master/2966.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=52aabc43c8573204f77ab1d19d4a234e", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
