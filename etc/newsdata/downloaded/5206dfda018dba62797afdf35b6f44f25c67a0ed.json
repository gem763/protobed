Our testers enjoyed playing as each famous pup and the adventures were an achievable challenge for even the youngest of players, although older gamers may lose interest quicker.\n\nIt's only a one-player game and some testers felt it would have been great to have a two player option. It's a lovely family friendly game though, that held the attention of children for a long time and kept them smiling.\n\nMFM tester, Jasmin, mum to Mckenzie, nine, says: 'It's exactly like the TV show and my son loved being part of the story \u2013 he was interested and excited the whole time he was playing.'\n\nAvailable from: Game, Amazon and Argos\n\nBEST ACTIVITY MAT\n\nTaf Toys All Around Me Gym, \u00a369.99\n\nPictured, best activity mat: Taf Toys All Around Me Gym is suitable for newborns and available from Amazon\n\nAge: From birth\n\nWhat it is: This padded baby mat (90cm in diameter) has music, lights and 14 developmental activities - like music, hanging toys and lights, a mobile that can also attach to your baby's cot, a mirror, a teether, and a rotating pinwheel.

And its large - my six-month-old had plenty of room.'\n\nAimee, MFM tester and mum to Penelope, age four months, says: 'It was easy to assemble and I like that there are plenty of loops to hang the toys from so there is some variety to using it.

It is the first thing she'd choose if she had money to spend. And, with a toy that is as interactive as Cry Babies Kristal, I definitely wouldn't begrudge paying around \u00a350. A doll like this would be a main Christmas present type gift. I find my that my daughter really likes to \"play mummy\" with her dolls, and this adds a little extra to it. Your baby cries, as babies do, and you need to work out why she is sad. Does she need medicine, an injection? Maybe take her temperature and listen to her heartbeat? It adds a caring aspect which is very cute to watch and encourage.'\n\nEmma, mum to Archie, age five, says: 'Who says dolls aren't for boys?! My three-year-old son loved this doll. What I loved most was it also captured the attention of his five-year-old brother \u2013 they loved quickly finding the equipment they needed to help Kristal stop crying. My three-year-old picked her up and sang hush little baby, and also said, \"Look she has tears!\" Easy compartment at the back of the head to fill with water in order for the baby to cry.
