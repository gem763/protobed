So nice to see!\u201d\n\nIn response, Thunberg changed her Twitter bio to read: \u201cA very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.\u201d\n\nThe activist also implored her followers not to waste their time by giving more attention to critics who are \u201cdesperate\u201d to shift the focus from climate change.\n\n\u201cAs you may have noticed, the haters are as active as ever \u2013 going after me, my looks, my clothes, my behaviour and my differences,\u201d she wrote on Instagram and Twitter.\n\n\u201cThey come up with every thinkable lie and conspiracy theory.\n\n\u201cIt seems they will cross every possible line to avert the focus, since they are so desperate not to talk about the climate and ecological crisis.\n\n\"Being different is not an illness and the current, best available science is not opinions \u2013 it\u2019s facts.\n\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t understand why adults would choose to spend their time mocking and threatening teenagers and children for promoting science, when they could do something good instead. I guess they must simply feel so threatened by us.\u201d", "description": "The owner of luxury fashion conglomerate Louis Vuitton Moet\u00a0Hennesey\u00a0(LVMH) has called Greta Thunberg\u00a0\"demoralising\".", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/25/11/greta-thunberg-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
