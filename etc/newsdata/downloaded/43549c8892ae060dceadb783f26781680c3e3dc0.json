Then came the nationally televised debates where Mr. Trudeau abandoned his positive messaging and leveled personal attacks against Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer.\n\nAfter the brownface scandal broke, support for Mr. Trudeau dropped 20 points in four days, said pollster Nik Nanos, chairman of Nanos Research. Although the prime minister\u2019s Liberal Party regained its small lead in the polls, he said, that incident rattled voters and damaged Mr. Trudeau\u2019s brand.\n\nFlare-ups of raw political rage and bigotry against foreigners also have marked this election campaign.\n\nCanadian singer/songwriter Angella Johnson said she has never before encountered the level of uninformed hatred directed at Mr. Trudeau.\n\nPeople have a lack of faith in the system, politicians in general and the government, \u201cbut they don\u2019t know why,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Trudeau\u2019s supporters say that despite the stumbles, he has an impressive four-year record as prime minister.\n\nCanada\u2019s economy has been growing, unemployment and child poverty rates are down, relations with aboriginal people have improved, and the government has moved to preserve sensitive wilderness areas. Despite some tricky ups and downs, Mr. Trudeau successfully concluded a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with the Trump administration and Mexico, and pushed \u2014 unsuccessfully \u2014 to unite environmental, aboriginal and energy industry groups around a plan to build pipelines to ship oil from Alberta to seaports in British Columbia.\n\nFour years ago, Mr. Trudeau was the fresh, youthful face promising to end a decade of Conservative rule. Mr. Scheer, a self-described minivan-driving father of five who is seven years younger than the prime minister, has campaigned as a classic small-government conservative, backing market deregulation, lower taxes and government spending, and supporting the country\u2019s struggling oil and natural gas industries.\n\nHe vows as one of his first acts in office to repeal a carbon tax approved by the Liberals as part of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s agenda to fight climate change.\n\nBut Mr. Scheer has also sharpened his tone in the candidate debates, calling Mr. Trudeau at one point a \u201ccompulsive liar\u201d who does \u201cnot deserve to govern this country.\u201d\n\nMr. Trudeau has responded in kind, while appealing to voters of other leftist and center-left parties, by warning about what he calls going back to the bad old days of Conservative government.\n\n\u201cWe know that the Conservative Party is running one of the dirtiest, nastiest campaigns based on disinformation that we\u2019ve ever seen in this country,\u201d he told a Montreal rally this week. \u201cAnd it\u2019s no surprise that they don\u2019t want to share whose deep pockets are funding their attacks on Canadians, on other parties and on the most important fight of our generation: the fight against climate change.\u201d\n\nAn aggregation of polls this week from the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. gave Mr. Trudeau and the Liberals a 51% chance of either winning outright or being able to create a governing coalition, to 48% for Mr. Scheer\u2019s Conservatives. Both major parties attracted less than a third of the overall vote in the compilation of polls.\n\nVirtue signaling\n\nMr. Trudeau portrays himself as a defender of liberal values such as multiculturalism, support for refugees and women\u2019s rights. But that approach has proved to be a double-edged sword in the nitty-gritty of governing.\n\nPat Gossage, chairman of Media Profile, said Mr. Trudeau\u2019s constant \u201cvirtue signaling\u201d has left him vulnerable to character attacks. Mr. Scheer calls Mr. Trudeau a fraud and reminds his audiences of what he says are the prime minister\u2019s multiple acts of hypocrisy.\n\nHe vacationed on a private island owned by the Aga Khan, spiritual leader of the Ismaili branch of Shiite Islam, and may have discussed business deals with him. A searing scandal involving the government\u2019s attempts to protect a major Quebec construction firm from legal punishment led to the firing of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s highest-profile aboriginal Cabinet minister and the resignation of one of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s closest aides for his role in the scandal.\n\nFurther to the political right, Maxime Bernier, leader of the new People\u2019s Party of Canada, has accused Mr. Trudeau of \u201cradical multiculturalism\u201d and dividing Canada into \u201clittle tribes.\u201d\n\nThe critique of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s all-encompassing liberalism appears to have hit a nerve. Polls show that 70% of Quebecers support a recently enacted law banning the province\u2019s teachers, police and other government employees from wearing visible religious symbols such as the Islamic headscarf, Jewish yarmulke and Sikh turbans.\n\nThe leader of Canada\u2019s leftist New Democratic Party, Jagmeet Singh, a practicing Sikh, is easily identifiable by his uncut beard and turban. While Mr. Singh was campaigning in Montreal, a local man took issue with the NDP leader\u2019s public display of religiosity.\n\n\u201cYou should cut your turban off, and you look like a Canadian,\u201d the man said.\n\nAmrit Kaur, a Sikh woman challenging Quebec\u2019s religious symbols ban, said attacks on people\u2019s religion and personal differences are growing because politicians are stoking anger.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the trickle-down effects of the politics,\u201d she told the Montreal Gazette. \u201cTo some people, no matter how much you integrate, no matter how much you try, you\u2019ll never be Canadian, you\u2019ll never be a Quebecer and you\u2019ll never shed the immigrant label. It\u2019s sad.\u201d\n\nIronically, Mr. Singh\u2019s widely praised performance in the campaign debate of the party leaders is credited with reinvigorating support for the NDP.\n\nMr. Trudeau appears to be a victim of the high hopes and soaring expectations that greeted his victory in 2015. He became a social media star, sparking envy from President Obama for his dark styled hair and attracting meme-worthy appraising side glances from first daughter Ivanka Trump on a February 2017 White House visit.\n\nNick Kouvalis, principal strategist of Campaign Research, said Mr. Trudeau has disappointed a lot of people. They think he is a hypocrite who \u201ccomes clean [only] when he\u2019s caught and has never had to own up to the consequences.\u201d\n\nThe campaign has featured a worrying dynamic for the Liberals, Mr. Kouvalis said. Party stalwarts appear less committed to Mr. Trudeau even as polls show Mr. Scheer gaining support among Conservatives.\n\nIn the first poll taken after Mr. Trudeau was sworn in as prime minister, more than 60% of Canadians approved of him. In the most recent Campaign Research poll, 54% of Canadians said they disapproved of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s job performance.\n\nAnalysts still give the nod to Mr. Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party to win the election Monday even if they get fewer votes than the Conservatives. This is because the Canadian Parliament is set up like the House of Representatives, with more populous provinces electing more representatives. Conservative support is heavily concentrated in Canada\u2019s western provinces, and Mr. Trudeau\u2019s Liberals are ahead in Ontario and Quebec. Together, those two provinces elect more than two-thirds of the representatives in Parliament.\n\nIf the Liberals lose their majority, then Mr. Trudeau will need the support of other parties to continue governing. Mr. Trudeau\u2019s father, former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, faced that same situation in 1972 and governed for the next two years with help from the NDP.\n\nBut the elections could end in an upset if the Conservatives and the separatist Bloc Quebecois win enough seats to challenge the Liberals as a governing alliance.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
