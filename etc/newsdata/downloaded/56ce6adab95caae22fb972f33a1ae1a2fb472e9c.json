It's such a fundamental red line to cross. There is an issue of respect for the athletes. How do they feel having trained all their lives for this? Clearly something has gone very wrong. For an Olympics, expectation would probably be now that you would see one or other Middle East country coming forward before Qatar.\"\n\nEven for the women's 100m final, attendance levels hardly increased Credit: GETTY IMAGES\n\nThe athletics had sent a \"very negative signal as to Doha's ability to host any major event\", Payne added. Qatar was controversially awarded football's 2022 World Cup, but FIFA insists there is enough local interest across the region to ensure any local allocations of tickets sell out.\n\nOn Sunday night Denise Lewis was among leading figures in athletics to criticise organisers after eventual silver medalist Dina Asher-Smith ran sprint finals in front of rows of empty seats in the 40,000-capacity stadium. Payne, who now works as a consultant strategic adviser, said the athletics had illustrated the dangers of building \"empty cathedrals\".\n\nStory continues\n\nHe added. \"You can build the greatest stadiums, you can have unlimited budgets to do incredible ceremonies and make it all work, but you do need to have to people in the stadium,\" he said. \"I think it is incomprehensible for athletes in any sport to compete in their world championships in front of an empty stadium.\n\n\"It sends a terrible image and I'm sure the television ratings will be negatively impacted. At the end of the day, what's the point of building big stadiums for the people in the country - it's an empty cathedral.\"\n\nSpeaking on the BBC, 2000 Olympic heptathlon champion Lewis said the IAAF has \"let down\" the athletes competing in the Qatar capital city. \"I can't deny, I walked into the stadium and thought 'is this the World Championships?'' Lewis said.\n\nIn December, Liverpool will travel to Qatar for the Fifa Club World Cup. The new Education City Stadium in Doha will host Liverpool's semi-final on the 18th - the same date as the final of the next World Cup due to the oppressive summer heat.\n\nJurgen Klopp's Premier League leaders automatically go into a semi-final where they could play local side Al Sadd, managed by Spain great Xavi, Hienghene Sport of New Caledonia or Mexican side Monterrey.", "description": "The empty Doha stadium at the World Athletics Championships has scuppered Qatar's chances of landing an Olympic Games for at least 20 years, bidding experts believe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/AjUJmpLBrcDPRRJRLtL6gA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0pjXTqOBZVTQU0LjD0aZaw--~B/aD0xNTM4O3c9MjQ2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/7a170f8c287f153773ddeb3a5a0bc32c", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
