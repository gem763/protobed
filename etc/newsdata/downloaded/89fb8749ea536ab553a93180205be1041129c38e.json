Joe Biden\u2019s eye filled with blood while onstage at the CNN town hall.\n\nThis is not a photoshop: pic.twitter.com/kJRHxMP8wc \u2014 Benny (@bennyjohnson) September 5, 2019\n\nIt was even at the top of the Drudge Report.\n\nA burst blood vessel in the eye was not the only reason people were talking about Biden on Wednesday, however. Many took aim at his performance, which was full of vague responses intermixed with incoherent statements.\n\n.@JoeBiden's answer on fracking was a rambling incoherent mess. Honestly, the more he talks, the more it is clear he is declining cognitively rapidly. It's irresponsible of the Democratic Party and media to pretend these are \"gaffes.\" He is not well #ClimateTownHall \u2014 Jordan (@JordanChariton) September 5, 2019\n\nJoe Biden is really struggs to func at this climate town hall \u2014 Annie Shields (@anastasiakeeley) September 5, 2019\n\nGuy's seriously, Joe is just...saying nothing. This is so strange. #ClimateTownHall \u2014 Kira (@RealKiraDavis) September 5, 2019\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s entire political persona these days is just loudly and emphatically asking \u201cwhat the hell are we doing here?!\u201d and \u201cwhat\u2019s going on?!!\u201d with zero solutions. #ClimateTownHall \u2014 Emma Vigeland (@EmmaVigeland) September 5, 2019\n\nAbsolutely the best 30 seconds of the CNN Climate town hall.\n\nA must watch.\n\nSo beautiful.\n\nThis is art.\n\nNever change, Joepic.twitter.com/n5CYwlinnq \u2014 Benny (@bennyjohnson) September 5, 2019\n\nIt's time for Biden to hang it up pic.twitter.com/iv8bmjVqaQ \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) September 5, 2019\n\nIt's time for Biden to hang it up pic.twitter.com/iv8bmjVqaQ \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) September 5, 2019", "description": ".09/06/2019 8:08:53AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/238/cb6dab6e-e3c1-4399-a093-14bfc30b83ac.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
