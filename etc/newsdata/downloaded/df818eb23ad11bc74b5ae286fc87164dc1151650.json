It has also filed a patent related to the technology in July.\n\nWarming up to crypto?\n\nDespite its size, the bank has traditionally been hostile to cryptocurrency, blocking account holders from completing transactions in previous years.\n\nThat perspective seemed to get overhauled in 2019. As Cointelegraph reported, BoA submitted a patent for a digital currency wallet in August. It also joined R3\u2019s Marco Polo blockchain trade platform in September.\n\nThe treasury product manager candidate, meanwhile, must have experience in the payments sector, but cryptocurrency knowledge is not a specific requirement, according to the posting.", "description": "America\u2019s second largest banking institution searches for a \u201ctreasury product manager\u201d specifically working with Ripple\u2019s technology", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvM2EwZmMwZDdlODVkMGI3NzBkMjNmNDFmOWRjZDM4N2UuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
