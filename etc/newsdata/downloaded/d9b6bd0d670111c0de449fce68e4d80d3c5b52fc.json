In 2018, Poland agreed to buy 20 High Mobility Artillery Rocket launchers for $414 million and signed a $4.7 billion deal for the Patriot missile system, the largest arms deal in its history, according to Breaking Defense.\n\nUnder President Donald Trump, the United States has rolled out a \"Buy American\" plan that relaxed restrictions on sales and encouraged US officials to take a bigger role in increasing business overseas for the American weapons industry.\n\nHowever, the US began the process in April to remove Turkey from the multinational F-35 program after Ankara said it would proceed in purchasing a Russian S-400 missile-defense system that NATO officials say is not compatible with the F-35.\n\nCongress was notified of the State Department's approval on Tuesday, a State Department official said.\n\n(Reporting by Bryan Pietsch, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien and Jonathan Oatis)", "description": "The State Department said on Wednesday it had approved a proposed sale of 32 Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets, worth $6.5 billion, to Poland.", "authors": ["Bryan Pietsch"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d79521a2e22af04463f6e75-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
