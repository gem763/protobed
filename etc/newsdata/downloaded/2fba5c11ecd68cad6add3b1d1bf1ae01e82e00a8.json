Photo-Illustration: by Stevie Remsberg\n\nThis week\u2019s episode of The Cut on Tuesdays is all about anxiety. We heard from our friends and co-workers about what\u2019s going through their heads when they freak out, and talked to women like comedian Aparna Nancherla, artist Jenny Odell, and writer Sarah Wilson about how to understand anxiety better.\n\nWe also asked our listeners to tell us about their private coping strategies \u2014 the stuff that\u2019s not therapy or medication, but still scratches that mental itch. Here\u2019s some of what they had to say.\n\n\u201cThis is a little embarrassing, but I tend to physically just go to the container store. I can\u2019t really explain it, but there\u2019s something about seeing something where everything has a place, and there\u2019s organization for things you\u2019ve never thought of. I feel like when I walk in there, I have somewhat of a spiritual experience and end up blacking out and coming out with things like battery organizers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI make chicken soup. Peeling carrots really does it for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like to consume a lot of caffeine when I am really anxious, which a lot of times makes me more anxious. But I feel like that justifies the anxiety. And like, \u2018Oh, this isn\u2019t a mental disorder. I\u2019ve just had too much caffeine. It\u2019s fine.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m a first-time mom. I have a 9-month-old daughter. And \u2026 when I am anxious about myself, I do something for her. Like, I have so much laundry to do, but I\u2019ll do hers first. And I will organize her stuff. If she\u2019s set, that means I can also take care of myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way I self-soothe is by watching pimple-popping videos. But they have to be ones like from a doctor\u2019s office with good lighting. I don\u2019t really like the sketchy home ones. So, like Dr Pimple Popper. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s like the pent-up anxiety is similar to a pimple and then the release when you pop it is like it\u2019s going away. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d\n\nClick above to hear more, and subscribe wherever you listen.", "description": "This week\u2019s episode of The Cut on Tuesdays is all about anxiety.
