Yet he allowed the worst culprits of dirty play to escape with just yellow cards.\n\nHe flashed five cautions in the opening half \u2013 and 12 in total \u2013 six to either side.\n\nChiefs were forced to make two substitutions in a space of 10 minutes in the first half when Bernard Parker and Kearyn Baccus limped off.\n\nEven the introduction of Nurkovic for Parker as well as that of George Maluleka for Baccus did not help take the game from City, who clearly had done their homework thoroughly on the same opponents who beat them 2-1 in a league clash in August.\n\nLike in the previous encounter, City went pressing from the onset and did not allow Chiefs much time on the ball to impose their own game plan.\n\nErasmus, one of the scorers in the last meeting, was again in his element and the Bafana Bafana striker underlined his quality with the control and the subsequent shot that beat Daniel Akpeyi from long range. The Nigerian international goalie was called into action again in the second half as he produced double saves against Erasmus.\n\nChiefs had their snap attempts at goal, notably Dumisani Zuma\u2019s long range strike that got the best out of Leeuwenburgh in the City goal.\n\nBut Chiefs soon found their way back into the game when Nurkovic equalised six minutes from regulation time.\n\nNext up, Chiefs will attempt to consolidate their four-point lead in the league race when they travel to Pretoria to face defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns on Sunday. \u2013 Own Correspondent\n\nOther Telkom Knockout Last 16 results Saturday\n\nGolden Arrows 1-0 Polokwane City Friday Maritzburg United 1-1 Bidvest Wits (Maritzburg won 3-1 on penalties)\n\n\n\n", "description": "Cape Town City (1) 1.", "authors": ["Staff Reporter"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9494/a8eb140b52a64a95875ba4bae1722752.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
