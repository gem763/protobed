(AP) \u2014 Hurricane Dorian howled over North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks on Friday \u2014 a much weaker but still dangerous version of the storm that wreaked havoc in the Bahamas \u2014 flooding homes in the low-lying ribbon of islands and throwing a scare into year-round residents who tried to tough it out.\n\nIts winds down to 90 mph (145 kph), the Category 1 hurricane lashed communities with wind, rain and floodwaters as it hugged the islands. Around midmorning, it blew ashore at Cape Hatteras, making its first landfall on the U.S. mainland.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad,\u201d Ann Warner, who owns Howard\u2019s Pub on Ocracoke Island, said by telephone. \u201cThe water came up to the inside of our bottom floor, which has never had water.\u201d She said a skylight blew out and whitecaps coursed through her front yard and underneath her elevated house.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re safe,\u201d Warner added. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly a mess.\u201d\n\nAnother Ocracoke Island resident, bookshop owner Leslie Lanier, texted: \u201cWe are flooding like crazy. It is in the houses, and there will be more before it stops.\u201d\n\n\u201cLots of people are getting water starting in their homes,\u201d Lanier added. \u201cI have been here 32 years and not seen this.\u201d\n\nAs of 9 a.m. EDT, Dorian was moving northeast at 14 mph (22 kph). It is expected to remain a hurricane as it sweeps up the Eastern Seaboard on Friday and Saturday, far enough offshore that its hurricane-force winds are unlikely to reach land.\n\nMore than 370,000 people were without electricity in the Carolinas and Virginia as Dorian moved up the coast.\n\nAt least four people were killed in the Southeast. All were men in Florida or North Carolina who died in falls or by electrocution while trimming trees, putting up storm shutters or otherwise getting ready for the hurricane.\n\nOn the Outer Banks, forecasters said large and destructive waves could reach nearly to the ceilings of one-story structures along the 200-mile (320-kilometer) string of islands.\n\n\u201cDo not let your guard down,\u201d Dare County emergency managers warned people who insisted on riding out the storm.\n\nAs Dorian closed in, many people on the Outer Banks tied down their boats, removed objects from their yards that could blow away, and hunkered down. Warner said about half the 1,000 residents of Ocracoke stuck it out.\n\nAt the start of the week, Dorian slammed the Bahamas with 185 mph (295 kph) winds, killing at least 30 people and obliterating countless homes. From there, it swept past Florida and Georgia at a relatively safe distance, then sideswiped the Carolinas on Thursday, spinning off tornadoes that peeled away roofs and flipped recreational vehicles.\n\nStill, the damage was far less than feared in many parts of the Carolinas, including historic Charleston, South Carolina, which is prone to flooding even from ordinary storms, and Wilmington, North Carolina, the state\u2019s biggest coastal city.\n\n\u201cWe prepared for the worst and that didn\u2019t happen. That\u2019s OK. I was a little worried back when it was a Category 3. We got lucky,\u201d said Ross Page, who walked his dogs in downtown Wilmington on Friday morning.\n\nJoseph Pawlick went out to rake leaves, twigs and other debris blown from the sidewalk outside his downtown Wilmington home. \u201cI slept like a baby last night. This, thankfully, was not bad,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Meg Kinnard in Charleston, South Carolina; Russ Bynum in Tybee Island, Georgia; Skip Foreman in Charlotte, North Carolina; Gary Robertson in Raleigh, North Carolina; Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Alabama; Ben Finley in Norfolk, Virginia; Jeff Martin in Atlanta; Seth Borenstein in Washington; and David Koenig in Dallas contributed to this report.", "description": "Weakened to a Category 1 hurricane, the powerful storm lashed communities with wind, rain and floodwaters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d725def240000621c77ba5e.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
