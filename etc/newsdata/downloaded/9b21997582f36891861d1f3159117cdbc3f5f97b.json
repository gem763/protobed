Attackers often use these services to host malware, linking to the malicious files in a URL.\u201d\n\nJust as malware and ransomware attacks are exposing sensitive data and preventing access to medical care, Proofpoint\u2019s research highlights the need for securing hospital networks from malicious intrusions.\n\nThe rise of targeting phishing campaigns\n\nThe threats come in all forms, ranging from backdoors, credential stealers to targeted phishing campaigns aimed at \u201cvery attacked people\u201d \u2014 including those who have public-facing contact details such as email addresses \u2014 that leave the door open for threat actors to access critical information.\n\nEmotet, a botnet-driven spam campaign, emerged as the biggest source of malware, morphing from its original roots as a banking Trojan to a \u201cSwiss Army knife\u201d that can serve as a downloader, information stealer, and spambot depending on how it\u2019s deployed.\n\nRansomware threats, on the other hand, have fallen off from their 2017 highs, the report stated, citing volatility of the cryptocurrency market \u2014 which has become criminals\u2019 preferred mode of payment in recent years \u2014 and increased security posture of organizations in response to such threats.\n\nNotably, none of the 22 agencies involved in the Texas coordinated ransomware attack in August ended up paying the ransom despite the attackers demanding a collective $2.5 million from the agencies.\n\n\u201cThe threat landscape is evolving to more carefully selected targets who have insurance and are likely to pay out,\u201d Ryan Kalember, who leads cybersecurity strategy for Proofpoint, told TNW in a previous interaction.\n\nCredit: Proofpoint US\n\nPhishing messages, the other means of malware delivery, were found to masquerade as alerts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), increasing the likelihood that healthcare workers would open them right away.\n\nUpon opening, the message triggered the installation of GandCrab ransomware, thereby encrypting important files in the system and asking for a ransom to decrypt them.\n\nAlthough the operators behind the malware announced they were retiring in June, Secureworks Counter Threat Unit uncovered overlaps between GandCrab and a new form of ransomware called REvil (aka Sodinokibi). The connections were proved by McAfee last week in what the company says was a careful decision to retire GandCrab, in favor of REvil, to further the ransomware as a service (RaaS) offering.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that REvil was the ransomware strain used in the attack on Texas municipalities as well as the onslaught against hundreds of dental offices in the US by compromising a third-party software vendor.\n\nOther times, the impostor emails featured \u201cpayment\u201d and \u201curgent\u201d in the subject lines to grab attention, adding \u201cthe average impostor attack spoofed (posed as) 15 healthcare staff members on average across multiple messages.\u201d\n\nThe need for improving security posture\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that hackers are constantly finding new ways to trick consumers into providing remote access to their computers in order to steal information. By combining sophisticated social engineering techniques with information already available about the target from other sources, the attacks have proven to be an easy vector to bypass security barriers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in a hyperconnected environment and healthcare systems are extremely prone to attacks,\u201d Jonathan Langer, CEO of medical IoT platform Medigate, told TNW. \u201cThis necessitates hospitals to reassess their security infrastructure and design policies in order to address the security needs early on.\u201d\n\nCalling for a \u201cpeople-centered approach to security,\u201d the research recommends healthcare organizations to adopt security practices that takes into account the individual risk each user represents, including \u201chow they\u2019re targeted, what data they have access to, and whether they tend to fall prey to attacks.\u201d\n\nThis also underscores the need for stopping social engineering attempts from reaching their targets\u2019 inboxes and training people to spot mails that get through.\n\nThe fact that a market for medical data exists should incentivize healthcare institutions to invest more in data backups and auditing their security practices regularly; this would ensure critical systems aren\u2019t open to abuse by threat actors.\n\n\u201cSegmentation based on digital assets is the key to combat cyber threats in hospitals, as is network isolation,\u201d Langer told TNW. \u201cWith more medical devices connected to networks, it\u2019s not just about protecting clinical data. It\u2019s also about patient safety.\u201d\n\nRead next: Google will reportedly reveal a 5G Pixel 4 next week", "description": "", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F07%2Fhealthcare-data-hed.png&signature=0a8b49e26b1551fbd37eedd111d313d6", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
