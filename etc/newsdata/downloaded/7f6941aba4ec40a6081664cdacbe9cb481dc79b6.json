So after seeing a few people sticking Lego bases to various tables I wanted to come up with a table that was functional but also had storage.\u2019\n\nAfter Amanda\u2019s husband was made redundant in May, she didn\u2019t have a lot of money to spend, so went on the hunt for inspiration at budget stores such as IKEA to make her DIY table.\n\nNow Brodie has somewhere to stoy his favourite toys (Picture: Amanda Murray)\n\n\u2018From Ikea I bought the white Lack side table for \u00a36, a Sunnersta rail at \u00a31.50, three Sunnersta containers at 50p each and a Trofast storage tray at \u00a31.50,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018I also bought a Lego base plate for \u00a33.99 from Home Bargains, and finally I took the Trofast green storage tray to my local Screwfix who then helped me pick some PVC U-shaped rails I got for \u00a31.20 which can be cut to size. In total, I spent \u00a315.69 to build this.\u2019\n\nOnce Amanda had all her supplies, she needed to go about building the nifty table.\n\nAmanda\u2019s post received hundreds of likes on Facebook (Picture: Amanda Murray)\n\n\u2018The first thing I did was to attach the rails on the underside of the table for the tray to go on underneath,\u201d Amanda explained.\n\n\u2018I cut the PVC to size and attached with screws. The green Trofast tray then just slides on like a drawer. I then popped the table legs on and went ahead and screwed the rail onto the side of the table. The containers simply hook onto the rail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Finally, I took some Gorilla Glue and glued the Lego base to the middle of the table. I used a damp cloth to wipe off the excess round the side that spilt out and left it overnight to dry.\u2019\n\nA similar table on Amazon costs \u00a3416.94, meaning she saved \u00a3400.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Brodie absolutely loved his new Lego table.\n\nAmanda says: \u2018He plays with the table every day. He got lots of Lego from family and friends for his birthday and so was over the moon to find he had a new table especially for it to play on.\n\n\u2018My tips for people wanting to create something similar would be not to doubt yourself that you won\u2019t manage because you really can. For something that costs so little, this will last a long time and the child can grow with it.\u2019\n\nMORE: Coffee lovers assemble as Nespresso launches its first-ever advent calendar\n\nMORE: Plus-sized woman sick of having to prove her husband doesn\u2019t have a fat fetish\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Forget buying specially made LEGO play tables, and take this Scottish mum's idea to build your own for a fraction of the price.", "authors": ["Jessica Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_92165144_1572021258.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
