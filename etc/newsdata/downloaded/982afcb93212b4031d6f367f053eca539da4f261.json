The working group is expected to provide updated recommendations to the Board of Governors in April. The board also said the divisions can begin making any new rules immediately but no later than January 2021 - two years before a California law clearing the way for athlete endorsement deals takes effect.\n\nWHY NOW?\n\nNCAA membership determined that exploring this issue was an important step to support its athletes. NCAA leadership also determined a response was needed to federal and state legislative proposals \u201cthat would be harmful to a national, uniform college athletics model.\u201d\n\nWHAT ABOUT THAT CALIFORNIA LAW?\n\nThe NCAA said \u201cit is critical that college sports are regulated at a national level.\u201d The nation\u2019s largest governing body for college athletics contends the California law and similar proposals in other states \u201cultimately would lead to pay for play and turn college athletes into employees,\u201d blowing up the very \u201cmission of college sports within higher education.\u201d\n\nWILL THE NCAA GO TO COURT?\n\nThe NCAA contends the California law \u201clikely is unconstitutional, and the actions proposed by other states make clear the harmful impact of disparate sets of state laws.\u201d The NCAA said all potential next steps are on the table.\n\n___\n\nMore details from NCAA: http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/board-governors-starts-process-enhance-name-image-and-likeness-opportunities\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The NCAA Board of Governors has voted unanimously to allow amateur athletes to cash in on their name, image and likeness \"in a manner consistent with the collegiate model.\" The board's principles and guidelines include:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
