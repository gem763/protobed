In this simple confusion of terms, you would be excusably but insurmountably wrong, argues Elon Musk in a recent court filing.\n\nThis bit of linguistic contortionist is just the latest ridiculous twist in a long-running defamation suit which began when Musk suffered the public humiliation of building a non-viable and unasked-for miniature submarine to rescue a children\u2019s soccer team that had become trapped in a cave in Thailand last summer.\n\nA British ex-pat diver, Vern Unsworth, both assisted in the actual extrication of the kids and assisted in publicly telling Musk to fuck himself for turning a difficult mission into a PR stunt; Musk, using the same poor Twitter judgment that cost him millions in SEC fines, called Unsworth a \u201cpedo guy.\u201d The rest is history. Well, history and an ongoing defamation lawsuit.\n\nIn fairness to Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO is by far the single individual most closely associated with the phrase \u201cpedo guy\u201d at this point, lending him a certain expertise in the matter. As it relates to Unsworth\u2019s lawsuit against him, Musk argued that \u201c\u2018Pedo guy\u2019 was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up [...] synonymous with \u2018creepy old man\u2019 and is used to insult a person\u2019s appearance and demeanour.\u201d You know, the way people say \u201cmurderer\u201d or \u201crapist\u201d to mean \u201ca rude person I find disagreeable.\u201d\n\nI have not personally been to South Africa or know much about its colloquialisms in the 1970s when a young Musk would have been reared there. What does seem quite apparent is that this appeal towards a softer definition of the easily-grasped term \u201cpedophile\u201d is contradicted by Musk\u2019s other statements.\n\nSpecifically, by emails with Buzzfeed reporter Ryan Mac, which Musk unilaterally claimed were \u201coff the record,\u201d where the CEO told the reporter that he should \u201cstop defending child rapists.\u201d\n\nThe filings also reveal Musk hired a private investigator to look into Unsworth\u2019s background, which might be troubling in itself, although Musk\u2019s remarks do not make clear what definition of \u201cprivate investigator\u201d he\u2019s operating under.\n\nSeemingly not the one that means \u201ca person who uncovers factual information about another person or group in exchange for money,\u201d because Musk states the investigator he retained \u2014 a Mr. Jared Birchall \u2014 had reported Unsworth moved to Thailand to wed a woman who was 12 years of age. At some later date, Musk appears to have learned Birchall\u2019s findings were false.\n\nSo to summarise:\n\nElon Musk referred to a guy as a \u201cpedo\u201d (a creepy old man who does not have sex with children, according to Musk\u2019s definition). At the very least, he later appeared to believe the man was a pedophile (someone is attracted to or has sex with children). He then found out the guy he accused of being a pedophile (ibid) in an email to a reporter was, instead, just a diver living in Thailand.\n\nThe lawyers certainly have their work cut out for them.", "description": "It\u2019s a common misconception that words have meaning \u2014 specifically that \u201cpedo guy,\u201d for all intents and purposes, would refer to a man (guy) who harbours or acts on sexual attraction towards children (pedophile.)
