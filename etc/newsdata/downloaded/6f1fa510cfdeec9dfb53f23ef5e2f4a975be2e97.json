Be it a panel collapsing inward after slipping off a rib, a failed spring mechanism that won\u2019t properly open or close the canopy, or the dreaded umbrella inversion caused by a gust of wind, I just hate bad umbrellas. And I\u2019ll bet I\u2019m not alone there, amiright?\n\nTo explain why the Hedgehog Umbrella belongs tucked into your backpack, rollaboard, glovebox, or what have you, let\u2019s start with the things it doesn\u2019t do. Like flipping inside out: until windspeeds pass 70 MPH, this umbrella won\u2019t invert. And as 70 mile per hour winds are just about Category 1 hurricane speeds, if you\u2019re facing those, you should probably get inside anyway.\n\nThe Hedgehog also won\u2019t blind passersby as walk or yourself as you open or close it because it doesn\u2019t have pegs sticking out off the ends of the ribs. And because of how securely the ribs are attached to the canopy, you can count on the panels not slipping off and sending a torrent of water cascading onto your shoulder. And finally, at less than a pound and barely a foot long when collapsed, this umbrella won\u2019t weigh you down or take much space, so you can go ahead and bring it along if there\u2019s any chance of rain.\n\nAt 41\u201d wide when open, the Hedgehog\u2019s canopy gives me plenty of coverage when I\u2019m alone and can cover me and my wife or a kid if we stick close. The canopy is deep enough to let me hide my head when crosswinds blow the rain rather sideways, and unlike I find with many umbrellas, the bottom side of this one stays dry, so my hair, hat, or hood don\u2019t soak through from contact with the canopy.\n\nWhile the nearly $100 price tag is more than I\u2019d usually spend on an umbrella, this thing is supposed to last a lifetime, so playing the long game on this one as an investment. And so far, so good. | Get it on Amazon >\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Scouted Newsletter Product recommendations that'll make your life better and tips to help you shop smarter.
