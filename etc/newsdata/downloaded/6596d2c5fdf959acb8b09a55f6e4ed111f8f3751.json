The feeling I get is that we're coming together at just the right time. I look at the quality of our team, our coaching and our support staff and it gives me immense confidence.'\n\nItoje enhanced his soaring reputation on that last Lions tour - notably with a command performance as the tourists won the second Test in Wellington, leaving thousands of delirious British and Irish fans chanting his name after the final whistle.\n\nItoje was outstanding for the Lions against the All Blacks in their own backyard in 2017\n\nHe joked that 'they could make an opera about that game' and described it as a 'good day', but insisted that he won't rely on that glorious memory to enhance his innate belief.\n\n'Quite honestly, even if I hadn't experienced beating them, I'd still have that same confidence,' he said. 'My confidence doesn't derive from the 2017 Lions tour. They are different teams and different circumstances. My confidence derives from the personnel we have and what we are capable of.\n\n'I have never ever gone into a game thinking that team is going to beat me. The way I see New Zealand, I respect what they have done but I don't see them as a team that is going to beat us.\n\n'They are a very good team and they have the capacity to do some very dangerous things, but I still believe that if we play our best rugby, we will win.'\n\nItoje also agreed that any side wanting to be considered the best in the world really has to conquer the All Blacks, as if it is a rite of passage in international rugby.\n\n'As Ric Flair (WWE wrestling champion) said, \"To be the man, you've got to beat the man\". If you want to be the best, you've got to beat the best. That is our challenge. That is what is in front of us.'", "description": "CHRIS FOY IN YOKOHAMA: Itoje has experienced success against the mighty All Blacks with the Lions and now he is convinced that he and his team-mates can take down New Zealand.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/00/20201764-0-image-a-10_1572045609534.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
