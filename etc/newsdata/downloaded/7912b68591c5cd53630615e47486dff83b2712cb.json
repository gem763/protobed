I am sorry to my daughter Sophia, and Georgia, and I am sorry to my husband,\" Huffman, who was accompanied to the court by her actor husband William H Macy, said. \"I have betrayed them.\"\n\nShe continued, saying that telling her daughter about the cheating was the hardest part of the ordeal: \"I can only say, I am so sorry Sophia. I was frightened, I was stupid, and I was so wrong. I am deeply ashamed of what I've done. I take full responsibility for my actions. I will deserve whatever punishment you give me.\"\n\nBefore that, prosecutors had argued forcefully for prison time, saying that the measure is necessary in this case in order to ensure that justice is served \u2014 and that Huffman does not get off with an easy sentence because of her considerably high position in society.\n\n\"Prison is the great leveller. Prison is necessary here,\" a federal prosecutor, seeking one month in prison for Huffman, said. \"She did this once, but she planned to do this again, signalling an inherent disregard for the laws that govern our society.\"\n\nHuffman, 56, was among 50 people who the US Attorney\u2019s Office in Massachusetts announced they were charging in the cheating scandal in March.\n\nThose charges were brought against Huffman and fellow actor Lori Loughlin, as well as coaches, admissions counsellors, other parents, Ms Loughlin\u2019s husband, and fashion designer J Mossimo Giannulli, all of whom were indicted related to accusations of falsifying SAT scores, and lying about athletic skills to secure university placement even though the students did not play those sports.\n\nBefore her sentencing, Huffman had asked for leniency from the Boston court, and said that she had acted out of a sense of devotion as a mother \u2014 and fear at the prospect of failing in her maternal duties. \u201cI find Motherhood bewildering,\u201d she wrote in a 1,400-word letter to federal judge Indira Talwani. \u201cFrom the moment my children were born, I was worried that they got me as a Mother. I so desperately wanted to do it right, and was so deathly afraid of doing it wrong.\u201d\n\nHuffman is a mother of two, and had been accused by prosecutors of agreeing to pay William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, a now-convicted admissions consultant who orchestrated the cheating scheme, $15,000 to improve one of her daughter\u2019s SAT scores by cheating.\n\nDuring that period of time, prosecutors have noted, Huffman was giving parenting advice online.\n\nProsecutors, who had asked that Huffman spend a month in prison for her time, also said that her daughter was not involved in the crime.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\n\nHuffman pleaded guilty last May to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, and honest services mail fraud. Her lawyers had said that one year of probation alongside 250 hours of community service and a $20,000 fine was an adequate punishment.\n\nShe is the first of nearly three dozen wealthy parents to be sentenced. The results have been watched closely to see if they signal that the other parents might receive harsh or lenient sentences, and some questions have been raised as to whether the white, rich defendants will be treated differently than if they were nonwhite and poor.\n\nThe maximum sentence for Huffman\u2019s crime, a felony, was 20 years in prison.", "description": "Actor Felicity Huffman has been sentenced to 14 days in prison for her part in America\u2019s largest college admissions cheating case, in which wealthy parents have been accused in a widespread conspiracy to cheat and game the US university entrance system.Speaking through tears during her sentencing hearing", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.fApuKvtW5mHshznc7Qluw--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/28e1797172354ad375be5dda1fc465f2", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
