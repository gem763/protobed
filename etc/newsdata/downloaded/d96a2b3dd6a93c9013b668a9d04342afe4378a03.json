The 25 basis\n\npoint rate cut is relatively priced in already, but what traders\n\nare really looking for is forward guidance,\" said Phillip\n\nFutures analyst Benjamin Lu.\n\nA quarter-point cut to U.S. interest rates is widely\n\nexpected when the Fed issues its next policy statement on\n\nWednesday. It would be the central bank's second such cut after\n\nlowering rates in July for the first time since 2008. FEDWATCH\n\nA press conference by Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled\n\nto follow the release of the central bank's statement.\n\nThe Fed's language and new economic projections will be\n\nexamined closely, given the backdrop of a bruising U.S.-China\n\ntrade war, stimulus by the European Central Bank and a stream of\n\nweak manufacturing data that hints at larger potential problems\n\nfor the United States.\n\n\"If the Fed goes against market expectations, there is a\n\nstrong possibility that we may see a short-term reversal (in\n\ngold prices) and a quick sharp test towards $1,455,\" Lu said.\n\nAttacks on Saudi Arabia's main oil refinery at the weekend\n\nhave also entered the equation, prompting U.S. President Donald\n\nTrump to apply more pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates.\n\n\"It appears conviction remains positive so long as gold\n\nhangs around $1,500,\" AxiTrader strategist Stephen Innes said in\n\na note, adding that the market has been caught between hedging\n\nagainst a possible U.S. military response on Iran and\n\nposition-squaring ahead of the Fed's two-day meeting.\n\nMeanwhile, currencies of oil-exporting countries held firm\n\nand the U.S. dollar found broad support as the attacks on Saudi\n\noil facilities and the threat of military action in the region\n\nbuoyed crude prices. USD/ MKTS/GLOB\n\nOn Monday Trump said it looked like Iran was behind the\n\nattacks but emphasised that he did not want to go to war.\n\nOn the technical front, spot gold looked neutral in a range\n\nof $1,488-$1,523.61, an escape from which could suggest a\n\ndirection, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.\n\nElsewhere, silver fell 0.3% to $17.79 an ounce,\n\nplatinum XPT= dipped 0.4% to $932.81 and palladium XPD= was\n\ndown 0.5% at $1,596.49 after touching a record high of $1,626.81\n\nin the previous session.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold steady as markets await Fed clues on rate outlook", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/STOCK-EXCHANGE-RUSSIAN-TRADING-SYSTEMS_800x533_L_1414427815.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
