Amidst this, government entities are also opting for the greener vehicles. Having fixated on using EVs, the question lies - which one? Not the Indian-made budget ones for sure!\n\nUnion government has now placed orders with Hyundai Motor Co. for the company\u2019s electric compact SUV - Hyundai Kona. For those unaware, the Kona made its Indian debut back in July this year with a price tag of Rs 25.3 lakh. It promises a range of 452 km on a single charge through its 39.2 kWh advanced lithium polymer battery.\n\nThat\u2019s more than twice the size of the batteries on the Mahindra eVerito and Tata Tigor EV, the two electric cars being used by the government officials to date. State-owned Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) had placed an order of 10,000 of these cars, 6,000 Tigor EV and 4,000 eVerito, in September 2017. The order has now been limited to 3,000 of these cars by March 2020 because of (get this!) the ongoing economic slowdown, as cited by a LiveMint report.\n\nHyundai Kona (Representative Image: Hyundai)\n\nThe cost of luxury\n\nAs of now, the Hyundai Kona is being used by select government officials, including Power and new and renewable energy minister Raj Kumar Singh as well as NTPC chairman and managing director Gurdeep Singh. Top officials at NITI Aayog might start using the electric SUV soon too.\n\nDon't Miss 774 SHARES 106 SHARES 992 SHARES 490 SHARES\n\nGovernment officials have shown disinterest in the Tata and Mahindra make in the past, blaming several issues in the cars for the same. Tata Tigor EV was blamed to have problems with its AC cooling and pick-up. Some even complained of sudden battery discharge and problems with charging in the electric sedan. The issues, however, were resolved after a delay, as per EESL. The same problems with Mahindra eVerito were limited to \u201cpoor performance and low mileage\u201d as per the report.\n\nCiting the inefficiencies in the Tata and Mahindra makes, the officials now aim to shift to Hyundai Kona. In this context, the electric SUV has been a revolutionary electric car for the Indian market, being the first battery powered vehicle promising the possibility of a long distance commute. Top that with all the luxury and comfort features that Hyundai has to offer and you will have a fair idea of what the Kona is.\n\nTata Tigor EV (Representative Image: IndiaTimes)\n\nIt is not hard to figure that the Hyundai Kona is the most desirable EV of the lot at the moment. But is that enough of a reason for the government officials to make a transition to it, keeping in mind the more than twice the cost of the EV in comparison with the Tata and Mahindra offerings? Taking EESL\u2019s earlier order of 10,000 EVs in mind, if all of them were to comprise of the Kona, the total cost of procurement of these vehicles would have gone through the roof. An easy calculation would reveal that the government would have been spending more than Rs 1000 crore extra in getting the same number of EVs if that was the case.\n\nThe predicament here can only be answered through the use case of such vehicles. If they are meant to be operational within a city, for regular commute to office, the Tata Tigor EV and the Mahindra eVerito are not bad deals at all. We have been using both the EVs in our office campus and here are our experiences with them to date.\n\nIf, however, the nature of work demands long distance hauls from one city to another, a Hyundai Kona would make more sense, of course, at its added price. So as the EV adoption in India unfolds, it will be interesting to see which EV finds space for which use case.", "description": "After using Tata Tigor EV and Mahindra eVerito, government officials are now looking to procure Hyundai Kona for their travel needs. The electric SUV is more than thrice as capable than both the other cars in terms of range but cost more than twice too. Here is a look into what really demands the need of such an expensive electric car for official use.", "authors": ["Sarthak Dogra"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Oct/electric_cars_in_india_electric_cars_used_by_government_officials_government_of_india_electric_car_1571651373_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
