Gavin Newsom made history last week when he signed into law SB 206, the Fair Pay to Play Act, which will allow student athletes in the state to get paid for the use of their name or likeness when it goes into effect in 2023. The NCAA vehemently opposed the bill.\n\nBut California\u2019s move may not be as controversial with the American public as you\u2019d think.\n\nThe latest Seton Hall Sports Poll, conducted by the Sharkey Institute at Seton Hall University, finds that 60% of people surveyed say student athletes should be allowed to profit from the use of their name, likeness, or image, while 32% said no, and 8% were unsure.\n\nOn the other hand, 59% of people say the governing body that should oversee the issue is the NCAA, while only 27% say it should be up to state governments.\n\nSeton Hall surveyed 714 U.S. adults by phone across the country from April 16 to April 19, with a margin of error of 3.8%.\n\nInterestingly, when the Seton Hall Sports Poll asked people in 2017 whether scholarships are sufficient compensation for college athletes, 60% said yes\u2014the same number that now say college athletes deserve to be free to sign endorsement deals.\n\nThose two data points may appear to contradict each other, but it is certainly possible to believe both that a scholarship is enough pay for a student athlete and that those athletes should be allowed to sign endorsements if they can get them. The 60% number in 2017 who said a scholarship is enough pay was also down from 71% in 2013 when asked the same question.\n\nNCAA President Mark Emmert answers questions at a news conference at the Final Four college basketball tournament, Thursday, April 4, 2019, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Matt York) More\n\nThe survey results are telling for the future of college athletics. The NCAA has fought back time and again against any proposals that college athletes earn compensation of any kind under its definition of \u201camateurism.\u201d Critics have retorted that Division I schools make millions on their men\u2019s football and basketball programs off the backs of those same \u201camateur\u201d athletes, who only get paid back in tuition.\n\nNCAA president Mark Emmert has slammed California\u2019s bill as an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to college sports and a \u201cnew form of professionalism.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, the idea of paying college athletes a salary or stipend is a different conversation from California\u2019s bill to allow athletes to sign paid endorsement deals.\n\nGov. Newsom signed SB206 live on the LeBron James HBO show \u201cThe Shop\u201d (James has been an outspoken supporter of paying college athletes) and said on the show that the move is \u201cgoing to initiate dozens of other states to introduce similar legislation, and it\u2019s going to change college sports for the better.\u201d\n\nIt would appear, based on this particular survey, that more than half of Americans agree.\n\n\u2014\n\nDaniel Roberts is the sports business writer at Yahoo Finance.
