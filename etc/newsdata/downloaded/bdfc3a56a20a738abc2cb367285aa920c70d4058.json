Cooler heads prevailed.\u2019\n\nOn Saturday, Hooper slammed the event before learning of its cancellation.\n\n\u2018It is totally inappropriate that an Islamophobic hate group would be in effect funneling money to the president of the United States by holding an event in one of his properties,\u2019 he told the Post.\n\nACT for America, which is based in Washington, DC, has been labeled a hate group by anti-racism watchdogs including the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nThe group promotes conspiracy theories about supposed Muslim plots to infiltrate America in order to impose Sharia (or Islamic religious law).\n\nThe organization was founded in 2007 by Brigitte Gabriel, a Christian woman from Lebanon who emigrated to the United States in 1989.\n\nACT for America, a group considered by some to be an anti-Muslim hate organization, will not be hosting a fundraiser at President Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate (seen above) in Palm Beach, Florida\n\nGabriel has been quoted as saying that a devout Muslim \u2018cannot be a loyal citizen to the United States of America.\u2019\n\nShe claims that ACT for America is \u2018fighting for the preservation of our Judeo-Christian culture where everybody can be free and do whatever they want to do as long as they respect the constitution and agree that everyone is equal under the law.\u2019\n\nOn its web site, the group rejects accusations that it supports bigotry.\n\n\u2018ACT for America has never, and will never, tolerate any bias, discrimination, or violence against anyone, based on their religion, gender, race, or political persuasion,\u2019 the group says.\n\n\u2018Freedom to practice one's religion in peace is afforded to each of us by the U.S. Constitution and we will defend it vigorously.\u2019\n\nA number of prominent Republicans have appeared at ACT for America events, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Congressman Peter King, Senator Ted Cruz, Congressman Steven King, and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.", "description": "ACT for America, a 'national security grassroots organization,' was founded by Brigitte Gabriel (pictured), a Lebanese Christian woman who immigrated to the U.S. in 1989.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/16/19402850-0-image-a-35_1570462413234.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
