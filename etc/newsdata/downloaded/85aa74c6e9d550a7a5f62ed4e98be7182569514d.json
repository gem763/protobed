But it's also true that Furman players have been showing the sign to honor No. 3 Emery May. My sincere apologies to Furman soccer & Emery for not getting the full story before I amplified an erroneous tweet. https://t.co/vV2aQ2d8Ir \u2014 Grant Wahl (@GrantWahl) October 14, 2019\n\nYou see, the injured player is No. 3 and the players were making the number 3 with their hands:\n\nEmery May, No. 3, tweeted on October 9 that he is being treated for blood clots:\n\nUnfortunately, I have learned over the past two days that I currently have two blood clots in my left arm as well as one in my right lung.
