In 2018, the Israeli Air Force claimed its new F-35s had attacked Iranian targets in Syria. Also in 2018, Arab press made dubious claims that IAF F-35s had flown over Iran.\n\nNow comes reports that Israeli F-35s have attacked Iranian targets in Iraq, according to Arab media.\n\nWestern diplomatic sources allegedly the London-based Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper that on July 19, \u201cTel Aviv carried out an airstrike earlier this month against an Iranian rockets depot northeast of Baghdad.\u201d\n\nEl Arabiya television reported that the strike hit Iranian ballistic missiles being transported in refrigerated food trucks. Several Hezbollah and Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps members were reportedly killed,\n\nA second strike targeted another Iranian base, according to Asharq Al-Awsat. \u201cThe Ashraf base in Iraq, a former base used by the Iranian opposition People's Mujahedin of Iran, was targeted by an air raid,\u201d according to the newspaper. \u201cThe base lies 80 kilometers from the border with Iran and 40 kilometers northeast of Baghdad. The sources revealed that the strikes targeted Iranian \u2018advisors\u2019 and a ballistic missile shipment that had recently arrived from Iran to Iraq.\u201d\n\nCompounding the mystery were initial reports that unidentified drones conducted the attacks.\n\nAmos Yadlin, former head of Israeli military intelligence, told U.S. publication Breaking Defense that Israel probably did attack Iranian targets in Iraq. \u201cApparently, Israel is really operating in Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is sensible that Israel will not claim responsibility for such an attack as it may complicate things for the U.S. Without referring to the specific attack I can say that the F-35 is the ideal aircraft for such an attack.\u201d\n\nAs so often in the Middle East, especially in the shadow war between Israel and Iran, it\u2019s hard to know exactly what happened. The tale changes with whoever tells it, and why they\u2019re telling it. Still, we can make some educated guesses.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Is that really possible?", "authors": ["Michael Peck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/N9gqBhGzhgVQGrdnZF.glg--~B/aD0xMTMxO3c9MTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/b7dbfacf175140c40fe5de95fefc966e", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
