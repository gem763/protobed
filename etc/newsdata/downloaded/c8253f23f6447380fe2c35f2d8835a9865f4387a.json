The House of Commons voted 322 vs 306 in favour of a key amendment by Oliver Letwin. This amendment means that any support that MPs give to the new Brexit deal is withheld until legislation to implement the deal has been passed. In short, the amendment closes a loophole in the Benn Act, that could still have allowed a no deal Brexit.\n\nUnder the Benn Act Boris Johnson was legally obliged to write a letter to the EU before 11pm on Saturday 19 October requesting an extension to Brexit. Shortly after the vote Boris Johnson was adamant that he would not negotiate an extension to Brexit with the EU.\n\nWhat does this mean for the pound?\n\nThe FX markets were closed on Saturday so the first sight of any reaction in the , the principal barometer to ups and downs of Brexit, will be as the markets the open on Sunday evening.\n\nPrimarily pound traders are focused on the chances of avoiding a no deal Brexit and levels of uncertainty. With today\u2019s vote once again increasing levels of uncertainty, the pound's rally to a 5-month high in the previous week could start to unwind in early trade at the start of the week. The pound has made it clear that it is not in favour of continued uncertainty. The pound\u2019s 6% rally so far this month is under threat.\n\nThe most important factor for sterling is what could happen next? Whilst on the one hand, today\u2019s vote makes a no deal Brexit less likely, that is only dependent on the EU agreeing to extend article 50.\n\nA refusal by the EU to extend article 50 raises the chances of a no deal Brexit substantially and could hit the pound hard.\n\nBoris Charges Ahead\n\nBoris has suggested that he will attempt to get the necessary legislation through this week regardless. This is politically a very ambitious plan. Depending on the House speaker, another vote could take place on Monday or Tuesday. Alternatively, this could also turn out to be a very drawn out process.\n\nBearish levels to watch:\n\nSupport can be seen around $1.26 and $1.24. Historically the pound has traded around $1.20 - $1.22 amid increased risk of a no deal Brexit. Further no deal fears could send the pound towards $1.1841, the 2016 lows.\n\nBullish levels to watch:\n\nOn the upside, resistance can be seen at $1.3150, $1.3185 and then next big level of resistance comes towards $1.34 at $1.3381\n\nRather than provide more clarity, today\u2019s vote has muddied the waters further. There could be heightened volatility on the open for the pound and the increased level of uncertainty could dampen demand for sterling after a phenomenal previous week.\n\nShort term levels to watch at the start of the week include $1.3050, $1.2990, $1.2780 and $1.27.\n\nLevels\n\nGBP/USD Levels\n\nDisclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
