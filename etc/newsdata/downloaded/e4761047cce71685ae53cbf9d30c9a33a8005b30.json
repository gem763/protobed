We haven\u2019t been able to post anything or read messages from other users.\n\nTwitter offered to unlock the accounts if I agree to a post saying that \u201cyour Tweet is no longer available because it violated the Twitter Rules.\u201d But Twitter refuses to explain why they locked our accounts when they treated liberals\u2019 accounts differently.\n\nFor my personal account in March, I tweeted that the perpetrator of the New Zealand mosque shooting was \u201ca socialist, environmentalist, who hates capitalists & free trade.\u201d I also wrote that the killer believed his attack would \u201clead to more gun control\u201d in New Zealand and the United States.\n\nAfter Twitter locked my account, I wrote about it in a New York Daily News article. Twitter then locked the Crime Prevention Research Center account because it linked to the News article.\n\nWhat I tweeted was entirely accurate, and the New York Daily News also fact-checked my op-ed piece.\n\nIn both cases, Twitter identified the offending tweets, and then wrote, \u201cWe determined this Tweet violated the Twitter Rules, specifically for:\u201d but the messages ended there. Appeals produced no additional information. When one logs into either account, the only thing you see is the offending Tweet. Twitter hasn\u2019t bothered to provide either the Crime Prevention Research Center or me with an official explanation for why the accounts were locked, but they have made clear that it was this tweet that supposedly violated their terms.\n\nFortunately, I was able to use a connection to ask what was happening, but other victims of Twitter\u2019s censorship may not even get an explanation. Because of that connection, a Twitter representative emailed me: \u201cDue to the safety of Twitter users and regulations abroad, Twitter does not allow linking to content that includes excerpts of manifestos of mass shooters.\u201d It applied to both my original tweet that linked to a page at the Crime Prevention Research Center that had a few quotes from the killer as well as to the Crime Prevention Research Center that linked to the New York Daily News article.\n\nThe explanation seems simple enough, but there is a problem. Lots of other accounts have tweeted a link to that same News piece, including the New York Daily News itself to its over 700,000 followers. More than 80 other accounts retweeted the link, some with many more followers than the CPRC. But none of these other accounts have been locked or had posts removed for linking to the article.\n\nThe Twitter representative\u2019s only possible explanation was that someone \u201creported\u201d the CPRC tweet, but that no one reported the other accounts\u2019 tweets. \u201cSpecifically, the new Australian law prompted Twitter to take a very aggressive approach on materials related to Christchurch. Companies can be fined up to 10% of their annual revenue.\u201d The Twitter representative told me that once someone reports a tweet that violated those countries\u2019 rules, they were powerless to ignore the complaint because the Australian and New Zealand governments would have been alerted to the violation.\n\nSo, with both of my Twitter accounts locked, I did something that I had never considered doing before. I asked people to report those tweets that had linked to my News piece. But nothing happened.\n\nWhy weren\u2019t the other accounts treated similarly? Twitter has refused to explain and stated that their decision is final.\n\nUnfortunately, the problem is much broader than my Daily News piece. A quick search reveals what seems like many hundreds of newspaper articles, as the Twitter representative wrote me about our account, extensively \u201clinking to content that includes excerpts of manifestos of mass shooters\u201d and many thousands of tweets linking to those articles.\n\nA Kansas City Star article quotes the New Zealand killer\u2019s manifesto at length on 12 occasions. But the article focuses on the killer\u2019s racism and claims, \u201cModern white supremacy is an international threat that knows no borders.\u201d By contrast, my piece mentioned that the killer \u201cfrequently disparages minorities, but his racism stems from environmentalist concerns.\u201d\n\nThe Star calls the killer a \u201cright-winger\u201d several times, I argued that he was in no way \u201cright-wing.\u201d Perhaps the censors at Twitter don\u2019t like to admit that a socialist/environmentalist who hates capitalism can also be a racist.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) was among the many whose tweets linked to a Star article claiming that it proved \u201cNew Zealand shooting suspect says in manifesto he was inspired by violent U.S. extremism.\u201d\n\nNor is it just the American media that extensively quotes from the killer\u2019s manifesto. Canada\u2019s National Post used 13 quotes and concentrated on the killer\u2019s racism without citing the manifesto\u2019s explanations concerning overpopulation and high minority birth rates.\n\nThe Twitter representative I spoke to said that any quotes from the manifesto would violate Australian and New Zealand censorship rules. But these and many other news articles shared more quotes from the manifesto than did my piece for The News.\n\nBut if the problem is a general \u201clinking to content that includes excerpts of manifestos of mass shooters,\u201d what is Twitter to make of the New York Times\u2019 recent Sunday article that extensively, if selectively, quoted from the El Paso killer\u2019s manifesto? The article tried to link the killer\u2019s discussion about immigration to similar words about illegal immigration used by conservative media stars. Regarding the article, its lead author, political reporter Jeremy Peters, tweeted: \u201cThe overlap between the El Paso killer\u2019s rhetoric and what\u2019s considered mainstream conservative rhetoric will make you stop cold.\u201d\n\nThe CPRC\u2019s tweet was about how the El Paso killer said: \u201cIn general, I support the Christchurch shooter and his manifesto.\u201d But why is Peter\u2019s tweet and article deemed acceptable and the CPRC\u2019s not?\n\nSo we are supposed to publicly agree that our \u201cTweet is no longer available because it violated the Twitter Rules\u201d when Twitter refuses to treat others similarly? But we want to get information out to people, so we are finally going to agree to their terms.\n\nIt\u2019s scary that a government halfway around the world can censor completely accurate American political debates, effectively interfering in our democratic process. It is still scarier when this censorship is selectively applied only to tweets by conservatives, and Twitter feels no need to explain their biases.\n\n* Lott is the president of the Crime Prevention Research Center and the author most recently of \u201cThe War on Guns.\u201d", "description": "For two months, Twitter has locked my personal twitter account, .09/02/2019 3:21:29AM EST.", "authors": ["John R.
