Gomes passed the trophy to Ryan Zimmerman. The original National, the franchise\u2019s first draft pick, the first baseman who missed most of this season only to return as a key postseason piece, stared at it. He thought about everyone in the past 14 years who inched this team from the dark days of early relocation to this moment. One of them, Jayson Werth, later stood feet away from him in the clubhouse.\n\n\u201cThey say you learn from your failures,\u201d Zimmerman said then. \u201cAll those guys who were on those teams are part of this tonight. \u2026 This organization's come a long way.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere's Ryan Zimmerman using the NLCS trophy as a large glass (via @Raggs_No_Riches)\n\n\n\nFollow us on Instagram to see more of the Nationals' locker room celebrations: https://t.co/2viulAypeb pic.twitter.com/bLURUEJGlg \u2014 Post Sports (@PostSports) October 16, 2019\n\nThen he handed the trophy to Gerardo Parra, who held it aloft as he surveyed the stadium through his signature rose-colored glasses.\n\nThe ceremony ended, the crowd ebbed and the celebration began. Players dispersed into chaos. Stephen Strasburg waded through the infield in search of his wife. Victor Robles tried to keep track of his teammates and mother. Daniel Hudson walked by wearing a backward hat and a frown.\n\n\u201cThought we were doing a lap?\u201d Hudson yelled to fellow pitcher Joe Ross, who shook his head, nonplussed.\n\nFeet away, Max Scherzer bounced with frenetic energy. Wander Suero, Juan Soto and Fernando Rodney grinned and shouted in Spanish to a selfie video. Andrew Stevenson, Austin Voth, Erick Fedde and Ross mock-argued over who got to keep a small pennant.\n\nAD\n\nRobles posed for photos with his mother, Marcia Brito, who saw him play a Major League Baseball game for the first time in this series. Eireann Dolan, Sean Doolittle\u2019s wife, leaped into her husband\u2019s arms, and her black-and-pink hair flew as she kissed him and buried her face in his chest. Strasburg finally spotted his wife.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d he said, and Rachel wrapped him in a hug.\n\nThe team shepherded the players toward the clubhouse, where the players formed a mosh pit to douse each other with beer, and be doused in return. Players and coaches alike used the trophy as a funnel for Budweiser. Rodney, Soto and Robles danced, the oldest and youngest of this team drawn together.\n\nAD\n\nCome for Brian Dozier chugging and dancing, stay for an up close and personal view of Max Scherzer pic.twitter.com/E7wLJxNBQh \u2014 Tramel Raggs (@Raggs_No_Riches) October 16, 2019\n\nThe more they celebrated, the more familiar characters emerged: Turner in a North Carolina State football helmet, Javy Guerra\u2019s ceramic tequila bottle, shirtless Brian Dozier and shirtless Gomes. This was the third celebration in as many weeks, and though it looked as raucous as ever, suds flying and bass slapping, it felt a little fatigued, or maybe reserved. (The boos were spirited, though, when Wilmer Difo at one point knocked over a tub of alcohol.)\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI told the boys, one more,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cLet\u2019s have one more champagne pop, and it will be a lot more gratifying than this one.\u201d\n\nThe gravity of this achievement alone, though, is not missed by anyone, especially not Werth. He played seven seasons for the Nationals before retiring. He stood in the back of the clubhouse Tuesday night, doling out handshakes and \u201cCongratulations!\u201d as he stood in a ring of old friends, including Anthony Rendon and Kurt Suzuki. Werth drank in the scene he\u2019d always hoped for but never achieved, falling victim again and again to the Nationals\u2019 incredible misfortune in the NL Division Series.\n\nAD\n\nSo much has changed since Werth left in 2017. One of the biggest is Strasburg, who has transformed this season. He\u2019s still withdrawn, still guarded, still spends most of his time during clubhouse celebrations on the sidelines with a beer in hand. But he dances now, spurred on by Parra and An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez. He did again Tuesday night in the middle of the Latin player\u2019s circle as they poured beers on him. Then he broke away, smiling, and reached into a tub for more beer.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no more left,\u201d he said.\n\nThe clock hurtled past 1 a.m. and, slowly, the clubhouse drained. Some dipped into cars destined for home. Most walked across the street to the Salt Line, a restaurant of which Zimmerman is a part-owner. Martinez carried the trophy there just before 2, and patrons sat stunned as the team that brought them out, that kept them out as the line blurred between late and early, paraded past. They stopped Robles for pictures and cheered loudest for the man known as \u201cBaby Shark.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDavey Martinez walks into a bar. pic.twitter.com/5VDe1rZS4q \u2014 Rudy Gersten (@DCBarno) October 16, 2019\n\nBut the players kept going. They walked by the booths and the bar toward the back of the room. They stepped past a massive bouncer and through two navy blue curtains into a room that could only be heard.\n\nThe bartender, at 2, turned up the lights for last call. Patrons in Nationals gear trickled out toward the end of a night they\u2019d remember forever while those responsible for it stayed behind the curtain. It was the end of the night and, usually, the bar would turn out the lights. But this was not a regular bar or a regular night. They did not do that. They were not done.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "The Nationals partied hard from the postgame podium to the clubhouse to the private room at the late-night restaurant.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OrzA5tT2UGUm7Hm2U3VopX0iSRw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VIYLLRXPZUI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
