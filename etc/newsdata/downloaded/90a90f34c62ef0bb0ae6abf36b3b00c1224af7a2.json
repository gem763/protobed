I didn\u2019t much like him, from what I could see, which, often as not, was a picture of him and his other over-privileged mates, including Boris Johnson, dressed up in their Bullingdon Club rig-out.\n\nThis, you may recall, was a secret Oxford student society that required as one of its initiation ceremonies a new member to burn a \u00a320 note (later \u00a350) in front of a homeless person. Maybe he did do this, maybe he didn\u2019t, but it doesn\u2019t say much for his judgement that he was prepared to hang out with people who would, and did.\n\nThat unconfirmed story about him placing his honourable member in a pig\u2019s gob (a dead one) may have been another of his youthful misjudgements. A man who is prepared to do those things and then to go on to feign support for Aston Villa/West Ham is not someone who is going to be especially easy to like: Just a sort of rubberised Blair-clone, really. I very much doubt his forthcoming memoir will prove me wrong. His reputation remains low, even though the 2010-15 Con-Lib Dem coalition feels like a paragon of strong and stable government at this distance.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Specifically, he draws fire for holding the 2016 EU referendum, which he promised, fought, lost and then ran away from.\n\nIt is widely regarded as his worst misjudgement by far \u2013 but this is where he has been hard done by. He did nothing wrong in promising that referendum back in 2013, and here is why.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nFirst, we had it coming. It was utterly inevitable. Sooner or later the British were going to have to face up to their basic unhappiness about the European project of \u201cever closer union\u201d. As Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, unkindly but accurately observed this week: \u201cThe British since the very beginning were part-time Europeans. What we need are full-time Europeans.\u201d\n\nThe 1975 referendum, on remaining in the then-European Economic Community, set the precedent. The inexorable process of European integration did the rest. Treaty after treaty was passed and ratified, and without much recourse to the voters. It was entirely right, in principle, to consult the people on a great issue of sovereignty, which is what Europe had become.\n\nIn fact, it was often put forward, by all parties. It was Liberal Democrat policy under Nick Clegg to have an In/Out referendum to settle the issue once and for all. New Labour promised a referendum on joining the euro in the 1997 election, and in 2004 and 2005 Tony Blair, as prime minister, made some slightly wobbly promises about a referendum on the new European \u201cconstitution\u201d. Lots of other EU countries were having referendums on Europe all the time. It wasn\u2019t a weird or a uniquely Cameronian idea.\n\nLook back to the fateful speech Cameron gave at the HQ of Bloomberg in London, on Wednesday 23 January 2013, and you can see the force of his case: \u201cPeople also feel that the EU is now heading for a level of political integration that is far outside Britain\u2019s comfort zone. They see treaty after treaty changing the balance between member states and the EU. And note they were never given a say.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had referendums promised \u2013 but not delivered. They see what has happened to the euro. And they note that many of our political and business leaders urged Britain to join at the time. And they haven\u2019t noticed many expressions of contrition. And they look at the steps the eurozone is taking and wonder what deeper integration for the eurozone will mean for a country which is not going to join the euro.\n\n\u201cThe result is that democratic consent for the EU in Britain is now wafer thin.\u201d\n\nOf course, being \u201cwafer thin\u201d might have meant that a referendum could well go the wrong way, and Cameron certainly overestimated his ability to win the argument, and badly underestimated his opponents, as the 2016 campaign painfully demonstrated. He was, it has to be said, also let down badly in the 2016 campaign by Jeremy Corbyn and Labour\u2019s lukewarm support.\n\nThe point about consent, however, remains, as it would have done had he won. As Cameron said in 2013: \u201cThat is why I am in favour of a referendum. I believe in confronting this issue \u2013 shaping it, leading the debate. Not simply hoping a difficult situation will go away.\u201d\n\nCertainly, his critics were never going to go away. If Cameron hadn\u2019t offered a referendum at that moment, then his party would have sacked him and found someone else who would \u2013 and there were plenty of eager Tories on the make who would have been all too happy to take his place. The Tory party, then as now, had more than its share of Eurosceptic fanatics, but they were alternately emboldened and spooked by the success of Nigel Farage and Ukip in successive rounds of elections and the opinion polls. Cameron, like many in his circle, despised this bunch of \u201cfruitcakes, loonies, and closet racists\u201d. But he could not ignore the electoral damage they were threatening to inflict on his party and his career.\n\nMaybe they overestimated the power of Ukip to deprive them of a majority at the election that arrived in 2015. Certainly Europe was not much on the voters\u2019 minds at the time, at least directly, and Ukip was usually a convenient bin for protest votes. But the collective judgement of the Conservative Party was that Ukip needed to be neutralised, and the party united around an agreed line \u2013 the referendum was the ideal way to do it.\n\nCameron could not have resisted the movement within his own ranks, and nor could anyone else have. The days when the likes of Ken Clarke or Michael Heseltine could have conceivably been the kind of personality the Tories would have had lead them were long, long gone by the 2010s.\n\nThus, it is Cameron\u2019s party, responding to the voters and acting on its own ideological Euroscepticism, that you can \u201cblame\u201d for the EU referendum, not Cameron personally. Perhaps if he had placed his leadership on the line, or made the positive case for Europe, or just fudged and dodged the issue a little longer, he might have got away with it.\n\nPerhaps the gamble that the Lib Dems would form a coalition with him again and prevent him from carrying out his promise might have worked \u2013 his majority in 2015 was slender.\n\nYet sooner or later he or a successor would have been forced to hold that public vote. It had been promised by too many leaders of all the main parties for far too long, and Ukip was taking votes away from all of them.\n\nThe one tactical error that Cameron and his allies did make was to insist the referendum was binding, at least politically, with that infamous passage in the official government pamphlet that went out after his \u201crenegotiation\u201d of the terms of UK membership:\n\n\u201cThis is your decision. The government will implement what you decide.\u201d\n\nIn fact, even that followed the 1975 precedent, when the prime minister, Harold Wilson, stated that \u201cit is your vote that will now decide. The government will accept your verdict.\u201d Had it have been merely and explicitly consultative, then the closeness of the 2016 vote might have allowed Cameron to set off to Brussels for a further renegotiation. Maybe. It\u2019s all a bit hypothetical.\n\nOf course, the thing to do now would be to have another referendum on the terms of Brexit, the Final Say that The Independent has been campaigning for. In the future we might have more referendums on the UK\u2019s position in the EU, or on specific new commitments or treaties. Referendums are not absurd things to do, much as it feels that way now, but they have to be run properly, with plans in place for what happens if they go one way or another.\n\nIf he believed in the power of a referendum to resolve the issue in 2013, and again in 2016, then Cameron should now be arguing for another referendum on that very same basis.", "description": "I never voted for David Cameron.
