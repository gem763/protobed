He repeated the word during the exchange and was subsequently fired.\n\n\u201cShort story.... I get called a b**** ass n***** by a student, I responded do \u2018not call me a n----!\u2019 And I got fired,\u201d the security guard wrote on Facebook.\n\nMadison schools have a zero tolerance policy on staff using racial slurs.\n\nAt least seven Madison School District employees resigned or were dismissed over using such language in front of students in the last school year.\n\nMr Anderson was fired on Wednesday after 11 years working for the Madison Metropolitan School District.\n\nHe said he was just trying to defend himself and argued that the context of the exchange should be taken into account.\n\n\u201cMy understanding of the policy was white staff shouldn\u2019t use the N-word under any circumstances,\u201d the security guard told NBC News.\n\n\u201cBut I had no idea me being called the word and me telling the student not to call me the word would get me fired.\u201d\n\nHundreds of pupils at Madison West walked out of classes on Friday to protest Mr Anderson\u2019s dismissal.\n\nAround 1,500 pupils marched through Madison to the school district offices, chanting \u201dHey-hey, hey-ho, zero tolerance has got to go!\u201d and \u201cDo Better!\u201d\n\nThe news also attracted attention on social media, with Cher, the singer, offering to pay the security guard\u2019s legal fees if he chose to sue the board.\n\nKaren Boran, the school\u2019s head teacher, said the zero-tolerance approach had been applied consistently.\n\nBut Gloria Reyes, the district school board president, said she wanted the board to review its policy on racial slurs as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThis is an incredibly difficult situation, and we acknowledge the emotion, harm and complexity involved,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMany people in our community and our district are grappling with that complexity, and we will continue to do so as we go forward.\u201d\n\nThe Madison teachers\u2019 union has filed a grievance with the school district board on Mr Anderson\u2019s behalf. Ms Reyes said she had directed officials to handle the complaint quickly.\n\nBut Jane Belmore, the board\u2019s superintendent, said the zero tolerance policy was designed to protect students from harm, no matter the circumstances or intent involved.\n\nShe added that \u201cdifferent viewpoints\u201d had emerged and that the district would review the policy.\n\nMr Anderson said he was left overwhelmed by the response from pupils defending him.\n\n\u201cIt got me a little emotional, because to be honest, you don\u2019t get that type of response from people until you\u2019re in a casket,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies\n\nRead more\n\nUniversities 'must do more' to tackle racial harassment on campus", "description": "A black school security guard has been fired after asking a pupil not to call him the N-word.Marlon Anderson said the teenager, who is also African American, used the racial slur repeatedly to refer to him.", "authors": ["Zamira Rahim"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EFxaqYgBRdW3n2gyUAFVyg--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/1c035b1316dd5920ea5daafa15f12c0c", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
