Nasdaq-100 futures NQZ19, +0.29% were up 19.25 points, or 0.2%, at 7,806.25.\n\nThe Dow DJIA, -0.30% on Thursday gave up 79.59 points, or 0.3%, to end at 26,891.12, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.24% lost 7.25 points or 0.2%, to finish at 2,977.62. The Nasdaq COMP, -0.58% closed at 8,030.66, down 46.72 points, or 0.6%.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the market?\n\nThe weaker tone on Thursday was tied in part to a news report that the Trump administration was unlikely to extend a waiver that allows U.S. companies to make sales to China telecom firm Huawei, potentially stoking trade tensions.\n\nBut futures were lifted after a report that a date for U.S.-China trade talks has been set. CNBC reported that top negotiators are set to meet Oct. 10-11 in Washington, with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He to lead the delegation from Beijing. Also, news reports said Chinese officials have talked about increased purchases of U.S. goods.\n\n\u201cWith President Trump heavily focused on the impeachment proceedings and the unidentified whistleblower, markets are expecting this long process to possibly provide added incentive to see a trade deal get done before Thanksgiving,\u201d said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, in a note.\n\nBut skeptics said they remained unconvinced after numerous swings between conciliation and escalation over the course of the U.S.-China trade battle stretching back to spring of last year.\n\n\u201cWe have been here before,\u201d said Bas van Geffen, quantitative analyst at Rabobank.\n\nFundamental issues, including intellectual property rights, remain unaddressed so far, van Geffen said in a note, adding that Trump may be reluctant to create the appearance he\u2019s growing soft on China ahead of the 2020 elections \u2014 a risk he runs if an intermediate deal doesn\u2019t sufficiently address fundamental U.S. concerns.\n\n\u201cWe are not convinced that renewed trade talks will lead to the results the market may once again be hoping for, and any optimism ahead of the October meeting may be fleeting,\u201d he said.\n\nA whistleblower report released on Thursday alleged that President Donald Trump attempted to coerce Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden, and that White House officials acted to conceal evidence of his actions. The controversy around the report prompted House Democrats this week to launch a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe whistleblower report and impeachment concerns have had only a fleeting at most effect on markets so far, analysts said, but could become a factor if the outlook for Trump\u2019s presidency darkens.\n\nOn the corporate front, Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, -0.79% announced Friday that it hired Charles Scharf as chief executive, ending a six-month search for a new chief. Scharf was most recently chairman and CEO of Bank of New York Mellon Corp. BK, -0.55%. Shares of Wells Fargo rose 1.4% in premarket activity.\n\nShares of Micron Technology Inc. MU, -1.76% will be in focus after the memory-chip maker reported another large earnings decline and predicted a disappointing holiday season. Micron shares were under pressure in premarket action.\n\nWhat\u2019s on the economic calendar?\n\nThe economic calendar is crowded. Data on August durable goods orders is due at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, with economists surveyed by MarketWatch looking for a 0.7% fall in headline figure.
