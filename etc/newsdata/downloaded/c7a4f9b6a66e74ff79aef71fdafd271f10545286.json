There has also been no sign of a withdrawal of Kurdish-led forces from positions along the Syrian-Turkish border as called for under the agreement, reached between Turkey and the US.\n\nTurkey\u2019s defence ministry said it was \u201ccompletely abiding\u201d by the accord and that it was in \u201cinstantaneous coordination\u201d with Washington to ensure the continuity of calm. The ministry accused Kurdish-led fighters of carrying out 14 \u201cattacks and harassments\u201d in the past 36 hours, mostly in the town of Ras al-Ayn, which was besieged by allied fighters before the ceasefire. It said Syrian-Kurdish fighters used mortars, rockets, anti-aircraft and anti-tank heavy machine guns.\n\nTurkey also said it had recaptured 41 suspected Islamic State members who had fled a detention camp amid the chaos caused by the fighting earlier this week.\n\nThe Kurds, meanwhile, appealed to the US vice-president, Mike Pence, to enforce the deal saying Turkey has failed to abide by its provisions and has continued the siege of Ras al-Ayn.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said there were still clashes inside Ras al-Ayn and medical personnel could not enter to help the wounded.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Turkish-backed fighters entered Syria and advanced into Kurdish-held Shakariya, a village east of Ras al-Ayn where there were clashes and a Turkish strike a day earlier.\n\nVideo posted online showed the fighters driving alongside the wall Turkey has erected along the border and boasting that they were headed on \u201can assault\u201d into Syria. The video did not show them crossing the border.\n\nSyrian state media said Turkish-backed fighters also made an \u201cinfiltration attempt\u201d south of Ras al-Ayn but were repelled in clashes with the Syrian government military that had just moved into the area. The reports gave no further details.\n\nQuick guide What is happening in north-eastern Syria? Show Hide Who is in control in north-eastern Syria? Until Turkey launched its offensive there on 9 October, the region was controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which comprises militia groups representing a range of ethnicities, though its backbone is Kurdish. Since the Turkish incursion, the SDF has lost much of its territory and appears to be losing its grip on key cities. On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by Turkey and its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus. That leaves north-eastern Syria divided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF \u2013 for now. On 17 October Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, agreed with US vice-president Mike Pence, to suspend Ankara\u2019s operation for five days in order to allow Kurdish troops to withdraw. How did the SDF come to control the region? Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province. In late 2014, the Kurds were struggling to fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers. Why does Turkey oppose the Kurds? For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside Turkey. Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF\u2019s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis. What are Turkey\u2019s objectives on its southern border? Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump\u2019s recent announcement that American soldiers would withdraw from the region. Erdo\u011fan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this \u201csafe zone\u201d, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border. How would a Turkish incursion impact on Isis? Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria. SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.\n\nOn 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials. It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside. Michael Safi\n\nThe Observatory said Turkish-backed Syrian fighters had prevented a medical convoy from reaching Ras al-Ayn. It said the medical convoy arrived outside the town on Friday but Turkish-backed factions closed the road ahead and behind, leaving it stuck outside Ras al-Ayn.\n\nThe agreement \u2013 reached after negotiations between Erdo\u011fan andPence \u2013 would virtually hand Turkey its aims in the invasion, requiring Kurdish fighters to vacate a swath of territory in Syria along the Turkish border during the ceasefire.\n\nThe Kurdish-led force, which said it was in contact with the Americans during the negotiations, said it would abide by the ceasefire but has not committed to any pull-out. Erdo\u011fan warned on Friday that Turkey will relaunch its assault on Tuesday when the deal runs out if the Kurdish fighters do not pull out of a zone 30km (20-miles) deep running the entire length of the border.\n\nOn Saturday, the Turkish interior minister, S\u00fcleyman Soylu, said 41 suspected Isis members were recaptured after fleeing a detention camp amid fighting earlier this week in Syria. He said 195 further suspected Isis members had been recaptured, adding that they would be relocated to areas controlled by Turkey in northern Syria, including Afrin and al-Bab.\n\nIt was reported last week that after a Turkish shell landed near Ain Issa camp that holds members of Isis families, more than 700 managed to flee amid the chaos.\n\nTurkey\u2019s state-run English language broadcaster TRT World said the Isis members and families were captured by Turkish-backed Syrian opposition forces.\n\nErdo\u011fan has accused Syrian Kurdish forces of releasing 750 Isis members and families, amid Turkey\u2019s offensive. The Kurds say they broke out of their camp a week ago, attacking guards, amid heavy clashes and Turkish airstrikes nearby.", "description": "Turkey-US deal asks Kurdish forces to vacate designated \u2018safe zone\u2019 in northern Syria during five-day ceasefire", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04dcac727aa598ec771d8528f6a0a467919af96d/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d8afe90686939984469dece30cb20411", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
