(Photo: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMichael Douglas blew out 75 candles on Sept. 25, the same day his longtime wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones, turned 50. It\u2019s an age difference that he\u2019s both noticed and enjoyed since they began dating in the late \u201890s.\n\n\u201cHaving a younger bride makes me feel good on one side,\u201d Douglas said on Thursday\u2019s edition of \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show.\u201d\n\nThen, he mentioned his famous father, Kirk Douglas, who turns 103 in December.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the old man over here on the other side, who still has a full head of hair,\u201d the \u201cFatal Attraction\u201d star said. \u201cIt\u2019s all good. You can\u2019t be an idiot about it. So 75, I look at the 15-year program, if I still got my marbles by the time I\u2019m 90. After that, it\u2019s all golden.\u201d\n\nDouglas and Zeta-Jones married in 2000, after they were introduced by his close friend and sometimes co-star Danny DeVito. They share two kids, 19-year-old son Dylan and daughter, Carys, 16. (His older son, 40-year-old Cameron, was born to Douglas and his first wife, Diandra Luker.) Douglas and Zeta-Jones split briefly in 2013 \u2014 following his struggle with cancer \u2014 but they ultimately decided to reunite, making them one of the longer-lasting couples in Hollywood.\n\nFor her part, Zeta-Jones has attributed their success as a couple to being \u201copen and honest.\u201d\n\nShe never saw the couple\u2019s 25-year age difference as a bad thing, either.\n\n\u201cWhen my mother was telling me about men and telling me the facts of life, she never actually put an age bracket on it,\u201d the \u201cChicago\u201d actress told CNN\u2019s Larry King in July 2001. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so funny, because Michael and my parents are the same age. So they \u2014 my parents \u2014 when they see us together, never even question that there was a 25-year age difference.\u201d\n\nDouglas and Zeta-Jones will celebrate their 19th anniversary next month.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
