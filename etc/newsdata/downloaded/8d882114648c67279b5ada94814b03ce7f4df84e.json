The firemen arrived as I left.\n\n\u201cI just went to the shop nearby, parked and waited,\u201d he said, adding that he couldn\u2019t sleep all night.\n\n\u201cWhen I came back in the morning, at 6:00 am, it was just embers, like charcoal,\u201d the artist said. \u201cThe (water) tower fell into my studio.\u201d\n\nHoefer has been staying in his car since the fire.\n\n\u201cI had just bought this wonderful new bed,\u201d Hoefer said. \u201cForgot my passport and everything inside the studio.\u201d\n\nBesides Hoefer\u2019s studio, the historic building housing the winery\u2019s main pavilion was also destroyed by the fire \u2014 along with about 2,000 bottles of wine.\n\nJust the stone facade remains standing along with an enormous steel sculpture of a boar called \u201cLord Snort.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018We\u2019re alive\u2019 \u2013\n\nBuilt in 1869, the building had served over the years as a bank, a general store and a post office, said Isabelle Adams, the hospitality director at Soda Rock.\n\nHistorical records show there was once a winery on the site in the 1880s.\n\nThe current owners, Ken and Diane Wilson, bought the property in 2000 and reopened its doors as Soda Rock Winery in 2010, hosting weddings, concerts and other events in addition to wine tastings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shocking,\u201d Adams said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just stuff. We rebuilt everything once already. We\u2019re just going to have to do it again.\u201d\n\nAnother Sonoma County resident, Josh Terry, lost his home in the 2015 Valley Fire and defied the mandatory evacuation warnings this time around to try to save his house.\n\n\u201cTook the kids, grabbed my guitar, a picture off the wall and left,\u201d the 41-year-old welder said of his 2015 experience. \u201cI lost my house. This time I wasn\u2019t going to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 2015, I always felt I could have done something, you know,\u201d Terry told AFP as he worked on his motorcycle next to his red wooden home. \u201cI could have soaked my roof, turned sprinklers on.\u201d\n\nTerry said he had made preparations to flee this time also but decided to stick it out.\n\n\u201cCar is packed to the brim, still is,\u201d he said. \u201cMy dad is angry at me for not leaving.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were safe here, I felt,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fire guys did their jobs. They set up shop real quick in this yard here and the wind shifted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re alive and this is where I want to be so I\u2019m happy.\u201d", "description": "Santa Rosa (United States) (AFP) \u2013 As firefighters battled the infernos that have engulfed California\u2019s Sonoma wine region, Wade Hoefer", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/94f61f_wade-hoefer-71-artist-in-residence-soda-rock-winery-surveys-remains-his-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
