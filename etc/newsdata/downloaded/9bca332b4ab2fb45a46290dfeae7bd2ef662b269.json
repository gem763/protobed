Johnson Tells Tusk U.K. Will Send Letter For Brexit Delay\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our Brexit Bulletin, follow us @Brexit and subscribe to our podcast.\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans were again thrown into chaos after the U.K. parliament voted to take more time to scrutinize the deal the prime minister struck with the European Union this week.\n\nWithout Parliament\u2019s sign-off, Johnson is required by law to send a letter to Brussels on Saturday requesting that Brexit be delayed until Jan. 31 -- three months after his self-imposed deadline. At a rare Saturday sitting, lawmakers voted by 322 to 306 in favor of a rebel Tory\u2019s proposal to withhold their approval for now.\n\n\u2014 Bloomberg TicToc (@tictoc) October 19, 2019\n\n\n\nAccording to a person familiar with a conversation Johnson had with European Council President Donald Tusk, the U.K. will send a letter requesting a delay tonight.\n\nBut in a post-vote letter to MPs and peers in the House of Lords, Johnson said he \u201cwill not negotiate a delay\u201d with the EU and that the government will introduce new legislation next week \u201cneeded for us to leave the European Union with our great new deal\u201d on Oct. 31.\n\nThe person familiar with the conversation said Tusk will start consulting EU leaders on how to react, which may take a few days.\n\nThe result prolongs the 3 1/2 years of political turmoil triggered by the referendum. The possible outcomes range from delaying Brexit -- allowing time for a general election or a second referendum on leaving -- to a battle in court, or a chaotic and economically damaging departure from the bloc without a deal in just 12 days.\n\n\u2014 Bloomberg TicToc (@tictoc) October 19, 2019\n\n\n\nJohnson\u2019s hopes of meeting his deadline of getting the U.K. out of the EU by the end of the month now rest on pushing the legislation that implements his deal through Parliament in less than two weeks. The Withdrawal Agreement Bill could begin its journey as soon as Tuesday. But, on Monday, Johnson will make another attempt to get Parliament to sign off on the principle of his deal, making the extension unnecessary.\n\nThe scale of Johnson\u2019s defeat on Saturday, though, shows the problem he has created for himself by alienating his allies in the Democratic Unionist Party. Their 10 votes made the difference between defeat and victory.\n\nThey had supported Johnson until this week, when he signed a Brexit deal that creates a customs border in the Irish Sea -- a concession designed to secure Ireland and the EU\u2019s support for the agreement. The DUP angrily denounced that during the debate.\n\nWhen Johnson does try to push his deal through, the question will be, as it was on Saturday morning, whether he has the votes. The day saw Conservative MPs, both current and almost all those he expelled last month, saying they would vote with him, as well as a small number of Labour MPs. If he can hold that coalition together for two weeks, he might have a chance.\n\nJohnson could still try to circumvent the legislation forcing him to seek a delay, but he do so, he would be certain to face legal challenges that could end up in the U.K. Supreme Court.\n\nAssuming he concedes and sends the letter, an extension will require the unanimous agreement of EU leaders. The European Commission urged the British government to clarify its next steps.\n\nOn Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron said one shouldn\u2019t be granted. But Macron made similar noises before approving a Brexit delay in April. EU officials say it\u2019s unlikely that he or any other leader would refuse another one, particularly if the U.K. was headed for a general election.\n\nOn Saturday, the French presidency said in a statement: \u201cOur message is clear: a deal has been negotiated. It is now up to the British parliament to say if it approves it or rejects it. An additional delay is in no one\u2019s interest.\u201d\n\nIf attempts to avert a no-deal Brexit fail, the consequences for Britain are likely to be severe. According to the government\u2019s own analysis, a no-deal Brexit would cause disruption to trade, financial services, and food supplies, and risk civil disorder.\n\n(Adds conversation with Tusk beginning in third paragraph.)", "description": "Johnson Tells Tusk U.K. Will Send Letter For Brexit Delay", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC6H0BP_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
