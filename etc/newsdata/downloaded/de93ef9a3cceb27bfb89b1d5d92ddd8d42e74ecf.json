Today, Russia occupies 20 percent of Georgia and continues to encroach on Georgian territory via a campaign of \u201ccreeping annexation.\u201d\n\nYet, despite Russia\u2019s malign influence, Georgia has made tremendous progress over the past decade. The government has continued its march toward greater integration with the West, and it has made remarkable advances in liberalizing the Georgian economy.\n\nA North Atlantic Treaty Organization aspirant since 2008, Georgia has been especially close with the European Union since 2014, when Tbilisi entered the EU-Georgia Association Agreement. Among other provisions, that pact established a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area, giving Georgia the so-called \"four freedoms\" of the EU Single Market: free movement of goods, services, capital and people.\n\nGeorgia has also maintained a solid partnership with the United States. It has contributed to the U.S. mission in Afghanistan for years, and still has 870 soldiers stationed there. This has been no mere back-of-the-line service, either. Georgia has suffered the highest casualty rate of all coalition partners in Afghanistan.\n\nBack home, Georgia has done an outstanding job of throwing off the shackles of its Soviet past and liberalizing it economy. The Heritage Foundation has published its annual Index of Economic Freedom since 1996. During that time, Georgia jumped from the ranks of \u201ceconomically repressed\u201d countries and joined the ranks of the \u201ceconomically free.\u201d Its ascension in Index rankings, from number 124 to number 16, is the greatest improvement on record.\n\nFor years the United States has discussed entering a free trade agreement with Georgia. Now is the time to do it.\n\nFor one thing, it would be a tangible demonstration of U.S. support for Georgia\u2014something especially desirable ahead of next year\u2019s parliamentary elections. It is a given that, throughout the campaign season, pro-Russian propaganda will assert that there is no point in voting for a pro-Western party since the West (supposedly) never reciprocates Georgia\u2019s overtures. Entering a U.S.-Georgia free trade agreement would destroy that argument.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t about sticking it to Russia. Through its economic reforms and its heroic support of the West on the international stage, Georgia has proven itself worthy of being a free trade partner. And the table is already set to make it happen.\n\nA high-level trade dialogue exists between the United States and Georgia. It was introduced in January 2012. The Georgian Embassy\u2019s website describes the dialogue as \u201ca platform for deepening bilateral economic relations [that] has the potential to increase trade and investment between the two countries.\u201d\n\nThe United States and Georgia also have signed a bilateral investment treaty and a bilateral trade and investment framework agreement.\n\nA free trade agreement would only strengthen an already strong Georgia-U.S. trade relationship.\n\nHowever, if the United States desires to have an immediate impact on furthering Georgia\u2019s western integration and demonstrating its support, then Congress needs to quickly confirm Kelly C. Degnan as U.S. ambassador to Georgia. For a year and a half now, the U.S. embassy in Tbilisi has had no ambassador, and the effects of that have been felt among Georgians.\n\nGeorgia has proven that it deserves U.S. commitment and a stronger alliance. It\u2019s also shown that it is capable and deserving of a free trade agreement with the United States. There\u2019s no time to waste in creating one.", "description": "Eleven years ago, Russia invaded Georgia\u2019s Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions, instigating a brutal, five-day war.
