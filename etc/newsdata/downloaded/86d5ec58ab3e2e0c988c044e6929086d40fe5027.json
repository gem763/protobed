Mitch McConnell and former NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch.\n\nMessing has been vocal on Twitter following the two mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio which took the lives of dozens of people this past weekend. The \"Will and Grace\" star quickly found herself in hot water after she tweeted a response to a user's tweet that some called \"sick.\"\n\nDEBRA MESSING DENIES GETTING PLASTIC SURGERY AFTER FANS CALL HER OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\n\u201cIf I get killed in a mass shooting please cremate me and throw my ashes into Mitch McConnell\u2019s and Dana Loesch\u2019s eyes while I\u2019m still smoldering,\u201d the tweet read. The liberal star said in reply: \"THIS. Yesssssssssss.\"\n\nUsers who saw the tweet were quick to call out the 50-year-old actress for her remark.\n\nDEBRA MESSING CALLS US ARMY 'DISGUSTING AND IRRESPONSIBLE' AFTER ANNOUNCING BORDER WALL FUNDING\n\n\u201cDebra -- people from all political leanings consume your shows and enjoy you and them. Why would you take a deep dive into the disgusting by reacting like this to a horrific tweet? Take a breath. Get out of the Hollywood mindset for a second and be a person. Thanks,\u201d one user wrote.\n\n\u201cI loved Will & Grace ( it should have been the Jack & Karen show ) but you\u2019re obviously a sick person. Please seek help. Seriously,\u201d another commented.\n\n\u201cYou have an amazing opportunity to be an inspiration to people, yet you use your voice in this way. Seems like a waste. God bless!\u201d someone else noted.\n\n\"Cremate the remains of her fallen acting career,\" another user wrote.\n\n\"I don\u2019t like Mitch, but this is in very poor taste,\" someone else wrote.\n\n\"Love your acting skills but who you really are is very disappointing. Thanks for showing us the real you!\" someone else concluded.\n\nMessing, however, was undeterred by the negative reception to her tweet. She continued to post a slew of retweets and messages calling for gun control and for GOP leaders to take action throughout the weekend.\n\nEarlier on Monday, she promoted a sound bite from her appearance on Alyssa Milano\u2019s \u201cSorry Not Sorry\u201d podcast in which she called for President Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThis is my statement about whether impeachment is the appropriate road to take against the sitting President,\u201d she captioned the sound clip. \u201cIt was given before the devastating and preventable 4 mass shootings in the last 24 hours. I should have included the blocking of background checks as another dereliction. Please don\u2019t bother wishing me death or attack me . This is my account, it\u2019s my opinion, if you don\u2019t like to hear it, don\u2019t follow me.\u201d\n\nMessing did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment.", "description": "Debra Messing is facing backlash over a tweet that many took to be inciting violence against Sen.
