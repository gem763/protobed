If I had moved in the summer, there were clubs ready to pay \u20ac100m to sign me and I would have earned a lot more.\n\nThe 26-year-old tenacious midfielder has not been able to lead PSG to European glory yet\n\n'Neymar, he could have earned as much with Manchester City or Chelsea. He didn't sign here for the money but the project. It's the same with me.'\n\nAs it happens, Barcelona decided to buy Andre Gomes from Valencia - who is now at Everton - and Denis Suarez from Villarreal.\n\nVerratti has gone on to make 288 appearances for PSG, in a seven-year stint which has brought six Ligue 1 titles, four French Cups but a disappointing best-showing of the quarter-finals in the Champions League.", "description": "Verratti has disclosed that Barcelona did indeed make him an offer in 2016, following Xavi's departure and with Andres Iniesta's time coming to a gradual end, and even offered him more money.", "authors": ["Kieran Jackson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/15/19842880-0-image-a-61_1571323571798.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
