(CBC)\n\nGovernments are expected to act with restraint until after election day and MPs convene in Ottawa again, because even if the government appears to have been re-elected, it can't assume it will have the confidence of the House of Commons while there is no elected chamber to say so.\n\nThe prime minister and cabinet retain their positions to do routine business and respond to emergencies, although any major decisions are usually done in consultation with opposition parties \u2014 an issue spelled out in the 2019 \"caretaker\" guidelines.\n\nWhile most of the 2019 guidelines mirror the 2015 document, there are some additions aside from the warning about social-media use.\n\nDepartments are told they can implement regulations approved before Parliament's dissolution, but should be more \"reactive as opposed to proactive\" when it comes to communicating with affected groups or organizations.\n\nRegulatory initiatives that are \"high-profile or controversial\" should be avoided as much as possible, this year's guidelines say.\n\nThere is also a section on what happens if there is any attempt by foreign actors to manipulate the results of the Oct. 21 vote.\n\nA panel of top civil servants have been tasked with alerting the public should such a situation arise.", "description": "The country's top civil servant is sending a stern warning to government workers as part of election campaign guidelines.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5293622.1569235879!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ian-shugart-privy-council-canada.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
