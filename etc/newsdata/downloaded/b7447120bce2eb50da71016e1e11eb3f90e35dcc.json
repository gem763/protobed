The move away from streaming and towards podcasts is starting to reap benefits, though. Time to be a buyer of SPOT on any weakness.\n\nPlay It Again With Pairs Trade in Netflix and Spotify Stock More\n\nSource: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock.com\n\nFortune even contended back in May 2018 that Spotify has a broken business model and will never be profitable. Despite reporting its first operating profit in 13 years last February, some analysts have been skeptical that significant returns will ever come.\n\nHowever, after the company\u2019s recent implementation of significant operational changes, SPOT stock now represents a bargain at just under $130 a share.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nI\u2019m not buying into the arguments of streaming enthusiasts like New York University\u2019s Larry Miller. He recently suggested to CNBC that streamers will bankrupt the radio industry within a decade. Most traders know that music streaming is not very profitable, at least on its own, and that streaming services like Spotify would be wise to embrace some of the same attributes of the radio industry, which draw the vast majority of audio listening to local radio stations.\n\nSpotify Stock Chart\n\nThat is exactly why I believe now is an ideal time to buy shares of Spotify. SPOT analyzed the long-term success of radio and other businesses connected to music. It then shifted away from its exclusive music focus and towards a more sustainable business model. Its focus on building a loyal customer base is beginning to pay off.\n\nSPOT is also looking attractive on a technical basis. Spotify stock reached oversold levels on a nine-day relative strength index basis before strengthening. The moving average convergence/divergence also reached an extreme and has since headed higher. Bollinger Percent B was negative and now has reversed to turn positive. There is major long-term support at $120. SPOT stock is also at a big discount to the 20-day moving average which has led to a pop in the past.\n\nJust weeks ago, one year after radio giant iHeartMedia (NASDAQ:IHRT) acquired podcasting pioneer Stuff Media, Spotify unveiled Spotify for Podcasters, an interface that will greatly increase the number of show series on the Spotify app. This follows the move earlier by SPOT to delve further into podcasting. Spotify acquired podcast industry giants like Gimlet Media, Anchor and Parcast to further this initiative.\n\nSPOT Stock and Podcast Profitability\n\nThis shift to podcasting should soon have positive effects for profitability, and ultimately, SPOT stock. Believe it or not, the radio industry still reaches more Americans (93%) than any other platform. This has less to do with music and more to do with the wide, loyal following brought about by the connection between host and listener. SPOT is looking to capitalize on this connection via podcasts.\n\nThe Washington Times recently underscored this point by using the example of Casey Kasem and his renowned \u201cAmerican Top 40\u201d syndicated radio program. Despite Kasem having not been live on the air for years, thousands of people still tune into the re-run tapings. According to The Washington Times, the reason is because, \u201cwhile they can listen to their favorite oldies anywhere \u2026there\u2019s only one place they can get Casey.\u201d", "description": "Shares of Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) have been struggling since its IPO in early 2018.
