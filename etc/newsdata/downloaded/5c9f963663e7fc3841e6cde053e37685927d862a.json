Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said his plan would work similar to the way conventional tobacco cigarettes are taxed, in order to discourage teens and young adults from using the products.\n\nWyden, ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, disclosed his plan to propose a federal levy on vaping devices the same day that Michigan\u2019s Democratic governor announced plans to ban flavored e-cigarettes in that state.\n\nVAPING-LINKED DEATH PROBED IN OREGON, SYMPTOMS SIMILAR TO MORE THAN 200 CASES\n\nSuch proposals have been derided by Republicans and conservatives as efforts to expand the so-called \u201cnanny state\u201d \u2013 and prevent Americans from deciding for themselves whether to use a product or not.\n\nProponents of e-cigarettes have called them a helpful tool for getting tobacco users to give up conventional cigarettes \u2013 or to never get hooked on them in the first place.\n\n\u201cThis shameless attempt at backdoor prohibition will close down several hundred Michigan small businesses and could send tens of thousands of ex-smokers back to deadly combustible cigarettes,\u201d Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, said of the Michigan proposal. \u201cThese businesses and their customers will not go down without a fight. We look forward to supporting the lawsuits that now appear necessary to protect the right of adults to access these harm-reduction products.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis shameless attempt at backdoor prohibition will close down several hundred Michigan small businesses and could send tens of thousands of ex-smokers back to deadly combustible cigarettes.\u201d \u2014 Gregory Conley, president, American Vaping Association\n\nConley noted that a similar attempt to ban flavored e-cigarettes failed in New York state.\n\nENNSYLVANIA MAN IN MEDICALLY INDUCED COMA: DOCTORS 'KNOW IT'S VAPING\n\nWyden said his ban proposal was prompted by a recent multi-state outbreak of severe lung disease, including the death of a middle-aged Oregon user of vaping products. That person\u2019s symptoms were consistent with those of more than 200 other cases in at least 25 states, the Associated Press reported.\n\nELIZABETH WARREN CALLS FOR HIGHER TAXES, NRA INVESTIGATION AS PART OF GUN CONTROL PLAN\n\nBut the industry group attributes the lung illnesses to \u201ctainted black market THC products,\u201d that it says has nothing to do with the legally sold vaping devices, according to the Oregonian. THC stands for Tetrahydrocannabinol, the compound that is the main ingredient in cannabis.\n\nWyden conceded that health officials haven\u2019t reached consensus on the cause of the lung illnesses, but said he\u2019s skeptical of the way the vaping industry defends its products, the Oregonian reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI think e-cigarettes may be acting as an on-ramp to a lifetime of nicotine addiction,\u201d the senator said Wednesday. \u201cThis needs to be treated as a serious public health challenge.\u201d\n\nSharon Meieran, an emergency room physician who serves as a health commissioner in Multnomah County, Ore., said one pot of the e-cigarette product Juul is equivalent to 20 nicotine cigarettes, and is concerned by reports of high numbers of high school students engaged in vaping, the Oregonian reported.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.", "description": "Add e-cigarettes to the list of items that Democrats in Washington plan to tax.", "authors": ["Dom Calicchio", "Gregory Conley", "President", "American Vaping Association"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/20/694940094001_6074851591001_6074851046001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
