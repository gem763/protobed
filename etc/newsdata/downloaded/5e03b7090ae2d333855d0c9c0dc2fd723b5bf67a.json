He has never wavered on that point.\u2019\n\nThe state prosecutor was referring to Jay\u2019s account that Adnan strangled Hae to death and showed him the body which he helped bury.\n\nJay Wilds\u2019 interview with The Intercept\n\nWith Adnan serving a life prison sentence, Jay was able to continue living a quiet life under the radar.\n\nThat was until Serial garnered worldwide attention and thrust the spotlight onto him \u2013 and the holes in his various versions of events.\n\nThe Case Against Adnan Syed is available on Sky Crime now\n\nBut rather than continue to maintain a wall of silence, Jay made the unprecedented move of sitting down for an interview with The Intercept.\n\nHe refused to speak to Koenig for the podcast, so this was a shocking development in the case.\n\nHowever, it only exposed the inconsistencies of Jay\u2019s stories further and cast even more doubt on Adnan\u2019s guilt.\n\n\u2018I wasn\u2019t openly willing to cooperate with the police. It wasn\u2019t until they made it clear they weren\u2019t interested in my \u2018procurement\u2019 of pot that I began to open up any,\u2019 Jay told Natasha Vargas-Cooper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo how did Jay\u2019s story change again?\n\nIn this 2014 interview, Jay tells the publication that Adnan actually showed him Hae\u2019s body outside his grandmother\u2019s house.\n\nAccording to Jay, he didn\u2019t tell this version before as he didn\u2019t want to involve his grandmother.\n\n\u2018I know it didn\u2019t happen anywhere other than my grandmother\u2019s house. I remember the highway traffic to my right, and I remember standing there on the curb. I remember Adnan standing next to me,\u2019 Jay said.\n\nHae Min Lee was killed in February 1999 (Picture: Woodlawn High School)\n\nAs for the time of the burial, Jay now says it was closer to midnight than 7pm.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the murder details of which Jay is inconsistent \u2013 he tells the publication that he \u2018can\u2019t remember ever going to any kinds of functions or endeavours\u2019 with Adnan.\n\nBut there is photographic evidence of them together at a party two days after Hae\u2019s went missing.\n\nIn Sky Crime\u2019s The Case Against Adnan Syed, Rabia Chaudry challenged Jay\u2019s description of seeing Hae\u2019s body in the car boot, as it wouldn\u2019t have been consistent with the lividity evidence.\n\n\u2018Hae\u2019s lividity was symmetrical and fully frontal [suggesting she was] lying flat on her face somewhere before she was moved to Leakin Park,\u2019 Chaudry explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJay has not spoken publicly about the case since, although his ex-girlfriend was seen having a phone conversation with him in the last episode of The Case Against Adnan Syed.\n\nUndisclosed podcast co-host Collin Miller recently told Metro.co.uk that if Adnan\u2019s current appeal is unsuccessful, his legal team will look at ways of trying to contact Jay to iron out his story once again.\n\nThe Case Against Adnan Syed is available to watch on Sky Crime now.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
