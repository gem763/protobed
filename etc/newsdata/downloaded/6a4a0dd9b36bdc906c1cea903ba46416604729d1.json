It was the eighth test of a ballistic missile or unidentified projectile since July and comes as diplomatic talks between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump have largely stalled.\n\nOn Monday, North Korea said it was willing to restart those discussions after the two leaders met at the Demilitarized Zone in June and signaled that they were willing to do just that. But the North\u2019s Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui released a terse statement this week saying that the U.S needed to come to the bargaining table with new proposals to rein in the country\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile program next time or such talks could end.\n\n\u201cWe have willingness to sit with the U.S. side for comprehensive discussions of the issues we have so far taken up at the time and place to be agreed late in September,\u201d Choe said, according to the statement released by North Korean state media.\n\nNorth Korea is believed to want a bevy of guarantees to walk back its arms developments. A meeting in Vietnam in February ended abruptly after the North Koreans asked Trump to lift many heavy economic sanctions on the country in exchange for concessions that would dismantle only a small part of the country\u2019s nuclear program. But the president refused, asking for more sweeping efforts to curtail Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weaponry, according to the Times.\n\nIn April, Kim set an end-of-year deadline for the U.S. to restart talks.\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. side fingers again the worn-out scenario which has nothing to do with the new calculation method at the DPRK-U.S. working negotiation to be held with so much effort, the DPRK-U.S. dealings may come to an end,\u201d Choe said in her statement this week, according to a translation by Reuters.\n\nTrump has continued to tout his efforts to quash Kim\u2019s proclivity for dramatic tests of ICBMs and nuclear weapons, calling the North Korean dictator a \u201cfriend\u201d and declaring that Kim had a \u201cbeautiful vision for his country\u201d that only Trump could make come true.\n\nTrump said Monday that North Korea\u2019s desire to restart talks was \u201cinteresting\u201d and that he would \u201csee what happens\u201d in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, we have our hostages back, we\u2019re getting the remains of our great heroes back and we\u2019ve had no nuclear testing for a long time,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cI always say having meetings is a good thing, not a bad thing.\u201d\n\nNorth Korean policy experts speculated that launching missiles so soon after the offer of diplomacy could be an effort to signal to the White House that the country could soon continue its antagonistic weapon program should Trump fail to reach a deal with Kim in the coming months.\n\nClassic leverage play.
