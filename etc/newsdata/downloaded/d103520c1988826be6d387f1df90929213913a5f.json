That compared with the 2.3% contraction forec ast in a FactSet poll of economists and marked the ninth straight month of on-year falls.\n\nThe country logged a 136.3 billion yen ($1.26 billion) trade deficit in August compared with a Y251 billion trade deficit in the previous month.\n\nJapan's exports to China fell 12.1% on year due to weakness in demand for semiconductor-making equipment and car parts. Exports to the U.S. declined 4.4%--the first drop in 11 months--as demand for cars and automobile parts sputtered.\n\nThe results will likely add pressure to the Bank of Japan to ease monetary policy further as uncertainty over the global economy grows and as other major central banks have recently turned more dovish.\n\nThe BOJ's policy board is expected to mull the possibility of easing options at its two-day meeting ending Thursday, although economists say recent market stability may help the bank hold off on taking action this week.\n\nWrite to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com", "description": "TOKYO--Japan's exports, its main engine of growth, contracted at a much faster pace than anticipated in August, darkening the country's economic outlook and...", "authors": ["Megumi Fujikawa"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
