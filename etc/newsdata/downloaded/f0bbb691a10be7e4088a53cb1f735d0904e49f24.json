Pain is demoralizing, and you're not alone.\"\n\nABC News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton weighed in on the star's medical issues and explained the symptoms and what this reveals for others who suffer from chronic illness.\n\n\"The important thing is that it brings attention to two health conditions that affect a lot of people -- and this really helps them socially and emotionally,\" she said.\n\nWhat is Graves' disease?\n\nGraves Disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes the overproduction of thyroid hormone and affects about one in 200 people.\n\nSymptoms can include weight loss, heat intolerance, sweating or insomnia.\n\nThe disease can cause fatigue, difficulty sleeping, irritability, weight loss and bulging eyes, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nJust to clarify, I have a neurological disease AND ehlers danlos. EDS isn't a neurological disease.\n\n\ud83d\ude0d sorry for the confusion. \u2014 sia (@Sia) October 7, 2019\n\nWhat is Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?\n\nEhlers-Danlos syndrome is a genetic syndrome and connective tissue disorder that can affect bones, skin, joints and blood vessel walls.\n\nMost people with the disorder have overly flexible joints and fragile skin.\n\nDr. Ashton said that Ehlers-Danlos syndrome \"could be as rare as one in 5,000 to one in 20,000.\"\n\nHow to manage several medical issues\n\nTo manage a diagnosis appropriately, Dr. Ashton said it can be helpful to look for areas that overlap, like a Venn diagram.\n\nIn this way, Ashton said, you approach the medical issues holistically and treat the whole person rather than a body part or a diagnosis.\n\nShe added that sometimes it can be difficult to make a diagnosis when a person already has multiple conditions.\n\nAre there other aspects of the conditions to consider?\n\nThe emotional and psychological aspects of any condition are as important as the physical ones.\n\nHow to manage chronic pain\n\nWhile there are more options than ever, Ashton said its about finding what works best for the individual and finding something with low risk and high benefits.\n\nSome choices in managing chronic pain are cognitive behavioral therapy, acupuncture, medication and hypnosis.", "description": "Dr. Ashton discusses both Graves' disease Ehlers Danlos syndrome after pop singer Sia revealed her struggles with the disorders.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/sia-file-gty-ml-191007_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
