Colorado law prohibits corporations from interfering with a physician\u2019s professional judgment.\n\nMorris was fired in August after she and patient Neil Mahoney asked a judge to say whether Centura could stop her from helping him. He has sought help elsewhere and isn\u2019t part of lawsuit anymore.\n\nCentura said Tuesday it\u2019s now only an employment contract case about whether an employer can fire a worker who violates its policies.\n\nHowever, Morris attorney Jason Spitalnick says it\u2019s about whether Centura\u2019s polices can violate Colorado law.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Colorado doctor fired after tying to help a terminally ill man obtain drugs to end his life has filed an updated lawsuit that challenges her firing by a Christian hospital company.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
