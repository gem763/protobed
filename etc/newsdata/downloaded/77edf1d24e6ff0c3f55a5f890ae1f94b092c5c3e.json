Matt Gaetz (R-FL) discussed allegations of FISA abuse during the 2016 presidential election and his expectations of the forthcoming investigation.\n\nAfter deriding Hunter Biden, son of 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden as being \u201cnot exactly an international man of mystery,\u201d Gaetz said he expected former Obama Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former CIA director John Brennan implicated.\n\n\u201cI think what you see, Sean, is that Donald Trump is innocent, and the deep state is guilty. When you\u2019ve got Mr. Durham out there with an investigation that transitioned from an administrative review to a criminal investigation, that is a hat tip that there was some catalyzing event that caused the attorney general and Mr. Durham to seek the ability to have the criminal process at their disposal. I also think Durham probably frightens the deep state a lot more than even the FISA review because the Durham investigation is the investigation that goings deepest into the Obama White House. And so, that\u2019s why I think you will see people like Clapper and Brennan implicated.\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "description": "Monday on Fox News Channel's \"Hannity,\" Rep.
