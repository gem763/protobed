IT'S A BIRD? NO, IT'S A PLANE FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN\n\nLong-simmering policy disputes between Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and a slew of other candidates exploded into the open during Thursday night's debate, as the candidates -- often with raised voices -- laid bare their fundamental disagreements on \"Medicare-for-all,\" immigration and more.\n\nIntermittent efforts by some candidates to show unity and keep the heat on Trump repeatedly failed, with most striving instead to score an aggressive debate \"moment\" onstage in Houston.\n\nThe economy, which has performed well by virtually all major metrics in the past year, went largely undiscussed during the raucous three-hour debate. And, even as House Democrats made a push toward potentially impeaching the president this week, that topic conspicuously did not come up either.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLara Trump said, \u201cThis president is running on results. He's running on the fact that this country is working for people now and it didn't work for people before he took office in many respects.\"\n\nFox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "description": "Trump\u00a0campaign\u00a0senior adviser Lara Trump said Friday that\u00a0none of the presidential candidates \u201cstood out\"\u00a0at the latest Democratic presidential\u00a0debate.", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/laratrump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
