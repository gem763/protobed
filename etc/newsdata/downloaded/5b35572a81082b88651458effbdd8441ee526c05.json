His original April 2021 release date has been moved up for good behavior.\n\nThe 50-year-old Wershe spent three decades behind bars in Michigan on drug charges. He was paroled in 2017 and sent to Florida to serve time for a 2006 conviction involving a car-theft ring while he was imprisoned.\n\nWershe was already an FBI informant at age 14 and helped convict several Detroit drug kingpins. But he was arrested in 1987 with 9,000 grams (317 ounces) of cocaine and $30,000 cash.\n\nHis story is told in the 2018 movie \u201cWhite Boy Rick\u201d starring Matthew McConaughey.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A one-time FBI informant-turned-Detroit drug lord will be released from a Florida prison earlier than expected.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
