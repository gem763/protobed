The record-breaking journey saw one of Qantas' Boeing 787-9s land in Sydney at 7:42 am local time (2:12 am IST) after a nonstop journey from New York\n\nAll told, the flight took 19 hours and 15 minutes.\n\nThe flight was the first of its kind, and was being carried out as a sort of survey attempt. Part of what Qantas calls Project Sunrise, it was the first time New York and Sydney have been connected on a single flight. Long-haul flights are something Qantas does often, but this latest attempt was still pushing the limits.\n\nDon't Miss 53.1 K SHARES 25.4 K SHARES 3.2 K SHARES 4 K SHARES\n\nFlight 7879, as it was called left New York on Friday evening with 1.01 lakh kg of fuel. However, that particular jet physically can't carry a full load of passengers 16,200 km across the Pacific, so it instead flew with only 50 passengers with a crew and no cargo.\n\nOf course this needs more fleshing out, we need better planes able to make this journey before starting these kinds of flights in earnest. But the idea here with Project Sunrise is to limit jet lag of the passengers and crew on lengthy flights while also cutting down travel times.\n\nThis flight had medical experts on board to track the status of fliers, and the four-member flight crew working on rotation also wore EEG bracelets to monitor them. Now, aside from a plane that can make the flight, Qantas needs regulatory approval to commence these trips.", "description": "Most people hate long-haul flights, because though they get you to your destination faster than any other way, they really suck.
