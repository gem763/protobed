Malkin was the keynote speaker at the event, with tickets starting at $1,500.\n\nBy Sunday, though, the Trump Organization had canceled the event\u2014apparently in the face of coverage connecting Mar-a-Lago to the anti-Muslim statements made by ACT for America and its founder, Brigitte Gabriel, who claimed in 2007 that practicing Muslims \u201ccannot be loyal citizens of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis event will absolutely not be taking place at Mar-a-Lago,\u201d a Trump Organization spokesperson told The New York Times.\n\nIn a statement posted on Twitter, Gabriel blamed the cancellation on \u201cTrump attorneys\u201d and tweeted that the cancellation would cost her group \u201ca large portion of our operating budget.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegrettably, the Trump attorneys in New York caved to the Left\u2019s bullying tactics and made a decision to cancel our event within hours of the articles coming out,\u201d Gabriel said in a statement.\n\nACT for America and the Trump Organization didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Trump Organization\u2019s role in the cancellation put Malkin and other Trump supporters who are typically eager to accuse the left of attacking free speech in an awkward position. So instead of risking running afoul of the president, they blamed \u201ccancel culture,\u201d the idea that liberals silence their critics by citing their earlier remarks.\n\n\u201cThere is a chilling \u2018cancel culture\u2019 campaign being waged against patriotic journalists & activists,\u201d Malkin tweeted.\n\nOther MAGA-world personalities agreed.\n\n\u201cVery disappointing that Mar-a-Lago has joined the Cancel Culture movement,\u201d tweeted Newsmax TV host John Cardillo.\n\nBut not all of Trumpworld was so understanding.\n\nRight-wing personality Mike Cernovich claimed that \u201cTrump is banning his own supporters from his properties.\u201d Former Pizzagate promoter Jack Posobiec, now a staffer on pro-Trump One America News, asked Trump whether he knew Mar-a-Lagohad \u201cbanned\u201d Gabriel and Malkin.\n\nIn reality, neither woman appears to actually have been banned from the resort.\n\nWhile Gabriel and her group may be too extreme for Trump\u2019s Palm Beach resort, plenty of Trump acolytes have had no trouble embracing ACT for America in the past. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo received an award from the group in 2016, while Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) spoke at ACT for America\u2019s 2017 convention. Gabriel has touted her access to Trump administration officials.\n\nAfter Mar-a-Lago canceled the event, one pro-Trump media personality tried to salvage the fundraiser. Jim Hoft, the founder of far-right blog Gateway Pundit, urged his fans to contact Mar-a-Lago and ask them to change their minds.\n\n\u201cRespectfully ask them to reconsider,\u201d Hoft wrote. \u201cDon\u2019t allow SPLC demons to win!\u201d\n\nDespite Hoft\u2019s efforts, the ACT for America fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago is still canceled.", "description": "\u201cThere is a chilling \u2018cancel culture\u2019 campaign being waged against patriotic journalists & activists,\u201d Michelle Malkin, the event\u2019s keynote speaker, tweeted.", "authors": ["Will Sommer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570513727/191007-sommer-mar-la-go-tease_vxy1ok", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
