Some might think that\u2019s too much. As a writer, isn\u2019t it my job to change things up once in a while? What about \u201cprofound anguish\u201d? What about \u201coverwhelming ennui\u201d?\n\nAnd yet, something always brings me back to \u201cexistential dread\u201d, the only words that manage to encapsulate how I feel about the various news developments that get flung in our faces day after day. This week\u2019s dose of existential dread comes courtesy of Sean Spicer\u2019s first night on Dancing With The Stars, a disaster of epically cynical proportions that led to one of the most baffling Twitter exchanges I have ever witnessed (and I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard, but the standards there are pretty low).\n\nTo recap: Spicer, Donald Trump\u2019s former press secretary, made his DWTS debut on Monday night, dressed in a neon-green, frilly shirt that earned several comparisons to lettuce on social media and prompted speculation that the show\u2019s costume designer is a Democrat. But I\u2019m not really interested in roasting Spicer for his shirt, since wearing this specific garment is probably the least offensive and the most harmless thing he\u2019s ever done. In a pre-taped introductory segment, Spicer looked back on his \u201cvery tumultuous\u201d White House tenure (is \u201cvery tumultuous\u201d the new euphemism for lying about the size of the crowd at the president\u2019s inauguration and claiming that Hitler didn\u2019t use chemical weapons?) and lamented the fact that said tenure \u201cgave people a very one-dimensional look at who I am as a person\u201d (that\u2019s called being held accountable for your actions, and it tends to happen to you if you occupy one of the most prominent jobs in the nation).\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nReally, though, I\u2019m so glad that DWTS (and ABC, on which it airs) gave Spicer a chance to correct the completely unfair assumptions made about him based on his attitude during numerous televised press briefings for the president of the United States. How nice of them!\n\nAfter all this, Spicer danced the salsa with Lindsay Arnold, the professional dancer assigned to be his partner on the show. I\u2019m certainly not qualified to give any sort of feedback on anyone\u2019s dancing, so I will cede the floor to judge Bruno Tonioli, according to whom Spicer looked like he was being \u201cattacked by a swarm of wasps\u201d while his hips were \u201cset in cement\u201d.\n\nBut you know what? I don\u2019t care that Spicer\u2019s dancing wasn\u2019t that great. I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be that great! Why would a man whose professional qualifications have never involved anything close to dancing be good at salsa? What I want to know is what the man who helped kickstart the Trump administration\u2019s war on truth is doing on national television, getting praised for his \u201csense of fun\u201d in the ballroom.\n\nIn case you're wondering, Spicer and Arnold were awarded 12 points from the jury. There was no elimination on the programne\u2019s first episode, meaning we have more of this farce to look forward to, but by the end of the show, a quick scroll through Twitter memes made it seem as though Spicer\u2019s neon shirt was going to be the biggest talking point of the night.\n\nExcept of course it wasn\u2019t, because former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee (if the name sounds familiar, it\u2019s because his daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, took over Spicer\u2019s job in July 2017) had to get involved on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWanna create an emotional meltdown in Hollyweird? Vote for @seanspicer to win Dancing with the Stars tonight and every night he\u2019s on,\u201d Huckabee tweeted (oblivious to the fact, clearly stated during the show, that there was no need to vote that particular night as no one was getting eliminated). \u201c@seanspicer is a good guy and a brave sport to go on DWTS. Let\u2019s show him some love!\u201d\n\nSo this is what this has come down to. The former Governor of Arkansas is asking people to vote on a dancing contest to own the libs. Perhaps this is where we were headed all along. Perhaps every single step we\u2019ve taken since 8 November, 2016, when Donald Trump won the presidential election, was a step on the path leading us to this fateful moment in pop culture history. Perhaps this is why the Founding Fathers united the Thirteen Colonies and fought for independence in the 18th century: so that one day, a man who once compared homosexuality to drinking and swearing (I don\u2019t get it either) could urge users of a social media platform populated in part by white nationalists to influence the results of a dancing contest and trigger! The! Libs!\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there! Of course it doesn\u2019t! Spicer apparently felt such enthusiasm for Huckabee's tweet and responded in such an\u2026 exuberant tone that he has now deleted his initial message and replaced it with a more neutral one.\n\n\u201cThank you @GovMikeHuckabee. Clearly the judges aren\u2019t going to be with me,\u201d Spicer wrote in his initial, now-deleted reply. \u201cLet\u2019s send a message to #Hollywood that those of us who stand for #Christ won\u2019t be discounted. May God bless you.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Everyone Trump has fired or forced out Show all 13 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch.

If there\u2019s one thing 10 years of Bible study have taught me, it\u2019s that Jesus Christ was absolutely unwavering in his support of former White House aides' rights to cut a rug on national television.\n\n(Spicer\u2019s new message, by the way, reads: \u201cThank you @GovMikeHuckabee Really appreciate your support and prayers.\u201d)\n\nAside from the whiplash-inducing absurdity of this entire situation, the most serious concern here is that projecting this image \u2013 that of a goofy, overall nice guy who took Tonioli\u2019s excoriating feedback with a smile on his face \u2013 has been Spicer\u2019s play ever since he left the White House. Even throughout his Trump tenure, he would sometimes laugh with the same journalists he alienated during his briefings. Sure, Spicer seems to tell us, he was a bit aggressive at times. Sure, he lied a little every once in a while. But that was all for the job! That\u2019s not who he is! And now that he\u2019s out of the White House, you have to look past the lying and the contributing to the destruction of this country, into his heart!\n\nExcept: No, we don\u2019t. No one\u2019s owed a public platform. Spicer\u2019s attempt at a rehabilitation tour misses a crucial point about the impact of his time at the White House: it\u2019s not about whether he, personally, is a nice guy. It\u2019s about the people who were hurt by what he did and who continue to be hurt by the administration he helped bolster. No amount of salsa, tango or cha-cha-ch\u00e1 can undo that.", "description": "I use the phrase\u00a0\u201cexistential dread\u201d\u00a0pretty regularly these days.
