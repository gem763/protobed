Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who is heading up the impeachment inquiry in the House. \u201cWas this person SPYING on the U.S. President? Big Consequences!\u201d he warned the person who blew the whistle on his extortionary phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now,\u201d he said at a private event with diplomatic officials last Thursday.\n\nThese missives might seem to distract from the substance of the Ukraine matter, which perhaps is what Mr. Trump intends. They muffle the roar of misconduct and seize control of the narrative. But the threats can\u2019t be ignored, because in one respect, they are the substance. The president stands accused of attempting to strong-arm another nation to sabotage a political rival, and with trying to cover it up. Now he means to menace Congress, anyone else with knowledge of his misdeeds and the public into not holding him to account.\n\nWhat whistleblower in the future will come forward knowing the reward will be demonization and even potential prosecution? What does this say to aides or other officials who could speak to investigators as they probe the matter? Most Republicans are already far too reluctant to condemn Mr. Trump\u2019s actions, much less do anything about them. Democrats, too, fear how far a man who cares nothing for the rule of law will go to mobilize his supporters against anything that imperils his presidency. Now, he is showing them.\n\nAlready, amateur Internet \u201csleuths\u201d are scrambling to unmask the person who wrote the complaint released late last week. Two pro-Trump activists claim they are offering a $50,000 reward for the details. The president himself told reporters Monday that \u201cwe\u2019re trying to find out\u201d the whistleblower\u2019s identity. Mr. Trump has winked at violence before. No wonder a lawyer for the whistleblower wrote to leaders of the congressional intelligence committees Saturday to say there were \u201cserious concerns for our client\u2019s personal safety, as well as for others connected to this matter.\u201d\n\nThe only response to the president\u2019s attempt to cow the country into letting him get away with abusing his office is not to let him get away with abusing his office. Congress and the nation must make Mr. Trump answer for his undemocratic intimidation tactics and for the bigger scandal he is using them to obscure.", "description": "The threats can\u2019t be ignored, because in one respect, they are the substance of the issue.", "authors": ["Editorial Board", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4sYHVNyxZTNjtVXq-AjpjColfbo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YF5LHLHDW4I6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
