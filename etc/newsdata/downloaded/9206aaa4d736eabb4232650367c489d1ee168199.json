Float \u2018em. Fly \u2018em,\u201d he said of Sen. Bernard Sanders\u2019 plan to tax the 400 richest Americans at a 97% rate. \u201cRun \u2018em up the old flagpole. See who salutes. Look, in the end you\u2019ve got millionaires arguing with millionaires over who hates the millionaires the most.\u201d\n\nThe former \u201cSomebody\u2019s Gotta Do It\u201d host then discussed his life in California and a report on \u201cthe exodus this year as a result of a thirteen-and-a-half percent state tax and some other tweaks to the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlike anything they\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it\u2019s convenient. It\u2019s kind of fun to hate the rich and all but, in the end, they\u2019re just people and they\u2019re going to do the math and they\u2019re going to go to where the math is better.\u201d\n\nMr. Rowe also said that plans to give people $1,000 per month to counteract automation may have unintended consequences.\n\n\u201cWhy not $2,000? Why not $3,000?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou can\u2019t ignore the human condition. We\u2019re fundamentally lazy people. We have to be taught, I think, not to be lazy. \u2026 If you give me a choice \u2014 and I don\u2019t see myself as lazy \u2014 but if you give me a choice of the easy way or the hard way I can\u2019t help it: I\u2019m going to default to the easy way. \u2026 Once you say, OK, \u2018free\u2019 money, the next question has to be \u2018Why not more?\u2019\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
