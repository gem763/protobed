At 12:20 a.m. on Thursday, the president fired off a tweet in an attempt to clarify his comments, writing that he had \u201ckiddingly\u201d brought up Colorado to suggest that non-border states could also benefit from the wall.\n\n(Kiddingly) We\u2019re building a Wall in Colorado\u201d(then stated, \u201cwe\u2019re not building a Wall in Kansas but they get the benefit of the Wall we\u2019re building on the Border\u201d) refered to people in the very packed auditorium, from Colorado & Kansas, getting the benefit of the Border Wall! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 24, 2019\n\nThat convoluted 47-word missive seemed to only fuel more mockery, though.\n\nRussian bots tweet more coherently than this. https://t.co/q8WvIvtNjW \u2014 W. Kamau Bell (@wkamaubell) October 24, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s original head-scratching remarks about the border wall came roughly 40 minutes into his hour-long speech Wednesday afternoon as he addressed the crowd at an energy conference in Pittsburgh.\n\nAD\n\nThe president had just finished boasting about his administration\u2019s tax cuts when he abruptly pivoted to predicting that he would win New Mexico, which hasn\u2019t gone Republican since 2004, according to Vox.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou know why we\u2019re going to win New Mexico? Because they want safety on their border and they didn\u2019t have it,\u201d Trump said, drawing applause that only became louder as he declared that the wall would be built there, as well in Texas \u2014 and Colorado.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not building a wall in Kansas,\u201d he continued, referencing Colorado\u2019s eastern neighbor, \u201cbut they get the benefit of the walls that we just mentioned.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump announces he's building a border wall in Colorado. He gets a standing ovation. #9NEWS #copolitics pic.twitter.com/H9fxzr18uC \u2014 Kyle Clark (@KyleClark) October 23, 2019\n\nAt first, people had questions.\n\n\u201cUmmm, Colorado? Is Wyoming invading?\u201d one person asked on Twitter.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIs that to keep out the Nebraskans or those pesky folks from Wyoming?\u201d another wondered.\n\nWe're building a wall in Colorado?

Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) got in on the roasting by sharing a Sharpie-edited map of the United States, a reference to Trump\u2019s infamous Hurricane Dorian debacle. In September, Trump came under fire for displaying a chart forecasting the path of the hurricane that had been altered using black marker.\n\nAD\n\nSen. Michael F. Bennet, a Democratic presidential candidate from Colorado, and the state\u2019s former governor John Hickenlooper also hit back at Trump.\n\nAD\n\nLet me repeat: There isn\u2019t an elected leader from the state of Colorado who would support using eminent domain to steal the property of our farmers and ranchers to build a medieval wall. pic.twitter.com/2GAxAgIV5c \u2014 Michael Bennet (@SenatorBennet) October 23, 2019\n\nIn a tweet tagging Democrats from New Mexico, Hickenlooper wrote, \u201cDo one of you want to break it to @realDonaldTrump that Colorado\u2019s border is with New Mexico, not Mexico \u2026 or should I?\u201d\n\nOn CNN Wednesday night, host Don Lemon echoed Hickenlooper, stressing that the two locations are \u201cnot the same thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cColorado?\u201d Lemon asked incredulously after he got his laughter under control. \u201cWho\u2019s going to pay for that one?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter was rife with biting commentary.\n\n\u201cI took my SATs on ecstasy, and even then I knew where Colorado was located,\u201d comedian Chelsea Handler tweeted.\n\nIs Colorado on the border?! pic.twitter.com/0urD4E6C5Y \u2014 Zach Braff (@zachbraff) October 24, 2019\n\nSome implied that Trump\u2019s gaffe could be the product of knowledge gap.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe geography department at Trump University was severely underfunded,\u201d a Twitter user wrote.\n\nAD\n\nHe assumes Colorado borders Mexico because everything square and west of New York is interchangeable to him. https://t.co/rHj3dG7aH3 \u2014 Jason Kander (@JasonKander) October 24, 2019\n\nPerhaps, one person suggested, the Colorado remark was intended as a distraction. Earlier in the day, Trump faced criticism for tweeting that \u201cNever Trumper Republicans\u201d are \u201chuman scum.\u201d Republican House members also stormed a closed-door meeting on Wednesday in a secure facility on Capitol Hill, delaying the testimony of an impeachment witness.\n\n\u201cMr. President, #humanscum is still trending and more republicans are calling for your resignation and/or impeachment. Additionally, you know our supporters in the house? The public wants to #LockThemUp and #ArrestGaetz\"\n\n\n\n\u201dHold my beer, I'm going to call Colorado a border state.\u201d \u2014 David Leavitt (@David_Leavitt) October 24, 2019\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cWell this is awkward ...\u201d tweeted Colorado Gov.
