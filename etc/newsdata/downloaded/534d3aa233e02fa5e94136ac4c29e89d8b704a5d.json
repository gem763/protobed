That triggered a remarkable response.\n\nConservative media lit up in unison. Fox News and the Wall Street Journal editorial page, for instance, attacked us for advocating \u201ccourt packing,\u201d something we did not advocate. The Journal used language so similar to a separate National Review op-ed that it issued an unusual editor\u2019s note denying plagiarism. Then, all 53 Republicans in the Senate cranked out a letter to the court\u2019s clerk decrying our brief. What hoopla.\n\nSo, what did we actually say?\n\nWe said this: From 2005 through the fall term of 2018, the Roberts court issued 73 5-to-4 partisan decisions benefiting big Republican donor interests: allowing corporations to spend unlimited money in elections; hobbling pollution regulations; enabling attacks on minority voting rights; curtailing labor\u2019s right to organize; denying workers the ability to challenge employers in court; and, of course, expanding the NRA\u2019s gun rights \u201cproject.\u201d It\u2019s a pattern.\n\nOf course, in other decisions during that period, such as the 2015 same-sex marriage ruling, a Republican appointed justice joined the liberals. But in its run of 73 partisan 5-to-4 cases, the Republican majority routinely broke traditionally conservative legal principles, such as respect for precedent or \u201coriginalist\u201d reading of the Constitution. They even went on remarkable fact-finding expeditions, violating traditions of appellate adjudication.\n\nIn their letter, our Republican colleagues invoked Alexander Hamilton\u2019s vision of the \u201ccomplete independence of the courts.\u201d We\u2019re glad they did, because our purpose in calling attention to this pattern is to help restore the judicial independence Hamilton envisioned.\n\nThe big-donor takeover of the federal courts begins, as reported by The Post, with a sprawling network of organizations funded by at least a quarter-billion dollars of largely anonymous money, and spearheaded by the Federalist Society\u2019s Leonard Leo. We saw this network\u2019s hand in the confirmations of Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh. One unnamed donor gave $17 million to the Leo-affiliated Judicial Crisis Network to block the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland and to support Gorsuch; then a donor \u2014 perhaps the same one \u2014 gave another $17 million to prop up Kavanaugh. The NRA joined in the effort, too, spending $1 million on an ad campaign supporting the Kavanaugh confirmation to \u201cbreak the tie\u201d (again, the NRA\u2019s words) in gun cases.\n\nWith its judges in place, the network lobbies the court with anonymously funded amicus briefs, signaling how the judges should vote. In one case, Janus v. AFSCME, one anonymously funded group backed 13 different amicus briefs fighting public-sector unions\u2019 right to organize. The decision came as expected, 5 to 4, throwing out 40 years of settled labor law.\n\nRepublicans and their big donors now see the court as part of their team. They can achieve political gains there that they cannot win in Congress. The supposedly apolitical nature of the court partly protects these political gains from critique. And after 73 partisan victories, they\u2019ve had a hell of a run. That explains why our brief provoked such an outcry from their side.\n\nBut Americans can smell a rat. The pattern is too distinct to ignore. We warned the court of polls showing that the public\u2019s faith in the court\u2019s independence is eroding. Americans becoming wise to their game is surely concerning to the anonymous funders. Corporate, polluter and partisan donor interests want the eyes of the nation turned elsewhere, while their \u201cprojects\u201d play out in captured courts.\n\nSo the right-wing media eruption tried to deflect our plainly stated concerns by suggesting we want to change the number of justices on the court. That\u2019s not what we\u2019ve argued. My own calls for judicial reform have been for transparency around the dark money behind judicial nominations and amicus briefs; for improved ethics reporting and a court code of ethics; and for justices to follow principles they espouse at confirmation hearings such as respect for precedent, judicial modesty, deference to duly passed laws of Congress, letting fact-finders find the facts, and calling balls and strikes apolitically. None of that seems unreasonable.\n\nThe right-wing eruption offered no defense of why a multimillion-dollar secret influence apparatus should be involved in selecting justices and campaigning for their confirmation and filing anonymous amicus briefs. There was no defense of the court systematically overturning precedents or inviting challenges to well-established doctrines or finding specious facts or discarding appellate norms; and there was no defense of the run of 73 partisan decisions.\n\nInstead, we saw precisely the howl of coordinated, multiple-mouthpiece misdirection you would expect to hear from big donors whose scheme to capture the Supreme Court for one team was suddenly exposed and is now at risk.\n\nRead more:\n\nMarc A.
