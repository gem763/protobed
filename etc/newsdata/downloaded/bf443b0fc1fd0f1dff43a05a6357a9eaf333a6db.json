They have now declared a curfew and severe punishments for anyone not going to work, this is how they fight us. We will stay here until the last day, even if there are a thousand martyrs,\" one protester said.\n\nThe unrest, driven by discontent over economic hardship and deep-seated corruption, has broken nearly two years of relative stability in Iraq, which from 2003 to 2017 endured a foreign occupation, civil war and an Islamic State insurgency.\n\nThree people were killed in Baghdad on Monday and 224 wounded. Security and medical sources said the deaths resulted from security forces launching tear gas canisters directly at the heads of protesters.\n\nA fourth person was killed in the holy Shi'ite city of Kerbala and 53 wounded, including six in critical condition, after police used live fire to disperse protesters, security and medical sources said. The cause of death was a bullet to the head, one medical source said.\n\nSome 235 people have been killed overall in the disturbances this month.\n\nSecurity forces on Monday fired tear gas at school and university students who defied a warning from Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi and joined thousands in Baghdad protesting against his government.\n\nA spokesman for the premier, whose position is increasingly precarious in the face of the stiffest challenge since he took office a year ago, said on Sunday that anyone disrupting work or school days would be severely punished.\n\nSoldiers were seen beating high school students with batons in two Baghdad districts. A Defence Ministry statement condemned the incident and said the soldiers did not represent the Iraqi army as a whole. It did not say if they would be punished.\n\nPopulist Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who backs parliament's largest bloc and helped bring Abdul Mahdi's fragile coalition government to power, called for early elections shortly after the curfew was announced.\n\n\"Abdul Mahdi must go to parliament and announce early elections to be overseen by the United Nations,\" Sadr said in a statement. He called on existing political parties not to run.\n\nMass street protests in Baghdad and other cities in the south flared at the start of the month and resumed on Friday after a pause of about two weeks.\n\nThousands of protesters gathered in Tahrir Square on Sunday, defying a bloody crackdown that had killed scores over the previous two days, and an overnight raid by security forces seeking to disperse them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"BUNCH OF THIEVES\"\n\nProtesters feared a repeat on Sunday night but no raid transpired, rather only the occasional burst of tear gas. Demonstrators turned up in large numbers again on Monday.\n\nAfter a weekend in which at least 74 people were killed, a brief reprieve from violence came when no deaths were recorded in Baghdad or elsewhere overnight, before it was broken later on Monday.\n\nVideos on social media showed security forces on Monday firing tear gas at students in one Baghdad district as the protests spread to other pockets of the capital. One video showed a group of schoolgirls running and screaming. Students in five other provinces, mostly in the south, also joined protests.\n\n\"We have come out today to demand our rights, which have been taken away since 2003 when the American government handed us over to a bunch of thieves,\" said Abbas al-Hamzawi, an archaeology student in the southern city of Diwaniya, referring to the U.S.-led invasion that year that ousted Saddam Hussein.\n\n\"We are here today for freedom, dignity, and a good life. We demand the fall of the regime, the suspension of the constitution, and an emergency government,\" he said.\n\nOPEC member Iraq boasts vast oil wealth, but many Iraqis live in poverty or have limited access to clean water, electricity, basic health care and education. The country is still struggling to recover from years of conflict since 2003.", "description": "Iraq declared a curfew in Baghdad on Monday as four people were killed and 277 injured in the fourth day of anti-government protests, and the coalition government's most powerful erstwhile supporter called for early elections.
