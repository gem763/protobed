Twitter isn\u2019t us. Twitter isn\u2019t the rank-and-file Democrat. It is not even most liberals. But they don\u2019t do it.\n\n\u201cThis is the Democrats\u2019 race to lose,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf you run on taking away people\u2019s health care and taxing them too much and taking away all their guns and transwomen get abortion rights \u2014 I think that came up in the first debate \u2014 I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to win this election. I think the only way the Democrat loses is to convince a lot of people that they are actually scarier or crazier than Trump, which is not easy to do, but I think they can.\u201d\n\nMr. Maher added that while he likes Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren, he believes she is a candidate whose far-left policies could scare off voters.\n\n\u201cI love Elizabeth Warren, but she does scare me a little bit because, again, all we have to do to win this election is not be scarier to people than Donald Trump,\u201d he said, according to a transcript by NewsBusters.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
