Amid the turmoil, Trump\u2019s argument may be that he does not want to be relevant, at least in the hot spot that is war-ravaged Syria. He routinely blames the Obama administration, from which he inherited America\u2019s checkered legacy of involvement in the Syrian war, including its firm alliance with the main faction of Syrian Kurds. Better, Trump tweeted, to not have to deal with it at all. And to that end, he could be getting his wish.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs part of a deal with the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian Democratic Forces \u2014 or SDF, the Syrian Kurdish-led faction backed by the United States but seen by Turkey as the analogue of an outlawed Kurdish separatist group within its own borders \u2014 invited in regime forces to help thwart Turkey and its militant proxies.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in years, Syrian government forces arrived in the towns of Tabqa, on the outskirts of Raqqa, and Ain Issa, which served as the headquarters of the Kurdish-led autonomous administration in northeast Syria, about 20 miles from the Turkish border,\u201d my colleagues reported. \u201cImages published by the official Syrian Arab News Agency, or SANA, showed government troops arriving atop pickup trucks and waving Syrian flags.\u201d\n\nBoth the Syrian Kurds and Turkey accused the other of releasing Islamic State detainees from detention camps as battles raged. Europeans fretted on the sidelines, bemoaning Trump\u2019s decision to pull out. \u201cWe don\u2019t have magic powers\u201d to stop the Turkish assault, said Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell, who is slated to become the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief later this year. \u201cIf the American troops wouldn\u2019t have withdrawn, this attack would have been impossible. The American troop withdrawal was a condition in order to make the attack possible.\u201d\n\nBy Monday evening, attention fell on a possible clash between Syrian regime forces and Turkish-affiliated fighters as they both converged on the town of Manbij, where a detachment of U.S. troops was preparing to hastily depart. The whirlwind of events marked the sudden reconfiguring of the Syrian battlefield, with the Americans exiting the fray, the Turks hoping to assert their authority over the Syrian borderlands, the Kurds submitting to Damascus, and the regime further consolidating its control of a war-ravaged nation. The scenes in Riyadh on Monday of Russian President Vladimir Putin meeting Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman only seemed to add to the growing impression of a geopolitical rug getting pulled from under American feet.\n\nIn the fog of war, at least one thing is becoming all too clear: The half-decade-old experiment of an autonomous Syrian Kurdish enclave \u2014 backed by American arms and air power \u2014 has come to a shuddering halt. Foreign journalists reporting in territory once controlled by the SDF fled to Iraq in order not to fall afoul of the Assad regime, which has blacklisted reporters entering the country in rebel-held areas. Syrian Kurdish officials have already accepted the necessity of siding with Assad and his allies in Russia and Iran.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe know that we would have to make painful compromises with Moscow and Bashar al-Assad if we go down the road of working with them,\u201d wrote Mazloum Abdi, commander of the SDF, in an op-ed for Foreign Policy. \u201cBut if we have to choose between compromises and the genocide of our people, we will surely choose life for our people.\u201d\n\nAbdi stressed that he didn\u2019t expect the United States to be the \u201cworld police,\u201d but had hoped Trump would use Washington\u2019s \u201cleverage to mediate a sustainable peace between us and Turkey.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem that will happen. Trump said in a statement on Monday that he was \u201cfully prepared to swiftly destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path.\u201d But critics suggested the proposed punitive measures \u2014 including a steel tariff and targeted sanctions on Turkish individuals \u2014 were relatively light and symbolic. Moreover, Trump has also started to parrot Ankara\u2019s arguments about the SDF, dwelling on their connections to a U.S.-listed terrorist group and ignoring the tremendous sacrifice they made on behalf of the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTrump has played down the Kurdish relationship as purely transactional. They had been given a lot of money and equipment, he pointed out,\u201d observed the Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger. \u201cBut it was not transactional for the soldiers who fought at each others\u2019s shoulders, and the civilians killed as a result of the Trump-Erdogan understanding. The U.S. has let the Kurds down before, but Trump\u2019s sheer callousness has made it hard to imagine that this betrayal will be forgiven in the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\n....Kurds may be releasing some to get us involved. Easily recaptured by Turkey or European Nations from where many came, but they should move quickly. Big sanctions on Turkey coming! Do people really think we should go to war with NATO Member Turkey? Never ending wars will end! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2019\n\nThat seeming callousness is a signature theme of Trump\u2019s foreign policy. \u201cI\u2019ve always looked at the approach the administration takes as very transactional and very short-term in nature,\u201d former senator Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told my colleagues over the weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s almost seeking headlines for the very next day, but not really thinking through the longer-term impact on our \u00adcountry.\u201d\n\nBut the developments of the past couple of months point to a longer-term failure. The Post\u2019s deputy editorial page editor, Jackson Diehl, argued that an unraveling of Trump\u2019s agenda began in early September, starting with his abrupt scrapping of a summit with the Afghan Taliban. It continued with Iran\u2019s refusal to be cowed by Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign and engage in talks with the U.S. president. Then, in separate meetings with North Korean and Chinese interlocutors over denuclearization and trade, respectively, the White House could, at best, only hail cosmetic signs of progress.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe uproar in Washington over President Trump\u2019s corruption in Ukraine and malfeasance in Syria has obscured a broader story,\u201d wrote Diehl. \u201cIn little more than a month, virtually every other foreign policy initiative the Trump administration has pursued has imploded \u2014 thanks mostly to the president\u2019s increasingly unhinged behavior.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
