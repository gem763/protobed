It was in that very environment, three years ago, that things started to go so badly wrong for the Yorkshireman.\n\nWillett, England\u2019s latest winner of the BMW PGA Championship, arrived at Hazeltine in 2016 inside the world\u2019s top 10 having won the Masters five months earlier. Unwanted attentions provided by a vitriolic blog \u2013 penned by Willett\u2019s brother \u2013 ruined his Ryder Cup debut; whether linked or not, he subsequently suffered a catastrophic loss of form. When heading to Wentworth for this tournament last year, he was ranked 462nd in the world.\n\nDanny Willett ends long wait with DP World Tour Championship victory Read more\n\nVictory in Dubai last November endorsed the sense he was in the midst of a resurgence. Success in the European Tour\u2019s flagship event will propel him back inside the world\u2019s top 50, possibly as high as 31. Already it would be a surprise if the 31-year-old does not form part of Padraig Harrington\u2019s contingent as Europe launch their Ryder Cup defence at Whistling Straits next year. It may be too soon to be speaking of another upward curve in Willett\u2019s fluctuating career or it may already be just that.\n\n\u201cI had an undying want to get back there [to the top],\u201d Willett said. \u201cI was willing to change whatever had to be changed and I think that\u2019s pretty hard to do. It\u2019s hard to jump full throttle into something that you\u2019re not quite sure if it\u2019s going to work out or not. I was able to jump in there and I had the correct people around me.\n\n\u201cAll the work that we\u2019ve put in has come forward. To come down the stretch today and enjoy it was beautiful. There was a long time where I didn\u2019t enjoy this at all.\u201d\n\nWillett prevailed relatively comfortably in the end, by three shots from Jon Rahm, with who he started level. A closing round of 67 afforded Willett a 20-under-par aggregate; 68 was his highest score of the week.\n\nThere was only brief cause for him to fret. When taking to the 11th on Sunday, two shots to the good over Rahm, the leader found trees and heather with consecutive shots. He appeared to jar his wrist when playing from the latter. That Willett limited the damage to a bogey, thanks to a 50ft putt, felt like a defining moment; Rahm could not reel in the champion at any point over the closing stretch and his hopes ended when he found the water with his second shot on the 18th. \u201cIt\u2019s a little painful,\u201d Rahm admitted. \u201cBut nothing a good dinner and a bottle of wine can\u2019t fix.\u201d Willett had taken painkillers to cure his own, brief pain.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s Christiaan Bezuidenhout claimed third at minus 16. The American pair of Billy Horschel and Patrick Reed justified trips across the Atlantic with a share of fourth, one shot further back.\n\nRory McIlroy added a 67 to rounds of 76, 69 and 65 meaning Thursday stood out as somewhat freakish in the Northern Irishman\u2019s tournament. Next for McIlroy, after a share of ninth place, is the Dunhill Links in Scotland from Thursday, where he will play in the company of his father.\n\n\u201cI think my dad will be happier than I am because he at least has a partner now that\u2019s playing pretty well,\u201d said McIlroy. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to it. It\u2019s a very relaxed week. I\u2019m going to go up there and have a good time. St Andrews is a great town.\n\n\u201cI think if you take these pro-ams too seriously, you start to get frustrated with how long you\u2019re out there and all that sort of stuff. So we will try to keep it lighthearted and hopefully that\u2019s the key to playing some good golf.\u201d", "description": "Danny Willett, who was 462nd in the world in May 2018, said it was a beautiful feeling as he beat Jon Rahm by three shots to climb inside the world\u2019s top 35", "authors": ["Ewan Murray"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f07f81984abd8154b76cadc0e59f15ac26de5f3/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6db6273c428afcbcba85d6328158bc0a", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
