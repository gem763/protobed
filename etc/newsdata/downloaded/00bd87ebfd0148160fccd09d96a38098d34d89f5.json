That goes a long way, and we say thank you, Nigel.\u201d\n\nTurning to the subject of Boris Johnson\u2019s deal directly, Mr Paisley recognised Brexit \u201cfatigue\u201d might be pushing some Brexiteers to accepting it, but urged them to think again: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, any deal isn\u2019t good enough. We need the right deal. We need a deal we can believe in, and we need the deal we voted for and the sooner we get that the better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI implore those who say to us \u2018just accept this deal, help us get over the line and get to the next phase\u2019\u2026 we cannot recklessly treat the Union and leave a part of the Union behind or in a state of limbo, which is exactly what would happen in Northern Ireland [under the terms of Boris Johnson\u2019s deal],\u201d he claimed.\n\nPaisley, whose Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is committed to Brexit but first and foremost to maintaining Northern Ireland\u2019s position within the United Kingdom \u2014 a stance which was supported by a large majority of the Province\u2019s residents in the last referendum on the subject in 1973 \u2014 insisted that his countrymen must \u201cleave [the European Union] on the same terms as everyone else, that we have the same customs arrangements, the same Single Market arrangements, the same VAT arrangements as the rest of the United Kingdom\u2026 those conditions have been thrown back in our teeth [by Johnson\u2019s deal], and that\u2019s why we so strongly object \u2014 because what is being delivered to us will change part of the Union, it will leave part of the Union behind.\u201d\n\nPaisley was scathing of the Conservative Party, which has relied on the DUP for a precarious House of Commons majority since the 2017 snap election, quoting Edwardian era Ulster Unionist leader Lord Carson\u2019s \u201cprophetic speech\u201d on the attitude of the Tories towards using Northern Ireland to achieve its own goals while having no care for its loyal residents at length:\n\nWhat a fool I was. I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster, and so was Ireland, in the political game that was to get the Conservative Party into power. And of all the men in 45my experience that I think are the most loathsome it is those who will sell their friends for the purpose of conciliating their enemies, and, perhaps, still worse, the men who climb up a ladder into power of which even I may have been part of a humble rung, and then, when they have got into power, kick the ladder away without any concern for the pain, or injury, or mischief, or damage that they do to those who have helped them to gain power.\n\nAdding his lament to that of Lord Carson a century earlier, Mr Paisley concluded: \u201c100 years of history tells unionism one thing: we are not disposable. We are not kicked away so easily, we are here to stay. No surrender.\u201d\n\nNigel Farage, too, expressed his regret that rather than holding a political meeting on the to celebrate Britain finally leaving the European Union, they were instead having to urge Leave voters to recognise that Brexit \u201cwill not be delivered by this sell-out from the British Prime Minister.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo many commentators, so many journalists today saying what a wonderful new deal it is, clearly haven\u2019t read it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Government is doing all it can to get this wretched treaty through. They are doing it because they believe it will give Boris a big short-term bounce in the polls because he can say he got Brexit done.\n\n\u201cBut of course, at some point the country will wake up to some of the points I\u2019ve told you tonight, and not forgive them for it.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019d say to those MPs [who are] examining their consciences: don\u2019t make the same mistake as those who went before you made with Maastricht. Stick to your principles. Know the country is behind you and tomorrow put country before party.\u201d\n\nThe DUP will vote against the new deal when it is put to the House of Commons on October 19th.\n\nAddressing a Brexit Party rally Ian Paisley makes a thinly veiled dig at Boris Johnson: \u201cWhich part of Unionist do you not understand?\u201d \u2014 Kate Devlin (@_katedevlin) October 18, 2019", "description": "Ian Paisley Jr, the son of firebrand DUP founder The Rev Ian Paisley, vowed there will be \"no surrender\" to an EU deal which divides the UK.", "authors": ["Oliver Jj Lane", "Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/03/ulster.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
