The boys are champing at the bit to get involved, get in the mixer and get playing.\u201d\n\nWales have beaten South Africa in five of the their last six meetings, including four successive victories.\n\nAsked about his own form ahead of another tilt at the Springboks, North added: \u201cMixed, if I\u2019m honest.\n\n\u201cObviously this is the biggest stage and where you want to be playing your best rugby.\n\nGeorge North in action against France in the quarter-final (Ashley Western/PA)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not been playing badly, but not to where I want to be. But to see where we are now in a semi-final and to be part of it is something special.\n\n\u201cSo from my point of view we\u2019ve just got to stay positive, keep grafting and hopefully I will get a few more touches.\n\n\u201cThese are the games that you do all the hard graft for, the months of preparation, the altitude camps, the heat camps, every other camp we\u2019ve been on up until now.\n\n\u201cTo get to a semi-final is massive. It\u2019s certainly one of the biggest games of my career and my life. Hopefully, we can go out and perform and have an even bigger one next week.\u201d\n\nInjuries have sidelined full-back Liam Williams and back-row forward Josh Navidi from the semi-final, but centre Jonathan Davies has recovered from a knee problem to partner Hadleigh Parkes in midfield.\n\nFIRST LOOK \ud83d\udd34 Wales' team for the #RWC2019 semi-final against South Africa at #RWCYokohama Mi fydd @Gar_Davies9 yn ennill ei 50fed cap yn erbyn y Boks. #HWFN pic.twitter.com/HxPiWTbOZs \u2014 Welsh Rugby Union \ud83c\udfc9 (@WelshRugbyUnion) October 25, 2019\n\nLeigh Halfpenny, meanwhile, takes over from Williams and Ross Moriarty packs down at number eight instead of Navidi.\n\nWales assistant coach Stephen Jones said: \u201cJon is a good communicator, who does his role very well. It\u2019s great to have him fully fit and ready to go.\n\n\u201cHe is fit and he has trained very well. He\u2019s hitting the ball well, he is getting into position quickly. He has got the green light and he is good to go.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to lose Liam, but we\u2019ve got Leigh Halfpenny coming in, who is a wonderful player.\n\n\u201cHe brings a different dimension to the back-line. Look at Leigh\u2019s game, aerially he is very good, his work-rate behind the defensive line is top drawer.\u201d", "description": "Wales will reach their first World Cup final if they beat South Africa in Yokohama.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/08/wire-20209250-1572073752-482_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
