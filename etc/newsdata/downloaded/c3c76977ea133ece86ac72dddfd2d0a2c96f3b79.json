They committed a mind-numbing 18 penalties and showed little discipline during a 43-13 loss that has created doubt about a talented team that might not be as good everyone thinks.\n\nCleveland had more yards in penalties (182) than rushing (102). The suspect offensive line leaked; tackle Greg Robinson got ejected for kicking Titans safety Kenny Vaccaro in the head; the defensive line didn\u2019t live up to its billing; and star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr.\u2019s debut was most notable because he played while wearing a $250,000 watch.\n\nAll in all, a flop.\n\nOn Monday, first-year coach Freddie Kitchens cautioned against an overreaction to the debacle.\n\n\u201cIt is one game in a 16-game schedule,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very disappointed in the lack of discipline that we showed, the loss of composure that we showed at times, and just overall not doing a good enough job from a coaching perspective and a player perspective to get the job done in a positive manner.\u201d\n\nAs the final seconds ticked off the clock Sunday, the few hardy Browns fans who hung around until the bitter end booed in a scene that\u2019s been repeated numerous times in recent years.\n\nThese Browns are supposed to be different.\n\nThey\u2019re not yet.\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThe Browns showed their firepower by taking the opening kickoff - with Mayfield luckily dodging an interception on his first throw - and driving for a touchdown in the first five minutes. They even overcame a 15-yard penalty and Mayfield used his full complement of weapons before backup Dontrell Hilliard scored on a 4-yard run.\n\nThis is what Kitchens has in mind for his offense: high tempo, chunk plays, electric.\n\nThe opening possession was as good as it got as the Browns converted just 1 of 10 third downs.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe lack of discipline was alarming. The 18 penalties were the most by the Browns since 1951, and it would have been 20 if the Titans hadn\u2019t declined two.\n\nKitchens harped on mental mistakes during the preseason, but the message didn\u2019t sink in. The Browns made silly ones, and a few far more worrying with Robinson getting tossed and defensive end Myles Garrett being flagged for swatting Titans tight end Delanie Walker across the head.\n\nThe Browns were guilty of five offensive holding penalties. The defense committed four infractions on Tennessee\u2019s first TD drive.\n\nBy contrast, the Titans had six penalties.\n\nRobinson will be fined, not suspended, for the blow to Vaccaro\u2019s head. He said it was unintentional.\n\n\u201cI hurt the team, honestly, and I feel like if I could have it back, I would do things differently,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cBut it was basically just a reaction. I couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nIt\u2019s never good when the punter outshines the rest of the team, but rookie Jamie Gillan lived up to his \u201cScottish Hammer\u201d nickname and pounded the ball. Gillan averaged 46.6 yards on five punts, knocking three inside the 20-yard line.\n\nKitchens was also pleased with rookie cornerback Greedy Williams, who started over Terrance Mitchell.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nThere was concern about Cleveland\u2019s offensive line before the opener, and those worries have increased.\n\nRobinson\u2019s ejection was followed by his replacement, Kendall Lamm, hurting his knee. That forced Kitchens to move Chris Hubbard from right tackle to left and play Justin McCray, who had only been with the team for a week.\n\nBut even at full speed, the group didn\u2019t open holes or keep Mayfield from harm.\n\nINJURED\n\nMayfield suffered a hand injury, which is not believed to be serious. However, Kitchens hesitated when asked if the QB will miss practice time this week.\n\n\u201cI am pretty sure that he will be fine,\u201d Kitchens said. \u201cI can\u2019t say anything definitive right now as far as missing practice time, but I am pretty certain he will be fine.\u201d\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n58 - The number of consecutive games Beckham has made at least three receptions, the third-longest streak in league history.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nMove on. One of Kitchens\u2019 favorite expressions is: \u201cThe rear view mirror is a lot smaller than the windshield. I prefer to look through the windshield.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot coming at the Browns, who whether they like it or not have a huge target placed on them because of outside expectations.\n\nThe Titans reveled in making the Browns lose their composure. There\u2019s no doubt other teams will try the same, beginning next Monday night at the Jets.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Baker Mayfield was hurting following a shocking, stinging loss.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Withers"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/titans_browns_football_79578_c0-599-1305-1359_s1770x1032.jpg?dfa107ebe306ef0eae4e28ab6f02f71c0d363de3", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
