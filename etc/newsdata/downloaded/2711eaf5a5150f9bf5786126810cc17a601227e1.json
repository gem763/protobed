The Wankel was a mainstay of the brand for decades before being discontinued in 2012 due to issues with fuel economy and emissions and is not currently offered by any automaker.\n\nThe post features an image of the first car Mazda ever built with a rotary engine, the 1967 Cosmo, sitting in front of a cutaway of an engine. According to Autocar, the accompanying text says \u201crotor engines make the world more beautiful,\u201d and it adds that there is a countdown to something happening on Sept. 26.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLast year Mazda confirmed plans to use a new rotary engine as a range-extender for a plug-in hybrid model. So if you put the two pieces of this puzzle together, we\u2019re likely to see one of those revealed alongside the pure electric vehicle in Tokyo, if not sooner than that.\n\nIn this type of application, the engine doesn't propel the vehicle directly, but simply works as a generator to provide electricity for an electric motor when the battery runs low. Proponents of this design say the smooth-running nature of the rotary is better suited for it than the piston engines used in cars like the Chevrolet Volt.\n\nBE HEARD!
