He\u2019s done everything he can to stir up racial conflict and hatred in this country.\"\n\nBeto O'Rourke told MSNBC Trump made it \"very clear\" that he's a white supremacist.\n\nBernie Sanders told CNN's Jake Tapper over the weekend that he believes Trump is a white supremacist.\n\nThe big picture: 2020 Democrats have been driving the national conversation in the wake of last weekend's twin mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, calling for more gun restrictions and directing much of their criticism at Trump.\n\nO'Rourke has been one of the most vocal anti-Trump figures since El Paso's massacre Saturday. The former Texas congressman has said previously that Trump is a \"white nationalist\" who encourages racism and violence in the U.S.\n\nWhat he's saying: Trump denies he's racist. He told reporters Wednesday he's \"concerned about the rise of any group of hate.\" \"Whether it's white supremacy, whether it's any other kind of supremacy. Whether it's Antifa,\" he said, referring to the far-left, anti-fascist movement. \"Whether it's any group of hate.\"\n\nTrump later tweeted: \"The Dems new weapon is actually their old weapon, one which they never cease to use when they are down, or run out of facts, RACISM! They are truly disgusting! They even used it on Nancy Pelosi. I will be putting out a list of all people who have been so (ridiculously) accused!\"\n\nWhat\u2019s next: This will put pressure on other Democrats to agree with a charge not made in a generation of American politics: that their opponent, the sitting president, believes whites are the dominant race and should control other races.\n\nWhile former Vice President Joe Biden has not called Trump a white supremacist, he did say earlier Wednesday that the president \"has fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation.\"\n\nEditor's note: This article has been updated with new details throughout.\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "\"He\u2019s done everything he can to stir up racial conflict and hatred in this country.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/56qOMIsHM9skJGNFqLQ2Du18LlM=/0x230:3999x2479/1920x1080/2019/08/08/1565244638470.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-08"}
