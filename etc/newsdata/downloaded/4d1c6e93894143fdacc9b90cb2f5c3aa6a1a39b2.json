There are so many British fans here and I know lots of Brits live in Doha, but lots have travelled and for my mum to be here, my dad, John [Blackie, coach] and his wife, and my physios\u2026 it means so much.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different thing with everyone saying you\u2019re the favourite, but it\u2019s a different thing going and doing it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Katarina Johnson-Thompson holds a 96-point overnight lead in the heptathlon.\n\nThe 26-year-old sits ahead of Olympic and defending champion Nafi Thiam.\n\nJohnson-Thompson set personal bests in the 100m hurdles and shot put to cap an impressive day and is allowing herself to dream of gold.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019m aiming to do, it\u2019s something that I\u2019m in shape to do, and I\u2019m in a very good position to do it.\n\n\u201cBut you never know with these things on day two.
