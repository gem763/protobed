The patient's ring and little finger were broken and his index finger had been ripped out of its socket during the blast\n\nHe was discharged but returned four weeks later to have the surgical wires removed.\n\nHowever, medics from St Mary\u2019s Hospital and the University of Oxford revealed the patient did not attend a number of his hand therapy appointments, which compromised his rehab.\n\nAs a result, after three months he was still struggling with stiffness in his hand.\n\nFirework-related hospital admissions have doubled in the last 10 years and are increasing in severity.\n\nIn England last year, 4,436 people were rushed to A&E due to firework-related injuries - a figure that has more than doubled from 2,141 in 2009 and 2010.\n\nThe number of these injuries soars over October and November during Halloween and Guy Fawkes night.\n\nThis worrying increase in injuries has led to the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons to begin lobbying the Government for changes to legislation.\n\nThey are calling for mandatory graphic warning images on firework packaging showing the potential injuries caused by misuse.", "description": "WARNING, GRAPHIC CONTENT: The 30-year-old, who is thought to be British, had to have his right hand sewn back together and was left with four fingers following the horrendous accident.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/12/20128708-0-image-a-47_1571916434184.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
