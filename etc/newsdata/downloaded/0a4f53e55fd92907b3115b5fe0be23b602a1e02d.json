What should really concern them, however, is an emerging picture of a company culture of cutting too many corners.\n\nOn Wednesday, Boeing reported adjusted earnings of $1.45 a share for the third quarter, 30% below analysts\u2019 average estimate. This comes one day after the Chicago-based plane maker announced the replacement of commercial-jet business head Kevin McAllister, the first high-profile ouster since regulators grounded the MAX in March.\n\nYet Boeing\u2019s shares rose more than 2% in premarket trading\u2014after falling 12% over the past month\u2014because the company said its assumption is still for the MAX to be recertified in 2019.\n\nInvestors are also enticed by Boeing keeping quarterly dividends untouched at $1.2 billion. This is despite free cash flow\u2014a measure of how much surplus money the company generates\u2014coming in much worse than expected at a negative $2.9 billion, as 42 MAX jets are still built every month without being delivered. Boeing has issued debt to replenish cash buffers. At the end of the third quarter, total debt was 70% higher than at the end of the first.\n\nBut investors should focus less on this quarter\u2019s number crunching\u2014after all, all those parked planes will eventually be sold\u2014and more on scrutinizing whether the company has truly learned from this debacle.\n\nOver the past week, government investigators revealed worrisome findings about the MAX\u2019s development, which include a pilot raising concerns about it three years ago, as well as internal surveys taken during the same period showing that employees felt \u201cpotential undue pressure\u201d about safety-related approvals.\n\nAs a result, analysts have turned sour on Boeing, with only 48% of them giving its shares a \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation\u2014the lowest since late 2017, according to data provider FactSet.\n\nTo be sure, they could be overreacting. But consider: Recent revelations create political pressure to push out the MAX\u2019s recertification process\u2014particularly in Europe, where regulators have already said that they won\u2019t give the green light until at least January. Boeing has warned that further delays could lead to production shutdowns.\n\nAnd there are even bigger concerns, such as the possibility that Mr. McAllister, who wasn\u2019t at Boeing when the MAX was developed, is being used as a scapegoat to avoid deeper changes. His ousting does appear to have some specific reasons\u2014his role did include overseeing the fix for the MAX as well as the new 777X, which is now delayed\u2014but few of Boeing\u2019s fundamental issues can be blamed on him.\n\nThe MAX debacle has cast a spotlight on the company\u2019s excessive emphasis on cost control and hitting short-term financial targets, which many also blame for the quality-control issues during the production of the 787 Dreamliner.\n\nResponsibility for this must go all the way up to Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg, who has resisted pressure to resign. While he was recently stripped of his role as chairman, his replacement David Calhoun was also part of the MAX\u2019s development.\n\nThe company has unveiled some changes that include more supervisory powers for engineers, but this is far from swinging back the pendulum from the bean counters in Chicago to the engineers in Seattle.\n\nWhile Boeing\u2019s plane catalog has proven to be a winner and likely ensures long-term success, convincing investors that the company\u2019s culture can change is now necessary to win back trust.\n\nTwo crashes and the global grounding of Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX commercial airliner led to extensive disruption in the international aerospace industry.
