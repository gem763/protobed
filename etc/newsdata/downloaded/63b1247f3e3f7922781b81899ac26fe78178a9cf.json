He hasn't put a foot wrong.'\n\nWorld No 30 Kyrgios, a devastating player when motivated and injury-free, joins Alex de Minaur, John Millman, Jordan Thompson and doubles specialist John Peers on the Australia team for his first Davis Cup appearance in nearly two years.\n\nHewitt described Kyrgios as a 'different character' but also praised the 24-year-old\n\nAustralia have been pooled with Belgium and Colombia in Group D for the 18-nation finals in Madrid from Nov. 18-24.\n\nHewitt said he and Kyrgios had mended fences in March at Indian Wells and were in regular contact.\n\n'I got a message (from him) saying \"mate, I want to get back in the team\",' added the 38-year-old.\n\n'The great thing is, he has a great relationship with all the players as well.\n\n'It's kind of about him wanting to be a part of the team and do the right things day in day out.\n\n'For me, I'd much rather have him on my team.'", "description": "Wayward tennis talent Nick Kyrgios may be a 'different character' but Australia's Davis Cup team is better with him in it, according to captain Lleyton Hewitt.", "authors": ["Ian Ransom"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/08/20024374-0-image-a-11_1571729136020.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
