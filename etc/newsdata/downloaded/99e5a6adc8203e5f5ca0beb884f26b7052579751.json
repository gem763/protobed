Kobe, by contrast, was in the midst of trying to four-peat with the Lakers and ascending to full-blown superstardom at age 24.\n\nSuffice it to say Jordan's slight motivated the Lakers star.\n\nAccording to Arenas' telling of what transpired afterward, Bryant didn't speak to Lakers teammates for two weeks. The situation became so bleak that Lakers teammates went to Phil Jackson and asked if Bryant was upset with them. Jackson then told them the story, setting the stage for Bryant to exact his revenge.\n\nKobe did just that, dropping 42 first-half points on his way to a 55-point outing the next time he went head-to-head against Jordan that spring. Jordan finished with 23 points in the Lakers' 108-94 blowout victory.\n\nOf course, all of this is second-hand information. Arenas was playing for the Golden State Warriors at the time, so it's not as if he was within earshot of the situation.\n\nThat said, we all very much want to believe this is true on both ends here, so we're choosing to take it all at face value.", "description": "You don't have to  look hard  to find the Michael Jordan inspiration in  Kobe Bryant 's game.
