Photo: Cond\u00e9 Nast\n\nKeke Palmer is well aware that anyone even moderately online can\u2019t say \u201csorry\u201d anymore without adding \u201cto this man.\u201d The excerpt from Vanity Fair\u2019s lie detector test video with Palmer \u2014 in which she is ruefully unable to identify a photo of Dick Cheney \u2014 has been meme\u2019d and shared and the actress has talked about it with Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live as Twitter turns into the anthem for the back half of 2019. And Palmer knows its an anthem we the people need, so she\u2019s just released official merch for it, because what else would a hustler do? You can now buy a \u201cSorry To This Man\u201d t-shirt off of Palmer\u2019s site, and yes it does come with a still frame of her face right after she banished the specter of Cheney like a ghost she robbed of its power by refusing to believe in it.\n\nthis for all y\u2019all sorry asses.
