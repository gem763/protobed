It will be a hard task, given parliamentary arithmetic and the demands from each political party that could vote in favour. It remains to be seen if Orban is capable of gathering the level of support required.\n\nOrban, who was born in the Romanian city of Brasov, has been involved in politics for close to thirty years. He worked in local administration in Bucharest, the Romanian capital, during the 1990s and later served for almost two years as transport minister. He was a member of parliament from 2008 to 2016 and became his party\u2019s official leader in June 2017. This followed a heavy defeat in domestic parliamentary elections in December 2016.\n\nRadu Magdin, a Romanian political analyst, describes Orban as one of the last, if not the last, \u201cliberal Mohicans\u201d.\n\nRead more: Opposition leader Ludovic Orban invited to be Romania\u2019s new prime minister\n\n\u201cHe is a party faithful since the 90s, standing with the liberals in both good and bad times,\u201d he told Euronews.\n\nIn a speech after accepting the nomination, Orban said his government\u2019s main priorities would be restoring macroeconomic balance and correcting the economic measures that have damaged the business environment in Romania while reducing the number of ministries and bringing back government competence.\n\n\u201cWe also aim to follow all the principles of the rule of law, ensure real independence for the justice system, and bring institutions back to serving citizens,\u201d he said, directing criticism at the outgoing PSD-led government.\n\nMagdin predicts that we will see a switch by Orban from a typical opposition tone to a wiser, stabilisation mode, as he tries to set up his government and alter some of the controversial pieces of legislation that the former government passed.\n\n\u201cHe is likely to focus on the economy and the budget and try to secure additional revenue while not falling for the austerity trap in an electoral year,\u201d Magdin adds, pointing to parliamentary elections that will take place in Romania in 2020.\n\nOrban has had his controversial moments in the past, involving strong criticism of other senior Romanian political figures and traffic incidents.\n\nHowever, under his watch, the National Liberals have seen a small uptick in their fortunes. The party saw its support grow during the European Parliamentary elections in May, though this was more about the failings of the governing Social Democrats than strong messaging from the PNL.", "description": "A profile of the man who could soon lead a new government in Romania.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/75/38/1000x563_cmsv2_83a3d18f-2daa-5866-a3f0-47fab38c2fc0-4237538.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
