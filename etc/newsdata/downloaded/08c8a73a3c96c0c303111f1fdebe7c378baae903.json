But changing your plans to include two shorter but tough sessions in a weekend is a great way to replicate that tired leg feeling.\n\nI headed out for two 21km runs over the notoriously tough Twins as I wind up to my first 100km race, the Vibram Hong Kong 100, in January.\n\nI spoke to two runners \u2013 two time Hardrock 100 finisher Andre Blumberg, and Irish national runner Brian McFlynn \u2013 to find out why I was putting myself through this torture.\n\n\ufeffWatch: Back-to-back training for the HK100\n\n\ufeffPracticalities\n\nBlumberg said that back-to-back sessions are sometimes just easier to fit in your schedule. Not everyone can head out on to the trails at the weekend for 10 hours. But, by splitting it up, you still practise on tired legs as you head out for day two, but you have time for your pesky obligations and family.\n\n\ufeffInjuries\n\nMcFlynn said that running back-to-back sessions lets him fit volume into his programme but has far less risk of injury than slogging it out on the trails in one long go.\n\n\ufeffMental training\n\nGetting motivated for the second day can be harder than just pushing through a long run. This is great for training mental fortitude that you\u2019ll need during the race. Blumberg said you can make it more mentally challenging by doing the first of your two sessions straight after work on a Friday, when you are already mentally spent from the office.\n\n\ufeffDon\u2019t take it lightly\n\nJust because you are splitting up your sessions, doesn\u2019t mean you should underestimate them. They are still tough, especially in hot or humid weather. \u201cI have quit on back-to-back runs before because I haven\u2019t taken into account the weather,\u201d McFlynn said.\n\n\ufeffStill go on long runs\n\n\u201cThey both have a time and place,\u201d said Blumberg. There are some things you just cannot replicate on shorter runs, like nutrition or if your gear fits properly.\n\n\ufeffEnjoy it and reward yourself\n\n\u201cEnjoy the runs as much as possible, inevitably the distance will come into play and will result in a good effort,\u201d McFlynn said. He added you should reward yourself with a big meal at the conclusion of your training. \u201cBut save the post-run beer until after the second day.\u201d", "description": "Having two tough sessions in a weekend, instead of one big run, is great preparation for an ultramarathon", "authors": ["Mark Agnew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/16/88ebeb42-ef2d-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_image_hires_103234.JPG?itok=WyvKciiL&v=1571193159", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
