When asked how she would vote if the public were asked directly again, she said: \u201cI would vote to remain.\u201d\n\nAll opposition parties support a second referendum. When pressed to clarify why she was serving in Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet if this was her view, she said: \u201cIt is not a result I was comfortable with but I have accepted it.\u201d\n\nShe later told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI feel very firmly that the result of the 2016 referendum needs to be fulfilled and that\u2019s why I\u2019m in the cabinet and that\u2019s why I support Boris Johnson\u2019s determination to make sure that we do leave the EU by 31 October, preferably with a deal.\n\n\u201cMy instincts are that I was sorry that the remain campaign didn\u2019t win in 2016 and that really I\u2019m sorry that we\u2019ve seen all the division and uncertainty over the last three-and-a-half years.\u201d\n\nShe said her views on the matter had evolved because she could now \u201csee a way for the UK to leave the EU and to do it with a deal and to strike out in different ways in the rest of the world\u201d.\n\nIn an interview with the Times, David Cameron accused Johnson and Michael Gove of effectively \u201ctrashing\u201d the government during the 2016 campaign and said a second poll could not be ruled out \u201cbecause we\u2019re stuck\u201d.\n\nResponding to the former prime minister\u2019s comments, Morgan told ITV: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually very helpful to keep rerunning the 2016 campaign and who said what, when. The fact is, we had a result and actually it\u2019s incumbent on those of us who are in government, still MPs, to make sure that result is delivered.\u201d\n\nMorgan said she had been very clear that she would vote to remain but did not support a second referendum.\n\nIn response to Morgan\u2019s comments, the Labour MP David Lammy tweeted:\n\nDavid Lammy (@DavidLammy) Repeat after me. Nicky Morgan put her own career progression before her conscience, constituents and country. pic.twitter.com/5J76bv2oE0\n\nThe former Brexit secretary David Davis also suggested on Saturday that the government might have a legal strategy to avoid extending Britain\u2019s EU membership beyond 31 October, despite the so-called Benn Act to avoid no deal.\n\nThe legislation, which received royal assent earlier this week, would require the prime minister to seek an extension unless a deal is approved or parliament agrees to leave the EU without a deal by 19 October.\n\nDavis told BBC Radio 4\u2019s The Week In Westminster: \u201cI think there may well be a legal strategy \u2013 I\u2019ve no idea what it is \u2013 but I think that may well be the way through, to effectively legally kill off the Benn bill [sic] and then find a way of coming back to the negotiations with a real sword of Damocles over them, the Europeans, rather than over us.\u201d\n\nJohnson has repeatedly said he would take Britain out of the EU at the end of next month, and that he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than ask for an extension.", "description": "Culture secretary says result of 2016 poll should be respected", "authors": ["Jedidajah Otte"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78148f9b6c9c506eb076bdd96af03f5abdc6afde/0_37_2364_1418/master/2364.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=30c0879e2407956dde249b818dcf5b80", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
