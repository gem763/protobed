Federal immigration officials tell The Dallas Morning News that it's unclear where he can be found.\n\nPolice say Ramirez-Cayente admitted to shooting the 35-year-old transgender woman, who had six gunshot wounds. He was charged with aggravated assault and released from the Dallas County jail.\n\nIt's unclear if Dallas officials were aware of his immigration status when he was released on bond after the shooting.\n\nRamirez-Cayente was apprehended near the border in 2010 after entering the U.S. illegally.
