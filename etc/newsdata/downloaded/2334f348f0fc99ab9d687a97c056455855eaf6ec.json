Right now there has never been a more urgent need for you to educate yourselves on the CEE (Climate and Ecological Emergency) and to use your voices to reach new audiences with the truth.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey added in their call to arms, which was posted on Extinction Rebellion\u2019s website this week, they cannot simply ignore the work and activism of young people such as Greta Thunberg to \u2018fight for their already devastated future\u2019. And they\u2019re prepared to put themselves \u2018in your firing line\u2019 to make sure the important messages are heard.\n\nThe celebrities' letter in full Dear journalists who have called us hypocrites, You\u2019re right. We live high carbon lives and the industries that we are part of have huge carbon footprints. Like you \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 we are stuck in this fossil-fuel economy and without systemic change, our lifestyles will keep on causing climate and ecological harm. There is, however, a more urgent story that our profiles and platforms can draw attention to. Life on earth is dying. We are living in the midst of the 6th mass extinction. For those who still doubt the severity of our situation, here is the International Monetary Fund on 10th October 2019 : \u201cGlobal warming causes major damage to the global economy and the natural world and engenders risks of catastrophic and irreversible outcomes\u201d And here is Sir David Attenborough on 3rd December 2018 : \u201cRight now, we are facing a man-made disaster of global scale. Our greatest threat in thousands of years. Climate change. If we don\u2019t take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.\u201d Climate change is happening faster and more furiously than was predicted; millions of people are suffering, leaving their homes and arriving on our borders as refugees. Alongside these people who are already paying the price for our fossil fuelled economy, there are millions of children \u2013 called to action by Greta Thunberg \u2013 who are begging us, the people with power and influence, to stand up and fight for their already devastated future. We cannot ignore their call. Even if by answering them we put ourselves in your firing line. The stories that you write calling us climate hypocrites will not silence us. The media exists to tell the public the truth. Right now there has never been a more urgent need for you to educate yourselves on the CEE (Climate and Ecological Emergency) and to use your voices to reach new audiences with the truth. We invite all people with platforms and profiles to join us and move beyond fear, to use your voices fearlessly to amplify the real story. Thousands of ordinary people are risking their freedom by taking part in non-violent civil disobedience. We\u2019ve been inspired by their courage to speak out and join them. We beg you to do the same.\u2019\n\nStars have come under fire in the past for their carbon footprint while campaigning for climate action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month Dame Emma Thompson admitted it was hypocritical to fly to a climate change protest, but insists she flies a lot less than she used to.\n\nThe 60-year-old was criticised earlier this year when it emerged she flew 5,400 miles to attend the Extinction Rebellion protest in Central London.\n\nEmma admitted she was flying a lot less, after being called out (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nA flight from Los Angeles International Airport to London Heathrow generates around 1.67 tonnes of CO2. Later Emma said that while it may have been hypocritical of her to fly to the protest that is \u2018not the story\u2019.\n\nSpeaking to ITV News, the Love Actually star said: \u2018What does it matter that I get pilloried. If you put your head up, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. But I think what really does matter is to point out that that\u2019s not the story.\n\n\u2018I was really shocked by that actually, because all these people know I have to fly when I work. I live here, I\u2019ve always lived here and sometimes I have to fly. I fly so much less than I did but I do have to fly sometimes.\u2019\n\nThe Oscar winner continued: \u2018The message from Extinction Rebellion wasn\u2019t that no one can fly, it was that for decades now we have been asking for clean energy and this has been ignored.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I may well be hypocritical by flying but I\u2019m conscious of flying so I fly much less, but sometimes I have to when I\u2019m working. But I\u2019ll continue to find ways to get to places without flying.\u2019\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio was also one called out for his private jet use, deciding to start flying commercial earlier this year (probably still up the pointy end of the plane, but changes are afoot at least), despite his millions raised in the fight against climate change.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
