He received a standing ovation and took a curtain call after the team announced the batting title on the scoreboard in the sixth.\n\nDJ LeMahieu of the Yankees was second at .327 after an 0 for 3 finish.\n\nAnderson joined Luke Appling (1936 and 1943) and Frank Thomas (1997) as batting champions for the White Sox. The 26-year-old Anderson hit .240 in 567 at-bats last season.\n\n\u201cHe will continue to improve in all aspects of his game,\u201d Chicago manager Rick Renteria said. \u201cHe will continue to be a guy that helps ignite us. If he\u2019s not a star now, he\u2019s a star in the making.\u201d\n\nChicago went 72-89, up from 62-100 last year.\n\nDetroit skidded to a 47-114 mark from last year\u2019s 64-98 and wound up with the second-most losses in franchise history behind 119 in 2003.

Yo\u00e1n Moncada hit an RBI groundout, Eloy Jim\u00e9nez followed with a run-scoring double against Spencer Turnbull (3-17) and Welington Castillo hit a two-run homer off David McKay.\n\nTurnbull was 0-13 in his last 18 starts after beating Atlanta on May 31. Turnbull allowed four runs and three hits in 5 1/3 innings.\n\nJimmy Cordero (1-1) got two outs for his second big league win, his first since Aug. 21 last year for Washington against Philadelphia. Kelvin Herrera pitched the ninth for his first save since Aug. 5 last year for the Nationals against Cincinnati.\n\nMiguel Cabrera and Ronny Rodr\u00edguez homered for Detroit. Cabrera hit 12 homers, raising his two-year total to 15 and his career total to 477.\n\nSEATS\n\nChicago drew 1,649,775 at home, up from 40,958 from a year ago.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nTigers: 2B Harold Castro missed his second straight game with a sore ankle.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tim Anderson became the third Chicago White Sox player to win an American League batting title, finishing at .335 after going 0 for 2 in a season-ending 5-3 win over the worst-in-the-majors Detroit Tigers on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Jackson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/tigers_white_sox_baseball_54086_c0-123-3000-1872_s1770x1032.jpg?638d87d471198716a92bdd753afc4a2ee0294bf9", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
