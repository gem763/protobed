That was the biggest dollar and percentage gain since July 10, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The move followed Tuesday\u2019s 2.1% decline, which led to the lowest front-month contract finish since Aug. 26.\n\nThe global benchmark, November Brent crude UK:BRNX19 , rose $2.44, or 4.2%, to $60.70 a barrel, following losses in each of the previous three sessions on ICE Futures Europe.\n\nU.S. petroleum inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Energy Information Administration will be each delayed by a day to Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, because of the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Monday, when most major U.S. markets were closed.\n\nThe EIA is expected to report a decline of 3 million barrels in domestic crude supplies for the week ended Aug. 30, according to a survey conducted by S&P Global Platts. That would mark a third straight weekly decline for crude stockpiles.\n\nHope of weakening U.S. supplies and some upbeat developments in Asia helped underpin buying in risky assets. Equity markets in Hong Kong HSI, -0.19% jumped by the most in a day since November after the city\u2019s Chief Executive Carrie Lam said she would formally withdraw the extradition bill that sparked monthslong demonstrations that have hurt the territory\u2019s economy.\n\nStill, some crude investors remain worried that the global outlook remains dim, marked by unresolved trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and signs of weakening economic growth, including in the U.S. \u2014 factors that could eventually erode oil demand.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index fell to 49.1% in August \u2014 the reading was the lowest since January 2016 and indicated a contraction in activity. That report was released after the U.S. and China both raised tariffs on goods imported from the other, including a 5% levy on U.S. oil to China.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing trade war between the world\u2019s largest economies has hurt China perhaps more than the U.S. but a few signs of a slowdown have now emerged in the U.S. too \u2014 not least the ISM\u2019s manufacturing purchasing managers index, a key factory gauge, which unexpectedly contracted for the first time since 2016,\u201d wrote Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, in a Wednesday research report.\n\nBack on Nymex, October gasoline US:RBV19 tacked on 6.2 cents, or 4.2%, to $1.5329 a gallon, while October heating oil US:HOV19 added 7.7 cents, or 4.3%, to $1.8802 a gallon.\n\nThe EIA report on Thursday is expected to show supply declines of 1.9 million barrels for gasoline and 120,000 barrels for distillates, which include heating oil, according to the S&P Global Platts analyst survey.\n\nOctober natural gas US:NGV19 settled at $2.445 per million British thermal units, up 8.7 cents, or 3.7%. The EIA on Thursday is expected to report a 75 billion-cubic-foot weekly increase in domestic natural-gas supply, according to a separate S&P Global Platts survey.", "description": "Oil futures climb Wednesday, tracking a global rally in assets perceived as risky, as investors focused on a geopolitical optimism and a forecast for...", "authors": ["Myra P.
