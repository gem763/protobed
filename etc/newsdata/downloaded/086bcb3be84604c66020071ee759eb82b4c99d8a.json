It emphasizes the association\u2019s \u201ccontinuing efforts to support college athletes,\u201d while conspicuously omitting any reference to the persuasive pressures that have been applied by California, Congress and the courts.\n\nIt is, of course, a crock.

(Photo: Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports)\n\n\"There\u2019s no question the legislative efforts in Congress and various states has been a catalyst to change,\" NCAA President Mark Emmert acknowledged Tuesday in Atlanta. \"It\u2019s clear that schools and the presidents are listening and have heard loud and clear that everyone agrees this is an area that needs to be addressed.\"\n\nMore: If college athletes could profit off their marketability, how much would they be worth? In some cases, millions\n\nIt\u2019s clear, too, that NCAA actions concerning athlete welfare are invariably reactions. The organization overseeing college sports in this country gives ground grudgingly, typically when outflanked, while clinging to the archaic concept of amateurism as a means to preserve its cash flow and control. In an era of skyrocketing coaching salaries, bloated staffing levels and static scholarship limits, the NCAA\u2019s concern for the plight of student athletes appears to be more often stated than sincere.\n\nWhen NCAA board chairman Michael V. Drake, president of Ohio State, says, \u201cWe must embrace change to provide the best possible experience for college athletes,\u201d the appropriate response is either a giggle or a guffaw.\n\nThe NCAA embraces change as if it were a cactus. Even now, as federal and state governments prod the organization toward meaningful reforms, foot-dragging continues to frustrate measures that properly belong on the fast track. Tuesday\u2019s unanimous vote to allow athletes\u2019 NIL rights was conditioned on those rights being exercised \u201cin a manner consistent with the collegiate model.\u201d\n\nWhatever that means.\n\nTo former Duke basketball star Jay Bilas, an attorney and ESPN analyst, what that most likely means is, \u201cWe\u2019re not allowing ANYTHING.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Collegiate model\u2019 is another made-up term with no meaning,\u201d Bilas tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s just, \u2018Everything is pro, only the players are restricted.\u2019\u201d\n\nFurthermore, any forthcoming rules governing NIL transactions are expected to \u201cfacilitate fair and balanced competition,\u201d prevent compensation for performance or participation and \u201cprohibit inducements to select, remain at, or transfer to a specific institution.\u201d\n\nIn short, the NCAA is ceding control only slightly, while establishing parameters and a process for bylaw revision sure to spawn more subcommittees and additional delay. Though any organization with 1,115 member institutions and three distinct divisions is bound to be a bit unwieldy, the NCAA has a knack for turning fundamental questions into filibusters.\n\nHappily, however, stall tactics are of limited utility against motivated adversaries with superior power. While the NCAA operates at a significant advantage against aggrieved students with finite eligibility, it will have a harder time running out the clock on California or on the federal government, should any of the pending NIL bills pass.\n\nShould it fail to move fast or far enough, the NCAA would risk losing some of its self-governing authority to politicians. Given the billions its member schools generate through sports, and that NIL payments would presumably come from third parties and not university funds, this would be a bad time to misread the room.\n\nIn its \u201ccontinuing efforts to support college athletes,\u201d the NCAA can be counted on to consider what works best for the NCAA.
