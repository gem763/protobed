These days, the highest-quality smart TVs compete on 4K displays, HDR, and ultra-HD \u2014 and all of these are features of this Samsung 55-inch Frame TV. The acronym that\u2019s most important here is QLED, or quantum dot LED. That\u2019s the technology Samsung has pioneered to ensure high-quality depth of color from every image that appears on this screen, from super-black blacks to bright whites and literally billions of shades of color in between.\n\nThat rich color is especially important on the Frame TV, which has a picture-frame-like border (hence the name), can be mounted to the wall like a painting, and transforms into a still work of art when not being used as a TV. So the QLED display means you\u2019ll be watching the new Avengers movie or Bachelor in Paradise in glorious 4K, but no one will even know that there\u2019s a TV hidden in that lovely framed painting on your wall. And right now, this trompe l\u2019oeil 55-inch TV from Samsung is as cheap as it\u2019s ever been: just $1,398, or $400 off the list price.\n\nSamsung Frame 55-Inch QLED 4K LS03 Series Ultra HD Smart TV $1,398 (was $1,798, now 22% off) $1,398 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
