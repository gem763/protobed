The talent is there and when they are talented, they will play, but at the same time, we have to compete every single day to fight with the best teams in England and Europe.\n\n\u201cFor that we need David Silvas and Kevin De Bruynes and Sergio Agueros and Fernandinhos and all these type of players.\n\n\u201cThe young players can be help for the other ones but if the basis is young, it is not possible.\u201d\n\nFoden\u2019s lack of first-team action means he is yet to break into England manager Gareth Southgate\u2019s plans for selection at senior international level.\n\nThere have been calls for Foden to follow the example of Jadon Sancho \u2014 whose career has taken off spectacularly since leaving City\u2019s academy to join Borussia Dortmund in 2017.\n\nChelsea trio Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori were also included in Southgate\u2019s latest England squad on Thursday after loan spells in the Championship last season.\n\nBut Guardiola remains adamant that City remains the best place for Foden right now.\n\n\u201cWhen Phil is here in the first team of Man City it is because he is ready to play every single game and it is because he has everything to play,\u201d added Guardiola.\n\n\u201cI said many times, everyone in this room knows exactly what my opinion of Phil Foden is.\n\n\u201cHe is 18 or 19 years old, so he plays quite enough minutes and he will play a lot this season and the next seasons.\u201d\n\nFoden\u2019s time to shine in the league could come on Sunday when City host Wolves with De Bruyne sidelined due to a groin strain.", "description": "Manchester (United Kingdom) (AFP) \u2013 Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola believes the pressure on the Premier League champions to win trophies", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/2da67e_phil-foden-has-struggled-minutes-in-manchester-city-team-season-pressure-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
