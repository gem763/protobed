Then you can pretend you\u2019re Jackson Pollock while adding abstract designs in coloured chocolate.\n\nMakes: 20-24\n\nPrep time: 10 mins\n\nBake time: 4-7 mins per batch (7-12 batches in total)\n\nPlus shaping and decorating time\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 large egg whites (about 100g)\n\n80g caster sugar\n\n\u00bc tsp almond extract\n\n55ml vegetable oil\n\n2 tbsp water\n\n80g plain flour\n\n200g white chocolate (or use candy melts/compound chocolate)\n\nCocoa-butter- or oil-based food dyes (not water-based, or the chocolate will sieze)\n\nPlus:\n\nPaper to write your fortunes on\n\nHeat the oven to 180C/160C fan/350F/gas mark 4. Line a baking tray with baking paper or a silicone mat (preferable). Write 24 fortunes on slips of paper.\n\nPut the egg whites and sugar in a mixing bowl and whisk until frothy. Add the almond extract, oil and water, and whisk again until just combined. Sieve in the flour, and whisk a final time to combine into a smooth paste.\n\nPut 1-1\u00bd teaspoons of the mixture on the prepared baking tray and use the back of the spoon to spread the mixture into a thin 8-9cm circle. Repeat to create two to three circles (it\u2019s best to bake a small amount at a time because you will need to shape the cookies while they\u2019re hot), then bake for between four and seven minutes. Keep a close eye on the batter and take it out of the oven when the edges have just turned brown (a few seconds can make a big difference).\n\nOnce baked, use a spatula or knife to peel a disc off the paper/silicone mat, then flip it over. Carefully fold it in half over a fortune paper, then use the edge of a mug to guide you as you pull the corners down to form the classic fortune cookie shape. Place in a muffin tin or similar, to help it hold its shape while cooling. Repeat until you have used up all the batter.\n\nMelt your white chocolate (or candy melts) in 10-15-second bursts in the microwave, stirring well in between, then divide it and colour it with the food dyes. Decorate the fortune cookies by dipping into different colours. Once set, add further details by either painting on chocolate with a brush or using a brush to randomly splatter the chocolate.
