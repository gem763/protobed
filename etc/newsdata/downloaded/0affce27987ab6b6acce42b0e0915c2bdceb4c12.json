The rice isn\u2019t perfectly fluffy; instead, leftover rice simmers until it breaks down from kernel to stew. (You can, of course, use raw rice, too: Cook it in Step 2 for about an hour, partly covered and stirring occasionally.) You'll want to cook the scallions and ginger until nearly burned, and top the whole thing with a fried egg (or make it soft-boiled). Take note that most kimchi gets its funk from shrimp, anchovies and-or fish sauce, so if you\u2019d like to make this dish vegetarian, make sure to use a vegetarian kimchi.", "description": "A combination of pungent chopped kimchi, toasted scallions and ginger, and rice that's been bolstered with a hit of kimchi brine, this porridge is fiery and sinus-clearing The rice isn\u2019t perfectly fluffy; instead, leftover rice simmers until it breaks down from kernel to stew (You can, of course, use raw rice, too: Cook it in Step 2 for about an hour, partly covered and stirring occasionally.)
