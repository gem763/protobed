But when it comes to home buying, just because you can doesn't mean you should. In some cases, renting a house may be the more financially responsible decision.\n\nThinking about taking the leap into home ownership? Here are nine scenarios where it may not be wise to buy a home.\n\nYou don't have savings\n\nMaybe you have the cash you need for a down payment and your monthly house payment, but owning a home is a much larger investment than just those two amounts.\n\nLoan officer and financial consultant Amber Hutton recommends that anyone thinking about purchasing a home have three to six months of financial reserves saved up for basic budgetary needs.\n\n\"If the individual can't demonstrate a lifestyle of financial wellness that yields this protection, they are demonstrating they likely do not have the financial responsibility to be responsible for an asset/liability worth $100,000-plus,\" she says.\n\nYou won't live in the home long-term\n\nBefore you purchase a house, think about how long you will live there. Do you plan to live in a city for just a couple of years? Will your housing needs change within that time frame? If so, renting may be the better option, says Gary Malin, president of the New York-based real estate brokerage Citi Habitats.\n\n\"Buying a home comes with a variety of closing costs, and a five-year timeframe gives the new homeowner sufficient time to recoup these expenses,\" he says. \"As the home appreciates in value, you'll gain equity in it.\"\n\nKeep in mind that moving out too soon could also result in tax penalties depending on where you live. If you haven't lived in the home for two years, you may have to pay capital gains taxes on your profit on the house if you sell it.\n\nYou can't put 20% down on the home\n\nRenting may seem like throwing money away, but it could also save you from losing money every month on private mortgage insurance (PMI), says Brendan Willmann, a certified financial planner with Granada Wealth Management.\n\nCan you afford your dream home? Use this calculator to find out:\n\nSure, it may be possible to purchase a home with a lower down payment. But if you can't put down at least 20%, you'll likely have to pay a pesky PMI until you have 20% equity in the home.\n\nSince PMI can cost up to 1% of your total loan amount annually, you may have to dish out a few hundred dollars a month.\n\nYou just moved to a new city\n\nJust moved to a new place? If you're planning to stay there long-term, purchasing may seem like a smart idea \u2014 unless you decide you don't like the area you purchased in.\n\nWillmann recommends renting in a new city until you get a better feel for neighborhoods and school districts in the area (if you have kids or plan to).\n\nYou have student loan or credit card debt\n\nBuying a home is often billed as \"good debt,\" since you gain equity in the house over time. But before you can reap the benefits of that investment, take care of your higher-interest obligations.\n\n\"If you have a high amount of student loans or credit card debt, you're better off paying those down than spending money on a down payment to buy a home,\" says Andrew Helling, a Nebraska-licensed real estate agent and the owner of REthority.com.\n\nIf your student loans, car payments, and credit cards have higher interest than your mortgage, you'll likely pay more money over time if you don't prioritize them \u2014 especially if you can only pay the minimum on your loans due to your house payment.\n\nYou might change careers\n\nUnless you want to deal with potential tax penalties, investing in a home locks you down in one place \u2014 which means you may not be able to take advantage of job opportunities in other locations.\n\n\"Renting can be a better option for anyone who doesn't have a stable job, changes jobs often, or [is] considering a career move,\" says Jeff Rose, a certified financial planner. \"You may not know where your next job will be located and whether or not your income would support a house payment.\"\n\nYou live with a significant other\n\nIf you're in a committed relationship, consider its stability and strength before diving into a huge investment like buying a home.\n\nAre you in a new relationship or a relationship that may not continue? If so, real estate agent Ben Ross recommends avoiding the long-term commitment of buying a home together.\n\n\"If your relationship with your partner is rocky and turbulent, I would suggest renting until the waters calm or the relationship is over,\" he says.\n\nYou'd rather have a landlord\n\nOwning a home is a big responsibility. From repairs and renovations to yard maintenance and shoveling, you'll have more expenses \u2014 and chores \u2014 with your new home.\n\nIf you'd rather have these things taken care of for you, then certified financial planner Dave Lowell, founder of Up Your Money Game, says you're better off living somewhere with a landlord.\n\nIt's a seller's market\n\nThere may also be times when it's generally just not great for buyers to buy. Before you start looking for houses, talk to a realtor about the state of the market.\n\n\"If you're in a hot sellers' market with inflated home prices, it may be better to rent and wait until the housing market flips in your favor, says financial advisor Matthew Kircher, MBA. \"The last thing you want to do is purchase a home for too much money and be underwater when it comes time to sell.\"\n\nThink you're ready to buy a home? See how much house you can afford:", "description": "If you're thinking about making a career change, or just don't want to do things like shovel snow, renting might be a better option for you.", "authors": ["Ashley Abramson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d82ad372e22af0a8178a6e7-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
