The Valley has been closed to the public since Friday, and an attempt to break in by a small number of Franco supporters to hear morning Mass on Saturday was foiled by a line of police.\n\nThe government\u2019s keenness to avoid direct clashes with the small, but persistent, hard-right groups of Franco supporters is palpable and it claims the aim of exhuming Franco\u2019s remains by 25 October is to ensure it does not overlap with the upcoming election campaign.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The biggest is the Valley of the Fallen itself, which contains the bodies of some 33,000 Republicans taken from unmarked sites on Franco\u2019s orders, and then reburied alongside the man indirectly responsible for their execution.\n\n\u201cFranco\u2019s exhumation is an important step, particularly given the enormous difficulties it\u2019s faced since parliament voted for it,\u201d Arturo Peinado, president of the Federations of Foro por la Memoria, says, citing opposition \u201cfrom Franco\u2019s family, as well as some judges and part of the Church. It\u2019s been a fight between democracy and what\u2019s left of Franco and fascism in this country.\u201d\n\nYet another strand of the Valley of the Fallen story is tourism. Even on Saturday morning, Madrid travel agents still had pictures and leaflets offering coach trips to the site on display \u2013 despite then informing customers the Valley was closed.\n\nOne US tourist disappointed at having her Valley visit abruptly cancelled was Judith from Cincinnati. \u201cI\u2019m trying to understand the Spanish Civil War and I thought it would have given me an insight,\u201d she said.\n\nOne Spanish Valley guide in her 20s did not think that Franco\u2019s exhumation would affect the tourist trade \u201cbut a lot will depend on what happens afterwards\u201d.\n\nThere is talk of making the Valley a civil war museum, but she also points out that it\u2019s likely Falangistas \u2013 supporters of Spain\u2019s Fascist Party \u2013 will still gather there \u201cbecause Primo de Rivera, their founder, is buried in front of the main altar. Everybody talks about Franco but nobody mentions that.\u201d\n\nFranco\u2019s headline status will doubtless be overshadowed this coming week, though, by the politically explosive news of the verdict from the trial of the Catalan separatist leaders. But the exhumation, once it happens, will surely be writ large in Spain\u2019s current political agenda once more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so strange that it should form part of this general election campaign; for the last four years, we\u2019ve been more or less constantly in pre-or-post electoral situations,\u201d Peinado points out. \u201cAt some point the exhumation had to happen, and it\u2019s happening now.\u201d", "description": "Forty-four years have passed since his death in 1975 finally brought one of Europe\u2019s longest modern-day dictatorships to an end, but as a general election looms, General Franco is once again a hot political topic in Spain.", "authors": ["Alasdair Fotheringham"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/13/15/valley-of-the-fallen.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
