How the heck does that work in a three-on-three fighting game? Interestingly.\n\nYesterday I checked out the upcoming One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows at Bandai Namco headquarters. It\u2019s yet another fighting game adaptation of an anime, but with a twist.\n\nOr better yet, a gimmick.\n\nPlayers can select Saitama for their third slot. They cannot use them before that, and the game has a small window with a timer showing Saitama running to the fighting stage.\n\nIt seemed to take him over 100 seconds to get to the stage. Prior to that, he cannot be switched out, meaning that until he shows up, you\u2019re stuck with only two fighters.\n\nAlso, the exact amount of time it takes Saitama to get there depends on the other two fighters you select. So, if you select two strong fighters, it will take Saitama slightly longer to arrive. Selecting two weaker ones means he\u2019ll get there in a somewhat more timely fashion. During the fight, if you are doing well, you can score points that subtract time from Saitama\u2019s clock as he races to the stage.\n\nThis is clever. In the anime, Saitama is always late for his fights, so this is a smart way to help balance the character\u2019s power.\n\nThe problem is, though, once he arrives, he\u2019ll end the fight in a single punch. He is, after all, One Punch Man. In matches I fought in and watched, it didn\u2019t seem possible for the limited number of characters in the demo to defeat him.\n\nHowever, if both players select One Punch Man, then they are evenly matched. Conceptually, I really like the idea of how Saitama is used in this fighter. I\u2019m not sure if it would start to feel just like a gimmick after a while or a way to open up deeper strategy.", "description": "Saitama is called \u201cOne Punch Man,\u201d because that\u2019s all it takes for him to level foes.
