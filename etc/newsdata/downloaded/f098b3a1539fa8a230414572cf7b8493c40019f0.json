The demonstrations began in response to the introduction of legislation that would have allowed the extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China, and have since expanded, in the wake of the bill\u2019s withdrawal, into a broader call for increased human rights protections and democratic reforms.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s decisions last week to accommodate the Chinese government by taking down HKMaps is deeply concerning,\u201d read the letter to Cook, which was signed by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, (D, N.Y.), Senator Ted Cruz, (R, Texas), Senator Marco Rubio (R, Fla.) and four other lawmakers.\n\n\u201cIn promoting values, as in most things, actions matter far more than words,\u201d the lawmakers said.\n\nThe letter urges Apple to reverse the company\u2019s decision to censor at least 2,200 apps in China \u201cat the behest of the Chinese government\u201d and instead \u201cstand with the brave men and women fighting for basic rights and dignity in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers cited separate controversies involving China\u2019s efforts to influence American companies, including the NBA and video game maker Blizzard.\n\nSome Chinese sponsors of the NBA pulled their support several weeks ago after Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted and deleted a logo with the phrase, \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\u201d The NBA then released an apologetic statement distancing itself from Morey\u2019s tweet, a move that was met with severe criticism in the U.S.\n\n\u201cYou have said publicly that you want to work with China\u2019s leaders to effect change rather than sit on the sidelines and yell at them,\u201d the bipartisan group of lawmakers told Cook. \u201cWe, too, believe that diplomacy and trade can be democratizing forces. But when a repressive government refuses to evolve or, indeed, when it doubles down, cooperation can become complicity.\u201d\n\nSenators Ron Wyden (D, Ore.) and Tom Cotton (R, Ark.), Representative Mike Gallagher, (R, Wis.), and Representative Tom Malinowski (D, N.J.) also signed the letter.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "A bipartisan group of lawmakers sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook on Friday urging him to \u201cdemonstrate that Apple puts values above market access\u201d by reversing a decision to remove an app that allowed pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong to track police officers.The app, HKMap.live, used crowdsourcing", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XOMZ2jq_jjMwm5G1yMjyUg--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/d64c8bb99a534fc1e8c48e7ff006c69c", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
