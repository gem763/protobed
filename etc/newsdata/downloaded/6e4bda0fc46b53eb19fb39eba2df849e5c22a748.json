Virgilio will serve 60 years in prison for setting fire to the couch on which her boyfriend, Michael Gonzalez, was sleeping in 2012.\n\nMichael Gonzalez with his former girlfriend Gina Virgilio, who was sentenced to 99 years, with 39 years suspended, for the first-degree murder of starting a fire that killed him seven years ago\n\n'I hate me for what I did. I can never bring him back,' she said.\n\nOn the night of June 7, 2012, Virgilio and Gonzalez held a party for Gonzalez's 24th birthday.\n\nWhile he passed out or fell asleep on the couch early the next morning after drinking beer, she found a gas can and walked a quarter mile to the nearest gas station.\n\nWhen she got there, she only had 53 cents in her pocket, so the clerk gave her $5 for gas.\n\nVirgilio then walked back to the apartment, stared at her boyfriend for a while and doused the couch, the carpet in front of it and the area in front of the apartment's only doorway with gasoline.\n\nShe lit mail on fire and tossed it inside. When she saw Gonzalez get up and yell \"hot, hot\" she shut the door and fled. He died from smoke inhalation and severe burns.\n\nA pensive Gina Virgilio will be in jail, essentially, for the rest of her life as she learns her sentence in an Anchorage, Alaska courtroom Monday. She told the judge: 'I hate me for what I did. I can never bring him back,'\n\nGonzalez family members gave heart-wrenching victim impact statements to the court on Oct. 4.\n\nOutside the courtroom, the victim's youngest brother was relieved with the sentence and happy to have the seven-year ordeal over.\n\n'I believe as long as she gets out at a late enough age to where she's not a danger to me, my family or society, I'm OK with it,' Austine Gonzalez said.\n\nVirgilio entered a plea deal earlier this year, and the state agreed to a sentence of 30 to 70 years. But during sentencing Monday, the state pushed for 70 years, noting circumstances of the crime warranted the higher end.\n\n'I think the court considered and made an appropriate sentence,' Anchorage Assistant District Attorney Patrick McKay said.\n\nVirgilio's public defender, Craig Howard, declined comment.\n\nVirgilio's supporters spoke on her behalf Monday, including a brother and three representatives of organizations that help at the prison.\n\nHer brother, Reginald Carney, said he was closest to Gina among the family's six siblings.\n\nGina Virgilio said at her sentencing Monday that mental illness drove her to kill her boyfriend in 2012. 'You can't make sense out of a mind that makes no sense'\n\nHe said she began to change after experimenting with drugs, at about age 20, everything from Oxycontin and marijuana to cocaine.\n\nShe later graduated to intravenous meth use. In January 2012, she disappeared for about two weeks, attending a meth-fueled party that began a six-month decline into drug psychosis ending with Gonzalez's murder.\n\n'Her brain was fried from the meth,' Howard said.\n\nShe lost weight, kept distance from loved ones and once tried to kill her child. She also became obsessed with fire, Howard said.\n\nThe state eventually took the child from her, shortly before she set the apartment ablaze. Before the fire, her brother took her to the emergency room, fearful she would harm herself.\n\nGina Virgilio is led away in handcuffs Monday in Anchorage, Alaska. Virgilio will serve 60 years in prison for killing her boyfriend, Michael Gonzalez, in 2012 by setting the couch fire to the couch on which he was sleeping.\n\nShe was released after about three hours with the prognosis of drug-induced psychosis, which would pass.\n\nAfter the fire, she tested negative for drugs and alcohol.", "description": "Gina Virgilio is sentenced to 99 years with 39 years suspended for killing her boyfriend Michael Gonzalez by fire.
