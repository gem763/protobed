He said Zurich has lost some business because of the decision.\n\nIn the months ahead, Zurich will launch a climate-risk advisory service for clients, it said this week.\n\nMr. Greco discussed his approach to managing environmental, social and governance risks in a recent interview in New York. Here is an edited and condensed transcript.\n\nQ: Why are companies so far behind in their planning for climate-related risks?\n\nIt isn\u2019t a good explanation, but it\u2019s real: Every organization is very slow to adapt. Organizations are built to continue prolonging their reality forever\u2026The consequences? It\u2019s not just the risk management; it\u2019s what you do after that. You do risk management. You find out that something you do is not positive. You have to rethink what to do. You have to rethink the way your people work. You have to rethink your targets, and that\u2019s tough.\n\nQ: How are companies tracking ESG metrics internally? And are they giving Zurich a look at their climate-risk exposures?\n\nThere are many metrics these days, and there are lots of indexes by [ESG] ratings agencies. The problem is they are different and also they are aggregated. We need to have disaggregated metrics, and especially for [tracking our environmental] commitments.\n\nQ: You put in place a new financial strategy when you joined the company. How about on the culture side? What kinds of changes have you made?\n\nI\u2019m trying to move the company toward a long-term vision. One mistake which has been made, I believe, in the Western world is to have an excessive short-term orientation in running the business and reporting on the businesses.\n\nWe eliminated quarterly reports. Now we only report twice a year.\n\nQ: What has changed as a result?\n\nI think the frenzy of what\u2019s going to be next week\u2019s result has gone away, internally and externally. As a philosophy, I think if we all switch ourselves to running businesses for longer periods of time, we will start caring for things that we haven\u2019t been caring for that much. Employee engagement\u2014short term, it doesn\u2019t really matter; a quarterly target is a financial issue. If I have a five-year, 10-year vision, employee engagement is fundamental.\n\nQ: What kinds of investments have you made in your employees?\n\nMany. We developed training for people. We redefined career progression, making sure people understand what the company is doing for them over a long period of time, making sure they understand there will be a reward for them over time personally by being with the company. We redefined the purpose of the company.\n\nQ: What are some examples?\n\nWe are training people on [artificial intelligence]. We are training people on cybercrime, on everything which is innovative. But the way we want to do this is, I don\u2019t train you. I give you the opportunity to get the training. I pay for you, but you need to be the one willing to train yourself.\n\nQ: Are you giving your employees a stipend?\n\nStarting next year we want to develop this into giving a kind of training wallet to people, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s the opportunity. Train yourself if you believe this is important for you.\u201d\n\nQ: You talk a lot about creating long-term value. Would you be willing to take a short-term hit to profits in the name of investing in your labor force?\n\nIn a sense I think the question is not legitimate\u2026If you want to maximize the short-term profits of an organization, you take financial actions. You act on some financial levers, and you achieve it. If you want to achieve long-term profits for the organization, you have to invest in new developments and machinery. You have to invest in skills.\n\n\u2026I run a company for profits, but my profits should be sustainable over a long time. This is what I\u2019m trying to do, and this is the culture I\u2019m trying to bring in the organization. If you want to do that, then naturally you start thinking about these other things. You start thinking about the communities. You start thinking about the employee satisfaction. You start thinking about the customer satisfaction. You start thinking about sustainability.\n\nWrite to Kristin Broughton at kristin.broughton@wsj.com", "description": "Zurich Insurance CEO Mario Greco says it is important to have a long-term viewpoint when dealing with environmental, social and governance issues.", "authors": ["Kristin Broughton", "Kristin.Broughton Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-110754/social", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
