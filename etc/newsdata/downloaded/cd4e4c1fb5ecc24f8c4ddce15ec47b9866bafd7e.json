REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration/File Photo\n\nThomas Cook agreed the key terms of a 900 million pound ($1.1 billion) recapitalization plan in a deal with Chinese shareholder Fosun (1992.HK) last month, but on Thursday a source said that lenders were demanding another 200 million pounds in underwritten funds to maintain their support.\n\n\u201cDiscussions to agree final terms on the recapitalization and reorganization of the company are continuing between the company and a range of stakeholders,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThese discussions include a recent request for a seasonal standby facility of 200 million pounds, on top of the previously announced 900 million pounds injection of new capital.\u201d\n\nA source close to the discussions said on Thursday that Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) (RBS.L) had hit Thomas Cook with a last minute demand for the extra funding, adding that the situation \u201cwas becoming more critical\u201d.\n\nA spokesman for RBS said the bank did not \u201crecognize this characterization of events\u201d and was working with all parties to \u201ctry and find a resolution to the funding and liquidity shortfall at Thomas Cook.\u201d\n\nUnder the original terms of the plan, Fosun - whose Chinese parent owns all-inclusive holiday firm Club Med - would contribute 450 million pounds ($552 million) of new money in return for at least 75% of the tour operator business and 25% of the group\u2019s airline.\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s lending banks and bondholders were to stump up a further 450 million pounds and convert their existing debt to equity, giving them in total about 75% of the airline and up to 25% in the tour operator business, the group said.\n\n\u201cThe recapitalization is expected to result in existing shareholders\u2019 interests being significantly diluted, with significant risk of no recovery,\u201d Thomas Cook said on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe Company will provide further updates in due course.\u201d", "description": "Britain's Thomas Cook said its banks had ordered the company to find an additional 200 million pounds ($251 million) of funding in order to guarantee the survival of the world's oldest holiday company.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431891478&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0FX-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
