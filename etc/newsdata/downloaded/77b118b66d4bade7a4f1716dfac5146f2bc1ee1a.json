It\u2019s a business, of course, with a business model that makes much of its money by channeling tidings of sludge around, often to great harm.\n\nAfter helping give us Donald Trump as president and mass killings in places where a lie can dash around the world before truth puts on its pants, Facebook has lately been playacting as a good citizen. Which is to say, it\u2019s courting lawmakers and regulators in a bid to remain the world\u2019s most powerful gatekeeper of information.\n\nThe highlight of the latest charm tour was the speech last week at Georgetown by Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. He cited the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Frederick Douglass, and painted himself as a defender of free expression in the marketplace of ideas.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re in the right place on this,\u201d Zuckerberg said, explaining why the company would not stop politicians from using Facebook to spread lies. \u201cI think people should be able to hear for themselves what politicians are saying.\u201d", "description": "The Facebook founder\u2019s speech at Georgetown was a profile in cowardice.", "authors": ["Timothy Egan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/opinion/25Egan/25Egan-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
