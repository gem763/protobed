(Carol Guzy/The Washington Post)\n\nFor nearly a decade, Ryan Diviney existed in a vegetative state, a beating heart inside a paralyzed body, the result of being kicked in the head during a catastrophic beating that altered the course of his young life and the lives of those who loved him.\n\nHis father, Ken, who after the attack quit his job to devote himself to Ryan\u2019s daily care at home, was beside his son when he died Saturday, at age 29, while they drove to a hospital in Winchester, Va.\n\nThe Divineys, who reside in Ashburn, Va., had been at their West Virginia cabin for the holiday weekend when Ryan\u2019s pulse quickened at an alarming rate and he struggled to breathe, his father recalled in a telephone interview Monday.\n\nKen Diviney decided to take his son to the hospital, a trip that was all too common for Ryan, who underwent a couple of dozen surgical procedures and had appeared on the brink of death at various points after two men attacked him in Morgantown, W.Va., in 2009.\n\nAs they sped toward Winchester, Ryan appeared to lose consciousness. Ken Diviney said he pulled over on the side of a road, instructed his wife to call 911 and administered CPR to his son.\n\n[Since beating that left student in coma, his father has kept a constant vigil]\n\nBy the time an ambulance arrived, Ryan had \u201cstiffened up and his head dropped. He went limp,\u201d his father said, his voice choked with tears. \u201cI\u2019m shattered. I knew it would come eventually, but I didn\u2019t think it would hurt like this. \u201d\n\nHandsome and gregarious, Ryan Diviney loved baseball and football as a youngster. An entire bookshelf in the Divineys\u2019 family room was devoted to trophies and game balls commemorating the boy\u2019s triumphs \u2014 a grand slam one day, a homer, triple and two singles on another.\n\nAfter graduating from Broad Run High School, Ryan Diviney enrolled at West Virginia University in Morgantown, where he had ideas about going into law. Maybe he would be a judge one day, he told his parents. Or a U.S. senator.\n\nOn Nov. 7, 2009, Ryan and a friend got into a verbal altercation with a group of young men outside a Dairy Mart convenience store in Morgantown. At one point, Jonathan May, a WVU student, sneaked up behind Ryan and punched him in the face.\n\nRyan fell to the ground, after which Austin Vantrease, 19, kicked him in the head, using a motion that a witness compared to \u201cpunting\u201d a football, police said. Ryan\u2019s jaw was broken, his skull was fractured in two places, and he was bleeding from his brain.\n\nAt the hospital, doctors told Ken and Sue Diviney that they could leave their son as he was and that he would probably die. Or they could remove part of his skull, allowing his brain to swell. In either scenario, doctors said their son might not live longer than 48 hours. His parents chose to have a portion of his skull plate removed.\n\nMay was later convicted of misdemeanor battery and sentenced to a year in prison. Vantrease, who was convicted of malicious assault, spent four years in prison before being paroled in 2014.\n\nAt Vantrease\u2019s 2010 sentencing hearing, Ken Diviney told the judge that his \u201cfantasy\u201d was to spend \u201ctwo minutes\u201d with his son\u2019s attacker \u201cin a locked room with a baseball bat.\u201d Vantrease, Diviney said, \u201cwon\u2019t come out in any worse condition than my son.\u201d\n\nNine years later, Diviney said he remains angry at the two men who beat his son. For the past 10 years, he said, \u201cdeath has always been on our doorstep, peeking in the window all the time.\u201d\n\nBut his thoughts are also focused on friends and strangers who helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for Ryan\u2019s medical care over the past decade. \u201cMy soul is in debt,\u201d he said.\n\nHis wife, Sue, an executive at Fox 5 DC, kept working after their son\u2019s attack, in part to maintain the family\u2019s health insurance. Their daughter, Kari, now 28, became a special-education teacher, inspired by her brother\u2019s plight, her father said.\n\nKen Diviney acknowledged that he will now have to find a new focus. In the meantime, he said, he has to adjust to his son no longer being his ever-present, if silent, companion.\n\n\u201cAfter leaving the hospital the other day, I see this person driving erratically, and I said, \u2018Hey, Ryan, look at how bad this driver is,\u2019 \u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd then I realized he wasn\u2019t there. I\u2019m just so used to him being there. And now he isn\u2019t.\u201d", "description": "Diviney, 29, once a star athlete, never recovered from near-fatal brain injuries.", "authors": ["Paul Schwartzman", "Reporter Specializing In Political Profiles", "Narratives About Life", "Death", "Everything In Between", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zH_62QtBTysSsCwoBDb_wAzaoSE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3MEXCIGNXQI6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg"}
