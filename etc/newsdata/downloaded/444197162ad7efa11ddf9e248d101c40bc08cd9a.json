The roughly $500 million loss Constellation just reported includes its share in the June warrant modification, as well as equity losses, the company said.\n\nConstellation's struggles with Canopy date back further. In June, Constellation CEO Bill Newlands expressed his discontent with the weed company's earnings during Constellation's own earnings call \u2014 Bruce Linton, the former chief executive officer of Canopy Growth, left the company shortly after. In an interview with CNBC in July, Newlands said the company \"needed focus\" and a different leader for its \"next phase of growth.\"\n\nOutside of the investment in cannabis, Constellation reported solid gains in beer. Modelo sales grew 15% during the quarter, and Corona Refresca and Corona Premier also posted strong growth.\n\nConstellation Brands is up 22% year to date.\n\nMarkets Insider", "description": "Constellation Brands, the company behind Corona and Modelo beer, posted second quarter earnings that largely beat expectations but revealed a $484 million...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/58c85f606ff80121008b4cc1-2000/undefined"}
