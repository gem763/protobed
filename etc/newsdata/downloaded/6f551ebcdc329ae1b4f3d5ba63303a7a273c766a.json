Solve the running back spot and you generally rule in fantasy. But there are plenty of high-capital guys who have disappointed us in the opening three weeks.\n\nToday, we take a look at four of them \u2014 and try to give you an actionable path moving forward. As always, you gotta season this to taste for your particular context. You know your league better than anyone else. Trading habits and FAAB habits are different in every room. No matter what we say, a number of comments will start off with \u201cBut in my league ...\u201d Got it; it\u2019s all contextual.\n\nFree free to add the \u201c... But in my league ...\u201d reactions below. If you want to go deeper than that, I\u2019m on Twitter, @scott_pianowski.\n\nHave you gotten sick of these frustrating RBs yet? (Photo by Amber Matsumoto/Yahoo Sports)\n\nSony Michel, Patriots\n\nThe Patriots went against type with a first-round selection of Michel in 2018, and it\u2019s starting to look like a mistake. He came into the league with injury baggage, and the team has no problem finding running back talent, anyway.\n\nStory continues\n\nMichel went absolutely nowhere in the wins over Pittsburgh and the Jets; a collective 24 carries for 25 yards. He was mediocre in the win at Miami \u2014 21 rushes, 83 yards. A couple of touchdowns provided welcome deodorant, but a 2.4 YPC is embarrassing. And we know Michel is a zero in the passing game (seven career catches, none this year).\n\nA struggling New England offensive line will probably come around \u2014 OL coach Dante Scarnecchia is a legend who can fix just about anything. But will Michel be healthy enough to benefit? Will Michel be able to make unblocked defenders miss, something he\u2019s been awful at this year? And keep in mind, James White is a more talented receiver than Michel, while Rex Burkhead is the most versatile back on the roster.\n\nMichel\u2019s struggles have caught the eye of many in the community, so if you decide to sell right this second, it\u2019s a sell-low. I\u2019m not dismissing that out of hand, but I\u2019d prefer you try to wait until he stumbles into a good game, even if it\u2019s masked by a touchdown or two, and then take to the market. No matter if you decide to time this or act on it now, I do not like Michel as a long-term investment.\n\nGut Call: Wait for a solid game, then look to sell.\n\nTodd Gurley, Rams\n\nThe Rams are one of several NFL clubs that tend to be secretive and even misleading about their intentions, but while their words are often meaningless or deceptive, their actions can scream loudly. And when the Rams went out of their way to prioritize keeping Malcolm Brown and drafting Darrell Henderson in the offseason, it spoke greatly on Gurley.\n\nGurley\u2019s efficiency has been fine \u2014 4.6 yards a pop \u2014 though the Rams offensive line has not graded well. But Gurley no longer is a monster in the passing game (just four catches, eight yards) and he only has one of the team\u2019s four rushing touchdowns. In Gurley\u2019s best days, he was gifted the short touchdowns and the easy chunk plays in the passing game. Those days might not be coming back.\n\nGurley is tied for 18th in running back touches, and that links to where his fantasy value probably lies. Now keep in mind, catches are more valuable than rushes when it comes to those RB touches, but we\u2019ll take what we can get. Gurley probably is a middle-to-lesser RB2 until further notice, and he\u2019s no guarantee to be the top touchdown man on this offense. I am not tied to Gurley, and the price would have to be awfully low for me to jump in now.\n\nGut Call: A credible support player, no longer a superstar; forget the name, focus on the numbers.\n\nChris Carson, Seahawks\n\nYou want consistency, Carson is giving it. He\u2019s carried the ball 15 times in each of his three starts \u2014 and he\u2019s fumbled in each game, too. You know what coach really hates fumbles? All of them.\n\nThere are some silver linings in the Carson playbook. OC Brian Schottenheimer is insistent on a run-heavy scheme, no matter that he has Russell Wilson at quarterback. Carson\u2019s main competitor, Rashaad Penny, has a mediocre resume and isn\u2019t healthy at the moment. C.J. Prosise is a specialty option, a satellite back at best. When Pete Carroll gives Carson a vote of confidence, it\u2019s probably in part because there\u2019s no obvious card to play.\n\nI\u2019m sticking with Carson. He\u2019s tied to an offense that prioritizes him. He\u2019s already halfway to last season\u2019s 20 catches \u2014 he\u2019ll never make anyone forget Marshall Faulk, but he\u2019s no longer just a two-down grinder. The pieces after him are ordinary. Not all of the fumbles were blunders, either \u2014 sometimes a defender makes a nasty hit or strip and deserves credit.\n\nGut Call: Probably a guy to hold.\n\nDevonta Freeman, Falcons\n\nThe Falcons wanted to rebuild the offensive line this year, but it\u2019s turned into an injury-ravaged flop. Perhaps that\u2019s why Atlanta keeps scoring all of its touchdowns through the air; it\u2019s generally more plausible to mask your OL problems through the passing game. Freeman went nowhere in two starts, before breaking free for a solid 95-yard game at Indianapolis.\n\nFreeman\u2019s running style (and the occupational hazards of the position) have taxed him recently; he missed most of the 2018 season and has just one full year out of four. He\u2019s currently sitting at the lowest YPC of his carer, a comment on the line struggling and Freeman failing to make yards after contact. He\u2019s no longer a proactive part of the passing game; forget the Freeman who caught 73 passes in 2015 and 54 balls in 2016. Last week\u2019s lofty snap share was driven by two other backs getting hurt.\n\nThe best case for Freeman is the depth behind him; maybe Ito Smith or Brian Hill will eventually carve out a secondary role, but no one is really pushing Freeman. Perhaps the line will gel eventually. For better or for worse, Freeman is the best option the team has at the moment.\n\nGut Call: Probably a forced hold, but not someone I\u2019d have any loyalty to if trades presented themselves.\n\nListen to the Yahoo Fantasy Football Podcast", "description": "Time to audit four running backs driving fantasy gamers crazy, including Los Angeles' Todd Gurley and New England's Sony Michel.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/H3c6UVjX1DIM4Bnane1tgw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD02ODkuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mPY7LFJvGCD4fVUhcIMhUA--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/5500a570-dfd3-11e9-bec6-02f0e0631f07", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
