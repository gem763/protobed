The median price target for the stock is $48, representing an upside of more than 38% to Thursday's close.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)", "description": "The brokerage has assumed the strike by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, currently in its 26-day, to last until Oct. 21.
