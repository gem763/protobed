Well, the results were mixed. Sure, Gurley had a solid day \u2014 14 carries, 97 yards, one catch, four yards \u2014 but his supposed backup, Malcolm Brown, won the fantasy day.\n\nBrown put up 53 rushing yards, but scored two touchdowns. His 11 touches to Gurley\u2019s 15 isn\u2019t a bad ratio, either. It seems clear that Brown \u2014 and not Darrell Henderson \u2014 is going to be more than just someone to spell Gurley on this Rams offense. Brown seems to have a pivotal role here, and it\u2019s one that can help fantasy gamers in Week 2.\n\nTodd Gurley played 70% of the offensive snaps, Malcolm Brown 26%, Darrell Henderson 3%.\n\n\n\nGurley: 14 car, 97 yds\n\nBrown: 11 car, 53 yds, 2 TD \u2014 James Koh (@JamesDKoh) September 8, 2019\n\nMarquise \u201cHollywood\u201d Brown, Baltimore Ravens (31% rostered)\n\nStory continues\n\nTalk about a regular season debut. Lamar Jackson stole many of the headlines \u2014 and well-deserved, too \u2014 but his most productive target on the day deserves some attention. Brown took just four catches on five targets and turned them into 147 yards and two touchdowns. The rookie torched the Miami Dolphins defense time and time again. Jackson\u2019s progression as a passer \u2014 which took a giant step forward in this game \u2014 only further increases Brown\u2019s potential as a fantasy asset going forward.\n\nChris Conley, Jacksonville Jaguars (1%)\n\nUnfortunately, the Jaguars lost their starting quarterback, Nick Foles, to a broken clavicle, and so Gardner Minshew entered the game in his stead. The rookie performed admirably against the Chiefs powerhouse, all things considered. His favorite option? None other than former Chief, Chris Conley, who converted a team-leading seven targets into six catches for 97 yards and a touchdown. Conley could see more big days like this with Minshew under center and is a waiver candidate in deeper leagues.", "description": "We look ahead to Week 2 with some fantasy football pickups, led by a couple of \"Browns\" = Malcolm and Hollywood!", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mRN.jL70wTjSqY3_hENOcQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTYuNTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OIagZ2QAsyMdEGYGvdmbcw--~B/aD0yMDA4O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/7b29eb70-d28c-11e9-a5f7-8551ad0f61ad", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
