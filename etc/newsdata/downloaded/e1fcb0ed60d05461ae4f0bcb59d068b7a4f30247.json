Okay, Pete what would you have said?\u2019 Ben asked.\n\n\u2018I can think of Heidi,\u2019 replied Pete.\n\nAnne Frank was very much a real person (Picture: Getty)\n\nBen then revealed that Anne Frank was, in fact, incorrect and that Heidi was what he was looking for, adding: \u2018Anne Frank was a real-life person of course.\u2019\n\n\u2018I knew that, I couldn\u2019t think of anybody else,\u2019 Steph said.\n\nViewers were shocked by Steph\u2019s answer\n\n#tippingpoint So Steph is a teacher and she thinks Anne Frank is a made-up character in a book. Says a lot about the state of the education system in this country \u2014 Louise Allen (@darciebean) October 22, 2019\n\nHow the hell can u not know Anne Frank is a real person? #tippingpoint \u2014 inganelson (@inganelson13) October 22, 2019\n\nhang on if Anne Frank is fictional does that mean Heidi is real ? #tippingpoint \u2014 Happy Gaz (@gaz_happy) October 22, 2019\n\nDid she really just say Anne Frank!? #TippingPoint pic.twitter.com/dMF6r5zgJT \u2014 Felix Wood (@felixw1) October 22, 2019\n\nA teacher thinks Anne Frank is a fictional character #tippingpoint \u2026.

Please please tell me you didn\u2019t just say that?!\u2019\n\nEchoing a similar sentiment, another said: \u2018Hang on if Anne Frank is fictional does that mean Heidi is real?\u2019\n\nAnne Frank was a German-born Dutch-Jewish diarist and remains one of the most discussed Jewish victims of the Holocaust.\n\nShe gained fame posthumously with the publication of her diary The Diary of a Young Girl.\n\nUnfortunately, Steph walked home after losing out to Pete in the head-to-head as the game show continued.\n\nPete, however, went on to bag an impressive \u00a33450.\n\nTipping Point airs weekdays at 4pm on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
