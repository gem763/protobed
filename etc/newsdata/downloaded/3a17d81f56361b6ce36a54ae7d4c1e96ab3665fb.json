The policy means that parents will be hit with a $3,000 fee if their child drops out of school.\n\nLorde, who shot to fame during her high school years after the release of her debut album Pure Heroine, dropped out of high school to focus on her music career. You know, because she\u2019s LORDE. Even if she never plays music again, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s got great connections that\u2019ll keep her from ever being unemployed.\n\nLorde, real name Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O\u2019Connor has released two records since bursting onto the scene back in high school, Pure Heroine and Melodrama. And fans are screaming for a third album, but if Lorde goes to jail, we might have to wait a little longer.\n\nBut after Newshub used her as an example in their article about the proposed new policy, fans jumped to huge conclusions that she\u2019d be going to jail if she refused to pay the fine.\n\nIn case you\u2019ve forgotten, she\u2019s Lorde. I\u2019m sure she could pay $3,000 if she was asked to. But this isn\u2019t even a real policy, so nobody has to pay a cent. Drop out of school all you like, children of New Zealand. Live your life.\n\nBut the only thing better than the fact that some people actually believed that Lorde was in jail, is the memes that surfaced on Twitter. Memes, glorious memes.\n\nPray for my girl Lorde ???? \u2026 nothing\u2019s wrong with her, she\u2019s just going to jail #FreeLORDE pic.twitter.com/rghxHjj0as \u2014 Devin McGuire (@MrMcGuireSir) October 9, 2019\n\nlorde stans running to the jail where lorde is being kept #freeLORDE pic.twitter.com/YNRreG7TEe \u2014 virgo rights #freeLORDE (@lordesjuul) October 9, 2019", "description": "The hashtag #FreeLorde has gone viral in recent days as fans mock an article that claimed Lorde would be in jail under proposed NZ National policy.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-962830488.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
