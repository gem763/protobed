Margaret told how Jim would write three letters a day to her while serving with the Border Regiment.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to have my story out there. I have 633 letters from my husband which formed the basis of the story.\n\n\u201cIt became about my life. It builds up the point where a boy falls in love and stays in love.\n\n(Image: Lee McLean / SWNS)\n\n(Image: Margaret Ford / SWNS)\n\n\u201cThe letters are still very important to me today, they\u2019re very special.\u201d\n\nThe book, which took three years to write, tells how Margaret met Jim while he was home on leave from Burma as the Second World War neared its end.\n\nShe said: \u201cI was at a dance when I saw Jim walk in. The two of us got talking. We got on very well indeed.\u201d\n\nBut Margaret\u2019s book also recounts a relationship she had with an American military medic called Hank, who arrived in Britain for D-Day.\n\nBut it broke down as she did not want to move to the States with him.\n\n(Image: Margaret Ford / SWNS)\n\n(Image: Margaret Ford / SWNS)\n\nAfter tying the knot with Jim, Margaret, of \u00adBlackburn, followed him to Egypt and \u00adSingapore. She opened military bookshops to pass time.\n\nJim died in 2013 and Margaret decided to pen an account of their time together. She approached a ghost writer who published it on her behalf.\n\nAnd she is now thinking of writing a sequel. Margaret added: \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how many stories you have.\u201d", "description": "Margaret Ford\u2019s has just released A Daughter\u2019s Choice based on romantic letters she sent to her late husband Jim", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Lee Mclean", "Swns", "Margaret Ford"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20578431.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_SWNS_OLDEST_NOVELIST_20.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
