(Scott Taetsch/Getty Images)\n\nThis series, against a team fighting for something, was supposed to provide the Washington Nationals the competitive trial run for the playoffs that the checked-out Philadelphia Phillies didn\u2019t. This series was supposed to be a pressure-packed three days in which the Cleveland Indians fought for their lives while the Nationals clawed to maintain home-field advantage for the National League wild-card game. This series, after one game, looks as if it will be bereft of most of those stakes.\n\nThe Nationals snuffed out the Phillies\u2019 season three days ago and claimed another Friday night by clubbing their way to an 8-2 victory. Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera\u2019s two-run double and Trea Turner\u2019s two-run homer in the pivotal sixth inning secured the victory and, with the Tampa Bay Rays\u2019 win, the Indians\u2019 elimination.\n\nThe Nationals, meanwhile, captured their sixth win in five days to extend their wild-card lead to two games over the Milwaukee Brewers, who lost on the road to the Colorado Rockies. Washington also leads the St. Louis Cardinals, who lost to the Chicago Cubs, by one game, and it can clinch home-field advantage in the wild-card game with one more win.\n\nManager Dave Martinez said he was proud of his team for playing as hard as it has after clinching.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what I always talk about: I want to keep these guys motivated. I want to keep them going,\u201d he said. \u201cI want all these guys to get their at-bats and just keep playing good baseball.\u201d\n\n[Ryan Zimmerman is at the end of his deal, and it\u2019s hard to imagine the Nats without him]\n\nThis sudden dip in pressure does not change the Nationals\u2019 plans. They wanted to use this last weekend to rest regulars and experiment as they did in the opener anyway. Martinez sees this weekend as a chance to rev up those who haven\u2019t played regularly, such as Brian Dozier, Ryan Zimmerman, Matt Adams and Gerardo Parra. He wanted Cabrera to pinch-hit. He wanted Howie Kendrick at second base as a tuneup (and a potential playoff preview). Kendrick has a .410 batting average in September, the best mark in baseball, and they want to keep him in the lineup.\n\nThe Nationals also sat everyday center fielder Victor Robles for then-slumping Parra; checked in on young starter Austin Voth, who could be a bullpen arm in the playoffs; and evaluated Kurt Suzuki, who returned to catch his first game since Sept. 7, when he departed a game because of right elbow inflammation.\n\nOf these four, Suzuki\u2019s status is the most pressing. Martinez announced Friday that Max Scherzer will start Tuesday\u2019s wild-card game, and the Nationals ace swears by Suzuki. Scherzer has praised the veteran backstop\u2019s game-calling ability, and the numbers support him: Scherzer has a 2.08 ERA in 99\u2154 innings with Suzuki and a 4.09 ERA in 72 2/ 3 innings with Yan Gomes.\n\n\u201cFelt good,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cFelt like, obviously, energetic in the first couple and then tried to get my legs under me from not being out there on the field.\u201d\n\nHitting is not a problem for Suzuki. He pinch-hit twice during his injury layoff, and he rapped a sharp single to left in his first at-bat Friday. Suzuki\u2019s legs don\u2019t appear to be bothering him, either; he scored from first twice, and though his slides looked like pratfalls, he dusted himself off unscathed. The thing that has held him out of games \u2014 his throwing arm \u2014 wasn\u2019t tested.\n\n\u201cI threw around between innings; just getting it there is always a step forward in the process,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously would\u2019ve liked to throw down hard with somebody stealing, but I don\u2019t think I need to.\u201d\n\n[Nationals name Max Scherzer their starter for the NL wild-card game]\n\nThat was mostly because of Voth, who was perfect in five of his six innings, only running into trouble in the third when he allowed two runs on an infield single, a double and a sacrifice fly. The 27-year-old otherwise showed why Martinez speaks highly of him, and he impressed by throwing 11 of his 18 curveballs for strikes, a sign of progress after a cut on his middle finger limited the effectiveness of those pitches in his previous start.\n\nThe Nationals like Voth\u2019s stuff, which he showed in his previous outing with one swing-and-miss every four pitches. He didn\u2019t post the same rate this time, one every 7.3 pitches, but the Indians swung early and often. Voth seems unlikely to make the wild-card game roster \u2014 the regular relievers plus starters in the bullpen render him superfluous \u2014 but he\u2019s a candidate to pitch if they advance to the best-of-five NL Division Series.\n\n\u201cExactly how I wanted to finish the season,\u201d Voth said, smiling. He added, of his season possibly continuing: \u201cIt\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals continued to show they can compete without their regular lineup, and Parra highlighted that with three hits Friday, one shy of his total since Aug. 13 entering the game. The legend of \u201cBaby Shark\u201d had grown even as his on-field performance slipped, with Nationals Park serenading each of his infrequent at-bats with arm-chomps. But the veteran utility outfielder rebounded in a big way, driving in the Nationals\u2019 first two runs with a deep double in the second inning, singling in the fourth and homering in the eighth. He also had a sacrifice fly in the sixth. Martinez credited the turnaround to Parra keeping his bat in the strike zone longer.\n\n\u201cI want to get him going because he\u2019s going to have a big at-bat in this postseason,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI know he will.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals used none of the relievers Martinez intimated he would want in the wild-card game \u2014 Fernando Rodney, Daniel Hudson and Sean Doolittle \u2014 and Kendrick concluded a solid night of defense by handling a soft grounder for the second out in the ninth. When Tanner Rainey struck out the final batter, Suzuki didn\u2019t have to throw the ball back to him. He walked it there instead.", "description": "Sixth straight win keeps Washington in driver\u2019s seat for home-field advantage in the wild-card game.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter", "September At Pm", "Sam Fortier Is A Sports Reporter For The Washington Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bsLPr6pZqa1VbpuwTNZG7wcSB0I=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/X6TUXVHBS4I6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
