A lack of leaders. A lack of characters. It is a long way back and it is scary just how far they have fallen.\u201d\n\nUnited\u2019s worst performance of the season highlighted the deficiencies in Solskjaer\u2019s squad after an offseason when the club eschewed its recent fixation with making marquee signings, focusing instead on bringing in young, hungry British players more likely to buy into United\u2019s culture.\n\nIt led to the arrival of 21-year-olds Daniel James and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, along with England defender Harry Maguire for 80 million pound ($97 million). Out went attackers Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez to Inter Milan, who weren\u2019t replaced.\n\nSolskjaer now has just two senior forwards in his squad, Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford, and both are currently out injured.\n\nWith just two wins in its first six league games, United is already 10 points behind first-place Liverpool, historically its biggest rival. A day before Solskjaer\u2019s team slumped at West Ham, Manchester City - United\u2019s other fierce rival - beat Watford 8-0.\n\n\u201cWe are optimistic for the future,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cThe sale and loaning of players this summer has also allowed the manager to involve more of our young players and provide a firm foundation and culture ready for building the next trophy-winning squad.\n\n\u201cReturning to the roots of our club\u2019s ethos, of youth-led attacking football, is the right way forward,\u201d Woodward added. \u201cEveryone at the club - the board, the manager and all the staff - remains resolute in our desire to get Manchester United back to the top of English football.\u201d\n\nUnited, which announced record revenues of 627.1 million pounds ($783 million) for the last financial year, won the last of its 20 top-flight league titles in 2013 - the final season before Alex Ferguson retired.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Injuries are starting to bite, rivals are already pulling clear, and a former captain says it is \"scary\" how far the team has fallen.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/britain_soccer_premier_league_87605_c0-125-3005-1877_s1770x1032.jpg?5c89961d250ff8aafc09a00a9ce56ea106a35e3d", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
