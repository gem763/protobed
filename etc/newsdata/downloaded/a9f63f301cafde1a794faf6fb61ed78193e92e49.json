They had a deal and as they left Brussels, everyone was happy. But will the EU's relief be short-lived?\n\nAcross the capitals of Europe all eyes will now turn to Westminster, for a rare Saturday session of Parliament to decide the fate of the revised Brexit deal.\n\n\"It is now a matter of putting faith in the British parliament to take its decision,\" said Germany's Angela Merkel.\n\nThey have been here before. Theresa May's deal was rejected three times by MPs. Yet more than 90% of the new deal is\u2026 Theresa May's deal.\n\nThe challenge of having a porous EU external border in Northern Ireland was the stumbling block that needed solving.\n\n'He's colourful sometimes'\n\nFinally the Eurosceptic Boris Johnson, famous for poking fun at EU bureaucracy, won generous praise from EU leaders at the Brussels summit.\n\nOne of his fiercest EU critics on Brexit, French President Emmanuel Macron, spoke of Mr Johnson's \"strategic thinking, his willingness to engage and a wish to persevere\". He added that \"he's colourful sometimes\".\n\nSummit chairman Donald Tusk warmly patted Mr Johnson on the shoulder and Luxembourg PM Xavier Bettel beamed at him - having only recently mocked him for dodging a press conference.\n\nAfter more than three years of tortuous negotiations the EU believes it now has an innovative solution for the Northern Ireland border.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"The Queen will still be the Queen\" - Leo Varadkar\n\nIn one-on-one talks with Irish Taoiseach (PM) Leo Varadkar, before the summit, Boris Johnson accepted that Northern Ireland could keep EU regulatory standards and have a unique customs inspection system.\n\nIt means in effect a customs border in the Irish Sea, with new checks on goods at Northern Ireland's ports and Belfast airport.\n\nGoods destined for the Republic of Ireland - the EU - will come under the EU tariff regime.\n\nThe special arrangement was dictated by both sides' commitment to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. That peace accord demands that there be no \"hard\" land border on the island of Ireland.\n\nBut the Brexit deal would take the UK out of the EU single market and customs union - commonly described as a \"hard\" Brexit.\n\nWhat next?\n\nSo much for the legal technicalities. The big question now is whether Mr Johnson can get the deal through the House of Commons.\n\nA day of high drama is expected, as the vote will be on a knife edge. The government's recent suspension of Parliament - ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court - angered many MPs.\n\nThere was discomfort among EU leaders when asked what they would do if Westminster rejected this deal.\n\nWould they grant another, third, extension to the Brexit negotiations?\n\nMr Varadkar was asked if there was an EU Plan B. His reply: \"Plan B is no deal. Let's hope that doesn't happen.\"\n\nThere was no guarantee of another extension, he said.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Crunching the numbers as MPs prepare for key Brexit vote\n\nThe pressure to meet the 31 October deadline is there in the summit conclusions, calling for the EU to prepare for the deal to \"enter into force on 1 November\".\n\nThe deal allows a transition period until the end of 2020. In contrast, a no-deal scenario would make the UK a \"third country\" overnight, subject to EU tariffs and other barriers immediately.\n\nThe EU's Donald Tusk did not rule out another extension. But President Macron said: \"I don't think that a new delay should be agreed on. I think we need to end the negotiations and move on to talks about future relations.\"\n\nA year is not much time for the EU to negotiate a free trade deal with the UK.\n\nAnd the risk of a no-deal Brexit has not gone away.\n\nBelgium alone could lose 42,000 jobs in the worst-case scenario, according to a Leuven Catholic University study. The port of Zeebrugge does about half of its trade with the UK.\n\nAmid European sadness and frustration over Brexit, there is also some optimism.\n\nMr Varadkar said the EU had shown \"enormous solidarity\" with Ireland, and he called it a union \"in which small states are protected\". And Ulrich Ladurner, Brussels correspondent for Germany's Die Zeit daily, told the BBC: \"Many Europeans feel Brexit has shown the strength of the EU\".", "description": "EU leaders are happy with their Brexit deal with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson - but what happens next?", "authors": ["Laurence Peter", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/63AF/production/_109291552_057361420-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
