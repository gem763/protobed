It might be that the last time you heard from the REITs was when shopping malls were emptying out due to e-commerce competition and everyone was writing an epitaph for mall REITs.\n\nBut those days are gone. And there are far more types of REITs than shopping mall owners (although some of the good ones have recovered well). In this low interest rate environment, REITs are in their prime. They can refinance debt on properties they currently own and save money, and they can also buy properties at lower total costs.\n\nAlso, because of the way REITs are structured, they pay shareholders a cut of their net profit in the form of dividends, so you get a solid income stream. Income should actually be high on the priority list for any growth investor, and I explain why in this free investor briefing.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlso, most of these businesses are U.S.-focused, so external trade problems aren\u2019t an issue to growth. But you can\u2019t just buy any REITs. Quality is important. And, as the shopping mall scenario showed, so are strategic sectors.\n\nBelow, my seven top-notch REITs to buy for income are great choices for the long term.\n\n\n\n\n\nEastGroup Properties (EGP)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDividend Yield: 2.3%\n\nEastGroup Properties (NYSE:EGP) focuses on industrial properties around the U.S. It currently owns distribution facilities in Florida, California, Texas, Arizona and North Carolina.\n\nIf you notice, most of those states have the largest ports in the U.S. and others have distribution hubs for e-commerce. And some have both. The point is, EGP is well positioned to take advantage of the true fuel of the U.S. economy, the U.S. consumer.\n\nAnd this is a very good time to be on this end of the market, as the U.S. economy continues to chug along and rates are likely headed lower.\n\nEGP stock is up 36% in the past 12 months and delivers a solid 2.3% dividend at current levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgree Realty (ADC)\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nDividend Yield: 2.9%\n\nAgree Realty (NYSE:ADC) is a REIT that buys, develops and manages properties for large national retailers outside the mall environment.\n\nIts clients include The TJX Companies\u2019 (NYSE:TJX) T.J. Maxx, Wawa, Hobby Lobby, Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO), Walgreen\u2019s (NASDAQ:WBA) and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY). These are high-quality clients with great credit quality, so the risk of default is minimal.\n\nAlso, ADC operates as a net lease REIT, meaning the client pays all expenses related to property management, taxes and maintenance. This an even better deal for ADC, since it doesn\u2019t have to spend money on any of those issues. When you have an income play where the yield is backed up by a solid business model, that\u2019s a recipe for what I sometimes call Bulletproof Stocks.\n\nADC stock is up 43% in the past year and still delivers a nearly 3% dividend.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpirit Realty Capital (SRC)\n\nSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nDividend Yield: 5.1%\n\nSpirit Realty Capital (NYSE:SRC) is also a net lease REIT that has 255 tenants in over 1,600 properties. These properties span 48 states and their tenants represent 32 major industries.", "description": "Real estate investment trusts have been on a roll for a while now.
