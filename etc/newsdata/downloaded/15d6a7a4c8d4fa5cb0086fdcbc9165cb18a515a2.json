Many Americans have taken advantage of lower rates to buy a home, refinance or get a new car.\n\nExpectations for real, or inflation-adjusted, income gains rose the \u201cmost favorable level in two decades,\u201d said Richard Curtin, chief economist for the survey.\n\nA gauge that measures what consumers think about their own financial situation and the current health of the economy rose to 113.4 from 108.5, marking the highest level since the end of 2018.\n\nYet another measure that asks about expectations for the next six months barely rose, reflecting expectations of slower economic growth and a somewhat higher unemployment rate in the months ahead.\n\nRead: Low consumer inflation opens the door for Fed to cut interest rates further\n\nBig picture: The economy is still expanding at a moderate pace, but growth has slowed since the spring when sentiment nearly matched a 14-year high. The trade fight with China has been the biggest source of angst, contributing to a broad slowdown in the world economy that\u2019s hurt U.S. exporters and farmers and dampened business investment.\n\nThe darker hue to the economy has also made consumers somewhat more anxious despite a strong labor market and the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. Economists are watching closely to see if households cut back on a spending, which would be another warning sign.\n\nWhat they are saying?: \u201cOverall, the data indicate that consumption spending will be strong enough to offset weakness in business investment spending so as to keep the economy expanding into 2020,\u201d Curtin said. \u201cNonetheless, there are significant global and domestic uncertainties that will keep consumers cautious spenders.\u201d\n\nRead: U.S. adds 136,000 jobs in September and unemployment rate hits 50-year low\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.89% and S&P 500 SPX, +1.77% surged Friday on hopes of easing U.S.-China trade tensions. Senior Chinese officials are in Washington for a fresh round of negotiations.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +4.96% climbed to 1.73%, extending a recent upsurge fueled by hopes of a trade truce.", "description": "Americans in October showed the most optimism about the economy in three months, reflecting easing concerns about the trade war with China and little worry...", "authors": ["Jeffry Bartash"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT152_consum_ZG_20191011095239.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
