The trend continued with the abrupt departure in June of acting Secretary Pat Shanahan, a former Boeing executive who faced questions about domestic violence in his family, and brief reigns in the top Pentagon job, in acting capacities, by former Army Secretary Mark Esper and Navy Secretary Richard Spencer.\n\nSpencer was still acting defense secretary on July 18, on or about the date when Trump directed his staff to tell the Pentagon and the State Department to hold back the assistance for Ukraine, according to multiple news reports. A week later, when Trump held his now-disputed phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Esper had finally been confirmed by the Senate as the permanent defense chief \u2014 though just two days earlier.\n\n\u201cThese things make it harder for the system to work as it was intended to, for key national security officials to weigh in to make sure decisions being made really reflect our national security interests,\u201d said Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), who oversaw the military assistance program to Ukraine as a senior Pentagon official in the Obama administration.\n\nHaving not just one acting secretary but three in a row \u201cintroduces an element of complete uncertainty,\u201d Hagel added. \u201cDuring those times when Shanahan was in limbo, and then the questions over who would replace him, who would be the acting, for how long \u2014 you get this guessing game and it really hurts the department.\u201d\n\nDefense Department spokespeople didn\u2019t respond to requests for information about what directions the Pentagon received from the White House or its Office of Management and Budget in mid-July, or whether the order to freeze the aid even crossed Spencer\u2019s desk. The freeze affected the $250 million portion of the military aid package, which included funds for weapons like sniper rifles and launchers for rocket-propelled grenades, according to a June Pentagon statement, as well as night-vision gear, encrypted radios, and sensors to detect incoming artillery barrages and electronic warfare intrusions.\n\nThe assistance was the latest increment in a years-long effort to help the Ukrainian government combat Russian-backed separatists and deter Russian aggression. Congress stepped up military support to Ukraine with bipartisan legislation in 2014 after Russia annexed the country\u2019s Crimea region.\n\nThe Trump administration relented earlier this month, agreeing to release the new Ukraine money plus $140 million in security assistance through the State Department. But that happened only after Democrats had begun accusing Trump of using the money as leverage to push the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his family, an issue that this week led the House to start impeachment proceedings against the president.\n\nTrump has offered shifting explanations for withholding the money, saying either that he was concerned about corruption in Ukraine or wanted other European countries to contribute more assistance to Kiev. The White House\u2019s readout of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky doesn\u2019t explicitly mention the $390 million \u2014 although it says Trump, who requested help with a potential investigation of Biden, stressed that the U.S. has devoted \" a lot of effort and a lot of time\" to assisting Ukraine.\n\nSlotkin said the Ukrainians are in dire need of the military help.\n\n\u201cThey still have quite a hot war going in Ukraine \u2014 they\u2019ve lost 13,000 people \u2014 and when you withhold assistance or threaten to withhold assistance, that is a major pressure move.\u201d - Rep. Elissa Slotkin\n\n\u201cThey still have quite a hot war going in Ukraine \u2014 they\u2019ve lost 13,000 people \u2014 and when you withhold assistance or threaten to withhold assistance, that is a major pressure move,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s implicit or explicit, the result would be the same \u2014 the Ukrainian government is waiting with bated breath for that assistance. I know because when I worked on this, they would be calling us all the time checking on it.\u201d\n\nAfter Esper won confirmation July 23, the Pentagon weighed in with the White House in favor of continuing the Ukraine aid, but it wasn\u2019t until weeks later, in September, that the White House agreed to release the funds. So it\u2019s not clear that objections from an acting secretary at an earlier point would have made a difference, people familiar with the department\u2019s inner workings said \u2014 nor that placeholder Pentagon chief Spencer would have appreciated the significance of the freeze request.\n\nSpencer spent eight days as acting defense secretary while Esper awaited confirmation \u2014 and, coming from the Navy for such a brief stint, \u201cwould not have been deep in the Ukraine issue,\u201d said one former senior defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the possible implications of a decision he wasn\u2019t involved in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even clear that this directive would have percolated up to the SECDEF\u2019s office, but had it done so, I\u2019m not sure Spencer would have taken any particular note of it, because he would not have been fully read into Ukraine, or the timing of Zelensky taking office and speaking soon to Trump,\u201d the former official said.\n\n\u201cIt just wouldn\u2019t have rung a bell with him the way it would have with someone like Mattis,\u201d the former official suggested.\n\nEven the advice of permanent Pentagon leadership might not have swayed the White House on the Ukraine freeze, said the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Jack Reed of Rhode Island. Trump and his advisers \u201cweren\u2019t listening to military advice about this decision,\u201d Reed said. \"My sense is that this was not a diplomatic, strategic, military decision in any way, shape or form.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Rep.
