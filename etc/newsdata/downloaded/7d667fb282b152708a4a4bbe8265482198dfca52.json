That\u2019s the only way we can protect it from being sold off in a trade deal.\u201d\n\nDR Tony O\u2019Sullivan, co-chair of Keep Our NHS Public, said: \u201cThe NHS has faced six years of destructive top-down disorganisation.\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn/Daily Mirror)\n\n\"Legislation to return the NHS wholly to the care and responsibility of public service and ending privatisation is the only cast-iron defence against a Johnson-Trump deal.\n\n\u201cOnly this will guarantee for our children the future of the NHS as a public service for all.\u201d\n\nThe Mirror previously reported how The Office of the US Trade Representative published a summary of objectives for US-UK trade negotiations after Brexit .\n\nIt says US pharmaceutical firms want \u201cfull market access for US products\u201d.\n\nParliament recently voted against an amendment to the Queen\u2019s Speech proposed by Labour\u2019s Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth that sought to end NHS privatisation.\n\nThe amendment was supported by Labour, the Green Party, the SNP , Plaid Cymru and a number of Independents.\n\nThe Conservatives and the DUP voted against the amendment, along with a group of Independents, while the Liberal Democrats abstained.\n\nWe Own It and Keep Our NHS Public have launched a public campaign where constituents are asking their MPs and parliamentary candidates to sign a pledge committing to end NHS privatisation.\n\nNearly 900,000 people have signed a petition to keep the NHS out of any trade deals.\n\nA government spokesman said about the poll: \u201cThe NHS is not, and never will be, for sale to the private sector, whether overseas or domestic\u200e. The government is committed to the guiding principles of the NHS \u2013 that it is universal and free at the point of need.\n\n\u201cAs we leave the EU, the UK will continue to ensure that public services \u2013 including the NHS \u2013 are protected in all trade agreements it is party to, whether transitioned from an EU context or as a result of new negotiations.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Boris Johnson claims that the NHS is not \u201con the table\u201d, but only 31% believe him, compared to 45% who say he is lying and 24% who say they \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d", "authors": ["Rhian Lubin", "Emily Retter", "Image", "Pa", "Getty", "Pa Archive Pa Images", "Philip Coburn Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20735277.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Hospital.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
