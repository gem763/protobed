(Photo: Luis Falcon)\n\nOmar D\u2019Angelo smelled opportunity in the scent of frying empanadas. \u201cThe Mexican restaurants were growing, but there was not much diversity beyond that. In business you always want to do something unique and different, and as an Argentine person I knew I could bring something new,\u201d he says.\n\nHis Argentine food truck, Barroluco Argentine Comfort Food, hit the streets of Columbus, Ohio, in 2016 and has drawn a steady following for its empanadas (little meat pies) and its chimichurri (a kind of garlic pesto).\n\nWhether he realized it or not, D\u2019Angelo had tapped into a growing trend. In recent years, the U.S. has seen a rise not just in the number of Mexican restaurants, but also in the sheer diversity of Latino-inspired culinary options.\n\nThere were some 48,000 Mexican eateries nationwide in 2018, according to el Restaurante\u2019s Independent Mexican Restaurant Report, which tracks Mexican and Latin food trends through surveys and restaurant data. That\u2019s up 1,500 from the year before. Taco trucks are on the rise too, with 8,061 mobile Mexican eateries on the road in the U.S. this year, up from 5,500 in 2016.\n\nThe Latino trend extends beyond the usual tacos and burritos.\n\n\u201cOne of the hottest cuisines right now is Peruvian, with growth in casual dining, upscale dining and fine dining. Brazilian is seeing growth. El Salvadoran is becoming more popular,\u201d says Charles Chuman, vice president of sales for culinary research firm CHD Expert.\n\nWhy the boom? It\u2019s partly due to a rising number of Americans who hail from Latin America. Cities with large immigrant populations are seeing the fastest growth in dining options. \u201cPeople in cities like Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles are really open to new flavors and new tastes,\u201d Chuman says.\n\nAt the same time, staple Mexican items have become so commonplace that they no longer seem exotic. It\u2019s strange to think of ballpark nachos as \u201cethnic\u201d food. That opens the door for curious diners to experiment.\n\nPublic curiosity helped D\u2019Angelo get his truck rolling. \u201cAt first we had to explain everything,\u201d he says. \u201cNow people want us to succeed because they have come to like these flavors.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just independent operators like D\u2019Angelo who capitalize on rising interest. With more than 100 locations nationwide, burger chain BurgerFi this summer launched The Street Stack, a limited-time offering that sandwiches a beef patty between two arepas (griddle corn cakes) and tops it with charred jalape\u00f1o pico de gallo.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to create a new twist on a classic street food item that is synonymous with fun, summer and festivals,\u201d says Paul Griffin, BurgerFi\u2019s culinary director. \u201cAlthough arepas are considered a South American staple, sweet corn is widely loved by the masses, so we decided to have them act as our burger buns.\u201d\n\nThe quest for novel flavors isn\u2019t confined to lunch or dinner. Research firm Packaged Facts finds Mexican breakfast items have become twice as common on U.S. menus in the past decade: tasty dishes like migas (pan-fried corn tortillas, scrambled eggs, salsas, meats, and beans) and chilaquiles (fried tortilla strips softened in salsa, topped with poached eggs, cilantro, onions, crema and queso fresco).\n\nThese morning edibles \u201ctarget not just Hispanics, but all the ravenous millennials looking for what\u2019s next,\u201d the researchers note. As restaurants expand their menus to embrace other Latino flavors, their buying habits change, according to Dining Alliance, a group purchasing organization serving 18,000 restaurants. Its members saw purchases of staples such as refried beans, plantains, chipotle peppers and cilantro jump almost 35 percent from 2017 to 2018.\n\nUntil recently, restaurateurs might have had a challenging time securing these ingredients. Today, ready availability of Latino staples means consumers get to enjoy new menu choices.\n\n\u201cSystems have changed such that distributors are now able to bring in a broader variety of foods because of improvements in the supply chain and distribution technologies,\u201d Chuman says. As a result, \u201cwe are seeing a greater variety of products reaching a bigger audience.\u201d\n\nFor D\u2019Angelo, who came from Argentina to the U.S. with his family in 2000, a mobile dining venue offers the ideal means for introducing hungry neighbors to the flavors of his native land. \u201cThe food truck helps by spreading the interest,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing mobile, we can take these different flavors to people in lots of different places. We find that people are always interested in trying something new.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Angelo has been able to build upon that interest. In November, he leveraged the success of the food truck to fulfill a longtime dream, opening the 50-seat restaurant Barrolocu. \u201cI had always wanted to open a restaurant, but it was very expensive and difficult at first,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce we had some success with the food truck, the lenders had more confidence in me. Now we have a lunch rush from the nearby office spaces, so there is a steady business here, giving people something different from what they can usually find in Columbus.\u201d\n\nUSA TODAY Hispanic Living magazine (Photo: Investigation Discovery)\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2019/10/05/latino-inspired-food-choices-growing-united-states/3851649002/", "description": "Latin food trucks, restaurants and culinary products are popping up all over the country", "authors": ["Adam Stone", "Published A.M.
