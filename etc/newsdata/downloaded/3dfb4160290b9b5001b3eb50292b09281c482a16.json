Blockbuster draws rarely occur after Labor Day, which typically falls in the first week of September, unofficially marking the end of the summer driving season.\n\nU.S. Crude Inventories - 2018\n\nLast year, though, was phenomenally different for U.S. crude draws. In the week ended Aug. 17 (reported by the EIA on Aug. 22), there was a crude draw of 5.8 million barrels. Then in the following three weeks to Sept. 7 (reported on Sept .12 by the EIA), U.S. stockpiles continued to see large declines. The cumulative draw over the four weeks was of 18 million barrels.\n\nThis year, the same pattern occurred, though the draws were even larger.\n\nU.S. Crude Inventories - 2019\n\nIn the week to Aug. 18 (reported on Aug. 21 by the EIA), there was a crude draw of 2.7 million barrels. Then over the three weeks to Sept. 6 (reported by the EIA on Sept. 11), there were consecutive inventory drops. The four-week tally was 24.4 million barrels.\n\nSince then, there has only been one EIA dataset, showing a build 1.06 million barrels for the week ended Sept. 13.\n\nU.S. Crude Stockpiles Could Start Ticking Up From Here\n\nUnless the EIA\u2019s next numbers for the week ended Sept. 20, due at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT) on Wednesday, show a draw, it could mean stockpiles will be creeping up from here.\n\nSome analysts say they won\u2019t be surprised if the EIA reports another rise in crude stocks after the heavy rainfall in Texas last week that hit refinery activity. Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ), for instance, closed its 370,000 barrels-per-day refinery in the Texas city of Beaumont on Thursday due to flooding.\n\nA preliminary from the American Petroleum Institute (API) on Tuesday suggested that the EIA could report a sharp rise in stockpiles for the week ended Sept 20.\n\nThe API cited a crude build of 1.4 million barrels for the week, against a broader market consensus for a draw of 250,000 barrels.\n\nIn the previous week to Sept. 13, the API suggested a crude build of 592,000 barrels and the EIA ultimately reported a rise of 1.06 million.\n\nWhen comparing the API and EIA data, the directional trend is often what matters, as absolute numbers reported by the two entities vary dynamically because they are measured differently. The API collects industry data reported voluntarily by its members. The EIA is a government agency that mandates reporting by the entire U.S. energy sector.\n\nWhile the sure way of knowing the inventory numbers for each week will be to wait out the EIA release, a surprisingly accurate read might be obtained by just parsing its historical data.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com) covering: Exxon Mobil Corp, Crude Oil WTI Futures.
