(Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nFree TV, the peak body for free-to-air TV in Australia, has called upon the government to implement the recommendations of the ACCC\u2019s digital platforms report.\n\nA submission to Treasury demands that a code of conduct be implemented to regulate tech titans like Facebook and Google, which would dictate the terms of negotiation with Australian media companies.\n\nGoogle and Facebook have pushed back to varying degrees against the ACCC\u2019s recommendations, with Facebook arguing that they are \u201coutmoded\u201d and constitute undue interference.\n\nThe peak industry body for Australia\u2019s commercial free-to-air television networks, Free TV Australia, has demanded the government implement the recommendations of a recent ACCC inquiry into digital platforms \u2013 arguing it is now \u201ctime to act\u201d on industry disruption.\n\nIn a statement published to the organisation\u2019s website, Free TV boss Bridget Fair argues that the government must move quickly to counteract the \u201cgrowing dominance\u201d of digital platforms like Facebook and Google.\n\n\u201cWe are experiencing unprecedented disruption within the broadcast media industry because of the growing dominance of the largely unregulated digital platforms such as Google and Facebook,\u201d Fair said in the statement.\n\n\u201cWhile review processes around the world are revealing the problem, the Morrison Government has a chance to lead by implementing the solutions.\u201d\n\nFree TV Australia represents all of Australia\u2019s commercial free-to-air television broadcasters, including Nine Entertainment Co \u2013 the publisher of Business Insider Australia \u2013 Network Ten, and Seven West Media.\n\nIn addition, Free TV has made a submission to Treasury regarding the ACCC\u2019s recommendations \u2013 for the most part backing the proposals in the final report.\n\nIncluded in this submission are demands for measures which would tackle the dominance of global digital platforms in the local media market, including a general tightening of compliance regimes, reducing the \u201csignificant imbalance\u201d in negotiating power, and streamlining the process for removing illegal content.\n\nFree TV wants an enforceable code of conduct in place which would prevent tech companies from restricting the \u201creasonable and sustainable monetisation of Australian news and media content\u201d on their platforms.\n\nAlso in the crosshairs are local content quotas, which Free TV argues are \u201cnot sustainable\u201d \u2013 mostly because they do not apply to US-based digital competitors like Facebook, which are making significant moves into the in-house production and management of content.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the obligations and output of local content in Australia far exceed those in similar international territories,\u201d Free TV\u2019s submission reads.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that the expectations of Australian commercial television broadcasters are not set at a sustainable level and that we must seriously consider whether it is reasonable for this industry sector to continue to be regulated in this manner.\u201d\n\nThe submission acknowledges that there have been recent content deals between Facebook and local publishers, but says that such temporary arrangements do not constitute a long-term solution to the problem.\n\n\u201cHowever, it must be recognised that the recent limited content deals with Facebook do not address the long-term sustainable monetisation of premium Australian content on their platform,\u201d the submission says.\n\nThe statement comes amid pushback from the tech giants against the ACCC\u2019s final report.\n\nEarlier in September, Facebook issued a submission in response to the inquiry, arguing that it does not wield excessive power over Australian media companies, and that the recommendations were based on \u201coutmoded\u201d understandings of how digital platforms work.\n\n\u201cThe Final Report\u2019s analysis does not rest on a sound evidence base. It draws unfounded conclusions based on a selective and incomplete view of the spaces in which we compete, including subscribing to outmoded distinctions between different advertising services,\u201d Facebook said in its submission.\n\nFollowing Facebook\u2019s response, Google also flagged its opposition to some key measures of the ACCC report. In a blog post by local boss Mel Silva, Google took issue with two recommendations in particular: firstly, the suggestion that regulators directly intervene in the company\u2019s mobile operating system Android, and secondly the proposal for \u201cregulator-sanctioned\u201d revenue-sharing between platforms and publishers.\n\nThe Free TV Australia statement further confirms that the conversation about digital platforms regulation in Australia is only going to heat up further \u2013 even as US tech giants try to push back.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
