Among the votes against were two Republican senators (Rounds and Scott), who supported those who believe that it is the role of the federal government to subsidize big companies such as Boeing and GE.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s disappointing, because Garrett would have restored some accountability and transparency at the Bank while making sure that companies in countries that weren\u2019t allowed to be sponsored by U.S. taxpayers (think about Boeing selling planes to Iran) weren\u2019t getting Ex-Im loans. Make no mistake, a vote against Garrett signals the power of special interests, lobbyists, and the swamp over politicians, both Republicans and Democrats.\n\nRestoring the full lending authority of the bank is shameful. As a reminder, when Ex-Im was operating fully \u2014 before July 1, 2015 \u2014 65 percent of all its activities benefited just ten large companies and 86 percent of the deals were worth over $10 million. The Bank hasn\u2019t been able to back deals larger than $10 million since then, and yet, the sky is still way high above our heads, the dystopian world promised by the supporters of Ex-Im during the 2015 fight over the Bank never materialized, the economy is growing, and Boeing is flourishing. When are we going to hold accountable those who spent their time scaring the American people by telling them that things would be horrible if the Ex-Im Bank didn\u2019t continue business as usual? Apparently, never.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: With Garrett at the head of Ex-Im, things would have still returned to their normal level of redistribution from the non-subsidized businesses to the subsidized ones. But at least, there was a chance of accountability and restructuring to make the crony agency less distortive and less unfair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI assume that those who voted \u2018No\u2019 are hoping that they will get someone more flexible now that Garrett is out of the way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey may be wrong. First, Senators Toomey and Shelby, two true believers in the idea of draining the swamp, won\u2019t let them win so easily. According to Politico:\n\nThe administration has warned for months that if Garrett failed to advance then GOP lawmakers critical of the bank would hold up the confirmation of other nominees to head the agency. Sens. Pat Toomey (R-Penn.) and Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) have threatened to derail other Ex-Im appointees if Garrett were not cleared.\n\nThen, there is the matter of getting another nominee do better outside of the committee:\n\nIn an interview Friday, White House director of legislative affairs Marc Short declined to say what the administration would do if Garrett fell short of the necessary votes in committee. \u201cThere are some who look at it myopically and will say, \u2018Here\u2019s your challenge in committee,\u2019\u201d Short said. \u201cBut I think focusing on the committee in and of itself doesn\u2019t factor in other members of Congress who will oppose a different nominee.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetter yet, President Trump could show that he meant what he said about wanting to drain the swamp by not nominating anyone else for the job. Even better, he should withdraw his other candidates for the Ex-Im Bank in order to stand by Scott Garrett. Seriously, this would show the town that the swamp can\u2019t always win.\n\nI am disappointed to see that so many Republicans support cronyism. The worst part is that I fear they know better but would rather serve their narrow political interests than fight for the principles of a free market.\n\nAnd what about the Democrats? They are always fast to rail against big corporations. Well, what would result in more unfair government subsidies to the big and wealthy than the restoration of the Ex-Im Bank? But here they are wholeheartedly supporting corporate welfare for big companies.", "description": "I am disappointed to see that so many Republicans support cronyism.
