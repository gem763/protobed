Okay... I, Pete Buttigieg, politician, do henceforth and forthwith declare, most affirmatively and indubitably, unto the ages, that I do favor Medicare for All, as I do favor any measure that would help get all Americans covered. Now if you'll excuse me, potholes await. \u2014 Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) February 19, 2018\n\nButtigieg is pushing a different health care plan in the 2020 presidential election, which he calls \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It.\u201d He backs establishing a government-run health insurance alternative to the current private insurance industry, but he would allow the use of private insurance if individuals wanted to do it.\n\nThe plan has been a point of contrast with Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who support Medicare for All.\n\nIn the latest Democratic debate on Tuesday, Buttigieg said Warren's proposal doesn't \"explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole\" will be paid for.\n\nWarren responded: \"Whenever someone hears the term \u2018Medicare for All Who Want It,\u2019 understand what that really means. It's Medicare for all who can afford it. And that's the problem we've got.\"\n\nLater on, Buttigieg fired back that his plan is \"better than Medicare for all whether you want it or not.\"\n\nThe Buttigieg campaign highlighted his exchanges with other candidates on health care in emails to surrogates on Wednesday.\n\nButtigieg aides claimed there was no contradiction between the tweet and his current position, citing Buttigieg\u2019s support for a smooth transition to universal coverage.\n\nLis Smith, a top aide to Buttigieg, tweeted Wednesday afternoon that \"Pete's always supported making a public health insurance vehicle like Medicare available to all Americans in order to achieve universal health care. That's why he developed the most common sense plan for any Democrat in the race for president that would do just that.
