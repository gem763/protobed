First, it is not contemplating restating its audited financials.\n\nSecond, for the year to September 2019, it expects its consolidated earnings before interest, taxes and amortization, or EBITA, to be between R1.956bn and R2.056bn, within a range set out by PepsiCo in a previous joint circular. The US multinational had said Pioneer's consolidated EBITDA for the 12 months could not be 10% lower than R2.055bn.\n\n\n\nThe last condition \u2013 which also has to do with EBITA \u2013 cannot be calculated yet.\n\n\n\nThe acquisition has already been approved by the boards of both companies. Pioneer shareholder, meanwhile, will vote to proceed with the sale at the group's annual general meeting on Tuesday in Cape Town.\n\nIf shareholders pass the necessary resolutions on Tuesday, there are no court challenges and Pioneer fulfills all other conditions, the agreement will be finalised in the second week of February 20202.", "description": "PepsiCo is offering more than R24bn to buy Pioneer, the owner of brands including Liqui-Fruit, Weet-Bix and Ceres.", "authors": ["Jan Cronje"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7559/8f690ba9eb9748d798626f074bee77ae.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
