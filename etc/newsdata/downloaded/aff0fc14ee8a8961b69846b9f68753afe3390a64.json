He also is banned from participating in \u201cHearthstone\u201d esports for 12 months, until Oct. 5, 2020.\n\nThe action comes after Blitzchung (real name: Ng Wai Chung) appeared in an interview on the official \u201cHearthstone\u201d Taiwan stream. He pulled off his Hong Kong-protester-style mask and said, \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age!\u201d, according to esports news site InvenGlobal.\n\nNg said Blizzard\u2019s action will cost him $10,000 in prize money that he already won in the Grandmasters tournament, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBlizzard cited its tournament rule that prohibits players from \u201cEngaging in any act that, in Blizzard\u2019s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we stand by one\u2019s right to express individual thoughts and opinions, players and other participants that elect to participate in our esports competitions must abide by the official competition rules,\u201d Blizzard said in a statement.\n\nBlizzard is the most recent U.S. company to encounter a political controversy involving China and Hong Kong. China\u2019s state media and Tencent have suspended NBA broadcasts after Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey last week tweeted an image supporting the Hong Kong protesters. Morey has apologized for the tweet, which the NBA called \u201cregrettable.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cSouth Park\u201d creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone on Monday issued a satiric statement in the wake of reports that China has banned a recent episode critical of the government from online and social media services, saying, \u201cLike the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. We too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn\u2019t look just like Winnie the Pooh at all.\u201d\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
