The report says the church continues to receive allegations of abuse by clergy dating back decades.\n\nIt says priests abused nine children in the 1980s and at least 11 in the 1990s.\n\nIn a letter to Catholics on Wednesday, Denver Archbishop Samuel Aquila said he will do everything to ensure the widespread abuse doesn\u2019t happen again and that he will follow a series of recommendations by Troyer to enhance reporting and church accountability.\n\n\u201cI am sorry about this horrible history - but it is my promise to continue doing everything I can so it never happens again,\u201d Aquila said. \u201cMy sincere hope is that this report provides some small measure of justice and healing.\u201d\n\nThe investigation into the Denver, Colorado Springs and Pueblo dioceses could not rule out the possibility that clergy currently serving have been accused of sexually abusing children.\n\n\u201cArguably, the most urgent question asked of our work is this: Are there Colorado priests currently in ministry who have been credibly accused of sexually abusing children?\u201d the report said. \u201cThe direct answer is only partially satisfying: We know of none but we also know we cannot be positive there are none.\u201d\n\nTroyer was sharply critical of the church\u2019s response to abuse allegations, finding that the average time it took for a church restriction against a priest credibly accused of abuse was nearly 20 years.\n\nMore than half of victims were abused after church officials were made aware that priests involved were abusers.\n\n\u201cConcluding from this report that clergy child sex abuse is \u2018solved\u2019 is inaccurate and will only lead to complacency, which will in turn put more children at risk of sexual abuse,\u201d the report said.\n\nChurch officials opened files for the Colorado investigation. It was the latest in numerous investigations across the U.S. into the institution\u2019s sexual abuse crisis.\n\nWeiser has launched a reparations program that allows child abuse victims to apply for claims. It started accepting applications this month.\n\nThe document carries a warning that it \u201ccontains graphic and disturbing accounts of the sexual abuse of children.\u201d It names priests responsible, but does not include abuse of children by priests from other religious orders who worked in Catholic parishes.\n\nIt also does not address abuse of adults, including religious sisters or seminary students.\n\nThe report urges the Colorado church to hire independent investigators for abuse complaints; adopt electronic record-keeping and a complaint tracking system; hire an outside auditor to monitor continued church reporting; and hire victims\u2019 advocates.\n\nSexual abuse by Harold Robert White, a defrocked priest, have been known since shortly before his death in 2006. But Wednesday\u2019s report clarifies that White likely sexually abused at least 63 children throughout a 33-year career beginning in the 1960s.\n\nWhite took a \u201chealing\u201d sabbatical in 1981 before returning to work in at least seven more Colorado parishes.\n\nThe Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests issued a statement saying that it believes the numbers of Colorado abusers and victims are underreported - a possibility readily acknowledged by Troyer.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Colorado Public Radio, http://www.cpr.org/news\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "At least 166 Colorado children were sexually abused by 43 Roman Catholic priests over 70 years, and it took the church an average of nearly 20 years to act against clergy credibly accused of abuse, according to a report released Wednesday by Colorado's attorney general.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/church_abuse_colorado_46579_c0-190-5304-3284_s1200x700.jpg?ae9f9a11092665fb41a728a12ab41ac6c74af25b", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
