But what if a cocktail enthusiast wanted the heat built into the booze?\n\nThat is the thought behind Ghost Tequila, a brand that has surged in popularity since its introduction a few years ago. The \u201cghost\u201d is referring to the ghost pepper, which is among the spiciest varieties available. And the brand is the brainchild of Chris Moran, a onetime Boston bartender who got the idea from his experience in the cocktail world. Moran sourced what he calls a \u201ctop quality\u201d tequila from Mexico and then mixed it with a drop of ghost-pepper extract he developed on his own. He experimented with other peppers, but found the ghost worked best \u201cbecause you can use such a little bit of the pepper to add heat.\u201d\n\nThe tequila took off in the U.S. almost immediately, Moran adds, with volume growing at about 200% annually. He plans to soon introduce it in international markets. \u201cPeople love spicy everywhere,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat we think about it: We\u2019re fans of all things that tickle the tongue, but often find that flavored spirits have an artificial taste. Still, Ghost Tequila works for us: It\u2019s a clean, almost sweet-tasting tequila that has a nice kick at the end. So in spite of the ghost pepper\u2019s blistering reputation, the heat isn\u2019t overwhelming, though it\u2019s certainly there.\n\nHow to enjoy it: Yes, this makes a fine spicy margarita. But Moran suggests trying it in place of other spirits for a variety of cocktails \u2014 say, an Old Fashioned. It can also be sipped (more like downed) in shot form, though Moran offers the idea of mixing it with something even in a shot glass (he likes it with watermelon juice). No matter how it\u2019s served, the tequila could be a fun addition to a grown-up Halloween party \u2014 it\u2019s a \u201cghostly\u201d drink, after all.", "description": "The makers of the spirit add ghost peppers, one of the world\u2019s spiciest, for an extra kick.", "authors": ["Charles Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU009_ghostt_ZG_20191025092517.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
