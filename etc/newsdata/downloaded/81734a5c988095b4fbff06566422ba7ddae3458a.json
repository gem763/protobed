The photo was posted shortly after McGregor attacked a bus carrying UFC athletes, injuring people on board.\n\nWhen McGregor was conclusively beaten last year in October by his lightweight rival Khabib Nurmagomedov at UFC 229, 50 Cent was quick to mock the Irishman on Twitter.\n\nMcGregor is well aware of these memes, and he even said at a recent press conference in Moscow that they have made him want to fight the rapper in a celebrity bout \u2014 \"I'd like to fight him,\" McGregor said, according to Men's Health.\n\nMcGregor then said: \"He began a little tirade against me on social media, particularly Instagram where he'd make these memes about me constantly.\n\n\"Every time I'd go onto the internet I'd see 50 Cent had posted up some new stupid meme, and I wrote one of the memes \u2014 'Old man on the internet making memes,' and then he blocked me.\n\n\"So he's had to block me, and I still see sometimes, I still get tagged in \u2014 other people saying he's saying this and he's saying that.
