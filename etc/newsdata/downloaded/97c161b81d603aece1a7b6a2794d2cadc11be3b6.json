Now he is aiming to be music\u2019s answer to David Lynch\n\nSerge Pizzorno is looking back at the rise of his band Kasabian and trying to pinpoint when it all became a bit too much.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d turn up at shows and there\u2019d be 20-odd trucks there, a catering team, loads of people everywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you\u2019d think, wow, this is actually a job for a lot of people, and it all rests on these four maniacs!\u201d\n\nThis was in 2017: the band had just completed their sixth album, For Crying Out Loud, released to mixed reviews, and all was not well in camp. After 20 years together, Pizzorno was worried the band were getting stuck in a rut. And then there was the personal turmoil: not for songwriter Pizzorno, who had settled into family life in Leicester (he has two boys, Ennio and Lucio), but for Tom Meighan, the band\u2019s wild-eyed frontman.\n\nI worried we would get stale. Sometimes you need to go down the rabbit hole to refresh things\n\nMimicking their idols Noel and Liam Gallagher, Pizzorno wrote the songs while Meighan brought the stage presence, preposterous quotes (\u201cOur songs sound like we\u2019ve shit ourselves 10,000 feet in the air\u201d) and ludicrous tales. Band legend had it that, whenever Meighan became too much to handle, the other members had to take him to the nearest Toys R Us store to calm him down. But following a split from his partner, the relentlessly upbeat singer was struggling. He cried in one interview at the time.\n\n\u201cTom\u2019s still figuring things out, but he\u2019s in a much better place now,\u201d says Pizzorno when we meet for coffee in London. But it\u2019s no wonder they needed time out. \u201cI was worried we would get stale. Sometimes you need to go down the rabbit hole to refresh things.\u201d\n\nThe SLP is that rabbit hole. It\u2019s his initials \u2013 his full name is Sergio Lorenzo Pizzorno \u2013 and the name of his forthcoming solo album, recorded at his home studio, the Sergery (yes, really). With its guest appearances from Little Simz and Slowthai, and wild eclecticism, it\u2019s reminiscent of Gorillaz \u2013 a cartoonish world constructed as an escape from the pressures of being in an enormous band.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Ambitious in a minimal way\u2019 \u2026 the video for Nobody Else by the SLP\n\nPizzorno sees it less as a new direction and more a return to the way he started off making music. Back then he was using an old Atari and a Midi keyboard; these days he\u2019s been recording on his phone, stealing snippets from 70s Italian horror movies, \u201cweird Polish shit\u201d, and whatever grabs his attention when he\u2019s out and about.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be in Tokyo, hear the buzz of the electricity running through the pylons, and be like...\u201d he waves his phone in the air, as if frantically trying to record the sound. \u201cAll my mates will be taking the piss. And even in my own head I\u2019m thinking, \u2018I\u2019m never gonna use this.\u2019 But this time I did.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the buzzing pylons make it into The Wu, an incredibly odd song about wandering through hotel corridors in search of the afterparty. It\u2019s a case study in Pizzorno\u2019s esoteric influences, from the South African disco label Heads and Lee \u201cScratch\u201d Perry to the late Nigerian synth wizard William Onyeabor. Elsewhere there\u2019s Mediterranean house (Nobody Else), mariachi meltdowns (Meanwhile \u2026 in the Welcome Break) and, in ((trance)), the kind of joyously anthemic track that wouldn\u2019t sound out of place in, well, a Kasabian set.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pizzorno performing with Kasabian at the Royal Albert Hall in 2018.

Otherwise you become the band everyone expects you to be.\u201d\n\nThe irony is that Kasabian have never been the band a lot of people think they are anyway. When they emerged in the early 00s, with electro-influenced rock anthems such as Clubfoot and LSF, they were stereotyped as lairy lad rockers, when in reality they were just as enamoured by hip-hop and acid house.\n\n\u201cOn our first record I would wanna sit people down and go, \u2018No, no, no \u2013 this is where we were fishing for that stuff, Can and Neu! or whoever. But whatever we said, the journalist would just ask us about the Happy Mondays. I soon realised it was best to just keep your mouth shut, because if you\u2019re still able to make albums and art, who cares where it comes from anyway?\u201d\n\nI interviewed the band a few times back then and always found them far kinder and more erudite than they were portrayed (\u201cOn the road carnage with rock\u2019s rowdiest band!\u201d screamed one NME cover line). But it\u2019s fair to say, with their wild tales and boasts, they played up to it.\n\nWas the lad thing a bit of an act? \u201cWe knew that journalists wanted it,\u201d says Pizzorno. \u201cBut at the same time, we did grow up where, if you wanted to be in a band, you had to have your wits about you. If you\u2019re playing in a village pub in Leicester in front of a load of lads that would throw darts at your head for having long hair, you can either go in and be all art school, or you can snap a snooker cue in half and say, \u2018Let\u2019s go!\u2019 But then I still wanted to get them in the corner and talk about Jodorowsky afterwards.\u201d\n\nPizzorno\u2019s lad-rock credentials were no doubt enhanced by two televisual moments: a goal on Soccer AM, in which he improbably flicked the ball up in the air while wearing winklepickers before volleying it into a tiny hoop; and an even better strike during the Soccer Aid charity match that saw him scoop the ball over former England keeper David Seaman\u2019s head and into the top corner of the net. The mention of these acts of sporting glory makes Pizzorno groan: \u201cYou\u2019ll work for ages on a piece of music or art that you\u2019re really proud of. But kick a ball through a hole in an inflatable bouncy castle and it\u2019s what you become known for.\u201d\n\nCome on though, which was his favourite goal? \u201cWith the Soccer AM one I\u2019d been up all night, I was hanging. If I was sober I\u2019d never have even tried it. But the [Soccer Aid] one \u2026 not only is it a great goal, but for five minutes after scoring it, I\u2019ve never been more off my nut in my life. As a pure sledgehammer hit of adrenaline, it was insane. God knows what it would be like to score in a World Cup.\u201d\n\nLess impressive when it comes to lad stereotypes was a cover of Q magazine, on which Meighan and Pizzorno appeared alongside two naked ladies, something that even back in 2011 looked like a relic of a bygone era. Pizzorno groans again, but this time he means it. \u201cThat really kills me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was sold to us as Jimi Hendrix, Electric Ladyland, a celebration of 60s psychedelia. But we learned an important lesson there \u2013 we need to take control over every element.\u201d\n\nPizzorno says the band have always been more inclusive than people give them credit for. \u201cArt can be the start of something. At [Kasabian\u2019s] gigs you only have to look at the first few rows to see there\u2019s people from all over the world, with completely different views on how things should be done, but at least we\u2019ve got them together.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018It all rests on these four maniacs\u2019 \u2026 Kasabian (from left, Chris Edwards, Ian Matthews, Pizzorno and Tom Meighan) on tour in 2014. Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian\n\nThere\u2019s a song on The SLP that addresses this, the final track Meanwhile \u2026 in the Silent Nowhere. \u201cIt\u2019s about communication,\u201d says Pizzorno. \u201cPreviously, even if you were rightwing or had extreme views, it felt like there could be some sort of dialogue where you could at least hear each other\u2019s stories. Now it feels like, \u2018This is my belief, fuck you\u2019 ... there\u2019s a danger in us not sitting down and talking face to face.\u201d\n\nWhat does he think of the current political situation? \u201cIt\u2019s like Vegas. Fundamentally, the system is rigged and whatever you implement, the outcome will be the same. You\u2019re probably talking revolution here but we need someone to come along and start again.\u201d Is Jeremy Corbyn that person? \u201cHe\u2019s the best shot we\u2019ve got ... but I think there\u2019s more. There\u2019s someone else out there that can marry spirituality [with politics] and break the system and get us to start again somewhere better.\u201d He laughs: \u201cI think I\u2019m just waiting for the messiah.\u201d\n\nRight now, Pizzorno has more pressing problems than the overthrow of capitalism: how to be a musician without Meighan by his side. He\u2019s planned an impressive stage show, with different characters performing each song. It sounds ambitious. \u201cBut in a really minimal way,\u201d he stresses. \u201cNot overblown, the opposite to lasers and screens. It won\u2019t be pretentious. Pretentious is my number one fear.\u201d\n\nWill there be costume changes? \u201cVery subtle ones. There might be a hat. I might be barefoot. Fundamentally, I want it to be like a David Lynch thing, where people feel on edge, as if they\u2019ve entered another world for 50 minutes.\u201d\n\nPizzorno says he knows he can never compete with Kasabian\u2019s enormous gigs \u2013 those gigantic, truck-bearing affairs with catering teams and staff everywhere. \u201cBut the aim is to get to that same euphoric point,\u201d he says, \u201cjust in a whole new way.\u201d", "description": "He\u2019s the lairy lad rocker who scored one of the best ever goals on TV \u2013 in winklepickers.
