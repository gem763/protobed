Among men about 30 percent failed the exam and 84 percent of women failed\n\nThe most difficult part of the exam was the leg tuck event, which saw a staggering 72 percent of women fail\n\nArmy officials say that the data circulating online are not official documents from the Center for Initial Military training and all soldiers will be given two practice ACFT exams this year\n\nHowever, Army officials say that the data circulating online is not from official documents from the Center for Initial Military training.\n\n'The chart in question is not an official document and wasn\u2019t assessed or aggregated by CIMT to produce official results,' Lt. Col. Peggy Kageleiry, public affairs director for CIMT, said.\n\nThe data shared online was supposedly taken from slides used to bring the secretary of the Army and chief of staff.\n\nAccording to the data, overall about 36 percent of soldiers failed the rigorous exam. Men passed the exam at a rate of 70 percent and women passed with a mere 16 percent.\n\nThe most difficult part of the exam was the leg tuck event, which saw a staggering 72 percent of women fail. In some cases, women have been required to perform the move just six months after giving birth.\n\nIn the leg tuck event soldiers hang perpendicular to a pull-up bar and bring their knees up to their elbows and back down again for a repetition. The exercise is meant to test muscular strength, endurance and grip.\n\nThe ACFT exam is a big move for the army as it omits age and gender norms in testing. It test soldiers in six events that emphasize strength and endurance needed in combat\n\nThe new exam has been met with mixed responses for its revolutionary new standard of testing that omits age and gender norms in testing and consists of six events that emphasize strength and endurance that will be needed in combat.\n\nThe events measures muscular strength, muscular endurance, power, flexibility, coordination, speed, agility, cardiovascular endurance, balance and reaction time. The tests including lifting 120 to 420 pounds, throwing 10-pound medicine balls, sprints, leg tucks, and 20-minute two mile runs.\n\nThe Center of Initial Military Training says it's collecting data on the ACFT but it won't be released until it becomes the official test of record on October 1, 2020.\n\n'It is vital to emphasize that the first record ACFT is at least 13-14 months away,' Kageleiry said.\n\n'The Army will use this year to teach, train and mentor troops on how to prepare for the ACFT and therefore prepare for their combat mission. When training is complete and units have adapted to the new test, we expect performance rates to be similar to the current test,' she added.\n\nStarting in October 2019 the entire Army will take two practice ACFT tests about six months apart before it becomes the Army physical test of record in October 2020.\n\n'This larger, and force wide diagnostic phase will empower all Soldiers to further prepare and familiarize themselves with the ACFT,' Kageleiry said.", "description": "Leaked Army data reveals that men passed the new rigorous Army Combat Fitness Test exam at a rate of 70 percent, while women passed at just 16 percent, in testing of 11 battalions.", "authors": ["Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/21/19461728-0-image-a-62_1570568023195.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
