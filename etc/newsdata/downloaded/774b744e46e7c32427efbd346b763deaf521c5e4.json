Can Google actually be hit with anti-trust charges? We may be about to find out. Almost all of the state Attorneys General in the country have joined together to open up investigations into the tech giant\u2019s business dealings and determine if they\u2019re in violation of anti-trust laws. National Review has the details.\n\nAttorneys general representing 48 states, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, announced the opening of a sweeping anti-trust investigation into Google on Monday from the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court. Texas attorney general Ken Paxton, who will help lead the probe with eight fellow attorneys general, accused Google of \u201cdominat[ing] all aspects of advertising on the Internet and searching on the Internet,\u201d while announcing the broad investigation, the Washington Post reported. The probe will focus on whether Google\u2019s all encompassing business model unlawfully harms competition and consumers\u2026 Google is already facing anti-trust scrutiny at the federal level from Congress and the Department of Justice. In an investor filing released Friday, the company revealed that the DOJ filed a mandatory request for information as part of its broader anti-trust review of tech giants.\n\nThe only two states not participating are California (the home of Google, naturally) and, strangely, Alabama. Every other state, along with the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, is participating.\n\nI\u2019m automatically skeptical of anti-trust cases in almost all circumstances and this one is no different. I\u2019ll be the first to admit that Google is problematic on the best of days and they\u2019ve done plenty of things to justify having grievances against them. Their invasive abuse of user data and the well established liberal bias that permeates their corporate culture are enough to put many of us off our feed.\n\nBut are they a monopoly? I think that\u2019s going to be a very difficult case to make. Back in the day, you could see why Ma Bell could be tagged as a monopoly and broken up. They controlled virtually all of the equipment and underlying infrastructure for phone service. Competitors weren\u2019t allowed to use the gear and nobody could afford to duplicate all of the phone lines. A similar claim might be made against large cable television companies who own all the physical lines. More dodgy cases were brought against U.S. Steel and Standard Oil nearly a century ago, but they also had an iron lock on huge industries.\n\nBut what infrastructure does Google exercise exclusive control over? The internet? Nope. The web is the playground where they make their money, but they don\u2019t own the spine servers, cable television lines and cell towers people use to access their desired content. Whether it\u2019s Google\u2019s search engine, their email service, video sharing or any of the other thousands of products they offer, they have competition in every sector. There isn\u2019t one service of Google\u2019s that you can\u2019t find a replacement for in a matter of moments if you want to ditch them, and nearly all of them are free.\n\nSome will also argue that Google has acted as a monopoly by buying up so much of the competition and bringing it under their banner. But while that may seem unfair, we need to remember that nobody held a gun to the heads of those startup CEOs and made them sell They took the money and handed the keys over to Google willingly.\n\nThe fact is that if Google walks and quacks like a monopoly, it\u2019s because we made them into what they are. They got out on the playing field early and offered products that people wanted to use. They bought up other popular offerings and bundled them together. What\u2019s keeping them on top right now is momentum, and the same applies to the other tech giants like Facebook. This is particularly true in the social media era. Lots of people probably would like to walk away from services like YouTube or Instagram as a matter of principle. But that\u2019s where all your friends are. So most people stay. The same goes for Twitter, though I\u2019d far rather be using Gab.\n\nIf the government ends up trying to prosecute or break up Google they will be punishing them for being too successful, not for locking anyone else out. And as much as they may give us plenty to complain about, that\u2019s not something the government should be doing.", "description": "Good luck.
