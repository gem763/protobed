That Doesn\u2019t Mean ISIS Is.", "language": "en", "text": "President Trump notched a major counterterrorism victory Sunday when he revealed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, whom he called \u201cthe world\u2019s number one terrorist leader,\u201d had been killed in a raid by U.S. forces in northwest Syria.\n\nBut while Baghdadi\u2019s death is a serious blow to the terror group, as it tries to regroup after the loss of its territorial caliphate in Syria and Iraq, it's far from fatal, experts said.\n\nInstead, the movement had already decentralized itself to withstand the loss of any leader, and established a global network of largely independent terror franchises. Supporters, meanwhile, remain drawn to the group\u2019s enduring vision of a fundamentalist caliphate, rather than the personal appeal of any single individual, analysts told VICE News.\n\nREAD: Trump said Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi blew himself up \u201cwhimpering and crying\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople weren\u2019t really affiliating to ISIS because of Baghdadi\u2019s personality,\u201d said Shiraz Maher, director of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization at King's College London. \u201cThey were affiliating to ISIS because of the concept of the caliphate and this concept of a successful movement \u2014 building something that not even al Qaeda had achieved.\u201d\n\nWhile Baghdadi\u2019s death would hurt \u201cto an extent,\u201d the group\u2019s recent territorial losses and the capture of thousands of their fighters by Kurdish forces represented a more significant loss, said Maher. What\u2019s more, as demonstrated by al Qaeda, jihadi groups generally had the ability to endure despite the death of a figurehead.\n\nISIS had conscientiously built a movement designed to withstand the loss of any leader, with a decentralized structure that didn\u2019t rely on Baghdadi\u2019s day-to-day direction in Syria and Iraq, Ludovico Carlino, senior analyst at IHS Markit Country Risk, told VICE News.\n\n\u201cThey have built a very solid bureaucratic organization, so his killing is unlikely to have a big impact on the group\u2019s operational capabilities in Syria and Iraq,\u201d he said.\n\nThe terror group\u2019s fearsome reputation has allowed it to establish a global network of affiliates worldwide \u2014 from West Africa to Afghanistan to the Philippines \u2014 which also operated as insurgent movements independently of the central leadership in Syria and Iraq.\n\nCarlino said that while the network was not as strong as it used to be \u2014 with the Libyan chapter no longer controlling territory, and the loss of the territorial caliphate impacting the leadership\u2019s ability to set up new affiliates \u2014 supporters continue to pose a serious risk. In the past 12 months alone, ISIS has claimed responsibility for mass casualty attacks in Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, the Philippines, France, as well as others elsewhere.\n\nREAD: ISIS isn\u2019t dead. It\u2019s just moving to countries like Sri Lanka\n\nCarlino said Baghdadi\u2019s death was unlikely to affect ISIS\u2019 ability to exert an international reach in the short term, as \u201cthe loyalty of these affiliates is towards the group and the idea, not the individual.\u201d\n\nHowever, there was a risk for ISIS that it could lose this hold if its standing in the jihadi world fell further \u2014 something that could happen unless a compelling successor to Baghdadi emerged, Lina Khatib, head of the Middle East and North Africa program at the Chatham House think tank, told VICE News.\n\n\u201cIf this figurehead does not emerge in the near future, it may be they evolve away from the central ISIS brand,\u201d she said.\n\nMaher said Baghdadi, who claimed he could trace his lineage back to the Prophet Muhammad, had a flair for powerful propaganda.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a tactical strategic genius,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he did achieve powerful theater \u2014 whether that was the theater of himself standing in the mosque in Mosul declaring the caliphate, or the theater of the very grisly executions.\u201d\n\nWhile analysts say ISIS will almost certainly have had a succession plan in place, for now, the identity of the next leader of the world\u2019s most infamous terror group remains unknown. One man tipped as a potential successor, ISIS spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, was killed in a separate raid early Sunday.\n\nWith the group already in transition and fighting to consolidate after the loss of its caliphate, the question of who takes the reins next will likely be crucial to its global survival, said Khatib.\n\n\u201cThe global affiliates all benefited hugely from the brand of ISIS as this so-called caliphate. It helped them get legitimacy, instill fear, attract supporters and funding,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it loses this intimidating image, the killing of Baghdadi may prove to be another huge loss for what remains of the group.\u201d\n\nCover: In this July 17, 2017, file photo, a fighter of the Christian Syriac militia that battles Islamic State group militants under the banner of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, burns an IS flag on the front line on the western side of Raqqa, northeast Syria.
