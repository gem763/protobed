However, having identified the root causes of our operational issues, we have made substantial progress over the last few months in resolving them,\" he said, adding: \"There remains lots of work to be done to get the business back on track.\"\n\nPre-tax profits tumbled 68% to \u00a333miliion in the year to August, while revenues ticked up 13% to \u00a32.7billion.\n\n\"The UK market has been more promotionally intense over the last year and our approach throughout the year has evolved to respond in a more agile and demand led way, whilst not losing sight of profitability,\" a market announcement said.\n\nIt said in the early part of the year, new customer acquisition and traffic were disappointing - reflecting poor trading over Black Friday, with the retailer admitting its offers \"looked uncompetitive\" over last year's sales period.\n\n(Image: Bloomberg)\n\nIt said during this period, it experienced \"a loss of focus on product and customer engagement\".\n\nHowever bosses insisted it's on track for transformation with trials of new 2-hour flash sales and discounted Next Day Delivery mechanics, which have so far \"resonated well with our UK customers\".\n\nIt comes just months after the retail behemoth announced a crack down on 'serial returners' - with plans to ban those who exploit the system .\n\nThis year saw the launch of concession Collusion - which has received almost 2million searches online with over 150,000 items sold.\n\nActivewear sales also surpassed expectations with the retailer promising \"significant growth plans in place for next season\".\n\nA new Snow & Ski range is due to launch later this year.\n\n\"Our focus now turns to ensuring we have the right mix of product available in each of our warehouses, with the right brands, newness and width of product available for each market,\" the company concluded.\n\nThis year, Asos also launched new payment methods for customers including Afterpay in Australia and New Zealand, Yandex in Russia and a Klarna powered 'Pay-in-4' solution in the US.\n\nIt now plans to roll out paperless returns in the UK - which uses a mobile QR code rather than a customer returns label, and hopes to take the entire process 100% paperless.\n\nThe retailer's total active customer base is now 20 million - with 81.9% of visits now coming via mobile.", "description": "Restructuring costs and operational problems have seen profits fall at the online retailer - but it says it's now on a transformation mission", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Pa", "Bloomberg"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18984829.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Asos-warehouse-damaged-by-fire.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
