The apartments rent for $701 per month, which Parr said is half of what a one-bedroom would cost on campus.\n\nThe apartments are part of The Exchange, a new building built on top of the new bus terminus in the centre of campus, and is part of the university's ongoing efforts to keep up with housing demands.\n\nThe Exchange is UBC's newest residence. It has room for up to 651 students.
