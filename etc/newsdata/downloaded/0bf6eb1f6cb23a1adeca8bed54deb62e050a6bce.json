Bush", "language": "en", "text": "Elton John said he admires Ellen DeGeneres for standing up for civility and defending her friendship with former President George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cI admire Ellen for standing up and saying what she said,\u201d the pop icon told NPR in an interview published Sunday.\n\nMs. DeGeneres was criticized last week by the left and the LGBTQ community after she was photographed sitting next to and being friendly with Mr. Bush. The TV host later defended her friendship with the former president and reaffirmed her commitment to \u201cbe kind\u201d to others.\n\n\u201cJust because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not going to be friends with them,\u201d Ms. DeGeneres said on her show. \u201cWhen I say, \u2018Be kind to one another,\u2019 I don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone. Doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nMr. John said he agreed that people need to do a better job in accepting other people\u2019s views.\n\n\u201cGeorge Bush has made a lot of mistakes. I made a lot of mistakes. Ellen DeGeneres has made a lot of mistakes,\u201d the singer said. \u201cPeople need to come together. \u2026 They need to respect people\u2019s view on life. Except when it\u2019s heresy, and I don\u2019t think George Bush is that kind of guy.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
