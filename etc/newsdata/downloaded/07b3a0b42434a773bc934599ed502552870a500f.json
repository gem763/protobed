When the Court ruled in the 2008 Heller case that the Second Amendment protected a fundamental right, it was clear that this right belongs to everyone, not just the residents of an individual state. The Seventh Circuit held in Moore v. Madigan that the carrying of firearms in public for self-defense is a fundamental right, but under existing Illinois restrictions, that right has been limited to Illinois residents and citizens from only four other states.\n\nOn December 11, 2012, Breitbart News reported the Seventh Circuit ruling that brought concealed carry to Illinois.\n\nJudge Richard Posner wrote the court\u2019s Majority Opinion, saying:\n\nWe are disinclined to engage in another round of historical analysis to determine whether eighteenth-century America understood the Second Amendment to include a right to bear guns outside the home. The Supreme Court has decided that the amendment confers a right to bear arms for self-defense, which is as important outside the home as inside.\n\nSAF\u2019s pursuit of a SCOTUS review is joined by the Illinois State Rifle Association (ISRA), Illinois Carry, and nine private citizens.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
