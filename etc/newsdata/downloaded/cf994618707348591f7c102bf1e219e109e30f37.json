The images and analysis showed injuries to their lungs resembling toxic chemical burns.\n\nDr Brandon Larsen, a surgical pathologist at Mayo Clinic Arizona and a lead author of the study, said the researchers saw \u201ca severe chemical injury\u201d much different from what doctors see in tobacco or marijuana smokers. Larsen said: \u201cI think we\u2019ve only seen the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "Eighteen people have died in 15 states, with Alaska and New Hampshire the only states yet to report cases", "authors": ["Amanda Holpuch"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3e8409092303ed3c3f1610ee6691cf80dbf296b/2_92_2230_1338/master/2230.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cf19b178ae826fc2edaa5cefe86db9da"}
