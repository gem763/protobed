Then in August, the junior coalition partner withdrew its support. For some in the Romanian opposition, the only way out of this crisis is a snap general elections.\n\nDan Barna, a presidential candidate with the Save Romania Union party, said: \u201cA vote of no confidence is absolutely necessary because we as a country cannot afford to be led by an incompetent and inept government that misses every instance of proper administration.\u201d\n\nBut Valeriu Steriu, a social-democrat MP thinks the vote is unlikely to pass: \u201cIf the motion passes, we\u2019ll be in full presidential elections mode. Luckily, I\u2019m convinced it won\u2019t (pass) because the are many responsible opposition MPs conscious of the possible risks for our economy.\u201d\n\nBut for many people in the country, this latest showdown is yet another sign that politicians are out of touch with Romanian society. Education and healthcare, for instance, are in shambles, but nobody seems to address that.\n\nPolitical analyst Andrei Taranu told Euronews: \u201cWe are in a structural crisis, one that politicians are incapable to deal with. Therefore they\u2019re putting forward some small crises that are easy to solve relatively quickly, without dealing with the painful issues in need of solving.\u201d\n\nKit Gillet, a journalist based in Romania, thinks this time around the vote is going to be very close:\n\n\u201cMore than half of parliamentarians in the Senate did vote last week to have this motion, so if all of those were to vote yes, then it would pass,\u201d Gillet said.\n\n\u201cBut the government has been very busy in this last week or so, trying to persuade some of the opposition to vote in favour of the government\u2026 The vote is likely to be very close, it\u2019s going to be a couple of votes either way and at the moment the opposition is confident that they have the numbers.\u201d\n\nWatch Good Morning Europe\u2019s report in the player above.", "description": "The move comes just a month before the country's presidential election.", "authors": ["Joao Vitor Da Silva Marques"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/16/24/1000x563_cmsv2_bc0eae7b-1f24-54ff-b7d4-49f5b2828887-4221624.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
