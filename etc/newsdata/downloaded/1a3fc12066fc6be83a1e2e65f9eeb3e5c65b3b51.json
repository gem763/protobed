That\u2019s not a question we should be asking.", "language": "en", "text": "Let\u2019s be clear. If impeachment is what\u2019s causing the stock market\u2019s volatile performance, Trump\u2019s news conference Thursday morning would have set off further careening. After all, the Democrats are pushing for impeachment because Trump asked the Ukraine to illegally intervene in a U.S. election. He has now asked China to do the same. \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens,\u201d he said at a press gaggle on the White House lawn. That statement came, as Post reporter David Nakamura pointed out on Twitter, a moment after Trump said, in reference to trade talks with China set to resume Monday, \u201cIf they don\u2019t do what we want, we have tremendous power.\u201d\n\nThe Dow Jones, which was down by more than 100 points when Trump began speaking, suddenly headed upward. Trump potentially doubled his trouble, and the stock market went up. Apparently Wall Street was more concerned about trade with China than the fate of American democracy, not to mention Trump\u2019s fate, one way or the other.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut there\u2019s a bigger point here: The stock market is not a moral lodestone. If anything, it\u2019s the opposite. Discussion of the stock market should play no role in the impeachment process \u2014 and it should play less of a role in any discussion of what\u2019s good for the country.\n\nThat, in some ways, is a foreign concept to us. One reason we\u2019ve had a hard time calling out Trump\u2019s stock market talk for the moral abomination it is: We\u2019ve confused the health of the stock market with our health as a nation for decades. Beginning in the 1980s, much of the popular culture joined Wall Street analysts in cheering companies that announced cutbacks because of the associated stock price rises, even though those cutbacks meant thousands of people lost their jobs. More recently, this view permitted Wall Street to cozy up to Trump, taking the corporate tax cut like pigs at a trough, with no thought given to the long-term consequences. It\u2019s a mindset. Nothing is more important than making sure the people who own the stocks get their short-term returns!\n\nBut that\u2019s a major reason we\u2019re in the political mess we are currently in. Trump is the logical endgame of this way of thinking. He\u2019s got what can only be described as a deeply personal relationship with the American government: He believes its main purpose is to serve him. From the day he ascended office, he confused his own best economic and political interests with those of Americans. He\u2019s quick to talk up the stock market when the going is good, but either goes silent or looks to blame when it goes down. He all but put an open-for-business sign on the White House. Even his bullying of the Federal Reserve in hopes of more interest rate cuts is at least somewhat self-interested: Yes, the global economy is showing signs of a slowdown, but Trump would save millions of dollars in real estate loan payments if the rate came down.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo of course Trump\u2019s going to conflate the fate of the stock market with his own personal fate. But the rest of us shouldn\u2019t enable that. It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s inaccurate. It\u2019s not just that a corrupt president looking out for his own and his family\u2019s financial and political interests is going to hurt us all in the long run. It\u2019s that even if he\u2019s right, he\u2019s wrong. We\u2019re not so far gone as a nation that we\u2019ll prioritize a short-term 401(k) movement over our democratic institutions. At least I hope we\u2019re not.\n\nAD", "description": "Discussion of the stock market should play less of a role in any discussion of what\u2019s good for the country.", "authors": ["Helaine Olen", "Opinion Writer Focusing On Politics", "Economics", "American Life", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/p_IfG_LRgtKKGdydyjt8fWYSxxg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VWO6GGXFKQI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
