Particularly following the 20th anniversary of the club\u2019s fabled treble winning triumph in 1999.\n\nThe club\u2019s start to this season, though, has taken some Old Trafford regulars back to a time they would rather forget, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s faltering, shot-shy side currently emulated the bungling pre-title drought winning team of 1989/90.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThis is now officially United\u2019s worst start to season for 30 years, although they can at least boast of having two more points than the seven mustered by Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s side who started to the season with a 4-1 win over then champions Arsenal, before stuttering more badly than Paul Pogba\u2019s penalty run-up.\n\nEnglish football, of course, was a very different place back then but there are some undeniable similarities between that United vintage and the team that is currently languishing in ninth in the Premier League following a similarly dismal start to their campaign.\n\n\u201cWe always started the season thinking we could win the league, you have don\u2019t you?\u201d says Clayton Blackmore, the former United favourite who spent 12 years as a player at Old Trafford.\n\n\u201cThe pitch didn\u2019t really help back then. It was a really bad pitch to play on. We wanted to play football, we tried to play football but the pitch evened everything up. Look at the pitches now, there\u2019s no comparison.\n\n\u201cThe fans were very quick to get on our back. They had worked all week, turned up on a Saturday and they wanted to be entertained. They took their frustrations out on us.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a huge amount of money around. A million was a big fee back then but we hadn\u2019t spent a lot of money. We had Mark Hughes up front and players like Brian McClair and Bryan Robson.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cYou look through that team and there was an awful lot of talent there. That season we just didn\u2019t make the most of it. I suppose you could say the same for the current lot now.\u201d\n\nMike Phelan is challenged by Tottenham's Mitchell Thomas (Getty)\n\nThrow in Gary Pallister, Steve Bruce, Paul Ince and Lee Sharpe and the side Blackmore was a part of wasn\u2019t that far removed from the one that would win the title for the first time since 1967, just three years later.\n\nWhat the club didn\u2019t have then was the kind of winning mentality that would sustain it for the best part of 20 years once that first Premier League title was won.\n\nBack-to-back defeats against Derby, Norwich and Everton, punctured the optimism generated by the club\u2019s opening day mauling of the Gunners, which followed the arrival of Michael Knighton on the scene at Old Trafford. And although a 5-1 drubbing of Millwall ended that run of three successive losses, worse, much worse, was to follow.\n\n\u201cIt was like climbing a glass mountain,\u201d said Ferguson, after watching his slipshod defence concede five as Manchester City ran riot in the derby at Maine Road. Chants of \u201ceasy\u201d reverberated around the terraces as Pallister \u2013 then the most expensive player in the league \u2013 and Bruce were led a merry dance that left most disgruntled United fans heading for the exit long before the final whistle.\n\nFerguson said it was the worst defensive performance he had witnessed in all his years of management and, believe it or not now, left him clinging to his job. September 1989, like September 2019, is not a month that any United fan enjoys revisiting. It\u2019s one that David Oldfield, who scored a brace for City in that match, though, is far happier to talk about it.\n\n\u201cManchester City were full of really promising, really talented young footballers,\u201d he says. \u201cUnited had more experienced players, they were obviously a strong team, but Sir Alex was under pressure at the time and City seemed to be a side most definitely on the up.\n\n\u201cLiverpool were so strong and dominant at that stage but then vanished. And United were the same in the late 80s. They seemed way off challenging for the title. It\u2019s a testimony to Sir Alex that he eventually turned it around so quickly.\u201d\n\nAfter that match at Maine Road it was hard to see how things could get worse, yet they recovered to win the FA Cup at Wembley in May \u2013 which should give Solskjaer some crumbs of comfort as he desperately seeks to find a solution to the club\u2019s current woes.\n\nAlex Ferguson directs from the touchline (Getty)\n\nBlackmore was just one of a fine crop of United youngsters that had come through the ranks at Old Trafford in 1982 \u2013 a decade before the players who would eventually come to define the most glorious era in the club\u2019s history won the FA Youth Cup.\n\nAnd he\u2019s still confident that those emerging from the academy now will ensure that the 26 year wait for the title, endured so painfully back then, won\u2019t be repeated.\n\n\u201cWe have got some really good talent in the kids,\u201d says Blackmore, who worked at United\u2019s academy for eight years between 2010 and 2018. \u201cMason Greenwood is one of the best I\u2019ve worked with. He\u2019s the natural talent, he didn\u2019t need to practice finishing because he was naturally good at it. Free-kicks, penalties, he should be taking everything.\n\n\u201cMy problem is that they\u2019re young lads and they need direction. When Ryan Giggs came into the team he had a team of men playing with him. It\u2019s easier when you\u2019ve got a team of experienced players. Who does Marcus Rashford learn off? Who does Greenwood learn from?\n\nRead more\n\nSolskjaer\u2019s blame of referees cannot mask United\u2019s lack of imagination\n\n\u201cWe were constantly reminded back then that we had to win the league. It had been 26 years and when we did win it, it was a bit weird, it was just a major relief. It was a strange feeling.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a DNA at the club, and if you watch a video of how we won all those games, you\u2019ll see it. It\u2019s no great mystery as to how we won all those trophies. We\u2019ve had some fantastic players like Ronaldo at the club but the players also worked incredibly hard. As it stands, we need a new strikers, probably two. Bringing (Zlatan) Ibrahimovic back would be a good start.\u201d\n\nThat would certainly go down well with the fans who have been transported back to a time they would rather forget. Whether even he can lift the current fog of misery, though, remains to be seen.\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Solskjaer\u2019s blame of referees cannot mask United\u2019s lack of imagination\n\nSolskjaer\u2019s words of optimism ring hollow after latest stumble\n\n5 things we learned from AZ Alkmaar vs Manchester United", "description": "You could forgive Manchester United supporters for feeling more than a little nostalgic in recent years.
