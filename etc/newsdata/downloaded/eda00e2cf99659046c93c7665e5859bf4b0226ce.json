It serves mankind and nature,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2013 Forced into secrecy \u2013\n\nZoroastrianism was founded in ancient Iran some 3,500 years ago, gaining followers as far afield as India.\n\nIt was the official religion of the powerful Persian empire for a thousand years, but the assassination of the final Zoroastrian king in 650 and the rise of Islam sent it into a long demise.\n\nHowever the faith did survive \u2014 often in the face of severe persecution \u2014 and famous followers include Freddie Mercury, whose Zoroastrian family were originally from Gujarat in western India.\n\n\u201cDuring (late dictator) Saddam Hussein\u2019s rule, my father practiced Zoroastrianism but kept it secret from the state, our neighbours and relatives,\u201d said Awat Tayib, who represents the faith at the regional government\u2019s ministry of religious affairs.\n\nIn 2014, IS jihadists captured swathes of northern Iraq, carrying out what may have constituted a genocide against another minority, the Yazidis.\n\nThe extremists imposed a violent version of Islamic law and sparking a three-year war that eventually left their self-proclaimed \u201ccaliphate\u201d in tatters and the region in ruins.\n\n\u201cMany think IS values are very odd in contrast with Kurdish values and traditions, so some have decided to abandon their faith,\u201d high priest Qadrok said, adding that he performs ceremonies every week to welcome new converts.\n\nThe religion only gained official recognition by regional authorities in 2015, but since then, three new temples have opened \u2014 although Tayib said the state has yet to build a cemetery for followers of the religion.\n\nFor some in the autonomous region, which overwhelmingly voted for independence in a 2017 referendum bid, turning to Zoroastrianism is a way for a stateless people to assert regional identity in defiance of Baghdad.\n\nTayib, the only female religious representative in the autonomous government, said Kurdish society is becoming more tolerant towards Zoroastrians.\n\nAFP accompanied the high priest and his assistants to Islamic Friday prayers organised to condemn a Turkish military incursion into Kurdish parts of northern Syria.\n\nAs the Zoroastrian religious men arrived, they were surrounded by Muslims welcoming them and asking for selfies.\n\nIslam is still by far the main religion in the Iraqi Kurdistan, while there are no official figures on Zoroastrians.\n\n\u201cThe Zoroastrians are our brothers, not our enemies: our enemies are the ones who are killing us, such as (Turkish President Recep Tayyip) Erdogan,\u201d said Islamic cleric Mullah Saman, who welcomed the Zoroastrians.\n\nAzad Saeed Mohammad, the head of Yasna, a body which promotes Zoroastrianism in Kurdistan, said Kurds \u201cneed to have their own religion just like other nations in the Middle East in order to save themselves from aggression and invaders\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe need to use our ancient religion to revive our identity and build the nation,\u201d he said.", "description": "Darbandikhan (Iraq) (AFP) \u2013 In a ceremony at an ancient, ruined temple in northern Iraq, Faiza Fuad joined a growing number of Kurds who are leaving", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
