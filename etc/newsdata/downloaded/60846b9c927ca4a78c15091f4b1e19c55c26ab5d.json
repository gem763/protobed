REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis/Files\n\nThis adds to the challenges facing Narendra Modi as he begins his second term as prime minister with India\u2019s economy at its weakest levels in six years.\n\n\u201cThe slowdown in credit growth this time is a result of both reduced demand and supply,\u201d Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at CARE ratings, said.\n\n(Graphic: INDIA BANK CREDIT here)\n\nLending growth by banks had nearly halved to 8.8% at the end-September from the start of the year.\n\nThe RBI data includes all banks in India, which is dominated by state-run lenders Bank of Baroda (BOB.NS), Punjab National Bank (PNBK.NS) and Union Bank of India (UNBK.NS) as well as private ones such as HDFC Bank (HDBK.NS) and ICICI Bank (ICBK.NS).\n\n(Graphic: SECTORAL CREDIT DEPLOYMENT here)\n\nWhile retail lending has driven growth, banks are taking a more cautious approach on some consumer loans.\n\n\u201cIn certain retail loans we\u2019re seeing customers delaying the payments by a few days over the due date,\u201d said the head of consumer banking segment of a private bank, adding that this does not bode well when corporate lending has plunged.\n\nA report last month by India Ratings predicts \u201cfurther moderation\u201d retail lending in 2020 \u201cgiven the consumption slowdown across segments including housing and auto\u201d.\n\n\u201cEven the unsecured loans, which include credit cards, education loans and other personal loans have seen a moderation in growth,\u201d the report said.\n\nIndia\u2019s lending problems have been compounded by a drying up of liquidity in the shadow banking sector last year after the collapse of infrastructure lending group IL&FS.\n\nWhile some major non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) have been going slow on lending, others stopped completely.\n\nHowever, banks have not used this opportunity to win market share from NBFCs, which accounted for 30% of auto loans and more than 40% of home loans until the end of last year.\n\n(Graphic: INDIA REPO VS SBI here)\n\nThe weak growth in lending comes at a time when banks have been cutting interest rates and making it cheaper to borrow.\n\nSo far in 2019, the RBI has reduced the repo rate by 135 basis points. Even though banks have not matched this, the pace of cuts has picked up in the last few months.\n\n(Graphic: INDIA CREDIT-DEPOSIT RATIO here)\n\nA high credit-deposit ratio has been one of the key reasons why banks have struggled to cut interest rates. But with credit growth falling faster than deposit growth, banks may have a bit more room to transmit rate cuts.\n\nA credit-deposit ratio above 75% indicates pressure on banks\u2019 resources as they have to set aside funds to maintain a cash reserve ratio of 4% and a statutory liquidity ratio of 18.5%.\n\nIn an attempt to push banks to pass rate cuts on to their customers, the RBI has required them to link all loans to an external benchmark such as the repo rate since the start of this month. While this is expected to push rates down, economists are not sure this will help spur credit demand.\n\n\u201cCredit growth is expected to remain sub 10%,\u201d Sabnavis said.", "description": "Credit growth at Indian banks has dropped to its lowest level in nearly two years, the latest Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data shows, as slowing domestic consumption weighs on demand.", "authors": ["Nupur Anand", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441424331&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0P1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
