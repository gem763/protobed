The largest cryptocurrency dropped to US$7,305 on Wednesday, the lowest in five months. Alt coins also rallied, with Ether jumping 12 per cent, Litcoin gaining 14 per cent and Zcash increasing 11 per cent.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\n\"Though today's jump is notable, it should be noted that this recovery is to the same level Bitcoin was trading before the recent pullback and puts BTC right back in a range where it traded for a nearly month until this week,\" Mr Dorman said Friday.\n\nStay updated with\n\nBT newsletters Terms & conditions Sign up\n\nCryptocurrencies may also get a boost after China's state-owned news agency Xinhua reported the country plans to speed up development of blockchain technology and industry, citing President Xi Jinping. The government will strengthen the study of blockchain standardisation and increase investment in the sector, the report said.\n\nBitcoin dipped this week after Facebook chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg testified before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. The proceedings highlighted the extent of the US government's hostility toward the company's Libra cryptocurrency initiative.\n\nPotentially adding to concern was the news that Alphabet Inc's Google has built a computer that's reached \"quantum supremacy\", performing a computation in 200 seconds that would take the fastest supercomputers about 10,000 years. Skeptics of cryptocurrencies have noted that advances in computing could make the slower proof of work system used by Bitcoin and other tokens obsolete.\n\nTwitter Inc chief executive officer Jack Dorsey weighed in with a tweet that could be interpreted as vote of confidence for Bitcoin: a screenshot with \"buy\" and \"sell\" buttons, the latter blotted out.\n\nBLOOMBERG", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Technology - [PORTLAND] Bitcoin (BTC) surged 15 per cent, recovering from its lowest levels since May, amid a general risk-on rally in financial markets. .
