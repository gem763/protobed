She also took time to defend 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden, and his son Hunter, who've also been caught up in the Ukraine scandal.\n\n\"We hate to do this, really, but the president isn't telling the truth,\" Wallace interrupted. \"These allegations against Joe Biden and Hunter Biden that he\u2019s repeating have been investigated by the Ukrainians... What\u2019s amazing is that what Trump appears to be trying to do, is to turn his own impeachment into a big deflection.\"\n\nJIM JORDAN: PELOSI DECIDED ON IMPEACHMENT BEFORE SHE EVEN READ THE UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT\n\nKurtz said MSNBC should have waited for the president to finish before criticizing him and then played a clip of Wallace interrupting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who took over the mic after Trump.\n\n\"Her factual point was correct,\" Kurtz said. \"But, couldn't the former Bush White House aide have waited until at least the president had his say before unloading on him? MSNBC then went back to the presser and when Trump yielded the floor to Mike Pompeo, Wallace broke in again.\"\n\n\"Whatever is coming out of the White House is not coming from the president, because what he\u2019s disseminating are lies, attacks, and deflections, \" Wallace butted in.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKurtz claimed he had little issue with Wallace's actual point, but said the network needed to work harder to present a fair and nonpartisan front, rather than allowing the media mask to slip completely.\n\n\"Remember this is daytime news coverage by a news network,\" he said. \"I don\u2019t care if Nicolle Wallace wants to attack Trump every single day. She's an opinion person. But, at this press conference, there wasn\u2019t even the pretense of fairness by MSNBC.\"", "description": "\"Media Buzz\" host Howard Kurtz\u00a0criticized rival network\u00a0MSNBC for its coverage of President Trump Sunday and singled out host Nicolle Wallace\u00a0for talking over the president's speech and calling him a liar while it streamed live on air last week.", "authors": ["Nick Givas", "Nick Givas Is A Reporter With Fox News.
