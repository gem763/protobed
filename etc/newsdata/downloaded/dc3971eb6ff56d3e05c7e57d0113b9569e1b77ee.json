In the West, representations of Asian women in popular culture are often relegated to the same limiting roles: the ultra-feminine, innocent and sexually submissive \u201clotus blossom,\u201d the model minority and the sexually aggressive, domineering \u201cdragon lady,\u201d to name a few. One trope used time and time again is the Asiatic prostitute, where Asian women are often depicted in Western narratives as sex workers or sex slaves.\n\nPerhaps one of the most memorable scenes featuring an Asian sex worker in a contemporary Hollywood film is from Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d (1987), in which a Vietnamese prostitute solicits two American GIs by telling them, \u201cMe so horny ... me love you long time.\u201d The film\u2019s depictions of the Vietnamese sex workers offer nothing of their personalities, histories or inner lives, only that they are women with degenerate values and bodies to be exploited by the men.\n\nThe idea that all Asian women are prostitutes hasn\u2019t come solely from stereotypes in Western media; it was also perpetuated by U.S. immigration law. The Page Act of 1875, the first law to restrict immigration into the country, effectively halted the immigration of East Asian women (namely Chinese women) to the U.S., under the assumption that they were all prostitutes and undesirable immigrants.\n\n\u201cSuch legalized exclusion of Chinese women popularized American representations of them as degrading figures that could potentially debase white manhood and, as such, threaten the health of the United States\u2019 social body as a modern nation and imperial power,\u201d Lily Wong, an associate professor at American University, wrote in \u201cTranspacific Attachments,\u201d which studies the shifting depiction of Chinese and Chinese American sex workers in transpacific popular media. \u201cThe legalized policing of Chinese female bodies justified both anti-Chinese \u2018yellow peril\u2019 discourse and U.S. civilizing rescue narratives of imperial expansion into Asia.\u201d\n\nIt is unsurprising, then, that a lion\u2019s share of the most popular on-screen and onstage productions starring Asian actresses fed into this exact discourse of the Western white savior going to the East and being seduced by an Asian woman. Both \u201cThe World of Suzie Wong\u201d (1960) and Claude-Michel Sch\u00f6nberg and Alain Boublil\u2019s hit musical \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d feature Asian sex workers as female leads, both of whom play the role of a \u201chooker with a heart of gold\u201d while simultaneously embodying the lotus blossom stereotype.\n\n\u201cThe World of Suzie Wong\u201d stars Cantonese-European actress Nancy Kwan in the title role. In the film, Suzie Wong, a Hong Kong prostitute, becomes the love interest to American architect Robert Lomax. Film scholar Celine Parre\u00f1as Shimizu wrote about Suzie in her book \u201cThe Hypersexuality of Race\u201d: \u201cDespite incredible hardship as an illiterate prostitute with an illegitimate son, she maintains her goodness, beauty, and innocence.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe embodies immoral practices while projecting an innate innocence,\u201d Shimizu wrote, so it is only ever Suzie, the lotus blossom, who was exploited by men. In \u201cHustlers,\u201d while Destiny maintains some of her innocence by labeling Ramona as the ringleader, she and the rest of her stripper posse flip the script by exploiting their white male clients (by drugging them and stealing their money). Meanwhile, Suzie is the picture of subservience, promising her dedication to Robert by saying, \u201cI will follow you until you say, \u2018Suzie, go away,\u2019\u201d and asking him in another scene, \u201cRobert, why you not let me be your permanent girlfriend?\u201d\n\nSuzie was forced into the sex trade after being abandoned at 10 years old. Her character is a mirror to Kim, the female lead in \u201cMiss Saigon,\u201d a 17-year-old Vietnamese bargirl who also exemplifies the prostitute with a heart of gold archetype. Kim falls in love with and marries a U.S. Marine who leaves once the war is over, and she waits for his return for three years \u2014 with their love child. When they reunite, the man is with his new American wife, whom Kim meets, triggering her to ultimately kill herself. The musical has long been protested by Asian American activists for its racist, sexist and Orientalist depictions, as well as for yellowface controversies.\n\nThese more contemporary stories are spawned from earlier texts, which all replicated the same repeated tropes. \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d is actually based on Giacomo Puccini\u2019s 1904 opera \u201cMadama Butterfly,\u201d which instead followed the doomed romance between an American lieutenant and a Japanese geisha. Before that, \u201cMadama Butterfly\u201d was inspired by \u201cMadame Chrysanth\u00e8me,\u201d an 1887 semi-autobiographical novel about naval officer Pierre Loti\u2019s temporary marriage to a Japanese woman named Kiku. These recurrent storylines perpetuate the image of the Asian woman as war brides, geishas and prostitutes, all of whom lack agency and live to serve the white male lead. Meanwhile, Destiny\u2019s purpose in life seems much more layered: to find a sense of belonging, to take care of her family, to chase thrills, to succeed in life. And we can tell that aspects of her job excite her, exhaust her and bore her at the same time.\n\nHowever, in \u201cMiss Saigon,\u201d when the non-lead prostitute characters were allowed to display their inner lives on stage, audiences view them as desperate and suffering.\n\n\u201cThe production of \u2018Miss Saigon\u2019 may actually represent other \u2018particular women in the sex industry\u2019 beyond those enmeshed within conditions of sexual slavery,\u201d Shimizu wrote. \u201cWhile sexual slavery indeed exists for Asian female prostitutes, other situations coexist simultaneously in ways that should not be removed.\u201d\n\nHowever, thanks to persistent stereotypes like those deployed in Suzie and Kim\u2019s characters, Asian sex workers, especially those who are migrants, are often assumed to be trafficking victims.\n\nHollywood\u2019s insistence on stereotyping Asian women as helpless, innocent lotus blossoms has been met with inevitable consequences, like the fetishization of Asian women, and even some unintended ones, like a hammer-wielding man who killed Chinese men to \u201cprotect\u201d Chinese women from them after watching an unspecified movie.\n\nWhile Wu\u2019s character in \u201cHustlers\u201d is leaps and bounds better than the characters that came before, presenting a more nuanced and dimensional portrayal of an Asian sex worker on screen, there are still ways in which she fits into the same lineage as Suzie, Kim and Madame Butterfly.\n\n\u201cDestiny still maintains a bit of the Asian American ingenue innocence as Ramona\u2019s protege,\u201d Kate Zen, co-founder of Red Canary Song, an organization that advocates for the rights of migrant sex workers, said in an interview. \u201cShe ultimately caved in interrogation and sold out the group to the police, in a way that might arguably be retaining the model minority myth.\u201d\n\nSex workers had many other criticisms of the film, from maintaining \u201cthe whorearchy\u201d by portraying the Russian dancers who were willing to give blow jobs as lesser than to ignoring the fact that strippers are often the victims of crimes rather than the perpetrators.\n\n\u201cThe dimensionality is positive,\u201d Zen said, \u201cthough the focus on drugging and robbing customers also perpetuates stigma against sex workers and is a bit of an aberration from the reality of stripping, where strippers are more likely to get drugged by customers than the other way around.\u201d\n\nBrooke, a 20-year-old former stripper from the Chicago area, pointed out that while \u201cHustlers\u201d does some work to destigmatize the sex trade, she wishes it would\u2019ve shed more of a light on the abuses and racialized harassment endured by Asian sex workers.\n\n\u201cI was told on my first night that being Asian equals money, but they fail to tell you how many times you\u2019ll hear, \u2018I\u2019ve never fucked an Oriental girl,\u2019\u201d Brooke, who requested to not use her last name in regard for her privacy, told HuffPost in an interview. \u201cI had many people excited just to see an Asian dancing, thought I was naturally into certain things like being dominated and bossed around, and also treated like a disgrace by Asian men who came into the club.\u201d\n\nStill, in \u201cHustlers,\u201d audiences are treated to a more well-rounded portrayal of an Asian stripper, whose complex inner life is revealed to us on-screen \u2014 one that we nearly missed out on, given Dakota Johnson was initially considered for the lead role. (Though perhaps a Southeast Asian actress would\u2019ve been even better casting, considering the real life stripper Destiny was based off of is Rosalyn Keo, who is Cambodian.)\n\nUltimately, the portrayal of Asian sex workers on screen has come a long way since the \u201cme so horny\u201d streetwalker, which is especially important given the inextricable ties between the treatment of Asian women in real life and our on-screen depictions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so positive for us to see ourselves portrayed at all,\u201d Zen said. \u201cWhat a breath of fresh air!\u201d", "description": "Female leads in \"Miss Saigon\" and \"The World of Suzie Wong\" embodied the Western stereotypes of Asian women.", "authors": ["On Assignment For Huffpost"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8e480d1e00005800749831.jpeg?cache=gdyedyyvb9&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
