Her testimony had been scheduled for Friday, but was moved to Wednesday.\n\nCongressional investigators want to ask Cooper, who oversees Ukraine policy, about why the administration withheld military aid at a time when Trump was urging Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nBill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, told lawmakers Tuesday about the potential linkage between the aid and investigations.\n\nRep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., told reporters that Taylor's testimony was a \"sea change\" that could \"accelerate\" the impeachment process.\n\nCooper's appearance isn't certain. Last week, Defense Secretary Mark Esper notified congressional chairmen that he would not cooperate with a subpoena for documents from the Defense Department. The White House has vowed not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry, and has called it a \"partisan\" effort and a \"coup.\"\n\nBut the State Department also directed Taylor not to testify, and he appeared under subpoena.", "description": "Congressional investigators want to\u00a0ask Laura Cooper, who oversees Ukraine policy at the Pentagon, about the withholding of military aid to Ukraine.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/22/USAT/1bb74739-5281-4030-a415-706128b213eb-laura_cooper.JPG?crop=719,959,x0,y0&width=719&height=897&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
