Given Trump\u2019s threats over what could happen to whoever it is, calls have been made to disguise both their face and voice. \u201cAll they really need to do is disguise the whistleblower as Trump\u2019s daughter Tiffany and he\u2019d be like, \u2018Who is this person? I\u2019ve never seen her before in my life,\u2019\u201d Noah joked.\n\nStephen Colbert: \u2018Tragically, he\u2019s developed phone spurs\u2019\n\nOn The Late Show, Stephen Colbert spoke about the difficult position Trump has found himself in. \u201cHalf of Congress absolutely hates him, and the Democrats aren\u2019t fond of him either,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s refusal to participate in the impeachment inquiry led Colbert to joke that \u201ctragically he has developed phone spurs\u201d, before he spoke about the \u201cofficially bitchy eight-page letter\u201d released by the White House and the \u201cabsolutely bonkers arguments\u201d within it.\n\nTrump joked that he wouldn\u2019t trust the kangaroo court that is in front of him and Colbert disputed this by saying: \u201cThere\u2019s no koala bailiff, no dingo judge.\u201d\n\nSeth Meyers: \u2018It\u2019s an impeachment inquiry, not Secret Santa\u2019\n\nOn Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host also spoke about Trump\u2019s refusal to cooperate. \u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re not participating? It\u2019s an impeachment inquiry, not Secret Santa,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to choose whether you participate! You\u2019re like a guy being dragged away in handcuffs screaming, \u2018I\u2019m not participating in this arrest!\u2019\u201d\n\nA poll has revealed that 58% of Americans support the opening of an impeachment inquiry, which led Meyers to quip: \u201cCongratulations, man! You\u2019re finally polling over 50%.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also been shown that 60% of women support the inquiry. \u201cWell, \u2018Thank God, they can\u2019t vote,\u2019 said Mike Pence,\u201d Meyers said.\n\nA recent report included a quote from an official who claimed that Trump has gone rogue. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, he went rogue?\u201d Meyers said. \u201cHe\u2019s always been rogue. It\u2019s like saying Oscar the Grouch went to the garbage. He lives in the garbage.\u201d\n\nJimmy Kimmel: \u2018I have three words for that: you go first\u2019\n\nOn Jimmy Kimmel Live! the host also brought up the text conversation and the words \u201ccall me\u201d. He said: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound fishy at all.\u201d\n\nHe also joked: \u201cIn this administration, if you know anything, you know too much.\u201d\n\nKimmel also didn\u2019t hold back on Trump\u2019s behaviour this week and those around him. \u201cHow dumb is this guy?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd these jackholes who keep rallying about him are so desperate to defend something they know nothing about, and they\u2019re doing it by discrediting the very House of Representatives that they\u2019re in!\u201d\n\nTrump has also suggested staffers take a lie-detector test after fears over more whistleblowers emerging. \u201cI have three words for that: you go first,\u201d Kimmel joked.\n\nGiven the president\u2019s history of lies, he also found it a bizarre suggestion. \u201cThis is like pooping your pants and walking around saying, \u2018Someone in here stinks,\u2019\u201d he said.", "description": "Late-night hosts discussed the White House\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e216a43679680bfb7f512628ce9a0ed2d900cac/112_0_1432_859/master/1432.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=219d8776675ce9eb2a4a5ccae2c71c9e", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
