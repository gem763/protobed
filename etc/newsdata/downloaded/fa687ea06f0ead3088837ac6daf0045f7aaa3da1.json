One representative answered that the map was too small, to which the student replied that the map did include the island of Hainan south of China, which is similar in size to Taiwan. Another representative interjected that Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China together form \u201cGreat China.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s apology to China drew condemnation from Taiwanese officials.\n\n\u201c@Dior\u2018s apology to the PRC government is a mistake,\u201d Taiwanese foreign minister Joseph Wu shot back on Twitter. \u201cIts employee was correct in showing the Chinese map without #Taiwan.\u201d\n\nThe controversy comes after the NBA was accused of buckling to Chinese censorship in a similar spat earlier this month.\n\nOn October 4, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted, \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d The Chinese Basketball Association immediately moved to cut all ties with the Rockets, and Chinese streaming service Tencent announced that it would not show any Rockets games for the coming year. Morey subsequently released a statement apologizing to Chinese fans, and the NBA publicly condemned Morey for his tweet supporting the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The NBA faced widespread condemnation from U.S. elected officials, who blasted what they called its weak response to China\u2019s demands.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Luxury brand Christian Dior apologized on Thursday for showing students a map of China that didn't include Taiwan in a closed-door recruiting session at Zhejiang Gongshang University in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou.\"Dior first extends our deep apologies for the incorrect statement and", "authors": ["Zachary Evans"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OWRPFes0Nb2gFwfn8NiYQw--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/dddc528058014117f3b05cc4d7db4464", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
