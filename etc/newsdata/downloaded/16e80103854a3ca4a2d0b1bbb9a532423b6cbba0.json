You can imagine the scale of the challenge,\u201d said Greece\u2019s alternate minister for migration, Giorgios Koumoutsakos.\n\nGreece, Bulgaria and Cyprus delivered a joint statement at the meeting calling attention to the eastern Mediterranean route.\n\nIt said: \u201cGeopolitical factors, including conflicts in the broader area particularly in Syria, entail that we will most likely see a continuation of this alarming trend in the short to medium term.\u201d\n\nTurkey has said its preparations for a military operation in northern Syria against Kurdish fighters it views as \u201cterrorists\u201d is complete, and it has deployed armoured vehicles to the border.\n\nIts path into northeast Syria was cleared by US President Donald Trump on Monday ordering American troops out of that zone because of Turkey\u2019s intentions.\n\nOfficials in the EU said that if Turkey does invade part of Syria, many of the four million refugees Turkey is hosting \u2014 most of them Syrians \u2014 may decide to head to Europe to avoid being forcibly pushed back into their unstable homeland.\n\n\u201cI hope there won\u2019t be an operation,\u201d Luxembourg\u2019s foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, told reporters.\n\n\u201cBut imagine that you\u2019re a refugee in Turkey, you\u2019re Syrian \u2014 the risk exists that you might be transported one day\u2026 into northeast Syria. That\u2019s a factor that could generate a wave towards Europe,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked about that scenario in a media conference, the EU\u2019s commissioner for migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos, said \u201cthe European Union remains committed to the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Syrian state\u201d.\n\nThe EU, he added, urged \u201cthe cessation of hostilities, the protection of civilians and unhindered, safe and sustainable humanitarian access to all of Syria\u201d.\n\nThe EU Security Commissioner Julian King was asked about Trump\u2019s criticism that European countries had \u201crefused\u201d US demands to take back their citizens who had fought for the Islamic State group and were now being held in northeast Syria.\n\nHe replied that the issue was \u201ca matter for national authorities, and they guard that jealously\u201d.\n\nHe noted that EU agencies stood ready to help gather and process evidence of alleged crimes committed by the ex-fighters should they ever be repatriated to face trial.", "description": "Luxembourg (AFP) \u2013 EU officials discussing migration Tuesday expressed concerns that a threat by Turkey to send its troops into northeast Syria", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/2662f1_migrants-child-helped-by-rescuers-arrive-on-greek-island-lesbos-crossing-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
