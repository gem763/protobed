Then go to Settings > Display & Brightness. At the top under Appearance is the option to choose Dark Mode. You can select this to have Dark Mode on all of the time or choose Automatic so Dark Mode only switches on at night.\n\nAfter just two hours into the experiment, the Dark Mode iPhone was on 88 percent and Light Mode handset had dropped to 83 percent.\n\nAt four hours, Dark Mode was on 72 percent while Light Mode had just 57 percent.\n\nThe Light Mode iPhone went dead at seven hours and 33 minutes, while the Dark Mode phone still had 30 percent left in its battery.\n\nHowever, the YouTubers noted that results may vary, as battery life will depend on how bright the screen is set, the iPhone model and other factors.\n\nIt is said that Dark Mode is most effective on devices with OLED screens.\n\nThis includes the iPhone X, iPhone XS and iPhone Pro.\n\nThe Light Mode iPhone went dead at seven hours and 33 minutes, while the Dark Mode phone still had 30 percent left in its battery\n\nThe Dark Mode feature is part of Apple\u2019s iOS 13 release that hit iPhone last month.\n\nApple had previously teased that iOS 13 would give the iPhone 'a whole new look' and it will not disappoint with its new Dark Mode feature, which allows users to switch on a version of iOS that's colored black and grey.\n\nThis version is much easier on the eyes when a user is browsing their phone at night.\n\nAt four hours, Dark Mode was on 72 percent while Light Mode had just 57 percent\n\nIn order to activate Dark Mode, first make sure you are using the latest iOS 13 operating system.\n\nThen go to Settings > Display & Brightness.\n\nAt the top under Appearance is the option to choose Dark Mode.\n\nYou can select this to have Dark Mode on all of the time or choose Automatic so Dark Mode only switches on at night.\n\nFor those who cannot afford one of Apple's new iPhones, the firm is set to release a smartphone that is much cheaper -- but packed with the latest technology.\n\nIt is claimed that the \u2018spiritual iPhone SE successor\u2019 will have a 4.7-inch screen, Finger ID and be available in 'the first quarter of 2020'.\n\nThe new SE could be the Cupertino company\u2019s way to appeal to those who want the iOS features, but do not want to pay the hefty price tag for the recently released smartphone.\n\nHowever, Apple is designing the smartphone to look more like the iPhone 8, which has the finger ID and smaller display.", "description": "An experiment had robot arms test an iPhone XS while in Light Mode and Dark Mode.
