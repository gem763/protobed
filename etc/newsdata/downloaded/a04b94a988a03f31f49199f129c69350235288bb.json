He backs the impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats last month, but he faults House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for resisting a formal vote to start the process. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be done with all these committees running around,\u201d Kasich told me. \u201cThere ought to be some rules.\u201d\n\nOur conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nRussell Berman: Your book is a call for bottom-up activism, and for people to focus on their local communities. Have you given up on Washington?\n\nJohn Kasich: Great change\u2014social change, political change\u2014doesn\u2019t come from the top down. It comes from the citizens up to the top, not the other way around. So am I giving up on Washington? No, but I think we need to realize that we as people are in charge of what ultimately happens in this country\u2014and not just in political dimensions. Social change comes from people who work in their communities to live a life a little bigger than themselves and to connect with others.\n\nRead: John Kasich searches for his place in the GOP\n\nBerman: Many if not all of the people you quote for inspiration at the beginning of chapters or cite as positive examples are associated, in one way or another, with the political left. What does that say about the Republican Party and its support, or lack thereof, for activism? Where are the examples of Republican or conservative inspiration?\n\nKasich: I could have quoted Ronald Reagan. I just didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think that bottom-up [activism] is a monopoly of liberals. If you look at Teddy Roosevelt\u2014I guess I could have quoted him\u2014there\u2019s a guy who was as bottom-up and as populist as anybody you can think of in the 20th century. Some just jump out at you, or what they had to say fit the chapter. But look, I\u2019m disappointed with my Republican Party right now, and the fact that it\u2019s become too negative. But I\u2019m also not happy with the hard-left positions of those that want to build bigger governments and more bureaucracies.\n\nBerman: You\u2019ve said that you didn\u2019t vote for Trump in 2016. You don\u2019t intend to vote for him next year. So of the Democrats who are running, are there any who\u2014\n\nKasich: I didn\u2019t say I was voting for them either.\n\nBerman: But of those running, are there any you could see yourself supporting?\n\nKasich: I\u2019m not going to get into who I\u2019m going to support in the Democrat primary. Let\u2019s let it all work itself out, and then I can tell you.\n\nBerman: Who do you think was a better president: Barack Obama or Donald Trump?\n\nKasich: [Laughs] I\u2019m not getting into that. This book is not about that. This book is about bottom-up [activism]. Comparing Obama and Trump\u2014you\u2019re not going to get me into a trick box here. I\u2019m not going down that rabbit hole, sorry.\n\nBerman: Based on what you\u2019ve seen and read so far, where does Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian leader rank among the things that he has done that concern you?", "description": "The former Ohio governor won\u2019t vote for Donald Trump next year.
