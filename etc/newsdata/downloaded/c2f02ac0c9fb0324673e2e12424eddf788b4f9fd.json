This is a much higher rate than is normally expected.\n\nAs well as Greece, countries such as Serbia, Romania, Italy and Cyprus have also seen infection rates soar.\n\nThere has not yet been a human case in Britain, although James Logan, head of the Department of Disease Control at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said this was a surprise.\n\n\u201cIt is still a bit of a mystery as to why West Nile virus has not come to the UK; the conditions are certainly conducive\u201d, he told The Lancet health journal last year.\n\nDr Brown agreed, saying: \u201cThe mosquitos are increasingly available and I think it is a strong possibility that West Nile will become more prominent further north in Europe.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why we would not [have it in the UK]. We have seen other mosquito-borne viruses spread north \u2013 the rising temperatures mean the mosquitos can survive longer.\u201d\n\nThe virus can take hold anywhere birds, which are its main carrier, migrate to. This includes the UK, where it is believed to have been present in the avian population since at least 2003.\n\nThere is no vaccine for the West Nile virus and health authorities\u2019 only recommendation to protect against it is to wear long clothing and use insect repellent to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.\n\n\u201cThere is still a bit of a mindset that mosquito-borne diseases tend to be a tropical issue \u2013 actually they are coming much closer to home these days,\u201d Prof Logan cautioned.", "description": "The West Nile virus has been found in Germany for the first time, after years of a warming climate that scientists believe encouraged the mosquitoes which carry the deadly disease to move further north.
