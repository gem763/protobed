While YouTube says the feature was rolled out to combat \u201cmisinformation,\u201d it nonetheless raises questions about how the platform chooses which stories to serve up to viewers, at the expense of other content.\n\nIt's called the \"Top News Shelf\" and it was announced 15 months ago:https://t.co/j5it4kiBs8\n\n\n\nhttps://t.co/HNLsDvFkQKpic.twitter.com/kgtvCpvOqv \u2014 Tim Pool's Grifter Beanie (@NeotericLefty) October 22, 2019\n\nLike this story?
