The future of the imperial family for coming generations rests instead on the shoulders of his nephew, 13-year-old Hisahito, who is second in line for the throne after his father, Prince Akishino.\n\nNaruhito's grandfather, Hirohito, in whose name Japanese troops fought World War Two, was treated as a god but renounced his divine status after Japan's defeat in 1945. Emperors now have no political authority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough many Japanese welcomed the enthronement ceremony, some shrugged it off as a nuisance.\n\n\"There is no need for such an elaborate ceremony. Traffic has been restricted and it is causing inconvenience for ordinary people,\" said Yoshikazu Arai, 74, a retired surgeon.\n\n\"The emperor is necessary now as a symbol of the people, but at some point, the emperor will no longer be necessary. Things will be just fine without an emperor.\"\n\nReuters", "description": "Emperor Naruhito formally proclaimed his ascendancy to the throne in a centuries-old ceremony attended by dignitaries from more than 180 countries, pledging to fulfil his duty as a symbol of the state.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3974%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_479%2C$y_379/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f63603b481f3bf8940591077a14aac27c7df2c2c", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
