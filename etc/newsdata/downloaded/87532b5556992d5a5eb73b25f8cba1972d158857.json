It also made major league history.\n\nIn an unprecedented season for home runs across baseball, Villar\u2019s 443-foot blast off left-hander Caleb Ferguson was the 6,106th home run in the majors this season, breaking a record set in 2017.\n\nIt seems where home runs are concerned, the Orioles are always in the thick of them. En route to their major league record 280 home runs allowed (and counting), the Orioles also allowed the most home runs in a season before May 1.\n\nIn a season in which the Orioles\u2019 pitching staff often has left Manager Brandon Hyde in the dugout looking like a man who really hoped his car would start but isn\u2019t surprised it didn\u2019t, Means has little to be worried about.\n\nIf anyone on this team has won over the coaching staff in Year 1 of what will assuredly be a long rebuild, it\u2019s the self-starting left-hander who spent the offseason refashioning himself into a major league pitcher and almost all of this season proving himself to be a good one.\n\nJust look at Wednesday\u2019s effort, which combined with home runs by Villar and Pedro Severino ended the Orioles\u2019 six-game losing streak and helped the club match their 2018 win total at 47-98.", "description": "Infielder\u2019s blast \u2014 the 6,106th home run in the majors this season \u2014 broke the mark set in 2017 and lifted starter John Means and the Orioles to a 7-3 win over the Dodgers.", "authors": ["Jon Meoli", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ELF3neyXspD68rfE4j5Z3sWgQcg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LPWFFVGVEAI6TBVMB4SQZSIXLA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
