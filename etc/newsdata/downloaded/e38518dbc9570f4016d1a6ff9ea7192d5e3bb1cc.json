Ted Cruz Tuesday afternoon. Milano has brought along Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime was shot and killed in Parkland, and he didn\u2019t promise to be all smiles:\n\n@tedcruz, I will be seeing you later today. Let's discuss this further. What you call rage, I call justified anger over your refusal to deal with gun violence. When we meet, I will definitely lighten up and smile for you. https://t.co/O2lAvzqciz \u2014 Fred Guttenberg (@fred_guttenberg) September 10, 2019\n\nShould we give Cruz credit for meeting with Milano over gun violence or is he wasting his time?\n\nWhat a waste of time is that\ud83d\ude16 \u2014 Joyce (@jycefisher) September 10, 2019\n\nYou went along with @Alyssa_Milano delusions of grandeur and self-importance on our tax dollars? Find someone who isn\u2019t \u201cacting\u201d like they care instead. \u2014 TheAlcoholMemoirs (@AlcoholMemoirs) September 10, 2019\n\nIs this a joke? \u2014 Bob Doyle (@doylebob) September 10, 2019\n\nYeah \u2014 while our border is being overrun you\u2019re talking to washed-up tv stars\u2026great strategy! \u2014 Milam Keith Smith (@Klickthedick) September 10, 2019\n\nAlyssa Milano? Really, Ted? \ud83d\ude44 \u2014 Little Sister\u2122 \ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f (@Little_Sister88) September 10, 2019\n\nHanging around with her too long may cause brain damage. \u2014 Americanist Al (@AlanAshton10) September 10, 2019\n\nWhy the hell would you meet with a D-list actress whose intelligence is on par with a 4 year old? \u2014 John Theisen (@LtColSlade24) September 10, 2019\n\nGood Luck! Tell her she makes a fool of herself on twitter! \u2014 Lioness \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@BarbaryLion17) September 10, 2019\n\nI wish you would shut down @Alyssa_Milano for being ignorant, hateful and divisive to Conservatives, Christians and Pro Life supporters. \u2014 Truth Seeker (@KYMomma2971) September 10, 2019\n\nI wouldn\u2019t give Milano the time of day \ud83d\ude21 \u2014 James Jackson (@freedomrisks) September 10, 2019\n\nYou should have @AndrewPollackFL! Fair is fair! \u2014 Sally Smilesalot \ud83d\ude0a (@shwilcott) September 10, 2019\n\nAbsolutely \u2014 not everyone who lost a child to gun violence that day agrees on the steps that need to be taken to make schools safer, nor that one of those steps has to be gun confiscation.\n\nPlease tell me, she came dressed in complete handmaid's garb. \u2014 2Progressive2BRelevant (@Progressive2B) September 10, 2019\n\nI watched a little; that must have been a difficult meet. \u2014 SeKend Amendmint (@amendmint) September 10, 2019\n\nThat is incredibly difficult to believe. By all means try. \u2014 Les (@Lefty_Les) September 10, 2019\n\nThis is a good thing. More of this. Sure would look good on all of you if you didnt come out of it calling names. \u2014 GaryMorgan (@garymo2007) September 10, 2019\n\nSorry man I tried to find out what this was about \u2026 cant you put a subject line? I listened to 5 straight minutes of someone talking about not feeling safe. Learn to protect yourself. It is a requirement. \u2014 Andy WarNoir (@AWarnoir) September 10, 2019\n\nMilano hasn\u2019t tweeted about it today \u2014 which is odd that Cruz would tweet the address for the live stream and she wouldn\u2019t, but we\u2019re sure we\u2019ll hear more about it later, once she edits down the video.\n\n* * *\n\nUpdate:\n\nMeeting\u2019s over:\n\nI just left. He was gracious. I\u2019m unsure if it changes anything. But appreciative for the opportunity to bridge the divide with civil, meaningful, discussion.
