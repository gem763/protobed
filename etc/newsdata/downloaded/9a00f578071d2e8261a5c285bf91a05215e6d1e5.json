But the Kiwi, who is now set to step down from his position, insisted this wasn\u2019t the case.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some good days, I don\u2019t think they should be washed away by two defeats [the other coming against Japan],\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe just met a team who I think are No 1 in the world for a reason.\u201d\n\nCaptain Rory Best, who joins Schmidt in stepping down from international duties with Ireland, said the team was \u201cincredibly disappointed\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of big guys in our team. It\u2019s not often you get a changing room in complete silence,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere were big men in tears.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a real rollercoaster of emotion [this tournament].\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe All Blacks were fantastic. We felt we had prepared well and had a game plan \u2013 they just came out of the blocks hard and never let us get off that again.\n\n\u201cThey were just really clinical, didn\u2019t let us get on the front foot. This is a momentum game, especially in knockout rugby. The boys will look back at this but you have to give enormous credit to the All Blacks.\u201d", "description": "Joe Schmidt has admitted that Ireland\u00a0were \u201cconsumed\u201d by righting the wrongs of their\u00a0past after once again failing to reach the semi-finals of the Rugby World Cup.
