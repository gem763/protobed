The concept of little cubes in space, or 3D pixels, has been around in the computer science literature since the 1970s. And it\u2019s almost like VR, where it was promised for decades, and wasn\u2019t really ever viable.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAnd now we\u2019re there. Minecraft is definitely something that taught a whole generation of kids to grow up with a world of large cubes. But the tantalizing thing is what happens if those cubes are not one meter on a side but but millimeter on its millimeters on the side? And that\u2019s what we call microvoxels, where you don\u2019t see the cubes. That\u2019s what we\u2019re working on.\u201d\n\nImage Credit: Atomontage\n\nThe Stockholm and Bratislava, Slovakia-based company (with official headquarters registered in Delaware) is taking advantage of more than 15 years of research and development in replacing polygons with small cubes for 3D graphics. One of the problems with polygons is they are kind of like \u201cshell graphics,\u201d or hollow on the inside, and they were meant to enable 3D on less powerful computers. But today\u2019s computers have the ability to render voxels better.\n\n\u201cSome of the modern games are certainly very realistic,\u201d Tabar said. \u201cHowever, there\u2019s a big trade off, and that the cost of what we call real interactivity or deep interactivity, which Minecraft now showed. It showed the potential if you let users actually manipulate the atomic element of the world. You unleash this huge creative power with within people and the ability for the world to be a lot more interesting. You can simulate different materials with properties that are quite rich. With polygons, you don\u2019t have this deep interactivity where you can dig into the ground and actually build a forest.\u201d\n\nThe change should enable far more realistic interactivity and powerful scalability than today\u2019s conventional surface-only polygon techniques, said Atomontage cofounder and CEO Branislav Siles in a statement.\n\nImage Credit: Atomontage\n\nAtomontage is building the foundations of volumetric worlds for millions of people to work, play, and learn within. The company\u2019s voxel (or \u201cvolume pixel\u201d) technology is targeted at 3D applications are designed and delivered across all sectors, including enterprise, entertainment, and education.\n\nContent creators can source, edit, and remix assets easily \u2014 while end-users will enjoy the deeply interactive experiences across a wide spectrum of today\u2019s most common PC, mobile, AR, and VR hardware.\n\nSince its launch in 2018, the company\u2019s tech team has grown to just over half a dozen senior software engineers with a combined 170 years of experience across game development, visual computing, and software architecture.\n\n\u201cAs creators continue to build ever-expansive worlds and truly massively multiplayer experiences, the issue of computational and graphical bottlenecks is a recurring theme,\u201d said Michael Cheung, partner at Makers Fund, in a statement. \u201cAtomontage, with their impressive amount of research focused on the solution, have the ability to upend the fundamentals by replacing polygons with voxels, enabling the creation of previously impossible experiences. We\u2019re excited to be on the journey with such visionaries in the industry.\u201d\n\nThe company has nine employees, mostly based in Slovakia. Tabar said that various academics have debated whether voxels or \u201cpoint clouds\u201d are the right way to move forward.\n\n\u201cThere are all these other effects that are more viable for simulation and rendering with microvoxels,\u201d Tabar said. \u201cLike physics simulation, it\u2019s very hard to have a computer figure out how to collide two clouds that are kind of amorphous. You don\u2019t really know the actual surface of them because they are kind of cloud like and their vector data [isn\u2019t clear]. With voxels, you can much more readily figure out what collision surfaces are between them. And that\u2019s what we show with our actual vehicles with rigid bodies rolling over terrain.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast year, we came out with a bunch of prototypes that showed breakthroughs that we\u2019ve been working on for 15 years like this,\u201d Tabar said. \u201cThose prototypes are not products. And now we are building the products with the seed funding and our team. In the next year, in 2020, we will have something that people can start using as a product.\u201d\n\nThe interest so far comes from across industries, beyond just games, with different types of platforms and companies showing interest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be showing some exciting stuff with partnerships,\u201d Tabar said.\n\nThe company is working with enterprises, which may launch the technology first, before game companies fully make use of it.\n\n\u201cRendering is kind of the easy part and it\u2019s something that enables real-time computer graphics, like real-time ray tracing,\u201d Tabar said. \u201cBut simulation is really the hard part because now you have to make the world change, and not just what is within view of your camera. You have to be able to have physics simulation or any kind of simulation to model the world like weather or structural integrity of buildings. And you can imagine chemical simulations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe games using voxels today show the tip of the iceberg of the potential of if you have the atomic unit of the world be these things that are simulated down to this level, and you allow people to manipulate them directly.\u201d", "description": "Atomontage has raised $1.95 million to enable microvoxels, a new kind of 3D simulation and rendering for games and other animations.", "authors": ["Dean Takahashi"], "top_image": "https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atomontage-Alligator.jpg?w=1200&strip=all", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
