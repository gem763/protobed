Traders expect a second leg sideways to up after the strong October rally. Tomorrow\u2019s could be the catalyst for the next leg up.\n\nBut the chart has been in a broad bear channel for over a year. Because of that, this selloff is probably not sufficient to convince traders that the EUR/USD has tested low enough or long enough. Since most bulls think the 7-day pullback has more to go, a reversal up from here will probably only last 2 \u2013 3 days.\n\nThe EUR/USD will likely have to clearly dip below the EMA and probably test the October 15 buy climax low. If it then reverses up, the bulls will be more confident that the 2nd leg up is beginning.\n\nOvernight EUR/USD Forex trading\n\nThe EUR/USD 5-minute Forex chart reversed up today from a perfect double bottom with Friday\u2019s low. While a second leg up on the daily chart might start today, the overnight range is only 30 pips. Also, today so far is the 3rd consecutive small day. In addition, all financial markets might remain quiet ahead of tomorrow\u2019s 11 am PST FOMC announcement. Unless the bars on the 5-minute chart get bigger and there is a 30 \u2013 50 pip breakout up or down, day traders will continue to look for 10 pip scalps today.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Al Brooks covering: EUR/USD.
