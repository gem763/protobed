The total loss to the taxpayer \u00a316,138.81 over an 20 month period.\n\nAt Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Walton wept in the dock as she faced jail after admitting fraud by false representation making an article for use in fraud and unlawfully retaining a wrongful credit.\n\nBut she was handed 10 months' imprisonment suspended for 18 months after saying her partner who was the 'breadwinner' in the family would have to give up his employment to look after the children if she went to jail. She was also ordered to complete 200 hours unpaid work and will face a proceeds of Crime hearing later which will establish how much money she has to pay back.\n\nSentencing Judge Angela Nield told Walton: 'This is not a victimless crime - the benefit system is supportive of many families and those who choose to claim against it falsely deprive others in significant need.\n\n'But quite simply you made a deliberate effort having initially made a legitimate claim for child care costs from the benefit system to exploit that system positively by asserting claims that were false and thereafter actually creating documents in support of those false claims.\n\n'Many people attend this court facing similar counts involving taking money from the benefits system. They appear because they have offended by doing nothing, they have offended by failing to notify changes in their circumstances, they have simply allowed matters to continue.\n\nWalton is pictured outside Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court, where she was handed a suspended sentence today\n\n'In contrast you took positive steps to take advantage of the benefits system, a system that supports many families in significant need who claim properly, fairly and legitimately from its public purse.\n\n'It is a system that as you have discovered to your cost is open to such claims because it relies heavily upon the honesty and integrity of those who claim from it.\n\n'You unfortunately over a period of 20 months had neither honesty nor integrity in your dealings with that system, a system that continues in certain aspects to support your family.\n\nWalton scammed money from the Department for Work and Pensions (pictured) by forging receipts for preschool fees\n\n'I have listened very carefully to all the information that has been provided to me. I was satisfied that these offences crossed the custody threshold and that they must be marked by a significant period of imprisonment.\n\n'But I have received additional information about your family circumstances and more particularly the needs of your son. He is very much dependent upon your support and the support of his father who is the main bread winner.\n\n'Whilst the presence of children in a household isn't a matter which necessarily prevents carers and others from being imprisoned in appropriate cases it is a matter that I have to take account of.\n\n'You have placed your family in significant jeopardy by your actions it is quite clear to me that were I to impose an immediate sentence of imprisonment which is justified in this case those who would suffer most would be your children.\n\n'Your husband would have to give up his work and become a primary carer for the family this would in turn lead to the family becoming more reliant on the state benefits system - a vicious cycle. A period of unpaid work will allow you to put back into the community some of the cost that you have taken from it.\n\nEarlier prosecutor Fiona Clancy said: 'The total amount of the fraud is \u00a316,138.81 and covers a period of 20 months from 29th June 2016 to 28th February 2018. Ms Walton lives with her partner and two children and on May 5 2015 she made a legitimate claim for universal credit due to low household income and she was under a duty to provide information on change of circumstances.\n\n'On the 13th August 2016 she reported to the DWP she had incurred separate care costs of \u00a3577.60 at Hazelwood Nursery but that proved to be false. A further telephone call reported child care costs with the same after school club of \u00a31057.81 and there was a further false conversation with further physical evidence of forged receipts.\n\n'She reported to the DWP that she incurred child care costs from Giggles Nursery of \u00a31109 on 21st August 2017 and reported further child care costs. All her contact was logged, all of the receipts she provided were given to the DWP - but the receipts she provided were found to be forgeries. She was interviewed andadmitted false claims for her children's care and indicated she did so because she liked spending money.'\n\nIn mitigation barrister James Preece said: 'The childcare costs were originally genuine childcare costs, however her child couldn't go to the childcare because of his behaviour. At that stage she made the decision that she now deeply regrets to continue to suggest to the DWP that there were child care costs.\n\n'Whilst the sum has been accepted and was received over this period of time this is not a case where she was living an extravagant lifestyle. The money went back into supporting the family and the family needs.\n\n'Ms Walton has never done anything like this before and finds herself for the first time in crown court, it has caused her to think long and hard about her offending. It has over the few weeks she has been awaiting sentence been at the forefront of her mind.\n\n'There were full and frank admissions and guilty pleas she wants me to communicate she is very sorry for what she had done.\n\n'Another factor is where immediate custody results in harmful impact upon others, this is a case where she has two children and the pre-sentence report concludes the impact of custody upon the children would be detrimental in terms of their emotional wellbeing and educational needs.\n\n'Ms Walton's son needs further support she is the main carer for him and if she were not around he wouldn't be able to cope without her.\n\n'He needs to be taken to the door of the school that is one of the things that she does for him. Her partner being the main breadwinner and having to go out early in the morning and having to run the scaffolding work that he does the duty falls to Miss Walton.'\n\n'She is somebody who is important in providing the extra support that her son requires. This court hearing has had a salutary effect on Ms Walton.'", "description": "Adele Walton, 34, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, pocketed an extra \u00a3800 every month as she forged receipts for nursery and pre-school fees but was today handed a suspended sentence.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/11/20371568-0-image-a-13_1572435691644.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
