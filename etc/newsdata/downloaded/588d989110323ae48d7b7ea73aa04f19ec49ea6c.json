But now they look for just a 1.9 per cent gain, and foresee profits falling 4.1 per cent in the third quarter from a year ago, according to FactSet data.\n\nJunk bonds are being dumped, pushing the yield spread on company debt rated CCC to 10.7 percentage points from 6.7 percentage points early last year, foretelling earnings weakness. Investors are shunning Uber, WeWork and other so-called unicorns that have no earnings horns.\n\nReal consumer spending is 70 per cent of GDP and it declined in seven of 13 post-war recessions, though it rose in the other six. Still, even a slowing of growth in household outlays, combined with weakness in capital spending, housing and foreign trade, will push the economy into decline.\n\nJob growth is slowing with an average of 154,000 new monthly payroll jobs in the last six months, compared with 204,000 in the previous half-year period. Average hourly earnings growth slowed from 3.2 per cent in the year ending in August to 2.9 per cent in September.\n\nConsumer confidence and expectations can have significant effects on future spending, and both the University of Michigan and Conference Board surveys have fallen in recent months. A year ago, I was a lonely voice calling for a recession to start in 2019. Now, others are joining, and instilling caution in consumers that can be self-fulfilling.\n\nA New York Fed survey shows a precipitous drop in consumer expectations of inflation, and the central bank rightly fears that households will hold off buying in anticipation of lower prices. The University of Michigan survey finds continuing declines in households' evaluation of buying conditions for vehicles and houses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe survey also found that, as of July, 59 per cent of respondents expect interest rates to fall over the next 12 months, up from 22 per cent in October 2018. Low and anticipated lower rates encourage people to delay spending and increase savings to meet retirement and other goals.\n\nOngoing polarisation of income and assets also means more money for the wealthy, who account for almost all household saving, and less for low-income spenders. The overall household savings rate has climbed from 1.9 per cent in 2005 to more than 8 per cent in August, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and will no doubt continue to rise. Some 28 per cent of Americans have no financial reserves and only 18 per cent can cover six months or more of expenses, according to Bankrate's Financial Security poll.\n\nIncreases in auto, credit card and student loans are pressuring consumers to restrain spending. Total household debt leaped from 65 per cent of after-tax income in the early 1980s to 133 per cent in 2007.\n\nMortgage repayments and write-offs have reduced it, but only to 99 per cent. It will probably return to its long-run norm, especially as the baby boomer generation is forced to save if it doesn't want to keep working long after retirement age.\n\nLook for weakness in employment and consumer spending in the coming months. That will seal the case for a recession.\n\nA. Gary Shilling is president of A.
