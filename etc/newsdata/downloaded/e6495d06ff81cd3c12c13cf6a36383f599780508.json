(The Weather Channel/Screenshot)\n\nFirst it was CNN. Then MSNBC. Now even the Weather Channel wants to ask presidential candidates about climate change.\n\nThe weather news network \u2014 better known for tracking hurricanes than following political campaigns \u2014 is set to air an hour-long prime-time special of interviews with nine 2020 White House hopefuls focused on how to tackle the causes and effects of global warming.\n\nThe special, planned for Nov. 7, is yet another sign that the issue of global warming is getting more media attention than in past presidential election cycles. And it's a win for climate activists -- though they say it is still not getting coverage commensurate with the threat it poses to the world.\n\nSens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.), two of the top-polling candidates in the Democratic field, will participate. So will other Democrats, including South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and Sens. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and Cory Booker (N.J.). And three long-shot contenders for the GOP nomination against President Trump \u2014 former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh, ex-South Carolina governor Mark Sanford and and former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld \u2014 also will be interviewed.\n\nThe biggest name not included in the Weather Channel special is Joe Biden. The former vice president won't participate because of scheduling issues with the network, according to a Biden campaign official.\n\nBiden did appear at the CNN town hall on climate change last month, where he was pointedly questioned by an activist about a fundraiser co-hosted by a businessman who helped start a natural gas company. Biden declined to participate in the following climate forum, on MSNBC, as did Warren and three other major Democratic candidates.\n\nUnlike last month's CNN and MSNBC climate forums, which aired live interviews with the candidates, the Weather Channel special will show pretaped interviews of the candidates. And it has meteorologists \u2014 not just journalists \u2014 grilling the politicians about their climate plans. Among those experts is Rick Knabb, former director of the National Hurricane Center and the network\u2019s on-air hurricane expert.\n\nPolling over the past decade shows that meteorologists are increasingly convinced that man-made global warming is happening, with some even talking about climate change on air. That shift came even as John Coleman, a weather forecaster who helped launch the Weather Channel in 1982, became better known in later years for championing skepticism about human-caused climate change.\n\nNora Zimmett, the Weather Channel's chief content officer and executive vice president, says her station takes the threat of climate change seriously. \u201cAs the nation\u2019s only 24-hour science-based news network, we are proud to expand our original programming and address the serious conversations about climate change,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nWhile the big news networks have carved out television time for forums on the issue, that hasn't always translated into coverage during marquee event. CNN's climate town hall, for example, was a whopping seven hours long, with candidates sitting for back-to-back interviews. But when it came time to host an actual debate between the candidates last week, CNN anchors did not ask a single climate-related question.\n\nYou are reading The Energy 202, our must-read tipsheet on energy and the environment.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2019\n\n\u2014 Trump announces Rick Perry\u2019s successor: The president said he plans to nominate Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette to replace Perry at the helm of the agency. The president announced the decision via Twitter, calling Brouillette\u2019s experience \u201cunparalleled.\u201d\n\nMore about Brouillette: He \"has served as deputy energy secretary since August 2017. He had worked for the agency 14 years prior as assistant secretary for congressional and intergovernmental affairs in the George W. Bush administration,\u201d The Post\u2019s Colby Itkowitz and Tom Hamburger report. \u201cIn between, Brouillette was a top lobbyist for Ford Motor Co. and then the head of public policy for USAA, a financial institution for military families.\u201d\n\nHe \"has served as deputy energy secretary since August 2017.

David Bernhardt replaced Ryan Zinke as Interior secretary while Andrew Wheeler took over for Scott Pruitt as Environmental Protection Agency administrator. Perry's team doesn't comply with subpoena: Perry, still energy secretary for the moment, missed the deadline to produce documents subpoenaed amid the impeachment inquiry, The Post's John Wagner, Colby Itkowitz and Michael Brice-Saddler report. In a letter to House Democratic lawmakers, the department\u2019s assistant secretary Melissa Burnison called the inquiry illegitimate. \u201cEven if the inquiry was validly authorized, much of the information sought in the subpoena appears to consist of confidential Executive Branch communications that are potentially protected by privilege and would require careful review to ensure that no such information is improperly disclosed,\u201d Burnison wrote.\n\nRep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.). (Susan Walsh/AP)\n\n\u2014 House GOP member who pushed carbon tax is retiring: Rep. Francis Rooney, a Republican who represents a coastal district in Florida, announced he won\u2019t seek reelection. Rooney has emerged as a leader in his party on tackling environmental issues, pushing other Republicans to act on climate change, co-chairing the revived Climate Solutions Caucus and introducing his own carbon tax legislation, while few other Republicans have backed such a tax.\n\nRooney announced his retirement a day after saying he would consider voting to impeach Trump: \u201cRooney told reporters Friday when asked about the political consequences of potentially impeaching Trump that he wanted \u2018to get the facts and do the right thing because I\u2019ll be looking at my children a lot longer than I\u2019m looking to anybody in this building,\u2019 \u201d The Post\u2019s Itkowitz and Mike DeBonis write.\n\nSenator Mitt Romney (R-Utah). (Al Drago/Bloomberg)\n\n\u2014 Romney calls for \u201caggressive\u201d climate action: In a talk with Goldman Sachs\u2019 John Waldron posted earlier this month, Sen. Mitt Romney said he wants to take \u201caggressive action to reduce the human contribution to greenhouse gases and to global warming.\u201d\n\nTo quote: The Utah Republican said he\u2019s sought to push colleagues who are skeptical about human contribution to climate change to take action. \u201cI say to my colleagues who say to me, \u2018I don\u2019t think we\u2019re causing global warming.\u2019 I say \u2018what if there is a one out of ten chance we\u2019re causing it?\u2019\u2026 I think it\u2019s more like nine out of ten chance. But even if you think it\u2019s one out of ten chance and if it\u2019s going to be as catastrophic as that would suggest\u2026 wouldn\u2019t you do something to try and make it better?\u201d\n\nThe Utah Republican said he\u2019s sought to push colleagues who are skeptical about human contribution to climate change to take action. \u201cI say to my colleagues who say to me, \u2018I don\u2019t think we\u2019re causing global warming.\u2019 I say \u2018what if there is a one out of ten chance we\u2019re causing it?\u2019\u2026 I think it\u2019s more like nine out of ten chance.

(Jeff Chiu/AP)\n\n\u2014 Another day, another potential wildfire-related blackout in California: Southern California Edison warned residents about potential preemptive blackouts amid high winds and wildfire risks this weekend. The utility was considering shutting power for more than 56,000 customers in eight counties across the southern part of the state, the Los Angeles Times reports.\n\nThe state could be facing a decade of these shutoffs: During a meeting of the California Public Utilities Commission in San Francisco, Pacific Gas & Electric Corp.\u2019s chief executive said the utility could be forced to continue preventive shut-offs for up to a decade in Central and Northern California, the L.A. Times reports. \u201cIn his presentation to the commission, [William D. Johnson] laid out a long list of measures the utility has undertaken to improve its handling of future shut-offs, while limiting their duration,\u201d per the report.\n\nDuring a meeting of the California Public Utilities Commission in San Francisco, Pacific Gas & Electric Corp.\u2019s chief executive said the utility could be forced to continue preventive shut-offs for up to a decade in Central and Northern California, the L.A.

Amid the outages, California companies turn to solar: Numerous businesses in the Golden State have sought to prevent financial and productivity losses during power outages by turning to solar power. \u201cTech companies in particular have spent years touting their efforts to become more environmentally friendly via solar power and other ways to offset their huge carbon footprints. Most of the companies release annual reports tallying their gains and the way they\u2019re improving the world,\u201d The Post\u2019s Marie C. Baca reports.\n\nFish swim over a patch of bleached coral in Hawaii's Kaneohe Bay off the island of Oahu. (Caleb Jones/AP)\n\n\u2014 How the world\u2019s ecosystems are transforming: A recent study found the world\u2019s ecosystems are reorganizing rapidly, and that it\u2019s \u201cprobably the result of local extinctions, the introduction of invasive species and migrations motivated by climate change,\u201d The Post\u2019s Sarah Kaplan reports. On average, a fourth of all plant and animal species in an ecosystem are being replaced every decade. Marine ecosystems in particular are experiencing this transformation at high rates, she adds. \u201cThe waters of the western Atlantic and the northwest Australian shelf experienced rates of species turnover much higher than the global average. Tropical regions also seemed to change more than temperate ones, perhaps because these already-warm areas have now been heated to temperatures for which most species are not adapted.\u201d\n\nDominion Energy's Scott Solar farm in Powhatan, Va. (Steve Helber/AP)\n\n\u2014 Virginia will use renewable energy in state facilities: Gov. Ralph Northam (D) announced a contract with Dominion Energy, the state\u2019s biggest utility, to buy renewable energy for government offices, The Post\u2019s Gregory S. Schneider reports. Under the deal, the state will target acquiring 30 percent of electricity from renewable sources by 2022. \u201cThe deal calls for Dominion to supply state government facilities with 420 megawatts of renewable energy, which the governor\u2019s office said is enough to power 100,000 homes,\u201d Schneider writes. \u201cThe bulk of the purchase \u2014 345 megawatts \u2014 will come from solar installations owned by Dominion.\u201d\n\nPolitics Trump reversed course on hosting G-7 at his club after learning that impeachment-weary Republicans were tired of defending him From the moment the White House announced that President Trump had decided to hold the 2020 Group of Seven summit at his golf resort, it became inextricably linked with his possible impeachment.
