You\u2019re not allowed to make contact with the head, and you certainly need to use your arms, and he didn\u2019t do either,\u201d Gold said.\n\nThe United States were second best in every department on Thursday and had learned a hard lesson, he said.\n\n\u201cWe lost every single aspect of today\u2019s game,\u201d added Gold, who also bemoaned the loss of Ainuu only two minutes into the game.\n\n\u201cWhen it rains it pours. To lose David, and then to lose Will to a bad concussion, and then to lose Quilly to a red card, it was a bit of a calamity in Kobe tonight.\u201d\n\nThe lower tier teams at the World Cup have earned praise for their improved showing in Japan and while Gold had said before the game that their goal had been to establish the credibility of U.S. rugby they fell way short on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was credible tonight, not by our standards,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re not better than England but we\u2019re a better rugby team than that.\u201d\n\nU.S. captain Blaine Scully said that while the team were disappointed in the performance it was what they did next that was important.\n\n\u201cOur reaction is what\u2019s going to define us,\u201d he said \u201cShow up to work tomorrow, try to get better and put in an improved performance next week. As athletes that\u2019s the decisions we\u2019re going to have to make.\u201d", "description": "United States flanker John Quill became the first player to be sent off at the 2019 Rugby World Cup when he was shown a red card for leading with his shoulder into the head of England's Owen Farrell on Thursday and the Eagles also lost two key players to injury in the Pool C match.", "authors": ["Peter Rutherford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
