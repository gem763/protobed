'Be advised, we still need an increase,' one said on the team radio when, with 1.5 miles to go, the projections suggested a finishing time fractionally outside two hours. 'I think this is all he can do,' replied another. 'He's doing his thing. Patience,' interjected a third.\n\nEliud Kipchoge will again attempt to run a marathon in less than two hours on Saturday\n\nBy a mere 25 seconds, the Kenyan failed. His performance, in May 2017, took seven seconds off every mile run by the then-world record holder Dennis Kimetto, Kipchoge's Kenyan compatriot, yet was still not enough.\n\nThe day which began with a 3am alarm call, a breakfast of natural yoghurt and fruit, and a starting pistol fired in the stone cold pre-dawn light at 5.45am at the Monza race track \u2013 selected because of its flatness, wide bends and a climate which proved warmer and wetter than anticipated \u2013 ended with expressions of consolation for Kipchoge. He could not disguise the disappointment.\n\nOn Saturday, he will again attempt the quest so significant to him that he gave no consideration to competing in the marathon at World Athletics Championships in Doha last week.\n\nIn Monza, the scientific support team was put together by Nike \u2013 whose branding levels underlined their desperation to score a commercial coup. This time, British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, through his company Ineos, is funding Kipchoge's shot at the 'sub-two' \u2013 one of sport's great unconquered frontiers.\n\nThe athlete in question is 5ft 6in, weighs a mere 9st, yet runs with near-perfect balance and \u2013 critically \u2013 generates very little lactate, the acid which brings stress to the muscles and turns 13.1 miles an hour into torture.\n\nLast September he ran the distance of 26 miles and 385 yards in the Berlin Marathon just 99 seconds outside the two-hour mark, shattering Kimetto's record by a minute and 18 seconds. In April, he eased away from Sir Mo Farah soon after crossing Tower Bridge, finishing in 2hr 2min 38sec.\n\nBut the 'sub-two' requires human intervention; a support system which means that the time he sets six days from now at a 9.6-kilometre loop of Vienna's Prater public park will not be recognised by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).\n\nRatcliffe had hoped Battersea Park or Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey would be the venue, though a greater prospect of dry weather and Vienna's willingness to close surrounding roads proved telling.\n\nAs in in Monza, there will a pacer car - set 20 yards ahead of Kipchoge and his phalanx of support runners \u2013 which will fire a fluorescent green laser beam onto the road to mark where he needs to be if he is to break two hours. The laser will actually be set at a time 10 or 20 seconds below the two-hour mark, ensuring that Kipchoge will be ahead of the target and thus not denied his prize by a stumble.\n\nThe pace-setters \u2013 all elite marathon and middle-distance runners \u2013 will, as in Monza, be swapped in for three or six-mile sections as they cannot keep pace with Kipchoge for longer. Their contribution also obviates any prospect of recognition by the IAAF, which insists that all pace setters must run from the start.\n\nThe 'pacing' team have been training in a wind tunnel to find the optimum position from which they can help Kipchoge's aerodynamics. Their choreography, immaculate in Monza, must be so again. One false step and the enterprise will be over. The bicyclists who will draw alongside Kipchoge to provide drinks \u2013 another breach of IAAF rules which decree bottles be picked up from tables - have also been rehearsing the simple manoeuvre for months.\n\nAs in Monza, Kipchoge will run in the Vaporfly, a shoe containing a highly controversial carbon-fibre plate in the soles, supposedly capable of improving times by one per cent over any other shoe.\n\nBut this time it will be the updated Vaporfly Next shoe. And the Kenyan will this time be consuming an energy drink, made by the Swedish company Maurten, which contains more carbohydrates than other such drink and also forms a hydrogel when it reaches the stomach \u2013 generating more energy during a marathon without causing gastrointestinal problems. The quality of drink intake is seen as a rare area for marginal gain on Monza.\n\nYet more than these products, it is physiology which puts Kipchoge on the cusp of history. What amazed scientists on the Monza project was his capacity to use oxygen to produce energy \u2013 the 'VO2 max' factor, as the sports scientists know it. Taken with his lactate threshold and running economy \u2013 the latter was affected by Monza's unexpected 12C (54F) heat \u2013 he remains the only individual on the planet who could come close to crossing this threshold.\n\nThe view from the Kipchoge camp is that the decision to stage the 2017 run without spectators also denied him a performance boost. 'He really needed that support. It was different without it,' says one of the 34-year-old's support team.\n\nHis set-up certainly feels very different from two years ago. Kipchoge's preparations in the village of Kaptagat in Kenya's Rift Valley is a far cry from the supercharged, slightly hyper, testing regime at Nike's Beavertown complex in Oregon.\n\nKipchoge eats from crammed benches in a very basic canteen with fellow athletes, shares gym sessions with up to 30 others, runs through the Valley's clay tracks where school buses and lorries overtake him, and drinks from an open tap in a field.\n\nLast year he ran distance of 26 miles and 385 yards just 99 seconds outside two-hour mark\n\nSome say this entire venture is too contrived to bear comparison with Roger Bannister breaking the four-minute mile in 1954 in an equally basic setting. Professor Ross Tucker, the respected South African sports scientist has described it as getting man to the moon by taking gravity out of the equation.\n\n'It would be the same as breaking the high jump record [set in 1993 by Cuba's Javier Sotomayor at a height of 2.45m] on Mars where there is less gravity,' said Tucker.\n\nBut Kipchoge describes the significance of it in a way which makes you see why his team insist that psychological strength is the biggest asset, allowing him to blank pain: 'I can numerically assess almost everything,' said one of the Monza team. 'But the mind is a big, blank open box. How can I quantify Kipchoge's mind?'\n\nHis support team say that the fact he has attempted this once before will be significant when it comes to Saturday's run - which will finish in the dark, under purpose-built floodlights, because it will be cooler then.\n\nBut above the familiarity of those fluorescent green lines, he also knows the personal devastation that comes with falling short by a 25-second margin. It was sympathetically put to him at trackside in Monza that he'd run an extraordinary 26 miles. 'But it's called two hours,' he replied, grimacing.
