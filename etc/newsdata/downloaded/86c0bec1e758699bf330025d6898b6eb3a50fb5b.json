And since millions of ordinary Americans don\u2019t even have access to the mansion, those who are privileged enough to enjoy its modest protections \u2014 especially those who\u2019ve secured a relatively dry and warm spot within the crumbling structure \u2014 tend to express satisfaction with the status quo in opinion surveys. So, when voters are told that they can have cheaper, more comprehensive protection from a brand-new mansion \u2014 so long as they accept a modest increase in property taxes, which would be fully offset by savings on utilities and maintenance \u2014 many evince skepticism. And once Big Ghostbuster starts airing fear-mongering ads about how tearing down the existing structure will turn U.S. into Venezuela, that skepticism is liable to harden into opposition.\n\nThis is how I described the political economy of American health care back in April. And I think the extended metaphor still does a decent job of illustrating how our status-quo insurance system has managed to sustain itself politically, even as it fails the American public profoundly. But a new study from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) suggests that conditions in our figurative mansion are deteriorating so rapidly \u2014 and the hospitable rooms growing so few and far between \u2014 that the politics of structural change may be undergoing a transformation.\n\nAs indicated above, the primary obstacle to rebuilding our ramshackle health-care system is the immense power of the industries and interest groups that have monetized its rot. But historically, public opinion has posed its own discrete challenges. Voters often display a strong sense of loss aversion, valuing the preservation of what they have over the uncertain promise of something better. And in the domain of health care \u2014 where the stakes of losing what one has (if one is privileged enough to have coverage in the general vicinity of \u201caffordable\u201d) are potentially life and death \u2014 this tendency has been especially acute.\n\nA distinct but related feature of U.S. public opinion is that it tends to be \u201cthermostatic,\u201d moving left when there\u2019s a Republican in the White House, then right when a Democrat moves back in. Once again, this general tendency is particularly strong on the issue of health care: In 2007, 69 percent of voters told Gallup that it was the federal government\u2019s responsibility to ensure all Americans have health-care coverage; by the second year of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, that figure was down to 47 percent. Then Donald Trump\u2019s election made the concept of universal health care majoritarian again.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that this pattern is informed by the welfare chauvinism of some white voters (i.e., there may be some GOP voters whose comfort with big government ebbs and flows, depending on whether the party of white identity politics controls its levers). But whatever its origins, the phenomenon has been a perennial source of difficulty for progressive reformers, especially those who demand answers commensurate with the scale of the system\u2019s problems: With the public already predisposed toward loss aversion and ideological fickleness, the health-care industry (and its ad-makers) have had little trouble killing off any reform that dared to threaten its share of GDP.\n\nFor these reasons, a lot of health-care punditry presumes that the public\u2019s appetite for Medicare for All \u2014 or even a Medicare buy-in \u2014 will swiftly decline once Democrats have the opportunity to actually implement it. And that scenario remains plausible. But there\u2019s increasing reason to believe that \u201cnext time will be different\u201d \u2014 because with each passing year, those loss-averse voters with employer-provided insurance have less and less to lose: According to KFF\u2019s latest survey, the average annual premium for a job-based, family health-insurance plan is now $20,756 \u2014 54 percent higher than it was just ten years ago. And the price of such plans is rising even faster for their actual beneficiaries, as employers offload rising health-care costs onto workers: Since 2009, the average premium paid by employees for a family plan has jumped by 71 percent to $6,015.\n\nAmong workers themselves, the distribution of the growing burden is deeply regressive. Since high-wage workers have more bargaining power than low-wage ones, firms force far more cost-sharing on the latter than the former. As a result, an increasing number of low-wage workers are forgoing employer-provided coverage. As Bloomberg notes:\n\nIn firms where more than 35% of employees earn less than $25,000 a year, workers would have to contribute more than $7,000 for a family health plan \u2026 Only one-third of employees at such firms are on their employer\u2019s health plans, compared with 63% at higher-wage firms \u2026\n\nSome employers have opted to keep premiums affordable by diverting rising costs into higher deductibles, a policy that effectively takes from sick workers to give to healthy ones. Which goes over well with the median worker \u2014 right up until he or she moves from that second category to the first.\n\nCritically, even if your employer does shoulder a hefty portion of your health-care costs, the existence of that new expense on its balance sheet may ultimately take money from your pocket. The more cash the average business has to fork over to the health-care sector, the less it can afford to spend on wages and other benefits. This reality is likely among the many reasons that U.S. wage growth has been so tepid in recent decades.\n\nA chart from New York Times weaves these disparate trends into a unified portrait of abject policy failure:\n\nChart: The New York Times | Source: Kaiser Family Foundation Employer Health Benefits Survey\n\nIt is true that, for most of the decade documented here, American public opinion on health-care policy actually trended rightward. One could attribute that fact to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s peculiar failures, or to thermostatic public opinion. Either way, it is an argument against the assumption that worsening objective conditions will necessarily build public support for radical reform.\n\nStill, it\u2019s hard not to think that there will eventually be a breaking point. Absent massive policy changes, things are going to get worse before they get better. As the boomer generation ages, it will consume more and more health-care services, thereby driving up their price. Meanwhile, the burgeoning demand for drugs that ease the burdens of senescence is leading Big Pharma to roll out exorbitantly expensive new medicines. These demographic-driven cost pressures aren\u2019t unique to the U.S. But America\u2019s uniquely weak cost controls make them harder to absorb. Under our existing system, the U.S. spends several times more than similar nations on health-care administration, pharmaceuticals, and physicians\u2019 salaries. In return, Americans enjoy the 29th best health-care system in the world (just behind the Czech Republic\u2019s), according to the Lancet.\n\nSource:: Source: Harvard T.H.

But as the costs of sustaining an extractive health-care sector inexorably rise, more and more politically empowered, upper-middle-class Americans will be unable to insulate themselves from the burden. This won\u2019t automatically turn affluent moderates into single-payer supporters. In fact, a sense of scarcity could potentially undermine social solidarity and thus support for universal coverage. But a continuation of present trends will lead influential constituencies to demand cost controls on the health-care sector with increasing vehemence. A Times interview with a bagel-shop owner in Utica, New York, named Anne Wadsworth is illustrative of where upper-middle-class health-care politics is trending.\n\n\u201cI was all on board for Obamacare,\u201d she said, but it proved not to be \u201ca long-term solution. It doesn\u2019t lower the costs for people.\u201d Ms. Wadsworth is wary of the sweeping plans now proposed by the Democratic presidential candidates, which she worries will become a political football, like the Affordable Care Act, and fail to address the underlying issues. \u201cI just think health care costs need to go down,\u201d she said.\n\nWhether progressives can persuade voters like Wadsworth that only \u201csweeping plans\u201d can deliver the cost-savings she seeks \u2014 by eliminating redundant insurance bureaucracies, rationalizing hospital budgets, and bringing U.S. physician salaries into closer alignment with international standards \u2014 is unclear. But that task should become a bit easier, as the roof above their heads starts caving in.", "description": "the average annual premium for job-based, family health insurance plan is now $20,756 \u2013 54 percent higher than it was just 10 years ago, according to a new survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation.", "authors": ["Eric Levitz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/27/27-healthcare-costs.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
