It was like I had come from another planet. How insensitive is that?\"\n\nMs Das said she never faced such a problem at airports outside India.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Empowering India's disabled people\n\n\"It is unacceptable that every time in India, they want me to take off my callipers which effectively means they are asking me to take off my trousers,\" she said.\n\nShe said the staff of GoAir, the private airline they had flown, told her wheelchair-bound colleague Jeeja Ghosh that she could not travel unless she had an escort.\n\n\"Jeeja is an adult\" who travels around the globe on her own and feels \"very insulted\" by the airline, Ms Das said.\n\n\"We protested, we said this was discriminatory, so the person at the check-in counter apologised. But we are not angry with her. It's not an individual problem. It's how an airline treats a person with disability,\" she added.\n\nAfter news of their ordeal was covered by Indian press, Kolkata airport authorities on Monday tweeted an apology to the two activists.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @aaikolairport We would like to sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused to Ms Jeeja Ghosh & Ms Kuhu Das during check-in process at #KolkataAirport. The matter is being strongly taken up with concerned teams to ensure that such incidents does not happen again.@AAI_Official @MoCA_GoI \u2014 Kolkata Airport (@aaikolairport) October 21, 2019 Report\n\nTwo years ago, authorities said passengers with disability would no longer have to remove their prosthetic limbs for screening at airports, but two years later, it seems the order is yet to reach the police officials on security duty.\n\nIndia has more than 26 million people living with physical or learning disabilities, but there is little infrastructure to support them in their everyday life.\n\nCampaigners say disabled people also routinely face stigma, discrimination and harassment.\n\nTwo years back, a female para-athlete was forced to sleep on the floor of a train as she had been allotted an upper berth against the rules.\n\nIn 2016, a disability activist, who uses a wheelchair, was assaulted in India for not standing up to the national anthem being played in a cinema.", "description": "Authorities at India's Kolkata airport apologise to disability activists Kuhu Das and Jeeja Ghosh.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13236/production/_109309387_mediaitem109309386.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
