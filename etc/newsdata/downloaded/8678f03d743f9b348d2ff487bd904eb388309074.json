Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and filmmaker Michael Moore, in his first rally since he suffered a heart attack earlier this month. \u201cI am back!\u201d he declared, to swelling cheers.\n\nSurrounded by nearly 26,000 supporters at Queensbridge Park in New York, Sanders seemed energized by the enthusiastic show of force.\n\n\u201cI am more than ready to carry on with you the epic struggle that we face today. I am more than ready to assume the office of President of the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nThe endorsement from Ocasio-Cortez, one of the most sought-after in the Democratic Party, comes at an important time for the Sanders campaign. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has also been attracting large crowds, substantial fundraising numbers and has surpassed Sanders in a number of national and early-state polls. And after Sanders\u2019 heart attack Oct. 1, some questioned his ability to keep campaigning.\n\nBut on Saturday, Ocasio-Cortez backed Sanders, describing him as the one who can make change happen. \u201cIn 2016, he fundamentally changed politics in America,\u201d she said, before introducing the Vermont Senator as her \u201ct\u00edo Bernie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe right now have one of the best Democratic presidential primary fields in a generation,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said, \u201cand much of that is thanks to the work that Bernie Sanders has done in his entire life.\u201d\n\nThe 30-year-old Congresswoman spoke for nearly 20 minutes about how Sanders shaped her own political awakening, saying that his politics caused her to \u201cquestion and assert and recognize my inherent value as a human being that deserves healthcare, housing, education and a living wage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to say that the only reason that I had any hope in launching a longshot campaign for Congress is because Bernie Sanders proved that you can run a grassroots campaign and win in an America where we almost thought it wasn\u2019t possible,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nMany attendees on Saturday had heard the news of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement, along with that of Rep. Ilhan Omar, last week. For some, the Congresswomen\u2019s backing simply confirmed their own support for the Vermont Senator. \u201cI feel like AOC is even closer to my heart,\u201d said Steve Alvarez, a school psychologist who grew up in the Queens district that Ocasio-Cortez now represents. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t endorse him, I would\u2019ve been surprised.\u201d\n\nBut others, who are still shopping for a candidate in a crowded Democratic field, said Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement may sway their opinion. \u201cIt seems really early. If she\u2019s doing this it must be from the heart and where her beliefs lie,\u201d said Patrick Roberts, a 32-year-old bartender from New York. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of her so I\u2019m going to pay attention to it.\u201d\n\nThe high-profile progressive endorsements come just as Warren\u2019s campaign appeared poised to overtake Sanders\u2019. The two outspoken liberal Senators share similar policy goals on health care, corporate accountability and access to higher education, but differ in important ways as well. Sanders is a Socialist, whereas Warren is an avowed capitalist who believes we need to reform the current economic system. The recent endorsements are a blow to Warren\u2019s rising campaign.\n\nIn addition to the New York Congresswoman and Moore, Sanders\u2019 rally on Saturday featured a lineup of speakers including Jane Sanders, his wife; Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, the major of San Juan, Puerto Rico; Tiffany Cab\u00e1n, a local politician who narrowly lost the district attorney race in Queens this year; and former Ohio State Senator Nina Turner. The group pushed back at the idea that Sanders\u2019 age would be an issue and emphasized that he\u2014and not anyone else on the Democratic stage\u2014would bring the revolution they were looking for.\n\nMoore, who is 65, told the crowd that Sanders\u2019 age would be an asset to his presidency. \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s too old: the electoral college is too old. A $7.25 minimum wage\u2014that\u2019s too old. Women not being paid the same as men\u2014that\u2019s too old,\u201d he said. \u201dThousands and thousands of student debt. What is that? Too old. A $10,000 deductible for your healthcare. What is that? Too old.\u201d\n\nTurner spoke to the diverse crowd about why other Democratic candidates could not produce the same results as she said Sanders would. \u201cThere are many copies,\u201d she said, pointedly not mentioning any other candidate by name. \u201cBut there is only one original. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d take a copy, baby, when you can have the original.\u201d", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders addressed a raucous crowd on Saturday as he showcased two high-profile progressive endorsements, Rep.
