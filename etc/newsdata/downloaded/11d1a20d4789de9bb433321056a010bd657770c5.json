China bought 14.7 million tonnes of iron ore from Iran in 2018, accounting for 1.4% of its total imports.\n\n\u201cApplying such export tariffs from this month is too early,\u201d said Keyvan Jafari Tehrani, an independent analyst of the iron and steel industry.\n\n\u201cI doubt whether the quantities (Iran) used to sell to China can be absorbed totally by the local market at the beginning.\u201d", "description": "China has taken fewer shipments of iron ore from Iran over August and September, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, as additional export tariffs due to be imposed by Tehran have dampened risk appetites in the world's biggest steelmaker.", "authors": ["Min Zhang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
