A bride is being slammed for saying she wants to have a cash bar at her wedding \u2014 and charge her guests enough for drinks to recoup some of her own wedding costs (stock image)\n\nThe bride posted anonymously on Reddit, explaining that she and her fianc\u00e9 'are pretty grossed out by the wedding industry and are trying to keep our wedding as cheap as possible.'\n\n'So for example,' she said, 'we are having the ceremony and reception at my uncle\u2019s farm (free of charge) out in the country, my good friend from college who owns a catering business agreed to do our catering for free as a wedding gift, and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s good friends with a band that will play at our wedding for free also as a wedding gift.\n\n'We got my dress and his suit from Goodwill and got them altered. Everything said and done we will be paying less than $2k for our wedding.'\n\nThe alcohol, though, is proving to be a cost they can't keep low for 150 people.\n\n'The idea of paying for all of that booze is making us stressed out,' she wrote. 'It\u2019d be at least $1k.\n\n'We thought about it and decided to do a cash bar. We figured we could buy the booze and pay one of my cousins to be bartender for the night,' she went on.\n\nWhat's more, though, she figures they could make some money on the deal.\n\n'We realized we could probably recoup some of our costs on the other wedding expenses by charging moderate prices for drinks - win-win!'\n\nThe couple was 'set' on the idea until the bride mentioned it to a bridesmaid, who 'flipped out and said that would be incredibly tacky'.\n\nWe realized we could probably recoup some of our costs on the other wedding expenses by charging moderate prices for drinks - win-win!\n\n'I was sort of taken aback by this,' wrote the bride. 'I\u2019ve looked online and cash bars at weddings are pretty common. It seems ridiculous to pay to get everyone drunk.\n\n'My other friends and family seem pretty split and I\u2019m starting to wonder if this is actually a faux pas. Am I the a**hole?'\n\nRedditors agreed pretty unanimously that the couple was majorly in the wrong.\n\n'It would be a different thing if you were to just sell the drinks at the price you bought them for and break even(Which is still a little tacky),' wrote one. 'But instead, you are charging your friends and family more than the drink is worth in order to make a profit.'\n\n'So you're saying you already have a free venue, food, and entertainment... And also want to make a profit from your guests??' another chimed in.\n\n'They hate the wedding industry, they don't hate the things they sell. They like the things the industry sells, they just don't want to buy them,' snarked another.\n\n'The irony of being \u201cdisgusted by the wedding industry\u201d and yet you\u2019re going to profit off of your guests...pot meet kettle,' said a third.\n\nOthers chimed in to tell the bride that she totally misunderstands the way a cash bar works.\n\n'Cash bar isn't unheard of at a wedding, but it is a deal where you hire someone with a off-site license and they bring and sell their own booze. You HIRE them,' one said.\n\n'You likely don't have the proper licensing to sell alcohol anyway, and would be in a world of hurt (as would your uncle) if anyone was injured because of liquor served at your wedding.'\n\n'[You're the a***hole] for wanting to profit off your guests. They're there to celebrate with you, not to pay for your wedding,' another commenter chided.\n\n'Trying to pay for your wedding by profiting on the alcohol sold there is tacky as f***,' added one more. 'If you care so damn much about saving money, the better move would be to trim that 150 person guest list down.'", "description": "A bride is being slammed on Reddit for saying that she wants to have a cash bar at her wedding - and charge her guests enough for drinks to recoup some of her own wedding costs.", "authors": ["Carly Stern For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/22/19608546-0-image-a-21_1570828642204.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
