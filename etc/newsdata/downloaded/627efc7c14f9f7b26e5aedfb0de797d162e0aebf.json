They\u2019d been brought up by a 1950s mother who said if a man takes you out, you have to say thank you nicely.\n\n\u2018There was a sense of total entitlement by men that hadn\u2019t changed for hundreds of years.\u2019\n\nMiss Nicholson, whose book, How Was It For You, examines the sexual revolution of the 1960s, added: \u2018If you take women down off their pedestal and make them available to men in the way which was happening in the mid-1960s, there are dangers to that, in this availability, not being able to say no, not feeling as if they had the right to say no.\n\n\u2018For men, it was like \"Oh my gosh, we\u2019re so lucky. We seem to be growing up at a time when it was like an eat-as-much-as-you-like buffet, that you could have as much as you liked\".\u2019\n\nMiss Purves told how women pressured into sex also faced the risk of infections. She said: \u2018There was a presumption you were on the pill, nothing mattered. No-one thought about STIs.\u2019\n\nMiss Nicholson replied: \u2018You\u2019d take a few antibiotics and you were back on the game.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s about tiny, wide-eyed, leggy bambini who couldn\u2019t fight back. It\u2019s about disempowerment. The big eyes, the Biba pouts, looking like a Lolita, like a child,\u2019 Virginia Nicholson said. Pictured, model Jean Shrimpton poses at a dolls hospital in London in 1964\n\nResearching her book, she said she found a lot of the 1960s\u2019 culture and even fashion such as miniskirts was \u2018all about availability\u2019.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s about tiny, wide-eyed, leggy bambini who couldn\u2019t fight back. It\u2019s about disempowerment. The big eyes, the Biba pouts, looking like a Lolita, like a child,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018Every girl who could get away with it is trying to look not only under the voting age but under the age of consent.\u2019\n\nBut, comparing the situation with the sexual culture of today, Miss Purves - who came of age in the 1960s - said: \u2018Most of the (1960s) women (still) thought it was love.\n\n\u2018I think the hook-up culture that women are buying into now, I think that would have shocked some people in the 1960s, actually.\u2019", "description": "Virginia Nicholson said women in the 1960s still believed sex was intertwined with love and would be 'shocked' at today's casual 'hook-up' culture using apps such as Tinder.", "authors": ["Richard Marsden For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/01/19468592-0-image-a-48_1570580604004.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
