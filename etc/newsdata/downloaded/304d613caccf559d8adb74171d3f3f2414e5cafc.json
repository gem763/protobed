PPI data is often looked to as a gauge of U.S. producer prices. Core producer prices are expected to have risen 0.2% from July and 2.2% from last year, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cThe PPI index shows few signs of domestic producers taking advantage of any additional pricing power due to tariffs,\u201d Wells Fargo wrote in a note Friday. \u201cPPI inflation has eased over the past year, with the headline index slowing to a 1.7% rate. Underscoring that softness, our preferred measure of core PPI inflation, which excludes food, energy and trade services (measured as margins), fell for the first time last month in nearly four years.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile pot company Aurora Cannabis (ACB) is the only major name scheduled to report quarterly results after the market close Wednesday.
