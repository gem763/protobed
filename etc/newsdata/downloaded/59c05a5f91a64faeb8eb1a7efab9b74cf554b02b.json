Indonesia's future capital in the forest", "language": "en", "text": "SEMBOJA, Indonesia (Reuters) - By day, the unforgiving sun glares off the road beside Ipah\u2019s wooden home with blinding brightness as a passing motorbike stirs a swirl of dust.\n\nBy night, the beams of an occasional truck carrying coal or palm fruits pierce the darkness.\n\nThis remote corner of Indonesia is set to be transformed from a forest backwater on the island of Borneo to a global city - a new capital of a country whose 260 million people make it the world\u2019s fourth most populous.\n\nAt her stall serving ice tea and instant noodles, Ipah, an 18-year-old single mother, worries about what the change will bring.\n\n\u201cCities in Kalimantan are peaceful and safe,\u201d said Ipah, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, referring to the Indonesian part of Borneo island.\n\n\u201cThe capital is a city that never sleeps. Too much smoke, too much fuss.\u201d\n\nThe capital Jakarta\u2019s reputation as a crowded, polluted mega city of more than 10 million people - one that is slowly sinking into the sea - is partly why Indonesia plans to move government offices to a \u201cForest City\u201d in East Kalimantan province.\n\nThe logic of the plan, first mooted nearly 70 years ago, is also to escape Java\u2019s earthquake risk and to swing Indonesia\u2019s political center nearer the middle of the archipelago and away from the politically dominant island.\n\n\u201cWithin five years, we think there will be 200,000 to 300,000 people. Within 10 years, maybe the population will reach 1 million. And then after that 1.5 million,\u201d Planning Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro told Reuters in Jakarta.\n\n(Graphics: Proposed new capital for Indonesia click, tmsnrt.rs/2YNTDai)\n\n\u201cWe will manage the growth of the city so that it doesn\u2019t wildly expand out of control,\u201d he said.\n\nThe vision set out in glossy presentations for a $33 billion city is inspired by the good management of Seoul, the greenness of Singapore and Washington\u2019s separation of administration from business, he said.\n\nThe site of the new capital is about 1,300 km (800 miles) northeast of Jakarta.\n\nReuters reporters traveled more than 280 km (175 miles) across the designated area, the thinly populated forested region of North Penajam Paser and Kutai Kartanegara, between the existing cities of Balikpapan and Samarinda.\n\nLONG-STANDING DREAM\n\nBy identifying the site for the yet-to-be-named capital last week, President Joko Widodo - known as Jokowi - got closer than ever to realizing a move now set to start in 2024.\n\n\u201cOur people are grateful, Alhamdulilah (praise be to God),\u201d said Abdul Gafur Mas\u2019ud, regent of North Penajam Paser. \u201cThis regency has been considered undeveloped.\u201d\n\nThe congratulatory bouquets arrayed at his office are as bright as the mood in town since the decision.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A worker pushes a trolley next to a park decoration at Sultan Aji Muhammad Sulaiman Sepinggan International Airport in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan province, Indonesia, August 28, 2019. REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan\n\nMany residents spoke of their hopes for better schools and paved roads, for clean, piped water and reliable electricity.\n\nBut after initial celebrations, worries are also surfacing that land speculation will drive up prices, and over an influx of outsiders competing for jobs and over environmental destruction.\n\nThe potential for massive corruption is also not lost on Indonesians given experiences with new capitals everywhere from Brazil\u2019s Brasilia to Myanmar\u2019s Naypyidaw with its vast projects and still largely empty highways.\n\n\u201cOur people must prepare quickly,\u201d said Awang Yacoub Luthman, secretary of the Kutai Kartanegara Ing Martadipura Sultanate, who has migration at the top of his list of worries.\n\nEast Kalimantan touts its openness to religions other than Islam as well as its welcome for outsiders. In fact, many residents are descendants of Javanese settlers who came to the coal mining and palm oil growing region in the 1970s.\n\nBut the new planned relocation is on a different scale.\n\nLAND WORRIES\n\nThe region\u2019s Tribun Kaltim newspaper said asking prices for land surged four times after the announcement.\n\nThat said, Bagus Susetyo, local chairman of the Real Estate Indonesia property association, told Reuters major property companies were not acquiring land because they had large land banks in nearby Balikpapan.\n\nWhile some would gain from the rise in land prices, many Indonesians don\u2019t own the land they live on.\n\nAmong them is Ipah, who is already resigned to losing her dwelling, protected against bad luck by two diamond-shaped charms woven from young coconut leaves.\n\n\u201cMr Jokowi, can you give me free land, even just a square meter or a free house?\u201d she asked.\n\nIt is not only human homes at risk.\n\nEast Kalimantan is known for forests inhabited by orangutans, sun bears and long-nosed monkeys.\n\nThere will be no building in protected forest and the government plans to reforest abandoned mines and illegal palm oil plantations, Planning Minister Brodjonegoro said.\n\nHe floated the idea of an orangutan conservation center similar to one for giant pandas in the Chinese city of Chengdu.\n\nThe fate of the apes is particularly sensitive in Indonesia given that they have become symbols for campaigners targeting the world\u2019s biggest palm oil industry over the destruction of forests for plantations.\n\nConservationists said they were far from convinced that there would be no spillover effects from moving the capital to East Kalimantan.\n\nSlideshow (23 Images)\n\n\u201cThe city center might be located quite far away,\u201d said Aldrianto Priadjati, an executive of the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation, which is based in Kutai Kartanegara.\n\n\u201cBut the development will be everywhere, just like - sorry to say it - Jakarta.\u201d", "description": "By day, the unforgiving sun glares off the road beside Ipah's wooden home with blinding brightness as a passing motorbike stirs a swirl of dust.", "authors": ["Tabita Diela", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1425963107&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8303E"}
