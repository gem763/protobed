A better search system is the top feature request the company gets from creators, according to YouTube\u2019s blog post on the subject published earlier today. The new filtering options now list include:\n\nResponse status: has the creator already responded to this comment?\n\nhas the creator already responded to this comment? Contains question: does the comment contain a question?\n\ndoes the comment contain a question? Subscriber count: does the commenter have at least 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, one million, or 10 million subscribers?\n\ndoes the commenter have at least 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, one million, or 10 million subscribers? Subscriber status: is the commenter publicly subscribed to the creator?\n\nis the commenter publicly subscribed to the creator? Member status: is the commenter a member?\n\nYouTube currently has a filter system in place, but it\u2019s not quite as powerful. For example, a common frustration the company has dealt with in the past is the limited use of keyword searching. \u201cPreviously, searching by keyword only showed you comments with an exact match (so searching \u2018subs\u2019 would only find \u2018subs\u2019),\u201d the blog post reads. \u201cWith this update, you\u2019ll see search results beyond exact match (so now you\u2019ll also see \u2018subscriber\u2019 or \u2018subscribers\u2019 for that same search).\u201d\n\nTrying to work within YouTube\u2019s busy comments section is still difficult, and the company is working on adding more options to the filtering system. Previous examples of features that were added to comment filtering included creator hearts, which allows YouTubers to like people\u2019s comments, top comment pinning, and giving creators control over comment review.", "description": "YouTube has introduced an updated filtering system for managing comment sections, with the goal of making it easier for creators to find questions and separate comments by subscriber count.", "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y8oJLLnPxg8oX2C_akYE_seaIEI=/0x86:1200x714/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16326581/youtube.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
