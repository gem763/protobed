A coroner was told how the investigation conducted by authorities on the south Asian island \u201cdid not sit right\u201d and contained various inconsistencies.\n\nIt was suggested by a tuk-tuk driver, who took the men in the early hours of 13 May from the Cleopatra nightclub in the centre of Colombo back to their accommodation at the nearby Kingsbury Hotel, that they had asked for heroin.\n\nThe inquest heard how the driver introduced them to a man, who supplied them with seven bags of brown sugar obtained from a drug dealer.\n\nDC Phil McElhone of Durham police, who investigated their deaths, said \u201csomething does not sit right\u201d with the account of their deaths given by witnesses, and that the two rugby players may not have known what they were taking.\n\nHe said that, as well as the issue of the men clearly not being drug users, there were inconsistencies in terms of timings, the volume of the drug and the amount the men paid.\n\nThe coroner, Crispin Oliver, said the men purchased the drug on the way home from the nightclub. He said: \u201cThey had no prior knowledge of this substance. They would not have known that it was heroin.\n\n\u201cI am satisfied that these were not drug users, I think this was a one-off occasion, it was certainly a mistake and it was certainly an accident.\u201d\n\nCrispin added: \u201cI hope this serves as a warning to people when they travel to far parts of the world that they have to be very careful about what they are encouraged to purchase and take.\u201d\n\nThe inquest heard how the men travelled to Sri Lanka with the rest of their team on 9 May and had taken part in a match with the Ceylonese rugby team on 12 May, before going out to the nightclub.\n\nWitnesses said Howard, 25, appeared to be \u201cmuch changed in his demeanour\u201d when he returned to the hotel and was seen stumbling around before going to bed.\n\nBaty, 26, stayed up a little longer and with teammates and \u201cseemed a little bit drunk\u201d. The men were found unresponsive in their rooms later that morning.\n\nDuring the inquest, Paul Baty, the father of Thomas Baty, said his son graduated with a law degree from Northumbria University. He said: \u201cHe enjoyed his friends, he enjoyed enjoying himself, he enjoyed rugby.\n\n\u201cEven though he was a big fellow and seemed to be the heart and soul, he was actually very sensitive at heart.\u201d\n\nHoward\u2019s father, Robert, said of his son: \u201cThomas was a quiet lad. Once you got to know him, he was considerate, caring - he would look after you.\u201d\n\nOliver paid tribute to the men and praised both families for attending the inquest.", "description": "Thomas Howard and Thomas Baty were found unresponsive after night out in Sri Lankan capital", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74fbe19de5e023cdafed62c87dbab72401483b12/0_0_2072_1243/master/2072.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a0a5a6b10023e39db7a8bf2e4cfc6b89"}
