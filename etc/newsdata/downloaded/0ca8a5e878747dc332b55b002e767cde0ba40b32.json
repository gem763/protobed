Maybe that idea has gone under the cardboard bus as well as Boris. I, for one, cannot stand more months of this pissing about. It\u2019s affecting my mental health, and probably [that of] many others in the country. Call a second referendum and scrap this bill. How can any of this possibly be better than where we are now? The government has proposed no financial, economic and wellbeing benefits for leaving the EU in this state. AnotherAlan\n\n\u2018Risks have to be taken to try to avert catastrophe\u2019\n\nThis may seal Boris\u2019s fate. The EU looks [prepared] to grant the extension now because there will be nothing to stop the vote of no confidence and a GE [general election]. The outcome of that is obviously uncertain, but in this situation, risks have to be taken to try to avert catastrophe. PowerlessAngryVictim\n\n\u2018It\u2019s wrong on so many levels\u2019\n\nCannot believe that 19 Labour MPs voted for Boris\u2019s deal and didn\u2019t vote for Theresa\u2019s deal, which did legally protect workers. It\u2019s wrong on so many levels. ADH1969\n\n\u2018As a voter you would have no idea what you would be getting by voting Labour\u2019\n\nIt is noble of Labour to say they respect diversity of opinion and Labour MPs can vote as they like, but what is the voter supposed to think about all this? If you stand for anything and everything, you stand for nothing. And you will get nothing done as a consequence. Labour should at the very least try to agree on the basics \u2013 do they support a referendum on the deal, do they support workers\u2019 rights, do they support the environment, do they stand up for job creation and social equality, etc. Once you agree on the principles, it should be easy to vote on the content of the bill. You know what you stand for and you check the bill if it is aligned to that. Alas, Labour is all over the place and hence a complete chaos. As a voter, you would have no idea what you would be getting by voting Labour. curiosity19\n\n\u2018I now appreciate the wisdom of Scotland\u2019s court of session\u2019\n\nI think I now fully appreciate the wisdom of Scotland\u2019s court of session in keeping that sword of Damocles dangling over Boris Johnson\u2019s head. SporadicWit\n\n\u2018Johnson has backed himself into his own corner\u2019\n\nBoris Johnson has backed himself into his own corner with all his ridiculous rhetoric. If he were a proper adult rather than a five-year-old in adult clothes, he would simply allow enough time for proper debate about his deal. Why is that such a problem? He might have to accept a few amendments, but that happens to every government. He has just made error after error since becoming PM. It\u2019s not clever to get rid of 21 [members] of your party. And as for the ERG [European Research Group] complaining about MPs voting against the government \u2013 the pot calling the kettle black \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t be in this situation if they had voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal. barriecooper\n\n\u2018Overall a good night for Labour\u2019\n\nDon\u2019t worry about Labour MPs voting against the whip. It was only the second reading. These MPs can now demonstrate that they supported their constituents. If it does progress, judge them on their efforts to make amendments and their votes on the third reading \u2013 if it happens. Overall, a good night for Labour, Bonzo [Johnson] delayed his own Brexit bill and [Lisa] Nandy, [Dan] Jarvis et al now have the freedom to support amendments. Suck that one up, [Dominic] Cummings. YorksTyke\n\n\u2018This is rapidly disappearing up its own backside\u2019\n\nAs someone who has followed this keenly over the past few years, I don\u2019t feel much shame in admitting I\u2019ve found many elements of the past few days confusing. Not so much the procedures, but trying to understand tactics on all sides. I\u2019m convinced a general election will give another hung parliament. In turn, that gives little chance of agreement, a second referendum or revocation. Just more delay. This is rapidly disappearing up its own backside.
