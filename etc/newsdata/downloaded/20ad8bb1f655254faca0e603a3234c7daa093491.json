Pennsylvania, which Trump narrowly won in 2016, would be a crucial state to win in the next presidential election; Trump apparently has seen his pro-industry policies as a path toward winning it, and his reelection, once again.\n\nThe president railed against a ban on fracking \u2013 which had the support of many Democrats seeking to unseat him in 2020 \u2013 arguing that the controversial method of extracting natural gas brought wealth to rural and downtrodden areas and will create a boom in construction jobs throughout the state.\n\n\"My job is to represent to people of Pittsburgh, not the people of Paris,\" Trump said, resurfacing a line he used previously.\n\nThe politics surrounding the oil and gas industry in Pennsylvania, however, has not been as clean as Trump said the pipelines will be.\n\nIn the suburbs that might be key to his path to victory, Pennsylvania voters have shown a growing opposition to the drilling and massive pipelines required to move its product across the state. Candidates in state and local races increasingly have been hardening their stances on the industry. National polling showed growing skepticism of fracking, the process used in extraction.\n\nWhile the issue is unlikely to have a game-changing effect on the race already dominated by Trump's strong personality, a looming impeachment fight and accusations of racism, Trump's eagerness to promote the industry underscored his tight focus on shoring up his base of rural voters, even at the risk of alienating others.\n\n\"Today, I'm proud to declare that I've delivered on every single promise I made to this conference three years ago and much, much more,\" Trump said.\n\nSeveral Democrats seeking the White House have taken their own political risks on the issue. Backed by environmentalists on the left, soe candidates\u2014 including Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2014 have broken from the party's past support for fracking to call for a nationwide ban. More centrist candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden, have declined to go that far.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBiden, who also was in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, openly criticized Trump, saying the policies he espoused hurt those very same blue-collar workers the president was courting later in the day.\n\nBiden cast the wealthy president as a charlatan populist whose tax policies, economic stewardship and overall erratic leadership style has hurt U.S. workers.\n\n\"This administration has no idea what hard-working, decent, ordinary Americans are going through,\" Biden said during a speech in his hometown of Scranton.\n\nBiden has argued that he could reassemble Obama's winning coalition by winning back some working-class white voters who sided with Trump while reversing Democrats' decline from 2012 among nonwhite voters in cities such as Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Hours after announcing a \u201cpermanent cease-fire\u201d between Turkey and the Kurds in Syria, President Trump focused on domestic matters during a speech Wednesday\u00a0in Pittsburgh where he touted his administration\u2019s moves to deregulate the oil and gas industries in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania.", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/23/694940094001_6096967786001_6096972061001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
