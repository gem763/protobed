It offers a look behind the scenes and exhaustively documents how he came to report on the dozens of sexual harassment allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein, despite myriad obstacles.\n\nFarrow had been working on investigative reports for NBC, including a series about the \u201cdark side\u201d of Hollywood, and Weinstein\u2019s name kept coming up. Within the first 80 pages of this 414-page tome, it becomes clear why this apparently open secret failed to gain traction in either law enforcement or among journalists who previously tried to report on it. As an example, the NYPD had worked with an accuser and obtained a taped confession that Weinstein groped her, and yet, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office chose not to press charges. Farrow documents how various members of Weinstein\u2019s legal team made significant campaign contributions to that same DA. Equally troubling, Farrow\u2019s bosses, who began getting persistent phone calls from Weinstein, advise Farrow to \u201cgive it a rest\u201d and work on other stories. Given the extensive detail Farrow provides about these interactions throughout the book, it is difficult to believe NBC\u2019s blanket denial over Farrow\u2019s version of events.\n\nFarrow makes a compelling case that, beyond bowing to pressure from an influential studio head, NBC may have shied away from the story because several of its executives and personalities, including \u201cToday\u201d co-host Matt Lauer, also had sexual harassment allegations in their closets. The Weinstein story was just the tip of the iceberg that began to reveal how prominent men in various industries used their positions of power to sexually harass women and face no consequences.\n\n\u201cCatch and Kill\u201d is part \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d part spy thriller (the book cover evokes a noir motif), with a dash of the personal mixed in. We learn that Farrow sought the advice of his sister Dylan, who has long alleged their father Woody Allen sexually abused her as a child, in how to approach potential victims. Rose McGowan, the first victim who spoke to him about her rape allegation against Weinstein, said she felt she could trust him because of an op-ed he had written about Dylan.\n\nWe learn that Allen had hired private detectives to trail law enforcement officials who were investigating him, a \u201ccampaign to disrupt the investigators,\u201d and charges were ultimately dropped. Farrow shows how Weinstein employed similar tactics, hiring an Israeli firm to track and investigate his accusers, Farrow and others. Farrow gets a sense that he\u2019s being followed and multiple sources urge him to be careful; this is when the book starts to sound more like a novel. Farrow puts copies of his reporting and the evidence in a safety deposit box, should anything happen to him. As he gets closer to publishing the story, Farrow moves out of his apartment into a friend\u2019s \u201csafe house.\u201d\n\nThe book is utterly disheartening in its revelation of widespread abuses and cover-ups, the leverage of power and money to evade accountability and the many lives that were devastated in the process.\n\nFarrow, who won the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting, closes with this note of hope and warning: \u201cIn the end, the courage of women can\u2019t be stamped out. And stories - the big ones, the true ones - can be caught but never killed.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"Catch and Kill,\" Little, Brown and Co., by Ronan Farrow", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rasha Madkour"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/22/book_review_-_catch_and_kill_71532_c0-860-1938-1990_s1200x700.jpg?ba9a620f3a928d61c0d0673bc25bf56a8ddfcead", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
