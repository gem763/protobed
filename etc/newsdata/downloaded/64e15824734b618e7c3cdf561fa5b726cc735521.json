SoftBank\u2019s Saudi Arabia-backed Vision Fund, which invested alongside Mr Son\u2019s company in earlier funding rounds, is not expected to contribute to the financing.\n\nWeWork would abandon its dual-class share structure, which at one point gave Mr Neumann 20 times the voting power of other shareholders, under the SoftBank proposal, four people briefed on the plan said. Those voting rights, as well as a series of deals Mr Neumann conducted with the company, emerged as a big source of concern for investors when the group was preparing for its IPO.\n\nMr Neumann currently controls an economic stake of just over 20 per cent in an investment vehicle with his co-founder Miguel McKelvey. Those voting rights were cut to three times those of ordinary shares when Mr Neumann was ousted as chief executive last month.\n\nThe rescue deal also involves a tender of up to $US3 billion for shares held by WeWork\u2019s existing shareholders, including Mr Neumann, who would agree to sell part of his holding to Mr Son\u2019s group, one of the people said. Reuters reported the size of the tender offer earlier on Monday, CNBC reported that the WeWork board could accept the SoftBank offer as early as Tuesday, and Axios first reported the planned payment to Mr Neumann.\n\nJPMorgan has been pitching its own $US5 billion funding package over the past two weeks and has met roughly 100 institutional investors it hoped would finance the borrowing. The proposal from the Wall Street lender was set to include roughly $US2 billion in unsecured debt, structured as payment-in-kind notes that carried a coupon of 15 per cent.\n\nThe debt in the SoftBank proposal would be on better terms than the debt financing cobbled together by JPMorgan, however, one person briefed on the rival offers said.\n\nThe two offers are set to be formally submitted to the board on Monday and directors are expected to meet on Tuesday to decide which proposal to accept. The company faces a cash crunch by the end of November if it does not secure an injection of new money.\n\nThe price of the company\u2019s bonds rallied on Monday, rising from just over 84 cents on the dollar to a high of almost 86 cents. WeWork and SoftBank declined to comment.\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "Adam Neumann is favouring a $14 billion rescue proposal from his largest investor that would pay him about $US200 million to cede his outsize voting power.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2942%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_32/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6e4e43d9e84f3d44ef5bc83ad5b8307f2c374233", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
