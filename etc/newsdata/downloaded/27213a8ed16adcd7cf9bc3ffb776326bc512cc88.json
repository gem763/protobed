While this might put drivers on edge, there are easy steps you can take to stop you becoming the next victim of a relay theft. Certain metals are capable of blocking key signals, which means if you store your fob with one of these metals around it, criminals won't be able to pick them up and steal your vehicle. The most simple and most ingenious is a metal can. The aluminum in a drinks can will stop radio signals being transmitted from your key and stop burglars in their tracks. Some experts have suggested keeping your keys in the fridge, as the material on the inside will block signals too. If you're looking for a low-cost option, some people wrap their fobs in tin foil - although this isn't endorsed by security firms. Keeping your keys in a small metal box however can work efficiently. Special faraday pouches \u2014 cheap wallets which shield the key's radio signal from being transmitted \u2014 are also useful for storing your keys when you're away from home - in motorway service stations and public car parks. Experts also encourage drivers to keep them at least 5m away from their front door, to give thieves the worst chance of being able to relay a signal. But some security specialists advise against hiding your car keys too obscurely in your house \u2014 because if serious criminals truly want to steal your car, they will break in and do anything to find the keys. Old-fashioned methods like parking in a well-lit area, using a steering wheel lock and installing a proper tracking device to your vehicle are still highly recommended to keep your car safe.\n\nVehicles that have a keyless system employ a very simple process.\n\nThe fobs emit a short-range 'friendly' radio signal that carries only a few yards.\n\nWhen the associated vehicle is close by (usually within a few metres), the car recognises the signal and unlocks the doors.\n\nThieves can intercept this by using an electrical relay system to gain immediate access to the such keyless cars.\n\nThe swift and silent technique is so successful that it's one of the major factors behind car thefts in England a Wales hitting a six-year high last year.\n\nInsurers paid out around \u00a3108million \u2013 or \u00a31.2million a day \u2013 in claims in the first three months of the year, according to the Association of British Insurers.\n\nThis was up 22 per cent on the same period in 2018 and comes as campaigners and politicians call on car companies to improve security, especially for keyless cars.\n\nSo-called 'relay' theft occurs when two (or more) thieves work together. They use equipment to capture electromagnetic signals emitted by keyfobs.\n\nOne thief stands by the car with a transmitter, while the other stands by the house with another, which picks up the signal from the electronic key, usually kept near the front door on a table or hook.\n\nThis is then relayed to the transmitter by the vehicle, causing it to think the key is in close proximity and prompting it to open. Thieves can then drive the vehicle away thanks to the keyless ignition and quickly replace locks and entry devices.\n\nAny vehicle with keyless entry could be vulnerable to relay theft. These include cars from BMW, Ford, Audi, Land Rover, Volkswagen and Mercedes.\n\nIt is not illegal to sell or own a relay box device and the only way police can arrest someone is under the 'going equipped to steal' law \u2014 meaning they would have to catch the thief red-handed with it, or prove an intent to use it for theft.\n\nThe same law applies to other gadgets supposedly designed to help owners who have lost their keys, such as key programmer devices, which tell the car to trust a new key and forget the code for the original one.\n\nBut police sources, security experts and locksmiths specialising in vehicles have all said there is 'no legitimate reason' to be in possession of a relay device.\n\nIf a driver was to lose their key, a relay box wouldn't help them get back into their car, as the devices only work when the key is nearby.\n\nCar manufacturers and service centres would instead use special keys called 'one time use' keys that let them key in a new code for the driver.", "description": "The footage was captured on a doorbell camera outside a house in Rowley Regis, West Midlands, during the middle of the night.
