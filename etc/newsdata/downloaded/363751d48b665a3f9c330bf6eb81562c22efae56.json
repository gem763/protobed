Covering national security. And homeland security. And with many of the same skills I used in the U.S. Army as a public affairs officer. Some would argue that\u2019s propaganda.\u201d CBP officer: \u201cYou\u2019re a journalist?\u201d Watson: \u201cYes.\u201d CBP officer: \u201cYou write propaganda, right?\u201d Watson waited five seconds. Then: \u201cFor the purposes of expediting this conversation, yes.\u201d CBP officer, a fourth time: \u201cYou write propaganda, right?\u201d Watson, again: \u201cFor the purposes of expediting this conversation, yes.\u201d CBP officer: \u201cHere you go.\u201d\n\nWatson has since filed a civil rights complaint, and a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told Defense One that the agency\u2019s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties is reviewing information on the interaction.\n\nIn a statement to HuffPost, a CBP spokesperson told said it is \u201caware of the allegation posed by a Defense One editor about an officer\u2019s alleged inappropriate conduct at Washington Dulles International airport and we are investigating the allegation.\u201d\n\n\u201cCBP officers take an Oath of Office, a solemn pledge that conveys great responsibility and one that should be carried out at all times with the utmost professionalism,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cWe hold our employees accountable to our core values of vigilance, integrity and service to country, and do not tolerate inappropriate comments or behavior by our employees.\u201d\n\nWatson told HuffPost he doesn\u2019t know what prompted the agent\u2019s line of questioning.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is this was not normal,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cit wasn\u2019t like any previous episode\u201d he\u2019d ever had with a homeland security employee.\n\nSince coming forward with his story, Watson said he has heard from dozens of individuals, both men and women, who have had similar experiences of what he described as \u201cbullying behavior.\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard from a lot more people since this happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI have come to the opinion at least so far that this is a good thing\u201d that people are sharing their stories.\n\nIn February, BuzzFeed News reported that CBP apologized to one of its journalists after an agent aggressively questioned him at New York City\u2019s JFK Airport over his coverage of President Donald Trump.\n\nBritish journalist James Dyer said in an August Twitter thread that he was stopped by a CBP agent who accused him of being a member of the \u201cfake news media\u201d at Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nDHS did not immediately return HuffPost\u2019s request for comment on Thursday\u2019s incident.", "description": "The officer reportedly asked the question four times before handing back the man's passport.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d98e4832100005000317664.jpeg?cache=ezmqzubze1&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
