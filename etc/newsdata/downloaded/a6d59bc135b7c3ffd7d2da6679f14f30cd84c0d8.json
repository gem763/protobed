The National Bonsai Foundation offers classes in such things as tai chi, yoga and meditation. (John Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nWhen bonsai experts describe one of their miniature creations, they don\u2019t talk about when it was planted. They talk about how long it\u2019s been \u201cin training.\u201d That\u2019s the year the painstaking process of grooming the tree began.\n\nNick Gracenin has been in training since 1977. That\u2019s when he started learning tai chi. Six years later, he started teaching it. And on a recent Saturday morning he was teaching it in a bonsai-filled courtyard at the National Arboretum.\n\n\u201cI encourage you to use the shady areas,\u201d Nick said to the 30 or so people who had gathered at the National Bonsai & Penjing Museum. Some were beginners. Some had taken classes with Nick before. One woman was dressed in shiny blue silks: flowing pants and a Mandarin-collared shirt.\n\nA butterfly floated past. A hummingbird hovered. There was the sound of water from a fountain, inside of which rested a bonsai bougainvillea \u2014 \u201cin training\u201d since 1985, its fuchsia flowers in bloom.\n\n\u201cRelaxing isn\u2019t something you make happen,\u201d said Nick, 60. \u201cRather, it\u2019s something you allow to happen.\u201d\n\nEasy enough for him to say. Have you tried relaxing lately? The planet\u2019s boiling. Guns are everywhere. The president keeps tweeting.\n\n\n\nVisitors to the National Arboretum in Washington, D.C., admire some of the trees at the arboretum\u2019s National Bonsai & Penjing Museum. (John Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d Nick said. \u201cFeel your heart rate slow down.\u201d\n\nI learned that morning that \u201ctai chi\u201d is actually pronounced \u201ctie ji.\u201d And \u201cbonsai\u201d is closer to \u201cbone-sigh.\u201d The tai chi classes are organized by the National Bonsai Foundation, along with a bunch of other offerings: yoga, meditation, forest bathing (described as the Japanese practice of \u201cmeditation, rejuvenation and contemplation\u201d amid the bonsai)\u2026.\n\nMany are followed by a private tour of the arboretum\u2019s collection of bonsai and penjing, penjing being the Chinese progenitor of the Japanese bonsai. (Tickets to the classes range from $15 to $35. Visit bonsai-nbf.org for details.)\n\n\u201cOpen your eyes,\u201d Nick said. \u201cHow do you feel? Lots of smiles. Good.\u201d\n\nExcept for seeing it in movies, or catching a glimpse of senior citizens in a park, I\u2019d never experienced tai chi before. It was harder than it looked, requiring a posture \u2014 knees slightly bent, back slightly curled \u2014 that I found difficult. I prefer to lock all my joints rigidly in place, as if they were Tinkertoys.\n\n\n\nA bonsai tree stands at the entrance to the National Arboretum\u2019s Bonsai & Penjing Museum in Washington, D.C. (John Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\nBut I learned that doesn\u2019t work in tai chi.\n\nNick described various elements of Chinese exercise: the breath and energy work of qi gong; the calisthenics of tao yin; the \u201cpolarity boxing\u201d of tai chi chuan.\n\nChinese medicine, Nick said, is all about circulation: moving it, smoothing it, equaling it out.\n\n\u201cThink of it like water flowing,\u201d he said. \u201cWater is the stuff of life. If water is stagnant, it becomes smelly.\u201d\n\nTai chi, he explained, is about polarity, the idea of positive and negative poles and finding the balance between them.\n\n\u201cWe could use more of that,\u201d Nick said.\n\nSounds good to me.\n\nI called Nick up a few days later to hear what it\u2019s like to seek balance in this most partisan of towns. He grew up in western Pennsylvania, north of Pittsburgh. When Nick taught tai chi there, joint injuries and back problems were the physical ailments he heard about most often from his students.\n\n\u201cHere, the two biggest complaints have always been, \u2018I don\u2019t sleep well\u2019 and \u2018I can\u2019t seem to relax.\u2019\u201d\n\nWashington is full of hyper-driven, Type-A people who, Nick said, ameliorate their lack of relaxation in two ways: \u201cYou binge watch TV till your brain fries or you drink a lot to get your mind off whatever\u2019s bothering you. The problem is, eventually you have to face whatever it is that\u2019s bothering you if you want to resolve it.\u201d\n\nHear that, Congress?\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you let go of it completely, but you need balance in your life,\u201d Nick said. \u201cI have as much stress in my life as anyone else does. I think my practice has been something that\u2019s really helped me through challenges that have come my way.\u201d\n\nThe National Arboretum\u2019s bonsai and penjing collection dates to 1976, its core component a Bicentennial gift of 53 trees from Japan. The oldest tree \u2014 a Japanese white pine \u2014 has been in training since 1625.\n\nIt was in the nursery of the Yamaki family of Hiroshima, Japan, on Aug. 6, 1945, the day the United States dropped on atomic bomb on the city.\n\nThe tree, behind a garden wall, survived. So did the family.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s both inspiring and beautiful,\u201d Nick said of the tree. \u201cTo look at it and then be able to practice tai chi alongside it is a little mind-blowing the first time.\u201d\n\nThe little tree survived that cataclysm. Here\u2019s hoping we can survive ours.\n\nTwitter: @johnkelly\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.", "description": "Washington isn\u2019t the most relaxing of places.
