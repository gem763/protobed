Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee.\n\nLast week, the White House sent a letter to Mrs. Pelosi warning her that it wouldn\u2019t cooperate with the impeachment probe until she held a full House vote to authorize and establish equal powers for both parties.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is centered on allegations that Mr. Trump, with the help of his personal lawyer Rudolph Giuliani, attempted to pressure Ukraine into investigating political rival and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nMs. Hill is the first in a series of other State Department officials set to appear before lawmakers this week, including Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who was blocked by the administration from testifying last week but has since decided to honor the House committees\u2019 subpoena.\n\nDespite the administration\u2019s refusal to comply, lawmakers also secured testimony from former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch last week.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
