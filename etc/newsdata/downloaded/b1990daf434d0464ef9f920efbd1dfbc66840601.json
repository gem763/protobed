Because while the Z6 and Z7 are great cameras, they\u2019cost around $3,000 and $5,000 respectively, which isn\u2019t really what you\u2019d call affordable. The Z50 is here to answer that question.\n\nIn contrast to Canon\u2019s approach to creating the more affordable but still full-frame EOS-RP mirroless camera, Nikon opted to go with the same scheme it\u2019s used with its DSLR cameras. Instead of a full-frame sensor, the has Z50 a 20.9-MP DX sensor (which is more commonly called APS-C outside of Nikon land).\n\nPhoto: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo\n\nSo while the Z50's image quality might not be quite as good as what you get from the Z6/Z7, its smaller sensor allows for a much more compact body. The Z50 weighs in at 400g, compared to the 675g Nikon Z6.\n\nBoth the Z50 and the Z6/Z7 feature Nikon\u2019s Z-mount, which means all three cameras can use the same set of interchangeable lenses Nikon has been rolling out since its Z-series launch last fall.\n\nDespite its smaller dimensions, the Z50 still has a solid design including a magnesium-alloy frame and a sizable grip that makes it easy to hold. That said, the Z50 doesn\u2019t have the same level of rain and weather resistance of its full-frame siblings. (Nikon says the Z50's water resistance is closer to what you get on the D5600.)\n\nPhoto: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo Unlike the Nikon Z6/Z7, the Z50 features a smaller 20.9-MP DX-sized sensor.

The Z50 the first Z-series camera to have a built-in pop-up flash, and its rear 3.2-inch touchscreen can also be flipped 180-degrees downward, so you can use it to check your framing and composition when you\u2019re filming yourself.\n\nNikon even claims it\u2019s designed a special tripod that can take the place of Joby\u2019s ubiquitous GorillaPod without blocking the screen, though I haven\u2019t had a chance to check it out yet.\n\nOther top-line specs include continuous shooting at up to 11 fps, 209 phase-detect autofocus points with Nikon\u2019s Eye-Detection AF, and 4K UHD video recording at up to 30 FPS (along with a 120 FPS slow-mo mode). The Z50 also sports a mic in jack for better audio recording, although you don\u2019t get a dedicated headphone out jack like you do on the Z6/Z7.\n\nThe Z50 also comes with a timelapse mode that can merge photos in the camera, along with 20 creative filters that you can see in real-time for both stills and video. Unfortunately, while I did get a chance to handle the new Z50, I wasn\u2019t able to take any photo samples, so we\u2019ll have to wait a bit longer to see how the Z50's photos look.\n\nPhoto: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo If you think $US8,000 ($11,830) is too much to spend on a lens, then the Noct is probably not for you.

The Z50 is available in one of two kits: a $1,799.95 kit that includes a Nikkor Z DX 16-50mm f/3.5-6.3 lens, or a $2,099.95 kit with the 16-50mm lens and a Nikkor DX Z 50-250mm f/4.5-6.3 lens. The Nikon Z50 will be available starting in November.\n\nFinally, for anyone who has been waiting for the super high-end 58mm f/0.95 Noct lens Nikon announced last year, Nikon announced that it will be available on October 31 for a staggering $US8,000 ($11,830).\n\nEditor's Note: Australian pricing and availability is yet to be confirmed.\n\nDesigned as the ultimate low-light lens for tasks like astrophotography, Nikon claims its new Noct lens is the fastest, sharpest lens the company has ever made. It\u2019s manual focus only, supports 5-axis image stabilisation, and comes with a built-in focus assist button and an onboard display.", "description": "After launching the Z6 and Z7 last year, the next thing people wanted to know is how Nikon planned to expand its new family of mirrorless cameras so that more people could buy them.
