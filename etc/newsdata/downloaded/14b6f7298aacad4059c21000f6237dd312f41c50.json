Community service, fines, yes. But prison time, no. My heart goes out to Felicity, Bill Macy and their family.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone involved in the college fraud cases should go to prison.

A woman who used her wealth and influence to try and bump a deserving kid from a crucial spot at a prestigious university? A godless cheater who taught her daughter it was okay to cheat if you have enough wealth and fame?\n\nAnd why is Baldwin singling out college fraud as a white collar crime that should never come with a prison sentence? It\u2019s nonsensical. Does he have a reason for this \u2014 I mean, other than Famous people like me have been caught doing it?\n\nThere are all kinds of terrible reasons to send someone to prison. You should not be sentencing people to the slammer for revenge, or to send a message, or even deterrence. A prison sentence should be about one thing: the individual criminal paying society back for the crime committed. Sorry, but sentencing a wealthy woman to a fine, sentencing a working actress, who probably has a lot of time on her hands, to community service, just isn\u2019t enough.\n\nNor, in my opinion is 14 days.\n\nAt the very least, Huffman should be serving at least six months. When freedom is only two weeks away\u2026 Come on, a 14 day prison sentence is hardly enough time to ponder the fact you\u2019ve lost your freedom. I would not have sentenced her to more than 18 months, but six months is the minimum, a sentence that would force her to have to get used to a prison lifestyle and to despair over the fact that this real life for a while.\n\nBut I remain curious over why Baldwin, of all white collar crimes, wants to shield college cheating from any kind of prison sentence.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
