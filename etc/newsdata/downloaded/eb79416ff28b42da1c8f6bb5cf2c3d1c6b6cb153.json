For comparison, the report said, deals valued at under $1 million comprised more than 60% of angel and seed deals 5 years ago. Through September, that percentage had shifted, with more than half being valued at over that mark.\n\n\"The venture industry has gone through many shifts in recent years; it can be argued that the angel & seed stage has seen the most drastic divergence from past investment theses, rendering the classic definition of 'seed' outdated,\" the report said.\n\nRead More: Startups with women founders are on track to see record venture investment in 2019\n\nPartly to blame are investors themselves, the report found, because they expect companies to be farther along in their development at earlier stages. What used to be considered a Series A-startup, with a minimum viable product and a growing team, now is considered a seed round, the report argued.\n\nBut the looming presence of SoftBank's massive Vision Fund is another driving force behind the record-breaking early funding. The $100 billion fund has started dabbling in early-stage investing in addition to taking major stakes in startups like WeWork, and early investors are starting to feel the pressure as they compete with that kind of cash.\n\n\"I guarantee you for every company out there, there's an investor who is interested in it,\" Austin-based BuildGroup general partner Klee Kleber told Business Insider.\n\nAlthough BuildGroup is somewhat insulated from the deal-making craze in Silicon Valley, Kleber said it wasn't unusual for the hype to make its way to Texas and other fast-growing tech hubs. This puts smaller firms and smaller ecosystems at a disadvantage because they simply cannot compete with the massive injections of cash coming from the east and west coasts, especially in the earliest stages of a company's lifecycle, he said.", "description": "The average amount of a seed and angel round so far in 2019 reached an all-time high of $2 million, according to the report.", "authors": ["Megan Hernbroth"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5cf527eb11e20506fa0e9326?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
