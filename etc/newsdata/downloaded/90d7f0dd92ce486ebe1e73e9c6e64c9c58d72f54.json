(AP) - Sixteen-year-old Delaney Johnston, of Lead, said she felt an \u201coverwhelming sense of joy\u201d sweep over her when she stepped on stage last month to become the youngest-ever inductee into the South Dakota Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nAnd what she\u2019s demonstrated so far in her short life and brief country music career suggests nothing less than an overwhelming sense of accomplishment.\n\n\u201cWhen I first got the call I was very shocked because I totally wasn\u2019t expecting it,\u201d Johnston said of her notification to join the class of 2019 inductees. \u201cWhen I was up on stage accepting the award, I had this overwhelming sense of joy.\u201d\n\nChair of the South Dakota Country Music Hall of Fame Board of Directors Wini Iverson said she has been following Johnston\u2019s career for a long time and first saw her sing with Sherwin and Pam Linton several years ago.\n\n\u201cShe impressed me with her ability to sing with such a high-quality show at such a young age,\u201d Iverson told the Black Hills Pioneer. \u201cDelaney has made great strides in her musical career playing at county fairs and going on tour with Sherwin and Pam. We opened a new category for her due to her youth by introducing the Rising Star Award and hoping to encourage other youngsters to begin their music career at an early age. This young lady had achieved a lot in her young life all while maintaining an excellent academic score.\u201d\n\n\u201cDelaney is a role model for other youngsters who are trying to break into the music business,\u201d Iverson said. \u201cIt is a difficult task for adults to make it to stardom, but this young lady has a wonderful start. I am excited for her and I hope to see her continue her music career on stage and will continue to follow her career.\u201d\n\nJohnston, who began her amateur country music career at the tender young age of 8, has performed everywhere from South Shore to Nashville, Tennessee, all across the Midwest, and even a couple of gigs in Europe over the summer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been singing with Sherwin and Pam Linton of Minneapolis (Minnesota) for eight years,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cI went to a show in Labolt, South Dakota, and Sherwin and Pam were playing. I went up and requested \u2018Jackson\u2019 by Johnny (Cash) and June (Carter Cash) and Sherwin says to this day, he just sensed something (in the girl), so he invited me up on stage to sing with him. Then they invited me to the South Dakota State Fair and from there, it\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nShe has performed with them hundreds of times.\n\nSherwin Linton is a 60-year-old folk, country, and rockabilly music performer known for telling \u201cThe Johnny Cash Story.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was a very brave little girl to walk up to the stage, requesting to hear her favorite Johnny Cash/June Carter song \u2018Jackson,\u2019\u201d said Holly Johnston, Delaney\u2019s Johnston\u2019s mother. \u201cI was not at that show because I was on the road with Jason (Delaney\u2019s father) at the time. He was a trucker. My mom called me after the show and said \u2018You\u2019re not going to believe what your little girl just did.\u2019 I admit I was very surprised. I always knew that she was musical from a very young age, and Johnny Cash was definitely her music of choice.\u201d\n\nDelaney Johnston confirmed that rumor.\n\nHer favorite artist?\n\n\u201cJohnny Cash,\u201d Delaney Johnston said. \u201cIt\u2019s just his music.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer preschool teacher used to tell me how she was always singing Johnny Cash songs in class,\u201d Holly Johnston said.\n\nAnd to be clear, Delaney Johnston is a fan of a certain genre of country music.\n\n\u201cI like classic country,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cThe musicality is so much more original. I have grown up listening to it. It\u2019s always been a love of mine.\u201d\n\nSherwin Linton and the Cotton Kings are purveyors of authentic country music, which suits Johnston\u2019s style just fine.\n\n\u201cShe has loved country music since she was very little,\u201d Holly Johnston said. \u201cShe used to stay with my mom a lot and she loved classic country. Delaney developed that same love of classic country.\u201d\n\nWhile Delaney does perform with Sherwin Linton, she also performs as a solo act, often strumming her guitar while crooning those good old classic country tunes.\n\nLinton, also a South Dakota Country Music Hall of Fame member, helped Johnston cut two CDs of classic country tunes, \u201cI\u2019m Little But I\u2019m Loud,\u201d made when she was 10 years old, and \u201cYou\u2019re Looking At Country,\u201d two years later.\n\nThe first album won an award for \u201cYoung Country Artist CD of the Year 2015\u201d from the Rural Roots Music Commission.\n\nWhile Delaney Johnston sings alto, she is blessed with a four-octave range.\n\n\u201cSo I can sing just about anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m possibly going down to Nashville for a month this summer, possibly performing at the Nashville Night Life Theater every night.\u201d\n\nDelaney Johnston has previously performed at the Nashville Night Life Theater two times - once in fifth-grade, and once a couple of weeks ago.\n\n\u201cI performed with Tommy Cash, Johnny Cash\u2019s brother,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my music career, that\u2019s my favorite thing I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nSo, does Delaney Johnston get nervous prior to performing and up on stage?\n\n\u201cThe only time I get nervous is when I\u2019m singing something new,\u201d she said. \u201cThese old songs are just wired in my head. They just stay with me.\u201d\n\nHer mother agreed.\n\n\u201cFrom the very beginning of singing on stage she felt comfortable. She never got nervous, she was just having fun,\u201d Holly Johnston said.\n\nDelaney Johnston said the most rewarding part of performing is definitely the reaction from the audience.\n\n\u201cSeeing how supportive some people can be,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s funny to watch people out in the crowds sometimes and the smiles it puts on their faces. It\u2019s just great.\u201d\n\nWhile Delaney Johnston, currently a junior at Lead-Deadwood High School, would like to become a music teacher upon graduating, she\u2019s keeping the door to a full-blown singing career open, as well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to continue performing on a smaller level,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be some big famous person, but I\u2019m always going to have a love for music, so I need to keep it in my life.\u201d\n\nHolly and Jason Johnston are staunch supporters of their daughter, her dedication, and true talent.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even express how proud we are of her for her accomplishments in music and performing at only age 16,\u201d Holly Johnston said. \u201cTo be the youngest inductee to the South Dakota Country Music Hall of Fame is amazing. That she has kept a level head and stayed humble through it all makes us even more proud.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Black Hills Pioneer, http://www.bhpioneer.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sixteen-year-old Delaney Johnston, of Lead, said she felt an \"overwhelming sense of joy\" sweep over her when she stepped on stage last month to become the youngest-ever inductee into the South Dakota Country Music Hall of Fame.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jaci Conrad"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
