We wouldn\u2019t mind that one making a return, too!\n\n\n\nORIGINAL POST: Sept. 2, 2019\n\nKrispy Kreme has officially become a masters at the fine art of stuffing a glazed donut. The first ones were stuffed with original and chocolate fillings, which were then followed by birthday cake batter-stuffed donuts and two types of Reese\u2019s-stuffed donuts. Now the shop is making its pumpkin spice donut even better this year.\n\nNot only is Krispy Kreme bringing back its Pumpkin Spice Original Glazed Doughnut, but it\u2019s also introducing a brand-new seasonal donut. For the first time, the brand is stuffing that pumpkin spice donut with a \u201ccheesecake Kreme\u201d to create the Pumpkin Spice Original Filled Doughnut. So you\u2019ll get that same glazed pumpkin spice donut you love, but with the added cheesecake filling to take it up a notch.\n\nBoth pumpkin spice donuts will only be available from Sept. 2 to 8. While that\u2019s a short amount of time, Krispy Kreme is making it better by giving us the chance to get a donut for free. Dubbed the \u201cPumpkin Spice Purchase Protection\u201d plan, you can bring in any pumpkin spice product on the market and trade it at Krispy Kreme for the Pumpkin Spice Original Glazed Doughnut or Pumpkin Spice Original Filled Doughnut. This includes anything from pumpkin spice foods to cough drops to dog treats to room spray. So find something you\u2019re ready to part with and trade it in from now until Sept. 8.\n\nPhoto credit: Krispy Kreme More\n\nDon\u2019t get too upset that these donuts are only around for a short time, because Krispy Kreme is keeping its Classic Pumpkin Spice Cake Doughnut and Pumpkin Spice Latte around from now until Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cBad pumpkin spice products shouldn\u2019t happen to good people,\u201d Dave Skena, chief marketing officer for Krispy Kreme Doughnut Corporation, said in a press release. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been impacted by the proliferation of pumpkin spice products that don\u2019t make sense, come to Krispy Kreme and we\u2019ll make it all better with a free pumpkin spice doughnut.\u201d\n\nRead More:\n\nThese Seasonal Twinkies Are Stuffed With Pumpkin Spice Filling\n\nStart Your Day With Frosted Flakes\u2019 Limited-Edition Pumpkin Spice Cereal\n\nUh, You Have to See This Pumpkin Spice Latte That Is Also a Hard Seltzer\n\nFollow BestProducts.com on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest!\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "We weren't ready to say goodbye.", "authors": ["Caitlyn Fitzpatrick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.PhHumzpk.wxzd4Ehz9x9A--~B/aD01MDA7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/best_products_872/3fb34a7a71c6c1ecdb3609f34bf72c11", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
