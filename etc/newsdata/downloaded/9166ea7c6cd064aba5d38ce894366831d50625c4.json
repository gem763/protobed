A valve accidentally leaked some of the vehicle\u2019s propellant, starting a chain reaction that caused the spacecraft to burst apart. Now that the cause has been identified, SpaceX says it is replacing these parts in all future versions of the vehicle to make sure this explosive leak doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\nThe spacecraft that SpaceX lost was a test version of the company\u2019s Crew Dragon, a capsule that\u2019s being built for NASA to take astronauts to and from the International Space Station. This particular capsule was the very first Crew Dragon that SpaceX had ever launched into space. In March, the vehicle \u2014 without a crew \u2014 successfully docked with the ISS and then returned back to Earth during a flawless test mission. But during routine tests on the vehicle on April 20th, the capsule violently broke apart and spewed orange gas into the sky.\n\nSpaceX immediately formed an investigation team after the accident to figure out what caused the explosion, and the company has been working with NASA ever since. But up until six weeks ago, SpaceX still hadn\u2019t narrowed down the exact cause. With the discovery of the leak, the company now says the investigation is about 80 percent complete. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell... how much time we need to close this out,\u201d Hans Koenigsman, vice president of build and flight reliability at SpaceX, said during a press conference. \u201cBut you want to make sure that the capsule \u2014 everything \u2014 you want to make sure that we find all the right corrective actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that the components should not have done.\u201d\n\nThe company believes that the problem originated with the Crew Dragon\u2019s emergency abort system, which consists of a series of small thrusters embedded within the capsule. If all goes well during a mission, these tiny thrusters are never really meant to be used. But if there is some kind of failure during a future launch, the thrusters can ignite and carry the Crew Dragon safely away from a disintegrating rocket.\n\nSpaceX says that a leaky valve caused the propellant needed for these thrusters to cross into another system \u2014 one of really high pressure. When this contamination occurred, the high forces slammed the liquid around, causing valuable components to fail and leading to the ultimate loss of the capsule.\n\nKoenigsman said that this contamination definitely was not anticipated, though the kind of valve that leaked has been known to have some internal leakage problem. Ultimately, he acknowledged that, to some extent, this was a design issue. \u201cIt\u2019s something that the components should not have done,\u201d Koenigsman said. \u201cBut at the same time, we learned a very valuable lesson on something going forward, one that makes the Crew Dragon a safer vehicle.\u201d\n\n\u201cit was a huge gift for us.\u201d\n\nSpaceX will replace all of these types of valves with another component known as a burst disk, which is supposed to be much more reliable, according to Koenigsman. SpaceX claims it has many Crew Dragons in various stages of production at the company\u2019s headquarters in California. However, it\u2019s unclear when the Crew Dragon will fly again. Before the explosion, SpaceX had been planning to fly its first astronauts on the vehicle by the end of the summer. Now it\u2019s looking increasingly likely that SpaceX won\u2019t fly people until the beginning of next year \u2014 though Koenigsman isn\u2019t ruling out a 2019 flight. \u201cMy emphasis is really on making sure this is safe,\u201d he said. \u201cSo end of the year, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible, but it\u2019s getting increasingly difficult.\u201d\n\nHowever, a NASA representative said she is appreciative for the failure, especially since it occurred on the ground instead of during a flight. \u201cWe had the ability to find an issue with the hardware and be able to find the hardware and be able to assess the hardware,\u201d Kathy Lueders, the program manager for NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, said during the press conference. \u201cSo it was a huge gift for us.\u201d", "description": "SpaceX says it has figured out what caused one of its spacecraft to explode during a ground test in April.
