Alcaraz later found himself working for Pixar as a cultural consultant on \u201cCoco,\u201d helping the filmmakers avoid similar missteps. And the movie, which featured an almost entirely Latino cast, earned praise for its portrayal of Mexican culture and went on to score Academy Awards in 2018 for best animated feature and best original song.\n\nToday, the Southern California native serves as a cultural consultant and freelance writer for the Nickelodeon VIAB, +0.33% animated series \u201cThe Casagrandes,\u201d a spinoff of \u201cThe Loud House\u201d about a multigenerational Mexican-American family set to premiere Monday. The show follows the exploits of 11-year-old Ronnie Anne Santiago (Izabella Alvarez) after she moves to a city with her mother (Sumalee Montano) and brother (Carlos PenaVega), featuring voices from actors like Melissa Joan Hart and Ken Jeong.\n\nIt\u2019s a weird job, Alcaraz said, but he added, \u201cIt\u2019s great.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish the job didn\u2019t have to exist, because I wish everybody was culturally competent and we had mass diversity all over and equal representation \u2014 but we don\u2019t,\u201d Alcaraz, 55, told MarketWatch during last month\u2019s L\u2019Attitude conference in San Diego. (MarketWatch parent Dow Jones served as a media partner to the conference.)\n\nAlcaraz, who grew up in San Diego as the son of two Mexican immigrants, says he wants \u201cCasagrandes\u201d viewers from multigenerational Latino families to see stories that reflect their lives \u2014 reacting along the lines of \u201cThat\u2019s just like my abuela!\u201d rather than \u201cI\u2019ve never heard a Latino say that before,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI want them to not be pulled out of the moment \u2014 when I watch something and it\u2019s got a bad, fake, obviously-Hollywood take on something Latino, it just takes me out and I don\u2019t enjoy the experience anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cSome productions use Google GOOG, +0.53% GOOGL, +0.59% to figure out Latino stuff and put Spanish in things, and it always fails. It\u2019s always awful.\u201d\n\nAlcaraz\u2019s \u201cCasagrandes\u201d gig includes reviewing scripts, making suggestions about language, and monitoring Spanish pronunciations in recordings, he said \u2014 for example, coaching lead actress Alvarez on how to correctly pronounce abuela and abuelo, grandmother and grandfather in Spanish. The Nickelodeon series also contains scenes featuring la chancla, a sandal turned \u201cfearsome weapon of discipline\u201d wielded by Abuela Rosa (Sonia Manzano).\n\n\u201cInitially in the writer\u2019s room we were shy about introducing it, thinking it might not be approved of by standards and practices, but the storyboard artists took the initiative and put a chancla in an episode,\u201d Alcaraz said. Its addition proved \u201chilarious, authentic and traumatizing\u201d for some show staff who came from Mexican and Latino upbringings, he said. (Memes have also captured this shared experience.)\n\nEarly on, Alcaraz also gave notes on the family structure and relationships unique to a family like the Casagrandeses, including the deference paid to elders. There was a moment where Ronnie Anne grabs her grandfather by the collar in a moment of anger, he said. \u201cI said, \u2018No, that would not happen in a regular big, Mexican family \u2014 that kid would be buried out back.\u2019\u201d Similarly, he said he reiterated to writers that Abuela was the head of the household.\n\nThe U.S. Hispanic population totals 58.9 million, translating to an estimated 18% of the population. Still, one 2014 study co-commissioned by Columbia University found that \u201cwith few exceptions, Latino participation in mainstream English-language media is stunningly low.\u201d \u201cEven further, when Latinos are visible, they tend to be portrayed through decades-old stereotypes as criminals, law enforcers, cheap labor, and hypersexualized beings,\u201d the report\u2019s authors added.\n\nWhen the topic of Ronnie Anne\u2019s father arose, Alcaraz said he \u201cinsisted that he be a professional.\u201d The character, who would eventually be voiced by the prolific Mexican actor Eugenio Derbez, was written as a physician who lives and works in Peru. \u201cThat\u2019s a win for me, in my book,\u201d Alcaraz said.\n\nOthers have also lent their expertise to help boost the authenticity of film and TV projects. For instance, Am\u00e9rico Mendoza-Mori, a professor of Quechua and Spanish at the University of Pennsylvania, consulted for Paramount Pictures on the script for the new live-action Dora the Explorer film, \u201cDora and the Lost City of Gold.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, Disney reportedly brought on cultural advisers for last year\u2019s live-action \u201cAladdin,\u201d presumably to avoid criticisms of the original 1992 film that centered on Islamophobia and crude portrayal of Arab culture. (In the end, the remake stilldidn\u2019t escape controversy.)\n\nThe hiring of cultural or diversity consultants on such projects has become a growing trend, said Rashad Robinson, president of the racial-justice organization Color of Change, which has provided pro-bono cultural consulting for shows including \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d \u201cBeing Mary Jane\u201d and \u201cSeven Seconds.\u201d \u201cMore and more, consumers of color and white consumers want to see full, accurate portrayals of the world that we live in,\u201d Robinson told MarketWatch.\n\nBut as valuable as cultural experts\u2019 insights are, Robinson said, it\u2019s important that consultants aren\u2019t simply employed to avoid enacting more structural changes to writers\u2019 rooms \u2014 like hiring people of color and giving them a platform to tell stories. Less than 14% of 3,817 writers on scripted shows in 2017 were people of color, according to a report commissioned by Color of Change.\n\n\u201cWe can come in and consult \u2014 but we also don\u2019t want to use our consulting to allow the networks [to] avoid having to actually deal with the diversity challenges,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen used properly, however, it can make all the difference to films and TV shows. For \u201cSeven Seconds,\u201d a Netflix NFLX, +4.84% crime drama about the death of a black teenager, Robinson\u2019s organization brought people who had been impacted by police violence into the writers\u2019 room, he said, and provided writers with videos of actual bail hearings.", "description": "\u2018Some productions use Google to figure out Latino stuff.\u2019", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT105_alcara_ZG_20191010184456.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
