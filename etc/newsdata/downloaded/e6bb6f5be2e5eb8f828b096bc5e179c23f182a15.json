[Photo/Xinhua]\n\nA draft regulation of East China's Zhejiang province to allow students to quit working on their homework after a certain time in the evening has sparked heated debate on the internet.\n\nThe regulation stipulates that primary school students can refuse to do the homework after 9 pm and junior high school students after 10 pm, provided that their parents agree.\n\nThe regulation, part of a guideline released by the Education Department of Zhejiang on Monday, is aimed at cutting the academic workload on students.\n\nThe initiative ignited furious debate among Chinese netizens, especially parents.\n\nWhile some applauded the measure, believing it would, to some extent, ease students' stress and ensure happier after-school time, many complained it will actually add more pressure on parents and children.\n\nThat's because examinations are still scheduled and students need good scores to get into a good college. This could prompt more parents, feeling anxious that their kids may lag behind their peers in school, to turn to after-school training institutions.\n\nOthers also pointed out that many students can't finish their homework not due to excessive assignments, but because they procrastinate or work at low efficiency. The regulation might offer them more excuses not to do the homework.\n\nMany also worried it is difficult to fully implement the proposed measure.\n\nApart from this, the guideline also requires teachers to establish no more than one teacher-parent chat group. Nor can they assign homework in the chat group or ask parents to check homework, according to the guideline.", "description": "East China's Zhejiang province's new initiative to allow primary and junior high school students to quit working on homework after a certain time each evening sparked heated debate on the internet.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/30/5db955eda310cf3e97a39553.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
