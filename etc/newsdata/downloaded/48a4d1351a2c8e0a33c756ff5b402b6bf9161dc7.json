But it sounds like your sister has become what therapists call a \u201chelp-rejecting complainer.\u201d For help-rejecting complainers, complaining is a way of being. They find comfort in going on ad nauseam about their plight, while giving excuse after excuse about why any suggested course of action won\u2019t make matters any better. They don\u2019t want help; they want your sympathy, and validation for their perception that they\u2019re being treated unfairly and that there\u2019s nothing they can do to improve their situation. And since they aren\u2019t interested in solutions or talking about something else, help-rejecting complainers tend to sap the energy of people who care about them.\n\nWhy do some people do this? Many people who relate in this way suffer from an underlying depression, and depression distorts their thinking and makes them feel helpless. People who are depressed also tend to feel lonely, unheard, or unseen, particularly in their pain. They want to connect with others, but if they are also help-rejecting complainers, that can create a vicious cycle. They push people away, then they don\u2019t feel heard, so they complain even more, which pushes people farther away. But for the complainer, this is actually a reward: She\u2019s just gotten something else to complain about.\n\nTo break this cycle, there are a few things you can do. First, pointing out that her negativity might be pushing people away won\u2019t help. Help-rejecting complainers don\u2019t see themselves as negative people; they see everything out there as negative, and they\u2019re simply reacting to it. (That\u2019s why if you suggest therapy, which can be very effective for help-rejecting complainers, she\u2019ll reject that suggestion, too.) What your sister wants most is to feel heard, so when she complains about her children or friends or boss, the best thing you can do is validate what she\u2019s saying, but in a particular way. Instead of just saying, \u201cOh, that\u2019s too bad that your children don\u2019t call enough,\u201d your job is to over-validate her position.\n\nFor instance, you can say: \u201cYour children are so ungrateful. I can\u2019t even imagine what it\u2019s like to have such utterly selfish children.\u201d Or: \u201cYour friends are horrible for not wanting to see you more often. And they sound like absolute narcissists, talking about themselves instead of asking after you. I\u2019m so sorry you have such inconsiderate friends.\u201d Or: \u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable that your friends won\u2019t set you up on dates. They have absolutely no regard for how lonely you are. If the situation were reversed, I know you\u2019d be setting them up on dozens of dates with eligible men you know.\u201d Or: \u201cYour boss should be fired. I can\u2019t believe that HR doesn\u2019t have a file of complaints. It\u2019s terrible that there\u2019s absolutely nothing you can do to make things better at work. I feel so bad for you that you have to spend the rest of your life in a miserable job.\u201d", "description": "I want to have a good relationship with her, but I feel overwhelmed by her negativity.", "authors": ["Lori Gottlieb"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/unhappy_sister_final_high_res/facebook.jpg?1567404260"}
