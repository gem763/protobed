Robert E. Lee still stands in Charlottesville. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\nTwo years ago, when white supremacists descended on Charlottesville, organizers of the Unite the Right rally said they were defending a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, which the city planned to remove from a public park.\n\nThe deadly street violence and outpouring of racist and anti-Semitic venom on Aug. 11 and 12, 2017, continue to haunt the national psyche.\n\nBut what about the sculpture that prompted the angry gathering, a huge bronze rendering of Lee astride his beloved steed?\n\nWell, it\u2019s still standing, as is a towering bronze equestrian statue of rebel Gen. Thomas J. \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson, which the city also wants to remove. And the two Old Dixie icons won\u2019t be going anywhere in the foreseeable future amid a seemingly endless legal fight over their historical meaning.\n\n\n\nWhite nationalists and neo-Nazis clash with counterprotesters as they enter Emancipation Park during the Unite the Right rally on Aug. 12, 2017, in Charlottesville.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nWhile supporters contend that the statues, installed in the 1920s, are simply memorials to the Confederacy\u2019s war veterans, the city argues that the monuments \u201cwere intended to, and did, send messages of intimidation, exclusion and hostility to African Americans.\u201d The question of whether the statues \u201cwere part of a regime of city-sanctioned segregation\u201d appears headed for Virginia\u2019s Supreme Court.\n\nNo matter how the statues are interpreted, though, Charlottesville\u2019s history of Jim Crow apartheid is undeniable. When the Jackson and Lee sculptures were dedicated, in 1921 and 1924, respectively, this college community, like the rest of the South and much of the country, was steeped in institutionalized racism.\n\n[The Confederacy was built on slavery. How can so many Southern whites still believe otherwise?]\n\nFor instance:\n\nEight months before the Jackson monument was unveiled, local citizens of privileged color were aghast at a subversive wish list published Feb. 12, 1921, in the black-owned Charlottesville Messenger, and reprinted, for shock value, on the front page of the city\u2019s white-run paper, the Daily Progress.\n\nTitled \u201cThe New Negro,\u201d the article called for \u201cTeachers\u2019 salaries based on service not on color;\u201d a four-year high school for black students; \u201cBetter street facilities in Negro districts\u201d; a voice for blacks in municipal government; and the abolition of \u201c \u2018Jim Crow\u2019 street cars.\u201d The Daily Progress, appalled by the manifesto, echoed its flabbergasted readers in an editorial warning that \u201cthe negroes\u201d should remember their place:\n\n\u201cThe circulation of such absurd tirades and impossible proposals \u2026 only serve to make the problem of the law-abiding and respected element among the colored people that much harder, [and] if trouble ensues, its greatest weight will ultimately fall on them.\u201d\n\nAfter a month of threats and denunciations, the Messenger\u2019s editor, John G. Shelton, mollified whites with an editorial of his own, disavowing, point by point, the radical ideas advocated by the author of \u201cThe New Negro,\u201d a Charlottesville native who was head of the St. Louis Urban League.\n\n\u201cHaving thus clearly stated our position,\u201d Shelton concluded apologetically, \u201cwe will consider the incident closed and bid farewell to the so called New Negro, and jog along in our accustomed way, well content with the old ones with whom we have thus far journeyed in peace, happiness and a slight measure of success.\u201d\n\nSuch was Charlottesville.\n\n'Knights of the Ku Klux Klan\u2019\n\nThe statues, in the city\u2019s Court Square area, were donated by Paul Goodloe McIntire, a philanthropist whose slave-owning father had been financially humbled by the Civil War. McIntire, who was not quite 5 years old when the South surrendered in 1865, amassed a fortune in Chicago and New York before retiring in his hometown and becoming a civic benefactor.\n\n\n\nPaul Goodloe McIntire commissioned the statues of Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson and Robert E. Lee that were unveiled in 1921 and 1924, respectively. (Holsinger Studio Collection, Special Collections Department, University of Virginia Library/Holsinger Studio Collection, Special Collections Department, University of Virginia Library)\n\n\u201cThe princely giver of princely gifts,\u201d as he was called, commissioned the monuments in the late 1910s, hiring New York sculptors Henry Shrady (for Lee) and Charles Keck (for Jackson). Both statues were expected to be finished by about 1921. At the time, though, Shrady was immersed in his most ambitious creation, the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial near the U.S. Capitol, and he fell behind on the Lee project.\n\nAfter Shrady died in 1922, another sculptor took over the job. That was why Keck\u2019s rendering of Jackson \u2014 a lesser demigod than Lee \u2014 went up three years before the statue of the South\u2019s top military commander, regarded by Confederate apologists as unrivaled in fortitude and chivalry.\n\n[The truth about Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee: He wasn\u2019t very good at his job]\n\nOn Oct. 19, 1921, the day of the first unveiling, Edwin A. Alderman, president of the University of Virginia, addressed a crowd of thousands in front of a 10-foot sculpture atop a 13-foot pedestal. \u201cTo the city of Charlottesville, and, in a high spiritual sense, to the valiant souls now living who fought beneath the Stars and Bars,\u201d Alderman said, he was presenting the Jackson statue \u201cin the belief that it will stand here forever.\u201d\n\nBy then, the Confederacy\u2019s defense of human bondage had been supplanted in popular thought by a gauzy fiction, the myth of the Lost Cause. This version of history held that the insurrection had been a second American Revolution, a righteous uprising against federal economic tyranny, and that the men who waged the rebellion should be revered for their patriotism and sacrifice.\n\n\u201cTo call it treason is to add viciousness to stupidity,\u201d Alderman told the gathering in Jackson Park, awash in moonlight-and-magnolias nostalgia.\n\nThe ex-rebel soldiers attending the ceremony belonged to a dying generation that had witnessed 12 years of black suffrage and biracial governance in the South during postwar Reconstruction. After the demise of federally enforced political equality, the culture and legal bulwark of Jim Crow were established, excluding blacks from civic life and denying basic entitlements such as those sought by \u201cThe New Negro.\u201d\n\n\n\nThousands gathered for the unveiling of the monument to Gen. Thomas J. \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson on Oct. 19, 1921. (Holsinger Studio Collection/University of Virginia Library)\n\nA majority of the Confederate monuments in the United States today were installed between 1900 and 1930. Whether the statues were erected only to honor vanishing heroes, or also symbolized the restoration of white power, made no practical difference to Charlottesville\u2019s African Americans living under Jim Crow. Most of them bore daily oppression and ridicule silently while fearing for their safety.\n\n\u201cKU KLUX KLAN ORGANIZED HERE,\u201d a headline said, the summer before the Jackson dedication.\n\n[The Ku Klux Klan was dead. The first Hollywood blockbuster revived it.]\n\nLynchings and other forms of racial terrorism were rampant in the South in the early 20th century. In 1915, filmmaker D.W. Griffith\u2019s lurid box-office smash, \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d glorified the murderous, long-dormant Klan of the Reconstruction era and helped fuel a vast resurgence of the Invisible Empire. New chapters, or klaverns, were popping up all over the country, including in Charlottesville.\n\nA notice began appearing on public bulletin boards around the city in June 1921, reflecting the nation\u2019s anti-immigration fervor as well as ancient animus toward blacks: \u201cDo you believe in the tenets of the Christian Religion, Free Schools, Free Speech, Free Press, Law Enforcement, Liberty and White Supremacy? Can you take a MAN\u2019S OATH? Drop a line to M.N.T., General Delivery, Charlottesville.\u201d\n\nSigned, \u201cKnights of the Ku Klux Klan.\u201d\n\nThe local klavern was designated Klan No. 9, and the Daily Progress gave its meetings and cross-burnings favorable coverage.\n\n\u201cNo man can subscribe to tenets like the following and fail to become a better and bigger and more patriotic citizen,\u201d one article declared, citing Klan No. 9\u2019s central principle: \u201cRigid preservation of white supremacy. The destinies of America shall remain with the white race; they shall never be entrusted to the black, the brown, the yellow, or to the unclean hands of hybrids and mongrels.\u201d\n\nThe story added, \u201cThe Charlottesville Klan is not the largest in Virginia, but it numbers among its members many of our able and influential citizens, and it is here to stay.\u201d\n\n\u2018Lee statue on the way\u2019\n\nCharlottesville, population 48,000, is four times as big now than when the statues were erected. Today\u2019s electorate, largely white, votes decidedly blue, and two of the City Council\u2019s five members, including Mayor Nikuyah Walker (I), are African American.\n\nA lawsuit aimed at saving the sculptures was filed in March 2017 \u2014 five months before the violent white-supremacist rally \u2014 and the litigation in Charlottesville Circuit Court has gone in favor of the 13 plaintiffs, all Confederate heritage enthusiasts. In rulings this year, Judge Richard E. Moore decided that the hulking effigies are war memorials protected by a 1904 Virginia preservation law.\n\n\n\nThe statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E.

Meanwhile, the Lee monument, 26 feet high including its pedestal, stands where it always has, in a small park donated by \u201cthe princely giver,\u201d which folks in the 1920s knew was for whites only.\n\nIn 1924, three months before the statue was unveiled, Virginia passed its Racial Integrity Act, barring interracial marriage. The law (struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1967 Loving v. Virginia case) was cheered in Charlottesville by U-Va.\u2019 s Anglo-Saxon Club. The group hosted public lectures on the perils of miscegenation, including one by a university biology professor and eugenicist named Ivey F. Lewis.\n\n[Death of \u2018a devil\u2019: The white supremacist got hit by a car. His victims celebrated.]\n\n\u201cThe mixing of the whites with the blacks was the cause of the fall of the civilizations of Rome, Greece, Egypt and India,\u201d a local reporter wrote, summarizing Lewis\u2019s speech under the headline \u201cVirginia Again Leading the Nation.\u201d The article said: \u201cWith the mixing came a laxness of morals and a crumbling of culture. America faces the same danger.\u201d\n\nThen, two weeks later, on April 17, exciting news:\n\n\u201cLEE STATUE ON THE WAY\u201d\n\nThe dedication was set for May 21, coinciding with the 1924 reunion of the Grand Camp of Confederate Veterans of Virginia, a week-long festival of Old Dixie pride that was coming to Charlottesville. The city, preparing to welcome the gathering of aged rebs, festooned itself in the Stars and Bars.\n\nThe anonymous \u201cable and influential citizens\u201d of Klan No. 9 \u2014 not to be confused with Klan No. 5, the U-Va. campus klavern \u2014 celebrated by burning a giant cross on the evening of May 16 and the next night marched through Charlottesville in their hoods, accompanied by a brass band. \u201cThousands lined the sidewalks,\u201d the press said, \u201cin eagerness to see the parade.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with local historians in 2005, an African American woman recalled the march. She was a youngster in 1924, visiting one of her grandfathers, who had been born into slavery.\n\n\u201cHe told all of us grandchildren to quickly get into the house and stay there,\u201d she remembered. \u201cHe went out to the front gate of the house and watched a parade of Ku Klux Klan men, completely covered in white sheets, as they marched down West Main Street. Afterwards he came in and said, \u2018I recognized every single one of them!\u2019 He was their barber and knew them all by their shoes!\u201d\n\nOn the afternoon of the unveiling, the Rev. Henry W. Battle, known for his stirring orations, rose before the multitudes in Lee Park and extolled the gray-bearded veterans on hand. Hundreds of them had mustered in the city from all over Virginia, their ranks thinned by time, \u201ccherishing deathless devotion to a cause as precious to them in old age as it was when, in their glorious youth, they trod with the proud bearing of kings.\u201d\n\nThe pastor said nothing about human chattel. He said nothing about the forsaken ideals of Reconstruction or the rise of Jim Crow. There was no mention of the aspirations of \u201cThe New Negro\u201d in Battle\u2019s grandiloquent gusts.\n\nThen he directed his remarks to the younger people in the crowd, \u201cthe sons and daughters of the Confederacy,\u201d whose \u201cnoblest heritage\u201d had descended \u201cfrom such men as are these venerable fathers.\u201d To the newer generations, he issued a sacred charge that would carry down the century, echoing now in a lawsuit by true believers in the Lost Cause.\n\n\u201cTheir supreme duty,\u201d Battle declared, will be \u201cto keep the record of Confederate heroism free from the stain of calumny.\u201d\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\nThe day white Virginia stopped admiring Gen.
