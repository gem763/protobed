They use the data to track inventory changes, monitor the health of equipment in the field, and handle other functions aimed at fine-tuning the production process. Algorithms applied to large amounts of historical and real-time sensor data can increase the accuracy of predictions or analyses.\n\nGartner this week forecast that the total number of IoT-connected devices in use world-wide\u2014including sensors, machines and vehicles\u2014will reach 4.8 billion by the end of the year, up 22% from 2018. By 2020, it will hit 5.8 billion, Gartner said.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. last year announced that it would invest $5 billion in Internet of Things technology over the next four years.\n\nGartner estimates that manufacturers are among the top five adopters of IoT, a group that includes utilities, security firms, government services and automotive companies. The research firm\u2019s forecast takes into account a near-term slowdown in the manufacturing sector sparked by trade issues, Mr. Middleton said.\n\nThe U.S. manufacturing sector shrank last month for the first time in three years, according to a report Tuesday by the Institute for Supply Management. It said trade was the most significant issue for the U.S. purchasing and supply executives surveyed. The figures follow recent reports of contracting factory activity in the U.K., Germany, Japan and South Korea, fueling fears of a broad manufacturing slowdown.\n\nThe U.S. imposed tariffs of 15% on Chinese goods including clothing, tools and electronics on Sunday, the same day that retaliatory Chinese measures took effect, targeting imports of U.S. soybeans, crude oil and pharmaceuticals. The U.S. has delayed a further round of tariffs of 15% on $156 billion of Chinese-made smartphones, laptops, toys, videogames and other products until Dec. 15.\n\n\u201cGlobal trade issues are absolutely impacting how manufacturers are thinking about digital in general and IoT in particular,\u201d said Peter Guarraia, a partner at Bain & Co. who leads the firm\u2019s global supply chain practice.\n\nHe said U.S. manufacturers are considering investing in IoT and other digital tools in domestic facilities to increase their ability to bring production back home or source it from another low-cost location to remain competitive.\n\nCharles Meyers, chief executive of Equinix Inc., a U.S.-based global data-center operator, said he sees companies in sectors affected the most by import tariffs\u2014such as retailers and manufacturers\u2014pushing ahead with digital technology deployments, including IoT.\n\n\u201cIf you look at companies, they\u2019re prioritizing their digital transformation efforts and they\u2019ll find a way to resource those efforts independent of the macro climate,\u201d Mr. Meyers said.\n\nWrite to Angus Loten at angus.loten@wsj.com", "description": "Chief information officers are keeping a close eye on the mounting trade dispute between the U.S. and China as they consider spending on the Internet of Things, connected digital tools designed to eke out greater efficiencies.", "authors": ["Angus Loten", "Angus.Loten Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104057/social", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
