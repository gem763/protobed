Some members brought their cell phones into the secure room, known as a \"SCIF,\" in violation of security protocols.\n\nThe members delayed the deposition of Laura Cooper, a Defense Department official who deals with Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, for more than five hours before it eventually got underway Wednesday afternoon, leading many Democrats to decry the move as a political \"stunt\" to obstruct the probe.\n\nPresident Trump, meanwhile, pushed GOP buttons by comparing the inquiry to a \"lynching\", sparking widespread criticism for his casual comparison to a term often associated with the mob killings of African Americans in the Jim Crow era. Several Republican leaders including Mitch McConnell parted ways with the president's questionable comparison. Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, however, doubled down and said it was an \"accurate\" description. Graham has since introduced Senate legislation formally condemning the entire probe.\n\nTrump hails win with \"permanent ceasefire\" in Syria\n\nWhile political fallout over the president's Syria policy is still raw, President Trump announced Wednesday that the U.S. would lift sanctions on Turkey because there will be a \"permanent\" ceasefire in the conflict between Turkey and the Kurds in northern Syria.\n\nThe Kurds largely withdrew from the region under the terms of an earlier 120-hour ceasefire negotiated by the U.S.\n\nThe announcement came after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin brokered a new six-day ceasefire, which allows Russia to step into the power vacuum created after Mr. Trump announced the withdrawal of 1,000 U.S. troops from northern Syria.\n\nIn his announcement, Mr. Trump said Turkey called to inform him early Wednesday morning that there would be a \"permanent\" ceasefire between Turkey and the Syrian Kurds.\n\n\"Face the Nation\" Guest Lineup:\n\nSen.
