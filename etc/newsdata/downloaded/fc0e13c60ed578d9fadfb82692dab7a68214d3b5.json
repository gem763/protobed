REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nNext to a photomontage of Draghi with fangs and dressed as a vampire, Bild\u2019s headline read: \u201cCount Draghila is sucking our accounts dry.\u201d\n\nHoping to kick-start economic activity nearly a decade after the euro zone\u2019s debt crisis, the ECB on Thursday cut interest rates deeper into negative territory and promised bond purchases with no end-date to push borrowing costs even lower.\n\nThe bigger-than-expected stimulus immediately fuelled concerns among frugal Germans, who have complained for years that the ECB\u2019s low interest rates are denying them a decent rate of return on their savings.\n\n\u201cThe horror for German savers goes on and on,\u201d Bild wrote.\n\nThe newspaper has taken aim at Draghi before.\n\nDuring the euro zone crisis, Bild gifted the Italian a spiked Prussian helmet from 1871 to show its confidence that he would adhere to German-style discipline. Draghi put the helmet on a shelf in his office.\n\nVoicing Germans\u2019 angst, Helmut Schleweis, president of Germany\u2019s powerful savings banks association, said the ECB\u2019s latest policy package \u201cdoes more harm than good\u201d.\n\nGerman Finance Minister Olaf Scholz sought to calm savers worried ahead of Thursday\u2019s ECB meeting.\n\n\u201cMost contracts that customers have with their banks do not currently allow such penalty rates, so the problem is not acute,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cBanks\u2019 boards are wise enough to grasp what they would trigger with such penalty rates.\n\nBut Joachim Wuermeling, a board member of Germany\u2019s central bank, the Bundesbank, struck a different tone: \u201cBanks could soon pass on lower interest rates to even more customers,\u201d Wuermeling told Focus magazine.\n\nNobody should be surprised if banks demanded higher fees and were mulling negative interest rates, Wuermeling said. \u201cIt may be necessary from a business and banking supervisory point of view,\u201d he added.\n\nGermans have long looked to the Bundesbank as a pillar of stability and guarantor of a stable currency.\n\nFormed in 1957, the German central bank was a model for central bank independence in the years that followed, but its president is now just one voice on the ECB\u2019s Governing Council.\n\nNew Austrian National Bank Governor Robert Holzmann, who also sits on the ECB\u2019s policymaking Council, said the ECB\u2019s policy met \u201cpushback\u201d at a meeting this week.\n\nAsked whether the new measures were a mistake, Holzmann, who has a seat on the ECB Governing Board, told Bloomberg TV: \u201cI\u2019m sure this idea crossed the mind of some people and it definitely crossed my mind.\u201d", "description": "Mass-selling German newspaper Bild on Friday accused European Central Bank President Mario Draghi of \"sucking dry\" the bank accounts of Germany's savers, a day after the ECB cut interest rates deeper into negative territory.", "authors": ["Paul Carrel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429357890&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0J3", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
