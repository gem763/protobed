Photo: Stephanie Berger.\n\nSatoshi Miyagi\u2019s grand, mesmerizing Antigone is not a tragedy. It seems like it might have been more of one when the director first tackled the 2,500-year-old play back in 2004. But by the time Miyagi brought a new version, reenvisioned with the Shizuoka Performing Arts Center, to the Avignon Festival in 2017, the ancient Greek drama had become a Buddhist ritual, an expansive tribute to the spirits of the dead, visually and musically gorgeous and released from any Western notions of the dramatic power of emotional angst.\n\nThat\u2019s the Antigone that\u2019s currently taking place in an 18,000-gallon pool of water at the Park Avenue Armory. \u201cThe idea that there is water between the land of the living and the land of the dead is an image shared by both Japan and Ancient Greece,\u201d writes Miyagi in a program note. \u201cWe have this idea of a border separating two things being defined by water \u2026 [And] the polytheistic way of thinking in pre-Christian Greece is actually something very familiar to us in Japan. So we don\u2019t feel that doing Antigone is importing something from Western culture, but something that we can touch quite directly.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no way I can speak from anything but gut instinct when it comes to exactly how the more than two-millennia-old plays of Sophocles might actually have felt to an audience first experiencing them in the theater, but Miyagi\u2019s staging of Antigone \u2014 though it\u2019s Japanese in every way \u2014 strikes me as embodying something fundamental at the heart of these ancient Mediterranean texts. Perhaps they\u2019re not, as so many post-Stanislavski Western stagings have tried to convince us, treacherous psychological peaks to be scaled with an excess of howling, breast-beating, and garment-rending. Perhaps they\u2019re not really psychological \u2014 at least in our Strasberg-and-Brando sense of the word \u2014 at all. They were always rituals: massive and sacred communal rites performed by actors in masks, physically stylized, distant, and, in the original sense, awesome \u2014 the very concept of catharsis essentially a religious one, a kind of shared public cleansing. Miyagi\u2019s Antigone is not a story about the living; it\u2019s a rite for the dead and an acknowledgement of the thinness of the veil that separates the two. As such, without ever seeking to stir up the earthly passions of its audience, it is deeply, existentially moving.\n\nNot that it\u2019s wholly, heart-poundingly compelling in every moment: Miyagi has crafted his play around a limited number of big gestures \u2014 the enormous wading pool with its jutting, rock-garden-like islands; the ethereal white robes and skeletal white bodysuits on all his actors (the ghostly garments are by Kayo Takahashi); the bunraku-inspired separation of characters into a speaking actor and a silent, moving actor \u2014 and in between these macro choices there aren\u2019t always a plethora of micro choices. You\u2019ve got to settle into the show\u2019s rhythm, let your heartbeat slow down and your Aristotelian expectations soften. It can be difficult, as an American theatergoer, to let go of plot and character as the central engines for a story. But, at least to my limited understanding, Buddhism is partly about learning to release your grasp on the things of the world. And when you open your hands and allow yourself to float in Miyagi\u2019s production, the experience is hypnotic.\n\nIn a way, Miyagi\u2019s company forces the audience out of a conventional Western relationship with plot right away: As we enter the theater and take our places, we watch the actors slowing moving through the huge, dark pool, their translucent white robes dragging in the water. They carry candles inside of singing bowls that they play softly. The cavernous space is all shadow and hush, with just the flicker of tiny lights, the lap of water and the shimmering buzz of those simple instruments. Then the trance is broken by a procession of actors who march around the pool\u2019s periphery, beating time on various pieces of percussion. \u201cGood evening, ladies and gentlemen!\u201d one of them shouts in English, a huge smile on her face. (\u201cEnglish,\u201d she\u2019ll inform us in a few moments, \u201cis a very difficult language, so we will need your support\u201d \u2014 at least for the extent of the prologue; the show itself is in Japanese with English subtitles.) In a bouncy, near-cartoonish vein, she and her fellow actors play out an abbreviated summary of Antigone for us \u2014 \u201cIn case you\u2019ve forgotten the story!\u201d she beams. The tonal 180 from the murky, meditative preshow is so jarring that it made me giggle \u2014 but then I decided I dug it. Here were the traveling players, doing an almost comedic preshow summary of their verse tragedy in Hamlet. There\u2019s something unembarrassed and essential about the theatricality of Miyagi\u2019s preshow: It refuses to take itself too seriously. It\u2019s town-square stuff, not fancy opera-house stuff, and it\u2019s exciting to see a director trust in an audience\u2019s ability to shift quickly between styles \u2014 to follow his actors from burlesque to bunraku, surrendering to the quicksilver spirit of play.\n\nAfter the prologue, once we\u2019ve launched into the story about the young woman who buries her brother in defiance of a king\u2019s edict, all smiles are gone, but they aren\u2019t replaced with grimaces and weeping. The emotional arc of the show belongs to the sweeping, gorgeous ebb and flow of composer Hiroko Tanakawa\u2019s original music (performed on an array of instruments spread out along the backside of the pool by Miyagi\u2019s multitalented cast), while the actors themselves function more like priests or shamans, somehow tranquil even in their evocation of defiance and disaster. Micari, the single-named performer who physically represents Antigone, spends the majority of the show aloft on the central stack of rocks rising from the set\u2019s great pool. Her speaker, Maki Honda, kneels in the water and intones for her while she stretches and bends on her precarious perch \u2014 it\u2019s a prison, but one she\u2019s chosen \u2014 her enormous shadow thrown against the Armory\u2019s back wall. Though Honda\u2019s voice soars and dips, neither actor registers conventional emotion on her face. Sometimes, Micari turns her back to us for long passages, so that her looming shadow is the most expressive of the three Antigones Miyagi has created. Antigone\u2019s betrothed, the idealistic, doomed young prince Haemon (speaker, Daisuke Wakana; mover, Yoneji Ouchi) never touches his beloved \u2014 they\u2019re trapped on separate islands, separated by yards of water, but their shadows mingle and merge on the wall behind.\n\nThe beauty of Miyagi\u2019s Antigone is that it seeks an image vocabulary for death that allows for dispassionate but not unkind reflection upon the living. Late in the play, when the stubborn king Creon receives tragic news, his speaker, Kazunori Abe, lets out two wracked, prolonged screams, while his mover, Kouichi Ohtaka, goes weak at the knees and reaches skyward, his face all stone. It\u2019s a marvelous moment. We aren\u2019t being asked to feel Creon\u2019s pain. We\u2019re being shown how strange, how distant, how loud and yet how small human suffering must look to the gods, or to the dead.\n\nAntigone is at the Park Avenue Armory through October 6.", "description": "Theater Review: Sophocles\u2019 Antigone, Reinterpreted by Satoshi Miyagi, Performed at the Park Avenue Armory", "authors": ["Sara Holdren"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/26/26-antigone.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
