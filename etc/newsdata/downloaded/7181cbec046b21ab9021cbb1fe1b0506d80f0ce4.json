Balancing the desired style and functionality of a lamp can be hard! Lamps may seem like trivial things, but we use them every day and that means we should get some kind of enjoyment out of them. If you\u2019ve been on the hunt for a bedside lamp that speaks to you on a design level as well as a function level, we\u2019ve compiled some of the best you can get on Amazon.\n\nRivet Dome-Shaped Table Lamp, $60: This sleek, elegant lamp is one that you may even want to show off in your living room instead of keeping next to your bed. The metal dome and curved base are smooth and it even has two bulb sockets and pull-chains so you can decide just how bright you want it.\n\nAUKEY Table Lamp, $28: If you want all the bells and whistles in your bedside lamp, this is the one for you. It\u2019s touch-activated, meaning you can easily control the brightness levels. Plus, the LED light is RGB, meaning you can have a rainbow of color options without buying an additional bulb.\n\nMUTUW Wooden Swing Arm Desk Lamp, $30: This is my favorite bedside lamp, even if it\u2019s technically a \u201cdesk lamp\u201d. The wooden arm is adjustable and the black-and-white cord is just really good-looking. I love it most because it reminds me of the Pixar lamp.\n\nHAITRAL Small Bedside Table Lamp, $26: This is a simple but interesting-looking lamp. The tripod-style wooden legs add some modernity to the linen shade and the cord has an on/off switch that you can place at your convenience.\n\nSOTTAE Modern Ceramic Bedside Table Lamp, $34: There\u2019s something so satisfying about this lamp. The geometric, ceramic body is crisp and smooth. The all-white shade/base combo means you can put this lamp in any style of bedroom with ease.\n\nLimelights LT2024-WHT Brushed Steel Lamp with Charging Outlet, $19: It may look simple but this best-selling lamp has a powerful secret. Built into the base of the lamp is an extra power outlet to plug a phone charger into if you need the additional space.\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
