Well, not really, sort of. The Facebook-owned social media platform has updated its app for iOS 13 with support for dark mode.\n\nThe setting is an extension of iOS\u2018 system-wide dark mode, and Instagram has basically revamped its UI to match the theme.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t already caught a glimpse, here\u2019s what it looks like:\n\nNo surprises there, it\u2019s the standard combo of black and grey, mixed with white text and icon layouts.\n\nHow to turn on dark mode\n\nTo get the dark look, you\u2019ll need to enable iOS 13\u2018s own dark mode. That seems to be the only way for now, since Instagram has yet to include a native switch in its app.\n\nAnyways, here are the steps you need to follow:\n\nPull the control center on your iPhone\n\nLong-press on the brightness indicator\n\nSelect dark mode from the toggle options below to enable it\n\nBoom! You\u2019re done\n\nAlternatively, you can ask Siri to enable dark mode by uttering the magic phrase \u201cHey Siri, turn on/off the dark mode.\u201d\n\nA third way to do it is by going to Settings > Display & Brightness, and then tapping on the \u201cDark\u201d theme option. As easy as that.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve used any of these three approaches, Instagram will automatically switch to dark mode too.\n\nUnfortunately, Instagram\u2018s dark mode is currently exclusively available on iOS. Don\u2019t fret, though: it seems that the Facebook subsidiary is testing the feature on Android, so chances are it\u2019ll make its way to Google\u2019s operating system soon.", "description": "Instagram has updated its app for iPhone with a dark mode that matches iOS 13's system-wide dark theme.
