Music has always been a way for people to connect and communicate. It\u2019s part of being human and a language we all share. Thanks to technology, that language is evolving \u2014 fast.\n\nThis season, join me, Dani Deahl, as we break open some of music\u2019s wildest moments and biggest trends, including Steve Aoki and global K-pop phenomenon Monsta X, how superstar producers Andr\u00e9s and Mauricio have embraced sampling, and Charli XCX on what it means to be a successful, modern pop star. We\u2019re looking at how blockbuster films are scored, examining how streaming changed the way we listen, and digging into why music is becoming more global. First up is an exclusive, behind-the-scenes look at DJ Eric Prydz\u2019s multistory Holosphere.\n\nIn the first season of The Future of Music, we went into startups, studios, and even musicians\u2019 homes to see how tech is impacting and, in some cases, reshaping music entirely. I went inside Imogen Heap\u2019s virtual reality concert, talked with producer Oak Felder about how radio hits can be made on phones and laptops, learned how to circuit bend Furbies with Look Mum No Computer, and tried out music-making AI software.\n\nThe convergence of music and tech continues to get deeper \u2014 so what does that mean for artists, listeners, and the music itself? We\u2019re going to find out.\n\nThe first episode of Future of Music season 2 will be available August 20th.
