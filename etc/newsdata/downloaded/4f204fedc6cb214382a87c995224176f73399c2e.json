They're dead. As far as I'm concerned, they're dead,\" Trump said. \"They thought they had to kill people in order to put them in a little better negotiating position. You can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t do that with me.\"\n\nTrump's comments come after he called off a secret meeting with Taliban leaders scheduled at Camp David over the weekend.\n\nUnbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday. They were coming to the United States tonight. Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, they admitted to.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2019\n\n....only made it worse! If they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don\u2019t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway. How many more decades are they willing to fight? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2019\n\nAccording to officials, the murder of Sgt. 1st Class Elis Angel Barreto Ortiz last week was a final straw after months of attacks and ramped up violence from the terrorist group. In the past year, 16 U.S. soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan.\n\nThe U.S. service member killed in a suicide car bomb blast in Kabul on Thursday has been identified as Sgt. 1st Class Elis Angel Barreto Ortiz of Morovis, Puerto Rico. https://t.co/SCgNHV4zG8 \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) September 7, 2019\n\nBefore his remarks, Trump tweeted about the use of force in Afghanistan, which has been reportedly ramped up as the Taliban vows to fight for \"100 years.\" More than 1000 Taliban members have been killed in the past ten days.\n\nWe have been serving as policemen in Afghanistan, and that was not meant to be the job of our Great Soldiers, the finest on earth. Over the last four days, we have been hitting our Enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2019\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo did a number of high profile interviews on Sunday to discuss the issue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made enormous progress over the last months working with the Afghan government of national unity, other Afghans, as well as with the Taliban. We had a number of objectives. The President's mission set for the State Department has always been negotiate a resolution that allows America to have less risk to our young men and women. I was out at Dover Air Force Base a handful of hours ago with Sergeant First Class Barreto's wife and two kids. He was a great American serving in the 82nd Airborne who was killed this past week,\" Pompeo said on ABC News. \"It\u2019s a reminder that we got to get it right. We\u2019ve got to protect American national security interests so that terror can never strike again from Afghanistan and at the same time reduce America\u2019s treasure and blood that we've given for almost two decades.\"\n\n\"We\u2019ve made progress. We had a commitment from the Taliban that said that they would break from Al Qaeda publicly and permanently. We had a commitment that said that they would reduce violence. George, you were in an administration that would try to get Afghans to sit at the table,\" he continued. \"We had a commitment that they would meet in Oslo to begin reconciliation conversations. Then the Taliban overreached. They killed an American in an effort to gain leverage at the negotiating table. President Trump said enough.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump continues to grapple with fulfilling his campaign promise to leave Afghanistan while ensuring the country isn't used to launch terrorist attacks, like 9/11, against the United States.", "description": ".09/09/2019 19:20:15PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/193/4626dbce-2548-4af0-97bc-232a1a530f00.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
