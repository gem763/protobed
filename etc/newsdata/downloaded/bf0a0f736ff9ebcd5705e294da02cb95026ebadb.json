This includes enduring strict and rigorous testing for cyclic wind pressure loading, small and large missile impact resistance, burn rates, and uniform static air pressure.

Under NOA standards, Cape Cod Perfection is certified to have successfully passed all rigorous testing criteria. Cape Cod Perfection has also earned a permanent label noting the acceptance by Miami-Dade County.\n\n\u201cThe NOA acceptance from Miami-Dade County speaks to Cape Cod Perfection\u2019s durability under the most extreme conditions, including severe coastal winds,\u201d said Ralph Bruno, CEO of Derby Building Products, Tando\u2019s parent company. \u201cLast year, we were proud to earn a Miami-Dade acceptance for Beach House Shake, a product with the unparalleled look of fresh-cut or weathered cedar. Both of these products\u2019 resistance to moisture, and ability to stand up to any kind of weather, make them ideal for coastal regions as well as inland projects.\u201d\n\nCape Cod Perfection features an aesthetically pleasing 5\u201d exposure, subtle wood texture with crisp, square edges, and offers a look that is nearly identical to painted wood shakes. Cape Cod Perfection\u2019s five solid colors include Classic White, Ashwood Gray, Slate Gray, Wheat, and Mariner Blue, a lifestyle shade that is very popular in coastal designs. All of the colors complement a wide range of exterior products and provide stunning results.\n\nUnlike other products that require the addition of screws or extreme installation techniques such as face-fastening to meet Miami-Dade requirements, standard roofing nails work well with Cape Cod Perfection. The only installation modification needed is to increase the number of nails per panel and fasten at each anchor point.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely proud to see Cape Cod Perfection and Beach House Shake finally being recognized for their ability to perform beyond the toughest industry standards,\u201d said Bruno.
