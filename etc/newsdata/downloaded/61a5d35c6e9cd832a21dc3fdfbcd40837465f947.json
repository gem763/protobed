Automakers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to California, you will be out of business,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote.\n\nThe president said there will be \u201cvery little difference in emissions\u201d between the California standard and the new U.S. standard, which is part of Mr. Trump\u2019s push to roll back Obama-era regulations.\n\nCalifornia is allowed to set its own tougher emissions standards under a waiver given it by Congress when it passed the Clean Air Act in 1970.\n\nThe decision could have wide reverberations \u2014 12 states and the District of Columbia follow California\u2019s lead in setting standards \u2014 and it could set the stage for a pivotal court battle over states\u2019 abilities to regulate greenhouse gas emissions released from tailpipes.\n\nDemocrats called Mr. Trump\u2019s decision absurd.\n\nAutomakers Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW voluntarily agreed to increase fuel efficiency and cut emissions in a bid to combat climate change, they said, so Mr. Trump is effectively asked them to pollute more.\n\n\u201cIn the Trump era, we are frequently confronted with the absurd \u2014 this is beyond ridiculous,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer. \u201cThis president is the leader of the self-proclaimed party of states\u2019 rights, yet he\u2019s blocking states from setting their own standards. This president has repeated that \u2018we have the cleanest air, the cleanest water,\u2019 almost like a mantra, yet he\u2019s trying to prevent California and other states from cleaning up their air pollution.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
