So if people have rabbits and guinea pigs as pets in their backyards, the snake is going to be looking for that.\"\n\nMr Cade said the snake had \"more than likely been bred in Australia\" and kept as an illegal pet.\n\nBoa constrictors are considered to be one of the world's largest snakes, with an average length of around 3m and weight of 10-15kg (22-33lb).\n\nThe species originates from Central and South America, including northern Mexico and north-western Argentina.\n\nYou may also be interested in:", "description": "\"This thing would take a full-sized kangaroo mate, no problem,\" a local snake catcher says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E1DE/production/_109222875_snakeskinfoundinsydney.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
