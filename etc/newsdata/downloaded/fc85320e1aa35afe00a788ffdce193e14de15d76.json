He is pictured with former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, whose campaign he donated to in 2015\n\nZuberi, a longtime political donor, has supported candidates from both parties in the past. He is seen with former President Barack Obama (left) and former Vice President Joe Biden (right)\n\n'Mr Zuberi's multi-faceted scheme allowed him to line his pockets by concealing the fact that he was representing foreign clients, obtaining access for clients by making a long series of illegal contributions, and skimming money paid by his clients,' United States Attorney Nick Hanna said.\n\n'Mr Zuberi circumvented laws designed to insulate US policy and our election process from foreign intervention.\n\n'This investigation has halted his illegal conduct, will result in several felony convictions, and could send him to prison for a lengthy period of time.'\n\nProsecutors did not specify which candidates received the illegal money funneled from foreign entities between September 2011 and November 2016.\n\nZuberi, a longtime political donor, has supported candidates from both parties over the years - including former Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton in 2015, Republican Sen Lindsay Graham in 2014 and then-California attorney general Kamala Harris in 2015.\n\nHe threw his financial weight behind Trump in the last presidential election election.\n\nCharging documents did not disclose the source the $900,000 he donated to the Trump inaugural committee in December 2016.\n\nZuberi threw his financial weight behind Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

And how could he? They didn't have a deal.'\n\nCohen is currently serving a three-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to charges of tax evasion and campaign finance fraud stemming from the Russia investigation.", "description": "Imaad Zuberi pleaded guilty to multiple charges including failing to register as a foreign agent, making nearly $1million in illegal campaign donations and tax evasion in Los Angeles federal court on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Megan Sheets For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/23/20059816-0-image-a-39_1571785011831.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
