Shortly after the release of an explosive memo showing Trump pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, the administration appeared to accidentally send its talking points on the scandal to House Democrats.\n\nThe talking points encouraged the president\u2019s political allies to argue that there was no direct quid pro quo conveyed in the memo and that the whistleblower complaint was handled \u201cby the book\u201d.\n\nMatt Fuller (@MEPFuller) Here are the White House talking points on the Ukraine call.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a master class in straw man arguments. pic.twitter.com/Dugxee7seS\n\n\u201cThe case just shows another example of the \u2018Deep State\u2019, the media, and the Democrats in Congress damaging our national security by leaking confidential information,\u201d they go on to say.\n\nAfter realizing the error, the White House sent another email to House Democrats, this time requesting to \u201crecall\u201d the original message.\n\nJennifer Bendery (@jbendery) Here's a screenshot of the White House asking House Democrats to please disregard the talking points on Trump/Ukraine they just emailed them pic.twitter.com/55HgOESWyL\n\nHowever, it was too late, and shortly after the mistake was made screenshots of the talking points quickly spread on social media, catching the interest of many, including Bernie Sanders:\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders (@SenSanders) The White House sent us their talking points around President Trump\u2019s Ukraine call.\n\n\n\nFor some strange reason, they forgot to mention that Mr. Trump said, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though\u201d after Zelensky brought up military aid. pic.twitter.com/60PMZ6aKcv\n\nUS Rep Brendan Boyle (@RepBrendanBoyle) I would like to thank @WhiteHouse for sending me their talking points on how best to spin the disastrous Trump/Zelensky call in Trump\u2019s favor. However, I will not be using their spin and will instead stick with the truth.\n\nBut thanks though.\n\n\n\nWhile the Democratic party is yet to officially confirm whether they disregarded the email or not, the evidence suggests that it may now be too late.", "description": "White House sent another email requesting to \u2018recall\u2019 original message \u2013 evidence suggests it may now be too late", "authors": ["Joan E Greve", "Max Benwell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13fdb0d6bbf75c582cef9be7892b229bfadf1409/0_254_4232_2539/master/4232.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7eaa1afbad5bae255cc5aea2af555581", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
