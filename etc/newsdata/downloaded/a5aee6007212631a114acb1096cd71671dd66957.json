But the Duchess of Sussex has also made waves for her clothing choices, specifically her affinity for wearing designers that focus on sustainability (as evidenced by her choice to wear Stella McCartney for her wedding reception).\n\nSince becoming a member of the British royal family, Meghan has also helped put a spotlight on smaller and lesser-known labels, including ethical denim company Outland Denim, the London-based fashion brand, Safiyaa, the upcycled sneaker brand, Veja, and jewelry designer Pippa Small.\n\nShe\u2019s also a known outfit-repeater, and doesn\u2019t seem to have any qualms about wearing the same garment more than once \u2014 like she\u2019s done during this month\u2019s royal tour of Africa with Prince Harry. The trip has also given Meghan ample opportunities to showcase her favorite ethical designers. Here\u2019s a look at all of Meghan\u2019s sustainable outfits from the tour.\n\nMeghan kicked things off by wearing a black and white patterned dress from Myamiko, a fair trade brand from Malawi.\n\nPhoto: Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nDuring a visit to the international charity Action Aid on October 1, Meghan wore a belted shirtdress from the ethical brand Room 502.\n\nPhoto: Mark Large/Getty Images\n\nOn September 24, Meghan visited the Auwal Mosque wearing an olive-colored \u201cMillie dress\u201d from the label Staud. The maxi dress is made from recycled nylon.\n\nPhoto: Tim Rooke/REX/Shutterstock/Getty Images\n\nOne of the aforementioned outfit-repeating moments was the striped Martin Grant maxi she wore to a reception at the Residence of the British High Commissioner in Cape Town.\n\nPhoto: Paul Edwards/Getty Images\n\nShe was also seen in the same blue Veronica Beard dress she wore during a trip to Tonga last year.\n\nPhoto: Pool/Getty Images\n\nTo meet with women entrepreneurs in Cape Town at the Woodstock Exchange, Meghan opted for a $120 jumpsuit from Everlane.\n\nPhoto: Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nDuring a visit to Monwabisi Beach in Cape Town, Markle wore a Madewell denim jacket, which was naturally deemed a \u201cRoyal FIRST.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nStay in touch.
