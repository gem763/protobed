Specifically, she took issue with Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s call for mandatory buybacks of assault-style weapons like the AR-15 and AK-47.\n\n\u201cI would also remind those that might not have a use for a gun or don\u2019t feel they have a use for a gun, many Americans do,\u201d Lahren told Fox Business anchor Stuart Varney. \u201cMany Americans don\u2019t live in the suburbs, who are far away from where police can respond, and so that\u2019s why that self-defense is so important.\u201d\n\nAnd then she brought the threat of \u201copen borders\u201d immigration into the mix.\n\n\u201cAnd all the things the Democrats want to put in place\u2014my goodness, if they want to open our borders, you better be sure the people in Texas, the people in South Dakota, the people in the middle of this country, we are going to be armed and ready,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cBecause we have to have a means to defend ourselves from\u2014who knows who\u2019s coming in? That\u2019s the thing, we don\u2019t know, and we have to be able to protect ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe right-wing provocateur\u2019s insistence that guns are needed to stave off migrants heading into the U.S. comes barely a month after the El Paso mass shooting that left 22 dead. The suspected shooter admitted that he was targeting \u201cMexicans\u201d and apparently posted a racist manifesto in which he decried the \u201cHispanic invasion\u201d of America.\n\nThis also isn\u2019t the first time that Lahren has fear-mongered over supposed \u201copen borders\u201d immigration. Earlier this year, she devoted a monologue to warning Fox viewers that an extremely high border wall was needed because immigrants are \u201cshifty and adaptable.\u201d", "description": "\u201cWho knows who\u2019s coming in?
