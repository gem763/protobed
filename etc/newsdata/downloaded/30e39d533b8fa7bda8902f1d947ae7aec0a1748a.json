Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d The tweet has since been deleted.\n\nBut the backlash in China has been swift and comprehensive. Chinese state television and Tencent, the two major broadcasters of NBA matches in China, have both said they will not be showing any Rockets games in future.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe club\u2019s sponsor and sportswear partner in China, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank and the brand Li-Ning respectively, said they would be suspending cooperation with the team, as did the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\nThe threat of commercial damage \u2013 the Tencent streaming deal alone is worth $1.5bn to the association over the next five years \u2013 forced both the NBA and Mr Morey to make public apologies.\n\nSpeaking early on Monday from Tokyo, where the Rockets have a game coming up, Mr Morey said he had reconsidered his stance \u201chav[ing] had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives\u201d.\n\nIn a new Twitter thread, he said his posts did not represent the team or the league. \u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offence to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event.\u201d\n\nIn an English-language statement, the NBA said it was \u201cregrettable\u201d that Mr Morey\u2019s views \u201cdeeply offended\u201d many in China.\n\nBut on its main Chinese-language social media pages, the NBA went much further, saying it was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by Mr Morey\u2019s \u201cinappropriate\u201d tweet about Hong Kong, which \u201cseverely hurt the feelings of Chinese fans\u201d.\n\nThat phrase \u2013 \u201churt feelings\u201d \u2013 is commonly used by the Chinese authorities when taking umbrage on behalf of the nation to a perceived gaffe by a foreign brand or party.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The company was forced to issue a statement saying it \u201cresolutely respect[s] China\u2019s territory and national sovereignty\u201d, and all the offending items of clothing \u2013 valued at almost \u00a3350 each \u2013 were symbolically destroyed.\n\nLast year, Dolce & Gabbana suffered a backlash after running an advert depicting a model eating spaghetti with chopsticks. The company has since reportedly struggled to get Chinese web retailers to stock its clothes.\n\nThe NBA and the Houston Rockets\u2019 attempts to backtrack have themselves been met with anger and disappointment online.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

candidate, tweeted: \u201cAs a lifelong Houston Rockets fan I was proud to see [Daryl Morey] call out the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s repressive treatment of protestors in Hong Kong.

You know, we love China, we love playing there. For both of us individually, we go there once or twice a year. They show us the most important love. We appreciate them as a fan base.
