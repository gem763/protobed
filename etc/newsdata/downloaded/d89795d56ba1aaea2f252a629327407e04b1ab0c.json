Although you can do a lot of running, which we have been doing, nothing compares to match fitness, so it'll be good to get some game time under the belt.\"\n\nBehind Retallick and the pack will stand makeshift fly-half Jordie Barrett, the youngest of the All Blacks' three Barrett brothers who will try out as cover for regular 10s Richie Mo'unga and his eldest sibling, Beauden.\n\nJordie Barrett, 22, has been thrown in the deep end, after being given only two days to practise at fly-half -- where he hasn't started a game since university.\n\n\"He has been doing a lot of what we have been doing at training anyway but he has not necessarily run at 10 prior to this morning,\" Hansen said on Friday.\n\n\"He has plenty of swagger. He's not short of it. I don't think you can mistake swagger or confidence with arrogance,\" he added.\n\nAsked what adjustments he had to make in the short time available, Jordie Barrett said: \"I guess there's a few but, within our game plan, the 15 often performs a 10 role in our phase play. \"So it's more just set piece and little things, timings I'll have to equip myself with over the next 48 hours so I can perform them on Sunday.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Brodie Retallick has faced unhappy times since winning the 2015 Rugby World Cup but the All Blacks lynchpin will make a timely return from injury on Sunday as New Zealand close in on the quarterfinals.
