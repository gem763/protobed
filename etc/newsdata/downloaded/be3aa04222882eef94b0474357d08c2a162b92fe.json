Big upset! Now @EddieRispone, who will be a great Governor, will win!'\n\nWith six candidates running for governor in the state, incumbent Democrat John Bel Edwards was not able to earn enough support to automatically be reelected to office, and instead is forced into a runoff election in November where he will face Republican Eddie Rispone, who has Trump's backing.\n\nThe president held a rally in Louisiana this week to drum up support for the Republican candidate in a state where Trump won with 58.1 per cent of the vote in the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nDonald Trump touted a Republican victory in the Saturday Louisiana primary race, where the Democrat incumbent was prevented from an outright victory\n\nOn Friday, Trump held a rally in Louisiana where both Republican primary candidates Eddie Rispone and Ralph Abraham attended\n\nTrump congratulated Rispone after he earned the biggest percentage of the Republican vote in the state\n\n'The Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, has done a poor job. NOW HE IS IN A RUNOFF WITH A GREAT REPUBLICAN, @EddieRispone,' Trump boasted Saturday night as he took credit for helping keep the Democrat from victory. 'Thank you Louisiana! 66% down to 47% after I explained what a bad job the Governor was doing.'\n\nEdwards earned 46.6 per cent of the vote in Louisiana \u2013 just 3.4 per cent short of the 50 per cent needed to clinch victory \u2013 and Rispone earned 27.4 per cent.\n\nRalph Abraham, another Republican who ran in the gubernatorial elections, garnered 23.6 per cent of the vote, and if that section of the vote went toward Rispone in the November runoff, he could emerge victorious.\n\nAbraham is a third-term congressman and Rispone a businessman and longtime political donor who is making his first bid for office.\n\nThe other three candidates earned only .8 per cent of the vote each.\n\nIn the early morning hours of Sunday, Trump predicted Rispone would win in November, flipping the governor's office in Louisiana red.\n\n'Congratulations to the Great State of Louisiana. A big night. You will soon have a new and wonderful Governor, @EddieRispone,' he tweeted. 'Your Taxes and Car Insurance Payments will go DOWN!'\n\nDuring Trump's rally Friday, both Rispone and Abraham attended, claiming they have support from the president. But Trump did not endorse either candidate outright, so he could maximize the changes that Edwards would fall below the 50 per cent threshold \u2013 which worked.", "description": "Donald Trump boasted Sunday morning another win for Republicans and a 'big upset' for Democrats following the gubernatorial Louisiana elections that resulted in a forced runoff.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/15/19656248-0-image-a-13_1570975446686.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
