Janie Barrett\n\nAllan Gray chief investment officer Simon Mawhinney said the result was encouraging but the prospect of a successful turnaround was far from certain. He also questioned the need to raise capital.\n\n\u201cWe would have preferred them to dig into their $1.7 billion excess capital than to tap shareholders but it appears that many wanted this capital raising,\u201d Mr Mawhinney said.\n\nAMP will offer equity at $1.50 a share or a 13.3 per cent discount to the closing price on Wednesday. A book build with institutional investors was underway and retail investors will be given the opportunity to subscribe up to $15,000 worth of shares.\n\nThe company is betting on making $300 million in savings annually with $75 million coming from more efficient operations including job cuts, $50 million from a learner corporate structure and $175 million coming from simplification of its legacy business including aligned advisers.\n\nAMP\u2019s Mr De Ferrari said the company would have fewer advisers in the future and implied as many as 800 of its 2400 advisers could depart but declined to say it was targeting a specific number.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the number that counts it\u2019s the quality of the advice\u201d Mr De Ferrari said.\n\nHe said he was confident of getting the deal across the line after it was scuttled by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand last month, saying the company was having \u201cconstructive discussions\u201d with the relevant regulators and \u201cmaking significant progress\u201d.\n\nAMP has also picked a fight with the advisers it pays to sell its products by announcing it would no longer pay advisers four times earnings for advice businesses under the buyer of last resort or BOLR program.\n\nThe decision to raise $650 million in equity with the share price at record lows has also raised eyebrows. AMP shares were as high as $6 three years ago and closed at $1.73 before going into a trading halt on Thursday morning.\n\nMr De Ferrari defended the capital raising as necessary and said the new strategy would not be possible with the additional investment.\n\n\u201cThat would have required a slowing of growth in the meantime and that was clearly not in the interest of shareholders and we think we are going to get very wide institutional support\u201d Mr De Ferrari said.\n\nAMP will invest up to $1.3 billion in the business over the next three years in its quest to reinvent itself and stake a claim over the customers the banks have abandoned.\n\n\u201cWe want to invest to build the best wealth management business in Australia and we feel we can take a leadership position because everyone else is exiting\u201d Mr De Ferrari said.\n\nStaff numbers at the company were also on the rise mainly on account of additional hires in remediation teams and compliance with the number of FTEs rising from 5977 at this time last year to 6505.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the appropriate level of return for the risk we are taking on\u201d Mr De Ferrari said.\n\nAMP's chief financial officer-elect John Patrick Moorehead will leave the business as part of the shake-up. His deputy James Georgeson will be taking over from retiring CFO Gordon Leferve with the handover to begin immediately.", "description": "The financial advice company's ambitious plan to reinvent itself will need everything to go right.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.1779%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_371/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/bea7988a43ee676d591f8a931e9b62204c24f5c8", "published_at": "2019-08-08"}
