Union heads and GM management had failed to agree on terms for new worker contracts, and were divided over issues of pay raises, health benefits, and job security.\n\n\u201cWe are standing up for the fundamental rights of working people in this country,\u201d said UAW negotiator Terry Dittes at the time. GM responded that, \u201cOur goal remains to build a strong future for our employees and our business.\u201d\n\nThe deal to end the strike, which has so far cost GM roughly $2 billion, will not go into effect immediately. The details still need to be reviewed by UAW committee heads, after which union members must vote on the proposal.\n\nSeveral Democratic presidential candidates, including Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have met with the striking autoworkers during the past month, and one, Beto O\u2019Rourke, even brought up the subject during Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic primary debate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met with these members of the UAW who are striking outside of facilities in Cincinnati, in Lordstown, Ohio, which has just been decimated by GM and their maleficence, paying effectively zero in taxes last year,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cThey want fairness in how we treat workers in this country, and they\u2019re not getting it.\u201d", "description": "The United Auto Workers union has reached a tentative deal with General Motors to end a month-long strike by 49,000 workers, the AP reported Wednesday.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
