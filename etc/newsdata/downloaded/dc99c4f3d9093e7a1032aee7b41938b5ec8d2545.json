De Blonay says:\n\n'To invest in UK banks, you ideally want interest rates to be rising and there to be no recession in sight. Neither of those conditions is being met.'\n\nHe also says that the Brexit factor is another negative. The fund's UK exposure, at 9 per cent, is currently limited to stakes in FTSE 100 listed London Stock Exchange Group and private equity specialists 3i and Intermediate Capital. De Blonay adds:\n\n'For the past three years, I have taken the view that low interest rates, here and in the rest of the world, will persist.\n\n'This creates big challenges for large banks and insurers. But there are plenty of financial companies out there who are thriving, either by embracing change and radically reducing costs, or by disrupting the way financial services are traditionally delivered.\n\n'Technological change will continue to drive growth in the global financial sector, whether it is a result of companies embracing or adopting it \u2013 or companies enabling such change to happen through new innovations and services.'\n\nCompanies involved in the processing of electronic payments \u2013 a growing market \u2013 feature strongly in the fund. They include US companies Global Payments, Visa, Mastercard, Fiserv and Fidelity National Information \u2013 all top 10 fund holdings by size.\n\nA number of these companies, says de Blonay, have benefited from taking over rivals \u2013 for example, Fidelity's recent acquisition of competitor Worldpay and Fiserv's purchase of First Data \u2013 and further industry consolidation is inevitable.\n\nAmong the adopters of technology is Topdanmark, Denmark's second largest insurance company and a key holding in Financial Opportunities. De Blonay says: 'Twenty per cent of motor claims are now dealt with by Topdanmark over the internet via artificial intelligence.'\n\nOver the past five years, the fund has produced an impressive overall return of 90 per cent. The annual ongoing charge is a tad over one per cent.", "description": "Most experts believe now is not a good time to have exposure to a portfolio of financial stocks.
