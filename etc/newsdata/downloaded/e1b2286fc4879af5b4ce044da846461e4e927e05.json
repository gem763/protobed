In short order, Kroger, Walgreens, Wegmans and CVS said they too would discourage shoppers from openly carrying guns in their stores.\n\nThe response from corporate America followed back-to-back tragedies in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, that left 31 people dead last month and a shooting in Odessa, Texas, that left seven people dead.\n\nNow, activists say, it\u2019s time for Washington to step up and stop politicians from lagging behind corporate America when it comes to gun reforms.\n\n\u201cWhen consumer-facing corporations make moves like this, there is no better statement of the shifting opinion of the American public,\u201d said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety. \u201cCongress needs to pass a strong background check law and a strong red flag law. Anything less and the mood of the country will be \u2018See you at the polling booth in 2020.\u2019\u201d\n\nEverytown released new data on Friday indicating overwhelming support for new stricter gun laws. The poll found that 95% of Americans nationwide backed universal background checks and 85% favored the passage of so-called \u201cred flag\u201d laws, which are designed to prohibit individuals from purchasing firearms if they are deemed a threat to themselves or others. A 61% majority of Americans blamed gun violence on easy access to firearms.\n\n\u201cThis broad public support shouldn\u2019t come as any surprise to lawmakers,\u201d Feinblatt said. \u201cJust look back to November 2018 \u2013 if the midterms taught us anything, it\u2019s that suburban voters resoundingly chose pro-gun sense candidates.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re ready to vote out politicians who don\u2019t take action to keep them safe.\u201d\n\nCongressional Democrats hope to create momentum by ramping up pressure on the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, to allow a vote on legislation passed by the House earlier this year that would strengthen and expand background checks.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters call for firearms control and protest against gun violence, at a rally in Los Angeles on 17 August 2019.

Later next week, the House judiciary committee will prepare a slate of gun control bills to be brought to the floor for a vote.\n\nThe committee will consider a suite of measures that would ban high-capacity magazines, establish a federal grant program for states that implement red flag laws, and prohibit firearm sales to people convicted of certain misdemeanor hate crimes.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is engaged in a conversation with Senators Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, and Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, about expanding background checks.\n\nSenators Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat of Connecticut, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican of South Carolina, are also working with the White House on legislation that would offer grants to states that pass \u201cred flag\u201d laws.\n\nIt is unclear whether Trump supports any of these efforts. The president has repeatedly shifted positions on the issue, at some points expressing support for tightening background checks only to later backtrack and insist current laws are sufficient.\n\nWhere Trump lands on the proposals under consideration will determine the success of the latest push for gun reform in Congress. McConnell told the Hugh Hewitt radio show earlier this week that he would only hold votes on measures Trump was prepared to support.\n\n\u201cIf the president took a position on a bill so that we knew we would actually be making a law and not just having serial votes,\u201d McConnell said, \u201cI\u2019d be happy to put it on the floor.\u201d\n\nYet at the congressional level, lawmakers remain intractably divided on how to respond, with Democrats advocating for gun control legislation and Republicans pointing to mental health and violent video games.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to the flurry of activity taking place in state legislatures to loosen or tighten gun regulations. In Texas, a day after the state was shaken by its second mass shooting in less than a month, a spate of new laws went into effect loosening restrictions on when and where firearms could be carried.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has said he will only bring gun control legislation to the vote if Donald Trump has indicated he backs it.

In the 1990s, when working-class, rural voters were still a key constituency, the party was bitterly divided over the issue and preferred to downplay it.\n\nBut now Democrats believe guns could be a defining issue in 2020, as they make gains with suburban voters, especially college-educated women fearful for their children\u2019s safety in school.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in more than two decades, we believe that guns could be an issue that matters in a real and positive way for Democrats,\u201d said Matt Bennett, executive vice-president for public affairs at Third Way, a centrist Democratic thinktank.\n\nBut Bennett worries Democrats risk alienating voters frustrated with Trump\u2019s presidency if they go too far with measures like licensing and gun buybacks.\n\n\u201cThe danger is that we\u2019re moving away from ideas that have near-universal support among voters to ones that have closer to 50% support,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cCongress hasn\u2019t done anything for 25 years, so maybe we should start with something that\u2019s universally popular.\u201d\n\nBut many advocates believe the moment for bold reform is now.\n\n\u201cThe center has shifted on this issue,\u201d said Igor Volsky, executive director and founder of Guns Down America, which organizes for \u201ca future with fewer guns\u201d. \u201cThe approach we\u2019re seeing now reflects the political reality and the political environment that we\u2019re living in.\u201d\n\nSabrina Siddiqui contributed reporting.", "description": "Retailers such as Walmart have taken a lead and public opinion appears in favour of new curbs but that may still count for little", "authors": ["Lauren Gambino"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5710da33a1a19b742ea59d5f3c5056333a3bb25d/0_59_4686_2812/master/4686.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=14245edfe44b3e78de95d1525bdbf616", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
