Last week, the agency\u2019s inspector general issued warnings over quality issues. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nMetro board leaders on Thursday proposed requiring future ethics investigations be made public, after the secrecy surrounding the recent inquiry into former board chairman Jack Evans drew widespread scorn.\n\nThe board\u2019s ethics committee also outlined plans to give the agency\u2019s inspector general a primary role in probes. And the panel said it wants to clarify what standard to use to determine whether board members have conflicts of interest.\n\nThe panel acted at one of several committee meetings where board members also expressed shock over the problems plaguing construction of Phase 2 of the Silver Line. Members predicted Metro would not be able to begin passenger service on the extension \u2014 which will bring service to Dulles International Airport and into Loudoun County \u2014 in July 2020 as the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority has been saying.\n\nMWAA is managing construction of the rail project, but it will be operated and managed by Metro once completed.\n\nMetro\u2019s inspector general has been conducting an independent review of work on the $5.8 billion project since problems surfaced last year, and he is expected to release a report later this year. However, recent discoveries were so concerning that he issued two management alerts last week so that the problems could be addressed immediately.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very comprehensive and shocking presentation,\u201d board member Michael Goldman said following a presentation Thursday from chief operating officer Joseph Leader, who reviewed a dozen quality problems with the project.\n\n\n\nMetro board Chairman Paul Smedberg also leads the group\u2019s ethics committee, which may update its practices after criticism of a recent probe. (Astrid Riecken for The Washington Post)\n\nGoldman said the report created a \u201cdark and foreboding cloud\u201d over the proposed July 2020 start date.\n\nAlternate board member Tom Bulger said the array of troubles reminded him of the problems with the ill-fated Silver Spring Transit Center.\n\n\u201cThis is deja vu for me. . . but this is way bigger than what we tackled at Silver Spring,\u201d Bulger said.\n\n[Metro\u2019s IG finds new problems with Silver Line construction]\n\nIn another development, Maryland Transportation Secretary Pete K. Rahn predicted the state would release $42 million in funding it has been withholding from Metro by the end of the month. The money has been withheld because of a dispute with the agency\u2019s management.\n\nRahn, who joined the Metro board in July, said Metro had met some of the conditions the state set to receive the money but that it would take longer to release an additional $13 million that the state is withholding.\n\nAt the start of Rahn\u2019s tenure on the board, he sent a strongly worded letter to General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld complaining the agency was \u201cstonewalling\u201d on audits and other issues. The state withheld $55.6 million in capital funds as a result.\n\nThe board resolved one of Maryland\u2019s concerns Thursday by approving a one-year capital funding plan to replace one that expired in June. It is set to resolve another concern at its Sept. 26 meeting by approving a dedicated funding agreement with Maryland.\n\n[Metro asks Maryland to release $56 million withheld in funding dispute.]\n\n\u201cAt that point, we can release the $42 million from the dedicated funds,\u201d Rahn said.\n\nThe remaining $13 million that Maryland is withholding depends on resolving disagreements over audits.\n\nRahn said he hoped to solve that problem \u201csoon,\u201d and Wiedefeld said that \u201cwe\u2019re moving along very nicely on that.\u201d\n\nBut the discussion of the ethics committee and its work consumed much of the meeting. The panel wants to change its procedures for investigating board members because of the chaos and controversy that surrounded its inquiry into Evans (D), who also is a D.C. Council member. The panel is expected to approve the changes and submit them to the full board Sept. 26.\n\n[Metro\u2019s clumsy Jack Evans probe would be laughable, except the stakes are so high.]\n\nThe four-member committee found in May that Evans had committed an ethics violation by failing to disclose a conflict of interest with Colonial Parking. But it initially kept the finding confidential and said there was no written record of its proceedings.\n\nThe secrecy allowed Evans and an ally on the ethics committee, former board member Corbett A. Price, to falsely claim that the panel had cleared Evans of any violation.\n\nThe committee\u2019s finding ultimately was made public under pressure from the governors of Maryland and Virginia, other officials, and board members not on the ethics committee. The Washington Post published a confidential 20-page memo of the probe\u2019s findings that was written by the outside law firm retained by the board to investigate Evans.\n\nThe scandal led Evans and Price to resign from the board.\n\nTo avoid a repeat of that embarrassing episode, board chairman Paul Smedberg, who also heads the ethics committee, said the proposed changes to the ethics code \u201care designed to improve transparency, accountability, clarity and fairness to all parties.\u201d\n\nThey provide that the ethics committee will make its actions public, even if conflicts of interest are quickly resolved such as by the board members recusing themselves from decisions.\n\nIf an investigation takes place, then the ethics committee must provide a public written report to the board, which then would meet to decide on a response.\n\n[Jack Evans to resign from Metro board after probe shows he \u2018knowingly\u2019 violated rules.]\n\n\u201cThe board then needs to convene a public session and discuss that report, and, if they found a violation, what, if any, sanctions the board feels is appropriate for the affected board member,\u201d Metro General Counsel Patricia Y. Lee said.\n\n\u201cThat would all be in public session,\u201d Lee said.\n\nThe proposed changes also provide that Metro\u2019s own inspector general would usually conduct ethics investigations, instead of hiring an outside law firm. Lee said that was consistent with best practices used by other transit agencies.\n\nThe panel also wants to specify that the standard for finding an ethics violation is \u201cwhether the evidence shows that it is more likely than not\u201d that the affected board member violated the code.\n\nThat change was in response to concerns raised by some ethics committee members during the Evans inquiry that it wasn\u2019t clear how strong the evidence needed to be to find a violation.", "description": "Board members also expressed shock over multiple construction woes with the Silver Line extension.", "authors": ["Robert Mccartney", "Senior Regional Correspondent Covering Government", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4nFiatdWRTDr5ZDoUR_ozvUy5TE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VTOXAJFEHUI6TJ3H26VYJLXT5E.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
