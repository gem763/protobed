Still it was never far from my side, like a mini homing device, its beeps and buttons tickling my neurons into a lifelong reliance.\n\nI say this is unhealthy more out of habit, because we are told it is, but in truth I don\u2019t buy into that scaremongering. My life, as far as I\u2019m concerned, has only ever been enriched by my phone - more so as the devices have got wizzier. These days, my deeply cherished iPhone is a 226-gram atlas, encyclopedia, calendar, wallet, rolodex, camera and clock. It is a satellite link to the rest of the world.
