This involved not only redundancies but remaining workers having to re-interview for their existing jobs.\n\nAccording to website VGC, there have also been redundancies in the U.S. creative services team, with some senior staff across the company leaving of their own volition. All of which is part of a process that began in 2016 when the PlayStation business was moved from Japan to America.\n\nSome of this smacks of office politics and executive power struggles, with the rapid rise of President and CEO Jim Ryan, who used to be based in the London offices, and the recent departure of PlayStation America figurehead Shawn Layden.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEuropean staff are reportedly already being left out of the loop and apparently had no idea about the PlayStation 5 revelations made, via U.S. publication Wired, this week until they happened \u2013 the same day as the redundancies were announced.\n\nThe move seems extremely unwise given that much of Sony\u2019s success with the PlayStation can be attributed to the way it\u2019s allowed local territories to oversee their own marketing and sign-up their own locally-made games.\n\nFrom WipeEout on the PlayStation 1 (which was never a major hit anywhere else in the world) to VR projects such as Blood & Truth, Sony Europe has always operated with a large degree of autonomy.\n\nThis contrasts with Microsoft\u2019s approach for Xbox, which is much more tightly controlled by America and has never seen major success in Japan or on the Continent.\n\nCentralising everything in America will potentially make things easier for third party publishers but it seems a needless mistake which removes what would have otherwise been a clear advantage for Sony in the next generation.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: PlayStation VR 2 wireless headset revealed in new Sony patent\n\nMORE: Sony unsure if PlayStation 5 backwards compatibility will cover every game\n\nMORE: PlayStation 5 name and Christmas 2020 release date confirmed", "description": "Sony may have just lost a significant advantage over Microsoft in the next gen console wars, as they sideline their European offices.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/sonybldg628x471_1570701895.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
