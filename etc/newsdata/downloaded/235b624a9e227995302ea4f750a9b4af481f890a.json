However, Boshoff he added a quirky jibe to his question.\n\n'I give you freedom to insult me'\n\n\"I am glad that the minister reaffirmed his commitment to the environmental and scientific consensus.\n\n\"For a moment, before this energy plan was announced, I thought he might be in cahoots with a highly regarded climatologist like Mr Donald Trump in being committed to a fossil fuel economy,\" said Boshoff, to some laughter in the National Assembly.\n\nMinister of Mineral Resources and Energy Gwede Mantashe did not take kindly to the quip and maintained that government was not in the business of driving the agenda of any specific energy technology but a just transition.\n\n\"Comparing me to Trump is an insult. But I give you the freedom to insult me.\n\n\"What I am saying is that the department is not a lobby group for any particular type of technology. We are still pursing a just transition as is outlined by the IRP,\" said Mantashe.\n\nMentioning the coal mining town of Hendrina in Mpumalanga, Mantashe said if all coal was decommissioned at once with too much haste, it would lay waste to towns which were built around collieries.", "description": "Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy Gwede Mantashe South Africa was not as developed as European and western economies and could not be held to the same standard as these advanced economies when it came to reducing emissions.", "authors": ["Khulekani Magubane"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9445/9682194bc5f940159a3300da5c53cf22.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
