It states: \"We can take a serious step towards reducing the harm this is causing our young women and girls by looking at our language -- and this starts with the dictionary.\"\n\nIt continues: \"This is completely unacceptable by a reputable source like the Oxford University Press, but it's even more worrying when you consider how much influence they have in setting norms around our language. These misogynistic definitions have become widespread because search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo license the use of Oxford Dictionaries for their definitions.\"\n\nGiovanardi told CNN that she herself had been subjected to online abuse -- and even rape threats -- since launching the petition. However, she said, the response has mostly been positive.\n\n\"The response has been great because we have received the support of some very big women's rights organizations,\" she told CNN. \"You have to expect a backlash, but generally I feel very supported.\"\n\nThe \"outdated\" definitions \"denigrate\" women, according to the petition, which requests that the definition is expanded to include broader examples, such as \"a transgender woman, a lesbian woman, etc.\"\n\nResponding to a request for comment, an OUP spokeswoman directed CNN to a blog post published last month on its website.\n\nIn a post entitled \"Mapping 'woman' in the Oxford Dictionary of English and Oxford Thesaurus of English,\" Katherine Connor Martin, OUP's head of lexical content strategy, said the content raised in the petition does not appear in the OED, but instead \"derives from the Oxford Thesaurus of English and the Oxford Dictionary of English, which aim to cover contemporary English usage and are accessible online in a variety of formats.\"\n\nShe said that editors are \"investigating whether there are senses of woman which are not currently covered but should be added in a future update.\"\n\nHowever, she explained that \"often there is a nuance to how words are defined and presented in our dictionaries, which is important to take into account.\"\n\nShe added: \"If there is evidence of an offensive or derogatory word or meaning being widely used in English, it will not be excluded solely on the grounds that it is offensive or derogatory.\n\n\"Part of the descriptive process is to make a word's offensive status clear ... The phrase 'the little woman' is defined as 'a condescending way of referring to one's wife' and 'bit' is labeled as 'derogatory' in the thesaurus.\"\n\nGiovanardi told CNN that the petitioners had not received a direct response from the publisher, adding that the blog post \"doesn't really address any of the concerns raised.\"\n\n\"In future, I think the solution is to come up with some limits as to what is actually considered too sexist or too abusive,\" she said. \"We want a serious commitment to changing the definition -- hopefully they will listen.\"", "description": "Tens of thousands of people have signed a petition calling on publisher Oxford University Press (OUP) to remove \"sexist\" terms for women.", "authors": ["Lianne Kolirin"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190918094320-woman-dictionary-definition-stock-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
