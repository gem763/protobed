I talked to the IVF nurse and she said it was probably just a side-effect of the treatment.\n\n\u201cBut a week later, there was an indentation in the breast and the nipple had gone in.\n\n\u201cI called the nurse again and she told me not to worry. But I decided to go with my gut instinct and went to the doctor, who fast-tracked me for extensive tests.\n\n\u201cBefore the word \u2018cancer\u2019 was even mentioned, I could see it in the doctor\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cMy first question was \u2018What\u2019s going to happen to my eggs\u2019? At that point, the most important thing to me was having a child. They told me not to panic.\u201d\n\nDuring tests, Mrs Newman also mentioned that she had been suffering back pains, so she was also referred for specialist imaging. A week later, she was called back.\n\n\u201cThe surgeon said to me \u2018I\u2019m really sorry, there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u2019 It was terrifying.\n\n\u201cWhat she was trying to say was that there was nothing she could do as a surgeon \u2013 I had stage 4 breast cancer which had spread. But it sent me into a blind panic.\n\nNicky Newman, left, and Laura Middleton-Hughes are also known as the Secondary Sisters (Simon Dack/Vervate/PA)\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know if I was going to live or die. The whole thing was an absolute blur.\u201d\n\nMrs Newman needed strong medication to control the pain and temporarily lost her ability to walk.\n\nHowever, she was put on the drug palbociclib (Ibrance), which had only just been approved on the NHS, and her disease is currently stable.\n\n\u201cMy oncologist told me that was a game-changer,\u201d Mrs Newman said.\n\n\u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been approved, my prognosis would have been very different.\u201d\n\nMrs Newman took three months off from her job at a finance brokerage.\n\n\u201cWhen I left hospital, I was grieving more for the fact that I had lost my chance to be a mother, than because I had cancer,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt was only six months down the line that I could finally say \u2018Oh my God, I have incurable cancer.\u2019\n\n\u201cThen I had to grieve again for the life I thought I would have, or should have had.\u201d\n\nMrs Newman and Mrs Middleton-Hughes met by chance through an online cancer community and bonded immediately.\n\nThey set up Secondary Sisters to \u201coffer information, hope and basically a bit of fun\u201d.\n\nMrs Newman added: \u201cThere are tough times, of course, and we don\u2019t shy away from that. But our focus is on living your life and living it well.\u201d\n\nMrs Middleton-Hughes was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014 after finding a lump in her left breast while on a dream holiday to Australia.\n\nShe underwent a mastectomy and chemotherapy and recovered, but began to feel pain in her right shoulder in April 2016.\n\nThe pain continued to get worse and her GP referred her for physiotherapy, and then eventually she had a scan.\n\nMedics found that a tumour had overtaken the head of the humerus \u2013 the long bone in the arm from the shoulder to the elbow.\n\nMrs Middleton-Hughes said: \u201cI didn\u2019t know at that point if it had spread anywhere else but immediately I feared it had and I had only weeks to live.\u201d\n\nShe underwent a shoulder replacement, which caused her agonising pain, and then started chemotherapy.\n\nAt present, she has traces of cancer in her spine, 12 vertebrae and pelvis. Her disease is currently stable, though incurable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very, very grateful that the treatment I\u2019m having is managing to give me a fairly normal life,\u201d she said.\n\nMrs Middleton-Hughes has had to give up the hairdressing job she loved but in April this year she married husband Brad.\n\nAs part of Stand Up To Cancer, both women have painted their bodies with words which characterise their battle with cancer, including \u201cpain\u201d, \u201cinfertility\u201d, \u201cfatigue\u201d and \u201cstage 4\u201d.\n\nThe campaign aims to unite scientists, celebrities and communities across the UK to raise cash for rapid new treatments.\n\nIt is supported by a host of celebrities including presenters Davina McCall and Maya Jama, comedians Alan Carr and Joe Lycett, and Olympic champion Greg Rutherford.\n\nLynn Daly, spokeswoman for Cancer Research UK, said: \u201cFaced with such a difficult prognosis, Nicky and Laura are being unbelievably brave and positive in sharing their very personal stories.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been amazing progress in the past few decades and more people are now surviving cancer than ever before.\n\n\u201cBut with one in two in the UK set to develop the disease at some point in our lives, and thousands and thousands of people in the same position as Nicky and Laura, there\u2019s still so much more to do.\n\n\u201cSupporting Stand Up To Cancer enables scientists to explore brave new ways to fight the disease and develop radical treatments, meaning more lives are saved.\u201d\n\nTo find out more about Stand Up To Cancer go to Standuptocancer.org.uk or channel4.co.uk/SU2C or follow the campaign on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.", "description": "The women met online and decided to found their own community called Secondary Sisters.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/00/wire-19418010-1570489437-889_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
