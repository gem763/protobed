Recent reports suggested that WeWork intended to delay its IPO, whereas others indicated the offering was going forward, full steam ahead.\n\nYet, the people best equipped to help the media and broader investing public open the box and collapse that uncertainty down to reality are no longer at The We Company.\n\nCrunchbase News learned, and Business Insider wrote about, of significant turnover within The We Company\u2019s central corporate communications team. Jennifer Skyler, the company\u2019s first comms hire, formally left last week after giving up the mantle in April to join American Express. Skyler\u2019s departure was followed shortly by her replacement, Dom McMullan, who also left last week after spending over three years at the company.\n\nBut the woes extend beyond The We Company\u2019s comms group. So let\u2019s get into them, chronologically.\n\nThe Market\u2019s Reprice\n\nOn September 3, reports came out that WeWork, which raised $12.8 billion in primary, secondary and debt financing, according to Crunchbase, might cut its valuation by tens of billions. The company last had a private valuation of $47 billion, and reports said the company would target a valuation of between $20 billion and $30 billion.\n\nAbout a week later, The Financial Times reported that SoftBank, which has invested billions in the company, has asked WeWork to shelve its IPO. Not a good look when the entity that trusted you with billions of dollars in venture capital tells you to slow down your roll.\n\nThen we learned that WeWork is shaking up is corporate governance and structure, which remains something of an organizational layer cake, before the IPO. The changes include re-weighting the supermajority voting shares held by Neumann and close associates from twenty times to merely ten times the voting weight of regular shareholders. Additionally, the board of directors now has the ability to fire Neumann, and Adam\u2019s spouse, Rebekah, will have a reduced role in picking his successor, should Neumann be fired or otherwise become unable to lead the company.\n\nAnd now we\u2019re here. WeWork\u2019s woes have caught up to it and made it take a breath.The controversial company, with staggering losses and a once historically-high valuation, isn\u2019t joining the IPO parade until at least October. And even then, its appearance might fall short of a march.\n\nIllustration: Li-Anne Dias", "description": "", "authors": ["Jason D.
