Lydia Bright is seen make-up free this year\n\nLydia Bright is seen in 2010 sporting heavier make-up and lashes and perfectly curled hair\n\nSpeaking to Femail, Beverly Piper, founder of Lash Perfect, told how the popularity of lash lifts - where lashes are curled around a perming rod - is skyrocketing.\n\nShe said: 'Lash enhancement treatments, such as lash extensions or lash lifting continue to grow in popularity and are set to be the number one trend in 2020.\n\n'They are excellent for people who want styled, great looking lashes without the need for wearing lots of mascara and eye make-up. We see that clients today are choosing to wear less make-up, while enhancing their lashes with these natural looking lifting treatments.\n\n'It's the ideal treatment for the softer, more natural look which has been popular on the catwalk and really 'opens' the eye. This treatment is quick, easy and requires little maintenance.\n\n'It can really enhance facial features as the lift and curl draws attention directly to the eyes making them 'pop'.\n\n'This shift in focus is a sure-fire way to give the eyes instant radiance and a more 'wide-awake' look. Some clients have started to opt for LPL instead of having 'tweakments' like botox around the eyes - we expect to see this increase in 2020.'\n\nTurning against the tweaked tide of perfectly highlighted cheekbones and the 'surprised' Botox look, an increasing number of women are now plumping towards a more effortless look. Michelle Keegan is seen this year - sporting a lash lift and no make-up\n\nMichelle Keegan is seen in 2009 with heavier make- up and a bouncy blow dry - before embracing the more natural look\n\nMeanwhile skin specialist Lena, who runs beauty salon Carasoin in Holllywood, said: 'Here in LA and especially with my high profile clients I've seen a real shift towards wanting to achieve natural, clean glowing skin, away from the over contoured, over injected and heavy makeup looks that we see all too often.\n\n'More and more clients want to glow from their own skin, and not through heavy makeup or augmented invasive procedures.\n\n'A carefully prescribed skincare regimen and a commitment regular facials, especially non invasive treatments, such as the CACI microcurrent (for muscle toning and Sculpting) or Radio frequency (for smoothing fine lines and building collagen) are now hugely popular for those who want results without the downtime or that obvious surgery look.'\n\nRochelle Humes, seen this year, recently embraced her natural curls and is seen showing off a stunning make-up free look\n\nRochelle Hunes was once famed for her poker straight styled hair before she spoke about the importance of going natural for her daughters\n\nWhat is LVL? What is LVL? LVL stands for length-volume-lift and involves lifting the natural lashes without losing length by curling them. How does it work? Technicians ensure the area is free of make-up before the client selects the size of the rod depending on how tight they want the curl. Once that is done they use lash glue to pin back the lashes, then apply a perming lotion which takes 20 minutes, and then a neutraliser which is left on for 15 minutes. It takes around 1 hour. How long does it last? About two months. Experts recommend you don't have treatment more frequently than every two months. Are there any warnings? Pregnant clients should wait until after the first trimester. Try to avoid water and make-up for the first two days after treatment.\n\nAnd Jamie Stevens, who has preened the likes of Beyonce's hair revealed how hair was shifting away from perfectly preened to texturised.\n\nHe said: 'The hair trends of 2020 are being showcased around London, Paris, Milan and New York and one of the top contenders we've seen was the 'un-dried' look.\n\n'Chanel showcased a natural, undone texture on the mid-lengths and ends using the model's own texture, whether their natural hair was curly, wavy or relatively straight.\n\n'In the salon we are starting to notice clients move away from the heavy styled haircuts, and be more inclined to want increasingly textured mid-length and ends.'\n\nHe added: 'Ralph and Russo played with heavy cheekbone length fringes with beveled smooth ends to achieve a 'done' but 'undone' finished look. Long layers were put through the mid length and ends of the hair to maintain that thickness throughout, but to add slight movement.\n\n'Ashish sent models down the runway with light, airy, wispy ends. The hair was softly braided, with embellishments added throughout the plait. We have seen a lot of clients embracing loose, feminine ends, plaiting then un-plaiting them to create undone look with enhanced movement, without having to add to much product to the hair.'\n\nActress and Chris Brown's ex Karrueche Tran is also a fan of lash lifts to open her eyes and curl her straight lashes, and is seen make-up free this year\n\nIn previous days she was often seen sporting heavier make-up and false lashes, before embracing her natural beauty\n\nLVL is a modern version of the older eyelash perm, and results are often so dramatic that you can go free of mascara and false lashes (Karrueche shows off her LVL yumilashes treatment)\n\nAnd the perm continues to make a comeback, with Jamie adding: 'Celebrities have hopped on-board with the more natural approach to styling hair. With a little help from the perm, some are opting for volume without the tight waves throughout the mid-length and ends.\n\n'Julia Roberts has recently been seen sporting a much more natural, beach wave texture, in comparison to the tight perm she used to sport. We have loved seeing her embrace her natural texture over the years from the first time we saw that mane of hair undone on Pretty Woman.'\n\n'Kate Moss has always been our girl for the best 'next day hair' texture! Her colour plays an important role in emphasizing her cut, which gives us the illusion of masses of texture throughout.'\n\nMeanwhile celebrity hair stylist Jamie Stevens, who has preened the likes of Beyonce's hair revealed how hair was shifting away from perfectly preened to texturised and even permed - as seen on Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman\n\nNicknamed the 'non-surgical facelift', the CACI Facial treatment is a favourite among celebrities including Jennifer Lopez who even purchased a home machine for a rumoured $24,000 (\u00a320k) in 2015 as she loves the effects so much", "description": "Experts have revealed how beauty lovers have begun to abandon the 'preened' look in favour of a more natural appearance, inspired by celebrities doing the same.", "authors": ["Jessica Rach For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/10/19581046-0-image-a-5_1570786612371.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
