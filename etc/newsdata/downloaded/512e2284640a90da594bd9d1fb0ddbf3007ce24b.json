Italy alone needed to play to stand any chance of staying alive.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cSure, everyone might think that Italy versus New Zealand being cancelled counts for nothing because we\u2019d have lost anyway,\u201d Parisse added. \u201cBut we deserved to be respected as a team.\n\n\u201cIt is ridiculous that there is no Plan B, because it isn\u2019t news that typhoons hit Japan. When you organise a World Cup you should have one in place.\u201d\n\nOrganisers can expect an even bigger backlash if Scotland, ranked nine in the world, are eliminated in circumstances as controversial as they are unprecedented.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nLike Italy, the Scots need to play or they are out as the standard award of two points for a \u2018draw\u2019 would put Japan through instead.\n\nNot surprisingly they were quick onto the front foot yesterday, saying they \u201cfully expected\u201d contingency plans to be put in place to enable them to settle their fate \u201con the pitch\u201d.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThey added that they would be \u201cflexible to accommodate this\u201d - by which they mean prepared to either play the following day or behind closed doors, even at a different venue.\n\nThe problem is World Rugby\u2019s insistence that all matches be treated fairly. \u201cItaly are in the same position Scotland are in,\u201d Gilpin said. \u201cWe won\u2019t treat that match any different.\"\n\nA final decision, he added, would be made on Sunday morning and the match would be neither rescheduled nor relocated.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe last typhoon to hit Tokyo claimed three lives and the following day there was transport gridlock and logistical chaos. This one is two and a half times bigger.\n\nJapan Airlines is cancelling more than 90% of its domestic flights in and out of Tokyo tomorrow. Scotland\u2019s fate is in the lap of the gods.\n\nIt is extraordinary and, frankly, farcical that no flexibility was written into the competition schedule to cope with such an eventuality.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nWorld Rugby insist all participating teams agreed to these regulations at the start so there is no legal comeback.\n\nBut do not expect that to impress the tens of thousands of supporters in Tokyo for what should have been the rugby weekend of a lifetime.", "description": "\u201cIf New Zealand needed four or five points against us it would not have been cancelled.
