Subscribe to the newsletter here .\n\nOur first-ever live event takes place in San Francisco on Tuesday, October 22nd: I\u2019ll be talking with the brilliant disinformation researcher Renee DiResta. Grab a ticket and come say hi!\n\nOver the past week or so, it has felt like the entire public conversation around tech has turned a now familiar question: what should stay up, and what should come down?\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the ongoing debate about whether Facebook should permit politicians to lie in their ads. (A tiny bit more on that below.)\n\nSecond, a pro-Trump conference screened a video of footage from the 2014 film Kingsman: The Secret Service edited to depict \u201cthe president shooting, stabbing, and attacking the news media and his opponents.\u201d YouTube restricted the video\u2019s audience but did not take it down; Twitter briefly suspended a meme maker associated with the group who made the video, over a copyright violation.\n\nThird, Twitter sought to clarify its never-enforced rules around what to do if a \u201cworld leader\u201d ever incites violence against a private individual, promotes terrorism, or violates a handful of other big rules. In some cases it will remove the tweet; in others it will put it behind a warning. That\u2019s all well and good, but policy is what you enforce \u2014 and until Twitter takes an action on one of these tweets, it\u2019s really just talk.\n\nFourth, Googlers are mad that the company removed The Revolution of Our Times, a game that \u201callows players to participate in virtual recreations of the pro-democracy demonstrations\u201d in Hong Kong. Google says it\u2019s part of a \u201clong-standing policy\u201d against creating games that take advantage of \u201csensitive events,\u201d but some employees smell a rat.\n\nFifth, TikTok \u2014 owned by the Chinese company ByteDance \u2014 announced it had hired and outside law firm and formed a committee to refine its content moderation guidelines and disclose them more fully.\n\nFinally ... oh god, how did Airbnb get mixed up in all this? Here\u2019s Tonya Riley:\n\nFair-housing advocates are accusing Airbnb and other short-term rental platforms of abusing the legal provision that grants tech companies broad immunity for content people post on its platforms. They want Congress to ensure online rental services cannot ignore \u2014 and profit off\u2014 listings that violate state and local housing laws. Most of the debate over Congress reviewing of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act has focused on social media companies: Republicans argue they\u2019re using the law to unfairly silence conservative voices and Democrats say the act should be changed to ensure social media giants take greater responsibility for disinformation and other problematic content. But this latest attack, coming just days before a House Energy and Commerce joint subcommittee hearing to examine the decades-old law, shows that changes could have consequences for other tech platforms such as online marketplaces.\n\nOK, so that one is kind of an outlier ... or at least, another conversation.\n\nAs for the rest, it strikes me that they all revolve around what platforms sometimes refer to, euphemistically, as \u201cborderline content.\u201d The basic idea is that the closer a piece of content comes to violating a platform\u2019s rules, the more that people tend to engage with it. In a world where many people want more attention than they\u2019re getting, creating borderline content is one of the few proven recipes for success.\n\nBut because it may violate a platform\u2019s rules, it requires a lot of agonizing discussions among members of the policy team and other executives. And because borderline content tends to touch on sensitive or controversial subjects, the backdrop of those discussions is often a public-relations crisis.\n\nWhat to do about it? Platforms have recently said that they hope to make borderline content less prominent in their feeds. Facebook said it would de-emphasize sensationalist stuff last November; YouTube followed suit in June. Twitter will probably have something to say about all this in 2022.\n\nBut even if that content is less prominent to most users, it will still be hosted on company servers \u2014 and will require intervention from moderators. I expect that to be doubly true next year in the United States, when we have a presidential election to look forward to.\n\nIn short, the swarm of headlines about content moderation over the past week should not be mistaken as a coincidence. What stays up \u2014 and what comes down \u2014 has never been a more salient question in people\u2019s minds. And absent any meaningful regulation, expect the tech platforms to keep fumbling their way forward, trying to appease as many users as possible.\n\nPushback\n\nThanks to everyone who wrote in with thoughts about Facebook, political ads, and lies. I\u2019ve already said a lot on this subject, but I wanted to highlight two popular ideas in your replies. One is that lying in political ads might not feel so noxious if politicians had to lie to Facebook\u2019s entire user base, rather than micro-targeted segments \u2014 where their lies might go unnoticed. One of you wrote:\n\nCould there be a partial solution for disinformation that won\u2019t abridge our free speech rights by banning micro targeting? What if instead of trying to constrain what people say in ads we force them to say it to everyone? Ban micro targeting for all political ads. Make a law that all political ads must be broadcast to all interests in the region affected. So national election ads must broadcast nationally regardless of party affiliation or interest. State election ads must broadcast state wide etc. More radically what if internet ads had to be paired with message equivalent TV, cable, and newspaper ads? I bet that would reduce the effectiveness of disinformation campaigns because it would make it harder (but not impossible) to radicalize the target audience without inflaming the opposition.\n\nAnother popular idea, and one that Facebook has considered in the past: just ban political ads altogether. This feels overly defeatist to me \u2014 and could disadvantage good candidates who don\u2019t yet have national name recognition. But given the public-relations beatings that I expect Facebook to take over its new policy in the coming year, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the company eventually did ban political ads.\n\nI also liked this point, made in an op-ed from Ellen Goodman and Karen Kornbluh in the Guardian, about the idea that not fact-checking political ads will make the company \u201cneutral\u201d politically. (Emphasis mine.)\n\nFacebook seems to concede that it \u2014 like broadcasters \u2014 exercises gatekeeping control over attention, advertising dollars, and political debate, and therefore has a fiduciary responsibility of some kind. But the platform wants to cherrypick only the permissive aspects of regulation: don\u2019t moderate for disinformation. What Facebook fails to acknowledge is that it isn\u2019t neutral. It is favoring candidates who smear their opponents and amplify baseless conspiracies. It\u2019s not just that the platform takes these ads; its algorithmic design juices their circulation by advantaging the incendiary over the informative to increase engagement.\n\nElsewhere: BuzzFeed looks at the political ads Facebook does ban, such as showing a picture of a button that you can\u2019t actually click.\n\nThe Ratio\n\nToday in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.\n\nTrending up: Here\u2019s some cautious optimism for TikTok\u2019s creation of a new committee to help shape its content moderation policies, with help from the corporate law firm K&L Gates. The company has come under fire recently for censoring content related to the Hong Kong protests while allowing the #trump2020 hashtag to thrive.\n\nTrending down: Thanks to its decision to ban a game that lets you recreate the Hong Kong protests, Google has to set its \u201cdays without a major employee protest\u201d counter back to zero.\n\nGoverning\n\n\u2b50 The 19 Democrats running for president have poured nearly $32 million into Facebook ads this year. And we can now see which voters they\u2019re targeting \u2014 and how \u2014 thanks to Facebook\u2019s public ad library. Here\u2019s Shane Goldmacher and Quoctrung Bui at The New York Times:\n\nWhen it comes to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s Facebook ads, the odds are overwhelming that people seeing them were born before 1975. For Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the opposite is true: People born in 1975 or after are more than twice as likely to see his Facebook ads than those born earlier. A gender split is clear, too: About half of Mr. Sanders\u2019s audience are men, while about two-thirds of Mr. Biden\u2019s are women. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, more or less, splits the difference between them. She has targeted a Facebook audience that more closely mirrors the projected universe of likely Democratic primary voters in 2020: more women than men (though not by as much as Mr. Biden), leaning older more than younger (but again, not by as much as Mr. Biden).\n\nShe might be spending big on Facebook ads. But Elizabeth Warren says she\u2019s no longer accepting large donations from Facebook and Google, and wants other candidates to do the same. The new policy is part of Warren\u2019s plan to get big money out of politics \u2014 something she is expected to hit on during tonight\u2019s debate.

Now, instead of case workers fighting for people\u2019s food and housing subsidies, data plays a key role in deciding who gets what. The results are generally worse for people with less money. (Ed Pilkington / The Guardian)\n\nThanks to a single liked tweet, Tencent apparently told ESPN that it will no longer broadcast Adrian Wojnarowski\u2019s Chinese basketball show, Woj in the House. Wojnarowski made the fateful mistake of liking Daryl Morey\u2019s now infamous pro-Hong Kong tweet, which China did not appreciate. (Laura Wagner / Deadspin)\n\nThe architect-turned-whistleblower of the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal, Christopher Wylie, has a new book out. It\u2019s part memoir, part expos\u00e9, and tells the story of how an Obama staffer got swept up in a dark web of data manipulation in support of candidate Trump. (Steven Levy / Wired)\n\nIndustry\n\n\u2b50Amazon sellers are using Facebook chatbots to strong-arm people into leaving good reviews. Here\u2019s how it works: sellers post Facebook ads touting \u201cfree\u201d products. When someone clicks on the ad, they\u2019re told to message the company. When they do, a bot answers telling them they\u2019ll get a full refund after buying the product, but only if they leave a 5-star review. Here\u2019s more on the scheme from Nicole Nguyen at BuzzFeed:\n\nSome Amazon sellers use a chatbot to automate the entire interaction. \u201cHello! Thanks for your interest!\u201d responds one Facebook page, named VPOW GE. \u201cDo you wanna test our FREE portable breathalyzer? It\u2019s [sic] real cost is USD 33.99, but now it is free for testing in limited time! (If yes, simply click the \u201cyes\u201d button under the picture to proceed.)\u201d Each of the page\u2019s questions were followed by clickable \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d buttons. Do you have Amazon and PayPal accounts? Yes. Can you leave a review one week after receiving the package? Yes. Confirm that your first review was published before June 1, 2019. Yes, confirmed. The page then offers a detailed set of instructions. Search for a particular keyword, look for the brand name WEIO, add the product to your Amazon Wish list, then order the product. Make sure you don\u2019t use a gift card. Half of the refund will be issued within 24 hours of receipt. The other half will arrive after you send a screenshot of your review. But be sure to wait ONE WEEK before reviewing.\n\nGoogle held its annual fall hardware event, showing off new phones, laptops, and a Wi-Fi router that doubles as a home speaker.

Now that they\u2019re in Facebook\u2019s backyard, that number could grow larger. (Salvador Rodriguez / CNBC)\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook is expanding in Seattle. The Pacific Northwest office now employs more than 5,000 people, making it the second-largest Facebook workspace outside of the Menlo Park headquarters. (Monica Nickelsburg / GeekWire)\n\nReviews of Facebook\u2019s new Portal are out. Our colleague Dan Seifert at The Verge say the device offers \u201cbetter than video calls on the smart displays from Amazon or Google.\u201d Bloomberg called the device a \u201cstellar video chat camera, weighed down by privacy concerns and better competition.\u201d This is all basically what critics said last year.\n\nKids are outsmarting Apple\u2019s parental controls meant to limit their screen time by exploiting software bugs and hacking into their parent\u2019s accounts.

But Apple has been slow to close the most glaring loopholes. (Reed Albergotti / The Washington Post)\n\nTwitter\u2019s head of product, Kayvon Beykpour, came on The Vergecast to discuss upcoming features, how the company is handling verification, and whether or not they\u2019ll ever roll out an auto-delete feature for tweets.
