I spend more time in the minivan \u2014 driving kids to sports and other activities, running to the grocery store to get yet another gallon of milk \u2014 than I do in bed. One thing, though, makes me part of a far smaller crowd: My faith. I am Catholic. An \u201call in\u201d Catholic. I go to Mass and pray the Rosary daily.\n\nI put myself in \u201cthe box\u201d \u2014 the confessional \u2014 on a weekly basis. I am completely convinced of the saving grace found in the Eucharist, and I want my family and friends \u2014 all those close to me \u2014 as well as the people I meet and those I have yet to meet to know the beauty of the Catholic Church and embrace the truths she teaches. This has become much harder over the last year.\n\nThe clergy abuse crisis, not to mention lingering questions about the role current church leaders played in enabling predator priests, remains the \u201celephant in the room.\u201d How on Earth would anyone want to be part of something so impressively dysfunctional?\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing, then, that God plays a long game. It\u2019s known as \u201csalvation history.\u201d All people should be well-versed in it. George Weigel\u2019s latest book, \u201cThe Irony of Modern Catholic History: How the Church Rediscovered Itself & Challenged the Modern World to Reform,\u201d should help. At this particularly wrought moment, his important new work taught me an important history lesson that is helping me continue my own apostolic mission.\n\nMr. Weigel, one of America\u2019s leading Catholic intellectuals and best known for his biography of Pope St. John Paul II, describes his latest book as a \u201crevisionist historiography.\u201d He rejects the received wisdom that \u201cmodernity was always the drama\u2019s protagonist and the Church was always the reactive (even reactionary) force\u201d and refocuses readers.\n\nThe arc of Mr. Weigel\u2019s historical drama instead involves \u201ca surprising renewal of Catholic identity and mission, one that reaches back two thousand years to the Church\u2019s founding generation of believers and thereby hears a call not to resist or embrace modernity, but to convert it.\u201d\n\nTrue, Mr. Weigel acknowledges, the Catholic Church initially treated the \u201cmodern world\u201d like a parent treats a precocious toddler. But that started to change sometime in the late 1800s during the papacy of Pope Leo XII. The \u201churling of anathemas\u201d ended with what Mr. Weigel dubs the \u201cLeonine Revolution.\u201d\n\nThis was \u201can important step towards a serious Catholic engagement with intellectual modernity.\u201d It ultimately set the stage for Pope John XXIII to open the ecumenical Vatican Council II \u201ccalling the Church to convert modernity rather than deplore it.\u201d\n\nPost-conciliar Catholicism \u2014 what most people consider \u201cModern Catholic History\u201d \u2014 had two key protagonists: St. John Paul the Great and his successor, Benedict XVI. Both, says Mr. Weigel, were keenly aware that \u201cconverting the modern world necessarily involved a critique of certain aspects of late modernity \u2014 a critique, this time, from within.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the church\u2019s missionary spirit was set on fire in St. John Paul\u2019s \u201cNew Evangelization.\u201d The church \u201cproposes; she imposes nothing,\u201d wrote John Paul. According to Mr. Weigel, what it has proposed \u2014 what it has evangelized \u2014 starting with John Paul II\u2019s pontificate is \u201cthe conviction that it has been given the truth about humanity and its destiny in Jesus Christ and is solemnly obliged to propose that truth to everyone.\u201d\n\nGiven the countless challenges of today \u2014 humanitarian crises culminating at the border, the discovery of the remains of thousands of little ones in the garage of a recently-deceased abortionist, children taught in schools to question and rebel against their own biological sex, trampling of conscience rights \u2014 where does the Catholic Church and its evangelizing mission stand?\n\nHas it lost all moral authority because of the recent scandals? Mr. Weigel argues that these challenges can\u2019t be addressed, and the scandals can\u2019t be redressed, by returning to the age of the papal states nor by abandoning all established teaching.\n\nSo what is the solution? For Mr. Weigel, it is simply this: \u201cOngoing purification and deep Catholic reform.\u201d More specifically, his path forward for Catholicism is \u201cthe path of missionary discipleship and public witness to the truths that make it possible to live freedom nobly.\u201d\n\nSt. Teresa of Avila had it right when she said that \u201cGod writes straight with crooked lines.\u201d George Weigel\u2019s \u201cThe Irony of Modern Catholic History\u201d traces those crooked lines in modern church history and left me more convinced than ever that, wounded as the Catholic Church may be today, it\u2019s still a place \u2014 a home, really \u2014 where we \u201cmoderns\u201d can be saved.\n\n\u2022 Andrea Picciotti-Bayer is legal adviser for The Catholic Association Foundation.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nTHE IRONY OF MODERN CATHOLIC HISTORY; HOW THE CHURCH REDISCOVERED ITSELF AND CHALLENGED THE MODERN WORLD TO REFORM\n\nBy George Weigel\n\nBasic Books, $30, 336 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
