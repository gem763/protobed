And of course it isn't really.\"\n\nMr Varadkar added that it was his job to hold the UK to commitments it had made since the 2016 referendum to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland and uphold the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nThe Irish leader's comments came after a No 10 source claimed on Tuesday that Germany was now making it \"essentially impossible\" for the UK to leave the EU with a deal.\n\nThat assessment followed a \"frank\" phone call between Boris Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, during which they discussed Brexit proposals the UK prime minister put forward last week to the EU.\n\nAfter the call, a No 10 source said Mrs Merkel had made clear a deal based on the prime minister's plans was \"overwhelmingly unlikely\" - though the BBC's Adam Fleming said there \"scepticism\" within the EU that she would have used such language.\n\nThe No 10 source also suggested Mrs Merkel told her counterpart the only way to break the deadlock was for Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union and for it to permanently accept EU single market rules on trade in goods.\n\nThis, the source said, marked a shift in Germany's approach and made a negotiated deal \"essentially impossible\".\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption Angela Merkel and Boris Johnson spoke on the phone on Tuesday morning\n\nIn response, the EU's top official, European Council President Donald Tusk, accused Mr Johnson of engaging in a \"stupid blame game\".\n\nIn a tweet to the prime minister, he added: \"At stake is the future of Europe and the UK, as well as the security and interests of our people.\n\n\"You don't want a deal, you don't want an extension, you don't want to revoke, quo vadis (where are you going)?\"\n\nEuropean Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said that if negotiations fail, \"the explanation will be found in the British camp (because) the original sin is found on the islands and not on the continent\".\n\nSpeaking to the French Les Echos newspaper, he added: \"A no-deal Brexit would lead to a collapse of the United Kingdom and a weakening of growth on the continent.\"\n\nIn his interview with RTE, Mr Varadkar was asked whether he was concerned the language around the talks was \"getting toxic\".\n\n\"I think it is, from some quarters, but you know I don't play dirty. You know, I don't think most EU leaders do either. We've been very straight up from when the referendum happened.\"\n\n'Real catastrophe'\n\nThe prime minister also hosted European Parliament president David Sassoli in Downing Street on Tuesday, but the MEP left saying \"no progress\" had been made.\n\nMr Sassoli later told the BBC's Newsnight programme: \"Angela Merkel's opinions must be taken seriously. We are all very worried because there are only a few days left.\n\n\"Because we understand that going out without an agreement leads to having a real problem, if not a real catastrophe.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics\n\nFollowing the meeting, Downing Street said there was \"little time\" left to negotiate a new legally-binding withdrawal agreement, but Mr Johnson remained committed to doing all he could.\n\n\"We need to move quickly and work together to agree a deal,\" a No 10 spokesman said.\n\n\"He [the prime minister] reiterated that if we did not reach an agreement then the UK will leave without a deal on 31 October.\"\n\nThe PM's pledge comes despite legislation passed by MPs last month, known as the Benn Act, which requires Mr Johnson to write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October - unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit.\n\nWhile negotiations are continuing in Brussels, Mr Sassoli said a deal likely to command the support of MEPs was a \"long way off\".\n\nTimeline: What's happening ahead of Brexit deadline?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nTuesday 8 October - The House of Commons was prorogued - suspended - ahead of a Queen's Speech to begin a new parliamentary session.\n\nMonday 14 October - The Commons is due to return, and the government will use the Queen's Speech to set out its legislative agenda.
