On Friday, at least 70 people were killed when a mosque in Nangarhar province was bombed.", "description": "Kabul (AFP) \u2013 European Union officials called Sunday for a ceasefire in Afghanistan, saying the breakdown in talks between the US and the Taliban", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/959668_head-eu-delegation-in-afghanistan-pierre-mayaudon-warned-an-extended-delay-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
