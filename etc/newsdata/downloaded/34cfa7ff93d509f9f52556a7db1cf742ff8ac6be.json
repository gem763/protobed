This practice was used in the lowland, coastal part of the Inca empire, but not in the mountains, researchers said.\n\nSocha believes that this may mean the girl was taken from a family living in a very distant region.\n\nTo determine the content of the mummies, which are kept frozen, scientists used X-rays.\n\nScience in Poland reports that numerous objects were found with the mummies, including gold pins, ritual cups, wooden objects and gold tubes.", "description": "Children sacrificed to the gods by the Incas could have come from different parts of the empire, according to researchers.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/child-skull.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
