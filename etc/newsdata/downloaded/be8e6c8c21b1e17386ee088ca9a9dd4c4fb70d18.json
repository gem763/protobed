Arsenal winter transfer targets 1/10 Arsenal winter transfer targets Josh Kroenke has promised Arsenal plan to be \u2018proactive\u2019 in the winter transfer market. But who could they sign? Getty 2/10 Wilfried Zaha Arsenal have not completely given up on prizing Wilfried Zaha away from Crystal Palace. He won't come cheap ... but for the right price Palace may be tempted to cash in, particularly if the 26-year-old fails to impress in the first half of the season. Getty Images 3/10 Eduardo Camavinga The 16-year-old - who enjoyed a breakthrough performance against PSG in Ligue 1 last weekend - is also a target for Manchester United, City and Tottenham. Arsenal could attempt to replicate their William Saliba deal with Saint-\u00c9tienne by signing Camavinga and then immediately loaning him back to current club, Rennes. AFP/Getty Images 4/10 Dayot Upamecano If Josh Kroenke is true to his word, and his family do back the club in the winter market, than 20-year-old defender Dayot Upamecano is surely the first player they will attempt to sign. Arsenal came close to landing him this summer, only to balk at Leipzig's \u00a355m price tag having so recently spent a club-record \u00a372m on Nicolas Pepe. Bongarts/Getty Images 5/10 Samuel Umtiti Arsenal will monitor the first half of the 25-year-old's season at Barcelona very closely. The defender's 2018/19 season was hampered by injury and Unai Emery has gone on record about how much he rates the World Cup winner. Icon Sport via Getty Images 6/10 Daniele Rugani Juventus are desperate to get rid of the defender as they scramble to balance the books ahead of this week's Italian transfer deadline. If they fail to offload Rugani he will certainly be available in the winter, and could make a good cut-price solution if Arsenal do indeed manage to sell Shkodran Mustafi this month. AFP/Getty Images 7/10 Robert Arboleda Arsenal came very close to signing the Ecuador international Robert Arboleda from S\u00e3o Paulo on transfer deadline day, instead snapping up David Luiz. But if they are short in defence in five months time, the 27-year-old would make a sensible purchase, especially considering his club were willing to sell. AFP/Getty Images 8/10 Fagner Conserva Another South American defender that Arsenal have preciously explored signing, that they could move for if necessary in January. Plays for Edu's former club Corinthians, which would help speed up any deal. AP 9/10 Everton Arsenal seriously explored signing the 23-year-old Brazil international this summer, but were deterred by his rapidly escalating price tag. But if they are backed by Josh Kroenke this winter, could they return for the Gr\u00eamio star? A move to Europe surely beckons for the electric forward, who won the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica top scorer award this summer. REUTERS 10/10 Toby Alderweireld The Spurs defender will be available to negotiate a free transfer to another club from January. Could Arsenal snap him up? It's happened once before...

Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happened and it\u2019s something that belongs to the past. The same with Mesut. We are back and we focus on our job and team. We have a very important match ahead here in Frankfurt.\n\n\u201cWell, of course, I\u2019m happy to be back. Of course, mentally this was hard, missing also training for a couple of days.\n\n\u201cI made up for it. I\u2019m back and happy to be back with the team and able to perform with them on the pitch with the team.\u201d\n\nWhile Kolasinac is set to retain his place in Unai Emery\u2019s side, the Arsenal head coach opted to leave Ozil at home, rather than take him as part of his squad for the game in Germany.\n\nEmery insists the 30-year-old needs rest despite playing just 71 minutes of football this season \u2013 having not featured until he started Sunday\u2019s 2-2 Premier League draw at Watford.\n\nHe missed the start of the campaign after the security threat and then through illness.\n\nOzil retired from international football with Germany last year amid controversy and, on what would have been his first return to play in the country, he would have no doubt been in for a hostile reception from a fervent Frankfurt crowd.\n\nBut instead Emery offered up the rather bizarre excuse that Ozil was instead being rested alongside Sokratis Papastathopoulos \u2013 who has played every minute of the opening five Premier League games of the season.\n\n\u201cWe are playing now a lot of matches and I want to use different players and also can have some rotation in the first 11 and in the 19 players in the squad for tomorrow and Sokratis and Mesut they rest this match,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI prefer after the Sunday match to rest that match and to train and to be ready for Sunday.\n\n\u201cBecause we are going to play another match on Sunday. My decision is because he played and also I\u2019m thinking tomorrow the focus and the first 11.\n\n\u201cAfter that I decided who are the players who can be the best for tomorrow and also the players not and that is Sokratis and Mesut.\n\n\u201cReally the first match he played on Sunday, he played well and was good physically \u2013 also giving us his capacity and skills and after his first minutes (of the season) it was good for us.\n\n\u201cNow he is ready to help us, not tomorrow but on Sunday \u2013 we are going to play another match and tomorrow we are thinking to do some rotation.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Sead Kolasinac insists he has put a carjacking attempt on both himself and Mesut Ozil behind him \u2013 but admits it was tough to deal with at the time.
