Even that weird callus on my baby toe is softer. Photo: Courtesy of the Vendor\n\nBy now, you\u2019ve no doubt come across a thousand endorsements preaching the gospel of the Baby Foot peel, a pair of bootees that slather your feet in a gel concoction designed to loosen dry and cracked skin. About a week later, the skin begins to fall from your feet in giant sheets, revealing the foot of a baby that was hiding underneath. It\u2019s basically a chemical peel for your feet, and I love it \u2014 but I don\u2019t use it on the regular, as it makes even the skin on the tops of my feet and my ankles peel. I\u2019m more interested in removing the calluses that build up on my feet from walking everywhere I go, and getting relief from the intense dryness that is a direct result of wearing sandals and exposing my feet to dry air all summer long.\n\nI\u2019ve bought and tried almost every foot cream, and I\u2019ve always found them a bit greasy and lacking in enough moisture to really kill the dry, ashy bits at the ends of my toes and on my heels. But then I was idly browsing at my favourite beauty shop in Little Tokyo where, lo and behold, sat this lone tube of foot cream made by the same manufacturer of the beloved Baby Foot peel kit. I snapped it up even though I couldn\u2019t read a word of the instructions (it\u2019s a Japan-only product, but of course some enterprising individual has made it available on Amazon). I figured it was foot cream, so what could go wrong?\n\nIts dry texture lets me put my shoes on immediately after applying. Photo: Courtesy of the Vendor\n\nNot only did nothing go wrong, it was better than I could have dreamed. Where most foot lotions are greasy for a good half-hour after applying (making it dangerous to walk around the house, and also a pain to put on shoes and head out the door), the Baby Foot Deep Moist Shea Butter goes on dry, but somehow moisturizes flawlessly. I\u2019m pretty sure they mean for it to be used after performing the classic Baby Foot peel, but I\u2019ve been using it as a stand-alone foot cream for a few weeks, and it blows any other foot cream I\u2019ve previously used out of the water. The dry texture is a little disconcerting on your hands, so I use a butter knife to apply it (sorry, anyone I\u2019ve invited over for dinner recently), then rub my feet together to get it into every nook and cranny. The weird callus I\u2019ve always had on my baby toe is noticeably softer, and I don\u2019t have those weird dry patches at the ends of my toes by midday anymore. It dries instantly, so I can apply it right before I throw on my shoes and race out the door, never worrying that my feet are slipping and sliding around like they do with other, greasier foot creams I\u2019ve tried. I may not be able to read a word of what the tube says \u2014 but the results don\u2019t lie.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of the Vendor Baby Foot Gift Set [Editor\u2019s Note: In the UK the Baby Foot Extra Rich Foot Cream is available for sale on Amazon in a gift set with the best-selling Baby Foot Exfoliation Foot Peel.
