Robert Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, told The Washington Times that the move is \u201cone of the biggest national security blunders I\u2019ve seen ever made.\u201d\n\nMr. Menendez, part of a bipartisan chorus on Capitol Hill that has spoken against the recent troop withdrawal, said the hearing on U.S. policy toward Iran \u201cjust goes to prove \u2026 that we have totally weakened our position as it relates to Iran and Syria.\u201d\n\nHis comments come as a Turkish-led military offensive ramps up in Northern Syria, and Russian troops move into the region to back up Syrian-led forces caught in the middle of the conflict.\n\nMr. Menendez slammed the answers provide by Brian Hook, the State Department\u2019s Iran point man, in the often heated hearing. The senator said afterward he was still not satisfied with the administration\u2019s answers.\n\nThe ranking member said Mr. Hook, who insisted that the latest developments in Syria do not make Iran more powerful and influential in the region, is \u201cvery good at creating diversions.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
