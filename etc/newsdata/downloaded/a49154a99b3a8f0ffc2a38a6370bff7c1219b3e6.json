The cut was widely expected, but the split vote has raised\n\nsome concern about predicting the future path of monetary\n\npolicy.\n\n\"Traders are disappointed by the divergence of future rate\n\ncut path and the market is unwinding expectations of a few more\n\ncuts in the months to come,\" said Margaret Yang Yan, a market\n\nanalyst at CMC Markets.\n\nLower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding\n\nnon-yielding gold, and weigh on the dollar.\n\nSpot gold inched 0.1% higher to $1,495.36 per ounce\n\nas of 0636 GMT, after falling as much as 1% on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, U.S. gold futures GCcv1 were down 0.8% at $1,503.\n\nCentral banks globally are facing increasing pressure to\n\ndole out monetary support for flagging economies as the\n\nU.S.-China trade dispute hits global economic growth.\n\n\"Gold looks vulnerable. If the Fed is right to proceed with\n\ncaution \u2013 meaning the global environment is not as dire as\n\nstimulus-hungry markets seem to envision \u2013 that implies less\n\nscope for overall easing,\" said Ilya Spivak, a senior currency\n\nstrategist at DailyFx.\n\nA close below $1,480 would set the stage for a retest of the\n\n$1,400 level initially and may then pave the way for a deeper\n\npullback, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady but\n\nsaid it would re-examine economic and price developments more\n\nthoroughly at its next policy meeting, amid growing risks to the\n\ncountry's fragile economic recovery. Spot gold is poised to break a support at $1,488 per ounce\n\nand fall to the next support at $1,446, according to Reuters\n\ntechnical analyst Wang Tao. Among other precious metals, silver dipped slightly\n\nto $17.72, and platinum XPT= and palladium XPD= were both\n\nbarely changed at $930.34 and $1,590.79 respectively.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold flat after uncertain Fed outlook", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/usd_chf_800x533_L_1411988236.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
