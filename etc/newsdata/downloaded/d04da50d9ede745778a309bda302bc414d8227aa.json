Just a few replica thatched huts and a wall of wooden stakes now stand at its summit, but this was once the capital of the Quilombo dos Palmares \u2013 a sprawling, powerful nation of Africans who escaped slavery, and their descendants who held out here in the forest for 100 years.\n\nIts population was at least 11,000 \u2013 at the time, more than that of Rio de Janeiro \u2013 across dozens of villages with elected leaders and a hybrid language and culture.\n\nPalmares allied with indigenous peoples, traded for gunpowder, launched guerrilla raids on coastal sugar plantations to free other captives, and withstood more than 20 assaults before falling to Portuguese cannons in 1695.\n\nSlaves' mass grave is grim reminder of Brazil's racist legacy Read more\n\n\u201cHundreds threw themselves to their deaths rather than surrender,\u201d said local guide Thais \u201cDandara\u201d Thaty at the historical site in Serra da Barriga. In her telling, those killed included Dandara \u2013 her adoptive namesake \u2013 captain of a band of warrior women, whose husband Zumbi is similarly shrouded in myth as a fearless Palmarian commander.\n\nSome 5 million enslaved Africans were brought across the Atlantic to Brazil between 1501 and 1888. Many escaped, forming quilombos, or free communities.\n\nThree centuries later, the remarkable saga of Palmares, the largest, is being seized on once more as a symbol of resistance against Brazil\u2019s rightwing president and the country\u2019s pervasive racism towards its black and mixed-race majority.\n\nA pair of new television and Netflix documentaries, screened in late 2018 and this June, have examined the legacy of Palmares. In March, the victorious carnival parade of Mangueira samba school highlighted Dandara among a lineup of overlooked black and indigenous heroes. Later that month, Brazil\u2019s senate voted to inscribe Dandara in the Book of Heroes in the Pantheon of the Fatherland, a soaring, modernist cenotaph in Bras\u00edlia.\n\nAngola Janga, a graphic novel charting the rise and fall of Palmares, has won a string of awards. \u201cMany people want an alternative view, to try to escape the one-sided, one-dimensional vision of our history imposed by the Portuguese and Brazilian elite,\u201d said author Marcelo D\u2019Salete, whose painstakingly researched book, including maps and timelines alongside striking monochrome illustrations, has been widely used in classrooms.\n\n\u201cQuilombos in general are very big right now,\u201d said Ana Carolina Louren\u00e7o, a sociologist and adviser to one recent documentary on Palmares. Young Afro-Brazilians have even coined a verb, she added \u2013 to quilombar \u2013 meaning to meet up to debate politics or simply celebrate black music, culture and identity.\n\nTheir forefathers were enslaved. Now, 400 years later, their children will be landowners Read more\n\nThis renewed prominence coincides with a sharp rightward turn in Brazilian politics. Jair Bolsonaro has denied that Portuguese slavers set foot in Africa, and vilified the roughly 3,000 quilombos dotted across Brazil today \u2013 poor and marginalised Afro-Brazilian communities, often descended from fugitive slaves \u2013 branding their residents \u201cnot even fit for procreation\u201d.\n\nThe president has sought to erode the landholding rights of quilombo communities in favour, critics argue, of the powerful agribusiness sector. Police killings, mainly of Afro-Brazilians, in Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo have also risen sharply in 2019 with the ex-paratrooper\u2019s encouragement.\n\nEarlier this month, footage of supermarket security guards whipping a bound and gagged black teenager for allegedly shoplifting, prompted reflections on the lasting legacy of slavery.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A painting of Zumbi dos Palmares (1927) by Ant\u00f4nio Parreiras, kept in the Museu do Ing\u00e1. Photograph: Museu do Ing\u00e1\n\nFor centuries, writers portrayed Palmarians merely \u201cas runaway blacks and outlaws who rebelled against the crown\u201d, said the Alagoas historian Geraldo de Majella.\n\nIt was only in the mid-20th century that historians began to reconstruct its story via Portuguese archives, often in Marxist terms. Meanwhile, \u201cblack militant movements took up the flag of Palmares as a movement of national liberation,\u201d De Majella explained. The largest guerrilla group during Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship (1964-85) \u2013 the Palmares Armed Revolutionary Vanguard \u2013 counted former president Dilma Rousseff among its members.\n\nFormer President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva (2003-10) simultaneously bolstered recognition of Palmares and the legal rights of present-day quilombos. November 20th \u2013 the date the Palmarian leader was slain \u2013 was officially adopted as the National Day of Zumbi and Black Consciousness in 2003.\n\nIn the same year, public schools were legally required to teach Afro-Brazilian history.\n\nBut limited archaeological evidence and the absence of Palmarian sources has encouraged freewheeling interpretations. Today, perhaps drawing on the historical presence of advanced metalworking at the site, some compare Palmares with Wakanda, the hi-tech, Afrofuturist utopia of Marvel\u2019s Black Panther.\n\nBut the inclusion of Dandara \u2013 whose first written mention occurs in a 1962 novel \u2013 in the Pantheon divided opinion. \u201cI absolutely defend creative freedom in the way people look at our history,\u201d said D\u2019Salete. \u201cBut we need to take care to differentiate between fact and fiction.\u201d\n\nFernando Holiday, an Afro-Brazilian YouTuber and conservative activist, has noted that Palmarian society had monarchical elements and also kept captives. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to disappoint leftist and black leaders, but today we\u2019re commemorating a farce,\u201d Holiday said in a video. \u201cZumbi wasn\u2019t a hero of abolition.\u201d\n\nBut Palmares and other examples of revolt and resistance, D\u2019Salete argued, \u201care important as other ways of understanding our history \u2026 so people can imagine and build another kind of society that is very different to one just based on violence and oppression\u201d.\n\nThat legacy of violence is apparent in Tiningu, a remote quilombo in Par\u00e1 state. The community has battled to receive legal recognition, threatened by the ranchers and landowners who have cut down much of the surrounding rainforest. One resident was murdered by a rival soybean farmer on the eve of Bolsonaro\u2019s election. Here, Palmares is not merely history but a source of hope.\n\n\u201cZumbi was the beginning of everything,\u201d said local teacher Joanice Mata de Oliveira, whose school is daubed with the names of African nations. \u201cHe was the one who began our fight.\u201d", "description": "Quilombo dos Palmares \u2013 founded by Africans who escaped slavery \u2013 maintained its independence for 100 years and has become a touchstone for a new generation", "authors": ["Laurence Blair"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/834f7158041677f2ce3bf447f86e68785bc47487/0_89_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ec7e09e21b3568b0110a40e3565f2ab", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
