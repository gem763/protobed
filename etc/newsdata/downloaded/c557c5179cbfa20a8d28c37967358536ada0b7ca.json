Well, it is Manchester in early September.\n\nThe particularly cold-looking security team in their bright yellow jackets are huddled together in a lower tier opposite being given their briefing.\n\nWith the covers mostly off - well, all apart from mine - a groundsman is mowing the square, while another is re-painting the worn white lines of the batting creases.\n\nLitter pickers are scouring the stands for anything missed on the previous nights searches.\n\nYes, the work at a cricket ground preparing for a big day of Ashes Test cricket gets going early - this was all happening before 8am!\n\nWatching this glorious old ground \u2018wake up\u2019 - and feeling like I was the only one there apart from the staff - was fascinating but a hearty hotel breakfast was on offer and it was time to eat.\n\nAfter a warm restaurant welcome and an espresso livener I went for a walk around the ground to soak up the atmosphere. The hotel is built into a corner of the stadium but you\u2019re allowed out to take a wander once they\u2019ve given you a wristband.\n\nBy 9am the expectant spectators are starting to arrive in their droves and the pre-game entertainment is boisterous.\n\nLarge queues are forming for artisan coffees; street performers catching the eye with cheeky acts; carpenters carving new cricket bats out of lumps of wood; and loudest of all an oompah band blasting out singalong favourites.\n\nThere\u2019s something magical about the lead-up to a big Test match and each ground has it\u2019s own personality. Lord\u2019s is prim and proper, the Oval a big knees-up, Old Trafford is fun and very, very, noisy.\n\nWith just an hour until play starts England stars Jonny Bairstow and Ben Stokes walk past me and the hordes on their way to the outdoor nets.\n\nBairstow stops for a quick chat with an official to try and arrange a last-minute car parking space for a friend. Stokes is dressed for the autumnal weather in a woolly hat.\n\nAs the Australia team coach pulls into the ground behind me I\u2019m able to peer through a fence to watch England coach Paul Collingwood give his players some throwdowns.\n\nGetting this close to the players is wonderful and very much fits in with the relaxed charm of this family-friendly arena.\n\nWith a capacity of 26,000 - many in fancy dress (the Jack Leach appreciation group was my favourite) - the concourses are bustling so I head back to my room for a mid-morning caffeine hit.\n\nI\u2019m back on my balcony as the players make their way onto the pitch with my good friend the stadium announcer whipping up the atmosphere.\n\nI\u2019ve got one of the best views in the whole ground but I still flick on my telly, which is helpfully a few seconds behind the live action so I can watch every ball twice.\n\nAn admission: after about 20 minutes and with it still being a bit chilly I got back under the duvet and positioned myself so I could watch the game live and the TV at the same time.\n\nThe next hour was one of the greatest of my life and if England had done a bit better would\u2019ve challenged for the top spot.\n\nBy lunchtime the sun was out - and I was out of bed. Sorry, mum.\n\nI got a knock on my door at 1pm and my burger and chips lunch was delivered on a silver platter, along with a draught beer from the bar. Yes, this was heaven.\n\nAt tea I turned the kettle on and had a cuppa with a scone before settling onto a large stool and watching the rest of the day from the balcony.\n\nThe last session, which saw England\u2019s position in the match deteriorate, was the perfect opportunity to strike up a chat with my next door neighbour, also sunning himself on his balcony.\n\nOnce the cricket was over I nipped down to the hotel bar which was buzzing with guests and former players bemoaning our Ashes performance.\n\nI had an early-ish night and was out of my room at the crack of dawn - so early in fact that I was out before the stadium announcer could get me a second time!\n\nBook a stay\n\nRooms at the Hilton Garden Inn Manchester Emirates Old Trafford start from \u00a370 per night.
