His frequent and open displeasure with Netanyahu damaged the prime minister\u2019s domestic standing. Netanyahu kept flying to Washington, in the belief that he could personally mend the relations. He never succeeded, and in May 1999, lost an election.\n\nNetanyahu learned a valuable lesson: How Israelis felt about the American president determined how they viewed their own leader.\n\nHe scraped back into office in 2009, but the American president, Barack Obama, held a radically different set of values from Netanyahu\u2019s, and the two men were diametrically opposed on policy. Netanyahu wanted the U.S. to ramp up economic pressure and military threats on Iran, and to put the Palestinian issue on the back burner. Obama sought to engage with the Iranian leadership while pressuring Israel to make concessions to the Palestinians.\n\nLuckily for Netanyahu, though, the Israeli electorate felt similarly uncomfortable with Obama. He had visited Israel twice before being elected president, and had professed an admiration for \u201cour strongest ally in the region and its only established democracy.\u201d But he had also made it clear that being pro-Israel didn\u2019t necessarily mean \u201cyou adopt an unwavering pro-Likud approach,\u201d and his expressions of disappointment at settlement-building had many Israelis feeling distrust and antipathy.\n\nInstead of engaging with Israelis as Clinton had, Obama left Israel off the itinerary on his first visits to the region. The Israeli leader figured that if he couldn\u2019t boast of his personal intimacy with an American leader, the next best thing would be to spin diplomatic confrontations as enmity to Israel, or even anti-Semitism. Instead of showing himself getting along with the leader of the world\u2019s only superpower and Israel\u2019s strategic ally, Netanyahu weaponized his personal confrontation with Obama.\n\nObama hates us; luckily we still have our friends in Congress to rely on, was the standard message of Netanyahu\u2019s advisers in those years. In the Netanyahu-supporting sections of the Israeli media, the president was often described as \u201cHussein Obama\u201d and as an anti-Semite, despite the fact that American military aid to Israel continued to increase during his time in office.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s domestic rivals accused him of \u201cruining\u201d the strategic relationship, but the prime minister went on to win two more elections during Obama\u2019s presidency, presenting himself as the only man who could stand up to the president. In the 2013 campaign, one of his campaign videos was titled \u201cWhen Netanyahu Speaks, the World Listens,\u201d with clips of speeches to the UN General Assembly and to a Joint Session of Congress.\n\nIn one instance in March 2015, two weeks before an election in which he was trailing in the polls, he flew to Washington to once again address Congress at the invitation of House Speaker John Boehner, to speak against Obama\u2019s key foreign-policy achievement, the Iran nuclear deal. It was an unheard-of breach of protocol\u2014no foreign leader had ever appeared in Congress to oppose the president\u2019s policies. Yet Netanyahu wasn\u2019t there to convince any American officials\u2014he was speaking to voters back home. He went on to win the election by a handy margin.", "description": "The Israeli leader has long marketed himself as an essential diplomatic asset.
