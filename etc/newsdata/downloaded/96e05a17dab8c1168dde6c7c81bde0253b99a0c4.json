Twenty-five seconds later, Giuliani changed his tune.\n\n\u201cI said I will consider it,\u201d the former mayor told ABC\u2019s DIS, -1.00% \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nNEW: Asked repeatedly if he would cooperate with House Intelligence Committee, Rudy Giuliani tells @ThisWeekABC, \"I wouldn't cooperate with Adam Schiff,\" but then says he would \"consider\" it were chair Adam Schiff removed. https://t.co/S0bTTE1vKj pic.twitter.com/gszI6zeRUV \u2014 This Week (@ThisWeekABC) September 29, 2019\n\nFor the entirety of the interview, Stephanopoulos was trying to pin Giuliani down on whether he might testify before the committee, which is leading the portion of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry .\n\nIt comes on the heels of allegations made by a whistleblower that said Trump was trying to pressure the Ukrainian president to work with Giuliani to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\n\nWhen first asked if Giuliani would cooperate with the Democrat-led House committee, he answered, \u201cThat is a question that has a lot of, lot of implications.\u201d\n\n\u201cBelieve it or not, I\u2019m an attorney,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cEverything I did was to defend my client. I am proud of what I did. And I am proud of having uncovered what will turn out to be a massive pay-for-play scheme not unlike the Clinton Foundation.\u201d\n\nWhen asked again about working with the House Intelligence Committee, Giuliani suggested the answer was no.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t cooperate with Adam Schiff,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think Adam Schiff should be removed. If they remove Adam Schiff, if they put a neutral person in who hasn\u2019t prejudged the case, if they put a Democrat in who hasn\u2019t expressed an opinion yet,\u201d Giuliani went on.\n\nNews Pulse: Whistleblower to testify before Schiff committee\n\nWhen Stephanopoulos reiterated the point he thought Giuliani had just made, the former US attorney corrected him.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I said I will consider it,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cI said I will consider it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to abide by my client, I\u2019m a lawyer, it\u2019s his privilege not mine,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf he decides he wants me to testify, of course, I\u2019ll testify, even though I think Adam Schiff is an illegitimate chairman. He has already prejudged the case.\u201d\n\nSchiff hinted last Sunday that he had grown more supportive of an impeachment effort after details of the whistleblower report were reported in the press.\n\nThe report has since been made public by the White House.\n\nOn Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the Democrats would continue existing investigations into Trump under the umbrella of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nSchiff has become the face of the effort so far.\n\n\u201cIf you want fairness here you\u2019ve got to put somebody in charge of that committee who has an open mind, not somebody who wants to hang the president, who said I have evidence of Russian collusion,\u201d Giuliani added. \u201cAdam, where\u2019s the evidence?\u201d\n\nAs he concluded the interview, Giuliani suggested Stephanopoulos \u2014 who worked in the Clinton White House \u2014 would give Schiff, who was appearing on the program directly after him, an easier time.\n\nNews Pulse: Trump aide Stephen Miller says whistleblower \u2018does not deserve [that] honorific\u2019\n\n\u201cAre you going to interrupt him as much as you interrupted me?\u201d Giuliani asked, as Stephanopoulos tried to go to a commercial break. \u201cLet\u2019s see how the interview goes: \u2018Hi, Adam, nice to see you!\u2019 \u201d Giuliani said.\n\nThis report previously appeared at NYPost.com.", "description": "During a whirlwind interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said he wouldn\u2019t cooperate with House...", "authors": ["Nikki Schwab"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GI433_giulia_ZG_20180502231027.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
