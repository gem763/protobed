David Bradford, one of the study\u2019s authors, told MarketWatch that some research has linked opioid abuse and deaths to economic and social problems, like so-called \u201cdeaths of despair.\u201d But \u201canother factor that hasn\u2019t received as much attention as it should is combat exposure,\u201d Bradford said.\n\n(Other theories on the epidemic note that low-income Americans may not be able to afford alternative care, and allege that some drug companies put profits over public health.)\n\nPrevious research \u2014 and some government action \u2014 has addressed the links between opioids and veterans who return with physical and psychological wounds. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs determined in 2015 there was a 55% increase in opioid use disorder for soldiers returning from tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. Other research determined veterans\u2019 opioid abuse rate was seven times higher than civilian rates.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Study of 263,000 active-service U.S. Army soldiers: Only 30% have \u2018ideal\u2019 blood pressure\n\nVeterans might be \u201cat ground zero of this crisis,\u201dresearchers wrote, but the epidemic isn\u2019t confined to returning soldiers.\n\nThere were almost 9,500 opioid-related deaths in 2001, one study found. By 2016, there were 42,245 deaths opioid related to the painkillers, a 345% increase.\n\nThe Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs have been researching ways soldiers can cope with chronic pain without relying on pharmaceuticals. In 2017, the two departments, along with the Department of Health and Human Services, announced they would spend a combined $81 million for research into the effectiveness of activities like yoga, Tai Chi and mindful meditation.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs and the Defense Department could not be immediately reached for comment.", "description": "Military veterans are at the epidemic\u2019s forefront, a new study says.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR474_soldie_ZG_20190917155041.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
