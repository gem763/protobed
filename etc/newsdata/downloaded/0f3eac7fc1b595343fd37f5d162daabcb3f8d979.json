The alleged comments in question were made in a workshop setting, so there was no question of whether it was a political dispute.\n\nNel alleged in his affidavit that in a workshop on February 2, 2018, Kohler Barnard made comments that were \"xenophobic, racist and sexist in nature\".\n\nIn a paraphrased explanation of the comments, he alleged that she said:\n\n- \"Farm murders have decreased since the removal of then president Robert Mugabe, as Zimbabweans have returned home\";\n\n- \"Women have themselves to blame and are 'stupid for being scammed as they enter into relationships with Nigerian men who sleep with them and solicit money under false pretences; and\";\n\n- \"Black children are killing 'whiteys' with stones thrown at vehicles from bridges, 'never mind the fact that coloured or Indian people are also being killed'; also, the respondent (Kohler Barnard) questioned why these 'kids' were not in school.\"\n\nHe submitted in the affidavit: \"It is my contention that the utterances listed above amount to unfair discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity, gender and race, and betrayed a bigoted attitude towards Zimbabweans, women and people of colour.\"\n\n'Utterances are not supported by fact'\n\nHe continued that in her position, Kohler Barnard would know that the utterances \"are not supported by fact\".\n\nDA MP Zakhele Mbhele was also present at the hour-long workshop along with Grant Caswell, Mondli Zondo, Christa Badenhorst and Kabelo Mohlohlo, his affidavit read.\n\nThey also caused hurt and offence to himself and in conversation with his colleagues, to them too. He said that associating Zimbabweans with murder is particularly hurtful and offensive to him as his children have a Zimbabwean mother and some of their colleagues were born in Zimbabwe.\n\nHe said Kohler Barnard had a responsibility to uphold the values of human dignity as set out in the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act.\n\nThe point of the proceedings was to decide whether it was an Equality Court matter, so there were no submissions over the merits of the complaint.\n\nKohler Barnard's lawyer advocate Michael Tsele fought hard over the almost two-hour directions hearing to defend Kohler Barnard's lack of an affidavit, and submitted that mediation would be a better option.\n\nComments taken out of context\n\nHe said he was \"perfunctorily\" briefed fresh, but did know that Kohler Barnard disputed making the comments Nel accuses her of, and said they were taken out of context.\n\n\"The respondent says the comments were taken out of context and in some instances distorted. She would be open to a suitable mediator agreed upon by all parties or an institution who is capable [of dealing with matters of this sort].\n\nBut Thulare was not satisfied.\n\n\"You remember that if Mr Nel may have misunderstood her, you may have misunderstood her,\" said Thulare.\n\nThulare ruled that the matter be heard as an Equality Court matter.\n\nThere was another hiccup when May 9 was proposed as the return date.\n\nNel, representing himself, pointed out that that would be the day after the May 8 provincial and national elections and it was not just Kohler Barnard who had a reputation to protect, but also himself.\n\nThulare also wanted to know why Kohler Barnard should get so much time to prepare an affidavit and witness statements.\n\nThe return date was eventually set at May 3 when a trial date is expected to be set.\n\nGuilty of breaching DA's social media policy\n\nIt is not the first time Kohler Barnard is accused of making inappropriate comments.\n\nKohler Barnard returned to her police and justice portfolio, known as \"shadow minister of police\" within the party, in August 2017.\n\nThat was after being demoted to \"deputy shadow minister of public works\" in 2015 after sharing a post on social media which praised apartheid-era prime minister, PW Botha.\n\nShe said she had shared it without reading it fully.\n\n\"Please come back PW Botha - you were far more honest than any of these [ANC] rogues, and you provided a far better service to the public,\" the post read.\n\nAt a DA disciplinary hearing, she pleaded guilty to breaching the party's social media policy, misconduct and bringing the party into disrepute.\n\nIn December 2015, Kohler Barnard\u2019s expulsion from the DA was lifted following an appeal.\n\nThe party had her attend a presentation on the safe use of social media, pay a R20 000 fine and resign from all elected positions in the party, except that of MP.\n\nComment from Kohler Barnard was not immediately available.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "DA MP Dianne Kohler Barnard  is to face an Equality Court hearing over alleged racist and discriminatory complaints made at a staff workshop, Cape Town's chief magistrate has ruled.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3463/d5ebb573ca2d4e88aa1b0d1c2154c971.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-28"}
