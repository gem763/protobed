Some invoices are as much as three years old, dating back to rallies Mr Trump hosted before his election in 2016.\n\nAn arena in Minneapolis, Minnesota claimed the president was still on the hook for $530k in security and other costs. Facing a threat of litigation from Mr Trump\u2019s campaign, the arena withdrew its request, but the city maintains that the cost of services provided for campaign events should come from the president\u2019s campaign chest and not city coffers.\n\nMinneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said that the city\u2019s taxpayers \u201cshould not have to bear the brunt of operating costs resulting from the president\u2019s visit\u201d.\n\nIn June, The Centre for Public Integrity reported Mr Trump owed an additional $840k from invoices across the US. CNN later found that six of those cities are still waiting for checks.\n\nThough it\u2019s difficult to determine who actually is liable for the cost of local police services for campaign rallies, they\u2019re a requirement for the Secret Service details accompanying them.\n\nIn its report, The Centre for Public Integrity argued that the campaign could be flouting federal campaign finance laws for failing to address it debts owed to local governments. Law states that political committees \u201cshall report a disputed debt ... if the creditor has provided something of value to the political committee\u201d. In its mandatory reports to the Federal Election Commission, Mr Trump\u2019s campaign did not disclose actual debts or \u201cdisputed debts\u201d to cities or their police departments.", "description": "President Donald Trump is being asked to cough up a $211,175.95 bill for relying on \u201ccritical and limited\u201d city police and employees in Albuquerque, New Mexico following a September rally that cost the city 1,500 hours in overtime pay.", "authors": ["Alex Woodward"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/17/10/trump-rally-new-mexico.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
