He was extradited to California on August 15.\n\nA housekeeper found Crane, 57, dead in his garage in his Studio City townhouse on July 5, 1985. He was naked and had been wrapped in bedsheets. He had been beaten with a large ceramic statue and strangled with a telephone cord, according to court documents.\n\nHiatt is seen in a court appearance in North Carolina this summer. He was originally arrested in May and was extradited to Los Angeles County on August 15\n\nA housekeeper found Crane (left foreground and right) dead in his garage in his Studio City townhouse on July 5, 1985. He was naked and wrapped in bedsheets\n\nCrane directed dozens of episodes of such hit 1970s and '80s TV shows as The Incredible Hulk, Hawaii 5-O and The Six Million Dollar Man. He also produced the show The Magician and was associate producer for Mannix and Mission: Impossible.\n\nHe was also a world-class bridge champion.\n\nThere has been no word on a possible motive for the killing, but Hiatt told news cameras after his arrest that he was 'big into drugs' at the time of the murder, and 'anything's possible back then.'\n\nPolice say that Hiatt confessed to the murder, though Hiatt's public statements have been less definitive.\n\nVideo from WSOC-TV showed Hiatt being arrested. Hiatt, with long white hair and beard, held his handcuffed hands in front of him as he was taken to a car.\n\nHiatt told the station that he didn't remember Crane's name until it was told to him and had no memory of what occurred so long ago except for 'bits and pieces that were brought back to me just by suggestion.'\n\n'I just don't want to remember the past,' he said, adding later: 'It's a different life today.'\n\nSuspect Edwin Hiatt, 52, after his arrest in May in Burke County, North Carolina\n\nAuthorities say the FBI arrested Hiatt after DNA evidence linked him to the 1985 death of Barry Crane in Los Angeles\n\nHiatt is charged with bludgeoning and strangling to death Hollywood TV director Barry Crane; (pictured in 1973) more than three decades ago\n\nHiatt is a born again Christian who was active in church life in North Carolina prior to his arrest, and his friends have come to his defense in interviews with the press.\n\n'I'd say that if he did have something to do with it, it was still a defense,' friend Ernest 'Sonny' Ward told the Morganton News Herald in August.\n\n'He has an innocence to him,' Ward said. 'Not that he's guilty, you know? Self-defense.'\n\n'It was self-defense,' said another friend, Dee Hall. 'We're not at liberty to say what happened. We don't know exactly, just what little bit Ed has said to us in the past. But that's his place, that's his story to tell, not ours.'\n\nWard, Hall and others appeared in North Carolina court to support Hiatt through his lengthy extradition process, which at one point necessitated a governor's warrant to prevent Hiatt's release as the process dragged out.\n\nFor decades, Crane's death went unsolved until last year, when police say they got a hit on Hiatt from a partial fingerprint recovered from Crane's car, which was stolen in the murder.\n\nTo build their case against Hiatt, LAPD and FBI investigators surveilled him and secretly collected discarded cigarette butts and a coffee cup in November 2018 from the parking lot of the North Carolina auto repair shop where Hiatt worked.\n\nPolice matched DNA from those items to cigarette butts found in Crane's stolen car, which was discovered shortly after his death on a mountain road, investigators said.\n\nOn March 8, homicide detectives went to North Carolina to interview Hiatt.\n\n'During the interview, Hiatt admitted to killing Barry Crane,' an LAPD statement said.\n\nFBI investigators then obtained discarded cigarette butts and a coffee cup in November 2018 from the parking lot of the auto repair shop in Burke County where Hiatt worked\n\nHis 2nd Chance Engine Repair colleague said Hiatt (left) has been a better father than his own dad in the short time he's know him\n\nHiatt started volunteering at The Oaks Sweeten Creek assisted living facility in 2014. Hiatt also appears to enjoy created artworks\n\nHiatt is was a groundsman at Turning Leaf Tree Service from 2013 until he had an accident and began volunteering at The Oaks Sweeten Creek assisted living facility in 2014. He also appears to enjoy created artworks.\n\nCo-workers told the News Herald that Hiatt was a generous and peaceful man.\n\n'He wouldn't hurt a flea,' Dee Hall said.\n\n'This is something that supposedly happened 30 years ago, the man's changed,' Hall said. 'Christ has come in and he's become a new creature. If God's forgiven you, you're forgiven. That's it.'\n\nHis 2nd Chance Engine Repair colleague said he's been a better father than his own dad in the short time he's know him: 'We were working in here last week, and he had only known me for two or three days. He made like $40 that day, we didn't get much done.\n\n'But still yet, just him making $40, he gave me half of it right off the bat just to make sure I had cigarette money and gas money and stuff like that..'\n\nIn 1985 Hiatt was caught with a stolen car in Utah. The vehicle was not Crane's. In 1997 he was caught up in a domestic violence case where his now-ex-wife claimed he choked and beat her until she vomited then threatened to burn the house down.", "description": "Edwin Jerry Hiatt, 53, was arraigned on Tuesday in Los Angles\u00a0one count of murder with a special allegation that he used a deadly weapon to kill director Barry Crane in 1985.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/00/19466658-0-image-a-11_1570576585041.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
