It\u2019s not quite the response I was anticipating, given that he has been photographing the country for 40 years now and his best shots are about to go on show at the National Museum in Cardiff. But then Parr has spent five decades confounding and wrong-footing \u2013 if not actually deflating \u2013 people\u2019s expectations of his work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a coincidence they\u2019re all taken in Wales,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019ve gone out to capture Wales. They\u2019re just pictures that happen to have been taken in Wales, and therefore by default are a portrait or interpretation of the country. There are places that aren\u2019t represented, but that\u2019s the point really. These are the pictures I\u2019ve come across.\u201d\n\nThis may be disingenuous. I hail from south Wales, where most of the photographs in the exhibition were taken, and could quickly identify with the bank holidays at the beach under leaden skies, the delight of middle-aged women on nights out \u2013 you can almost hear them singing Delilah. These are people just getting by, having a brief epiphany in the sun at Llandudno, or embarking on an evening of wild abandon at a working men\u2019s club in Llantrisant. Then there\u2019s what can only be described as the celebration of awful food: beans, milkshakes, extravagantly coloured cupcakes, faggots and mushy peas drowning in gravy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018We\u2019re being fed lies\u2019 \u2026 grapefruit and Constable in Abergavenny, 2008. Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos/Rocket Gallery\n\nWhy the obsession with food? \u201cIf you go into a posh restaurant now, everyone is photographing food,\u201d says Parr. \u201cI was on the case early. Food says a lot about who we are and what we\u2019re doing. If you go to a supermarket and look at the food on the packet and then open it up, it never looks the same. We\u2019re being fed these lies constantly about how the world is represented. It\u2019s a great opportunity to subvert that.\u201d\n\nParr is sitting at a low table piled high with photographs when I arrive at his office in Bristol. These are pictures of recent protests (pro-Brexit, anti-Brexit, climate crisis) that might eventually find their way into a book: Parr on Protest, perhaps. The photographer has produced more than 100 books in his 45-year career \u2013 extended photo-essays exploring such subjects as tourism, consumerism and class. As for Wales, it\u2019s not far from Bristol \u2013 and anyway, Parr has a holiday flat overlooking his beloved beach at Tenby, on the country\u2019s south coast.\n\nThe first photograph in the show is a black-and-white image from 1975 of a bemused middle-aged couple at the summit of Snowdon, evidently wondering what they should do now. As ever with Parr\u2019s work, there is a twist, a trace of sardonic humour: the woman appears to have brought several handbags on the ascent. There are also a few photographs of Tower Colliery near Aberdare, the oldest continuously working deep mine in the UK until its closure in 2008.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Is this all there is?\u2019 \u2026 handbags at the top of Snowdon, 1975. Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos\n\nThe shots of this vanished world come as a surprise after the cakes and beaches, especially the picture of miners marching in protest at closures, the show\u2019s sole explicitly political note. But even in his set of mining photographs, Parr catches the sheer oddness of life, photographing one blackened miner drinking a cup of tea in an austere room brightened only by a Christmas tree sitting on the table. Another case of getting by in challenging circumstances.\n\nParr\u2019s photographs are often witty. In another shot, a butcher\u2019s arm echoes the strings of sausages in his shop window. \u201cI like humour,\u201d says Parr. \u201cWe learn a lot by listening to standup comics. The vulnerability they often express has an overlap with the vulnerability I\u2019m looking for in my own work. The world is funny, let\u2019s face it, and people are funny.\u201d\n\nParr, who is 67 and was born in Epsom, Surrey, says his Welsh photographs should be seen in the context of a lifelong project to document the whole of Britain, an endeavour now reaching an even larger audience thanks to the \u201cidents\u201d he has done for BBC One. As they draw breath between programmes, viewers are treated to Parr\u2019s clips of like-minded people coming together: potholers, bhangra dancers, kayakers, lifeguards, junior footballers, female boxers, wheelchair-using rugby players, bog snorkellers.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sardonic humour \u2026 Tower \ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcColliery, Glamorgan, 1993. Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos/Rocket Gallery\n\n\u201cMy affection for Wales is very high,\u201d says Parr. \u201cBut my preoccupation is with the United Kingdom. I recently did a book on Scotland.\u201d There will be a show there, too, in Aberdeen. \u201cIt\u2019s a phase I\u2019m going through. Next year I\u2019ll be doing an Irish book because I\u2019ve spent a lot of time there as well.\u201d\n\nHis Bristol HQ, The Martin Parr Foundation, opened in 2017 and houses not only his own archive of more than one million images but the work of other postwar British documentary photographers. The foundation puts on shows, organises talks and publishes books. Its latest volume is a tribute to Tony Ray-Jones, a pioneering British photographer who died in 1972 at the age of 30.\n\nRay-Jones also loved beaches and captured their quirky Britishness in arresting black and white. Parr, who regards the beach as a great democratic space where people truly express themselves, took his stylistic cue from Ray-Jones, then led the move to saturated colour photography with his breakthrough exhibition and book The Last Resort in 1986. He says he was applying the techniques used in advertising to documentary photography \u2013 and has now not merely become a photographic institution but opened one, employing 10 hyper-energetic young people at his foundation.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Echoes of Merseyside \u2026 Barry Island, Wales, 1996. Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos\n\nThe Last Resort, which photographed daytrippers to New Brighton on Merseyside, was criticised by some as patronising. These critics might feel the same way about Parr\u2019s photographs of the Welsh working class. A shot in the Cardiff show, of a boy being fed beans and chips, seems to echo his famous photograph of two children in New Brighton standing at a kerb luxuriating in their gooey ice creams. \u201cI\u2019m pretty democratic when it comes to classes,\u201d is all he will say in response to such criticism. \u201cI\u2019ve done them all \u2013 though it\u2019s more difficult to identify a posher class in Wales.\u201d\n\nWhen Parr applied to be a full member of the celebrated Magnum photo agency in 1994, his application was opposed by photojournalist Philip Jones Griffiths, famous for his pictures of the Vietnam war. Jones Griffiths believed in photography as an agent of social change. Parr, he argued, \u201chas always shunned the values that Magnum was built on. Not for him any of our concerned \u2018finger on the pulse of society\u2019 humanistic photography.\u201d\n\nJones Griffiths believed Parr\u2019s membership would be a repudiation of everything Magnum stood for. But in the end, Parr wasn\u2019t just elected \u2013 he went on to serve as president of the agency for four years, suggesting he won not just the battle but the war. It shows Parr\u2019s steeliness that he rode out both that attack and another from the great French photographer (and Magnum co-founder) Henri Cartier-Bresson, who claimed Parr\u2019s work was \u201cfrom another planet\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest One of his favourites \u2026 ice-cream van at Tenby beach, 2018. Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos/Rocket Gallery\n\n\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t got into Magnum,\u201d says Parr, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t have been the end of the world because I was relatively established. But I liked the challenge, and I liked the concept of Magnum. Since then, many other photographers have come in and the agenda has somewhat loosened.\u201d\n\nParr talks me through his picture of a queue for an ice-cream van on the beach at Tenby, a shot he is particularly pleased with. His beach pictures are full of the sort of mini-dramas his idol Ray-Jones specialised in. The same could be said of that couple surveying Snowdon. You really do want to know what conversation they\u2019re having: \u201cIs this all there is?\u201d\n\n\u201cI just show things as I find them,\u201d says Parr innocently. \u201cIt\u2019s not a journalistic statement. It\u2019s a personal statement. You could argue it\u2019s fiction based on reality \u2013 my interpretation of the world.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Martin Parr in Wales is at National Museum Cardiff, 26 October to 4 May.\n\n\n\n", "description": "His ability to turn photos into odd mini-dramas has found its perfect subject: Wales.
