(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nEver since Richard Nixon coined the term \u201csilent majority\u201d in 1969, commentators have been obsessed with debating this voting bloc\u2019s contours and character.\n\nThough generally associated with conservatives and Republicans, some Democrats, like Cheri Bustos, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairwoman who guided 2018 candidates in 12 heartland states, have tried to wrest the label away from the right. \u201cIf you look throughout the heartland,\u201d Bustos claimed, \u201cthere\u2019s a Silent Majority who just wants normalcy, just wants to see that people are going to go out to Washington and fight for them in a civil way and get something done.\u201d\n\nBut Bustos is wrong. The silent majority concept is inextricably intertwined with backlash politics of the sort promoted by Trump. The concept was perhaps best explained by historian Rick Perlstein, who described the silent majority not in terms of demographics but emotion: \u201ca feeling of dispossession,\u201d especially in times of great change. And while Democratic presidential candidates seem to think that hammering away at Trump\u2019s incivility will damage his popularity in \u201cmiddle America,\u201d these attacks actually only bolster his appeal to the silent majority. This voting bloc sees such criticism as an attempt to silence Trump, and by proxy, them.\n\nThat sense of embattled disaffection has been a defining feature of the silent majority from the beginning. The goal of reaching the \u201cgreat silent majority\u201d animated Nixon\u2019s efforts during the 1970 midterm campaign, as he attempted to lure disaffected white Democrats into the Republican fold. Just days before the election, Nixon thrilled an Arizona crowd with his trademark tough talk, fuming against \u201cthe haters\u201d and asserting, \u201cThe time has come for the great silent majority of Americans of all ages, of every political persuasion, to stand up and be counted against appeasement of the rock throwers and the obscenity shouters in America.\u201d\n\nBut this hard-line rhetoric, and a lurch to the right on social and racial issues that accompanied it, fell short. Rather than gain seats in Congress, Nixon watched several coveted seats fall to the Democrats. The losses punctured his claim that a new majority had just been waiting for a politician to speak to them. In retrospect, even Nixon admitted the approach went \u201ctoo far overboard.\u201d In the weeks following the election, Nixon\u2019s staff scrambled to explain the poor showing and the shortcomings of his \u201claw and order\u201d appeal to America.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t mean abandoning the concept of a silent majority. Instead, a battle ensued within the Nixon administration over the best way to capitalize on the idea. Aide Kevin Phillips continued to see political opportunity in an appeal to those voters who were revolting against the excesses and the rights movements of the 1960s. \u201cYoung policemen, truck drivers, and steelworkers,\u201d who Nixon sought to include in his constituency along with Sun Belt suburban voters, \u201clean toward a kind of hippie stomping, anti-intellectual, social \u2018conservatism\u2019 in the [Gov.] George Wallace vein,\u201d Phillips argued.\n\nCapturing this population would enable Nixon to carve out a new political majority. From Phillips\u2019s perspective, the road map to doing so involved attacking young leftists but also opposing civil rights legislation and channeling racist resentments to win working-class white voters from the Democratic Party. As he claimed in his influential book, \u201cThe Emerging Republican Majority,\u201d \u201cFrom now on, the Republicans are never going to get more than 10 to 20 percent of the Negro vote and they don\u2019t need any more than that.\u201d Phillips\u2019s perspective garnered important conservative adherents within the White House such as Tom Huston and Pat Buchanan.\n\nNot all of Nixon\u2019s aides, however, agreed with Phillips\u2019s assessment. A revealing memo from future senator Daniel P. Moynihan laid out the countervailing arguments made in the White House. Moynihan, a Democrat in a Republican administration, understood the potential of backlash politics and encouraged Nixon\u2019s attacks on countercultural permissiveness. He even agreed with Phillips that the \u201cpolitics of the radical left \u2026 are a form of upper-class aggression.\u201d\n\nBut while Moynihan embraced a populist vision of a bitter silent majority, he maintained that reaching these voters required finesse and demanded a positive intellectual defense of their traditions. To Moynihan, \u201cThe silent majority is silent because it has nothing to say.\u201d An \u201cadversary culture which dominates almost all channels of information transfer and opinion formation\u201d left this majority with no response to the challenges to capitalism and traditional values raised by the \u201cauthoritarian Left.\u201d Though Nixon might have had \u201cmore troops,\u201d Moynihan conceded that \u201cthe other side has more firepower. Infinitely more.\u201d\n\nLike Phillips, Moynihan thought better communication was key to capturing the silent majority. Instead of the bellicose, \u201chippie stomping\u201d conservatism advocated by Phillips, however, he wanted to see effective, outspoken communicators advocating for \u201cmoderation, decency, common sense, restrained ambition, attainable goals, comprehensible policies.\u201d Put bluntly, Moynihan argued that \u201cthe administration needs more class among its supporters.\u201d Nonetheless, even Moynihan\u2019s more measured conception had real limits, especially when it came to race: he supported Nixon\u2019s targeting of \u201cblack militants\u201d and \u201cracial extremists.\u201d\n\nTo some extent, Nixon heeded Moynihan\u2019s warning, softening his rhetoric and creating a robust effort to reach out to black voters and an \u201cOpen Door\u201d youth initiative that included a White House Youth Conference, a surprisingly widespread Young Voters for the President organization and policy efforts on issues important to young voters, such as the environment and the draft.\n\nBut Nixon still indulged in plenty of Phillips-style bromides. The president branded Democrats as unpatriotic, and his reelection campaign assailed his 1972 opponent George McGovern as the extremist candidate of \u201cacid, amnesty and abortion.\u201d Nixon ordered the production of a hard-hitting advertisement about McGovern\u2019s soft stance on draft dodgers, believing that this sort of tough \u201claw and order\u201d rhetoric only threatened to \u201close the Jewish young, that\u2019s about all.\u201d\n\nWhile Nixon\u2019s rhetoric was less over the top than Phillips might have favored, he still saw voters\u2019 resentment toward the pervasive, stifling culture driven by \u201cthe Left\u201d as a key strategy to reach the silent majority. His tactics revealed that the commonalities between Moynihan and Phillips were more important than their differences. They both understood the silent majority as something inherently tied to white-working-class angst that elites were perpetuating new norms that constrained their ability to defend American values out of fear of being branded racist, sexist or otherwise bigoted.\n\nIf anything, this resentment has only grown stronger over the last half-century, which is why Trump\u2019s appeals to his silent majority sounds a lot more like the pugilistic, anti-intellectual stuff Phillips dreamed of than Moynihan\u2019s moderation or common sense.\n\nThe idea of the silent majority is something that conservative voters, who feel their values are under siege, have long been able to rally around. Most importantly, perhaps, these voters feel muzzled. As one Trump supporter complained, \u201cThe reason we\u2019re silent is because we\u2019re not allowed to talk.\u201d He continued, \u201cMy favorite thing about Trump is that he wants to get rid of political correctness.\u201d\n\nThis sense of marginalization is also why the left can\u2019t co-opt the idea of a silent majority. After a Trump rally in July included supporters chanting \u201csend her back,\u201d referring to Rep. Ilhan Omar, CNN commentator Van Jones challenged the vision of a backlash-driven silent majority, claiming, \u201cI think there\u2019s a silent majority of people who have been getting increasingly uncomfortable with what Trump is up to.\u201d\n\nBut Jones, Bustos and other Democrats looking to borrow the phrase to win over this crucial voting bloc have the same misconception as Moynihan: that the silent majority wants civility and sobriety. They overlook the fundamental role race, resentment and alienation played in why the silent majority concept stuck. While these voters are neither silent nor a majority, they feel as though they have been dictated to by a disproportionately powerful minority \u2014 and they want a champion willing to fight back against that minority, something Trump does with relish.", "description": "Donald Trump is exactly the kind of champion the silent majority wants.", "authors": ["Seth Blumenthal", "Seth Blumenthal Is A Historian", "Senior Lecturer In Boston University S College Of Arts", "Sciences", "Recently Published", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7GlIr-RZBntFinnqGaaTuMhcDwI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YGXUZGWZCUI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
