I\u2019ve called 75 times! What is @CNN hiding? WE NEED YOUR HELP, DEMAND ANSWERS! #ExposeCNN #MeTooCNN pic.twitter.com/5bTZotOdie \u2014 James O\u2019Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) October 24, 2019\n\n\u2014\n\nLook at that\u2026 All of a sudden the self-proclaimed Captain of Chivalry, the Male Feminist of all Male Feminists, Mr. Squeaky Clean, Mr. Ethics and Virtue, Mr. Fox News Is a Cesspool of Rape\u2026 All of a sudden when he has skin in the game, when #BelieveAllWomen becomes inconvenient to his status and income, he runs away like a sleazy politician, like a Company Man, like just another white cis-gendered member of the CNN\u2019s Patriarchy.\n\nThe background is that James O\u2019Keefe\u2019s Project Veritas has video of Rick Saleeby, a senior producer of Tapper\u2019s basement-rated program, claiming he knows all about \u2014 and even witnessed \u2014 CNN supervising producer Steve Brusk\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct:\n\n\u201cSo, like, there is this girl that was twenty-one. She\u2019s actually a good friend of mine. She had just gotten hired after being an intern\u2026 And she was getting\u2026 There was a going-away party for a co-worker. We were all having a really good time\u2026 She was very well-liked. We were getting drunk. He started, like, staying close to her\u2026 Arm around her,\u201d Saleeby recalled. \u201cShe had a skirt on. I could see the hand. I, like, grab her. It looked like I was being the assaulter because I grabbed her so aggressive\u2026 To keep her from him. Like, go around her and go, \u2018Come over here\u2019 and looked at him because I could flatten him,\u201d the CNN producer added. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it because then I would be the one who got fired\u2026 He would have absolutely been like, \u2018get in a cab with me later.\u2019\u201d \u201cHe had already been accused of the things prior, which I found out later,\u201d he added.\n\nHey, tell me, who said this\u2026?\n\n\u201cThose who express outrage at one sexual harasser and not another because of the first harasser\u2019s political views, that is morally bankrupt. \u201d\n\nJake Tapper said that!\n\nYep that was Jake Tapper a mere two years ago, publicly lecturing others about virtue and ethics and moral courage and sexual harassment and stuff\u2026\n\nAnd yet, today, Mr. Moral Courage has nothing to say about an alleged predator in his own midst? Aside from, \u201ctalk to our PR department,\u201d the same people who are still giving O\u2019Keefe the runaround after 75 calls.\n\nIs it just me, or is Jake Tapper\u2026 Oh, how shall I put it\u2026 expressing \u201coutrage at one sexual harasser and not another because of the first harasser\u2019s political views?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m just asking questions.\n\nI\u2019m just raising awareness.\n\nOr is the problem, perhaps, elsewhere\u2026?\n\nSomething else we learned from Project Veritas is that CNN chief Jeff Zucker sometimes feels the need to tell Tapper what to say, to figuratively turn Tapper into a his own personal ventriloquist dummy so all the words come out correctly.\n\nSo maybe Tapper just isn\u2019t bright enough to handle tough questions without Zucker pulling his mouth string\u2026\n\nOr maybe Tapper only cares about women and girls when protecting them comes with no personal cost to his status and income, when there\u2019s no downside to his place as a company man who toes the company line\u2026\n\nAll I know is that according to Jake Tapper\u2019s very own senior producer, there appears to be a predator stalking young women at CNN, and no one at CNN will do anything to protect these young women, and Tapper, who does have the status to protect these women, is scurrying away like an enabler in the night\u2026\n\nSome of you might be surprised by this behavior, but after Jake Tapper remained silent as his own audience booed a rape victim, nothing about this sorry excuse for a man would surprise me.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
