Man. \"There's a chance that I won't get compensation because the damage is due to social unrest... I don't think riot damage is covered.\"\n\nWhile businesses flood insurers with claims for such damage, few are likely to be fully compensated as Hong Kong insurance usually protects against events such as fire and natural disasters, such as typhoons.\n\nCoverage for civil unrest, particularly for small and mid-sized firms, is uncommon, industry insiders said.\n\nHong Kong is a lucrative market for global insurers including American International Group, AXA SA and Zurich Insurance Group AG, with the value of premiums as a percentage of gross domestic product at 18.16%, second only to Taiwan in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nTotal insurance premium volume in the territory last year rose 8.3% to $66 billion, the quickest growth rate in the advanced Asia-Pacific region that includes Australia, Japan and Singapore, a Swiss Re study showed.\n\nNear term, Hong Kong insurers expect a surge in demand for coverage that includes riot damage, though profit is likely to suffer from payouts for event cancellations, a drop in demand for travel insurance and, more generally, economic downturn.\n\n\"Overall financial damage from these events will be quite significant and neither insurers nor most of the businesses would have prepared for something like this,\" said an insurance sector lawyer with a global law firm.\n\n\"So you will see a sharp rise in litigation around what's covered and what's not, as well as pressure on earnings of insurance companies because of a surge in claim settlements and a drop in premium income,\" the lawyer said.\n\nThe financial impact of the protests could not be determined with unrest ongoing, but two insurance executives said liabilities for insurers could run into millions of dollars.\n\nThe executives and the lawyer declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.", "description": "Businesses big and small have suffered smashed windows, graffiti and even fire for their perceived support of mainland China by protesters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106192008-1571620103748gettyimages-1173651725.jpeg?v=1571620144", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
