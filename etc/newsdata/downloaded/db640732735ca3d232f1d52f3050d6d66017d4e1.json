That\u2019s Canon.", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: Peter Kramer/HBO\n\nAfter last week\u2019s brilliant, chilling \u201cTern Haven,\u201d Succession has served us another road trip. Welcome to \u201cArgestes,\u201d a business trip utopia where the super rich wear bad vests and lanyards, and argue over overpriced salads. Sure, it looks like a casual suburban steakhouse \u2014 table for six at Logan\u2019s Roadhouse, anyone? \u2014 but it\u2019s where our nation\u2019s finest minds have gathered to solve all the world\u2019s problems. Or to just get richer. Frankly, it\u2019s a little unclear. Here\u2019s where the Roy family, along with their friends and enemies, stand after \u201cArgestes.\u201d (Cousin Greg is unranked this week because he doesn\u2019t have a lot to do, and also, Jesus Christ, let the guy get a little bump bump bump.)\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles-Carter\n\nSomething you should know up front is that it is actually against my religion to rank anything that involves Beyonc\u00e9 and not put her at the top of the list, where she rightfully belongs. Please respect my religious freedom. Kendall calling Shiv \u201cBeyonc\u00e9\u201d \u2014 as a diss \u2014 only shows who should be running the company and who shouldn\u2019t be. Kendall: You might have to go straight to the airport. It\u2019s better for you to go home. Somebody can send your luggage.\n\nNan Pierce\n\nHonestly, I was largely nonplussed by this episode \u2014 New York Magazine expos\u00e9 and all \u2014 until Nan Pierce rolled her eyes and exited her luxury sedan. Roman couldn\u2019t leave well enough alone; he just had to try to push the deal through even faster! Nan starts this episode refusing to wear one of those dumb lanyards with badges (yes this did breathe life back into my decrepit body) and ends the episode calling off the deal, firing Rhea, and storming back to her white-lady fortress (Tern Haven). What was most notable, though, was the absolute glow on her face watching my daughter Shiv on that bullshit panel with her brothers. They talked in circles or not at all; Shiv at least said what people want to hear. Will Nan poach Shiv? Will Shiv defect? I\u2019d like to see it.\n\nShiv Roy\n\nThe Roys showed up to show out at Tern Haven last week, and no one was more hurt by their performance than Shiv. She tried to force Logan\u2019s hand, and where did that get her? In an office with Frank and his Ivy League degrees and dictionaries, or whatever. (Frank remains an extremely bougie mystery to me.)\n\nBut! Well, well, well, how the turntables have \u2014 you know. Suddenly Shiv is more in demand than Meryl Streep at an Oscar-nominees luncheon! Logan wants her to lead the PR on the cruise-ship stuff, Rhea and Fisher Stevens (fine: \u201cHugo\u201d) want her on a panel with her brothers, and Nan glows whenever Shiv opens her mouth. Kendall and Roman commiserate over how she outperforms them, and Marcia chides her for vaguely talking badly about her father. What\u2019s more: Kendall, attempting to shade her, calls her \u201cBeyonc\u00e9\u201d! Shiv is Beyonc\u00e9. That\u2019s canon now.\n\nNew York Magazine\n\nI mean, I work here. This is the magazine that declared Gossip Girl the best period show period ever \u2014 I\u2019d like to see local clown Kendall Roy try to take us down! (I would not like to see this. Please don\u2019t sue us.)\n\nLogan Roy\n\nAttacks on all sides! Even from Logan\u2019s body: He\u2019s wearing the stress from the takeover bid and the PGM negotiations differently. Maybe it\u2019s the altitude, or maybe it\u2019s weighing on him more than ever before. This episode aligns a little too perfectly for my taste, but it certainly makes a point. An episode that shows Logan assuming everything is a plot to take him down \u2014 even abuse allegations on the cruises \u2014 and saying such vile sexist shit is the same one that has Shiv speaking a length about how the way forward is to get rid of the dinosaurs. Between Logan losing the PGM deal and not successfully spreading the rumor that Sandy Furness has syphilis (I absolutely believe this is just something he hatched with Rhea and decided to spread), he\u2019s fucked up as much as Roman. Except he still has control of a company, and Roman has control of absolutely nothing.\n\nMarcia Roy\n\nMarcia, Marcia, Marcia! Marcia overplayed her hand last season, and Logan \u2014 intentionally or not \u2014 has been punishing her for it this season. Finally, though, she\u2019s broken through. When the New York article is on the horizon, she\u2019s the one Logan wants in his corner. Interesting.\n\nTom Wamsgans\n\nThere was no last-minute jockeying related to Tom\u2019s sparsely attended panel, so I guess that\u2019s a win. Or something. Shiv is horny for him, and so is that other woman he was talking to at the party. I want to see Tom have a little thot-umn! But it\u2019s only a matter of time until ATN\u2019s dealings get even dirtier, or until Cyd Peach decides to be done with it all and gut him like a fish.\n\nStewy Hosseini\n\nKendall telling his old pal-turned-new nemesis Stewy that he feels a sense of \u201cregret\u201d about how things have \u201cpanned out\u201d between them is the next viral friendship essay. (Will it lead with \u201cDad\u2019s plan is better\u201d? It ought to.) Stewy is in an enviable position, mostly because I do think \u2014 and have always thought \u2014 he is the most attractive person on this show.\n\nKendall Roy\n\nKendall walks and talks and scans the room like a powerful CEO, but he doesn\u2019t ever have the guts to do anything. He yells at underlings. He fusses with crisis PR. He sits on panels and promises that the company will have more oversight. Blegh! He remains Logan\u2019s errand boy, but with a soft heart.\n\nBanker Danny Huston\n\n\u2026 is back! Something I\u2019ve learned between now and the last time he appeared in this power rankings: His name is Laird.\n\nDanny Huston\u2019s character is \u201cLaird\u201d \u2014 J. Smith-Cameron (@j_smithcameron) September 3, 2019\n\nThank you, J. Smith-Cameron! I love your work. Also can Gerri get an iPhone?\n\nFisher Stevens a.k.a. Hugo Baker\n\nNo, I don\u2019t know what Fisher Stevens is doing here. But I just think attention must be paid to the fact that Fisher Stevens now exists in the Succession universe. And he\u2019s sending links.\n\nRhea Jarrell\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a time to accumulate capital, and there\u2019s a time to spend it,\u201d Rhea tells Shiv, convincing her to sit on that rich-person panel. I miss that moment, the Battle of the Long Bobs, when it seemed like Rhea was really playing all sides of everything. Rhea ends the episode unemployed, when Nan comes to the conclusion that Rhea has been greasing the wheels, but not in PGM\u2019s favor.\n\nRhea likes Logan and Shiv, but she doesn\u2019t seem particularly tickled by anyone else in the Roy family. She\u2019s facing a Pierce lawsuit or safety (if we can call it that) with a family of barn animals. She\u2019s not in a good spot. What\u2019s worse than being between a rock and a hard place? Being between Cherry Jones and whatever Cherry Jones wants, I think.\n\nRoman Roy\n\nI think Roman might actually be as big a moron as everyone things. Does it hurt me to say that? Eh, not really. At every opportunity, he has mucked up anything available to be mucked up. Maybe I\u2019m feeling temperamental, but I\u2019ve kind of had it with his shit. He certainly has the majority of the episode\u2019s best one-liners, but his endgame is getting murky. He wants to run Waystar not because he\u2019s ambitious (Shiv) or because he\u2019s desperate (Kendall), or even because he likes owning things and is afraid of his own mortality (Logan). But when Roman pitched his chair/CEO idea to Gerri, I kept wondering why he\u2019s even still doing this dance. Everything seems lost on him: He couldn\u2019t secure the foreign billionaire, he has no interest in or knowledge of news, he knows less about business than he does about crisis management. Logan slapped him out of anger, but not, I think, because Roman was doing his gleeful elf routine where he spews pithy observations; he slapped him because he knows he raised such a careless fuckup.", "description": "Succession has served us another road trip, to a business utopia where the super rich wear bad vests and lanyards, and argue over overpriced salads.
