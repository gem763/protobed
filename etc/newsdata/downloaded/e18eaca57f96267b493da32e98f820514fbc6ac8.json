You will be held accountable,' Pelosi said in a statement on Tuesday night, responding to a scathing letter from White House Counsel Pat Cipollone.\n\nThe letter asserted that the 'illegitimate' impeachment probe amounted to an illegal attempt to overturn the 2016 election, and announced that the White House would not respond to Congressional subpoenas in the matter.\n\n'This letter is manifestly wrong, and is simply another unlawful attempt to hide the facts of the Trump Administration's brazen efforts to pressure foreign powers to intervene in the 2020 elections,' Pelosi said in her response.\n\n'Despite the White House's stonewalling, we see a growing body of evidence that shows that President Trump abused his office and violated his oath to 'protect, preserve and defend the Constitution',' she continued.\n\n'The President's actions threaten our national security, violate our Constitution and undermine the integrity of our elections. The White House letter is only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy, and to insist that the President is above the law,' Pelosi said.\n\n'Mr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable,' Pelosi (above with college Adam Schiff) said in a statement on Tuesday night\n\nTrump earlier announced his refusal to participate in the impeachment probe, with the White House counsel writing in a letter to Congress that the inquiry is 'illegitimate'\n\nNancy Pelosi's full statement 'For a while, the President has tried to normalize lawlessness. Now, he is trying to make lawlessness a virtue. The American people have already heard the President's own words \u2013 'do us a favor, though.' The President's actions threaten our national security, violate our Constitution and undermine the integrity of our elections. The White House letter is only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy, and to insist that the President is above the law. 'This letter is manifestly wrong, and is simply another unlawful attempt to hide the facts of the Trump Administration's brazen efforts to pressure foreign powers to intervene in the 2020 elections. Despite the White House's stonewalling, we see a growing body of evidence that shows that President Trump abused his office and violated his oath to 'protect, preserve and defend the Constitution.' 'The White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the President's abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction. 'Mr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable.'\n\nCipollone's scathing, eight-page missive, was tantamount to a declaration of political war.\n\n'Put simply, you seek to overturn the results of the 2016 election and deprive the American people of the President they have freely chosen,' White House Counsel Pat Cipollone wrote to the speaker and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings and Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engle, who are overseeing the inquiry.\n\nIn the letter, Cipollone argued the president and his administration 'reject your baseless, unconstitutional efforts to overturn the democratic process' and would not cooperate with subpoena requests.\n\n'Your unprecedented actions have left the President with no choice,' he wrote. 'In order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his Administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.'\n\nCipollone danced around the issue of a full House vote on an impeachment inquiry, stopping short of directly calling for one, because the GOP would likely lose in the Democratic-controlled chamber and some Republican lawmakers would be uneasy about being put in the politically tough spot of having to go on the record.\n\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone included political red meat in his scathing letter to Democrats on impeachment\n\nHe also hinted the administration would become more cooperative if Democrats dropped the formal impeachment inquiry and returned to 'regular order.'\n\n'If the Committees wish to return to the regular order of oversight requests, we stand ready to engage in that process as we have in the past, in a manner consistent with well-established bipartisan constitutional protections and a respect for the separation of powers enshrined in our Constitution,' he wrote.\n\nBut Pelosi outlined her stance in a letter to fellow Democrats before she received the White House missive, making it clear the impeachment inquiry will go forward.\n\nShe also charged the president with obstruction of justice - a charge Democrats see as an impeachable offense - and said the Constitution gives the lawmakers the authority to continue their investigation.\n\n'As President Trump is obstructing justice, abusing power and diminishing the office of the presidency, we have a responsibility to strengthen the institution in which we serve. This is essential if we are to honor the separation of powers which is the genius of the Constitution,' the speaker wrote earlier Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe White House pushed back on the Democrats' obstruction argument.\n\n'That's a political argument, not a legal argument,' a senior administration official said on a call with reporters.\n\nThe White House letter reads more like a political argument than a legal one. It's filled with provocative, fiery language, and hurls insults at some of the key Democratic players in the impeachment process.\n\nCipollone outlines a series of demands from the White House, including presenting evidence, calling witnesses, having White House counsel at all hearings, and letting them cross-examine the witnesses.\n\nHe also requests, on behalf of Republican lawmakers, the power to subpoena witnesses.\n\nThat power belongs to the majority party in Congress. Democrats, for example, could not use it when Republicans controlled the chamber.\n\nCipollone also argues 'your inquiry is constitutionally invalid and a violation of due process' because the full House did not vote on proceeding with an impeachment inquiry.\n\nHowever, he stops short of blatantly calling for such a vote.\n\nBut senior administration officials did not tell reporters which or all of their demands would need to be met to ensure the president's and his staff's cooperation with Democrats.\n\nCipollone does not have much of a legal leg to stand on in his requests. Article I on the Constitution gives the House of Representatives 'the sole Power of Impeachment.'\n\nHis letter also echoes some of the political attacks President Trump has made in his own defense, particularly in its attacks on Schiff.\n\nCipollone attacked Schiff for his opening statement at a hearing last month that mocked the president's phone conversation with the president of the Ukraine, a move Trump has railed against and argued Schiff should be arrested for treason for doing.\n\nHe also cited a report that the whistle-blower who first drew attention to the contents of the president's call reached out to staff on the Intelligence committee on how to proceed.\n\nAnd he threw out some political red meat in his chewing out of the Democrats.\n\n'The effort to impeach President Trump \u2014 without regard to any evidence of his actions in office \u2014 is a naked political strategy that began the day he was inaugurated, and perhaps even before,' Cipollone wrote.\n\nThe letter from the White House counsel echoed President Trump's political attacks on Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff\n\nThe administration vowed last week to send Pelosi a letter arguing the president can ignore Democrats' demands for witnesses and documentation in their impeachment inquiry.\n\nPelosi argues the blessing of the full House isn't necessary for Democrats to proceed in their inquiry.\n\nThere 'is no requirement under the Constitution, under House Rules, or House precedent that the whole House vote before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry,' she told House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy in a letter last week after he urged her to hold a vote in the full House.\n\nGiven that Pelosi's party holds the majority in the chamber, such a measure would be expected to pass.\n\nBut Republicans could be concerned about support slipping among their own lawmakers.\n\nPelosi has made such an argument.\n\n'There's some Republicans that are very nervous about our bringing that vote to the floor,' she said a press conference on Capitol Hill last week.\n\nPolls indicate support among Americans - and slowly among Republicans - is building for the Democrats' impeachment inquiry.\n\nA Washington Post-Schar School poll out Tuesday showed 28 per cent of Republicans support the inquiry, a new high.\n\nAnd some GOP lawmakers, like Representative Mark Amodei of Nevada, have indicated an openness to the inquiry, saying Congress should follow the facts in the case. Congressman Fred Upton of Michigan said there are 'legitimate questions' about Trump's request of the Ukrainian president in their July 25 phone call.\n\nA vote now on an impeachment inquiry could lock in GOP lawmakers to the president's side before further cracks in support show up.\n\nAnd it would force them on the record at a time many of them have remained silent about the president's predicament.\n\nThere is talk that, privately, not all Republicans are on the president's side.\n\nFormer Arizona Senator Jeff Flake claimed 'at least 35' Republican senators would vote to impeach Trump - if they could do it on a secret ballot.\n\n'I heard someone say if there were a private vote there would be 30 Republican votes,' he told the Texas Tribune Festival last month. 'That's not true. There would be at least 35.'\n\nThe president does have his public supporters though. McCarthy and Republican lawmaker Jim Jordan have been vocal and public in their backing the president.\n\n'You have a speaker of the House that said we need to strike while the iron is hot and the chairman of the committee who is so bias against this president,' Jordan complained on Tuesday in the Capitol of Pelosi and Schiff.\n\nThe resistance movement by the Trump administration has already started when the president directed Gordon Sondland, his ambassador to the European Union, not to testify before lawmakers on Tuesday.\n\nA series of text messages released by the House Intelligence Committee last week place Sondland at the center of talks involving the Ukrainians, U.S. diplomats, and Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe White House has played hardball with Democrats, forbidding EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland from testifying before lawmakers\n\nLawmakers wanted to speak to him about the texts and about additional texts and emails they claim are in his possession.\n\nHouse Democrats, in response, subpoenaed Sondland and directed him to appear before them at a hearing next Thursday at 9:30 a.m. and produce the requested documents by the preceding Tuesday.\n\nThe Democrats warn him if he doesn't show up, even at the request of the president, it would be seen as an obstruction of their impeachment inquiry.\n\n'Your failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena, including at the direction or behest of the president, the White House, or the State Department, shall constitute further evidence of obstruction of the House's impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the president,' the letter to him states.\n\nIf the Trump administration directs him to ignore the subpoena, the matter is likely to end up in the courts.", "description": "'Mr. President, you are not above the law.
