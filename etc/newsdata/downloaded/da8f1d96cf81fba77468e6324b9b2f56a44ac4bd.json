For three years, he has been consumed by an obsession to win a major championship medal, after missing out on Olympic bronze by just three thousandths of a second. Here in this 200 metres duel in the desert, he again fell agonisingly short, squeezed out of the podium places by a mere five hundredths in fourth as the irresistible Noah Lyles took gold. For an athlete almost masochistic in using failure as his inspiration, it was a chastening evening.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHe was in tears as he made his way through the interview area, needing to be consoled by his mother, Sacha. Gemili could hardly in be faulted in how he judged his race, matching his season\u2019s best of 20.03sec, but the competition \u2013 in the form of Lyles, Canada\u2019s Andre Grasse, and fast-rising Ecuadorean Alex Quinonez \u2013 was simply too fierce. He keeps a document on his phone listing all his detractors\u2019 most stinging rebukes, and had suggested he would disclose the contents if he achieved his goal of a maiden individual medal at major championships. Alas, the dossier will have to be updated a while longer.\n\nTrue to form, Gemili was stinging in his self-reproach, after being overhauled by Quinonez only a few strides from the line. \u201cI ran like an amateur,\u201d he said. \u201cI am gutted, as I had it but lost my balance. I had nothing left at the end, but all my form went out of the window. I cannot believe it. I came so close, as this was such a good chance. My body feels good and I ran well through the heats, but I let it go. It\u2019s the same, if not worse, than the feeling in Rio.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, because I feel I have let down so many people. So many sent me messages, and the team know I have been plagued with injuries. Not to break 20 seconds is disappointing, heartbreaking. I had the medal and it slipped out of my hands. Ultimately, I have to take the positives. I had been labelled a relay runner, I had been written off. At those times you need a tight-knit group of people around you. It hasn\u2019t happened here, but it has re-lit something inside me. If I go to Tokyo for the Olympics, it\u2019s winnable.\u201d\n\nLyles might reasonably take issue with that verdict. The American, who rounded off a superlative year with his first world title, has already run 19.50s this season, over four tenths faster than Gemili has managed in his life. \u201cSo many times I thought in my brain that I would be world champion this year,\u201d said Lyles, only 22. \u201cI have it on my phone, I have been saying it since the season started. Every day I\u2019ve been hitting my car window on the way back from practice as the music blasted out. This is my first one, and I don\u2019t know a lot of people who can say they came to their first worlds and grabbed the gold.\u201d\n\nNoah Lyles took the gold medal in the men's 200 final in Doha Credit: GETTY IMAGES\n\nThe evening\u2019s most eye-catching performance belonged to Donavan Brazier, who streaked away from his pursuers in the 800m to win in a time of 1min 42.34s, an American record and the fastest time set at world championships. The one inconvenient detail was that the 22-year-old\u2019s coach, Alberto Salazar, had been kicked out of Doha in ignominy just hours earlier after the US Anti-Doping Agency found him guilty of doping offences.\n\nDina Asher-Smith advanced with graceful ease to tonight\u2019s final of the 200 metres, where she has become the clear favourite for victory after the withdrawal of Jamaica\u2019s Elaine Thompson, the reigning Olympic champion. With the absences of Holland\u2019s Dafne Schippers and Marie-Josee Ta Lou, not to mention the decision by Bahamian Shaunae Miller-Uibo to prioritise the 400, the field has scattered for Asher-Smith to seize the first ever global gold medal by a British female sprinter.", "description": "Adam Gemili could be forgiven for feeling cursed on the global stage.
