Some 400,000 U.S. overdose deaths between 1997 and 2017 were linked to opioids, according to government data.\n\n\"While the companies strongly dispute the allegations made by the two counties, they believe settling the bellwether trial is an important stepping stone to achieving a global resolution,\" the distributors said in a joint statement.\n\nHanly said his team rejected a proposed $18 billion settlement last week from the three distributors because the payments were due to be made over 18 yeas.\n\n\"One billion dollars for the entire year is a ham sandwich,\" said Hanly. \"It's way too small an amount.\"\n\nTeva and attorneys general for four states pushed to salvage a deal they had reached last week, which was rejected by the team representing local governments.\n\nNorth Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein told reporters on a conference call that he and his counterparts in Pennsylvania, Texas and Tennessee had an agreement in principle with the distributors as well.\n\nHe said the deal was comprised of $22 billion in cash and $26 billion in treatment drugs.\n\nTeva said it had agreed with the four attorneys general to contribute opioid treatment drugs worth $23 billion, as well as $250 million in cash over 10 years.\n\nThe other contributions to the broader settlement were to come from the distributors.\n\n\n\n\n\n'POSITIVE MOMENTUM'\n\nIt was not clear if the settlement framework the four states announced would receive support from other states or the local governments, who had previously contended it was inadequate.\n\nPennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said he believed \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of positive momentum\u201d after Friday\u2019s settlement talks, which he said also included Johnson & Johnson.\n\nIn a statement, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said other attorneys general \"don't speak for Ohio.\"\n\nHe added, \"This isn't a framework, it's a pile of lumber that's been dropped on the construction site. Ohio will wait and see what the detailed plan looks like.\"\n\nHanly said the attorneys general deal was spread over too many years to be acceptable. He said he did not expect the attorneys general to participate when talks resumed this week.\n\nThe so-called bellwether, or test trial, that had been set for Monday could have helped shape a broader settlement of some 2,600 lawsuits pending over the toll opioids have taken on local communities and the nation.\n\nShares in the companies had risen last week in anticipation of a broader deal. On Monday, shares of the big three drug distributors were down as much as 5% but recovered after Teva's statement and closed down around 2% to 3%.\n\n\"We are not surprised to see distributor shares giving back some of last week\u2019s gains as uncertainty persists in this extremely complex litigation,\" Baird analyst Eric Coldwell wrote in a note.\n\nThe settlement, if extrapolated to a nationwide deal resolving all litigation for the four defendants, suggests a settlement value of around $48 billion, based on a court-approved allocation formula. Hanly said he had not done the same calculation, but thought it was likely worth more.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Four large drug companies could resume talks on Tuesday to try to reach a $48 billion settlement of all opioid litigation against them, after agreeing with two Ohio counties to a $260 million deal to avert the first federal trial over their role in the U.S. opioid epidemic.
