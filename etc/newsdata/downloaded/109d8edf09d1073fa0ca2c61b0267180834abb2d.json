The young guns are moving in.\n\nEvery NFL game in Week 4 featured at least one starting quarterback age 26 or younger. There has already been a total of 52 such games this season, the most through four weeks of a season in league history. The previous high was 48 in 1987.\n\nThat happened after 20 quarterbacks age 26 or younger started in Week 3, most ever in one week.\n\nBrady (42), Philip Rivers (37), Aaron Rodgers (35), Matt Ryan (34), Joe Flacco (34), Matthew Stafford (31), Kirk Cousins (31), Andy Dalton (31) and Russell Wilson (30) are the remaining starters in their 30s. Chase Daniel (32) is filling in for the injured Mitchell Trubisky this week.\n\nDrew Brees (40), Ben Roethlisberger (37) and Cam Newton (30) are injured. Eli Manning (38), Ryan Fitzpatrick (36) and Case Keenum (31) were benched.\n\nThe NFL is in good hands moving forward with Patrick Mahomes, Carson Wentz, Dak Prescott, Baker Mayfield and Jared Goff.\n\nHere\u2019s a look inside more entering Week 5:\n\nIMPRESSIVE ALLEN: Carolina\u2019s Kyle Allen joined Wentz as the only quarterbacks to go 3-0 with zero interceptions in their first three career starts.\n\nPICK IT: Patriots defensive back Devin McCourty is the first player in franchise history and the first in the NFL since Minnesota\u2019s Brian Russell in 2003 to record an interception in each of his team\u2019s first four games of a season. Russell\u2019s record streak was six.\n\n300 CLUB: Mahomes and Ryan have thrown for at least 300 yards in each of their four games. Only Peyton Manning (five), Steve Young (six) and Kurt Warner (six) had longer streaks to start a season.\n\nDUAL THREAT: Baltimore\u2019s Lamar Jackson is tied for the league lead with 10 touchdown passes and also leads all quarterbacks with 238 yards rushing yards.\n\nONLY JERRY AHEAD: Arizona\u2019s Larry Fitzgerald moved ahead of Tony Gonzalez into second place on the all-time list with 1,326 career receptions. Only Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice has more with 1,549.\n\nSELECT COMPANY: Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey joined Pro Football Hall of Famer Jim Brown as the only players in league history with three games of at least 175 scrimmage yards and one TD in their team\u2019s first four games of a season.\n\nELITE GROUP: Frank Gore became the fourth player in league history to rush for 15,000 yards, joining Pro Football Hall of Famers Emmitt Smith (18,355), Walter Payton (16,726) and Barry Sanders (15,269).\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Look out, Tom Brady and the rest of the old heads.
