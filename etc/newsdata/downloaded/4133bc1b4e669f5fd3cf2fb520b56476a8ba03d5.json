The astonishing fact is that there is none,' writes Levin.\n\n'Furthermore, laboratory studies have shown that some terrestrial microorganisms could survive and grow on Mars.'\n\nLevin pointed to a pair of missions in 1976 when NASA sent its Viking Landers 1 and 2 to Mars - the agency's first-ever trip to the Red Planet.\n\nWhile there, the landers took several samples from the Martian soil in an attempt to search contents for signs of biological life.\n\nPictures from NASA's first Mars landing (above) were among the benefits reaped from the Viking missions\n\nOne of the tests called the Labeled Release life detection experiment, which was spearheaded by Levin, involved combining martian soil samples with organic compounds and then looking for signs of carbon dioxide.\n\nAny microorganisms that were present in the soil would have metabolized the compound and released CO2, says Levin.\n\nShockingly, the tests initially turned up a significant four positive results and we duplicated by both landers located 4,000 miles apart on the planet.\n\nDespite the initial success, however, further experimentation from NASA turned up empty-handed when NASA searched for specific microorganisms.\n\nAccording to the NASA, the tests 'provided no clear evidence for the presence of living microorganisms in soil near the landing sites.'\n\nNonetheless, Levin says evidence of alien life has been bolstered by other discoveries since the Viking missions like evidence of water and other organic compounds and the failure of 43 subsequent studies on the finding to provide a direct explanation.", "description": "A NASA spokesperson rebutted claims from Gilbert Levin, a NASA employee who helped to spearhead the agency's first trip to Mars in 1976 after he penned an op-ed last week.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/18/19602964-0-image-a-21_1571418487622.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
