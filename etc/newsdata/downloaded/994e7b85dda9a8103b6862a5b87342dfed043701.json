Source: Royal London.\n\nFormer Pensions Minister Steve Webb, now policy director at Royal London, warned the state pension increase has a sting in the tail for over-75 who will lose the right to free TV licences next summer.\n\n'Next June those not on pension credit will be required to pay for a TV licence rather than receiving it for free. The current cost of a TV licence is \u00a3154.50 per year and will rise again next year,' he pointed out.\n\n'Royal London has calculated that, taking account of the loss of free TV licences, 1.7 million single pensioners over 75 will face a cut in their real living standards next year.\n\n'This is because their pension increase, once the TV licence has been deducted, will be just 1.6 per cent - lower than today\u2019s rate of inflation which was 1.7 per cent.\n\n'This makes it all the more important that older pensioners check if they might be entitled to claim pension credit so that the poorest pensioners do not face this squeeze.'\n\nState pension increase has a sting in the tail for over-75 who will lose the right to free TV licences next summer, says Royal London\n\nAndrew Tully, technical director at Canada Life, said: 'The increase to state pensions will be a very welcome above-inflation boost for the many retirees who are looking to balance household budgets.\n\n'This is the third highest increase in the new state pension since the triple lock guarantee was introduced and the third time the state pension has been increased by wage growth.\n\n'This increase does cast a spotlight on the long-term sustainability of the triple lock although government has committed to it in this parliament or until 2022, whichever comes sooner.'\n\nThe triple lock was introduced by the Coalition Government in 2011, and Canada Life shows how the state pension has been uprated over the years in the table below.", "description": "The basic state pension is set to rise by \u00a35.05 a week to \u00a3134.25, while those on the full flat rate introduced in 2016 will see their payouts increase by around \u00a36.60 a week to \u00a3175.20.", "authors": ["Tanya Jefferies For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
