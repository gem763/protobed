Re-live the action live:\n\nGood morning and welcome to another day of Ashes cricket, as England return to their default survival mode to keep the series alive. They start Day Three on 23-1, 474 runs behind with a full day of batting ahead. If all goes to plan. Australia have won the first two days and they accumulated a monster first innings total. England's only job is to chip away at the total and bat as long as possible. The bad news is that the sky above Old Trafford is dark. Grey clouds and rain have been coming down this morning and a delay to the start of the day seems likely. More rain is due to come down over the course of the morning but it should clear up into the afternoon. This is the current view of the pitch at Old Trafford. Completely covered, the rain is expected to clear in the next hour or so... but until then it's a waiting game. Advertisement The Ashes hang by a thread after two pretty woeful days for England. They were batted into oblivion by a fantastic double hundred from Steve Smith. England weren't without chances yesterday. Jofra Archer put Smith down on 68 with Jack Leach finally dismissing him but having bowled a no ball. Smith was ably partnered but the Australian captain Tim Paine. He made a hard fought 58 before Craig Overton nicked him off after tea. But Smith just batted and batted and batted some more. He made 211 and earned the respect of the Old Trafford crowd. Day three is due to start in 15 minutes time. The rain has made that start time null and void, the forecast says it should clear around 1 o'clock so we could lose a session today at least. Steve Smith has scored 589 runs in the series having batted just fourth times, with his innings at Lords interrupted by a concussion. What's the secret to his success? The desire for chocolate apparently. On his double hundred yesterday Smith said: \"I went home, had a little bit of dinner and Peter Siddle popped over to Sainsbury's and got me a big block of Dairy Milk. That's my treat - when I get a hundred I reward myself with chocolate. \"I got stuck into that. I usually finish it but I've got some left over. \"When you spend some time out in the middle, you reward yourself properly. I jut like the plain stuff.\" RAIN STOPS PLAY It's official. Rain has delayed the start of play, could the weather be a saviour for England? Advertisement Hunker down, it's very, very wet out there. Even if the rain stops right now it will take some time to get the ground fit for play. We're looking at another hour before the start at the least. When play does resume England's two gladiators will be Rory Burns and Craig Overton. They're tasked with bringing England into a position to avoid defeat. The good news is the outfield covers are being removed. Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood are the Australian seamers tasked to keep England under lock and key. Cummins and Hazlewood have proven throughout the series that they are more than up to the task. Cummins in particular has been causing trouble for England's batsmen with the short ball. Rory Burns has fallen to Cummins three times and will need to find a way to counter that method of attack. Starc is playing in his first test match of the series. He plundered a very tidy England bowling attack around last night to make an entertaining fifty. Speaking about getting his chance to play in the series he said: \"It was nice to be out with the boys. Steve Smith, what a player he is. We are very fortunate he's on our side of the fence. He''s been on fire through the series so far. \"It's always frustrating not playing. The great thing about this group of players and fast bowlers in particular is we've sort of grown up together, we're really close off the field. \"As much as you want to play, you're backing your mate to do the job as well. That's the great thing, its all about the squad mentality. \"It's taken a few of us a bit of persuading to get on board with being rested and rotated. Having six guys fit and ready to go, that's the great thing about this group.\" Advertisement It isn't looking great out there. The covers did go off but they're now back on the pitch. Rob Bailey, the fourth umpire, is out in the middle assessing the conditions, he keeps looking up at the dark, grey sky hoping to see a slither of blue. No luck so far. England snatched victory from the jaws of defeat in the previous test match at Headingley. At Old Trafford they have to repeat the performance. England's first innings will be crucial. They need to bat and bat long. England's middle order is their engine room. The form of Jason Roy, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow and Jos Buttler are where this match can tilt. For England to have the best chance of rescuing this test match, Rory Burns, Joe Root and possibly Craig Overton have to set the platform and do their best to run down the Australian bowlers. There's no update on a start time. The covers are still secure over the pitch and the super soakers are mopping up the outfield. The realistic view here is that the players will probably take an early lunch while the groundstaff continue to make the ground playable. There's going to be an official inspection at 1pm. Lunch will be taken early at 12:30pm, the rain has stopped so we should get some play this afternoon. Advertisement In preparation for the inspection at 1pm , the covers are being taken off the pitch. Blue skies have appeared over Old Trafford. Over on TMS right now, Freddie Flintoff is being interviewed by Aggers. He's talking about his aspirations to coach the England cricket at some point further down the line. Trevor Bayliss is leaving at the end of the summer, could Freddie be the next in line? In cricket adjacent news, Australian cricket journalist Peter Lalor was charged \u00a355,000 for a beer in a Manchester hotel last night. \u00a355,000?! Signs are pretty good for the start of play happening pretty soon. The covers have all been removed, including the hover cover that protects the wicket. The inspection will be happening at 1pm. Lunch is due to finish at 1.10pm so an optimistic start time to day three will be in about 20-25 minutes. It was an optimistic guess but we won't have to wait much longer. The official start time is 1:30pm. 35 minutes until the start of play. Looking up at the sky and based on the weather forecast there should no more interruptions due to inclement weather today. Play will go on until about 7:30pm so there'll still be quite a lot of cricket.
