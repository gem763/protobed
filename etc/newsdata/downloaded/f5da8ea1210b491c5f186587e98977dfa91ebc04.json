Meryl Streep in Out Of Africa of course.\n\n\n\nMy best mate Zoe and I decided we had to have cotton clothes: cool and chic with lots of neutral beiges with khaki, olive and brown tones. But trying to find a 'cool, chic and practical' safari wardrobe is another matter.\n\n\n\nThe selection was much too clich\u00e9d. I didn't want something that said 'big-game hunter' and 'first-time safari' \u2013 all hard helmets and mosquito-repellent impregnated nylon shirts. There's nothing chic about that. So, we had to resort to digging out everything remotely safari-esque from our wardrobes.\n\nGirl's night out: Lisa joins Samburu women at a traditional dance\n\nWe were warned not to take anything blue as that attracts the tsetse fly, which carries a horrible sleeping illness, and nothing bright or white as that would hardly help us to blend into the landscape.\n\n\n\nWe were visiting three different locations in Nairobi and around Kenya. Our first stop after the BA flight from London to Nairobi was Giraffe Manor, a gorgeous old house set in 140 acres.\n\n\n\nWe pulled up at night and were led to a candlelit dining room and served a delicious homely meal of potpie and a big glass of wine before being shown to our room for the night.There were ten rooms named after giraffes that lived or had lived there. Our room was called Lynn, a giraffe we were assured would be waiting at our window first thing in the morning and would be expecting to be fed.\n\n\n\nWe were told to open our window and feed Lynn the bran pellets that were sitting on a dressing table in a metal pale. Super excited but sleepy we fell asleep in our twin beds in a romantically decorated room under mosquito nets. I opened my eyes at around 6.30am to see Zoe slowly stirring; we looked at each other, smiled, climbed out from under our nets and rushed over to open the window.\n\n\n\nSure enough, Lynn \u2013 a beautiful, graceful creature \u2013 was gently lolloping over to see us. She stuck her face into the room, not shy at all. Nervously we held out the pellets at arm's reach not sure what to expect. Lynn's long black tongue gently curled out of her mouth and snaked around the pellet as she batted her beautiful long eyelashes in appreciation. It was such a treat and we continued feeding her till most of the pellets had gone.\n\n\n\nHungry visitor: Lynn the giraffe popped in for breakfast on Lisa and Zoe's first day\n\nWe made our way downstairs to the breakfast room where huge windows looked out on to beautiful lawns. There were four giraffes with their incredibly long necks elegantly bowed down inside the windows, sharing breakfast with other guests. Alongside the giraffes were warthogs and their babies, who were oinking and snorting around, also trying to be fed \u2013 so cute and reminiscent of Pumbaa from The Lion King.\n\n\n\nOur next destination was Solio Lodge in Laikipia. The lodge nestles between Mount Kenya and the Aberdare mountains and is set in acres and acres of open grass conservation land. Here they protect and breed the black rhino, which is continually in danger of being poached and becoming extinct.\n\n\n\nWe booked a helicopter to take us, as by road it would take about four hours and we didn't have time to waste. We set off over the gorgeous landscape looking out beneath us, praying to see herds of wild animals stampeding by. We flew over stunning canyons and the Aberdares with pilot Jamie and our guide William pointing out rose, tea and coffee farms \u2013 Kenya's main exports \u2013 along the way. As we came into land at Solio we spotted a lion and lioness just below us before they ran off. This was the most wonderful, exciting thing we'd ever seen and were told by the boys that they hadn't been spotted in months. We had been blessed by the safari gods.\n\n\n\nWild bunch:Lisa spotted a lioness tearing into a freshly-killed zebra\n\nThe lodge was impressive, modern yet homely with an open fire, a bar, a dining room and a huge staircase leading to a mezzanine. Our bedrooms were spacious and had fireplaces while the bathrooms had free-standing bathtubs and huge, glass-fronted showers with panoramic views of the surrounding landscape and Mount Kenya. While unpacking, a family of zebras walked past, stopping to graze right outside my window.\n\n\n\nWe met Avo the manager and had a lunch outside, while watching various game walk by. We decided on a massage in our rooms followed by an afternoon of drinking tea and eating homemade biscuits before a yummy evening meal.\n\nThe next morning we were up at 4am for our first-ever game drive. It was cold and we had to wrap up as we set off with William in a 4x4. Zoe and I sat up on the roof, eager to spot the wildlife. We didn't have long to wait as we came across white rhino straight away. Next we saw baby leopards, probably brother and sister, rolling around playing with one another. We also spotted buffaloes and bushbuck, eland and oryx antelopes. To finish off an incredible morning we stumbled upon a lone black rhino \u2013 it's usual to find them on their own as they are unsociable creatures.\n\n\n\nThere were many guards on watch at all times in and around the lodge to stop poachers. It made us so angry to know that the rhinos were in danger of being killed, their tusks sold mostly into the Japanese and Chinese markets: such a cruel waste.\n\n\n\nSwimming trunks: Lisa sees elephants crossing a river - several of hundreds she came across at in the Samburu region\n\nBack at the ranch Avo introduced us to Solio's newest arrival, a tiny bush baby jumping around with freakishly big eyes and webbed toes. The next morning we woke up again before the sun, eager to see more. We came across the most intense scene, a lioness hungrily tearing into the flesh of a freshly killed zebra. Gruesome yet mesmerising. We watched, trying to get a closer look. Eventually the lioness spotted us, became uncomfortable and ran off. We followed her with our binoculars in the direction of some trees and under them was another lioness and about half a dozen young cubs. It was a wonderful thing to see.\n\n\n\nHappy and content we headed back to the lodge for another delicious lunch. As we were eating, Avo got a call from the guards. One of the black rhino had been injured and doctors had been called: would we like to go along? Try stopping us.\n\n\n\nWe all set off in various jeeps bouncing along the slightly rough terrain. We found it with its back right leg badly injured with deep open bloody cuts that looked infected. The rhino had to be tranquillised to get a proper look and to treat the cuts. This turned out to be quite a tricky operation \u2013 it needed about ten guards to hold it down.\n\n\n\nIt had been another amazing day at Solio. We were sad to leave the next morning but happy to see the Tropic Air chopper coming into land to pick us up to take us to our final destination: Sasaab in northern Kenya. The flight took us across the equator.\n\n\n\nFriendly faces: Lisa and Zoe meet locals children and become the centre of attention\n\nSasaab was so different from the our previous locations. Set on the banks of the river Ewaso Nyiro, the landscape was more barren and less lush than Solio and much less sophisticated than The Giraffe Manor.\n\n\n\nThis was the Samburu region. Sasaab had a very Moorish feel, with lots of whitewashed walls, beautiful archways and lanterns, and an infinity pool looking down on to stunning views of the river and a spa. There were nine rooms: you could describe them as a cross between posh tents and bungalows, spacious and all with plunge pools and outside bathrooms which made showering at dusk interesting: a multitude of bugs and moths descended on you. Above was an immense, starry night sky.\n\n\n\nTanya and Doug, an Australian couple, run Sasaab. Our evenings were spent sitting under the stars eating together and exchanging stories. Safari is a very social experience. We set off early the next day with a safari picnic.\n\n\n\nWe met Sammy our guide and Jacob, a stunning warrior from the Samburu tribe who was dressed in all his regalia. He was our spotter. Sasaab is also a wildlife conservancy, helping to protect the Ewaso lions who are in danger of becoming extinct and the Grevy's zebras (named after a former French president).\n\n\n\nWe saw hundreds of elephants: some feeding by the river, others crossing the road. When we met them on the road we had to stop, turn off the engine and avoid making eye contact for risk of being charged (a situation both exhilarating and terrifying).\n\n\n\nJet set: Lisa and Zoe hopped between safari lodges by helicopter\n\nThere were also beautiful reticulated giraffe, native to Somalia and the Samburu region, and a vast array of exotic birds, springbok and beisa oryx.\n\nWe were invited the next day to a local village. Gorgeous children and a few silent, moody warriors welcomed us; we were invited into a manyatta, a small hut where a family lived and slept. The roof was a shell made from goat fat, clothes and paper. The children were taken with Zoe and I, playing with our hair and trying to rub our skin to see if the white came off. We played with them for hours.\n\n\n\nThat evening, back at Sasaab, we were told we were going for a walk, so we set off with Jacob and a couple of other warriors. We were met with two camels and Zoe and I hopped on and had an incredible ride, ending the day with a vodka sundowner on a hill with incredible views, followed by sausages cooked by Jacob on a camp fire.\n\n\n\nOur last day was spent out and about with a picnic by the river. We followed a family of lions for hours and got close to them. Back at Sasaab that afternoon Zoe and I relaxed by the pool and I had a pedicure.\n\n\n\nOn the last evening we went to see a display of dancing by the Samburu men and women down by the river. It was a lively jumping dance that involved all the warriors in their glory showing off and claiming their future wives. It was a mesmerising and an electric atmosphere, everyone dressed up and all the young girls hoping to be noticed by the warriors.\n\n\n\nI joined in the dancing: the rhythm and vibrations were intoxicating and it was the most fantastic end to an incredible trip.\n\n", "description": "Lisa Snowdon discovers what it's like to really get up close and personal with the wildlife on a Kenyan safari - starting with inviting Lynn the giraffe for breakfast.", "authors": ["Lisa Snowdon"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/19/article-0-1ACE093D00000578-404_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2014-01-19"}
