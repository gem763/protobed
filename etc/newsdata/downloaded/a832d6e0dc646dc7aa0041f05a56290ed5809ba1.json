Sounds simple enough right? But does it actually work?\n\nWe put it to the test.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nWhen we tried to deseed the delicious fruit, we struggled to rip it off as effortlessly as seen in the video.\n\nEven using our fancy new knife, the stubborn flesh of the pomegranate did not separate from the seed.\n\nAnd also, unlike the viral clip, the white flesh was not as perfectly divided into equal parts.\n\nOthers have claimed that it works perfectly for them. According to Twitter users reacting to the clip, they are able to get mess-free results.\n\nA social media strategist, Josh Billinson, commented on the video saying: \u2018It does but I\u2019m lazy so I\u2019ll just cut it however and then break it apart submerged in a bowl of water to separate the seeds from the flesh super easily.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Josh, another person who has a pomegranate tree vouched for the trick but preferred a different method.\n\nThey wrote: \u2018It looks like it does. We have a pomegranate tree [but] I just rinse and break them up in a bowl of water. The rind floats to the top and the seeds sink to the bottom. Super easy-peasy. We have gallon bags full of seeds!\u2019\n\nOthers in the viral thread claimed the trick has worked for them too. But many people wondered why the hack was demonstrated on a fruit still attached to the tree (we\u2019re wondering the same).\n\nAs the technique involves cutting off the top and then into separate fragments and then pulling those apart, some wondered why you wouldn\u2019t just rip it off first.\n\n\u2018Does this work when it\u2019s not still on the tree?\u2019 quipped one person while another wrote: \u2018How to effectively slice a pomegranate: Rule 1: Don\u2019t pluck it first.\u2019\n\nOthers wondered about the safety aspect of using such a sharp knife without having something to rest it on.\n\nI couldn't tell you because the knife work seems so finger-loppingly incautious that it was scaring the hell out of me and I had to look away. \u2014 patt morrison (@pattmlatimes) October 20, 2019\n\n\u2018For me this would work more like \u201chow to effectively slice off a hand\u201d,\u2019 chimed one person while another echoed the thought, saying: \u2018That\u2019s one sharp survival\u2026I mean, pomegranate cutting knife. Yowza. I\u2019m gonna try it, but I\u2019m also gonna have a first aid kit close by.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome said the easiest way to do is to just beat the back of the pomegranate with a wooden spoon. Sounds easy enough.
