The company announced the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL at the event in New York. The Pixel 4 starts at $799, is available for pre-order today and ships on Oct. 4. For the first time, Google said the Pixel 4 is available for purchase from every major U.S. carrier. The Pixel 4 includes big improvements to the night sight camera, to the point where Google is confident you can use it to capture pictures of stars in the night sky, even the Milky Way galaxy. Most phones can't do that.\n\nTodd Haselton | CNBC\n\nThe Pixel 4 also has a new 90hz display, the second such device after the OnePlus 7 Pro to offer it. This makes scrolling much smoother than on traditional displays, but at the cost of battery life. Google will let you turn it on and off manually. It also has new radar detection for gestures. That means you can use the radar, known as Soli, to swipe in the air across your screen to move through music, photos and more. Google says new capabilities will come later. The Pixel Buds start at $179 and are slated to launch in Spring 2020. The headphones include a truly wireless design, as well as \"adaptive sound\" technology, which automatically adjusts the volume depending on the environment you're in.\n\nTodd Haselton | CNBC", "description": "The company is hosting its annual hardware event on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Annie Palmer Todd Haselton", "Annie Palmer", "Todd Haselton"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106182405-1571150972660phones.jpg?v=1571151030", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
