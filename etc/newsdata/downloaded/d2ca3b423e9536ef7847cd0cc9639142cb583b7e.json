I came away from that game feeling like I\u2019d been a Liverpool fan my whole life. Just to know you\u2019re part of that club is incredible,\u201d says Amy Rodgers. \u201cThe dream would be to have a night like that ourself, to have people singing \u2018You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone\u2019 that loud would be amazing.\u201d\n\nAfter that game, Rodgers, a Celtic fan through her Scottish mother, was on a mission to get to Madrid. When herself and Liverpool teammate Niamh Charles got tickets, they headed to the Champions League final wearing their own shirts and mingled among the rest of the Liverpool fans, keeping quite on they fact they play for the club.\n\n\u201cThe experience was unbelievable,\u201d says the 19-year-old. \u201cJust being in Madrid before the game, the amount of fans there, Liverpool shirts everywhere. And you run into random people through the day who you knew. The atmosphere. I was so lucky to get a ticket. It makes you want to get to games that people want to watch and to want to win things as well.\n\nThe impact of England success on women's football \u2013 from top to bottom Read more\n\n\u201cI wore my Rodgers shirt, me and Niamh Charles were there: \u2018Rodgers\u2019 and \u2018Charles\u2019 across our backs and Avon across the front. People kept asking: \u2018Where did you get that shirt?\u2019 I don\u2019t think we told them because we didn\u2019t want to draw attention to ourselves.\u201c\n\nWhile the men\u2019s team is going through a renaissance under J\u00fcrgen Klopp, in the background, the women\u2019s team is gradually embarking on one of its own. Liverpool women have a potted recent history. With Matt Beard at the helm (now West Ham manager) and a push of support from the club, the Merseysiders became the team to topple Arsenal. Not only did they end the Gunners nine consecutive seasons at the top, they won the Women\u2019s Super League back to back.\n\nBut then they slipped away from the pack. An apparent disinterest in the women\u2019s team from the club\u2019s hierarchy ensued \u2013 throwing away the hard work that have driven them to the top. It culminated in an exodus of players at the end of the 2017-18 season and the arrival of Neil Redfearn and then his exit one game into the season because of frustrations with the situation behind the scenes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Liverpool women manager Vicky Jepson gives the final team talk before their game against the Metropolitan All Stars in in Boston, Massachusetts in July 2019.

Travelling with the men\u2019s side on their preseason tour of the US and with revamped dressing rooms, change is seemingly afoot.\n\nAnd Rodgers, who stepped up to the first team in 2017, is excited about the new atmosphere on Merseyside. \u201cA couple of years ago Liverpool were one of the first sides to sort of go professional and they took strides forward like that. Hopefully, this can be another big year for us.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve added depth. Mel Lawley \u2013 she gets the ball, dribbles at you and you can\u2019t get the ball off her. I can\u2019t keep up with her but some of the others can. Mel\u2019s a great attacking threat. And Jade Bailey can pass the ball for days and you can\u2019t get near her because she\u2019ll just pass the ball away, hopefully we can do much better this year.\u201d\n\nIt is also exciting for Rodgers to be working under Jepson, who has nurtured her career. \u201cVicky coached me at Cheshire when I was about 15 and obviously I had her at Liverpool Development and when she became first team manager I was really excited because she puts trust in young players. You want to know that your coach believes in you.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Amy Rodgers of Liverpool slides in to score the third goal in their 3-1 win over Everton Ladies in their WSL match at Prenton Park in May 2019.

Going into year two, she expects the work to increase but it\u2019s important she has options beyond the pitch. \u201cThat\u2019s always been the plan, I\u2019d like to be a psychologist when I finish playing,\u201d she says. \u201cMy dissertation may be linked to sport so maybe I can do mental health in sports. We have a psychologist when we are away with England and the role they play is interesting. I was thinking I want to be a psychologist as well.\u201d\n\nDoes it give her an edge? \u201cThe main thing for me is it that I\u2019m quite understanding of other people, I understand why they interact in a team, the way they do,\u201d she says.\n\nHaving switched from the blue half of Liverpool to red, at youth level, it was when she was at Everton that she first thought she could possibly make a career out of the game. Now she is playing alongside and against players that coached her and she grew up watching.\n\n\u201cWhen I first joined Everton, Fara Williams coached me, which was quite funny. She would join in the session and if she wanted the ball, she\u2019d just push you over and then it would be your fault that you lost the ball. So there was Fara, Jill Scott, Alex Greenwood, Toni Duggan, most of the England were team were at Everton at some point so it was pretty amazing to think I used to go and watch most of them play and think I want to be on the pitch like that one day.\u201d", "description": "The Liverpool women midfielder is looking forward to the new WSL season after following the men\u2019s Champions League run", "authors": ["Suzanne Wrack"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68e01376471468988a4181ac78205dd8d2eff5dc/4_291_3775_2266/master/3775.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6aa026b3378bde7e4a6f23fb452c6077", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
