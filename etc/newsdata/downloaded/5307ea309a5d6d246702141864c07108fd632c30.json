And while, at first, her identity remained a mystery, it's now been confirmed that Liam's blonde ladyfriend is Australian actress, Maddison Brown.\n\nSo, they've got the Australia thing in common, then, at least.\n\n\n\nMaddison plays Kirby Anders on TV show Dynasty, and while she's never even been linked as friends with Liam Hemsworth publicly, it seems like they're getting on pretty well if all that hand-holding is to mean anything.\n\nObviously, since the pictures of Liam and Maddison broke, the internet has gone wild doing deep dives for any morsels of information that can be gathered. Maddison\u2019s Instagram account has been discovered, and subsequently flooded with ~intense~ comments about Liam.\n\n\"How's Liam doing?\" one super cool sleuth wrote on Maddison's latest picture.\n\nBut perhaps the best bit of internet investigation that's emerged since Liam and Maddison's papped date is this: a video in which the actress reveals she would \"f*ck\" Liam Hemsworth (er, and his brother Chris).\n\nWhen asked how she would arrange fellow Australians Hugh Jackman, Margot Robbie and the Hemsworth brothers in a a game of in a game of 'F*uck, marry, kill\", Maddison said this:\n\n\"I\u2019m gonna kill Hugh Jackman, and get that one right off the table. I\u2019m gonna marry Margot Robbie because I would like to f*ck her for life. And then I will f*ck the Hemsworth brothers but at the same time, both of them,\" said Maddison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut wait. If anyone had any high hopes of Liam and Maddison getting serious, she followed it up with this:\n\n\"I couldn\u2019t marry them [the Hemsworths]. I\u2019m too insecure. I would just be like, 'You\u2019re too attractive, you are never allowed to leave the house'.\"\n\nThis video only dates back to June 2019, and oh how things have worked out for her. Let's hope Maddison goes back on that one...\n\nSince their split in August, both Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus have made it very clear they've moved on from one another. After initially dating Brody Jenner's ex-wife Kaitlynn Carter), Miley is now dating musician Cody Simpson (another Australian, interestingly enough) - and they are very much Instagram official, thank you very much.\n\nPhoto credit: Instagram More\n\nWe first heard that Miley and Liam had called time on their relationship back in August.\n\nA source at E! reported that \"they were drifting apart\" and have been \"trying to make it work for months\". The insider claimed it had not happened that recently, adding, \"Miley and Liam have still been communicating and it wasn't a messy split but they have decided they are at different points in their lives currently.\"", "description": "Maddison Brown was spotted holding hands with Miley Cyrus' ex last week.", "authors": ["Catriona Harvey-Jenner"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7IE53UBChPezKYXY9cEtZw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/1ace0d479c579add420fa63df58c0bbc", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
