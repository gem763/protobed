Although we don\u2019t think Sony are going to be held to that.\n\nOf course, trademarks are all about stopping anyone else from using a name, as much as they are about allowing you to use it, but at this point there doesn\u2019t seem any reason to imagine Sony are going to stop calling their consoles PlayStation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is a question though is whether consoles as currently understood will still be relevant in the future. Although streaming won\u2019t be taking over this coming generation it may well have by the time of the PlayStation 6.\n\nThe death of consoles has been predicted a number of times before though, and it\u2019s never happened, so we\u2019ll literally just have to wait and see.\n\nFor now, the PlayStation 5 is planned to release around this time next year, with Sony expected to release more details in the spring.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter", "description": "The PS6 and everything that comes after has already been planned for, as Sony prepares for video games in the year 2055 AD.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jqgsycanfavvbig_1572343420.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
