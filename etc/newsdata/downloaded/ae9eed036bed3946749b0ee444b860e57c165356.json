Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who is in New York for the U.N. meetings, has warned that any retaliatory strike on Iran by the U.S. or Saudi Arabia will result in \u201can all-out war.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Gen. Hossein Salami, at a ceremony displaying pieces of an American drone Iran shot down in June, said that his forces have carried out \u201cwar exercises and are ready for any scenario.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIf anyone crosses our borders, we will hit them.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The U.N., Gulf Arab nations and the U.S. accuse Iran of supplying arms to the Houthis, something Tehran denies.\n\nAnalysts say the missiles used in the Sept. 14 assault wouldn\u2019t have enough range to reach the oil sites in eastern Saudi Arabia from impoverished Yemen. The missiles and drones used resembled Iranian-made weapons, although analysts say more study is needed to definitively link them to Iran.\n\nSalami added that Iran does not want to start a conflict, but appeared to warn the U.S. and Saudi Arabia that Iran is prepared.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t stop until the destruction of any aggressor. And we will not leave any secure spot,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not miscalculate and do not make a mistake.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump signaled on Friday that he was not inclined to authorize an immediate military strike on Iran in response to the attacks on the Saudi oil industry, saying he believes showing restraint \u201cshows far more strength\u201d and he wants to avoid an all-out war.\n\nThe Pentagon said the U.S. will deploy additional troops and military equipment to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to beef up security.\n\nTrump, who withdrew the U.S. from the nuclear deal more than a year ago, said separately Friday that America \u201cjust sanctioned the Iranian national bank.\u201d He did not elaborate.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department said it took action against the Central Bank of Iran.\n\nIran\u2019s central bank chief, Abdolnasser Hemmati, sought to shrug off the new sanctions on Saturday. According to the state-run IRNA news agency, Hemmati said re-imposing sanctions on Iran\u2019s central bank shows the U.S. has little leverage left.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The statement comes as Iran's nuclear deal with world powers collapses and the U.S. alleges Iran was behind the Saudi Arabia oil attacks.", "authors": ["Amir Vahdat"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/saudi-arabia-aramco.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
