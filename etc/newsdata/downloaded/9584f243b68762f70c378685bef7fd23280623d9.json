But a Parliament official said the legislature would soon make clear in writing that the two nominees are not acceptable.\n\nFifteen committee members voted to reject Plumb\u2019s candidacy while six voted in her favor. There were two abstentions. Plumb, a member of the Socialists and Democrats group, was called before the committee to account for two loans worth nearly \u20ac1 million that she did not declare in her original financial declaration scrutinized by MEPs.\n\nThe committee voted against Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi by a margin of 11 against and nine in favor. Two MEPs abstained.\n\nSergey Lagodinsky, the vice president of the committee, told POLITICO: \"The two [nominees] have been rejected while 24 were cleared.\"\n\nLagodinsky said the next step will be to send a letter to von der Leyen, \"underlining our position and deciding what further is going to happen.\n\n\"The process is for now suspended until the Commission president reacts,\" he added.\n\nThe approval of the Legal Affairs Committee is an essential precondition for parliamentary hearings to take place. Without its green light, EU rules state that the confirmation procedure for the commissioner-designate is suspended. The next step is for the Parliament's president to ask von der Leyen how she wishes to proceed.\n\nA Parliament spokesperson said a rejection of a candidate in the Legal Affairs Committee is unprecedented and \"we have to see what will happen.\u201d\n\n\"It\u2019s clear that the hearing can not take place,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nHans von der Burchard contributed reporting.", "description": "Blow to von der Leyen as Parliament panel cites concerns over conflicts of interest.", "authors": ["Anca Gurzu", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "Lili Bayer"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/plumbtrocsanyi-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
