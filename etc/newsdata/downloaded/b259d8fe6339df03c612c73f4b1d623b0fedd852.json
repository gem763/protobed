After all, they had plenty in common.\n\nPeter \u201cPhoebe\u201d Freestone, Freddie\u2019s longtime personal assistant, has reminisced on their friendship, telling Metro.co.uk: \u2018They actually became close friends.\n\n\u2018They then missed seeing each other quite often because both of them, both Queen and Elton were just non-stop touring. And we were rarely in the same city at the same time.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeter worked with Freddie for 12 years and was there by the musician\u2019s side just one day before he passed.\n\nSharing his fond memories, continued: \u2018But every now and then it would happen and they would get together and there would just be no stopping and just talking, talking, talking, talking for hours and hours just to catch up on what has happened since the last Sunday.\n\nFreddie, here with Peter Straker, and Elton (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018Then once he got sick and he was at home a bit more, Elton would come around regularly, maybe every fortnight he would come around and he would sit and talk with Freddie particularly during that last year.\u2019\n\n\u2018[He would] just sit there talking with him, just so that Freddie knew he wasn\u2019t alone, and that really showed the genuine, deep friendship between them.\u2019\n\nElton has previously spoken of how, even in his final days, Freddie went to the effort of buying him a Christmas present.\n\nPeter was actually there when Freddie bought the gift \u2013 a painting from Henry Scott Tuke.\n\nRecalling the experience, Peter said: \u2018During that time, it must have been the last six months, we were at one of the auction rooms and he saw a painting by one of Elton\u2019s favorite painters, and Freddie bought it for him thinking of it as a Christmas present for Elton.\n\n\u2018I mean, not knowing that he was going to die in the November and after Freddie died, I knew what this picture was for Elton and Freddie had wrapped it up in a in a pillow case.\n\nFreddie died after a battle with AIDs in 1991 (Picture: Redferns)\n\n\u2018I remember that, it wasn\u2019t wrapped up in paper it was in a pillow case. It\u2019s what he wanted to do.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElton made sure to spend quality time with Freddie and was a regular visitor at the singer\u2019s Kensington home.\n\n\u2018We all knew that the end was coming. I think it was maybe a week before Elton came. He had to go to Paris to record so he gave us all his numbers to call him should anything happen,\u2019 Peter revealed.\n\n\u2018But it was within a week that Freddie died the last time he visited.\n\n\u2018Press were outside the house 24 hours a day and they would question anybody who came to the front door.\n\n\u2018What Elton used to do, he would drive himself in his mini and park in the mews behind Garden Lodge.\u2019\n\nAccording to Peter: \u2018He would phone ahead and say exactly what time he would be there, we would let him in, he\u2019d go and see Freddie and disappear.\n\n\u2018Nobody knew that Elton was visiting except for that very last time he was driven in one of his Bentley\u2019s to the front door and then people were asking: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? Why are you here? What\u2019s going on?\u201d And he just said I\u2019ve just come see my friend.\u2019\n\nFreddie died on 24 November 1991 at the age of 45 due to complications from AIDs.\n\nEven after the singer had passed, Elton still looked out for those who were closest to the Bohemian Rhapsody legend.\n\nPeter recalled: \u2018Elton came round to the house after Freddie died and ask the three of us \u2013 because of course Jim Hutton was there Joe Fanelli and myself \u2013 and he asked what we were doing for Christmas because Elton knew Freddie always had big Christmases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Freddie would always invite anybody. Any friends who did not have family were invited to Christmas. I remember once having to do Christmas lunch for 25 people.\u2019\n\nThe former assistant continued: \u2018After Freddie died, Elton came and he said, \u201cWhat are you guys doing for Christmas?\u201d He then said, \u201cLook than enough of this. I will send a car on Boxing Day you will come to Windsor and you will have Christmas with us\u201d.\n\n\u2018And we took the present with us just to make sure that Freddie\u2019s wish happened. That Elton got this picture. Elton\u2019s spoken about it, I\u2019ve seen him talk about it before.\n\n\u2018But Freddie, even though he was within months of death would still think of his friends.\u2019\n\nFreddie Mercury\u2019s Never Boring box set is available to buy now.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
