That steep valuation, combined with founder Adam Nuemann\u2019s tight control of the company under the initially proposed governance structure, left the company and its bankers struggling to generate demand from public-market investors, the Journal has reported.\n\nThe company declined to comment.\n\nThe changes to the company\u2019s filing lowered the voting-rights premium afforded to shares held by Neumann from 20-to-1 to 10-1. The company also changed a clause that gave Nuemann\u2019s wife, Rebekah, a key role in choosing his successor as CEO should he die or become disabled in the next decade. Now, the board of directors will choose the next CEO in that event and the filing states that no family members of Nuemann\u2019s will sit on the board of directors.\n\nThe company is now targeting a valuation of $20 billion or less, the Journal has previously reported.\n\nFor context, WeWork\u2019s most direct competitor, IWG (ticker: IWG-L) is almost identical in size, but has a valuation of about $4.5 billion, or around three times revenue. It turns a profit, while WeWork has racked up billions of dollars in losses.\n\nYet WeWork is growing far faster. A $20 billion valuation for We for would represent a little under seven times its current revenue.\n\nWrite to Ben Walsh at ben.walsh@barrons.com", "description": "The We Company made big changes to its governance structure, according to a regulatory filing by the company.", "authors": ["Ben Walsh"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-106932/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
