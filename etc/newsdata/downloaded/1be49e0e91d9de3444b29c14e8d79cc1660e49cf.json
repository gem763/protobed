What a tangled web we weave, indeed,\u201d Avery wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Marisa Ronan, a former academic and managing director of diversity and inclusion consultancy firm Psynapse EU, said she believes the brooch may have been chosen in direct reference to Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar\u2019s recent \u201cAthena jibe\u201d towards Johnson.\n\nDuring a joint press conference conducted with Johnson earlier this month, Varadkar said he wanted to be the \u201cAthena\u201d to Johnson\u2019s \u201cHercules\u201d.\n\n\u201cArachne challenged Athena, goddess of wisdom and crafts, to a weaving contest. Such hubris resulted in her being transformed into a spider,\u201d Dr Ronan tweeted.\n\nSome saw it as a feminist statement, referencing a goddess worshipped in ancient folklore.\n\nNovelist Melissa Harrison explained that following research, she discovered that \u201cin Ancient Egypt, spiders were associated with the goddess Neith in her aspect as spinner and weaver of destiny\u201d.\n\nDue to the popularity of Lady Hale\u2019s arachnid accessory, Uxbridge-based printing company Balcony Shirts announced it had created a \u201cLady Hale spider brooch T-shirt\u201d.\n\nBalcony Shirts stated on the e-commerce site that 30 per cent of the profits made from T-shirt sales will be sent to homeless charity Shelter.\n\nThe T-shirt, which is on sale on ebay for \u00a310, has sold almost 2,000 times.\n\n\u201cIn 15 years of doing this, nothing like this has ever happened to us before,\u201d Balcony Shirts tweeted.\n\n\u201cThank you so much for your orders and love. We\u2019ve raised \u00a34,000 for @Shelter so far. Homelessness in Uxbridge is a growing problem.
