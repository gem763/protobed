Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThirty-four boba machines worth RM4.5 million are now at the centre of an ugly public spat between Taiwanese bubble tea chain Xing Fu Tang and its Malaysian master franchisee, Collab Working Lifestyle.\n\nWithin a week, both companies published lengthy and strongly-worded Facebook posts detailing accusations against each other.\n\nThe first post, published by Xing Fu Tang Taiwan last Monday (Oct 21), accused Collab Working Lifestyle of breaching protocol to earn extra profit and threatened to terminate its contract, saying it was \u201cheartbroken\u201d to have its reputation \u201csmeared\u201d by a \u201cgreedy\u201d partner.\n\nThe Taiwanese brand said sub-franchisees had submitted numerous complaints about Collab Working Lifestyle to the Taiwan HQ, claiming the master-franchisee did not help them set up their outlet, but only provided a few photos and print-outs.\n\nIn addition, it sold bubble tea ingredients to franchisees at a high cost, charged unreasonable shipping fees, and publicly said it did so \u201cbecause it could\u201d. It also lied to sub-franchisees that it would only allocate one outlet per zone, the Facebook post claimed.\n\nXing Fu Tang said the monthly marketing and brand maintenance fees collected by Collab Working Lifestyle should only have been done once a year, adding that these fees far exceeded the sum the Malaysian brand paid for its master franchisee rights to the entire country.\n\nLast, the Taiwanese brand said Collab Working Lifestyle had announced plans to set up its own bubble tea brand with Xing Fu Tang\u2019s Indian franchisee, adding that both master franchisees had failed to meet contractual obligations.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned about the livelihood of our Malaysian sub-franchisees once the new brand is established,\u201d it said.\n\nIn the week the post was published, two Xing Fu Tang outlets in Klang Valley were vandalised with red paint five times.\n\n\u274c Defamation \u274cCompromising We will not bow to thugs \u203c\ufe0fFrom Oct 17 to 26, two Xing Fu Tang stores in Klang Valley\u2026 Posted by Xing Fu Tang Malaysia \u99ac\u4f86\u897f\u4e9e\u5e78\u798f\u5802 on Monday, 28 October 2019\n\n\u201cWe have lodged police reports and submitted the CCTV footage to authorities. We don\u2019t know who did it, but we refuse to bow to thugs,\u201d Xing Fu Tang Malaysia said.\n\n\u201cOur conscience is clear\u201d: Xing Fu Tang Malaysia\n\nDays after the vandalism incidents, Collab Working Lifestyle responded with a Facebook post on the Xing Fu Tang Malaysia page, calling all the accusations \u201cunfounded\u201d and \u201cwild\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur conscience is clear. We have not breached the master franchise agreement,\u201d it said.\n\nIt added that the Taiwan HQ had defamed it because it refused to buy 34 pearl-moulding machines for the \u201csky high price\u201d of RM4.5 million.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f\u3010\ud835\udc17\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc05\ud835\udc2e \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc30\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc2a\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1a \ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc32 \u2026 Posted by Xing Fu Tang Malaysia \u99ac\u4f86\u897f\u4e9e\u5e78\u798f\u5802 on Sunday, 27 October 2019\n\nXing Fu Tang\u2019s principal company, CEO International, asked its Malaysia business to buy the machines \u2013 which make strawberry heart-shaped boba \u2013 on Oct 15, it said in its post.\n\nCEO International then sent an invoice for the machines, and requested payment the following day.\n\nThe machines, however, were due to be delivered between end 2020 and 2021, the post added.\n\nFollowing this, Collab Working Lifestyle and all of Malaysia\u2019s Xing Fu Tang sub-franchisees signed and sent a letter saying that they would not buy the machines.\n\nIn its Facebook post, Collab Working Lifestyle claimed it had previously bought induction cookers for RM40,000 each (which broke in months), and egg cake machines for RM150,000 each (despite having no egg cakes on the menu).\n\nIt added that CEO International often sold them \u201cdrastically inflated\u201d equipment, such as track lights and machines that often broke down.\n\nIt also acknowledged plans to start its own bubble tea brand, but said this was for \u201cbusiness survival\u201d after the Taiwan HQ threatened to terminate its agreement.\n\n\u201cAs Malaysian SMEs, we have invested a lot of resources into the Xing Fu Tang brand, and we will not be bullied,\u201d the post said.\n\nAddressing fans, it added: \u201cXing Fu Tang Malaysia will continue to operate as usual. We will continue to serve you your favourite drinks.\u201d\n\nRead also: Taiwan\u2019s Xing Fu Tang is now in Singapore \u2013 here\u2019s which drinks you must try, and our verdict on their stir-fried pearls", "description": "Business Insider - The Xing Fu Tang dispute has gotten so ugly, some outlets in Malaysia were even vandalised by unknown perpetrators..
