Within minutes, his supporters were framing the impeachment hearings as an unpatriotic attack on a leader keeping America safe.\n\nTrump celebrated the death of Baghdadi, noting he had \u201cdied after running into a dead end tunnel whimpering and crying and screaming\u201d. The Isis leader was a \u201cdog\u201d, a \u201cgutless animal\u201d, and the Isis militants who died alongside him were \u201closers\u201d and \u201cfrightened puppies\u201d.\n\nIt sounded like the dialogue of a triumphant chieftain in a made-for-TV warrior epic, and at one point Trump confirmed he had witnessed it almost as a piece of cinema, \u201cas though you were watching a movie. The technology alone is really great.\u201d\n\nWhile the prepared statement focused on the special forces who had carried out the raid, the president\u2019s impromptu remarks in answer to reporters\u2019 questions, reverted to the Trumpian norm, presenting it as a personal achievement.\n\n\u201cI kept saying where\u2019s Al-Baghdadi,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been looking for him for three years.\u201d Days earlier, Trump had denigrated his former defence secretary, James Mattis, for being \u201coverrated\u201d and \u201cnot tough enough\u201d, and boasted: \u201cI captured Isis. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month.\u201d\n\nThe personality cult that Trump is seeking to construct had already taken on an alarming tone. Over the weekend, his press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, had denounced another former aide turned critic, John Kelly, as \u201ctotally unequipped to handle the genius of our great president\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi is thought to have been born in the central Iraqi city of Samarra in 1971. Though a weak student, whose poor eyesight disqualified him from joining the Iraqi military, he rose to command al-Qaeda\u2019s Iraqi division and then broke away to form Islamic State (Isis).\n\nIn July 2014, shortly after Isis said it had established a caliphate in Iraq and Syria, Baghdadi delivered a sermon from a mosque in the captured Iraqi city of Mosul. Appearing unmasked for the first time, he declared himself to be the caliph: the political and religious leader of the global Muslim community.\n\nHis declaration was roundly rejected by almost all Islamic religious authorities but his caliphate became a magnet for thousands of foreign fighters and women. The group attempted not just to hold territory but to administer it like a state, establishing a brutal justice system, collecting taxes and doling out public services.\n\nBaghdadi had been seen publicly on one other occasion, in an 18-minute video released in April this year. From 2016 he had a $25m bounty on his head.\n\nHe had been reported to have suffered serious injuries in airstrikes over the years, and there had occasionally been speculation that he had been killed, but he continued to resurface in audio tapes and videos. He killed himself in October 2019, while under attack from US forces.\n\nMichael Safi\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was clear within minutes of announcing Baghdadi\u2019s death, that the delusional bubble around the president would now be even harder to puncture. In one particularly bizarre claim for someone known not to use a computer, the president said that Isis \u201cuse the internet better than almost anyone in the world, perhaps other than Donald Trump\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s obsession with his predecessor was also very much at the fore. He left little doubt that Barack Obama\u2019s success in tracking down and killing Osama bin Laden was on his mind. Baghdadi was the greater scalp, he argued. \u201cOsama bin Laden was very big but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center,\u201d Trump declared. \u201cThis is a man who built a whole \u2026 country, a caliphate, and was trying to do it again.\u201d\n\nTrump also repeated a claim that he had somehow had a hand in Bin Laden\u2019s downfall by calling for him to be targeted before the 9/11 attacks, before he was generally perceived as a threat. It is a false claim. Trump mentions Bin Laden in passing in one of his books, does not call for him to be tracked down, and the al-Qaida leader was already widely seen as a substantial threat following several attacks on the US.", "description": "President\u2019s supporters framing the impeachment hearings as an unpatriotic attack on a leader keeping America safe  * Baghdadi\u2019s death comes as new order takes shape in Middle EastDonald Trump makes a statement following reports that US forces attacked and killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi", "authors": ["Julian Borger In Washington"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Enz5bnIMvwang0IoFs40OA--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/33f8a96124317e2babd506c1d850cfd7", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
