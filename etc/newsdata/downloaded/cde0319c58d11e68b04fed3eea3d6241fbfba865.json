But that's not something that depends on me.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"It's down to the coach to make those decisions and really I have to respect that. Right now it's about not giving up.\n\n\"You have to continue working hard and whether I'm playing in the starting XI or from the bench I want to give my all for the team. That's the kind of player I am.\n\n\"I like to give 100 per cent for the shirt to help my team-mates and to give the fans something to cheer about.\"\n\nArsenal boss Emery has hinted recently that there may be more opportunities for Torreira in the coming weeks.\n\n(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)\n\n\"His qualities are that he can give us good pressing, and he can win the ball high up the pitch to give us the possession to score,\" said Emery.\n\n\"He did that [in the 3-0 Europa League win at Eintracht Frankfurt]. After, we need someone with the ball and in his position, he can help us with the build-up.\"", "description": "Torreira hit the ground running when he signed last summer but has found opportunities harder to come by this season", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Pa", "Arsenal Fc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13865277.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brighton-and-Hove-Albion-v-Arsenal-Premier-League-AMEX-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
