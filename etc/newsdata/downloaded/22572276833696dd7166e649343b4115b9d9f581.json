He estimates that in the first half of 2019, hundreds of millions of rands worth of counterfeit goods illegally landed at OR Tambo International Airport alone.\n\nAnd that is not counting smuggling by road from neighbouring countries.\n\nIt is not just fake Rolexes and Gucci bags streaming into South Africa. Counterfeits of the traditional culprits - clothing, shoes, handbags, and jewellery \u2013 are all on sale, but so are fake car parts, medicine, cigarettes, alcoholic drinks, face creams, and even food.\n\nThere is local manufacturing to contend with; secret factories in far-flung places that tirelessly turn out the fakes. In Hartswater in the Northern Cape, police last year uncovered counterfeit production of spices, sanitary towels, and shoe polish worth roughly an estimated R80 million.\n\nSee also: How to spot a fake Rolex\n\nRaiding and shutting down these counterfeiting operations seems to have no observable effect on volumes, but doing nothing is not an option.\n\nEconomically, fakes harm South Africa by impacting the taxable revenues of the real thing, and deterring investment, Lotheringen says.\n\nThey also present safety hazards. In a particularly sinister example, the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority has identified a steady stream of counterfeit antiretroviral drugs for AIDS treatment entering the country since 2006. Counterfeit car parts too put many people at risk.\n\nThe answer, she says, may not be attempts at better enforcement \u2013 as Ramaphosa has promised \u2013 but education of potential buyers.\n\n\u201cConsumers must understand what\u2019s at stake,\u201d she says.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:\n\n<>", "description": "The sheer volume of counterfeit goods imported into South Africa \u2013 or being made right here \u2013 makes law enforcement hard.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9383/7f6232ef8d654cb1a56561ccba3d12c7.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
