True North sought accreditation for journalist Andrew Lawton, who is a fellow with the organization.\n\nLawton said late last month he had been barred from a public Liberal Party event in Thunder Bay, Ont., and had subsequently received an apology from the party.\n\nHe also made headlines last year while running as a Progressive Conservative candidate in Ontario's provincial election.\n\nLawton came under fire then for past comments critics described as misogynistic, racist and homophobic, which he blamed on a years-long struggle with an unspecified mental illness.", "description": "Two right-wing media organizations are turning to the courts after claiming their representatives were denied accreditation to cover tonight's election debate.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5311138.1570389356!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-debate-20190913.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
