I mean, it\u2019s a kind of wild open season.\u201d\n\nAs chief of public diplomacy between 2013 and 2016, Stengel spent much of his time trying to combat propaganda by the so-called Islamic State and Russia, a subject he writes at length about in his new book, \u201cInformation Wars: How We Lost the Global Battle Against Disinformation and What We Can Do About It.\u201d\n\nWhatever gains have been made against the Islamic State, he said, could now be wiped out by an escalation in fighting among the various parties to the conflict. After talking to President Trump, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ordered attacks against Syrian Kurdish fighters to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d on his country\u2019s border with Syria. The Turks view the Syrian Kurds as having links to the PKK, a militant Kurdish group in Turkey that Erdogan views as terrorists. But they have been allied with the U.S. in the fight against ISIS and borne the brunt of the combat, and casualties, for the past five years.\n\n\u201cSo the Turks and the Kurds will sort of go to war,\u201d Stengel said. \u201cThe Russians will come in on the side of the Turks. The Iranians will continue to back Assad. I mean, to me, this is like this just pushed [the war] down the road.\u201d\n\nThe most immediate danger, he said, is that thousands of Islamic State fighters who have been held in makeshift jails by the Kurds will now escape amid the fighting. \u201cAbsolutely, these guys can scurry back \u2026 and start committing terrorist acts in Europe. I mean, it's a really dangerous situation, which is why what Trump did is so reckless.\u201d\n\nPhoto illustration: Yahoo News; photo: AP More\n\nAnother big winner from the Turkish assault is Russian President Vladimir Putin, who, Stengel said, has wanted all along to see more Syrian refugees pouring into Europe.\n\n\u201cOne of the arguments that I make in the book that I don't hear picked up enough is that Putin's indiscriminate bombing in the Syrian war when they went in in 2015 and '16 was deliberate to create more Syrian refugees to go through Turkey into Europe.\u201d\n\nThe Russians \u2014 and their propaganda outlets \u2014 played up bogus stories such as one about a Russian girl allegedly raped by a Syrian refugee in Germany. Even though the story turned out to be false, the Internet Research Agency \u2014 the troll farm in St. Petersburg that was active in manipulating American social media platforms in the 2016 election \u2014 played up the claims, and \u201cthe Russian foreign minister talked about it within 15 minutes,\u201d Stengel said.\n\nPutin \u201cweaponized immigration in Germany \u2026 and that bled over into the U.S.,\u201d he said.\n\nDownload or subscribe on iTunes: \u201cSkullduggery\u201d from Yahoo News\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "A former top State Department official says that President Trump\u2019s green light for a Turkish invasion into northern Syria was a \u201csuper-damaging\u201d and \u201creckless\u201d mistake that could prolong the war there for \u201cprobably two or three decades.\u201d", "authors": ["Michael Isikoff", "Chief Investigative Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/f3ppxEkzQUVrM8__CB5s5A--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/cb9820e0-ec59-11e9-bf77-13dddcfb5f7b", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
