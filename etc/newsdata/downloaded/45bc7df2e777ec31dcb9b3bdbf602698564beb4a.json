(Njeri Mwangi/Reuters)\n\nIt was quiet, not yet 7 a.m., and the students of Precious Talent Top School were in class early to prepare for upcoming national exams. There was neither rain nor high winds \u2014 it was a typically beautiful day in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi.\n\nIn a split second, however, a wing of the private school collapsed into a pile of rubble, trapping sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders \u2014 killing at least seven of them and injuring dozens more, according to city officials.\n\nThe tragedy raises questions about Kenya\u2019s enforcement of building codes for schools and apartment complexes, which are often made by private contractors long accused of cutting corners.\n\n\u201cLook at these wires, the stones that were used,\u201d said Peter Livasia, 30, a parent of an unhurt student. \u201cThe structure may look good, but when the building comes down, you realize it was made of nothing.\u201d\n\n\n\nRescue equipment didn\u2019t arrive at the school for more than an hour after the collapse. Bystanders used their hands to pull away the rubble and sent injured children to nearby hospitals on the back of Nairobi\u2019s ubiquitous motorcycle taxis. There are 917 students at the school.\n\nWhen government officials arrived by midmorning, they were greeted with anger.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they must have checked all these structures,\u201d Moses Nyakiongora, director of the National Building Inspectorate, told reporters at the scene. \u201cBut we have very many unsafe structures in Nairobi.\u201d\n\nHe added that his bureau would conduct an investigation into \u201cwhy these makeshift structures, which are death traps\u201d are not being properly inspected.\n\nTo any contractor who cut corners, Nyakiongora said, \u201cyou are a murderer and a con man.\u201d\n\n\n\nEmergency workers at the site where a school building collapsed in Nairobi on Monday.

Why did he have to put two floors? That was just greed,\u201d said the teacher, as Ndirangu and officials gathered in the school for an emergency meeting. Ndirangu\u2018s lawyer said his client would not be available for comment.\n\nLivasia, the parent, said he paid around $90 per year for his daughter to attend the school, which is above average by Kenyan standards.\n\nThe school, which is in a crowded area, had a reputation in the neighborhood as one where students scored well on exams, and it was drawing more students every year. Livasia didn\u2019t fault Ndirangu for wanting to take on more students but for not ensuring new construction was done carefully.\n\n\u201cI just want to know, the money we pay, where does it go? The greed is killing our children,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nA wing of the Precious Talent Top School collapsed Monday.
