And that is evident not only in the number of plots we have foiled, but also the number of convictions we have achieved and continue to chase through the courts.'\n\nAlso last month official figures revealed that the number of right-wing extremists arrested under anti-terror laws has risen to the highest level on record.\n\nThe latest figures came amid a government consultation on plans for tougher sentences for terrorist offences. Pictured is the aftermath of the London Bridge attack in June 2017\n\nThe total increased to 33 in the year to the end of June, up from 28 in the previous 12 months, ten in 2016-17 and six in 2015/16.\n\nThe rise coincides with another fall in the number of Islamist extremists held by police.\n\nThis total peaked in the 12 months to the end of June 2017, when 185 people with Islamist extremist ideologies were arrested on suspicion of a terror-related offence. It dropped to 178 in 2017/18, and 171 in 2018/2019, according to Home Office figures.\n\nThere were 266 arrests for suspected terrorism-related activity in the past year, down from 354 in the previous 12 months, continuing a downward trend.\n\nOf those arrested in 2018/19, 23 per cent were released without charge \u2013 the lowest percentage since records began after the September 11 terror attacks in 2001.", "description": "Investigators have disrupted 24 terrorist plots in the UK since April 2017, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has said.", "authors": ["Ed Riley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/11/20029806-0-image-a-6_1571739351102.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
