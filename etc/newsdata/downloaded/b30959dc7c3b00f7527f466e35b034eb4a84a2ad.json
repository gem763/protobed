Fifa had no other option but to name her the best women\u2019s player on the planet\n\nBy the time Megan Rapinoe stood in Stade de Lyon after July\u2019s World Cup final, arms outstretched like a statue one might find at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, it was obvious she had arrived at an apex few of us can ever hope to reach. The heart of a World Cup-winning USA team that will go down as the greatest ever, Rapinoe was the worthy recipient of Fifa\u2019s The Best award on Monday in the women\u2019s player category.\n\nBut a few years ago, it was almost inconceivable that Rapinoe would be standing under the bright lights, hailed as a hero. It appeared Rapinoe\u2019s career was winding down and her best days were behind her \u2013 struggles that, in retrospect, propelled her to the stage at Fifa\u2019s awards gala.\n\nThere was the disappointment of the 2016 Olympics, of course, where Rapinoe\u2019s US team were knocked out in the quarter-finals \u2013 the earliest exit for the Americans in any major tournament. Rapinoe made her return during the Rio Games after 252 days without playing competitive football and, in her rushed return from an ACL injury, she failed to make the impact coach Jill Ellis had hoped for.\n\nMegan Rapinoe calls out racism and homophobia in Fifa acceptance speech Read more\n\nThere were also the off-field diversions. Rapinoe joined Colin Kaepernick\u2019s protest against racial injustice by kneeling during the national anthem for both club and US team games. In response, the US Soccer Federation passed a new bylaw stating that any player who didn\u2019t stand for the anthem would face punishment, something that threatened her place on the team.\n\nAll the while, Ellis vowed to upend her roster before the 2019 World Cup and veteran players soon found themselves out in the cold. Call-ups and starts that used to belong to Rapinoe had gone to young up-and-comers such has Mallory Pugh, a winger 13 years Rapinoe\u2019s junior.\n\nIt was a year that Rapinoe later admitted was a difficult one but she insisted it also rejuvenated her. On the pitch, she was resurgent, fitter and stronger than ever. Away from the game, she became more committed to speaking out, even if it meant being labeled as a \u201ccontroversial\u201d athlete.\n\n\u201cIt really only solidifies who I am as a person and the things that I stand for,\u201d she said in 2017. \u201cOften times you stand up [for something] and people clap, and sometimes you do and they don\u2019t. It only strengthened my resolve and my ethos of standing up for what I believe in.\u201d\n\nHer comeback from one of the most tumultuous years in her career laid the groundwork for her eventual breakout in 2019. At this summer\u2019s World Cup, Donald Trump tweeted criticism of Rapinoe, chastising her for not respecting \u201cour Country \u2026 or our Flag\u201d after she had said she did not want to visit the White House. Rapinoe promptly scored twice in her next game, a marquee match-up between the US and France. For good measure, Rapinoe scored again in the World Cup final, which the US won, and left with a literal armful of trophies. Criticize her at your peril.\n\nEdward Hardy (@EdwardTHardy) Donald Trump: \"Megan should win first before she talks\"\n\n\n\nMegan Rapinoe: pic.twitter.com/0P9RXzxPeW\n\nRapinoe, to be sure, is a dazzling player to watch. A crafty and audacious winger, her enthusiasm is spellbinding \u2013 she plays like she\u2019s having the time of her life, even when it seems like everyone wants to bring her down. She\u2019ll dribble a defender into circles, find a seam for a pass out of nowhere, or score an impossible curler and make it look routine. But her sensational 2019 was buoyed by something more than that \u2013 something beyond what she could do with the ball at her feet. Her authenticity and self-belief set her apart in the most rigorous edition of the Women\u2019s World Cup ever played.\n\nMegan Rapinoe: 'We're everything Trump loves \u2013 except that we're powerful women' Read more\n\nShe used routine press conferences to talk about the inequities in women\u2019s football and, even as a Fifa media officer sat close by, she didn\u2019t hold back in her criticism of football\u2019s governing body. Fifa hadn\u2019t shown it cared about the women\u2019s game and offered lip service but not enough resources, she calmly argued.\n\nRapinoe and her teammates have sued the US Soccer Federation over allegations of gender discrimination, and she didn\u2019t demur as the topic came up in France. By the time she and her teammates lifted the World Cup trophy, the crowd in Lyon erupted into a rousing chant: \u201cEqual pay! Equal pay!\u201d If the USA\u2019s biggest star in the tournament had been someone else \u2013 someone less inclined to speak so openly about inequality \u2013 it\u2019s worth wondering if that chant would have happened.\n\nIt was only fitting that on the night she was being honored as Fifa\u2019s top player of the year, she again made the platform bigger than herself, calling on everyone to combat racism, sexism and other ugly elements of football.\n\n\u201cI ask everyone here: lend your platform to other people,\u201d she told the crowd in Milan. \u201cLift other people up. Share your success. We have a unique opportunity in football, different to any other sport in the world, to use this beautiful game to actually change the world for better. That\u2019s my charge to everyone. I hope you take that to heart and just do something. Do anything.\u201d\n\nHow to define the word \u201cbest\u201d may vary depending who you ask, and it becomes all the more complicated when trying to untangle a player\u2019s individual success in a team sport. But if \u201cbest\u201d can be defined as the player who made the greatest impact with the most poise at the highest level, there is little doubt that Rapinoe was the best 2019 had to offer.\n\nHer performance has been transcendent, not just within the white lines on the grass, but at podiums and in front of crowds. Awarding the top individual honor to any other player simply wasn\u2019t an option.", "description": "The World Cup champion has been transcendent, on and off the field.
