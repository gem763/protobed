They are the first structural shifts as part of Boeing's response to the ongoing crisis over the grounding of its 737 Max after deadly crashes killed 346 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia.\n\nThe board's review is just one of numerous probes into the development of the 737 Max by global regulators and US lawmakers and the Department of Justice. Boeing also faces more than 100 lawsuits by victims' families alleging it designed a flawed airplane.\n\nThe changes will be rolled out over the next couple of months, pending further review, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters in August.\n\nThey are intended to boost the transparency and oversight of engineering decisions and accelerate efforts to share safety information as widely and swiftly as possible across Boeing's global businesses and factories.\n\nThe board of directors approved a new Aerospace Safety Committee at its August 2019 meeting, it said on Wednesday.\n\nRead more: The Boeing 737 Max has had a troubled existence that culminated in 2 fatal crashes just 5 months apart. Here is the complete timeline of the besieged jetliner, from its birth to the present day.\n\nThe six recommendations following the special panel's review include the creation of a new Product and Services Safety organization that reviews all aspects of product safety and investigates cases of undue pressure and anonymous employee concerns.\n\nThe board also recommended that all Boeing engineers, including the new Product and Services Safety organization, report directly to the chief engineer, who reports directly to Muilenburg.\n\nBoeing should also work with airlines to \"re-examine assumptions around flight deck design and operation\" and recommend pilot training criteria beyond traditional training programs \"where warranted\", it said.\n\n\"Design assumptions have evolved over time, and the company should ensure flight deck designs continue to anticipate the needs of the changing demographics and future pilot populations,\" the board said.", "description": "Boeing's board said it would create a new permanent safety committee, and reorganize engineering reporting lines to improve oversight.", "authors": ["Eric M.
