And that starts at check-in.\n\n\n\n\"I think that the check-in process can be a lot better and simpler [than it is in most hotels,]\" Kjellgren said.\n\n\"Everything should be done before you get there. You already provided a credit card and everything.\"\n\nAs far as Kjellgren is concerned, check-in takes an unnecessarily long time - he believes you should simply hand over your passport and get your keys in return.\n\n\"Everything is prepared,\" he said. \"They know who's coming because you've already provided all of the information.\n\n\"It's the first impression that you get [of a hotel], and it's all about how you're approached when you get there.\"", "description": "First impressions count, and Philippe Kjellgren explained to Insider why a hotel's check-in experience says a lot about the establishment.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7885/c53922be31f140ddbe75d4daf19bcd45.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
