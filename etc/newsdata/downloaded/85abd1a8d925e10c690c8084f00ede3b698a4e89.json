Truman Building, headquarters for the State Department, in Washington in 2009. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has put up a wall against State Department employees being deposed in the House\u2019s nascent impeachment inquiry of President Trump. But on Wednesday, one key State Department employee is headed to Capitol Hill to share \u2026 something.\n\nExactly what that is, we don\u2019t know. What we do know is State Department Inspector General Steve Linick has requested an \u201curgent\u201d briefing \u201cto discuss and provide staff with copies of documents related to the State Department and Ukraine.\u201d\n\nGiven the apparent potential of that information, it\u2019s worth a look at Linick\u2019s history.\n\nThat history, as it happens, includes very recently calling out the alleged politicization of at least one area of the State Department. As The Post\u2019s Karen DeYoung reported in August:\n\nA report by the State Department\u2019s inspector general concludes that leadership of a leading department bureau mistreated and harassed staffers, accused them of political disloyalty to the Trump administration, and retaliated against them. In response to repeated counseling by more senior State officials that he address staff concerns, the report concluded, Kevin Moley, assistant secretary for international affairs, \u201cdid not take significant action.\u201d The report, released Thursday, is a sweeping condemnation of Moley and more specifically of his former senior adviser, Mari Stull. A former lobbyist and consultant for international food and agriculture interests, Stull left the department in January following press reports that, among other things, she had compiled a list of staffers deemed insufficiently loyal to the Trump administration. ... Stull, it said, referred to some employees as \u201cObama holdovers,\u201d \u201ctraitors,\u201d or \u201cdisloyal,\u201d and accused some of being part of the \u201cDeep State\u201d and the \u201cswamp\u201d \u2014 terms that President Trump has used to refer to federal employees. All of those so accused, the report said, were career staffers and not political appointees. Some staffers said Moley accused them of \u201cundermining the President\u2019s agenda,\u201d the report said.\n\nLinick is one of relatively few remaining holdovers from the Obama administration \u2014 a fact that will probably lead to accusations of political bias if he produces information that is damaging to the administration. But by law, inspectors general are required to be politically independent.\n\nLinick is also a former nominee of the George W. Bush administration and top official in the Bush Justice Department. After serving as an assistant U.S. attorney in the 1990s and early 2000s, he took on key Justice Department roles that included rooting out contract fraud in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n\nBush nominated him to be the first inspector general for the Federal Housing Finance Authority in 2008. Bush left office before he could be confirmed, but Barack Obama renominated him and he was confirmed in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, the Wall Street Journal profiled Linick, under a subheadline that declared his \u201cAggressive Stance Chafes Mortgage-Finance Firms\u2019 Regulator.\u201d The profile described Linick pressing harder and expanding his scope more than many were comfortable with:\n\nThe FHFA says Mr. Linick\u2019s jurisdiction should be confined to the regulator [FHFA], while Mr. Linick says his mandate includes Fannie and Freddie, justifying the growth of the year-old watchdog. \u201cWe are in a unique situation here\u201d because \u201cthe regulator has become one in the same with the regulated entities to some extent,\u201d he said. Mr. Linick, a 48-year-old former assistant U.S. attorney and top Justice Department official, says his approach is needed to protect taxpayers. \"Our job is to provide transparency and lift the veil on how things are working,\" he said in an interview. To management at Fannie, Freddie and the FHFA, Mr. Linick has become an overbearing presence who is diverting attention away from business operations, according to current and former employees. One growing concern within the companies is that the FHFA now filters major decisions through the prism of how the inspector general might criticize them, these people say. \"This inspector general seems to have decided his job is to go in and second-guess everybody's decision, and to do that it has to know everything they knew,\" said David Felt, a senior lawyer at the FHFA until his retirement last year. \"It creates a very chilling atmosphere.\" \u201cWe try to be very fair,\u201d Mr. Linick said. \u201cI understand why in the face of tough questions that people would be uncomfortable, but that\u2019s our role.\u201d\n\nLinick was confirmed as State Department inspector general in 2013. He was nominated for the job amid controversy over the Obama administration\u2019s failure to install someone permanent to the post. That particular inspector general slot had been vacant since 2007, with an acting official serving in between. That led to condemnation from the Government Accountability Office and concerns of inadequate internal oversight of the State Department. Republicans argued that the vacancy led to lax oversight, particularly when it came to the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.\n\nLinick opened a review of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server in April 2015 and was generally viewed as being aggressive in that probe. He also teamed with the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general in an unusual arrangement.\n\nIn August of that year, The Post\u2019s John Hudson \u2014 then writing for Foreign Policy \u2014 profiled him as one of \u201cthe Obama Appointees Who Could Sink Hillary.\u201d Hudson spoke with a number of officials who described Linick as a potent force with bipartisan sources:\n\nCongressional aides describe Linick as intent on cultivating relationships with Republicans \u2014 and say he has been unusually successful in doing so. In negotiations with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the former federal prosecutor specifically sought legislation to provide his office with additional independence from Foggy Bottom, a request Republicans were happy to grant in the committee\u2019s State Department authorization bill, which aimed to give the inspector general more autonomy in conducting investigations. \u201cHe has built good relationships on both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill,\u201d a former committee staffer told Foreign Policy. Linick has also surprised observers inside and outside Foggy Bottom with his willingness to publicly criticize the State Department for security lapses exposed by the Benghazi attacks in 2012, and the mismanagement of billions of dollars of reconstruction money in Iraq and Afghanistan. John Sopko, the U.S. watchdog for Afghan reconstruction, called Linick \u201ca breath of fresh air\u201d at the State Department. \u201cSteve brings that view that he is supposed to be independent and he\u2019s supposed to speak truth to power,\u201d he said.\n\nThat reputation, in particular, would seem to portend potential trouble for a Trump administration rife with officials speaking out anonymously against what\u2019s occurring.", "description": "He's an Obama appointee with a history of calling out overly political machinations in President Trump's State Department.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/76DXaOP60tiaLed_nOq6sA0FlG0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/X6IFC46L2RHFLHZDZIKWWBHR5Y.jpg"}
