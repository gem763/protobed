The small property appeared to be ringed by a fence and largely obscured by trees.\n\nDutch media reported that the family was made up of five adult siblings and their father.\n\nDe Groot told reporters the siblings were aged from 18-25. He said their mother is believed to have died \"a number of years ago.\"\n\nLocal police said in a tweet that officers visited the farm after being alerted by somebody \"concerned about the living conditions\" of its residents.\n\nPolice said they arrested a 58-year-old man who rented the property, but it wasn't immediately clear why or what his relationship was to the family. Police said he wasn't the father.\n\nPolice investigating the farm found \"a number of improvised rooms where a family lived a withdrawn life,\" De Groot said in a statement.\n\nLocal bar owner Chris Westerbeek told broadcaster RTV Drenthe that he called police after a man \"with a confused look in his eyes,\" with unkempt hair, a long beard and old clothes walked in to his bar and ordered five beers for himself.\n\n\"He said where he came from, that he'd run away and that he needed help urgently,\" Westerbeek said.\n\nDe Groot said the police investigation is looking into \"all possible scenarios,\" but didn't elaborate.\n\nHe said the family was now \"in a safe place receiving appropriate care and attention.\"", "description": "Dutch authorities were Tuesday trying to piece together the story of a family found living isolated from the outside world in the rural east of the Netherlands.
