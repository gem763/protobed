In July, the South Korean tech giant said that the problems with the device\u2019s innovative folding screen were resolved.\n\n\u201cDuring the past several months, Samsung has been refining the Galaxy Fold to ensure it delivers the best possible experience,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cNot only we improved the Galaxy Fold\u2019s design and construction, but also took the time to rethink the entire consumer journey.\u201d\n\nIn their announcement, the company said the nearly $2,000 phone will launch on Sept. 6 in South Korea followed by select countries including the U.S. and more, adding, \"with a 5G-ready option in select countries, consumers will be able to unfold the future on the fastest network speeds available.\"\n\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u201cThe category-defining Galaxy Fold is a device that defies the barriers of traditional smartphone design.

The delay was a setback for Samsung and for the broader smartphone market, which had been looking to folding screens as one way to catalyze innovation in the industry.\n\nThe Galaxy Fold is slightly longer and narrower than a standard smartphone when folded, but opens up to the size of a small tablet, with the internal screen display bisected by a crease. It also has another screen on the outside so it can be used when closed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Samsung highly-anticipated folding phone is set to hit stores following a troubled past.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/02/0/0/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold-4.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
