British travellers who wish to visit the European Union must have a passport with a minimum of six months\u2019 validity.\n\nCrucially, no passport is regarded as valid beyond 10 years after the date of issue. For nearly two decades until September 2018, UK adult passport holders who were renewing their travel documents were granted up to nine months\u2019 credit for unexpired time. So a passport issued on 30 April 2010 could show an expiry date of 30 January 2021.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

If the UK is given \u201cPart 2 listed status\u201d, there would be some extra requirements for travelling pets and owners post-Brexit. \u201cThese would require an additional visit to the vet and some additional papers to be carried but would not prevent you from enjoying your trip,\u201d says Eurotunnel. But it adds that if the UK is given unlisted, third-country status, \u201cowners who wish to travel with their pets from the UK to EU nations will need to discuss their specific preparations and requirements with an Official Veterinarian at least four months prior to their desired travel date AFP/Getty 3/14 Eurotunnel/Eurostar The Treaty of Canterbury between the UK and France governs the Channel Tunnel link and operations will continue \u2013 subject to any local disruption at Folkestone and/or Calais AFP/Getty 4/14 Driving Motorists, whether taking their own cars or hiring abroad, are likely to need to obtain an International Driving Permit or two; different EU countries are signed up to different treaties, so for a trip embracing Spain and France you would need both types.

However, in the event of the UK leaving with no deal, many flights are likely to be cancelled because departures would be capped at 2018 levels.

That means there must be at least 90 days (roughly three months) left on your passport beyond your intended date of departure. Because third-country nationals can remain in the Schengen area for 90 days, the actual check carried out could be that the passport has at least six months\u2019 validity remaining on the date of arrival Getty 9/14 Online registration prior to travel \u2013 ETIAS From 2021, non-EU nationals who do not require a visa to enter the Schengen area \u2013 including British travellers \u2013 will need to request prior authorisation to visit Schengen countries.

This would impinge on holidaymakers\u2019 plans PA 13/14 European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) The EU says: \u201cIf you fall ill or have an accident during a visit to another EU country, as an EU citizen you have the right to receive the necessary public healthcare in any EU country under the same conditions as people in the host country.\u201d The EHIC also works in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Treatment, says the NHS, is \u201cat a reduced cost or, in many cases, free of charge\u201d.

But Dave Dyson, chef executive of Three, says his firm is \u201ccommitted to maintain the availability of roaming in the EU at no additional cost following Brexit\u201d AFP/Getty\n\nBut once Britain leaves the EU, it will be regarded by Schengen countries as expiring on 30 April 2020. So someone hoping to travel to one of these nations on 1 November 2019 would be ineligible, according to the UK government \u2013 even though their passport shows an expiry date almost 15 months ahead.\n\nYou can check whether your passport will be regarded as \u201cSchengen compliant\u201d at the government\u2019s online service to assess your travel document.\n\nChildren\u2019s passports were issued for a maximum of five years and nine months and therefore do not conflict with the EU\u2019s 10-year maximum.\n\nIf you are abroad on 31 October with a passport that ceases to be valid it is extremely unlikely the authorities will pursue you or cause any problem when you come to leave, so long as you do not stay for months.\n\nThere is no clarity about when new blue passports will be available. They were due to become standard from this autumn.\n\nThese rules do not apply to travel to Ireland. The government says: \u201cYou can continue to use your passport as long as it\u2019s valid for the length of your stay.\u201d This is false; under the Common Travel Area passports are not required, though some airlines specify that they must be produced for identification.\n\nVisas\n\nBritish travellers will not need them for visits to Europe of up to 90 days in every 180 days \u2013 in other words, you can spend two stretches of three months in the EU each year, but they have to be at least three months apart. This will have an effect on people who like to spend the winter in Spain.\n\nBy 2021 UK citizens will need to apply in advance for an Etias, the \u201cEuro-visa\u201d that non-EU citizens from favoured countries must obtain.\n\nThe European Travel Information and Authorisation System is aimed at reducing the \u201cmigration, security or public-health risk\u201d from nationals of visa-exempt third countries, which is what the UK will become after Brexit. It will cost \u20ac7 for three years \u2013 though many websites will inevitably seek to prey on travellers and charge many times more.\n\nMedical treatment\n\nThe government recommends: \u201cYou should always get appropriate travel insurance with healthcare cover before you go abroad.\u201d\n\nBut many travellers rationally use the European Health Insurance Card (Ehic) as a substitute for insurance. From midnight on 31 October, in the event of no-deal, these will cease to be valid.\n\nThe government says: \u201cIt\u2019s particularly important you get travel insurance with the right cover if you have a pre-existing medical condition. This is because the Ehic scheme covers pre-existing conditions, while many travel insurance policies do not.\u201d\n\nThe Association of British Insurers (ABI) says: \u201cFor many travel policies in the market, the loss of the Ehic is unlikely to lead to a meaningful change to terms and conditions; any reference to the Ehic would simply be irrelevant and customers would still be able to make medical claims.\u201d\n\nThe organisation insurers warns: \u201cBe aware that there is a small number of policies in the market that state they will only provide cover if you have and use an Ehic. Customers in this position should check their policy and contact their insurer.\u201d\n\nMobile phones\n\nAt present UK travellers benefit from free roaming across the European Union. The government says: \u201cAfter Brexit, the guarantee of free mobile phone roaming throughout the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway will end.\n\n\u201cCheck with your phone operator to find out about any roaming charges you might get after 31 October 2019.\u201d\n\nUsers are protected from mobile data charges above \u00a345. \u201cOnce you reach \u00a345, you need to opt in to spend more so that you can continue using the internet while you\u2019re abroad. Your phone operator will tell how you can do this,\u201d says the government.\n\nSome mobile phone firms, notably Three, have said they will not reintroduce charges.\n\nMotoring\n\nDrivers will need an International Driving Permit (IDP), an antiquated document available at larger post offices. Take your driving licence, a passport photo and \u00a35.50. You may need more than one; a 1949 IDP covers Spain, Cyprus and Malta, while a 1968 version is valid everywhere else in the EU.\n\nMotor insurance will no longer automatically extend to the EU. Insurers will provide on request a \u201cGreen Card\u201d, for which an extra charge will be made. The government says: \u201cAllow one month to get this from your vehicle insurance company.\u201d\n\nPets\n\nTo take a dog, cat or ferret abroad on 1 November, you should have contacted your vet on 1 July to begin the process, because it is not clear what veterinary rules the European Union will apply.\n\nThe government says: \u201cTo make sure your pet is able to travel from the UK to the EU after EU Exit in any scenario, you should contact your vet at least four months before travelling.\u201d\n\nLong-term effects on travel\n\nIt is not clear whether the \u201copen skies\u201d agreement will extend to Britain after Brexit, which may reduce choice and increase costs.\n\nThe UK is likely to receive significantly fewer European Union visitors as a result of the government\u2019s insistence that tourists from the EU must have a full passport rather than an ID card. It is estimated that 100 million EU citizens have ID cards but not passports.\n\nIf this happens, it will reduce the transport links to and from Europe that would prevail had the status quo continued.", "description": "By the end of this month, says the government, the United Kingdom will have left the European Union.
