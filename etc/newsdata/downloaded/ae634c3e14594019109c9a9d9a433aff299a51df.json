She had not been expecting him to initiate sexual contact. \u201cHe always treated me like a little sister,\u201d Nevils told Farrow in the book, a copy of which has been obtained by The Washington Post. \u201cI had been to his room many times.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs Radford noted on \u201cToday,\u201d Nevils was at the center of the 2017 complaint that prompted Lauer\u2019s abrupt firing. At the time, NBC News said Lauer had been fired for \u201cinappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace,\u201d and promised to keep Nevils\u2019s identity anonymous at her request. More women came forward to accuse Lauer of misconduct \u2014 including allegations that he once gave a colleague a sex toy as a gift and that he had exposed his penis to another female colleague.\n\nGuthrie and Kotb were emotional as they addressed the report Wednesday. \u201cI feel like we owe it to our viewers to pause for a moment. This is shocking and appalling and I honestly don\u2019t know what to say about it,\u201d Guthrie said, sounding on the verge of tears. \u201cI know it wasn\u2019t easy for our colleague Brooke to come forward then \u2014 it\u2019s not easy now \u2014 and we support her and any women who come forward with claims.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just very painful for all of us who are at NBC and at the \u2018Today\u2019 show,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very, very difficult.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs Kotb acknowledged, the moment was strikingly similar to the 2017 \u201cToday\u201d episode that found the pair announcing Lauer\u2019s firing to the world.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at you and I\u2019m having a weird moment, that we were sitting here just like this two years ago,\u201d Kotb told Guthrie. She then turned her attention to viewers, noting that she and Guthrie had prayed ahead of Wednesday\u2019s broadcast.\n\n\u201cYou feel like you\u2019ve known someone for 12 years,\u201d Kotb said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if you guys have ever felt like that \u2014 you know someone \u2026 you feel like you know them inside and out, and then all the sudden, you feel like a door opens up and it\u2019s a part of them you didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAnd we don\u2019t know all the facts in all of this, but there are not allegations of an affair,\u201d she added. \u201cThere are allegations of a crime.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFarrow also makes this point in his book, writing in 2017 that \u201cNBC leadership and the press had deemed\u201d her story \u201ca consensual affair.\u201d\n\nLauer cast their relationship as such in a letter provided to Variety on Wednesday through his lawyer. In the lengthy statement, Lauer emphatically denies the allegation, which he said is \u201ccategorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense.\u201d\n\nLauer begins his letter by addressing his decision to not speak out against what he called \u201csome of the false and salacious allegations leveled at me.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAfter concluding that his \u201csilence was a mistake,\u201d Lauer writes: \u201cToday, nearly two years after I was fired by NBC, old stories are being recycled, titillating details are being added, and a dangerous and defamatory new allegation is being made. All are being spread as part of a promotional effort to sell a book. It\u2019s outrageous. So, after not speaking out to protect my children, it is now with their full support I say \u2018enough.\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLauer repeatedly refers to his relationship with Nevils as an \u201caffair,\u201d and notes that \u201cit showed terrible judgment on my part, but it was completely mutual and consensual.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cToday,\u201d Radford noted that Lauer was fired a day after Nevils and her lawyer met with NBC\u2019s human resources department. According to Farrow\u2019s book, Nevils went to HR at the suggestion of Meredith Vieira, the longtime \u201cToday\u201d journalist she had worked for in Sochi.\n\nAD\n\nFarrow writes that Nevils \u201cleft out nothing\u201d in her discussion with HR reps \u2014 including subsequent encounters with Lauer, such as the time he allegedly requested oral sex in return for contributing to a goodbye video Nevils made for her ex-boyfriend, another NBC colleague.\n\nFarrow\u2019s book also notes that Nevils and Lauer had sexual encounters in the former \u201cToday\u201d host\u2019s Upper East Side apartment and in his office, and that \u201csources close to Lauer emphasized that she sometimes initiated contact.\"\n\nAD\n\nBut Farrow writes that Nevils \u201clived in terror of Lauer jeopardizing her career and that the encounters caused anguish and shame.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was completely transactional,\u201d Nevils told Farrow of her continued encounters with Lauer. \u201cIt was not a relationship.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe author describes a devastating fallout for Nevils, who felt betrayed by the network\u2019s management as Lauer\u2019s alleged misconduct was presented as infidelity. And while her identity was hidden from the public, it was not necessarily so at work. NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack cited the Sochi Olympics in his statement about Lauer\u2019s firing, Farrow notes, \u201cnarrowing the potential complainants to a small group of women on that trip with close proximity to Lauer.\"\n\nNevils threatened to sue NBC after the Comcast-owned network \u201coffered her one year\u2019s salary to depart and sign a nondisclosure agreement,\u201d Farrow writes. She eventually agreed to a seven-figure settlement in exchange for not talking about the matter publicly because, as Farrow writes, she felt she \u201cdidn\u2019t have a choice\u201d because of \u201cthe damage she felt the network had done to her reputation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNevils later agreed to share her story with Farrow because of his bombshell reporting on decades of alleged predatory behavior by influential Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. (\u201cI saw myself in those stories,\u201d Nevils told the author. \u201cAnd when you see the worst part of your life in the pages of The New Yorker, it changes your life.\u201d) Farrow\u2019s work \u2014 along with explosive reports by the New York Times \u2014 was central to the 2017 reckoning against Weinstein and other powerful men.\n\nAD\n\nThose reports revealed a culture of complicity that, according to Farrow, pervaded NBC\u2019s top ranks, where Lauer\u2019s alleged misconduct was reportedly an open secret. Farrow, a former investigative correspondent for NBC News, had initially been reporting on Weinstein for the network. But, the author contends, NBC ultimately killed the story because of pressure from Weinstein himself.\n\nWeinstein, whose efforts to intimidate and silence both his accusers and journalists have been well-documented in Farrow\u2019s work, had caught wind of Farrow\u2019s reporting and began a pattern of reaching out to top NBC executives \u2014 including Lack, NBC News President Noah Oppenheim and MSNBC President Phil Griffin. According to Farrow, Weinstein\u2019s strategy involved American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer; the tabloid had obtained reports of other alleged misconduct by Lauer, which Weinstein threatened to expose in repeated conversations with NBC execs.\n\nAD\n\nNBC told the Hollywood Reporter in a statement Wednesday that \u201cNBC News was never contacted by AMI, or made aware in any way of any threats from them, or from anyone else, for that matter.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAnd the idea of NBC News taking a threat seriously from a tabloid company about Matt Lauer is especially preposterous, since they already covered him with great regularity,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nOn \u201cToday,\u201d NBC News addressed Nevils\u2019s allegation Wednesday with a terse on-air statement: \u201cMatt Lauer\u2019s conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time. That\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint.\"", "description": "\"Today\" show anchors confronted the news live on TV Wednesday.", "authors": ["Bethonie Butler", "Reporter Covering Television", "Pop Culture"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7fPfnwRRsYfHLqqxkzS54-PIvoM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/54P6AFDK3EI6RIZVYRID2BA6V4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
