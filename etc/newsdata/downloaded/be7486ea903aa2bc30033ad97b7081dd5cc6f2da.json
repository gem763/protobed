The show chronicled how a grandmother manages to get into comedic predicaments while living with her daughter\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018I Love Lucy\u2019 legacy allowed \u2018Life with Lucy\u2019 to happen, but it was a terrible burden,\u201d Ball\u2019s former publicist, Thomas Watson, told Closer Weekly in the magazine\u2019s latest issue, currently on newsstands.\n\n\u2018BUCK ROGERS\u2019 STAR ERIN GRAY SAYS SHE WAS INITIALLY \u2018SCARED TO DEATH\u2019 OF PLAYING COL. WILMA DEERING\n\n\u201cThe show was written by the same people that worked on the original \u2018I Love Lucy,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201cThey were still writing for that Lucy, instead of a \u2018Golden Girls\u2019 kind of character or grandma.\u201d\n\nAccording to the outlet, the star was optimistic about her latest project. However, she wasn\u2019t prepared for the negative reviews \u201cLife with Lucy\u201d received soon after it premiered.\n\nEDIE ADAMS\u2019 SON EXPLAINS WHY HER LATE HUSBAND ERNIE KOVACS IS SEEMINGLY FORGOTTEN IN HOLLYWOOD\n\n\u201cThey were so bloody,\u201d recalled Ann Dusenberry, who played Ball\u2019s daughter in the series. \u201cSo bad and disrespectful. I was hurt for her. They showed no regard that she was an icon.\u201d\n\n\u201cLife with Lucy\u201d was supposed to run for 22 episodes. However, ABC pulled the plug after eight.\n\n\u201cIt was so sad and disappointing,\u201d admitted Watson.\n\nBRUCE CAMPBELL SAYS IT FEELS GOOD TO RETIRE AS ASH FROM \u2018EVIL DEAD\u2019: \u2018GET OUT BEFORE IT\u2019S TIME FOR THE WALKER\u2019\n\nCloser Weekly said Ball\u2019s pal Michael Stern noticed she was devastated by the news.\n\n\u201cAfter an hour, I walked out with her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe started bawling.\u201d\n\n\u201cLife with Lucy\u201d was Ball\u2019s last credited role before she passed away in 1989 at age 77 from an aortic dissection. However, Ball was offered numerous roles well into the last three years of her life.\n\n\u2018LEAVE IT TO BEAVER\u2019 STAR TONY DOW EXPLAINS WHY HE WASN\u2019T ALLOWED TO WATCH HIT SERIES GROWING UP\n\nThe one role Ball did cherish during her final years was that of grandmother.\n\nIn May of this year, the late star\u2019s granddaughter Kate Luckinbill-Conner told Closer Weekly she had fond memories growing up with the queen of comedy.\n\n\u201cMy grandmother was a regular girl from upstate New York,\u201d the star's granddaughter told the magazine.\n\n\u2018LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE\u2019 ACTRESS WENDI LOU LEE SAYS SHE RELIED ON GOD TO HELP HER FACE BRAIN TUMOR\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t set out to be anyone\u2019s icon,\u201d shared Luckinbill-Conner, who described the actress as \u201ca really good grandma\u201d when she was growing up.\n\n\u201cI remember her giving me these incredible bubble baths,\u201d she recalled. \u201cShe loved to wrap me up in towels and do my hair and makeup. She\u2019d dress me in these silk pajamas and let me take a nap on her California king-size bed \u2014 it was just the most expansive, largest thing I\u2019d ever seen in my life!\u201d\n\nLuckinbill-Conner, who at the time was due to give birth to Ball\u2019s first great-grandchild, admitted she wishes the beloved comedienne was still around to meet her new baby. She insisted Ball would have given her firstborn the same amount of love and attention she did.\n\n\u201cShe would make a whole adventure happen for me,\u201d said Luckinbill-Conner. \u201cDid I want to go out and swim? Did I want to play in the playhouse outside? Did I want to eat? It felt like my world and she was just living in it.\u201d\n\n'LAND OF THE LOST' STAR KATHY COLEMAN RECALLS GETTING INTO TROUBLE ON SET, REVEALS WHY HIT SHOW CAME TO AN END\n\nLuckinbill-Conner insisted having Ball as a grandma was one of the best experiences she has ever had. She shared that even as a child, Ball shared no-nonsense life lessons on what it meant to be a successful woman.\n\n\u201cShe wanted to be a mom, and she wanted to be a wife,\u201d she said. \u201cShe also wanted to be an actress and a comedian, and she was determined to do it all. She was humble and she was a real person who just didn\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d\n\nLuckinbill-Conner isn\u2019t the only one to have such fond memories of the \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d icon.\n\nWatson, also told the outlet that one of his favorite memories was simply witnessing the love she had for her co-star and ex-husband, Desi Arnaz.\n\n\u2018BRADY BUNCH\u2019 STAR MAUREEN MCCORMICK REVEALS SPECIAL WAY SHE\u2019S HONORING TV DAD ROBERT REED\n\nBall and Arnaz\u2019s on-screen collaboration ended with their divorce in 1960. The former couple spent 20 years together and welcomed two children: Lucie Arnaz, 67, and Desi Arnaz Jr., 66. The Cuban entertainer died in 1986.\n\n\u201cThey were the best thing for each other and the worst thing for each other,\u201d said Watson. \u201cThey could push all the wrong buttons and all the right ones. It\u2019s just, they were better off apart at the end. For whatever reason, the first marriage didn\u2019t work out. [But] she didn\u2019t throw him away. They became good friends because they had kids in common.\u201d\n\nFORMER \u2018BATTLESTAR GALACTICA\u2019 STAR KATEE SACKOFF EXPLAINS WHY SHE WAITED A DECADE TO TAKE ON SCI-FI AGAIN\n\nAfter the couple called it quits, Ball found love again with second husband Gary Morton. The pair tied the knot in 1961. Arnaz also remarried to Edith Mack Hirsch in 1963. And while the romantic relationship with Ball and Arnaz was over, their close bond and admiration endured until Arnaz\u2019s passing at age 69 from lung cancer.\n\n\u201cThat to me, is a real lesson in life,\u201d said Watson about Ball and Arnaz\u2019s relationship over the years. \u201cBecause a lot of times, when people get divorced or break up, they don\u2019t ever want to see that person again, and they fight for years. They sort of forget that they once meant the world to each other. I can\u2019t say that the day after the divorce they were that way. But after a cooling-off period that was relatively short, they went on with their lives as friends.\u201d\n\n\u2018MARY TYLER MOORE\u2019 STAR ED ASNER SAYS CAST WAS LIKE A FAMILY: \u2018WE FORGAVE EACH OTHER\u2019S FAULTS\u2019\n\nWatson added that Ball and Arnaz were just like \u201csteak and ice cream,\u201d or two different meals you can love at the same time.\n\n\u201cThey recognized the fact, 'OK, this is where we need to be now,'\u201d he said. \u201cBut they never lost their affection for each other, ever.\u201d", "description": "In her later years, Lucille Ball was still eager to pursue her passion to make audiences laugh \u2014 but she was faced with some challenges along the way.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/08/01/694940094001_5816670035001_5816662907001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
