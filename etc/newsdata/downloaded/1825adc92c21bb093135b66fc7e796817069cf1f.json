Left unchecked, the herd could reach 1,500 in several years, severely damaging the landscape and water resources, the park says.\n\nThe reduction plan has been hampered by weather and disagreements over how to kill some of the bison if shipping them off isn\u2019t enough. The Grand Canyon tried to round up some animals last year, but wintry weather set in and the bison headed farther north on a plateau.\n\nThe park is taking a second run at capturing this month.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting a little late start,\u201d said Jan Balsom, a senior adviser at the park.\n\nThe Grand Canyon bison are descendants of those introduced to northern Arizona in the early 1900s as part of a ranching operation to crossbreed them with cattle. The state of Arizona now owns them and has an annual draw for tags on the neighboring Kaibab National Forest.\n\nThe National Park Service released a plan in September 2017 that called for a mix of corralling the animals near the highway that leads to the Grand Canyon\u2019s North Rim, and for skilled volunteers to shoot a certain number of bison inside and outside the park.\n\nIt has made no significant progress on guidelines for lethal options.\n\nThe Park Service fenced off watering holes on the North Rim to try to force the bison into the national forest, where they legally can be hunted. But it didn\u2019t keep the bison out.\n\nThe 25 hunters who drew tags in a state hunt earlier this year came up nearly empty-handed, bagging just two animals. The Arizona Game and Fish Commission recently amended the spring hunts for 2020 and 2021 to give hunters more time overall to kill bison.\n\nMeanwhile, the animals\u2019 population is growing.\n\nThe park hopes to corral dozens of the animals at the North Rim, where the bison breed exclusively after hunting pressure forced them out of the forest about a decade ago. It uses thumb-size pellets to lure the bison into eight-foot-high corrals that can hold up to 100 animals.\n\nBalsom said the park plans to sort animals that are captured in September and give them to Native American tribes across the United States that request them through the Intertribal Buffalo Council. The agreement with the Park Service says none of the animals can be slaughtered within the first year, she said.\n\nThe goal is to reduce the bison herd to 200 within five years, Balsom said.\n\nThe lethal option is contentious. A recording on a Grand Canyon hotline for information on the bison has said for more than a year that the park is still developing plans to allow skilled volunteers to legally kill the animals.\n\nThe state wildlife commission ordered the Arizona Game and Fish Department to cut off talks with the Park Service in January 2018 because it prefers hunters do the work and keep their prey, regional Game and Fish Supervisor Scott Poppenberger said.\n\n\u201cThat would be a substantial game-changer in moving the ball forward,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s a conflict that has played out in other national parks where hunting is banned.\n\nIn Montana, former governor Brian Schweitzer and state legislators over the years have urged Yellowstone National Park to allow bison hunting to keep a rare but contagious bacterial infection in check. The idea was met with stiff resistance from park administrators and has gone nowhere.\n\nUnder a 2001 agreement between federal and state officials, thousands of bison attempting to migrate to winter feeding grounds outside Yellowstone have been captured and sent to slaughter. Others are killed by state-licensed hunters or Native Americans who hold treaty rights to harvest the animals.\n\nThe hunts have stirred controversy, with bison often shot immediately after stepping beyond the park boundary. They have also failed to significantly reduce Yellowstone\u2019s herds, which had roughly 4,500 animals at last count.", "description": "Officials fear population could wreck havoc on the landscape as it continues to grow.", "authors": ["Felicia Fonseca", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png"}
