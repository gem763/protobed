In addition, clear and timely communication will remain essential for effective forward guidance,\u201d it said in a staff report.\n\nThe IMF said Hungary Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u2019s objective to balance the budget over the medium term would help create fiscal leeway, which could be used in the event of any future economic downturn.\n\n\u201cSuch consolidation would reverse the procyclical fiscal stance of the past few years and allow monetary policy to remain accommodative for a longer period, helping preserve Hungary\u2019s competitiveness,\u201d it said.\n\nHungary aims to balance its budget by 2023, according to its latest euro convergence program.\n\nThe IMF said its own forecasts implied a somewhat higher deficit path for Hungary, recommending cuts in tax exemptions and reductions in the public wage bill among other ways to help meet fiscal targets.", "description": "The National Bank of Hungary's continued accommodative monetary stance remains appropriate given a recent decline in inflation and uncertain global economic growth conditions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
