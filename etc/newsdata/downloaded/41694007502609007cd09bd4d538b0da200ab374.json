Liberal groups opposed the nomination vigorously, with the Alliance for Justice labeling her a \u201cslash-and-burn deregulator.\u201d Another judge on the panel, Gregory Katsas, was deputy White House counsel early in the Trump administration. The third judge, Patricia Millett, named to the court by President Barack Obama, is a veteran of the solicitor general\u2019s office in the Justice Department.\n\nWhen I told colleagues that I planned to write in praise of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s postal rate decision, some reacted with alarm. Didn\u2019t I realize that this seemingly benign, even faintly amusing decision might just be a stalking horse for the big project of taking down the administrative state? That a court injecting itself into whether a stamp should cost 5 cents more, or 4, or 3 would, its appetite whetted, quickly move on to intervene in things that really matter?\n\nWell, yes, that much is true. But it\u2019s also true that a court acts as a guardian of democracy when it insists that executive branch actors give reasons that make sense for what they do. The Administrative Procedure Act, enacted in 1946, is the most important federal law that most people have never heard of. It\u2019s a complex statute, but at its heart is a simple premise: that we the governed are entitled to something more than \u201cbecause we say so\u201d \u2014 whether the speaker is the Postal Regulatory Commission, the secretary of Homeland Security or the culture warriors within the Department of Health and Human Services who are carrying out their personal agenda of destroying the infrastructure by which government subsidizes birth control and reproductive health care for poor women.\n\nThe Administrative Procedure Act was the basis for injunctions issued this year by three Federal District Courts blocking the Trump administration\u2019s reinterpretation of Title X to bar counseling on or referrals for abortion by health clinics that receive federal money. \u201cAn agency which changes its position must give a reasoned explanation for the change,\u201d Federal District Judge Edward Chen wrote in one of those opinions. His 78-page opinion shredded the administration\u2019s case for the new rule. For example, Judge Chen\u2019s response to the administration\u2019s assertion that \u201cmore patients could have access to services because of changes to the program\u201d was blunt: \u201cNo explanation is offered for this conclusion, nor any analysis to support it.\u201d An 11-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit heard the administration\u2019s appeal this week.", "description": "There has to be a reason for official decisions beyond \u201cbecause we say so.\u201d", "authors": ["Linda Greenhouse"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/opinion/26Greenhouse/26Greenhouse-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
