Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., announced Thursday that she would not seek re-election in 2020.\n\nAfter all, rumors of Clinton, 39, being groomed for New York's 17th Congressional District, have long been circulating.\n\nThe district represents Rockland County and part of Westchester County, including Chappaqua, where her parents, former president Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, live.\n\nIn an interview with The Journal News/lohud.com last year, Chelsea Clinton said she would consider a political run under certain circumstances.\n\n\u201cI think if someone were to step down or retire and I thought I could do a good job and it matched my talents, I\u2019d have to think if it\u2019s the right choice for me,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile she didn\u2019t have any immediate plans to run for office, she told the paper, it was something she thought about.\n\n\u201cIf you care about what\u2019s happening in the world, you have to care about running for and holding elected office,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope it\u2019s a question that we ask ourselves.\u201d\n\nChelsea Clinton More\n\nChelsea Clinton's spokeswoman did not respond to an email this week about her plans, but whether she'll run is a question many are asking.\n\nOn Twitter, PopularismUpdates posted a side-by-side photo of Chelsea and Hillary Clinton (who recently caused a Twitter storm of her own with her \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me\u201d response to President Donald Trump tweet urging her to run) tweeting: \u201cToday Nita Lowey the Democratic representative for NY 17th Congressional District announced she is retiring. Chelsea Clinton has been speculated to run for this seat. America, it's not too late. Come 2020 we could have them BOTH in office at the same time.\u201d\n\nToday Nita Lowey the Democratic representative for NY 17th Congressional District announced she is retiring.

The Clintons bought the neighboring 3,600-square-foot home at 33 Old House Lane for $1.16 million in August 2016.\n\nReferring to reports it would be used as a getaway home for the couple's daughter and her family, Roni Jacobson, who has lived on Old House Lane since 1984, said when the Clintons bought the house: \"It's a perfect house for (their daughter) Chelsea. Perfect mother-daughter situation. The neighbors are delighted for them.\"\n\n'She can do whatever she wants'\n\nWhat does Lowey, the first woman to lead the powerful House Appropriations Committee, think about a possible Clinton run?\n\n\"She can do whatever she wants. She\u2019s an adult,\" said Lowey in an interview with The Journal News/lohud last November. \"When I decide to retire, I am sure the list will be very long (of people interested in the seat).\u201d", "description": "\u201cIf you care about what\u2019s happening in the world, you have to care about running for and holding elected office,\u201d Chelsea Clinton said last year.", "authors": ["Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy", "Rockland Westchester Journal News"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hEcIm0YuFXomRJ_4MFRd1A--~B/aD03Njg7dz01MTE7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/f24d1ea9a1f279fd07f35c39f231e022", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
