Though it was a record fine under the 1998 law, some lawmakers on Capitol Hill slammed the FTC for failing to impose a harsher penalty on a company with a revenue of $136.8 billion in 2018 alone.\n\n\"Recent events create concern that the FTC is at risk of favoring the interests of giant tech companies over the interests of parents and children,\" the senators wrote on Friday. \"We agree that the Rule warrants updating, but we are concerned that the FTC is choosing to update the rule at a time when the Commission appears insufficiently appreciative of the threat some giant tech companies pose to children and parents.\"\n\nThe FTC has asked the public to respond to a series of questions about COPPA and how it has been enforced, including its \"application to the educational technology sector\" and \"to voice-enabled connected devices.\"\n\nUnder COPPA, which went into effect about 20 years ago, websites must obtain parental consent before collecting data on children under 13.\n\n\"Your agency\u2019s obligation is to put consumers\u2019 interests first and enforce the law,\" the senators wrote. \"Therefore, should the FTC move forward with this review and new rule making, we strongly urge you to exercise sound regulatory judgement and to pursue only those changes that prioritize children\u2019s privacy and well-being.\"\n\nThe FTC will hold a workshop on COPPA on Monday.\n\nIn March, Markey and Hawley introduced legislation to update COPPA that would address loopholes brought on by the digital era. \"COPPA 2.0,\" as the senators have dubbed the bill, would prevent internet companies from targeting ads to children and require the companies to provide more insight into how they collect and use children's data.\n\nMarkey has reintroduced versions of the bill since 2011, but some have speculated it could have legs this session amid heightened concerns about tech companies sucking up vast amounts of data on all users, including children.", "description": "A bipartisan group of senators on Friday sent a letter\u00a0urging the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to avoid weakening the country's children's online privacy rules as the agency works to\u00a0update them.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/federal_trade_commission_ftc_-71968930.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
