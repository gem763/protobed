I don't want to leave any troops there. That's very dangerous territory,\" Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting. \"I don't think it's necessary other than we secure the oil. It's a little different section, but we need to secure the oil.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump also continued defending his decision to withdraw, saying \"we never agreed to protect the Kurds.\"\n\n\"We supported them for 3 1/2, four years. We never agreed to protect the Kurds for the rest of their lives,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"Where's an agreement that said we have to stay in the Middle East for the rest of humanity, for the rest of civilization to protect the Kurds? It never said that.\"\n\nEarlier: The New York Times reported Sunday that Trump was leaning toward a plan to keep about 200 U.S. troops in east Syria to prevent ISIS, Syria and Russia from accessing the oil fields in the area.\n\nThat would be in addition to the 150-or-so troops administration officials have said would stay at the al-Tanf garrison in south-central Syria.\n\nAsked about plans to station troops near oilfields, Defense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperTrump urges GOP to fight for him Overnight Defense: Trump weighs leaving some troops in Syria to 'secure the oil' | US has pulled 2,000 troops from Afghanistan | Pelosi leads delegation to Afghanistan, Jordan Trump says Israel, Jordan asked US to leave troops in Syria MORE told reporters traveling with him in Afghanistan that \"there has been a discussion about possibly doing it.\"\n\n\"There has been no decision with regard to numbers or anything like that,\" Esper said, adding that the option to leave troops by oilfields had not yet been presented to Trump.\n\nOnto Iraq: Over the weekend, Esper confirmed that the troops leaving Syria would be moving to western Iraq.\n\nEsper didn't rule out the possibility of conducting counterterrorism missions in Syria from Iraq, but said those details would be worked out over time.\n\nDespite Esper's Sunday comments, in a tweet Monday, he only said that the United States would \"temporarily reposition\" troops leaving Syria \"in the region outside Syria until they return home.\"\n\nMilitary action against Turkey?: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoDiplomat who raised Ukraine concerns to testify in Trump impeachment probe Overnight Defense: Trump weighs leaving some troops in Syria to 'secure the oil' | US has pulled 2,000 troops from Afghanistan | Pelosi leads delegation to Afghanistan, Jordan Mulvaney faces uncertain future after public gaffes MORE said Monday that Trump \"is fully prepared\" to use military force against Turkey should it be \"needed.\"\n\n\"Where we see American interests at stake or fundamental norms around the world that need to be enforced, we'll use all the powers that we have,\" Pompeo told CNBC's Wilfred Frost on \"Closing Bell.\"\n\n\"We prefer peace to war. But in the event that kinetic action or military action is needed, you should know that President Trump is fully prepared to undertake that action.\"\n\nPompeo would not say what would warrant a military response to Ankara, but noted that \"we've done it before,\" when the Trump administration struck Syria government facilities in 2017 and 2018 after the regime of President Bashar Assad used chemical weapons against civilians.\n\n\"We did it, and the world should know that we will continue to do that,\" Pompeo said before adding that the administration would prefer to use economic or diplomatic means instead.\n\nHe added that did not want to \"get out in front of the president's decision about whether to take the awesome undertaking of using America's military might.\"\n\nIn Congress: There will be a slew of activity in Congress this week on Syria.\n\nSpecial envoy James Jeffrey is scheduled to testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday, followed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday morning and a Senate Appropriation Committee subpanel chaired by Sen.

We consider the intrusion as a military aggression and a violation of international law,\" Engel said in the joint statement with his counterparts in the European legislative branches.\n\n\"We deeply regret the decision of the president of United States to withdraw American troops from northeastern Syria which marks another landmark in the change of American foreign policy in the Near and Middle East,\" the statement added. \"The turmoil caused by the Turkish offensive may contribute to a resurgence of Islamic terrorism and undermines years of effort and investment to bring stability and peace in this part of the world. Therefore, we hope the United States will take up its responsibility in Syria again.\"\n\nEngel has previously condemned Trump's withdrawal and Turkey's invasion, authoring a House-passed resolution opposing the moves and a bill that would impose sanctions on Turkey. But releasing a joint statement with foreign counterparts is unusual for a House member.\n\nMEANWHILE, IN AFGHANISTAN: Even as the uproar over Trump's withdrawal from Syria continues, the U.S. military has been quietly drawing down in Afghanistan, the top U.S. general there confirmed Monday.\n\nGen. Scott Miller, the commander of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, told reporters that about 2,000 U.S. troops have left over the past year, bringing the total to about 12,000.\n\nThe draw down comes despite the fact that peace talks with the Taliban, on which U.S. officials have said the troop presence is contingent, have stalled.\n\nMiller described the reduction as a way to \"optimize the force,\" while Esper said a negotiated settlement is still the \"best path\" to end the war.\n\n\"Until that is accomplished we will continue to pursue an aggressive military campaign against the Taliban and terrorist groups that continue to conduct violence against the people of Afghanistan,\" Esper said.\n\nPelosi makes unannounced trip: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiOvernight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Partnership for America's Health Care Future \u2014 Four companies reach 0M settlement in opioid lawsuit | Deal opens door to larger settlements | House panel to consider vaping tax | Drug pricing markup tomorrow Schiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails Trump urges GOP to fight for him MORE (D-Calif.) was also in Afghanistan on a previously unannounced trip at the same time as Esper.\n\nSuch trips are usually not announced beforehand for security reasons.\n\nPelosi led a congressional delegation to meet with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, Esper, top U.S. military commanders and diplomats, senior Afghan government officials and civil society leaders, her office said in a statement Sunday.\n\n\"Meeting with and hearing directly from our troops and diplomats on the ground is essential for Congress to conduct effective oversight of our mission in Afghanistan,\" Pelosi said in a statement. We will return to Washington strengthened with the facts and the first-hand knowledge we have gathered at this critical time for our nation's Afghanistan policy and inspired by the courage of our servicemembers and diplomats on the front lines.\"\n\nThe group's trip also took them to Jordan the day before. There, they discussed Trump's Syria withdrawal, Pelosi said.\n\n\"With the deepening crisis in Syria after Turkey's incursion, our delegation has engaged in vital discussions about the impact to regional stability, increased flow of refugees, and the dangerous opening that has been provided to ISIS, Iran and Russia,\" she said in a statement.\n\nThe delegation included Engel, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson Bennie Gordon ThompsonOvernight Defense: Trump weighs leaving some troops in Syria to 'secure the oil' | US has pulled 2,000 troops from Afghanistan | Pelosi leads delegation to Afghanistan, Jordan Pelosi, delegation make unannounced trip to Afghanistan US ban on China tech giant faces uncertainty a month out MORE (D-Miss.), House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffSchiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails Trump urges GOP to fight for him House rejects GOP measure censuring Schiff MORE (D-Calif.) and Rep.
