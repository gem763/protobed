The panel makes decisions by vote.\n\nStill, those states ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party may be willing to support a GST cut if the federal government pushes such a proposal.\n\n\u201cIn my view, if the centre feels that it is good for the economy, and they will be able to compensate the states, then the states should support the proposal,\u201d said Himanta Biswa Sarma, the finance minister of the northeastern state of Assam.\n\nThe GST meeting will be closely watched as it could help investors gauge the government\u2019s seriousness in reviving growth in Asia\u2019s third-largest economy.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has in recent weeks outlined a slew of measures to revive investor sentiment and push growth up from a 25-quarter low of 5% in April-June.\n\nBut measures such as creating a stressed fund for the hard-hit housing sector, a withdrawal of higher taxes on foreign portfolio investors and planned mergers among state-owned banks have not really helped revive investor sentiment.\n\nWeak growth has also hit the federal government\u2019s direct tax collections, which are showing a 6% growth rate, considerably less than the budgeted 17% growth rate for this fiscal year, while GST collections in August fell to a six-month low.\n\nThis, in turn, could make it challenging for the government to meet its fiscal deficit target of 3.3% for 2019/20.", "description": "India's goods and services tax (GST) panel is unlikely to approve lowering the tax for the auto and allied components sector this week, as a study has warned of major revenue losses, two government officials said.", "authors": ["Aftab Ahmed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430810204&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0SI", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
