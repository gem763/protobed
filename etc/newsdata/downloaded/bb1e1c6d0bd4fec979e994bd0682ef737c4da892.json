The freedom to say stupid things is the freedom of an open society.\u201d\n\nFacebook and other giant technology companies are facing increasing scrutiny in Europe and the U.S. for the volume of personal data they have collected on users of their services. Regulators and governments have focused on social media\u2019s vulnerability to manipulation and as platforms for the dissemination of fake news, hate speech and fomenting violence.\n\nClegg said that Facebook delivered more than was asked of it by the European Commission during this year\u2019s European Union elections, working with each of the national electoral councils.\n\nThe company has also come under the cosh for its plan to launch a cryptocurrency known as Libra. Clegg said perceptions that this is a Facebook currency are inaccurate, since control will be distributed equally among its founding members. Some of those have been wavering on the project, with PayPal Holdings Inc. on Friday announcing its decision to pull out. Clegg said Facebook would accept any decision made by regulators about Libra\u2019s viability.", "description": "Facebook has made mistakes in controlling the use of its data and has improved its monitoring of fake news but can\u2019t be expected to police the global internet, spokesman Nick Clegg said in an interview in El Pais.", "authors": ["Charlie Devereux"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6661/f3f25d636daf4463823702c6cba45a34.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
