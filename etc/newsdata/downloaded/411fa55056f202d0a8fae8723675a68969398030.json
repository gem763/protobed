The White House took steps in April to try and control its rodent problem (though it wasn\u2019t able to control jokes about said problem).\n\nAnd, of course, Alexander\u2019s encounter with a rodent inspired even more cheesy comments from Twitter users:\n\nYou're at the White House, I'm surprised it wasn't a rat trying to flee the ship. \u2014 AMERICAN MOM #ProudlyDisloyalToTrump \ud83d\udc51 (@GOPAmericanMom) October 1, 2019\n\nBig Mac boxes make fabulous rodent nests.
