The U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. It is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own territory. THE USA IS GREAT!'\n\nTurkish politician Do\u011fu Perin\u00e7ek, chairman of the left-wing nationalist Patriotic Party, responded to Trump's incendiary statements by tweeting #MahvolursunTrump.\n\n'Mr. Trump you can destroy only USA,' he wrote, followed by the hashtag.\n\nThe Turkish word 'mahvolursun' translates to 'thou perish'.\n\nNearly 6,000 people have tweeted the hashtag in the 24 hours after Perin\u00e7ek's post, calling Trump a 'snake', a 'monster' and 'the world's greatest terrorist'.\n\n'How & why have we gotten to a point a president feels he has the power & freedom to basically try to bully and threatening OTHER nations so publicly? We have know the US and other big heads have always done it but like this? On [Twitter]?' one person wrote.\n\n'Go home yankee,' another tweeted.\n\nIt is unclear how long the hashtag was trending before Twitter removed it from the Top Trends list.\n\nTwitter rules state that the platform will prevent content from trending for a small number of reasons, including if it threatens violence against an individual or a group of people.\n\nNearly 6,000 people have tweeted the hashtag in the 24 hours after Perin\u00e7ek's post, calling Trump a 'snake', a 'monster' and 'the world's greatest terrorist'\n\nThe regime of Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad claimed Monday through state-run media that Turkey had already begun launching aerial attacks across the border as unconfirmed reports of airstrikes blanketed Twitter, largely traceable back to unverified amateur video.\n\nTurkish officials reportedly denied launching attacks.\n\nTrump defended his decision to withdraw troops by stating that Turkey is a key trade partner and valuable NATO ally.\n\nThe president effectively washed his hands of the Syrian military quagmire, saying any resurgence of the ISIS terror army would no longer be America's immediate concern.\n\nCountries in what he said is 'not a friendly neighborhood' will have to make do without the United States, Trump said after signing a trade agreement at the White House.\n\n'Iran is an example. Hates ISIS, and ISIS hates Iran. Iraq, you know all about that. Turkey. Syria,' he said.\n\n'Let them take care of it. Let them take care of it. We want to bring our troops back home.'", "description": "'#MahvolursunTrump' - which means 'thou perish Trump' in Turkish, began trending on Twitter in Turkey on Monday after US President Donald Trump tweeted a threat toward the nation.", "authors": ["Megan Sheets For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/16/19448342-0-image-a-49_1570548291969.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
