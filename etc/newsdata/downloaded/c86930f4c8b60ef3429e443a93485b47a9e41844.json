Now, the Sony X900F is a little more accessible, thanks to the fact that it has received a $300 discount from Best Buy.\n\nAs you would expect from a TV in this price range, you'll get a 4K resolution and support for HDR, ensuring that you'll get the best image possible. The TV also comes with the Sony 4K HDR X1 Extreme Processor, which can optimize SDR and HD content to look great on the TV. This particular model has a 65-inch screen, which is more than big enough for even larger living rooms.\n\nThanks to the processor and the quality of the display panel, the TV offers super deep black-levels, and bright, vivid colors. Reviewers note that the TV offers a natural image second only to higher-end OLED TVs that cost a ton more.\n\nThe Sony X900F is pretty smart too. The TV comes with Android TV built in, which allows you to easily install your favorite streaming apps and services, and you can also download some games to pass the time in between bingeing sessions. Android TV works with Google Cast too, which makes it easy to stream content from your phone or computer onto the big screen.", "description": "The Sony X900F TV has some of the best image quality you can find, but it also boasts great smart TV features.
