As such, this will require a little forward planning if you\u2019re to quench your thirst.\n\nFor best results we found using filtered water really made a difference to the finished brew, allowing the nuanced flavours of the ground beans to shine through. You should find that cold brew is a lot smoother and less acidic than an iced coffee but as we\u2019ve mentioned, it will take much longer to prepare.\n\nThankfully though, these appliances take a lot of the hard work out of the preparation for you without using electricity or batteries. And there\u2019s no need to let the timeframe put you off, you can simply leave overnight and wake up to the perfect cold brew.\n\nWhen considering which cold brew maker is best for you, there are two main things to consider. Firstly assess how much room you have for this new kitchen contraption.\n\nSome styles below fit neatly into a fridge door while others will require countertop space \u2013 both will need freshly ground coffee though.\n\nSecondly, think about how many cups you\u2019d like to get out of your machine, below we\u2019ve included a selection of personal bottles that can be enjoyed on the go, as well as larger capacities to quench the thirst of a couple for the whole working week.\n\nMost have reusable parts that only need cleaning, while some others will require replacement parts once the original stash has been depleted.\n\nA handy tool to have during the summer months, one of these machines would also make a lovely gift for the coffee addict in your life.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

The compact design has a built-in filter for infusing your coffee and a secure rubber lid which kept our coffee fresh. Hario recommends pouring cold water over ground coffee, giving it all a little shake and leaving in the fridge for at least eight hours. The clever design means you can leave the filter in while you pour without any sediment getting into your drink. It\u2019s available in just the two colours \u2013 a lighter brown colour as well as mocha. Super easy to use, this is a great value, no-fuss option.\n\nBuy now\n\nSoulhand cold drip coffee machine: \u00a332.99, Amazon\n\nDespite containing multiple parts this transparent glass machine was surprisingly easy to set up. You start by pouring a few scoops of ground coffee into the filter cup and covering that with one of the paper filters provided. Cold water and ice cubes are then added to a chamber that sits on top and very slowly drips through to the coffee below. You can adjust the speed of this, which will slightly impact the intensity of the finished coffee, but expect about seven to eight drips per 10 seconds on average. Making up to 300ml of coffee, we were very impressed with the purity of flavour and with a lifetime guarantee, this feels very good value. The kit comes with 50 paper filters to get you going but these will need replacing when you run out. A benefit of using this method is you don\u2019t need to find space in the fridge, however, it will take up kitchen counter space instead.\n\nBuy now\n\nBodum bean set cold brew coffee maker: \u00a345.30, Bodum\n\nWhile this might look remarkably like your ordinary French press, there are a few marked differences to ensure your cold-brew is up to scratch \u2013 namely an extra silicone lid. Simply add ground coffee to the carafe but instead of using hot water, you\u2019ll need to use cold. Resist the urge to plunge at this point as the maker needs to be placed in the fridge overnight with the silicone lid securely fitted to keep the contents fresh. In the morning, swap the lids, plunge away and your cold-brew will be ready to enjoy. Super easy to use, all the parts can be popped into the dishwasher after use too.\n\nBuy now\n\nKitchenAid artisan cold brew coffee maker 5KCM4212SX: \u00a3129, KitchenAid\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky enough to already own a KitchenAid appliance, you\u2019ll know they are built to last. This cold brew coffee maker is no exception, made from a combination of thick glass and stainless steel that keeps your liquid fresh for up to two weeks. As such, it is quite heavy when full, but the handle makes it easy enough to manoeuvre. We placed ours on a shelf in our fridge (it won\u2019t fit in the door) and poured directly into our glass with the tap, without any leakages. To make the cold-brew you\u2019ll need to add freshly ground coffee into the reusable stainless steel steeper, fill with cold filtered water and leave in the fridge for a minimum of 12 hours (although we think 24 hours is preferable if you want a stronger flavoured brew). Easy to use and clean, the result was super smooth coffee but this contraption can also be used to make iced tea.\n\nBuy now\n\nKilner cold brew coffee set: \u00a316.95, Silver Mushroom\n\nKilner is a brand you\u2019ll no doubt know and trust thanks to its sturdy glassware. Using the same embossed preserve style clip-top jar, this kit is specifically designed to make cold brew, coming with a few important extras. Firstly, the reusable stainless steel coffee filter and four muslin coffee squares \u2013 which can be washed and reused \u2013 ensure none of the ground coffee makes its way into the finished brew. To keep everything in place, the kit comes with 2m of twine (which made us feel very crafty but was a little fiddly) and the 2l clip-top jar itself where you\u2019ll make your batch. Once ready (after at least 12 hours) you can serve in the two smaller handled jars provided. There\u2019s also a recipe booklet to get you started.\n\nBuy now\n\nFull Circle Brumi cold brew bottle: \u00a336.50, Trouva\n\nIf you don\u2019t feel like committing to cold brew for the rest of your days, you might find this versatile bottle from Brumi a good option instead. It\u2019s capable of making both hot and cold coffee (and even tea). The twist-lock lid felt secure and the double insulated glass means your hands never get too cold (or hot). Similar to the Hario version above, it contains a removable filter that you\u2019ll fill with your ground coffee before leaving to infuse overnight, ready to grab and go in the morning.\n\nBuy now\n\nOXO Good Grips cold brew coffee maker: \u00a345, Amazon\n\nOXO is another well-trusted name in the world of everyday kitchen appliances and we found this sturdy piece of kit made a consistently good cold brew. We don\u2019t think it looks quite as modern as the Soulhand one above but it follows a similar format, minus the addition of ice, which some may find more straightforward. The coffee grounds are added to the container, while their poetically named \u201crainmaker\u201d ensures an even distribution of cold water across the coffee. There\u2019s a simple lever that allows the liquid to be released into the glass carafe, which has a spout and measurements for easy pouring. Again, you can also make iced tea in the same way.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: cold-brew coffee makers\n\nWhile we were impressed with all the machines we tried, we think the Hario\u2019s cold brew coffee filter bottle is well-made, great value, and really easy to use, clean and assemble. If you need a bigger batch, the sleek Soulhand cold drip coffee machine is the perfect option.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
