It sent me into a blind panic,\" she said.\n\nHowever, she was given a drug called Palbociclib, which had only just been approved for NHS use.\n\n\"If it hadn't, my prognosis would have been very different,\" Nicky said.\n\nWhat is secondary breast cancer?\n\nIn stage four breast cancer, the breast cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body, such as the bones, lungs, liver or brain.\n\nIt is also called advanced cancer, secondary breast cancer, or metastatic breast cancer.\n\nThe cancer is not curable at this point but may be controlled with treatment for some years.\n\nPossible treatments include hormone therapy, chemotherapy, targeted drug therapy and radiotherapy.\n\nSource: Cancer Research UK\n\nTreatment may have halted the spread of the disease but it has robbed both women of the chance to have children.\n\nNicky said when she left hospital, she was \"grieving more for the fact that I had lost my chance to be a mother than because I had cancer\".\n\nImage copyright Cancer Research UK Image caption They hope Secondary Sisters will spread awareness of what it means to have secondary cancer\n\nLaura was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014 after finding a lump while on holiday.\n\nShe underwent a mastectomy and chemotherapy and recovered well.\n\nBut in April 2016, pain in Laura's right shoulder got steadily worse and she was referred for a scan.\n\nA tumour had overtaken the head of the humerus - the bone in the arm between the shoulder and elbow.\n\n\"It was terrifying, 2016 was a rubbish year, a really rubbish year,\" she said.\n\nLaura has traces of breast cancer in her spine, 12 vertebrae and pelvis but said: \"I'm very grateful the treatment I'm having is managing to live me a fairly normal life.\"", "description": "Nicky Newman and Laura Middleton-Hughes have cancer that has spread around their bodies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5CFB/production/_109130832_44a38fea-b25b-488a-8180-60bf21eeaf83.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
