There is no cure or vaccine for the deadly and highly contagious disease, which does not affect people.\n\nAs of July 1, the Philippine swine herd was estimated at 12.7 million heads, including about 8 million pigs in backyard farms and 4.7 million in commercial farms, according to government data.\n\nMore than 7,000 hogs have been culled in the affected areas, some of them buried alive, Dar said.\n\nThe Philippines has so far banned pork and pork-based products from more than a dozen countries, including Vietnam, Laos and China. In China, the world\u2019s biggest pork consumer, the outbreak has spread through every province and region of the mainland, as well as to Hong Kong and Hainan island, reducing the size of the country\u2019s hog herd by one-third.\n\nThe Philippines\u2019 import ban also covers pork and pork-based products from Germany, North Korea, Belgium, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Moldova, South Africa, Zambia, and Mongolia.\n\nInside the country, the Department of Agriculture (DA) has tightened animal quarantine and food safety measures, prohibiting the transport of live animals and meat products without health and shipping permits.\n\nNO NEED TO FEAR PORK\n\nAgriculture officials suspect the virus was brought to local farms via food scraps, or swill, from hotels and restaurants fed to pigs, or from imported pork products. They reminded farm owners that the transport, handling, disposal and sale of swill without proper permits and not in accordance with the existing regulations is unlawful.\n\nThey said the public should not fear eating pork, assuring that hogs that passed through the proper process of slaughtering and preparation are safe.\n\nBefore slaughtering, hogs are validated and assessed by a veterinarian, who then issues a medical certificate, the DA said in a statement.\n\nOnce slaughtered, the meats are stamped with a seal from the government\u2019s National Meat Inspection Service.\n\n\u201cWe believe we have successfully managed the issue,\u201d the DA said.\n\nFinance Secretary Carlos Dominguez sought to downplay the impact of African swine fever on food prices as he said consumers are likely to turn to poultry, beef and fish as substitutes.", "description": "Dead pigs found in some backyard farms in the Philippines tested positive for African swine fever, the country's agriculture chief said on Monday, the first outbreak of the virus detected in the world's 10th largest pork consumer.", "authors": ["Enrico Dela Cruz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
