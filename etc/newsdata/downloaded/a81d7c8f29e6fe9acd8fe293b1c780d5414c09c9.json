In the second half, the Cleveland Browns\u2019 star receiver threw a punch and Humphrey ended up on top of Beckham with both hands on his neck. At least that\u2019s what it looked like.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nThe Ravens site had a curious tweet on Tuesday, saying they looked into it and their player didn\u2019t do what he was accused of.\n\nRavens say Marlon Humphrey did nothing wrong\n\nNo ejections came from the altercation, which was surprising, but there was still a fallout after the game.\n\nThe Ravens site broke down the video and came to the conclusion Humphrey was innocent of all charges. Included in the story on the site was the line that \u201cHumphrey definitely did not choke Beckham.\u201d\n\nOK then.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about the play between Marlon Humphrey and Odell Beckham Jr.\n\n\n\nClose-up video shows exactly what happened, and that Humphrey didn\u2019t choke him.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcf0: https://t.co/mdpmljNMxl pic.twitter.com/AO9KAfCW6a \u2014 Baltimore Ravens (@Ravens) October 1, 2019\n\nThe Ravens\u2019 site also offered evidence like Beckham having been held without a catch to the point of the fight, which \u201cclearly got under his skin.\u201d Fair and balanced.\n\nBrowns don\u2019t agree with Ravens\n\nTry convincing Browns coach Freddie Kitchens that Humphrey didn\u2019t choke Beckham. On Tuesday he responded, \"Did you see the video? That's my response.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, he had much more to say about the issue.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s my big deal with that: I just want to have consistency on how we\u2019re going to deal with things, OK?\u201d Kitchens said, via the Ravens site. \u201cI don\u2019t like seeing our player on the field and someone\u2019s hands around his throat. I don\u2019t like that. I don\u2019t think that needs to be in our game, and I would be the first to say that if it was our guy doing it.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Humphrey choked Beckham or did something else out of the rules, that\u2019s for the NFL to decide when it hands out its weekly fines. They\u2019ll be looking closely at the video too.\n\nCleveland Browns wide receiver Odell Beckham (13) is hit by Baltimore Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey (44) on Sunday.
