Commitment to that mission is more important to us than anything else. We're better off knowing about this lack of commitment now, rather than later\", Libra Association said in a statement. Facebook Inc declined to comment.\n\nFacebook announced plans to launch the digital currency in June 2020 in partnership with other members of Libra Association but the project quickly ran into trouble with skeptical regulators around the world.\n\nReuters reported last week that Facebook could push back the launch of Libra to tackle regulatory concerns.\n\nVisa and Mastercard Inc are also reconsidering their involvement in Libra as they do not want to attract regulatory scrutiny, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.
