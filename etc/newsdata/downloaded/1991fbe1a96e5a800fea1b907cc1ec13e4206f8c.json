And while he was very impressed by the state-of-the-art facilities at the performance institute, he returned with a crucial takeaway: the recovery process after training.\n\n\u201cMany of us do recovery work occasionally, but what I learnt from the training stint is that recovery should always be factored in my training schedule,\u201d he told Yahoo News Singapore in an interview at Swissotel The Stamford on Thursday (24 October), two weeks after returning from Shanghai.\n\n\u201cIf you recover well, especially after being a little banged up after a tough session, then you can train better the next time. And if you keep at it, in the long run, you will feel the positive effects on your training capabilities.\u201d\n\nAs Tang trained with top Chinese MMA athletes six times a week at the performance institute, sometimes up to three sessions a day, coaches also encouraged recovery work after each session. Tang would do different types of recovery work such as ice baths, sauna and cryotherapy.\n\nSingapore mixed martial arts fighter Garie Tang posing outside the 93,000 square-foot UFC performance institute in Shanghai. (PHOTO: Garie Tang MMA/Facebook) More\n\nThe performance institute has a strong support staff in the fields of strength and conditioning, nutrition and physical therapy \u2013 all in a bid to maximise and sharpen a fighter\u2019s skills in the highly-competitive MMA scene.\n\nTang, who has a win-loss record of four wins and a loss since he turned professional in 2011, believes he has already felt the benefits of his Shanghai stint.\n\n\u201cObviously, training with the top guys in China almost daily, your skills are definitely sharpened. I can understand better how to train and recover up to the require standards to be successful in the sport,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNow I have to implement what I have learnt back in Singapore. I have already discussed with coaches at my gym, Impact Gym, on how we can train according to what I had undergone in Shanghai.\u201d\n\nHis training stint comes at an ideal time, as he prepares to represent Singapore at the upcoming SEA Games in the Philippines \u2013 not in MMA, but in the obscure combat sports of sambo.\n\nSambo, a martial art developed by the Soviet Union army in the 1920s, is being competed for the first time at the biennial Games, and Tang \u2013 who will compete in the Under-57kg division \u2013 has set himself on winning a gold medal for his country.\n\n\u201cIt has motivated me to train a lot harder in the last few months, and I think with the knowledge and training that I got in Shanghai, I\u2019m feeling quite positive for the SEA Games,\u201d he said.\n\nOther Singapore stories:\n\nExtended operating hours for SMRT trains, buses on Deepavali eve\n\nSingapore slowdown may be nearing end, central bank chief says\n\nSingapore ranks 21 of 30 nations in soft power list, No. 1 in Enterprise", "description": "SINGAPORE \u2014 For four weeks across September and October, Garie Tang lived and breathed mixed martial arts, as he trained at Ultimate Fighting Championship\u2019s new performance institute in Shanghai.", "authors": ["Chia Han Keong"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XshTja.jkIhYHqOvzUEt9g--~B/aD02MzM7dz05Mzk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/1907ade0-f624-11e9-aacf-98edb21279f4", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
