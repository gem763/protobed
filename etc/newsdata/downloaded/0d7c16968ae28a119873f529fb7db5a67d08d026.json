The best responses will be published that night.\n\nDon\u2019t Buy the Hype\n\nIt\u2019s past time to smoke out the hysteria surrounding e-cigarettes. The numbers don\u2019t lie. While seven unfortunate deaths related to e-cigarettes have recently made the headlines, about 150,000 Americans died last year of lung cancer\u2014with tobacco as the major culprit.\n\nTo vape is to choose the much lesser of two evils. One randomized trial from the U.K. found that vaping was twice as effective as nicotine patches and gum at getting smokers to quit their habit successfully. Even if vaping is somewhat detrimental to lung health\u2014mostly due to modified or illegal cartridges\u2014we allow people to harm their bodies in all kinds of ways. That\u2019s part of the American vision of freedom.\n\nCigarette smoking is dangerous not only to smokers but also to everyone around them. The heat generated at the end of the cigarette releases small, unstable pollutants into the air which have been implicated in some 40,000 annual U.S. deaths. E-cigarettes, which don\u2019t reach nearly the same temperatures, spare the rest of us from inhaling these pollutants.\n\nThe antivaping hysteria is so much smoke. But where's the fire?\n\n\u2014 Adam Barsouk, Jefferson University, medicine\n\nYou\u2019re Gambling With Kids\u2019 Lives\n\nLarge numbers of young people who wouldn\u2019t touch conventional cigarettes are developing nicotine addictions from e-cigarettes. Vaping companies have lured teens with appealing flavors, the components of which have been linked to pulmonary toxicity and respiratory failure in some cases. And while e-cigarettes deliver nicotine in a noncombustible fashion, users may inhale metallic fumes from the coil and wick used to heat the e-liquid in the lithium-charged devices.\n\nThis means that e-cigarettes are not definitively safe. Though companies tout their products as a better alternative to cigarettes, that's not exactly a high bar and the scientific evidence is inconclusive. Troublingly, the data on long-term health consequences to teen users remain to be seen.\n\nAfter the recent news that six vapers died from a mysterious respiratory disease, we need to take action. Without conclusive scientific evidence, e-cigarette companies should not be allowed to market their products as a safer alternative to smoking. In addressing adolescent usage, the Trump administration is right to initiate a ban on flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nThe data on e-cigarettes is sorely limited. As with cigarette research in the 20th century, it will take decades to determine the lifelong harm of e-cigarette use. There is no need to gamble with young people\u2019s long-term health in the meantime.\n\n\u2014 Katrina Geannopoulos, University of Illinois in Chicago, medicine\n\nApply the Law, Stave off the Nanny State\n\nThough the exponential growth in the popularity of electronic cigarettes is alarming, their relatively low risk should be reassuring. Public Health England found that vaping is 95% less harmful than smoking traditional cigarettes. While reading media reports of the risks of vaping, it\u2019s important to remember where the real danger lies: Cigarette smoking was responsible for around 480,000 deaths in the U.S. last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nVaping has been connected with only seven deaths and 500 hospitalizations in America over the past year. One common thread between many of them has been the presence of vitamin E acetate, which is used in some black-market THC cartridges. These substances are not used by JUUL in its popular cartridges or by other leading mainstream brands.\n\nTHC (tetrahydrocannabinol, a compound in marijuana known for its psychoactive effects) is already illegal in many states and on the federal level, and minors are not allowed to have THC in any state. Authorities should prosecute those who give drugs to minors. Suppliers of products that lead to deaths or injuries should be sued by victims. But there is no reason to crack down on safe, mainstream vaping companies. America isn\u2019t meant to be a nanny state. By banning flavored e-cigarettes, the Trump administration will only help expand the black market that is largely responsible for the illnesses, putting more people at risk, and harm businesses that offer smokers a safer alternative.\n\n\u2014 John Stoetzel, University of North Carolina-Charlotte, economics\n\n\u201c By banning flavored e-cigarettes, the Trump administration will only help expand the black-market that is largely responsible for the illnesses, putting more people at risk, and harm businesses that offer smokers a safer alternative. \u201d\n\nToo Soon to Say\n\nVaping has become a casual addiction for many teenagers and young adults. Users often don\u2019t leave the house without their device in hand. They seem to feel safe because clear-cut dangers have not yet been extrapolated from the available research, but this shouldn\u2019t be read as a green light to justify unlimited use. Human lungs aren\u2019t naturally disposed to process the chemicals present in flavored vape juices\u2014that\u2019s the bottom line. These should be used in moderation, if at all.\n\nHow the law should respond is a separate question. As long as traditional cigarettes are legal it seems irrational to ban vaping. If one absolutely must smoke something, vaping is still the healthier way to go.\n\n\u2014 Tatiana Uram, Loyola University Chicago, neuroscience\n\nClick here to submit a response to the next Future View.", "description": "Is the controversy all smoke or is there fire?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108029/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
