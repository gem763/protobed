Cory Booker raised $6 million over the third fundraising quarter, marking his best haul of the 2020 presidential campaign, but leaving him far behind some of his rivals.\n\n\u201cWe will report raising over $6 million in Q3, a greater than 30 percent increase over our Q2 number,\u201d his campaign manager Addisu Demissie said in a memo. \u201cWhile other campaigns\u2019 fundraising trajectory has slowed, Cory 2020 is on the rise.\u201d\n\nThe Booker campaign maintains that the race is far from over and that most voters are still persuadable.\n\nMr. Booker said he raised more than $2 million over the final ten days of the quarter after warning supporters that he couldn\u2019t envision a path to the nomination if he couldn\u2019t close out the month by raising at least $1.7 million\n\n\u201cOur September 30th goal was very much the floor and not the ceiling \u2014 and in the weeks to come we\u2019ll be asking more of all of those who want to keep Cory\u2019s important voice in this race,\u201d Mr. Demissie said. \u201cWhat the last ten days have done is put us firmly in the game.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
