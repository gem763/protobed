But it had grown, undetected, until it was so large that it finally weighed her ovary down, twisting the fallopian tube like you\u2019d wring out a sponge. This is called ovarian torsion, and it creates the kind of organ-failure pain few people experience and live to tell about.\n\n\u201cOvarian torsion represents a true surgical emergency,\u201d says an article in the medical journal Case Reports in Emergency Medicine. \u201cHigh clinical suspicion is important. \u2026 Ramifications include ovarian loss, intra-abdominal infection, sepsis, and even death.\u201d The best chance of salvaging a torsed ovary is surgery within eight hours of when the pain starts.\n\n* * *\n\nThere is nothing like witnessing a loved one in deadly agony. Your muscles swell with the blood they need to fight or run. I felt like I could bend iron, tear nylon, through the 10-minute ambulance ride and as we entered the windowless basement hallways of the hospital.\n\nAnd there we stopped. The intake line was long\u2014a row of cots stretched down the darkened hall. Someone wheeled a gurney out for Rachel. Shaking, she got herself between the sheets, lay down, and officially became a patient.\n\nEmergency-room patients are supposed to be immediately assessed and treated according to the urgency of their condition. Most hospitals use the Emergency Severity Index, a five-level system that categorizes patients on a scale from \u201cresuscitate\u201d (treat immediately) to \u201cnon-urgent\u201d (treat within two to 24 hours).\n\nI knew which end of the spectrum we were on. Rachel was nearly crucified with pain, her arms gripping the metal rails blanched-knuckle tight. I flagged down the first nurse I could.\n\n\u201cMy wife,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen her like this. Something\u2019s wrong, you have to see her.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll have to wait her turn,\u201d she said. Other nurses\u2019 reactions ranged from dismissive to condescending. \u201cYou\u2019re just feeling a little pain, honey,\u201d one of them told Rachel, all but patting her head.\n\nWe didn\u2019t know her ovary was dying, calling out in the starkest language the body has. I saw only the way Rachel\u2019s whole face twisted with the pain.\n\nSoon, I started to realize\u2014in a kind of panic\u2014that there was no system of triage in effect. The other patients in the line slept peacefully, or stared up at the ceiling, bored, or chatted with their loved ones. It seemed that arrival order, not symptom severity, would determine when we\u2019d be seen.\n\nAs we neared the ward\u2019s open door, a nurse came to take Rachel\u2019s blood pressure. By then, Rachel was writhing so uncontrollably that the nurse couldn\u2019t get her reading.\n\nShe sighed and put down her squeezebox.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to sit still, or we\u2019ll just have to start over,\u201d she said.", "description": "When my wife was struck by mysterious, debilitating symptoms, our trip to the ER revealed the sexism inherent in emergency treatment.", "authors": ["Joe Fassler"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/10/shutterstock_149926544_1/facebook.jpg?1522799211", "published_at": "2015-10-15"}
