CREDIT: Yale.\n\nThis climate silence leads the public to underestimate how many other Americans realize climate change is happening. They \u201cunderestimate the social consensus on global warming,\u201d as the Yale researchers explained. Remarkably, the Yale survey found that the public estimates that just 54% of other Americans realize climate change is happening, but in reality, 69% do.\n\nAt the same time, a 2018 study found that \u201conly 11 percent of the U.S. public correctly estimate the scientific consensus on climate change as higher than 90 percent.\u201d It also found that telling people how big the actual consensus is \u201cincreases their perception of the scientific norm by 16.2 percentage points on a 100-point scale.\u201d\n\nSCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS RESULTS ON THE QUESTION OF HUMAN-CAUSED GLOBAL WARMING. CREDIT: JOHN COOK.\n\nInspired by the fact that increased awareness increases acceptance, the authors of the PNAS study decided to find out what would happen if they tracked over time \u201cchanges in perceptions of scientific consensus as a result of discussion with family and friends.\u201d\n\nThey also tracked how perceptions of the consensus affect climate change discussions as well as how discussions indirectly affect people\u2019s understanding of, and concern about, climate change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study concluded that \u201cincreased perceptions of scientific agreement led to increases in discussions about climate change.\u201d This suggests that \u201cclimate conversations can initiate a positively reinforcing cycle between learning, worry, and further conversation.\u201d\n\nIn other words, talking about the climate crisis to family and friends motivates them to learn about the overwhelming scientific consensus that global warming is happening and humans are the cause \u2014 along with other key facts. Increased understanding of the consensus in turns leads to an increase in understanding and concern about the climate.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead author, Yale social psychologist Matthew Goldberg, told The Los Angeles Times Monday that talking more about climate change is \u201cmassively important, particularly because we are not doing it enough.\u201d\n\nThere are a variety of ways to communicate the consensus message to friends and family. The simplest version is to state that 97% of climate scientists understand that humans are causing climate change.\n\nA more specific version: The overwhelming majority of climate scientists \u2014 97% \u2014 understand that humans are the primary cause of global warming since 1950.\n\nAnd a good analogy? We are as certain that humans are responsible for recent climate change as we are that cigarettes are dangerous to your health.\n\nHowever you say it, experts agree: It\u2019s vital everyone talk about climate change with as many of their friends and family as possible.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/climate-science-consensus.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}
