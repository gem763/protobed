Whitman co-chairs the taskforce with former US attorney Preet Bharara.\n\n\u201cRight now, any finding that seems to be restricting business, especially the energy industry, appears to be destined for elimination,\u201d Whitman said.\n\nThe taskforce, formed under the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law, cites the recent \u201csharpiegate\u201d scandal, in which Trump erroneously claimed a hurricane would hit Alabama, subsequently holding up a doctored map. Officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were reportedly pressured to back the president or face being fired.\n\nIn another case, economists at the Department of Agriculture were relocated after they published findings showing the Trump administration\u2019s trade policies would harm farmers. Meanwhile, the Department of Interior reassigned a climate scientist to an accounting role after he warned about the impact of global heating on Arctic communities.\n\nThe silenced: meet the climate whistleblowers muzzled by Trump Read more\n\nAt the Environmental Protection Agency, scientific advisory boards have been redrawn to include more industry representatives. The EPA\u2019s leadership also told scientists to reverse their findings in a report that showed the economic benefits to protecting wetlands from pollution, while suppressing a separate study that found a far greater threat is posed by a toxic chemical in water than previously thought.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it, without credible science the fundamental responsibilities of our government are threatened,\u201d said Thomas Burke, who was a senior official in the EPA\u2019s office of research and development during the Obama administration. \u201cI fear the public has lost faith in our agencies, and our best and brightest are being discouraged and blocked from federal service.\n\n\u201cAs a former federal scientist and veteran of the appointment process I often ask \u2018why would anyone want to serve at the highest levels of our science-based agencies in this time of science denial?\u2019 We have to protect our scientists and the integrity of their work.\u201d\n\nThe taskforce, which also includes the former secretary of defense Chuck Hagel, makes clear that the mistreatment of science didn\u2019t start under Trump. The report recalls how government reports were edited to downplay the link between carbon emissions and climate change under the George W Bush administration, as well as improper changes to a study on the impact of fracking on drinking water during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nBut the group warns that the problem has escalated under Trump due a combination of hefty campaign contributions from special interests, the appointment of unqualified cronies to senior positions and the reluctance of Congress to act as a proper check.\n\nIn order to remedy the current situation, the report recommends new scientific integrity standards at government agencies, fresh rules to eliminate manipulation or suppression of research and better public access to government data.\n\nHowever, even the introduction of new laws would only do so much, Whitman warned. \u201cEstablishing laws of conduct will go a great way toward driving more sciences-based decisions, but issues such as climate change will require leadership from the top,\u201d she said.", "description": "Nonpartisan taskforce of ex-government officials reports \u2018almost weekly violations\u2019 of norms meant to safeguard objective research", "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fe76a3cfa651b082f350e9e4516b4c2adfbbdf2/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=34e41d07af7323e82d4312f57b3b0813"}
