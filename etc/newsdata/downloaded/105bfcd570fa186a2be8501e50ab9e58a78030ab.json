But will their past be held against them?", "language": "en", "text": "Yet because regulations in Rhode Island and most other states exclude people with criminal backgrounds from many jobs, Lincoln\u2019s record, which includes sentences for robbery and assault, may well be held against him.\n\nAcross the country, more than 10,000 regulations restrict people with criminal records from obtaining occupational licenses, according to a database developed by the American Bar Association. The restrictions are defended as a way to protect the public. But Lincoln and others point out that the rules are often arbitrary and ambiguous.\n\nLicensing boards in Rhode Island can withhold licenses for crimes committed decades ago, by citing a requirement that people display \u201cgood moral character,\u201d without taking into account individual circumstances or efforts toward rehabilitation.\n\nSuch restrictions make it challenging for the formerly incarcerated to enter or move up in fast-growing industries such as health care, human services and some mechanical trades, according to civil liberties lawyers and economists.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Graphics Business Jobs-After-Prison-Rhode-Island-Recently-Occupational-Licensing"], "top_image": ""}
