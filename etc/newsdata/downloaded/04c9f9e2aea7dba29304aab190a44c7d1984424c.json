She managed to call the police who arrested the customer. The woman was reported to be \u201cdismayed and frightened\u201d.\n\nThe incident is the latest claim of a tourist behaving badly in the lagoon city. In September a gondolier was headbutted and punched in the face by a man from South America after clashing over a selfie. The tourist had boarded a moored vessel to take a selfie with his family and became aggressive after the gondolier told him to either get out of the boat or pay for a ride.\n\nVenice authorities are imposing much harsher penalties on delinquent tourists, with two Czech visitors recently fined \u20ac3,000 for \u201cobscene acts\u201d when they were caught skinny-dipping in a canal close to St Mark\u2019s Square.\n\nIn June, two German tourists were fined \u20ac1,000 and asked to leave the city after being caught preparing coffee with a camping stove on Rialto Bridge. The pair had violated one of the city\u2019s \u201curban decorum\u201d rules, which include bans on snacking on bridges and the steps of monuments and swimming or dipping toes in canals.", "description": "Woman reportedly held hostage in latest incident involving visitors to Italian city", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d38c951d6cd88fa783d0ea8700da18a01ea95d4/0_399_5954_3573/master/5954.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b90fdd72163a27eea70c0efed399890b", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
