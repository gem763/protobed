The move comes amid a range of inquiries into issues involving Cho and his wife including their children\u2019s university applications and an investment in a private equity fund. Cho has denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe Seoul Central Prosecutors Office, the Justice Ministry and the presidential office declined to comment when reached by phone Monday.\n\nThe raid comes two weeks after Moon appointed Cho -- a political ally and close confidant -- despite parliamentary resistance to his nomination. The president\u2019s approval rating slipped to a record low of 40% last week, a regular Gallup Korea survey showed, as the appointment controversy, a slowing economy and setbacks in U.S.-North Korea talks all weighed on his support.\n\nProsecutors are investigating how Cho\u2019s daughter won admission to a prestigious university after she was credited as a main author of a published scientific paper while a high school student on a brief internship. They\u2019re also looking into how his family made a hefty profit from a questionable investment in the private equity fund.\n\nCho\u2019s university professor wife Chung Kyung-shim was indicted earlier this month on allegations that she interfered with the probe by forging documents, YTN reported. Chung has denied the allegations in a Facebook post.\n\nOn Monday, prosecutors visited Cho\u2019s home in southern Seoul to collect computer hard drives and numerous work-related documents, Yonhap said. Investigators have visited numerous locations related to the probes, including the private equity fund\u2019s office and university campuses.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jihye Lee in Seoul at jlee2352@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net, Karen Leigh\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- South Korean prosecutors raided the home of Justice Minister Cho Kuk, the Yonhap News Agency reported, as part of a widening corruption investigation that has already dented support for President Moon Jae-in.Investigators entered Cho\u2019s house shortly after 9 a.m. Monday, Yonhap said, citing", "authors": ["Jihye Lee"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
