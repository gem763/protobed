And, in the eyes of the 67-year-old Democrat, just as troubling is the notion that Congress has fallen flat on its constitutional duty to check the administration.\n\nExpect that to change if Democrats retake the House in November. Then, the Baltimore congressman is set to become the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, giving him subpoena power and the ability to call as many hearings as he wants on whichever topics he chooses.\n\nIn light of everything he\u2019s learned about Trump\u2014and especially after Senate testimony last week by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which Cummings saw as dishonest\u2014the congressman doubts he\u2019ll be able to believe any denial from anyone in the administration, regardless of whether they\u2019re under oath, he said in an interview for POLITICO\u2019s Off Message podcast.\n\n\u201cOh no, no. Uh-uh. No,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cI worry more about getting documents. If I can get documents, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nExcited by the polls, Democrats have been fantasizing about all the investigations they\u2019ll launch when they control Congress, the way they\u2019ll swamp the White House with more requests than a staff that\u2019s already stretched thin\u2014one likely to see more departures after November\u2014will be able to handle.\n\nCummings is prepping targets\u2014from the security clearances of Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, to digging into how former EPA chief Scott Pruitt was able to keep his job for so long\u2014and the list is getting longer by the week.\n\nJust last week, he says, he added to it claims by the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2018s staff\u2014made without further detail\u2014that two men had separately come forward to each claim responsibility for sexually assaulting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has alleged Kavanaugh assaulted her as a teenager.\n\n\u201cI want to find out,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cDid [the staff] have someone who came\u2014or two people\u2014who came and admitted a crime, and what did they do about it? What are their names? Who are they? I\u2019d like for them to come before us and let us know what they did and when they did it and how they did it.\u201d\n\nHe jokes that watching the Judiciary Committee hearings is the only time he wishes he had run for Senate, as he\u2019d considered doing for the seat that his former House colleague Chris Van Hollen won in 2016.\n\nAfter a year of health problems that had him laid up in the hospital for six months after heart surgery\u2014and still using a walker and a cane to recover from a knee injury\u2014Cummings says his new sense of mortality has shot through his approach to the job.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s cut through the unnecessary BS and let\u2019s get to the facts\u2014and I do not want anybody wasting my time. Nor do I want to waste the time of my committee members, or my family members,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cAnd I damn sure don\u2019t want to waste my time.\u201d\n\nCummings is a private man. Staffers who\u2019ve known him for years don\u2019t know basic details of his personal life, the result of a clear division he draws between his family time and government work. He doesn\u2019t do many interviews. He\u2019s been in politics for 35 years, in Congress representing Baltimore since 1996. Most Sundays, he\u2019s in church instead of working the TV show circuit. He\u2019s a proud member of the Congressional Black Caucus and has been since he got to Washington, but he\u2019s deliberately not defined himself as a black leader in Congress. He\u2019s better known for burrowing down into committee work and gaining friends in every pocket of the caucus, including a number of Republicans\u2014a fact that has some people thinking he could wind up as speaker of the House if Nancy Pelosi stumbles.\n\n\n\nClick here for the full podcast, including what Cummings says he learned from having two Pentecostal preachers as parents, and why his faith is defined by what he calls \u201ca recycling god.\u201d\n\nBut even if she doesn\u2019t, if Democrats take the House, Cummings will be one of the three most important committee chairs going up against the White House, along with California\u2019s Adam Schiff on Intelligence, managing the Russia probe, and New York\u2019s Jerry Nadler on Judiciary, trying to thread the needle on a response to those calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\n\u201cHe will not be bashful. He will be aggressive,\u201d said Jason Chaffetz, the former Utah GOP congressman who chaired the Oversight Committee with Cummings as its ranking member. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll probably disagree with everything he does.\u201d\n\nChaffetz pointed out that Cummings, despite his friendship with President Barack Obama, co-signed 300 letters from the committee to provide oversight of the Obama administration. But Chaffetz warned that House Democrats may be overestimating how much they\u2019ll be able to get out of a reluctant White House, and argued that they would have been better off joining with Republicans to demand intelligence information that the administration was trying to keep secret.\n\n\u201cIf [North Carolina Rep.] Mark Meadows and [Ohio Rep.] Jim Jordan can\u2019t get documents out of the White House, I don\u2019t know why Elijah Cummings and the Democrats think they\u2019ll do any better,\u201d Chaffetz said.\n\nSit down with Cummings for a while, and the frustration comes out, punctuated with the occasional \u201ccome on, now!\u201d He\u2019s still annoyed about what happened after he approached Trump at the post-inauguration luncheon to say they could work together on lowering prescription drug prices: Trump invited Cummings to the White House, the two had a good meeting, and then Cummings heard the president publicly crediting Cummings with saying that Trump would \u201cgo down as one of the great presidents.\u201d (Cummings says his statement was surrounded by a lot of caveats and \u201cif\u201d statements, none of which Trump has fulfilled).\n\nIt\u2019s not just that the president obviously misrepresented him, Cummings said, and that his takeaway from the experience is, \u201cI have to really be careful if I ever talk to him or meet with him, I have to have somebody present, to be a witness.\u201d The bigger frustration is that he hasn\u2019t heard from the White House for close to a year about the prescription drug prices that Cummings says are costing people their lives\u2014and which Trump said he cared about.\n\nHe\u2019s particularly offended by the GOP approach to voting rights. Where are the Republicans willing to revise the Voting Rights Act, he asks, as the Supreme Court suggested Congress do in its decision striking down a key section of it in 2014?\n\nHe thinks about his mother, who died in February at age 92, born a sharecropper in South Carolina, just like his father, and who came to still-segregated Baltimore in the 1940s looking for something better.\n\n\u201cMy mother, on her dying bed, the last thing she said to me was, \u2018Do not let them take away our right to vote.\u2019 And then she died. Why? Because she had seen the pain that people had gone through to get the vote, what it meant to see for her,\u201d Cummings said.\n\nHe\u2019s a collaborative person. He makes actual friendships across the aisle. He doesn\u2019t throw flames just for the sake of it.\n\nNot on this.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how somebody there\u2014a Republican\u2014can go and say, \u2018I\u2019m your friend,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not my friend. How can you be my friend when you won\u2019t even let me control my own destiny? How can you be my friend?\u201d\n\nStill, Cummings said, he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll have a hard time working the balance between Democrats who\u2019ll insist that no matter how many investigations he launches that he\u2019s not doing enough, and Republicans who\u2019ll insist that no matter how tight a grip he keeps on them, that he\u2019s overreaching.\n\n\u201cI tell my constituents, \u2018We are in a storm. It\u2019s a big storm. It\u2019s called the Trump storm,\u2019\u201d Cummings said. \u201c\u2018The question is not whether the storm will end, but \u2018Where will you be? What will you have? Will you be living when that storm ends?\u2019 That\u2019s the question. So, in the meantime, we\u2019ve got to respect that storm and deal with it.\u201d", "description": "If Democrats retake the House, the Maryland congressman will likely become the new chair of the Oversight Committee.
