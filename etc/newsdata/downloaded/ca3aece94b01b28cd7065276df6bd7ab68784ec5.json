In addition, there is a large area of \"grey\" ice. Darker ice, absorbs more solar radiation and so melts quicker.\n\nMelt ponds in western Greenland, active 2019 wildfire, and 2017 wildfire burn scar, Greenland - August 1st, 2019 Contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data [2019], processed by Pierre Markuse\n\nDanish Meteorological Institute's Climate scientist Ruth Mottram says the paler spots in the dark band \"might indicate where supraglacial lakes have drained\".\n\nThe organisation's Greenland ice Twitter account explains \"the famous\" west Greenland dark band is composed of dust accumulated in the lower ice layers \"from the glacial age ice\" and that \"provides the perfect conditions for algae and bacteria to grow and further darken the ice, accelerating melt in this region\".\n\nFinnish scientist Antti Lipponen shows the evolution of roughly the same area since 2001. In the animation we can clearly appreciate the ice sheet narrowing. He also made an animation showing Greenland's rapid melt since May. You can watch the videos on the player above.\n\nGreenland's heatwave comes as Vladimir Putin called in the army to help tackle wildfires in Siberia that have covered an area nearly the size of Belgium.\n\nHow unusual are wildfires in Greenland?\n\nCopernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service senior scientist Mark Parrington has shared a graph showing how exceptional is to see a wildfire burning since early July.\n\nThis year has seen the most CO2 emissions from wildfires in Greenland since measurements began 17 years ago.\n\nPierre Markuse's expertise allows us to have a closer look at the Qeqqata wildfire, which is affecting an area of about 5.2 square km.\n\nWildfire in the Qeqqata Kommunia, Greenland - July 31st, 2019 Contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data [2019], processed by Pierre Markuse\n\nWhat about the melt?\n\nThis extreme melt event is not the largest on record. But the warm weather will be stuck in Greenland for the coming days, according to the forecasts.\n\nStill, the August 1, the melt measured 11 gigatonnes of water. \"Enough to flood the whole Germany with 7 cm,\" according to climate scientist Martin Stendel.\n\nIce sheet mass gains / losses through the year polarportal.dk\n\nScientists are especially concerned because the high temperatures have reached exceptionally high altitudes this summer.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday the extreme melt event in Greenland takes place \"at a time when Arctic Sea ice is already near record low levels\".\n\n\"Preventing irreversible climate disruption is the race of our lives and for our lives,\" he said. \"It is a race we can \u2014 and must \u2014 win.\"\n\nThe US Snow and Ice Institute data is not yet updated for August 1, but the July 31 surface melt extent graph shows how exceptional it has been until now.\n\nGreenland melt extent 2019 National Snow and Ice Data Center\n\nFrom the ground, US author Laurie Garrett, shared on Twitter this video of the melting water in Kangerlussiauq, by 22\u00ba C.
