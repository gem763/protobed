Grand total: an extra $800 billion worth of spending in ten years. That's a lot of money but there's no new federal spending for charter schools. Gee, I thought they had been successful but the teacher's union doesn't like them, so they're out. Eight hundred billion dollars extra for everything else but charter schools: not a penny.\n\nWhile we're on the spending side, please remember Senator Warren's \"plan\" to spend $1 trillion on universal childcare, $600 billion for \"free\" college and $640 billion on student debt forgiveness. And please, don't let the $32 trillion Medicare-for-all \"plan\" slip your mind. Senator Warren gives new meaning to the expression \"vote buying.\" Because that's what it is: \"Vote for me and look at what I'll give you.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nSo how does this all get paid for?\n\nAnswer: This can't all be paid for.\n\nSenator Warren wants a wealth tax, higher income tax rates, higher corporate taxes, higher death taxes and she still hasn't told us which tax will pay the trillions for Medicare-for-all. In short, her ideas are economic nonsense.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nAnd nobody, least of all the socialists, will say what all these taxes would do to the economy. It's a dangerous game: Promise a world you cannot pay for, just to buy votes.", "description": "'[Elizabeth Warren's] numerous \"plans\" are really tax and spend on steroids.'", "authors": ["Stuart Varney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/80879334-AP19282063643773.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
