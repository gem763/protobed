Paul McMillan\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Monopoly competition is back this month offering a chance to win expensive prizes, all for the price of a Big Mac. Given you could become tens of thousands of dollars richer by simply going on a Macca\u2019s run, McDonald\u2019s Monopoly games have in the past been subject to cheating and a multimillion-dollar scandal.\n\nBut for those who prefer to play fair, what are your chances of actually snaring a prize?\n\nPrizes, prizes, prizes\n\nTo take part you need to buy certain McDonald\u2019s food items that include peel-off Monopoly tickets. Each ticket has three different possible outcomes: an \u201cInstant win\u201d, a \u201cChance card\u201d or a \u201cCollect to win\u201d.\n\nInstant prizes are either a McDonald\u2019s food item such as a burger, or a non-food prize such as a movie ticket or a cash gift card, redeemed by entering the 12-digit code on the ticket into a phone app.\n\nA \u201cChance card\u201d ticket also provides a 12-digit code which, when entered into an app, provides another opportunity to nab an instant prize or a digital \u201cCollect to win\u201d ticket.\n\nThe \u201cCollect to win\u201d tickets are the real meat of the game, and yield the major prizes: sometimes a car or large amounts of money. To win one of these prizes, you need to collect all \u201cCollect to win\u201d tickets of the same colour, as you would playing the traditional Monopoly game.\n\nFor obvious reasons, McDonald\u2019s doesn\u2019t tell us much about how these tickets are distributed across Australia. But what it does tell us is the maximum number of prizes that can be awarded for each prize type.\n\nUsing some fairly basic number-crunching, we can get a better picture of what our chances are of winning a shiny new car just by purchasing a Big Mac meal.\n\nHow To Win At McDonald's Monopoly Macca\u2019s Monopoly is back until October 17 and with a $276 million prize-pool, there are plenty of reasons to get involved. We\u2019ve collected all the information you need right here, from the cheapest way to load up on tickets to all the free food on offer! Read more\n\nWhat the numbers reveal\n\nThis year, McDonald\u2019s says 136,634,083 tickets will be distributed across the fastfood giant\u2019s restaurants, and lists the maximum number of prizes available.\n\nWhile we have no way of determining whether or not this maximum is reached, we can still get a general idea of our chances of winning a prize by using these values.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s says there is a one-in-five chance of winning an instant prize, which could either be a food prize or a non-food prize.\n\nabout 18 million tickets yield instant food prizes, which gives a roughly 13.2% chance of winning\n\nabout 11.8 million tickets yield instant non-food prizes, which gives a roughly 8.7% chance of winning\n\nOf course, 13.2% plus 8.7% gives a 21.9% chance of winning an instant prize, on average, which roughly agrees with the one-in-five that McDonald\u2019s claims.\n\nThe Gambler\u2019s Fallacy\n\nIt\u2019s important not fall for the Gambler\u2019s Fallacy when trying to collect instant win tickets. Collecting five tickets does not mean that one of them will always be an instant win ticket.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s simply promises an average rate of an instant win, owing to the fact that about 20% of physical tickets include a prize of some sort.\n\nThere are 3,415,852 \u201cChance\u201d tickets available, so you have roughly a 2.5% chance of getting a \u201cChance\u201d ticket with your purchase.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s says one in five, or 20%, of Chance tickets will result in an instant win. Working the numbers means you have a 0.5% chance of obtaining a Chance ticket that will also get you a prize, so it\u2019s not a strategy you should be banking on.\n\nThe bigger prize tickets\n\nWhile we know how many \u201cInstant win\u201d and \u201cChance\u201d tickets there are, the details around the \u201cCollect to win\u201d part of the McDonald\u2019s Monopoly game are more closely guarded.\n\nGoing by previous observations, it seems that for each \u201cCollect to win\u201d ticket colour, all but one of each set will likely by very commonly distributed. The final one, not so common.\n\nIn this year\u2019s game there are two prizes available of a year of free fuel by collecting the three red tickets: The Strand, Fleet Street and Trafalgar Square.\n\nSo it\u2019s entirely possible that the probability of finding that final red ticket in the set could be as low as 2 in 136 million.\n\nIf you are planning on trying to win one of the major \u201cCollect to win\u201d prizes, these are the odds we think you should be expecting, even if you have collected all but one of the tickets needed, based on the number of prizes avaailable:\n\n1 in 136 million (one prize each)\n\none year car rental\n\nA$10,000 room makeover voucher\n\n1 in 68 million (two prizes each)\n\nA$5,000 travel gift card\n\none year of free fuel\n\ncar\n\n1 in 45 million (three prizes each)\n\nultimate gaming package\n\nhome theatre\n\n1 in 34 million (four prizes)\n\nBBQ set\n\n1 in 17 million (eight prizes)\n\nA$1,000 shopping voucher\n\nCan you hack the app?\n\nGiven each ticket has a 12-digit code you can enter into the app to see if you\u2019ve won a prize, a cheeky idea might be to enter random codes to see if you can guess a winning number.\n\nThere are several reasons why this is a waste of time (not least the fact that you need to present a physical copy of a ticket to collect a prize), but let\u2019s also get some mathematical perspective.\n\nEvery ticket code consists of a combination of letters and numbers. There are 9 possible numbers (1-9, ignoring 0 so as not to confuse with the letter O) and 26 possible letters (A-Z, capitals only) that can appear in a ticket code.\n\nThis means there are 35 possibilities for each of the 12 alphanumeric characters in a code. So how many possible 12-character codes are there? We can calculate that with:\n\n= 35 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 35 = 3512 = 3,379,220,508,056,640,625\n\nBut there are only a maximum of 136,634,083 tickets in the game.\n\nSo the probability of entering a random 12-digit code into the app and having it recognised as a valid ticket code is given by:\n\n= 136,634,083/(3512) = 0.00000000004\n\nIn other words, a 0.000000004% chance that you would have randomly picked a valid ticket code.\n\nCracking codes takes time\n\nA number this small is hard to imagine, so let\u2019s think of it another way. If you wanted to increases your chance of randomly picking a valid ticket code to roughly 4% (still a very slim chance!), you should be prepared to pick about 1011, or 100 billion random 12-character codes first.\n\nIf we assume that picking, entering and checking a code into the app only took you one second, then entering a hundred billion codes would take you about 3,180 years. The competition ends next month.\n\nIncidentally, this is one of the reasons why websites and email services encourage you to choose passwords that are at least eight characters long, with a mixture of numbers, letters and special characters. It takes a long time for people with nefarious intentions to guess your password if it\u2019s as long as a McDonald\u2019s Monopoly ticket code, even if they get a computer to help them.\n\nSo what\u2019s the best way to play?\n\nIf you remember that McDonald\u2019s Monopoly is much like a regular lottery, you\u2019ll be better off as you can relax and know that there\u2019s next to no chance that you will win a major prize.\n\nThe instant win aspect is a nice bonus if you\u2019re already planning on having a meal at McDonald\u2019s, since it\u2019s not all that unlikely that you could end up with some extra fries or a drink.\n\nSarah Belet, Postgraduate Student, Monash University and Jennifer Flegg, Senior Lecturer in Applied Mathematics, University of Melbourne\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.\n\nThis story has been updated since its original publication.", "description": "McDonald\u2019s Monopoly competition is back this month offering a chance to win expensive prizes, all for the price of a Big Mac.
