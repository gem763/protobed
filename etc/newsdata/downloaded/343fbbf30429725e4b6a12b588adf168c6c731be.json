As his day in court nears later this month, Frazee is pointing a finger at his once-secret girlfriend, Krystal Lee, a former rodeo queen and nurse, who told authorities she knows how Berreth was killed and why.\n\nAt the heart of the investigation is Lee, who told investigators Frazee asked her to kill his fianc\u00e9 with three different plots \u2013 though she couldn't go through with it. One of those attempts, Lee told investigators, was a scheme to get Berreth to drink a poisoned caramel macchiato from Starbucks. Prosecutors maintain Frazee ultimately murdered Berreth himself. According to Lee, Frazee told her he killed Berreth with a baseball bat. Berreth's body has never been found.\n\n\"All the clues in the case that investigators are getting are from one person,\" Ashley Franco, a reporter for KKTV-TV in Colorado Springs, Colorado tells CBS News correspondent Nikki Battiste. \"She's the bread and butter to this case. She's the only person in the world that they have to possibly convict Patrick Frazee.\"\n\nWho is Krystal Lee?\n\nA MOM DISAPPEARS\n\nThe images are haunting. A mother in the grocery store shopping with her baby. Thanksgiving Day, 2018 \u2014 the last time Kelsey Berreth was seen in public.\n\nSurveillance image of Kelsey Berreth on November 22, 2018, at the Woodland Park, Colorado, Safeway grocery store. Woodland Park Police Dept.\n\nCHERYL BERRETH [to reporters]: She's not the kind that runs off. This is completely out of character. Kelsey loves her God, she loves her family and friends and she loves her job.\n\nIt was Cheryl Berreth who reported her 29-year-old daughter missing after trying to reach her for days.\n\nCHERYL BERRETH [to reporters]: Kelsey we just want you home. Call us if you can. We won't quit looking [emotional].\n\nAt that time \u2013 in early December \u2013 Woodland Park Police had not publicly named a suspect.\n\nPOLICE CHIEF MILES DE YOUNG [to reporters]: We are treating Kelsey's disappearance as a missing person's case at this time.\n\nHer mother still had hope of finding Kelsey alive.\n\nCheryl Berreth: You can't eat, and you can't sleep \u2026 and the stress won't end until we find her.\n\nNikki Battiste: Did any of you text her or try to call her?\n\nAmanda Smith: I did. I told her that I hoped that she was OK and that I loved her.\n\nNikki Battiste: None of you received any responses?\n\nAmanda Smith: No\n\nNicole Haywood: No.\n\nAshley Cogburn: It does feel a little bit incomplete without Kelsey, because usually it was us four all together all the time.\n\nAshley Cogburn, Amanda Smith and Nicole Haywood had an unbreakable bond with Kelsey. They grew up together in Moses Lake, Washington.\n\nKelsey Berreth Cheryl Berreth\n\nNicole Haywood: From the pictures she's gorgeous, obviously, and very put together and so you might think that she's this prissy girl, but she was not. She was raised on a hay farm and very much a tomboy.\n\nNikki Battiste: A country girl?\n\nNicole Haywood: Yeah, she was out their driving tractors and bucking bales.\n\nAnd she was flying planes. She was a flight instructor.\n\nNikki Battiste: Do you remember Kelsey talking about wanting to be a pilot?\n\nAmanda Smith: Yeah \u2026 I actually got to go up with her one time and that was pretty amazing, I was terrified at first.\n\nNikki Battiste: Was she a good pilot?\n\nAmanda Smith: Oh, yeah [laughs]. She was really good.\n\nNicole Haywood: She wasn't afraid to challenge the typical boundaries.\n\nSo, it wasn't a surprise when a Colorado cowboy named Patrick Frazee caught Kelsey's eye on a dating website in 2016.\n\nNikki Battiste: Did Kelsey say what was it she liked about Patrick?\n\nAshley Cogburn: You know, he was, like, a country boy and that's what she was used to. That's what she liked.\n\nPatrick Frazee and Kelsey Berreth Cheryl Berreth\n\nThey started a long-distance relationship. Patrick Frazee lived on a 35-acre ranch in rural Florrisant, Colorado, where he trained cattle dogs, shoed horses and groomed donkeys.\n\nClint Cline has known Frazee for seven years.\n\nClint Cline: Patrick is the farrier for the donkeys \u2026 people call 'em horseshoers and all that, but our donkeys don't have shoes.\n\nNikki Battiste: So, he trims their feet?\n\nClint Cline: He trims their feet. He gives 'em, as we call it, donkey manicures.\n\nCline says Frazee was quiet and dedicated to his work.\n\nClint Cline: \u2026 He's kind of laid back, you know, kind of stays to himself. He had his ranch to take care of.\n\nNikki Battiste: Had you ever met Kelsey?\n\nClint Cline: I did. I met her one day, she came out during one of the trimmings and spent the day.\n\nNikki Battiste: Were they affectionate at all?\n\nClint Cline: Well, this isn't the most affectionate place in the world [laughs], so I'd say that day, no.\n\nEventually Kelsey moved to Colorado from Washington State to be closer to Frazee \u2013 and they were expecting a child. Her mother Cheryl says they were engaged.\n\nNikki Battiste: Did she have a dress yet?\n\nCheryl Berreth: No. I don't think she cared about the big wedding kind of thing. It was between them and God.\n\nEven after their daughter Kaylee was born in October 2017, the couple still didn't live together but shared parenting duties.\n\nAshley Cogburn: He never came to see her, but she would, like on her days off, she would go back and be with him.\n\nFriends say Kelsey was struggling to balance the baby, her job and a long commute. Her relationship with Frazee seemed strained.\n\nAshley Cogburn: \u2026 she seemed to be kind of stressed out from the whole thing that she couldn't make him happy.\n\nNikki Battiste: Was Patrick emotionally abusive?\n\nAshley Cogburn: It appeared that way from what I saw \u2026 And it seemed like it was just knocking her spirit down.\n\nNikki Battiste: Did Kelsey ever say he was physically abusive?\n\nAshley Cogburn: No.\n\nCogburn says Kelsey once mentioned there may have been another woman in Frazee's life.\n\nAshley Cogburn: I think Kelsey had mentioned one time about an ex-girlfriend who still kinda wanted to be with Patrick \u2026 Kelsey wasn't worried about it. I don't know if it's 'cause she knew she lived far away. Kelsey didn't seem all that worried about it.\n\nAfter Kelsey was reported missing \u2013 police talked to Frazee. He told them that the day before Thanksgiving, Kelsey said she wanted to end their relationship.\n\nAshley Franco | KKTV reporter: He said that Kelsey wanted to go their separate ways and things weren't working out between them. They wanted to split custody fifty/fifty and they were just not meshing anymore.\n\nPatrick Frazee told police he and Kelsey met to exchange the baby on Thanksgiving Day. He also returned Kelsey's belongings.\n\nAshley Franco: A purse, keys to the car, keys to the townhome and then a gun that Kelsey owned.\n\nIt was a gun Frazee says he had once taken from Kelsey for her own protection. Police say Frazee told them Kelsey struggled with depression hinting that she may be suicidal.\n\nNikki Battiste: When you hear that Patrick said Kelsey was unstable \u2026 that she was maybe suicidal.\n\nAshley Cogburn: No.\n\nAmanda Smith: No, not at all.\n\nAshley Cogburn: It doesn't match up with Kelsey.\n\nFrazee told investigators Kelsey was in treatment for substance abuse.\n\nNicole Haywood: That is the extreme opposite of who Kelsey was.\n\nHer friends say she did seek help, but for fatigue and stress.\n\nNicole Haywood: She did attend a program, but it was not, it was not a drug program. \u2026 it's nutrition \u2026 it's spiritual counseling. I want there to be no questions as to \u2026 the strength of her morals and her spiritual character.\n\nPolice searched Kelsey's home but turned up no signs of foul play. Then Cheryl Berreth and her son went to the house to check it out.\n\nAshley Franco: They want to find Kelsey, they want to know what happened to her, so they're staying in Kelsey's townhome and things kind of get a little odd \u2026 there was a mat \u2014 like a rug of some sort in the bathroom. And it's gone. \u2026 and she had also noticed that the refrigerator looked like it had been wiped down recently, you could see streaks. Later, her son \u2026 is in the bathroom and notices blood on the base of the toilet.\n\nNikki Battiste: And the alarms go off in their minds?\n\nAshley Franco: Alarms go off.\n\nKelsey's mother Cheryl alerted investigators who returned to the house. This time they used chemicals to detect the presence of blood.\n\nAshley Franco: They found trace amounts of blood everywhere in the bathroom.\n\nNikki Battiste: Do we know whose blood?\n\nAshley Franco: DNA results showed it was Kelsey's.\n\nThe discovery of Kelsey's blood inside her home was huge. Then, investigators found important evidence in Kelsey's driveway near her car.\n\nAshley Franco: They come back \u2026 with the cadaver dogs, the K9 units, and \u2026 they found human decomposition.\n\nInvestigators believed Kelsey had been murdered, but they needed more evidence. A closer look at Kelsey and her fianc\u00e9's cell phone activity Thanksgiving weekend would lead them to her suspected killer.\n\nWHERE'S KELSEY?\n\nCHIEF MILES DE YOUNG | WOODLAND PARK POLICE [to reporters]: Patrick Frazee was taken into custody this morning in Florrisant, Colorado, just after 7 o'clock this morning Mountain Standard Time.\n\nNearly a month after Kelsey Berreth vanished, Woodland Park Police Chief Miles De Young made this grim announcement:\n\nCHIEF MILES DE YOUNG [to reporters]: Today we arrested Patrick Frazee on charges of first-degree murder of Kelsey Berreth \u2026 As a reminder Patrick Frazee is presumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\nPatrick Frazee was arrested on charges of first-degree murder in the death of Kelsey Berreth. Her body has not been found. Woodland Park Police Dept.\n\nDespite the murder charge, Kelsey's body had not been found.\n\nCHIEF MILES DE YOUNG [to reporters]: As you can tell from the arrest, sadly, we do not believe Kelsey is still alive. \u2026 Kelsey's daughter Kaylee is in protective custody and will be reunited with Kelsey's family.\n\nFrom the beginning, investigators had questions about Patrick Frazee's story \u2014 starting with his initial claim that the day before Thanksgiving, Kelsey told him she wanted to break up and \"go their separate ways.\"\n\nYet, there she was shopping the next day for the family dinner.\n\nNikki Battiste: And the surveillance video here at Safeway becomes central to this case?\n\nAshley Franco | KKTV reporter: Right \u2026 the last day she's seen publicly.\n\nA surveillance image from November 22, 2018 shows the last time Kelsey Berreth was seen in public. Woodland Park Police Dept.\n\nAshley Franco: Grabs a cart, you see her grab a cart and put Kaylee in the cart and then go off, and that's the last time publicly anyone has seen Kelsey Berreth.\n\nNikki Battiste: What does she buy here at Safeway?\n\nAshley Franco: She buys ingredients for a sweet potato casserole.\n\nInvestigators wondered, if Kelsey had broken up with Frazee why would she send him this text:\n\n\"I bought some sweet potatoes in case you wanted sweet potato casserole ...\"\n\nKelsey didn't tell her mother she and Frazee were breaking up when she spoke with her Thanksgiving morning.\n\nNikki Battiste: Did she sound normal? Did she sound \u2014\n\nCheryl Berreth: Definitely, she sounded happy and \u2014\n\nNikki Battiste Normal mom-daughter talk.\n\nCheryl Berreth: Yeah, yeah.\n\nAnother big question investigators had was when Frazee said he last saw Kelsey.\n\nCHIEF MILES DE YOUNG [to reporters]: Patrick told officers that he hadn't seen her since Thanksgiving, November 22nd when he exchanged their daughter Kaylee Berreth.\n\nFrazee claims that exchange happened outside her home, but he's never said when. Shortly after 1:15 p.m. he is seen on Walmart surveillance with a baby carrier.\n\nPatrick Frazee is seen in a surveillance image at a Walmart at 1:15 p.m. on November 22, 2018. Woodland Park Police Dept.\n\nFifteen minutes later a neighbor's security camera captures an image of Frazee and Kelsey with a baby carrier in front of Kelsey's door. But then, according to authorities, around 3:30 p.m., that same security camera captures an image of \"an individual that matches the physical description of Frazee at Berreth's residence.\"\n\nAya Gruber: We don't know whether if he's coming or going. He doesn't have Kaylee and he's not with Kelsey. And then that's it.\n\nUniversity of Colorado law professor Aya Gruber has read the court filings in this case.\n\nAya Gruber: The critical question is what happened in between around 1:30, 1:45 \u2026 and 3:30 when they get that picture of him.\n\nPolice say this is likely when Frazee killed her:\n\nCHIEF MILES DE YOUNG [to reporters]: \u2026 investigators have recovered a number of items that make us suspicious that the crime did occur at Kelsey's residence.\n\nFrazee told authorities he drove their daughter Kaylee to his ranch for Thanksgiving dinner. He said Kelsey wasn't with them, but investigators discovered that her cell phone was.\n\nAshley Franco: They pulled cell phone records and found that on Thanksgiving Day, November 22, all of a sudden Kelsey's phone and Patrick's phone started traveling together \u2026 But Patrick and Kelsey were not together.\n\nInvestigators say Frazee took Kelsey's cell phone after he killed her as part of a scheme to cover his tracks. They believe he faked 19 calls between the two phones over Thanksgiving weekend and was sending texts between them including this one from Kelsey's phone:\n\nKELSEY BERRETH: I'm going running I'll call you guys when I get home. PATRICK FRAZEE: \"Ok. Be safe\"\n\nAya Gruber: The theory that the prosecution is going to put forward is that that was Patrick with her phone and he's texting, pretending to be Kelsey.\n\nTwo days after Thanksgiving, authorities believe Patrick concocted this conversation:\n\nPATRICK FRAZEE: Are you awake? KELSEY BERRETH: Sorry I didn't hear my phone. Going to jump in the shower. I'll call you guys when I get out. PATRICK FRAZEE: Ok.\n\nThen, investigators believe, to keep up his ruse that Kelsey wanted the breakup, Frazee sent this message:\n\n\"If this is truly what you want, I'll respect your wishes and give you space \u2026\"\n\n\n\nOn Sunday \u2014 three days after Thanksgiving \u2013 there was a bizarre development that would send this case in a very different direction. Phone records show while Frazee's cell stayed near his ranch, Kelsey's phone was on the move \u2013 heading west out of Colorado.\n\nAshley Franco: \u2026 there was a text from Kelsey's phone to her supervisor at Doss Aviation saying \u2026 \"I won't be at work.\" So, people had thought maybe they heard from Kelsey.\n\nThe next text from Kelsey's phone read: \"Do you even love me?\" That text pinged off a cell phone tower 800 miles away.\n\nCHIEF MILES DE YOUNG [to reporters]: Reports are correct that Kelsey's phone gave a location near Gooding, Idaho, on November 25.\n\nAshley Franco: When that came out, I think everyone was \u2014 was just shocked.\n\nNikki Battiste: And where's Kelsey?\n\nAshley Franco: And where's Kelsey? No one knows where Kelsey is.\n\nSo how did her phone end up in Idaho? One woman may have the answer.\n\nA DISTURBING CONVERSATION\n\nIt was startling news when investigators revealed that three days after Kelsey Berreth was last seen, her cell phone had pinged in Gooding, Idaho \u2014 800 miles from her home.\n\nKMVT ANCHOR: Tonight, we have new information about a 32-year-old Twin Falls woman that may have helped Patrick Frazee cover up the disappearance and alleged murder of his fianc\u00e9e, Kelsey Berreth.\n\nAt the time of Kelsey's disappearance, phone records show that Patrick Frazee was in touch with Krystal Kenney Lee \u2014 a nurse and avid horsewoman who grew up here.\n\nNikki Battiste [on horseback]: Is this Krystal's world? Horses, open spaces?\n\nKade Atwood [on horesback]: This is Krystal's world.\n\nKade Atwood is KMVT's news director and a weekend cowboy.\n\nKade Atwood: This is what we do. \u2026 We, in the Magic Valley, we work hard to be able to do this on the weekends.\n\nKade Atwood: Krystal and her family are a big part of the rodeo community. A very prominent family.\n\nMichelle Stein is Lee's best friend. Stein spoke with Nikki Battiste on March 23.\n\nMichelle Stein: You talk horses \u2026 and that's \u2014 you're speaking her love language, you know. \u2026 Horses are her life, she loved horses.\n\nKrystal Kenney Lee\n\nShe was a cowgirl who liked to have fun. And in Idaho, where rodeo rules, Lee was royalty. In 2008, she was crowned queen of the Magic Valley Rodeo.\n\nLaura Stutzman has known Lee since she was a teenager.\n\nLaura Stutzman: Krystal was so kind with everybody that it was just so difficult to turn her down in any way.\n\nNikki Battiste: Krystal had a reputation of getting what she wanted?\n\nLaura Stutzman: No, I wouldn't say it was a reputation of getting what she wanted \u2026 Krystal worked so hard at everything she did to try to do everything completely correct.\n\nAuthorities believed that it was Krystal Lee who travelled to Idaho with Kelsey's phone. But when the FBI made their initial call to Lee, she said she had \"no idea\" who Kelsey Berreth was. She also denied knowing Patrick Frazee. Then, she changed her story.\n\nAshley Franco: They asked her, \"when was the last time you talked to him?\" And she said, \"I don't know. I'd have to look at my phone.\" And then says, \"Oh, in the last month.\" And investigators are thinking, OK, but we already know that your phone has called his phone multiple times in the last few weeks.\n\nAshley Franco: She says, \"I don't have a personal relationship with Patrick Frazee. I've gone to Colorado and looked at a few of his horses, and that's the extent of our relationship.\"\n\nNikki Battiste: She lies.\n\nAshley Franco: She lies.\n\nTurns out Krystal Lee and Patrick Frazee had a long history. They met after high school. Then, eight months before Kelsey disappeared, Lee and Frazee's relationship heated up. Lee was recently divorced with two children.\n\nAshley Franco: She had been out here multiple times to see him and \u2026 it was type \u2026 a type of affair.\n\nNikki Battiste: What did Krystal say about Patrick? Was she in love with him?\n\nMichelle Stein: I think that she was to a point.\n\nNikki Battiste: Were they in a sexual relationship?\n\nMichelle Stein: I don't know \u2026 when she would go to Colorado, it wasn't just to see Patrick. She has family in Colorado.\n\nDuring the investigation, the FBI got a tip that Michelle Stein had explosive information about the case. She says Lee called and confided in her about a disturbing conversation she and Frazee had a month before Kelsey disappeared.\n\nMichelle Stein: She was very, very upset, very distraught \u2026 she had told me \u2026 that he had asked her to \"take care of his baby mama.\"\n\nNikki Battiste: And you took that to mean?\n\nMichelle Stein: And, so, I was like \u2026 Well I was in shock at first because \u2026 who says that? Nobody says that. \u2026 so, I was like. \"Wait, what?\" And she said, \"Yeah \u2026 he asked me if I would kill the mother of his baby.\"\n\nNikki Battiste: What are you thinking at that point?\n\nMichelle Stein: I was just in shock and disbelief \u2026\n\nNikki Battiste: What was Krystal's tone when she was telling you this?\n\nMichelle Stein: She was bawling. She was crying she was extremely upset and scared.\n\nStein says she asked Lee why Frazee wanted to kill Kelsey.\n\nNikki Battiste: What'd she say?\n\nMichelle Stein: And she said that he had told her it was because she wanted to take him back to court to get custody of the baby \u2026 and he was in fear that she was going to harm the baby.\n\nInvestigators found no proof Kelsey had harmed her daughter but did find evidence that Frazee had planned to challenge Kelsey for custody and believe that may have been his motive for murder.\n\nNikki Battiste: Do you regret now not calling the police?\n\nMichelle Stein: Well this is the thing people need to understand. What was I supposed to do?\n\nStein claims she didn't know the full names of either Frazee or Berreth.\n\nMichelle Stein: So, I was supposed to call somewhere in Colorado and say, hey there's some guy in Colorado that wants to kill some girl. I don't know their names and I don't know where they live. But you know good luck finding them. I guess that's what people think I should have done.\n\nStein says she pushed Lee to call the police.\n\nMichelle Stein: This is the thing. \u2026 I kept telling her to call and tell somebody. See, you got to understand, I'm trusting her to do the right thing.\n\nNikki Battiste: But, I think, Michelle, people watching will say \u2026 \"call the police.\" Say, \"you need to talk to my friend. Someone is asking her to kill someone.\"\n\nMichelle Stein: You're right \u2026 Of course the viewers are going to think that.\n\nNikki Battiste: But do you have regret?\n\nMichelle Stein: Of course, I regret it. I regret it every day. Oh, my God. I would do anything to have stopped that somehow.\n\nKelsey had been gone about a month before Stein talked to the FBI. And when the FBI went back at Lee a second time, she too was ready to talk.\n\nAshley Franco: I think at that point she kind of knows, \"I have to come clean.\"\n\nBut first, Lee wanted a deal. In exchange for her testimony against Frazee, she agreed to plead guilty to evidence tampering. She admitted to getting rid of the gun, to tossing Kelsey's keys in a canyon and destroying her phone.\n\nAya Gruber: It's a tampering with evidence charge, which is a minor charge compared to murder, or you know, accessory to murder or attempted murder.\n\nNikki Battiste: She only faces at max, three years in prison.\n\nAya Gruber: This is a pretty good deal that she gets.\n\nWhat Lee revealed to investigators would become the center of the prosecution's case against Patrick Frazee.\n\nPLOTTING A MURDER\n\nWhen Krystal Lee finally started talking, she didn't stop for four-and-a-half hours. Her story was stunning: she claimed Patrick Frazee tried to get her to kill Kelsey Berreth three different times.\n\nNikki Battiste: And the first idea on how to kill Kelsey was what?\n\nAshley Franco: The first idea was to get a Caramel Macchiato from Starbucks, Kelsey's favorite drink and put poison in it.\n\nTwo months before Kelsey went missing, Lee says she drove 12 hours from Idaho to a Starbucks near Kelsey's home in Colorado. Lee, a nurse, told investigators she suggested the perfect potion: a lethal dose of Ambien and Valium.\n\nAya Gruber | University of Colorado law professor: She says \u2026 \"I'll get the drugs. I'll poison the coffee.\"\n\nNikki Battiste: So, Krystal brings this Starbucks Caramel Macchiato right here [to Kelsey's house].\n\nAshley Franco: Waits in the alleyway, walks up to Kelsey's door, knocks on the door, and tells \u2014\n\nNikki Battiste: Kelsey opens it?\n\nAshley Franco: Kelsey opens it, tells Kelsey this elaborate story. She says, \"I'm new to the neighborhood, someone had told me that you had helped get my dogs out of trouble\" \u2026 and Kelsey says, \"no, I didn't do that.\"\n\nNikki Battiste: Does Kelsey take the coffee?\n\nAshley Franco: Allegedly, Kelsey takes the coffee inside and closes the door, and from there we don't \u2014 we don't know what Kelsey does with the coffee.\n\nBut Lee says she couldn't do it. She didn't poison the coffee and when Frazee found out he was angry.\n\nAshley Franco: He was furious. He was not happy \u2026 that she didn't go through with it.\n\nMichelle Stein | Krystal Lee's best friend: He would play head games with her a lot \u2026 he just had a way of manipulating her into doing things.\n\nAfter Lee said she couldn't go through with the poison plan, she told investigators Frazee came up with a different idea.\n\nAshley Franco: He calls her back and says, OK, I'll give you a second chance. You can come out here and I'll give you a new way to \u2014 to kill her.\n\nNikki Battiste: What does he say?\n\nAshley Franco: He says I have a \u2026 metal pipe that I'll leave outside my property that you can come pick up, and I want you to go wait for Kelsey at her townhome. And when she comes, hit her on the back of the head.\n\nThe way Krystal Lee tells it, she drove to Kelsey's house with that metal pipe, but didn't attack her and drove back to Idaho. A week later she says Frazee called with a new murder plan.\n\nOnce again, Lee drove from Idaho to Kelsey's Colorado townhouse.\n\nLee claims she waited for Kelsey outside her home. This time, with an aluminum baseball bat. But just like her earlier attempts, she says she chickened out.\n\nAya Gruber: It's just hard to believe these stories. They seem outlandish and wild.\n\nPhone records show Frazee called Lee in Idaho around 4:30 on Thanksgiving Day. Krystal said he told her, \"You need to get out here now, you got a mess to clean up.\"\n\nAshley Franco: And at that point Krystal knows something has happened to Kelsey.\n\nNikki Battiste: What does Krystal do next?\n\nAshley Franco: Krystal says that she can't come out that same day, but will come out a few days later \u2026 She's in Idaho \u2026 loads up the car with cleaning supplies, bleach, hair nets, you know, gloves, trash bags \u2026\n\nAya Gruber: \u2026 she was so convinced not only it was going to be a murder \u2026 but a bloody one that she basically brought the equivalent of a hazmat suit and every sort of \u2026 cleaning product that one might see in one of those TV shows about how to clean up a crime scene.\n\nTwo days later, on Saturday morning, Lee says she drove 800 miles to Frazee's ranch to pick up a set of Kelsey's keys he left for her outside. Then, she says, she drove to Kelsey's home.\n\nAshley Franco: Krystal tells authorities she opens a door and the scene is horrific. There's blood everywhere. There's bloody footprints \u2026 every inch of the townhome is covered in blood.\n\nAccording to Lee, Kelsey's body was not inside.\n\nAshley Franco: \u2026 and then spends, you know, three to four hours cleaning and scrubbing the murder scene.\n\nNikki Battiste: And she throws away a few items that she says she can't get clean.\n\nAshley Franco: Right, you know \u2026 there's baby toys, there's books \u2026 And she takes some of the things that she couldn't clean and puts them into trash bags and loads them in the back of \u2026 the car she was driving.\n\nLee claims Frazee was back at his ranch during the cleanup.\n\nAshley Franco: There was a point in time when Patrick Frazee had told Krystal Lee, when you go to clean up her townhome, there is possibly a tooth somewhere.\n\nLee said she threw that tooth and a bloody sweater in a trash bag.\n\nAya Gruber: So, one of the things Krystal says is that after she does about three to four hours of cleaning \u2026 she goes and \u2026 gets a Sonic burger.\n\nNikki Battiste: Who goes to get a Sonic burger after cleaning up what she describes as a horrific bloody scene for three to four hours?\n\nAya Gruber: Yeah, that is \u2026 you know just something that feels really unbelievable.\n\nLee told investigators after the cleanup she met with Frazee. She described to them how he said he lured Kelsey to her death. Lee claims Frazee invited his fianc\u00e9e to play a guessing game with candles.\n\nAshley Franco: She says that he takes a sweater from Kelsey's room and blindfolds her with the sweater and has candles sitting out in front of Kelsey and is telling Kelsey to guess the scent of each candle.\n\nDuring her interview with investigators, Lee said Frazee told her while baby Kaylee was in another room, he took a baseball bat and \"he went to swinging.\"\n\nAfter killing Kelsey with that baseball bat on Thanksgiving Day, Lee says Frazee told her he put her body in a black tote. Then, two days later after the cleanup, Lee claims she met Frazee at his ranch and watched him burn that tote.\n\nWhen Lee wrapped up her interview with investigators, she took them to Kelsey's home and pointed out where she claims she intentionally left blood for them to find. Hours later, on December 21, 2018, Frazee was arrested at his ranch and charged with Kelsey Berreth's murder.\n\nAya Gruber: This is a case without a body. This is a case without a lot of physical evidence. So, what we mainly have connecting Patrick Frazee to an incredibly brutal and violent crime\u2026 is Krystal Lee's testimony.\n\n\"So, what this case lives and dies on is the testimony of Krystal Lee. \u2026 That is the connective thread for everything,\" says University of Colorado law professor Aya Gruber. KKTV\n\nLee, who had cut that deal with prosecutors, seemed shaken when she appeared in court after she turned herself in to authorities.\n\nNikki Battiste: Why do you think she did this?\n\nMichelle Stein: I don't know. I\u2026 You do not know the sleepless nights I have had trying to figure that out.\n\nLaura Stutzman | Krystal Lee's friend: The Krystal I knew could do no wrong \u2026 but the Krystal that has done the things that came out of her mouth is somebody I don't know.\n\nAnd that leaves Laura Stutzman with one question: Why?\n\nUNANSWERED QUESTIONS\n\nPatrick Frazee has entered a plea of not guilty and if convicted he could spend the rest of his life in prison.\n\nAshley Franco: I think every time I see him, it's frustrating because he sits there, and he just stares. He doesn't show emotion.\n\nPatrick Frazee faces life in prison for the murder of Kelsey Berreth KKTV\n\nTwo months after his arrest, authorities searched a landfill for Kelsey's remains.\n\nAshley Franco: investigators searched the landfill for weeks and didn't find a thing.\n\nBut investigators did find a potentially damning piece of evidence at Patrick's ranch.\n\nAshley Franco: They are working to test a fragment of a tooth that is just so small. \u2026 They are working to test it for DNA to see who it belongs to. \u2026 And they have been treating this tiny piece of evidence like it is the biggest part of the case.\n\nStill, there are unanswered questions. Initial forensic tests at Kelsey's home revealed some of her blood was mixed with unknown female and male DNA.\n\nAya Gruber: The key is that male DNA did not belong to Patrick Frazee.\n\nNikki Battiste: Do we know whose female DNA that is yet?\n\nAya Gruber: We don't yet.\n\nNikki Battiste: And to this day there is no body and there is no murder weapon. What's that mean for the prosecution?\n\nAya Gruber: I think it makes it a much more difficult case \u2026 The cell phone evidence tells a story. And that's very helpful. But it can't tell a full story. \u2026 So, what this case lives and dies on is the testimony of Krystal Lee. \u2026 That is the connective thread for everything.\n\nAs for Lee, she's not in jail; she's home. She'll be sentenced after Patrick Frazee's trial, but if her story doesn't hold up, that plea deal she got from prosecutors is off the table.\n\nIn the rodeo world, where Lee once reigned, folks live by the cowboy code: It's about honor and trust. Lee broke all the rules.\n\nLaura Stutzman: I think I can speak for a lot of our community here where the ones who knew and loved Krystal with all their heart feel rather betrayed \u2026 There's no sentence imposed by a judge that can actually be more harsh than what her community will put on Krystal.\n\nThose who know her best can't fathom how it came to this.\n\nLaura Stutzman: Why is the question that everybody has. Why? Krystal had it all. She had it all.\n\nInvestigators said that Lee told them she loved Frazee and wanted to please him, but there was something else. She was afraid that Frazee might harm her family.\n\nMichelle Stein: She had a legitimate fear for her life here. \u2026 He did a lot of threatening. He threatened Krystal a lot. He threatened Krystal's daughter.\n\nNikki Battiste: How?\n\nMichelle Stein: I'm not exactly sure the specifics of how he threatened her, but he did say, \"little girls come up missing all the time.\"\n\nProsecutors are counting on Lee's story to convict Frazee of murder. But his defense team has already pointed the finger right back at the former rodeo queen, suggesting Lee fabricated portions of her story, or may herself have been involved in Kelsey's murder.\n\nNikki Battiste: Is Krystal believable?\n\nAshley Franco: It's hard to say because we know she lied to investigators the first time they talked to her. \u2026 we don't know if she's being truthful.\n\nPatrick Frazee's friend Clint Cline is reluctant to speculate.\n\nClint Cline: His life's been turned upside down. Guilty or innocent, it's been turned upside down.\n\nNikki Battiste: What's the big question on your mind?\n\nClint Cline: I think a lot of people are wonderin' if they got the right person in jail.\n\nPatrick Frazee remains under tight security while he awaits trial for Kelsey's murder. Their 2-year-old daughter is being raised by Kelsey's parents.\n\nKelsey Berreth Clint Berreth\n\nFriends say nothing can bring Kelsey back, but they will always be there for her daughter.\n\nAshley Cogburn: I think I would tell her, you know, if you ever feel yourself being driven or shy, a little feisty or playful just know that that's your mother coming through.\n\nAshley Cogburn: \u2026 I can't tell you how many times I see an airplane flying by \u2026 and wonder \u2026 if that's Kelsey up there.\n\nAshley Cogburn: She had her wings down here and she was an earthly angel \u2026 and now she'll have real angel wings, heavenly angel wings.\n\nPatrick Frazee's trial is scheduled to begin October 28", "description": "Not long after Kelsey Berreth disappeared last Thanksgiving, one woman told a wild story that would lead to a huge break in the case -- and Berreth's fianc\u00e9 being charged in her death", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/04/5a0f5581-41de-4c39-bfa1-014fda5b90d4/thumbnail/1200x630/8a5d36118be8ad8841dd03533be50e9c/krystal-lee-hero.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
