People are being murdered by war weapons that they legally purchase. This is just not normal. That should never, ever be normal,\u201d said the Grammy winner.\n\n\u201cAnd the fact that it\u2019s classified as something different because of the colour of their skin? It\u2019s a slap in the face. It\u2019s completely racist.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cPut an Arab man with that same weapon in that same Walmart and there is no way that Trump would sit there and address it publicly as a mental health problem. The most mentally ill human being in America right now seems to be the president.\u201d\n\nIt is possible the singer\u2019s comments will themselves spark outcry.\n\nBoth gun control and mental health advocates have pointed out that while politicians often blame mental health for mass shootings, there is little evidence that mentally ill people are responsible for such acts. Some may feel she was similarly wrong to parcel mentally ill people together with the president.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump again failed America by pushing dangerous and long-disproven narratives about the roots of gun violence, parroting NRA talking points, rather than citing the common-sense and evidence-based solutions we know will bring an end to gun violence,\u201d Kris Brown, president of the gun control group Brady, said after Mr Trump\u2019s comments in August.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear the president dangerously misrepresents a relationship between mental health and gun violence. Mental illness is not predictive of violence. In fact, studies prove the opposite is true: those living with mental illnesses are more likely to be victims rather than perpetrators of violence.\u201d\n\nAsked during the interview what advice she may have for immigrants to the country, Rihanna, who is originally from Barbados, said: \u201cWhat do you say? What can you say? It\u2019s gonna get better? I almost feel sick to my stomach. I don\u2019t even believe this is happening in real life.\n\n\u201cIn front of my eyes. In front of the world. It\u2019s not even hidden. This is blatant.\u201d\n\nShe also confirmed reports that she had turned down the National Football League\u2019s offer to perform at the Super Bowl half-time show in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick.\n\nKaepernick, who has not played in the NFL since 2017, sparked controversy began kneeling in protest of racial discrimination and injustice at the US national anthem was played before games.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t dare do that. For what? Who gains from that,\u201d she said. \u201cNot my people. I just couldn\u2019t be a sellout. I couldn\u2019t be an enabler.\u201d", "description": "Rihanna has launched a scathing attack on Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to address gun violence, suggesting he may be \u201cthe most mentally ill human being in America\u201d.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/05/30/14/rihanna-main.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
