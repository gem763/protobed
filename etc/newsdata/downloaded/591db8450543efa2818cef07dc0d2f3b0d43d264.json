When you don't win, not only at Tottenham, this happens at every club in the world.\n\n'It is normal that the game has created a lot of opinion and rumours, everyone needs to talk.\n\n'But in the end, the only thing that happened is that we lost a game. I have no doubt we are going to stay together and find a way to be successful again, no doubt.\n\n'In five-and-a-half years, every single press conference we have talked about my future.\n\n'I hope [because] we are still talking, it means that I am going to spend five more years here, at least.'\n\nThis story is from Matt Hughes's 'AHEAD OF THE GAME' column, which you can read about here - REVEALED: Black players feel Raheem Sterling's public defence of Bernardo Silva over his 'racist tweets' missed the target\u2026 but there is an awareness that the Manchester City star is in an awkward position", "description": "The Argentine has appeared increasingly detached from his players at the start of this campaign and, as Sportsmail revealed, often stays inside to monitor training remotely.", "authors": ["Matt Hughes For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/21/19314598-0-image-a-117_1570220989573.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
