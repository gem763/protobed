Not surprisingly, given Trump\u2019s inclinations, the news came in a tweet posted by the president on Wednesday morning: \u201cWe have defeated ISIS on Syria,\u201d Trump announced, \u201cmy only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.\u201d U.S. officials later said that all U.S. troops would be removed from Syria over the next 60 to 100 days.\n\nWhile the announcement took much of official Washington by surprise, The American Conservative has learned that a select group of administration officials, as well as a handful of senior military officers, knew of Trump\u2019s decision as early as Saturday morning. According to these officials, all of whom required anonymity in exchange for the information, Trump\u2019s decision came as a result of a lengthy telephone exchange he had had with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday. Everything that Trump announced today, we have been told, was decided in that call.\n\nThat telephone discussion, as one of these officials told us, was the latest in \u201ca series of conversations the two have had over the last weeks on a host of issues,\u201d including the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Erdogan\u2019s insistence that the U.S. extradite cleric Fethullah Gulen to Turkey, U.S. worries about Iranian meddling in the region\u2014and continuing U.S. support for Kurdish forces operating in Syria (led by the People Protection Units\u2014the YPG), which Turkey views as a terrorist organization. It was this last issue that was the focus of Friday\u2019s telephone call, spurred by Erdogan\u2019s public pledge 48 hours earlier that he was prepared to order his military into Syria to take on the YPG despite U.S. backing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe will begin our operation to free the east of the Euphrates [river] from the separatist organization within a few days,\u201d Erdogan had said on Wednesday. \u201cOur target is not American soldiers, it is the terror organizations that are active in the region.\u201d\n\nDuring Friday\u2019s telephone call, Erdogan once again took a hard line against the Kurds, and the administration\u2019s support for them. A part of his argument was that the U.S. had said it was allying with the Kurds to destroy ISIS which, as Erdogan argued, had been accomplished. Nor was Erdogan influenced by Trump\u2019s contention that the U.S. needed to remain in Syria in order to check Iranian influence in the region. Erdogan, we have been told, was ready for the argument: the best hedge against Iran, he told Trump, was not the Kurds, or even the Saudis, but Turkey.\n\nErdogan, as it turns out, wasn\u2019t the only one making that argument. As reported in these pages last April, senior U.S. military officers, including Gen. Curtis Michael \u201cMike\u201d Scaparrotti (the highly respected head of the U.S. European Command), warned that the U.S. \u201cmarriage of convenience\u201d with the YPG in its fight against ISIS in Syria was poisoning its relationship with Turkey\u2014a NATO ally. Turkey, as Scaparrotti told James Mattis in March, was particularly angry that the U.S. was supporting the YPG\u2019s deployment to Manbij, threatening Turkish forces some 70 miles away. So what is more important, Scaparrotti asked Mattis, our relationship with the Kurds, or our relationship with Turkey? Gen. Jospeh Votel, the head of Centcom, pushed back against Scaparrotti, saying that America\u2019s \u201cmarriage of convenience\u201d was \u201ctemporary, tactical and transactional\u201d and essential to defeating ISIS.\n\nAnd so it was that the Scaparrotti-Votel debate was both postponed (with the administration supporting Votel\u2019s position until ISIS could be decisively defeated) and papered over\u2014with Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issuing regular reassurances to Turkey that the U.S.-YPG relationship was only temporary. Now, with Trump\u2019s decision, the debate has been resolved. \u201cSomewhere, you can bet, Joe Votel is absolutely spinning his head into the ceiling,\u201d a senior military officer told me. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to call this\u2014but it sounds like Scaparrotti\u2019s revenge.\u201d Perhaps, but for Syria experts and for those in the military who supported Votel\u2019s position, while Trump\u2019s decision on a full U.S. withdrawal came as a surprise, it might have been predicted.\n\n\u201cYes, I was surprised,\u201d Joshua Landis, the head of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, says, \u201cbut I suppose I should not have been. After all, we could see this coming. Our relationship with Turkey is much, much more important than our relationship with the Kurds. Then too, if the Trump administration wants to pin Iran\u2019s ears back in the region, it\u2019s not Kurds, or the Saudis or the Emiratis who are going to do it. It\u2019s the Turks.\u201d\n\nJohn Allen Gay, an Iran expert and executive director of the John Quincy Adams Society, agrees. He argues that Trump\u2019s decision confirms what everyone has quietly admitted for at least the past year: that keeping U.S. forces in Syria to counter ISIS was starting to look like a way for administration interventionists to argue that we should take on Iran.\n\n\u201cKeeping the troops there post-ISIS was in part natural mission creep, but it was also a stalking horse for hawks in the administration who want to take on Iran,\u201d he told TAC.\n\n\u201cYet dangling a few thousand guys in between Turkish forces on one side and Iranians, Russians, and Syrians on the other was never going to be decisive on Iran\u2019s regional role, and it came with real risks and no endgame,\u201d Gay added. \u201cI just don\u2019t think there\u2019s any appetite in the American public for a big fight with Iran anywhere, let alone over Eastern Syria.\u201d\n\nGay may well be right, at least according to a number of U.S. military officers with whom we\u2019ve talked.\n\n\u201cWe need a respite,\u201d a senior military officer told us in the wake of the Trump decision, \u201cand that\u2019s especially true for the Air Force. Those guys have been in the air over the Middle East since Operation Enduring Freedom, back in 2001. These guys are running on fumes.\u201d\n\nNor, as we\u2019ve been told, are senior military officers concerned that the announced U.S. withdrawal from Syria gives Putin a victory. \u201cComplete and absolute nonsense,\u201d a very senior officer who served multiple tours in the region told us. \u201cI hate to put it this way, but I think it\u2019s true. We can\u2019t repair Syria\u2014and it\u2019s not our job to do it. If Putin wants to inherit it, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nWhich is not to say that Trump\u2019s decision has been greeted unanimously. In the wake of his Friday decision, the administration\u2019s foreign policy triumvirate of James Mattis, John Bolton, and Mike Pompeo pushed back, arguing that keeping U.S. troops in Syria was essential, if for no other reason than to keep a high U.S. profile in the region. Their arguments were predictable, if outspoken: ISIS isn\u2019t really defeated, Iran is on the march, the U.S. needs to show solidarity with its Kurdish allies.\n\nTrump, channeling Erdogan, pushed back on each of them\u2014ISIS is finished, Iran could be countered in other ways and, as Erdogan had told him, the Kurds were already talking with the Assad government about an accommodation that would keep them in northeastern Syria. In truth, as we were told by a senior Turkish diplomat who was privy to the Trump-Erdogan exchange, the decision had been made on Friday, when Trump told Erdogan that he agreed that the U.S. could withdraw its troops from Syria. When can you do that? Erdogan had asked. Trump wasn\u2019t sure, so he turned to his national security adviser, who was listening in on the conversation.\n\nCan we do it today? Now? Trump asked. Bolton nodded: \u201cYes,\u201d he said.\n\nMark Perry is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and the author of The Pentagon\u2019s Wars.
