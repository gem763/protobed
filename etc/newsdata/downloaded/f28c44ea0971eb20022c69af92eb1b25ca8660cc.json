In a little-reported addendum to the Mississippi actions, ICE also reached into North Carolina, arresting five workers on the same day at Morganton\u2019s Case Farms plant\u2014one of whom was Jos\u00e9 Samuel Solis Lopez.\n\nThese days, we hear a lot about the \u201cborder crisis,\u201d Trump\u2019s wall, and the politics of immigration reform, but too seldom do we see the stories behind the headlines.\n\nI first met Jos\u00e9 in 1997 while researching the history of a labor struggle in which he had been intimately involved over the previous few years. From 1993 to 2001, the largely immigrant and predominantly Guatemalan Maya workforce at Case Farms had regularly protested against a factory regime that paid them little respect as human beings. Low wages, the speed of the processing lines, denial of bathroom breaks, and arbitrary dismissals were precipitating issues in a recurrent set of strikes. Yet, try as they might, the workers, whose few local allies included the Legal Services office and Morganton\u2019s St. Charles Catholic Church as well as the Laborers\u2019 International Union, never overcame the hostility of Case Farms\u2019 management. Indeed, the chief sources of grievances continue to this day. An investigation by Oxfam America cited lack of bathroom breaks as a major complaint as late as 2015, and the company was also singled out in a 2017 New Yorker expos\u00e9 of \u201cexploitation and abuse at the chicken plant.\u201d\n\nIt took a special kind of courage for a rank newcomer like 26-year-old-Jos\u00e9 to step into the leadership of the incipient rebellion at the 500-person factory in 1993, but it was courage that had already been nurtured by strong family commitments to community service. His uncles had once managed a thriving garlic and onion cooperative in Aguacatan, an indigenous, linguistically isolated village perched high in the mountains of western Guatemala. With his family\u2019s resources, Jose had enjoyed several years of schooling in Guatemala City and looked forward to a future career as a teacher. By the mid-1980s, however, a deepening civil war and growing economic straits totally upended village life and sent thousands to find work in the U.S. After picking crops across the Northwest and Florida, one uncle found stable employment in Morganton\u2019s poultry plant, and Jose followed a few years later.\n\nLike his uncle, Jos\u00e9 qualified for a U.S. work permit under an interpretation of the Refugee Act of 1980 and a subsequent special window for Guatemalans and Salvadorans created by a court ruling in 1991. He soon emerged as a leader of the young activists sustaining the Case Farms protests. Within the Spanish-speaking rank-and-file committee meeting regularly at St. Charles Church, he connected his own experience to a wider struggle:\n\n\u201cDemocracy is a good thing,\u201d he said of his disaffection from the government of his native country, \u201cbut there is not democracy in the Central American states. [Democracy means] to live free, work tranquilly, to have work and enough salary to live.\u201d\n\nYet he exulted in the new workplace leadership of his fellow Aguacatecos: \u201cwe [Aguacatecos] are all united, no one is left behind.\u201d In that spirit he also served as secretary of the directiva , effectively a burial association formed to raise money for the transplantation of bodies of deceased workers back to Aguacatan as well for the sustenance of young family members with deceased parents.\n\nAside from birth and residency criteria, the Cambridge English Dictionary defines citizenship as \u201cthe state of living in a particular area or town and behaving in a way that other people who live there expect of you\u201d and also as \u201ccarrying out the duties and responsibilities of a member of a particular society.\u201d\n\nBy these measures, Jos\u00e9 proved a model citizen. He worked hard, paid his taxes, and took care of himself and his family, even managing to send two daughters to college. Moreover, in a situation of great adversity and high personal risk, he stepped forward to defend the rights and advance the welfare of the community around him; he continued to serve as secretary of the Aguacateco directiva. He neither expected nor asked much of his adopted country\u2014basically just the chance to earn a paycheck and be free from government and employer intimidation.\n\nYet, like many would-be refugees from Central America in the 1990s (and again today), Jos\u00e9 had never secured a legal certification of U.S. citizenship. By 1997, the legal window for Guatemalans and Salvadorans had closed before Jose could establish permanent status. He stayed on even after an initial deportation order in 1996 but never tried to \u2018disappear\u2019 by inventing a new name and identity. Jose was thus an easy target for an administration that wanted to make an example of the millions of workers in the U.S. without good papers.\n\nAs if to justify the recent ICE sweeps, this week President Trump told a crowd in Fayetteville, \u201cNorth Carolina has released thousands of dangerous criminal aliens into your communities and you see it. The charges against these free criminals include sexual assault, robbery, drug crimes and homicide. Murder!\u201d\n\nAs part of the collateral damage of such immigrant fearmongering, Jos\u00e9, now 52 and suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure, has been sitting, awaiting deportation, in the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia.\n\nIn the conclusion to my 2003 book, The Maya of Morganton, I wrote: \u201cIt is common to talk about immigrants and the American Dream as if the latter were something that U.S. citizens already possess and others have to strive for. Yet, when it comes to the prospects for American democracy at the dawn of a new century, the welfare of new immigrant labor forces will likely tell us as much about our own dreams as about theirs.\u201d\n\nAs Jos\u00e9\u2019s story underscores, the verdict is in. When it comes to immigration, the remains of our dreams are bathed in tears.", "description": "He neither expected nor asked much of his adopted country\u2014basically just the chance to earn a paycheck and be free from government and employer intimidation.", "authors": ["Leon Fink"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_266,w_473,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568576710/Screen_Shot_2019-09-13_at_4.33.32_PM_cfofg4", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
