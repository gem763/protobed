The company said last week in a statement it\u2019s carrying out a \u201ccomprehensive strategic review.\u201d\n\nThe Kenai plant is among \u201cseveral logical non-core\u201d assets flagged for sale by Elliott in a presentation published last month. The investor is also demanding the breakup of Marathon into three segments -- refining, midstream and retail -- which it says would unlock more than $22 billion in value.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much the two plants might fetch in a sale. In May, Chevron Corp. bought the Pasadena refinery, which has a 110,000-barrel-per-day capacity, for $350 million.\n\nHedge fund D.E. Shaw & Co. has also been pushing the refiner to explore ways to unlock value. Marathon investors Paul Foster and Jeff Stevens have called for the ouster of Chief Executive Officer Gary Heminger. Marathon met with all three activists last week to discuss Heminger\u2019s future and the company\u2019s strategy.\n\nMarathon is due to report its third-quarter earnings and hold a conference call with analysts and investors on Oct. 31.\n\nShares of the company were 1.1% higher at $65.36 at 11:20 a.m. in New York.\n\n(Updates with share price in last paragraph)\n\n--With assistance from David Wethe.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Catherine Ngai in New York at cngai16@bloomberg.net;Kiel Porter in Chicago at kporter17@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Simon Casey at scasey4@bloomberg.net, Christine Buurma\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Marathon Petroleum Corp., the U.S. oil refiner under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management Corp. to break itself up, is weighing the sale of two plants in Alaska and Utah, according to people familiar with the matter.The Findlay, Ohio-based company is in active discussions", "authors": ["Catherine Ngai", "Kiel Porter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
