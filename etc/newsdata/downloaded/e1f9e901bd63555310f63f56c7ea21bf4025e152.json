But, unlike those other states, which have overwhelmingly conservative governments, Michigan could pass antiabortion laws without the governor\u2019s approval and without the support of a majority of voters.\n\nIf that happens, the legion of petitioners won\u2019t be the only reason. Abortion rights advocates could also point the finger at a familiar specter: gerrymandering.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Michigan, as elsewhere, the sparring over access to abortion spans local politics, the state judiciary and federal courts. On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court gave Republicans a victory when it threw out a lower court\u2019s ruling that the state\u2019s political district maps were illegally gerrymandered \u2014 reaffirming the high court\u2019s stance that federal judges have no power to stop partisan gerrymandering.\n\nAt the same time, Michigan\u2019s recently elected Democratic governor has promised to veto antiabortion bills passed in the GOP-dominated House and Senate.\n\nHowever, an obscure but long-standing provision in the state constitution gives the state\u2019s citizens the chance to work hand-in-hand with the legislature to pass bills that are exempt from a governor\u2019s veto or a popular vote.\n\nAD\n\nThat provision, known as the indirect initiative process, gives antiabortion groups a way to push for new bans on the procedure, and it puts ultimate power back in the hands of Republican lawmakers, who critics say are not representative of the state\u2019s current, mostly Democratic electorate. Under the process, petitioners who collect a certain number of signatures from voters could force the passage of a law with a simple majority vote in the statehouse.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clever but it\u2019s deeply undemocratic,\u201d said Nicholas Stephanopoulos, the University of Chicago law professor who created the efficiency gap, a method for measuring partisan gerrymandering. \u201cThrough this loophole, they\u2019re still able to pass laws as though the gubernatorial election never happened.\u201d\n\nGerrymandering, in others words, can have an even more profound effect in Michigan.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s happening elsewhere, too. The age-old practice of hyperpartisan redistricting, experts say, has led to more-extreme laws countrywide \u2014 none more visible this year than those dealing with abortion. In 2019, 12 largely conservative states have restricted access to abortions, while six liberal states have expanded or protected such access.\n\nBut to really grasp the impact that gerrymandering has had on abortion laws, you have to look back to 2010, said Dan Vicu\u00f1a, the national redistricting manager at voting rights watchdog group Common Cause. That election year, Republicans set out to win control of as many statehouses as possible, which gave them power to redraw state and congressional districts after the census.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat effort succeeded beyond their wildest dreams,\u201d Vicu\u00f1a said. \u201cRepublicans took over tons of state legislatures, and they were interested in gerrymandering.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSince then, he said, it\u2019s no surprise that the number of abortion bans passed at the state level has exploded.\n\nFrom 1973 through 2010, states passed nine laws seeking to ban abortion outright or to prevent it after a certain point of pregnancy, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research and advocacy organization. But from 2011 to today, that number has nearly tripled. States have passed more abortion bans in 2019 alone than in the nearly 40 years before the 2010 election.\n\n\u201cThey will take the power they have and use it,\u201d said Michelle Kuppersmith, the director of the abortion rights advocacy group Equity Forward. \u201cThey\u2019re good at this. \u2026 They have an advantage in the gerrymandered legislatures and they\u2019re using it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOf the dozen states to enact stricter abortion laws this year, at least half have districts that skew unfairly in Republicans\u2019 favor, according to PlanScore, a nonpartisan mapping tool Stephanopoulos helped develop. PlanScore compares the numbers of Democrats and Republicans in the states and determines which states have legislatures that are unrepresentative of their electorates.\n\nOf the six states to protect abortion rights, Vermont is the only one with a map that PlanScore says skews Democratic. Illinois, where Republicans have for years argued that districts are stacked against them, also passed protections for the procedure.\n\nFor Michigan, Stephanopoulos says his research shows Republicans have enjoyed a particularly profound advantage. Democrats consistently win the majority of the statewide vote but lose the legislature. He says it\u2019s happened in every election since the state\u2019s Republican governor approved the Republican-backed redistricting plan in 2011.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMichigan is awful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the handful of the most gerrymandered legislatures in the country.\u201d\n\nIt happened again in 2018, when Democratic candidates won 54 percent of votes statewide but still ended up as a minority in the Michigan House \u2014 making it the only state in the country with both an \u201canti-majoritarian\u201d legislature and an indirect initiative law, an analysis from the Princeton Gerrymandering Project showed.\n\nNow antiabortion groups are on the verge of resurrecting two bills that passed in the House and Senate but stalled when Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) threatened to veto them. If the groups\u2019 dual petition drives are successful, those bills \u2014 bans on the dilation-and-evacuation procedure and on abortion after six weeks \u2014 would become law after legislators pass them with a simple majority.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe six-week ban, backed by the Michigan Heartbeat Coalition, is similar to others championed by conservatives in Ohio, Mississippi, Kentucky and elsewhere, and would ban the procedure before some women even know they\u2019re pregnant. Courts have agreed that such bans are unconstitutional, and abortion rights advocates have called the effort a coordinated plot to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortions nationwide.\n\nRepresentatives of the Heartbeat Coalition didn\u2019t respond to an interview request, but on group\u2019s website, its president said he hopes the bill will be \u201cthe arrow in the heart of Roe v. Wade.\u201d\n\nRight to Life of Michigan, a local affiliate of the antiabortion group National Right to Life, is behind the other petition \u2014 a ban on dilation-and-evacuation abortions, the most common procedure used during the second trimester of pregnancy. The organization\u2019s strategists have been here before. They\u2019ve used the indirect initiative process to enact into law four bills that ran afoul of a governor\u2019s veto.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are the most successful organization in the state\u2019s history of doing this,\u201d said Genevieve Marnon, the legislative director at Right to Life of Michigan.\n\nSince 1987, the group has used this method to pass a ban on the use of public funds to pay for the abortions of welfare recipients, a requirement that minors get parental consent before having abortions, new legal protections for fetuses and, in 2013, a requirement that women purchase extra insurance if they want abortion included in their health-care coverage.\n\nMarnon rejected criticism that her group\u2019s petition drives are undemocratic.\n\n\u201cThe process is the same for everyone,\u201d Marnon said. \u201cAll of a sudden they\u2019re crying foul because Right to Life Michigan is doing something they don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nAnd if a gerrymandered legislature means lawmakers\u2019 votes don\u2019t count, she argued, then \u201care we just going to do away with every law that\u2019s been passed?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe indirect initiative process requires petitioners to gather the signatures of at least 8 percent of the number of people who voted in the most recent gubernatorial election \u2014 or, in this case, about 340,000 registered voters out of a population of roughly 10 million people. As of Sept. 30, Right to Life said it had gathered 200,000 signatures.\n\nOnce the initiative gets back to the statehouse, lawmakers have three options: They can reject it, which will send it to the ballot for a popular vote; they can propose an alternative, in which case both will go to the ballot and whichever receives more votes will become law; or they can pass it without amendments.\n\nMarnon is confident that lawmakers, who have already supported the legislation, will do so again, bypassing Whitmer\u2019s veto.\n\nMarnon bristles at those who say Right to Life is circumventing the will of the majority of voters who elected Whitmer. Instead, she said, Whitmer\u2019s promised veto would undermine the power of the legislators.\n\nEach side of the debate has staked its claim to the majority opinion. Marnon said people are more likely to oppose abortion if they first read a detailed description of the dilation-and-evacuation method, which antiabortion groups call \u201cdismemberment abortions.\u201d\n\nHowever, abortion rights advocates argue that lawmakers and the thousands of petition-signing citizens represent a minority of the state\u2019s population. And polling indicates that most of the state\u2019s likely voters want abortion legal in most or all cases.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in Michigan is nothing more than tyranny by the minority,\u201d Kuppersmith said. \u201cA clear majority of Michiganders are pro-choice, and the minority is pulling out every stop to impose its fringe views on the state.\u201d\n\nMichigan\u2019s constitution is, as lawyers say, \u201cclose to the people.\u201d Its citizen-led indirect initiative process has also long allowed liberal groups to force their causes onto the ballot without the blessing of Republican-controlled legislatures. The difference, Democrats have said, is that when lawmakers reject the proposals, the majority of voters then have a chance to decide.\n\nIn 2018, Michiganders approved three initiatives this way. They legalized recreational use of marijuana and enacted voting policies, including same-day registration.\n\nThey also did something that could fundamentally reshape the architecture of the state legislature: Voters transferred the power to draw legislative and congressional boundaries from state lawmakers to an independent redistricting commission \u2014 a constitutional amendment that Michigan Republicans have since tried to block in court.", "description": "In Michigan, a Supreme Court ruling and an obscure law could help antiabortion groups pass more restrictions without the Democratic governor or a popular vote.", "authors": ["Reis Thebault", "National", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nBJLR2DwNr85Uw4QhpXWgtIpAaI=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/05-07-2019/t_ce6fb86789794ad794215659f1171c05_name_1___1920x1080___30p_00_01_49_15_Still016.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
