Unlike in Britain, where I was born, and the United States, where I grew up, the citizens of my adopted home have been encouraged by their distinctive traditional culture to be quiet, to remain invisible, to try to look and sound like everyone else. The one thing others don\u2019t much need, they know, is the loud impress of personality. Since I\u2019d been trained to babble, I thought, when choosing to move to Japan, that it might be a good thing to go somewhere where I could learn to listen. Since I\u2019d been encouraged at school to try to be an individual, it didn\u2019t seem a terrible thing to learn to be quite typical. Becoming myself, I realized, might not involve anything more than becoming more like everyone around me.\n\nWhen I met the woman who would become my wife in a Kyoto temple three weeks after I arrived in 1987, of course it was everything that I assumed to be distinctive, unique, even foreign in her that pulled me, much as she was surely drawn by the foreignness in me. But as we pass into a deeper season in our lives, we come to see that the season\u2019s special lesson is to cherish everything because it cannot last; from Vermont to Beijing, people relish autumn days precisely because they\u2019re reminders of how much we cannot afford to take for granted, and how much there is to celebrate right now, this shining late September afternoon.\n\nI could have learned this anywhere, no doubt, but in Japan the seasons are treated with the sort of passion and reverence usually associated with religion. Every time the cherries begin to blossom, people flock into the parks because, in 10 days or so, the frothing pink flowers will be gone; and every time the maple leaves blaze in late November, my Japanese friends and family throng into temple gardens in much the same spirit that people of any faith may gather in temples or cathedrals. To be joined in a congregation; to be reminded of something larger than ourselves, keeping us in place; to catch moments of light in a season of mounting darkness.\n\nI love the sunshine when I visit my mother in Southern California, but I can\u2019t say I love the fact that February and August are growing interchangeable. It\u2019s the end of things, Japan has taught me, that gives them their savor and their beauty. And it\u2019s the fact that my wife \u2014 and I \u2014 are always changing, even as we\u2019re shedding leaves and hair, that confers an urgency on my feelings toward her. Every year the autumn reminds me that progress doesn\u2019t move in a straight line and that I\u2019m not necessarily wiser than I was last year \u2014 or 30 years ago. Every year, autumn sings the same tune, but to a different audience.\n\nMy first year in Japan, I wrote a book about my enraptured discovery of a love, a life and a culture that I hoped would be mine forever. My publishers brought out my celebration of springtime romance in autumn. Now, 28 years on, I\u2019m more enamored of the fall, if only because it has spring inside it, and memories, and the acute awareness that almost nothing lasts forever. Every day in autumn \u2014 a cyclical sense of things reminds us \u2014 brings us a little bit closer to the spring.\n\nPico Iyer is the author of \u201cAutumn Light\u201d and, most recently, \u201cA Beginner\u2019s Guide to Japan.\u201d\n\nNow in print: \u201cThe Stone Reader: Modern Philosophy in 133 Arguments\u201d and \u201cModern Ethics in 77 Arguments,\u201d with essays from the series, edited by Peter Catapano and Simon Critchley, published by Liveright Books.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
