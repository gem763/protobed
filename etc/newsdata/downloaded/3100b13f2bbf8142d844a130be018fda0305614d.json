(AP) - North Carolina State coach Kevin Keatts is trying to keep the focus on what happens on the basketball court and not a suspension or the ongoing NCAA infractions case swirling around the program.\n\nThere is no end in sight for the balancing act.\n\nNot with the indefinite suspension of D.J. Funderburk for violating team policy. Then there are NCAA charges against the program from before Keatts\u2019 arrival that are tied to the federal corruption investigation into college basketball. There is no timetable for a resolution in that case, which must wind its way through the infractions system.\n\n\u201cFrom a recruiting standpoint, it\u2019s been a little bit of a challenge,\u201d Keatts said Thursday of the NCAA case during the Wolfpack\u2019s preseason media day. \u201cAs you know in basketball or any sport, any time of your competitors can use something that may happen or may not happen against you, then they do.\n\n\u201cFrom our standpoint, we really have just focused on these guys and how successful we can be. Honestly we don\u2019t even talk about it.\u201d\n\nKeatts has generally declined to discuss the NCAA case, which was rooted in a criminal probe involving improper payments to recruits and their families, as well as apparel company Adidas. That case has impacted numerous programs across the country, though only N.C. State and Kansas have said they have received a Notice of Allegations (NOA) from the NCAA outlining charges.\n\nThe NCAA charged N.C. State in July with four violations, including potential top-level counts against former head coach Mark Gottfried and former assistant coach Orlando Early tied to guard Dennis Smith Jr., who played one season for the Wolfpack before leaving for the NBA.\n\nKeatts took over for Gottfried in spring 2017, a few months before the federal investigation became public, and no member of the current staff is accused of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cNone of us were here during that time, and obviously it doesn\u2019t really affect us because it wasn\u2019t us,\u201d said Pat Andree, a graduate transfer from Lehigh. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be around and we\u2019re going to hear it a lot, but we\u2019ve just got to control what we can control.\u201d\n\nN.C. State was originally due to submit its response to the NCAA charges Monday, though the NCAA has since suspended filing deadlines in all cases related to the FBI probe until after Nov. 20. Keatts said he has left the NCAA case to school compliance staffers and attorneys, and that the team\u2019s focus has been solely on basketball.\n\nJunior guard Braxton Beverly agreed, even while acknowledging the case has been \u201call over the news so it\u2019s kind of hard to completely avoid.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat stuff predates this team, this staff, everybody that\u2019s here right now,\u201d Beverly said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we were caught up in it. Right now, we\u2019re just focused on us. I can\u2019t speak for everybody else to say they don\u2019t ever think about it. But it\u2019s not something that we just dwell on or try to make sense out of.\u201d\n\nWhile the NCAA case is likely months from resolution, this week\u2019s suspension of Funderburk has the potential to more directly impact the Wolfpack on the court this season.\n\nThe 6-foot-10, 225-pound redshirt junior was set to earn significant minutes as the team\u2019s top option up front. He averaged 8.8 points and 4.2 rebounds while shooting 55% in roughly 20 minutes of action as a reserve last season, while his length allowed him to block a team-high 38 shots.\n\nKeatts wouldn\u2019t go into specifics into what prompted the suspension beyond saying Funderburk hasn\u2019t met Keatts\u2019 \u201ccertain expectation of what I think an N.C. State player should be.\u201d\n\nN.C. State has added graduate-transfer help up front with the 6-8 Andree from Lehigh and 6-10 Danny Dixon from UMKC. The Wolfpack will also have 6-11 redshirt freshman Manny Bates after he missed last year with a shoulder injury.\n\nKeatts said there was no timetable for when Funderburk might return to team-related activities.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got some benchmarks that I want him to meet to be able to join the team, and when that happens, he\u2019ll be a part of it,\u201d Keatts said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, he won\u2019t.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at https://twitter.com/aaronbeardap\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "North Carolina State coach Kevin Keatts is trying to keep the focus on what happens on the basketball court and not a suspension or the ongoing NCAA infractions case swirling around the program.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Aaron Beard"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/nc_state_offcourt_concerns_basketball_96772_c0-63-2517-1530_s1770x1032.jpg?e4878ffe5ebb2136fafd7401bd8eec162eef1836"}
