This is un-American,\u201d Graham said to reporters.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a situation in my lifetime as a lawyer where somebody is accused of a major misconduct who cannot confront the accuser, call witnesses on her behalf and have the discussion in the light of day so the public can judge,\u201d he said.\n\nGraham made his comments after Trump caused a firestorm by tweeting that the House impeachment inquiry is a \u201clynching.\u201d\n\nGraham backed up the president, saying, \u201cI think that\u2019s pretty well accurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think lynching is being seen as somebody taking the law in their own hands and out to get somebody for no good reason,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if he could understand why African Americans would be offended by the comparison, Graham stood his ground.\n\n\u201cYes, African Americans have [been] lynched. Other people have been lynched throughout history. What does lynching mean? That a mob grabs you, they don\u2019t give you a chance to defend yourself, they don\u2019t tell you what happened to you, they just destroy you. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening in the United States House of Representatives right now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn every sense, this is a mob taking over the rule of law. This is fundamentally un-American and until it changes, I will fight back as hard as I can,\u201d he said of House Democrats.\n\nGraham\u2019s comments reflect the escalating rhetoric and rising tensions surrounding the impeachment process, which were punctuated Tuesday by Trump's Tuesday morning tweet.\n\n\u201cSo some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cAll Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!\u201d\n\nThe tweet drew an immediate backlash from black lawmakers, such as House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn James (Jim) Enos ClyburnPelosi calls Cummings 'our North Star' as Democratic leaders mourn his death Democrats gauge support for vote on impeachment inquiry Nancy Pelosi is ready for this fight MORE (D-S.C.), who said, \u201cI really believe this man is prone to inflammatory statements, and that is one word no president ought to apply to himself.\u201d\n\nGraham, however, said House Democrats are more guilty of bad behavior by conducting an impeachment inquiry without a formal vote that would give House Republicans more power to defend the president and Trump\u2019s legal team the ability to call witnesses.\n\n\u201cIf this continues in the House, it\u2019s a complete sham and I will do everything I can to make sure it doesn\u2019t live very long in the Senate,\u201d Graham said.\n\n\u201cIf the shoe were on the other foot, if a Democratic president was going through a process like this created by the Republican majority in the House, the American media would be blowing up right now,\u201d he added.", "description": "Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on Tuesday said President Trump is absolutely right to call the House impeachment process a \u201clynching.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/grahamlindsey_072319as_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
