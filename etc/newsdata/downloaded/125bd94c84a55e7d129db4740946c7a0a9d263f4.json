It owns the biggest US health insurer, with about 50 million members. It also has a huge hand in the prescription-drug business through its OptumRx unit.\n\nAnd, increasingly, UnitedHealth is playing a bigger role in the business of getting medical care too. Already, the company's OptumCare business employs or works with 45,000 doctors, from surgeons to primary-care providers. UnitedHealth wants OptumCare to reach $100 billion a year in revenue by 2028, up from roughly $16 billion last year.\n\nIt's part of a push by healthcare companies to gain more control over how healthcare gets paid for and provided to patients. In 2018, CVS Health closed its $70 billion deal with the health insurer Aetna, which combined a retail pharmacy and an insurer with the hope of being more involved in Americans' healthcare.\n\nRead more: Meet the 8 companies changing how doctors get paid and building the future of medicine\n\nUnitedHealth's goal to hit $100 billion in revenue by 2028 at OptumCare is ambitious. HCA Healthcare, the largest for-profit health system in the US, operates 185 hospitals and 119 freestanding surgery centers around the US and the UK. In 2018, it had operating revenue of $46.7 billion.\n\nDuring UnitedHealth's third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, Optum CEO Andrew Witty spelled out some examples of what the business unit looks like as UnitedHealth strives to expand it.\n\nHow OptumCare fits into UnitedHealth Group\n\nThe decision to build up the healthcare-delivery business at UnitedHealth was set in motion about a decade ago, starting with primary care. UnitedHealth later expanded into surgical services that could be done outside hospitals.\n\nToday, the business operates urgent-care centers like MedExpress, surgery centers through Surgical Care Affiliates, and primary-care practices. UnitedHealth in June closed a $4 billion deal with DaVita Medical Group, which added significantly to its footprint.\n\nOptumCare is separate from UnitedHealth's insurance operation and provides medical care to people with many different types of health insurance. It is in network with 80 insurers, UnitedHealth has said.\n\nWitty called OptumCare the largest part of OptumHealth, a unit within Optum. Other businesses at OptumHealth include Optum Bank, which stores funds that people use to pay for their medical care.\n\n4 examples of Optum's $100 billion ambitions\n\nIn southern Nevada \u2014 Optum's most developed region \u2014 OptumCare's presence is through Southwest Medical, which operates primary care, urgent care, pediatric clinics, women's health centers, a cancer center, and senior care. Witty said on Tuesday that there, Optum serves 300,000 people, 85% of whom are getting their care paid for through value-based arrangements. Witty said that was leading to a more than 10% lower cost to take care of patients compared with competitors.\n\n\u2014 Optum's most developed region \u2014 OptumCare's presence is through Southwest Medical, which operates primary care, urgent care, pediatric clinics, women's health centers, a cancer center, and senior care.

In Southern California, Optum is building its reach through an \"accountable care platform\" with 1.5 million people on it. It's working with 30 insurers on a network that pulls together 100 clinics and about 30 surgery centers. In combination with UnitedHealth's health-insurance arm, Optum created a product named Harmony. Witty described the product as providing \"a seamless experience by uniting care and coverage, achieving 20% savings for people as compared to UnitedHealthcare's comparable coverage offerings.\"\n\nOptum is building its reach through an \"accountable care platform\" with 1.5 million people on it.
