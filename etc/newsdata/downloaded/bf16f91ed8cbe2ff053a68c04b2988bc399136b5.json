Shaky videos captured shoppers rushing to get outside while others sheltered in stores, urged by officials to wait for help while SWAT teams searched the area.\n\nThe chaotic scene quickly drew comparisons to the Aug. 3 shooting at a shopping area in El Paso that left 22 dead. That massacre and so many others have put shoppers on high alert as loud noises and armed confrontations cause panic and as fears rise that crowded public places present \u201csoft targets\u201d for acts of violence.\n\nAD\n\nIn Boca Raton, police tweeted at 3:30 p.m. Sunday that authorities were on the scene. By 4:15 p.m., they said there was \u201cno active shooter at this time,\u201d although authorities continued to search the mall.\n\nAD\n\nI am currently stuck in a Victoria Secret due to a reported shooter in the Boca Raton Town Center Mall, I am safe w my friends.

Others recalled what sounded \u201clike pops, not automatic gunfire,\u201d per a journalist\u2019s tweet. Employees caught in the mall\u2019s lockdown texted their loved ones, a local reporter said, while crowds filled the parking lot outside the upscale complex billed online as \u201cone of south Florida\u2019s top luxury shopping destinations.\u201d\n\nMany said they simply saw people running and joined them.\n\nOne student at Boca Raton High School, who declined to give her name, told the Palm Beach Post that she reacted based on her school\u2019s regular instructions for responding to a \u201ccode red.\"\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have this training. \u2026 I just ran,\u201d she said as her family remained stuck indoors.\n\nRalph Saintilien, a sales associate at the mall\u2019s Forever 21 store, told the newspaper that he stayed calm as he left the building, wary of increasing the risk of someone getting hurt. Police said some people suffered minor injuries while fleeing.\n\nAD\n\nThe man with the head injury was taken to Delray Medical Center, police said.\n\nOfficials said in the evening that most people had been able to leave the mall \u2014 and urged patience as some remained trapped.\n\n\u201cWe have been stuck inside a store since 3:15 today,\u201d one Twitter user wrote at about 6 p.m. \u201cWhat is the time frame to let us out!?!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOne girl lost her shoe in the scuffle to get out. I see one guy on the ground getting medical attention but it appears he was trampled.

In August, days after mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, a backfiring motorcycle triggered a stampede in Times Square. So did the sounds of a falling sign in Utah.\n\nOther evacuations involve weapons brandished but not fired: In August, a Walmart in Missouri evacuated after a man showed up armed with a military-style rifle in what he called a \u201csocial experiment\u201d meant to test his Second Amendment rights. He was charged with making a terrorist threat. That same month, fearful customers ran out of another Walmart in Louisiana after men drew weapons during an argument, police said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhatever the cause or ultimate damage, the terror of an active-shooter alert can traumatize people and take a toll on police resources, experts say. Police told The Washington Post earlier this year that they respond to each alarm ready for the next massacre.\n\n\u201cIf people are reporting a critical incident or being descriptive in terms of someone shooting, [saying] there\u2019s an active shooter \u2014 especially since we\u2019ve had something significant occur here in the past \u2014 we\u2019re responding as if it\u2019s real and preparing to deal with that particular threat,\u201d said David L. Maggard Jr., chief of police at the Los Angeles and Van Nuys airports.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Shoppers are on high alert as fears rise that crowded public places present so-called \u201csoft targets\u201d for mass violence.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Sg7OY4O_TiVKWdaWq1jZCFVPxlM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D55CD4HOBQI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
