The Democrats\u2019 bill goes further, negotiating a wider array of drugs and extending the discounted prices to other purchasers, including employer health plans.\n\nCompanies that refuse to negotiate would be slapped with penalties equal to 65% of gross sales of the drug in question.\n\nThe plan forces companies to pay rebates to Medicare if they raise prices faster than the rate of inflation, and it caps co-pays for seniors on the Medicare drug benefit at $2,000.\n\nMrs. Pelosi, who played a key role in writing the bill with committee chairmen, said the American people want results.\n\n\u201cThe issue of the cost of prescription drugs is one subject that can make grown men cry,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a political issue at the polls, we want a solution in the Congress, and we want it now.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump applauded the effort, though House Republicans panned the bill as a form of government overreach that boxes out their ideas, effectively leaving it to Mrs. Pelosi to lobby Mr. Trump and heap pressure on the GOP-led Senate, which is pursuing its own bills.\n\n\u201cWe do hope to have White House buy-in,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi said, noting it\u2019s the best way to force a Senate vote.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, however, said it has \u201cabsolutely no chance \u2014 zero, zip, nada \u2014 no chance of passing the Senate or becoming law.\u201d\n\nThe Senate is working on a bill that, like the Pelosi plan, would install inflation caps on pharmaceutical prices and cap seniors\u2019 out-of-pocket costs. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley is leading the effort.\n\nMr. Trump late Thursday said he just wants to see progress.\n\n\u201cI like Sen. Grassley\u2019s drug pricing bill very much, and it\u2019s great to see Speaker Pelosi\u2019s bill today. Let\u2019s get it done in a bipartisan way!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nMrs. Pelosi issued at least one red line, however \u2014 she will not drop the part of her bill that allows for government negotiation.\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 absolutely, positively not,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi said.\n\nHer plan calls for HHS to negotiate the price of no fewer than 25 drugs each year \u2014 250 is the ceiling \u2014 though some liberals say the minimum should be higher.\n\nMr. Trump signaled support for using government authority to negotiate prices during the 2016 campaign, but backed off as president.\n\nHe has, however, pushed to set the cost of some Medicare-covered drugs at levels closer to other countries, saying foreigners are freeloading on Americans.\n\nLowering the cost of prescription drugs is a top priority for voters, edging out protections for preexisting conditions and lowering the cost of medical services in a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll on health care priorities for Congress.\n\n\u201cIf Trump wants a policy win before the election, this issue is one where he can get something done,\u201d said Darrell West, director of governance studies for the Brookings Institution.\n\nHealth care, generally, was a winner for Democrats during the 2018 midterm elections, so House leadership is steering the conversation in that direction even as liberal members of the restive caucus cry for impeachment.\n\nMrs. Pelosi has urged a methodical approach, hoping to keep the focus on the Democrats\u2019 policy agenda and insulate centrist members who swiped seats in 2018 and could be punished for a hasty impeachment drive.\n\n\u201cWe are legislating, investigating and litigating, and I trust the work of the committees,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi said.\n\nMr. West said it\u2019s an obvious calculus for leadership.\n\nDrug pricing is \u201ca bread-and-butter issue to which everyone can relate,\u201d he said. \u201cThat subject helped Democrats win back the House in 2018 and it has great potential for helping the party in 2020. There is much greater support for pricing rules among the general public than presidential impeachment.\u201d\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee scheduled a hearing on the Pelosi bill for next week, putting it on pace for passage before the end of the year.\n\nEvery Republican on the committee rejected the bill Thursday, saying it bypassed their input and other plans in the pipeline.\n\n\u201cIt does not have to be this way. There are bipartisan solutions to bring down prices for patients and create real transparency and accountability for this system,\u201d the Republicans, led by Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, said.\n\nThe pharmaceutical lobby blasted the plan, saying it would upend Medicare\u2019s drug benefit for seniors and undo America\u2019s market-based system.\n\n\u201cIt would fundamentally restructure how patients access medicines by giving the federal government unprecedented, sweeping authority to set medicine prices in public and private markets while importing price controls from other countries that restrict access to innovative medicines,\u201d said Stephen J. Ubl, president and CEO of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
