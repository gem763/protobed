There needs to be accountability. I mean, what are you going to do in the next one year to diminish the mentally retarded action of this guy?\" The audience laughed and applauded after the person's question.\n\n\"Well said, well said,\" Harris said, laughing.\n\nBrown said in a follow-up tweet that Harris' apparent agreement was a \"betrayal of the disability community.\"\n\n\"Using 'retarded' as a slur and an insult is never, EVER 'well said,' @KamalaHarris, no matter who it's against and no matter the larger point being made. It's ALWAYS a betrayal of the disability community. We need-and expect-better from you. #CripTheVote,\" Harris wrote.\n\nHarris told CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns in an exclusive interview that she did not register the offensive term used in the moment, saying she did not \"hear or process or in any way condone\" it.\n\nYesterday, someone at a @KamalaHarris event called Pres. Trump \u201cmentally retarded.\u201d The 2020 candidate told @CHueyBurns the term is \u201cincredibly offensive\u201d and said in 2019 you would think \"people would have a much better understanding of how hurtful a term like that can be.\" pic.twitter.com/01amMnkaqi \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) September 7, 2019\n\n\"It's an incredibly offensive term,\" Harris said in an interview. \"It's offensive and you would think that in the year 2019, people would have a much better understanding of how hurtful a term like that can be.\"\n\n\"I heard him talk about the other stuff and then that came later and it was not something that I really heard or processed ... or in any way condone, that's for sure,\" Harris continued.\n\nIn a follow-up after CBS News' interview, Harris worte that \"when my staff played the video from my town hall yesterday, it was upsetting. I didn't hear the words the man used in that moment, but if I had I would've stopped and corrected him. I'm sorry. That word and others like it aren't acceptable. Ever.\"\n\nWhen my staff played the video from my town hall yesterday, it was upsetting.
