Three top executives have since resigned.\n\nThe JSE-listed company then tasked law firm ENS to investigate R1.2bn in suspect transactions, primarily in EOH\u2019s dealings with the public sector.\n\nOn Tuesday, EOH said in an update to shareholders that the amount has since been reduced to R935 million and includes:\n\ntransactions with no evidence of contracting or work done, valued at R665 million;\n\nloans written off, valued at R90 million; and\n\noverbilling valued at approximately R180 million.\n\nEOH has blacklisted and suspended payments to 50 implicated enterprise development partners.\n\nSome of these companies have initiated legal challenges against EOH, which the company will \u201crobustly oppose\u201d.\n\n'Small group'\n\nA small group of individuals in the public sector team were responsible for the fraud, EOH said. The investigation has also identified various opportunistic incidents of theft from EOH, and a number of individuals have been dismissed. EOH has filed criminal charges against former staff members, and wants to recover losses from those implicated.\n\nIt has also provided information to the Hawks and the Financial Intelligence Centre.\n\nIn response to the fraud, the company says it has introduced stricter rules, including for commission payments, gifts and other incentives. The use of sales agents or middlemen are now prohibited when bidding for contracts.\n\n\"The company is focused on removing any culture of hierarchy and fear which dissuades employees from speaking up and voicing important issues related to the business.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, EOH reported that for the year to end-July, its revenue fell almost 3% to R11.791bn, while its headline loss tripled from 546c a share to 1 681c.\n\n\"The ongoing weakness in the macroeconomic environment, the ENSafrica investigation and the reputational impact of Microsoft cancelling its licence reseller agreement as well as the delay in infrastructure projects in the NEXTEC business has led to depressed revenues and margin pressure for the 2019 financial year,\" EOH said.\n\nGross debt, meanwhile, fell by approximately R500 million to R3.167bn, as the company started selling some of its assets.\n\nCompiled by Helena Wasserman", "description": "Large write-offs, in part due to the fraud, have contributed to EOH's net asset value falling almost 70% to R1.957bn in the past year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6880/48ec4b6445804daeb26d85ca8a01718a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
