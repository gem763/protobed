He began reporting on Germany in 1997.\n\nBERLIN \u2014 Just off a wide boulevard in a leafy west Berlin suburb, the U.S.-German friendship is alive and well.\n\nAmericans play football, sail and dance with their German friends. The decades-old bond between the two countries is on full display.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrouble is, it's only a display. Opened in 1998, the Allied Museum, a free exhibition housed in an old U.S. Army theater, offers a window into what once was \u2014 and a welcome escape from what is.\n\nNearly 75 years after the end of World War II, the U.S.-German relationship isn\u2019t just moribund, it\u2019s on life support.\n\nAt both the official and unofficial level, the foundation that has supported the transatlantic alliance since the 1950s is crumbling. About 85 percent of Germans consider their country\u2019s relationship with the U.S. to be \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cvery bad,\u201d according to a recent study, while a clear majority want Germany to distance itself from the U.S.\n\nAngela Merkel is in the United States this week for the United Nations climate conference but a meeting with the U.S. president, who is also in New York, is not on her agenda. Merkel didn\u2019t see Trump during her last visit to the U.S. in May either.\n\nWhile Merkel visits the U.N., her heir apparent, Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, is in Washington, where she is expected to face more tough questions at the Pentagon over German defense spending.\n\nJoin our reporters for live coverage of the U.N. General Assembly 9AM on SEPT. 24 for live coverage of the U.N. General Assembly LIVE\n\nThe fraying of ties \u2014 which began long before Trump came to power but has accelerated since \u2014 carries implications that stretch far beyond the two countries\u2019 bilateral relationship. With China seeking to expand its influence in Europe, and Russia eager to exploit the transatlantic rift, the disintegration of German-American unity would have profound implications for the future of NATO and the broader global order.\n\nThat might be why both sides are trying to pretend everything is OK.\n\n\u201cI have German in my blood,\u201d Trump, who has treated Germany like a pi\u00f1ata since he took office in 2017, said during a brief encounter with Merkel at the G-7 meeting in France last month. He added he would be \u201cvery honored\u201d to visit her in Berlin, while acknowledging he has no firm plans to do so.\n\nTrump\u2019s sudden affinity for the land of his forebears triggered an audible guffaw from Merkel, who did her best during their joint press conference to keep a straight face.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem for us to address difficult topics with one another,\u201d she insisted.\n\nMore worried than wunderbar\n\n\n\nBerlin is so worried about the deterioration in the ties with its biggest trading partner that Germany's Foreign Office is funding a special initiative dubbed \"Wunderbar Together,\" a yearlong series of events across the U.S. meant to remind Americans how much the two countries really like one another.\n\nMerkel's role in America's culture wars, where \u2014 depending on the stage \u2014 she plays either the villain who opened the floodgates to uncontrolled Muslim migration, or the saint who rescued people in need, has complicated Germany's PR effort. That was apparent during the German leader's May visit, when she was celebrated like a lost savior during her commencement speech to Harvard graduates.\n\nMerkel appeared to revel in the adulation. Whether it helps Germany, which depends on the U.S. both in economic and strategic terms, to have its leader at the center of America's partisan battlefield is another question.\n\nGermans' attitude to Trump is much more straightforward: They universally dislike him.\n\nWhen it comes to relations between nations, most Americans continue to have a positive view of Germany \u2014 in contrast to Germans' opinion of the U.S.\n\nBut the \u201cdifficult topics\u201d that Merkel referenced dominate the official conversation. Whether the question is Iran, trade, defense spending or climate change, Berlin and Washington are at loggerheads. Even in areas where strategic logic should make them natural allies \u2014 such as confronting China\u2019s growing influence \u2014 the two have failed to move beyond their differences.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to blame the troubled relations on Trump\u2019s withering attacks on Germany. His riffs on Germany\u2019s tepid defense spending, its chronic trade surpluses and \u201cAhngula\u2019s\u201d migration policies are among the highlights of his rhetorical repertoire.\n\n\u201cIn contrast to every other president before him, Trump has created the impression that partnership amongst equals isn\u2019t desired,\u201d former German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who now heads the transatlantic lobbying group Atlantik Br\u00fccke, told me recently.\n\nIn truth, the U.S.-German alliance has never been a partnership of equals. Tension has been part of the mix throughout the post-war era to varying degrees. If Konrad Adenauer and John F. Kennedy shared a mutual dislike, Helmut Schmidt and Jimmy Carter absolutely despised one another.\n\nFrom the 1960s until the end of the Cold War, Germans took to the streets in droves to voice their opposition to both the U.S. war in Vietnam and the arms race with the Soviets.\n\nEven so, this time, things really are different. And that's not just down to Trump.\n\nPeople power\n\n\n\nFor decades the German-U.S. relationship was sustained not just by military alliances and business interests, but by personal bonds. Even Germans critical of the U.S. agreed that American engagement was better than the alternative. At times of tension and disagreement, most Germans gave America the benefit of the doubt.\n\nOver the course of the Cold War, millions of American soldiers were stationed in Germany, where many married and had children. Untold thousands of German teenagers went to the U.S. as exchange students and countless more studied at U.S. universities.\n\nWith the fall of the Berlin Wall, the number of U.S. military personnel fell dramatically from nearly 250,000 in 1985 to about 35,000 today. Though the U.S. remains a favorite destination for German high schoolers, the number of exchange students heading across the Atlantic has dropped by about 30 percent since 2009 to fewer than 6,000.\n\nAs the U.S. troops have gradually withdrawn, the residual gratitude many Germans felt over their presence has also evaporated.\n\nDuring my first posting in Germany as a correspondent in the mid-1990s, the Germans I met brimmed with enthusiasm for all things American and were full of stories of their adventures there. Even if they took issue with many U.S. policies, there was a reserve of goodwill, a sense that we were all on the same side.\n\nWhen the subject comes up these days, it\u2019s like walking on eggshells.\n\n\u201cMy father was a big fan of the U.S. and its democracy,\u201d a new acquaintance told me recently, making it clear that he didn\u2019t share his father\u2019s perspective.\n\nThe German distrust began to take hold in the aftermath of 9/11. Though Germany joined the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan against the Taliban, Berlin refused to participate in the Iraq War, arguing there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to support claims that Saddam Hussein had stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nWhile Germany\u2019s decision under then-Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der proved to be prescient, it also left a wound that has never fully healed. In recent years, Germany\u2019s view of the U.S. has been framed by Guantanamo, NSA spying and Trump\u2019s attacks.\n\nThose issues made it easier for Germans to ignore persistent U.S. demands that Berlin reduce its massive export surplus, which most economists agree exacerbate global imbalances, or that it meet the NATO defense spending target. The last two U.S. administrations also pressured Merkel's government to spend more on security, albeit with little success. Trump, on the other hand, appears to have gotten the Germans' attention.\n\nBut Trump's relentless pressure campaign has come at a cost at street level.\n\nFor almost 60 years, Germans and Americans have celebrated their friendship with an annual Volksfest, an open-air fair with a replica town from the Old West, hotdogs and American music. In July, the fest was canceled for the second time in three years after Berlin Mayor Michael M\u00fcller, who heads a leftist coalition, claimed to have failed to find a venue.\n\nJust weeks earlier, M\u00fcller\u2019s city government refused to allow 20 \u201cCandy Bombers\u201d \u2014 the historic U.S. transport aircraft used during the Berlin Airlift \u2014 to land at the city\u2019s Tempelhof airport, citing local laws and safety regulations. Some of the planes had been flown over from the U.S. for the event.\n\nWhat\u2019s striking about such incidents is that few Germans seem to really care. A couple of newspaper writers expressed outrage over the Candy Bomber snub, but the story was quickly forgotten.\n\nEven though the U.S. remains the guarantor of German security, for many Germans, both in and out of government, America is just another partner, not a true friend. Travel-obsessed Germans still visit the U.S. by the millions on vacation, to enjoy the beaches in Florida or the sights of New York. Just like they go to Turkey, another erstwhile German friend with whom relations have soured.\n\nRecent suggestions by U.S. officials that Washington might transfer its German-based forces to Poland were met with a collective shrug in Berlin. Even though most German officials viewed it as an empty threat, some joked that losing the bases might be worth it if it took Germany out of Trump\u2019s crosshairs.\n\nWith official German-U.S. relations at such a low point, it\u2019s been left to a small band of die-hard believers to keep the transatlantic flame burning.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, Trump is the dominant factor in the transatlantic relationship,\u201d said Wolfgang Ischinger, the former German ambassador to Washington who now heads the Munich Security Conference, an annual forum that has been a fixture of the transatlantic dialogue for decades.\n\nIschinger does not believe the the U.S.-German alliance can return to the \u201cstatus quo ante\u201d after Trump\u2019s presidency, but he said he hasn't given up hope on a relationship that delivered his country from tyranny and returned it to prosperity.\n\n\u201cGeorge W. Bush wasn\u2019t that popular in Western Europe either,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut as soon as Barack Obama emerged as a candidate, 200,000 people ran to Berlin\u2019s Victory Column to listen to him speak and to cheer. Suddenly, America was highly popular again and our entire nation was excited.\u201d\n\nIf all else fails, that could be the final exhibit in the Allied Museum.\n\n", "description": "Once firm friends and allies, the two old partners are drifting apart \u2014 and that\u2019s not just down to Trump.", "authors": ["Matthew Karnitschnig"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/96/41/75dfd2b94ccebde9e0047a3ef602/190923-trump-merkel-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
