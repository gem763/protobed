To tame her inbox and handle what she admits is a stressful subject for her, Chen told the podcast \"The Cut on Tuesdays\" about the time-saving email hack she developed during her time at Teen Vogue.\n\nFirst, she took a look at the most common types of emails she'd get in a day, then broke them down into eight to 10 different categories based on what kind of response they required. For example, an event invite could elicit an \"RSVP Yes\" or \"RSVP No,\" while other questions could be best handled if directed to her assistant.\n\nShe then created email signatures with those canned responses, which she selects from as she moves through her inbox to speed up the process, and adds personalized messages as necessary.\n\nThe automated method has helped as Chen has moved up in her career from beauty and health director at Teen Vogue to editor-in-chief at Lucky magazine to her leadership role at Instagram \u2014 as with great power comes great responsibility (to answer your coworkers' emails).\n\nThese days, though, it also helps that Chen takes a more lax approach to maintaining zero unread messages.\n\n\"I used to be really crazy fanatical about Inbox Zero,\" she told The Cut's editor-in-chief Stella Bugbee on the podcast. \"Now, I have made peace for my work email with Inbox 350. I am currently at Inbox 600, but I'm going to get back down to Inbox 350, and maybe one day I'll be at Inbox 100.\"", "description": "Eva Chen, Instagram's director of fashion partnerships, created the method when she was an editor at Teen Vogue and has been using it ever since.", "authors": ["Jennifer Liu"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106199531-1571865832802gettyimages-1055050188.jpg?v=1571865949", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
