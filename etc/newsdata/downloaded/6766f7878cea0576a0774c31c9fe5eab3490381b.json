For example, tha ability to watch any video if you're in a meeting or on the subway without disturbing the people around you.\"\n\nEnglish will be the only language supported by Live Caption and it will not work with phone calls, voice calls or video calls.\n\nGoogle revealed in September that the Pixel 4 range of phones will be launched at an event in New York City on 15 October. Pre-orders will likely open on that day before the global release date before the end of the month.\n\nNumerous other leaks mean there will be little left for Google to reveal at launch.\n\nIt is expected to come with a significantly improved camera, as well as gesture controls that allow users to navigate by waving their hands at their phones.", "description": "The new Pixel 4 phone will come with an innovative feature first teased by Google earlier this year during a demonstration of its Android 10 operating system.
