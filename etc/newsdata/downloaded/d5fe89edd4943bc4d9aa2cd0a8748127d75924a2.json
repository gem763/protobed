(City of Ottawa)\n\n'Huge win'\n\nDenhez said he'd quibble with some aspects of the decision, but overall he feels the group's arguments were heard.\n\n\"On the major issue that was before us, it came down squarely in favour of the position we were advocating.\"\n\nDenhez said all of council's previous approvals hinged on this step.\n\n\"The small print at the bottom of the page said this is all still conditional on getting all of your ducks lined up in a row at the committee of adjustment. It is right there in black and white on the printed page.\"\n\nCoun. Mathieu Fleury, who tried to get councillors to reverse their prior approval earlier this year, caled the decision a \"huge win\" that will stop the project from going ahead.\n\nHe said he hopes it sends a message to the developer.\n\n\"It signals to the applicant to come back to the table, work with the community, work with Heritage Ottawa, work with the friends of Ch\u00e2teau Laurier,\" he said.\n\n\"We are not opposed to an addition of seven storeys. We are opposed to the materials, the shape. We really feel they are not compatible.\"\n\nPlanner Dennis Jacobs, who represents Larco, had no comment on the committee's decision Friday afternoon, but during the original hearing said that denying the variance would force the developer back to council.\n\nLarco has until Oct. 17 to launch an appeal to Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.", "description": "The planned expansion of the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier was dealt a blow Friday\u00a0as the city's committee of adjustment\u00a0said no to\u00a0part of the controversial addition's\u00a0design.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5209032.1568630277!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/chateau-laurier-addition-version-5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
