Yet Warren also found herself the target of barbs from other candidates, mainly from moderates, over her leftwing positions on healthcare, taxes and big tech.\n\nThe debate opened with a display of unity over the House of Representatives\u2019 rapidly unfolding impeachment inquiry into Trump, with the Democrats unloading on the \u201ccriminal in the White House\u201d and the \u201cthe most corrupt and unpatriotic president we\u2019ve ever had\u201d.\n\nBiden, who has been dragged into the impeachment maelstrom by Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claims that Biden and his son were involved in wrongdoing in Ukraine, defended his conduct as vice-president.\n\n\u201cMy son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said, arguing that Trump\u2019s baseless attacks reveal Trump\u2019s fear of running against him in a general election.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going after me because he knows if I get the nomination I will beat him like a drum,\u201d Biden said.\n\nThere was another rare moment of unity later on after Sanders, 78, the oldest candidate in the field, thanked his supporters and his rivals for their well wishes as he recovered from suffering a heart attack two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d Sanders said before inviting the audience to attend his Bernie\u2019s Back rally in New York this weekend.\n\nBut the ideological divide over healthcare \u2013 and the attacks on Warren \u2013 flared early in the debate. Several trailing candidates rounded on the Massachusetts senator, who has embraced Bernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All healthcare plan but, unlike Sanders, has resisted efforts to pin her down how she will pay for the multitrillion-dollar plan.\n\nSanders has acknowledged that implementing Medicare for All would require raising taxes on middle-class families. Asked explicitly whether she would raise taxes to pay for the plan, Warren again avoided the question, insisting instead that the overall cost Americans pay for healthcare would go down.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bernie Sanders in Westerville, Ohio, on 15 October. Photograph: John Minchillo/AP\n\nPete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who escalated his attacks on Warren\u2019s healthcare plan ahead of the debate, seized on her pivot: \u201cWe heard it tonight: a yes or no question that did not get a yes or no answer. Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything, except for this.\u201d\n\nWarren fired back that Buttigieg\u2019s healthcare plan \u2013 \u201cMedicare for All who want it\u201d \u2013 was actually \u201cMedicare for all who can afford it\u201d and would leave millions of Americans uninsured.\n\n\u201cAt least Bernie is being honest here,\u201d interjected the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, a moderate who has has not gained traction. \u201cThe difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done.\u201d\n\nIn a section about Warren\u2019s idea for a wealth tax, Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke said it can appear that Warren is \u201cmore focused on being punitive and pitting some part of the country against the other instead of lifting people up\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I\u2019m punitive,\u201d Warren replied, and then reprised a version of the speech that helped catapult her onto the national stage when she ran for senator in 2012.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou made a fortune in America, you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it, good for you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you built that fortune in America. And I guarantee you built it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate.\u201d\n\nIn another fiery exchange, the two veterans on the stage, Buttigieg and the Hawaii representative Tulsi Gabbard, clashed over Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, which paved the way for a Turkish military assault on Syrian Kurds.\n\nGabbard, who has been sharply criticized over a meeting with the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, accused Trump of having the \u201cblood of the Kurds on his hands\u201d but she continued \u201cso do many of the politicians in both parties who supported this regime change war\u201d.\n\nButtigieg shot back that she was \u201cdead wrong\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy, as you\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tulsi Gabbard. Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nThe New Jersey senator Cory Booker warned that the Democrats risked playing into Trump\u2019s hands: \u201cTearing each other down because we have different plans is unacceptable. I have seen this script before.\u201d\n\nTonight\u2019s battle for the Democratic presidential nomination converged on Ohio, with a dozen candidates meeting on stage at Otterbein University in Westerville, an affluent suburb north-east of the state capital, Columbus \u2013 making for a crowded debate.\n\nTrump won Ohio by 8.5 percentage points in 2016, the widest margin of any \u201cswing\u201d state. The margin of victory in traditional battleground states is typically much closer, as it was in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three midwestern states that delivered Trump the White House.\n\nThe 10 candidates who took part in last month\u2019s third debate in Texas all qualified for Tuesday\u2019s event, along with Gabbard and Tom Steyer, a billionaire activist who is making his first debate appearance.\n\nAlso participating were the US senators Kamala Harris, former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.\n\nYounger Democratic candidates, including Buttigieg, 37, and Yang, 44, have argued it is time for new leadership in a Democratic party driven by the diverse grassroots energy of younger activists.\n\nSanders\u2019 health problems highlighted his age and that of the other top White House contenders \u2013 Biden is 76 and Warren is 70, while Trump is 73 \u2013 in a race featuring a debate about a generational change in leadership.\n\nAddressing the question of age, Warren vowed to \u201coutwork and out-organize and outlast\u201d Trump or \u201cwhoever the Republicans get stuck with\u201d as a candidate for the November 2020 election. Biden said he is running in part because of his long record and experience. With age comes wisdom, he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Democratic presidential candidates pose together on the debate stage Photograph: Aaron Josefczyk/Reuters\n\nThe packed stage and tangle of competing story lines created a contentious atmosphere, and the Democratic-led congressional impeachment inquiry into the president was a frequent theme.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry focuses on Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his unsubstantiated allegation that Biden improperly tried to aid his son Hunter\u2019s business interests in Ukraine. Trump has repeatedly tried to turn the focus on Biden with vociferous attacks on his integrity. There is no evidence that Biden or his son were involved in illegal activity.\n\nHunter Biden broke his silence on Tuesday in his first interview since the formal impeachment inquiry into Trump was announced in late September. In the ABC interview, which aired hours before the debate, he admitted to \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in taking a paid position in a Ukrainian gas company \u2013 but denied doing anything wrong.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden has seen his once solid lead in opinion polls in the Democratic race diminished by Warren who has steadily risen over the past two months.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee again will increase the fundraising and polling criteria to qualify for next month\u2019s debate in Georgia. So far, only eight of the 12 candidates participating in Ohio would qualify, according to a CNN analysis. Nineteen contenders remain in the Democratic race overall.", "description": "Twelve Democrats targeted Warren over healthcare, taxes and big tech in first debate since Trump impeachment inquiry", "authors": ["Lauren Gambino"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da0fae452159c3de9a13a97b51c55a705db77d2a/0_341_5111_3067/master/5111.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a17c2e22e3428680959494ef289c1f1a", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
