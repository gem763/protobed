It's ironic, considering we're living in an age of empowered females, Couric tells USA TODAY.\n\nWomen are engaging in sexual activity that can be hurtful because that's what boys and girls see and play out when they're older, Couric says.\n\nDuring the podcast, Couric interviews a cultural pornography expert, a sex education teacher and teens. At the end, the award-winning broadcaster says, \"Porn-informed sex ed is absolutely imperative.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m learning along with the listener,\" Couric tells USA TODAY. \"I think people can\u2019t pretend it\u2019s not being viewed by teenagers all across the country. So I think we just have to keep that in mind when you\u2019re helping kids understand what sex is and what healthy relationships are.\"\n\nGirls 'socialized to please'\n\nCouric began exploring porn's impact on intimacy after reading about a study by the Indiana University School of Public Health in which women said they were fearful of sex. She talked about it with a gynecologist and her friends.\n\nShe decided to address the issue in the episode titled \"Is Violent Porn Changing Us?\" that aired Sept. 26.\n\nIn it, she interviews Gail Dines, author of \"Pornland: How Porn has Hijacked Our Sexuality.\" Dines says one young woman Couric interviewed believed she was giving consent to being routinely choked by her boyfriend only because she was \"socialized to please men.\"\n\nKatie Couric's guests on her new podcast episode, \"Is Violent Porn Changing Us?\" answer an emphatic yes.

That\u2019s not what intimacy is about. That's performance. That\u2019s fantasy.\"\n\nThe podcast concludes with advice on how parents can address porn culture with their children: It is thousands of small conversations and not one big talk at the dinner table.\n\nCouric, 62, tells USA TODAY she was surprised to learn that Pornhub attracts more monthly visitors than Amazon, Netflix and Twitter combined. \"I feel for parents now,\" she says. Couric has two daughters, Ellie Monahan, 28, and Carrie Monahan, 23.\n\nShe says hardcore porn is absent of women's desire to engage in sex. \"I think because of that, it's really complicating the issue of consent,\" she says.\n\nKatie Couric has more questions\n\n\"Next Question With Katie Couric\" officially launched Thursday with an episode on cannabidiol, or CBD oil. In it, she talks with guest Kristen Bell about the science and research behind CBD oil and how consumers can make smart choices about purchasing it. Bell is a fan of CBD oil.\n\nThe podcast episodes will air every Thursday. There are 12 episodes. Upcoming episodes include celebrity guests such as Julie Andrews, Jennifer Garner and Andy Grammer and will tackle a range of issues such as ageism and vaping.\n\n\"I've got a ton of questions,\" Couric says in a preview clip for the podcast. \" 'Next Question' aims to make sense of our chaotic, complicated and ever-changing world one question at at time.\"\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/10/katie-couric-launches-new-podcast-talks-kids-access-porn/3923651002/", "description": "Katie Couric's new podcast, \"Next Question,\" will include celebrity guests and tackle topics to make sense of our \"chaotic\" world.", "authors": ["Sonja Haller", "Published A.M.
