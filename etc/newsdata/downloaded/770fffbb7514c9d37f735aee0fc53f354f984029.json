We will fight for righteousness. I put on the mask to tell the government that I\u2019m not afraid of tyranny.\u201d\n\nHong Kong\u2019s four months of protests have plunged the Chinese-ruled city into its worst political crisis in decades and pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power six years ago.\n\nWhat started as opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill has swelled into a pro-democracy movement against what is seen as Beijing\u2019s increasing grip on the city, undermining its \u201cone country, two systems\u201d status promised when Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997.\n\nChina dismisses the accusation, saying foreign governments, including Britain and the United States, have fanned anti-China sentiment.\n\nProtesters on Sunday chanted \u201cHong Kongers, revolt\u201d and \u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong\u201d, as riot police monitored them from overhead walkways and footbridges, some taking photographs and filming the marchers.\n\nSome roads clogged with protesters resembled a field of flowers, with thousands of colorful umbrellas. Umbrellas are a symbol of an earlier pro-democracy movement, but were being used on Sunday simply to keep off the rain.\n\nAnti-government protesters attend a demonstration in Wan Chai district, in Hong Kong, China October 6, 2019.

One masked protester carried a mask-wearing \u201cBuzz Lightyear\u201d doll from Walt Disney Co\u2019s (DIS.N) \u201cToy Story\u201d animation film.\n\nAs the day wore on protesters started to target subway stations and China banks, just as they did on Friday, which forced the unprecedented closure of the city\u2019s metro railway.\n\nA branch of China Construction Bank (Asia) near Prince Edward station was vandalized on Sunday with \u201cNo China\u201d sprayed on it\u2019s wall. Wan Chai station, closed with a neon sign saying serious vandalism, had a protester sheet draped over it which read: \u201cthis way to HELL\u201d.\n\nProtesters tore up pavements bricks to use as ammunition against police, who in return baton charged and pepper sprayed fleeing protesters.\n\nFriday night\u2019s \u201cextreme violence\u201d justified the use of emergency laws, Beijing-backed Lam said on Saturday, but the laws have sparked further violent protests.\n\nThe current \u201cprecarious situation\u201d, which endangered public safety, left no timely solution but the anti-mask law, Matthew Cheung, Hong Kong\u2019s chief secretary, wrote on his blog on Sunday. He urged people to oppose violence ahead of grassroots district council elections set for Nov. 24.\n\nFour months of protests has pushed the Asian financial hub to the brink of its first recession in a decade.\n\nHong Kong may have lost as much as $4 billion in deposits to rival financial hub Singapore from June through August, Goldman Sachs estimated this week.\n\nSlideshow (41 Images)\n\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan in a blog on Sunday said despite recent obstacles, the banking system remained sound and the financial market was functioning well.\n\n\u201cHong Kong will not implement foreign exchange controls. The Hong Kong dollar can be exchanged freely and capital can come in and out freely. This is the solemn guarantee of the Basic Law,\u201d said Chan.", "description": "Hong Kong police and protesters clashed on Sunday as tens of thousands marched through the central city wearing face masks in defiance of colonial-era emergency powers which threaten them with a year in prison for hiding their faces.", "authors": ["Donny Kwok", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437667758&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF9507H", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
