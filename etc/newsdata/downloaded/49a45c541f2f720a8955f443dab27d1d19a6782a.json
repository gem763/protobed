So that could nudge women back towards child care \u2014 especially when day care bills are so high.\n\n\u201cWhat the $24,000 means depends is who is doing the deciding,\u201d Bailey said. If employers are pushing out new mothers, the $24,000 could be viewed as a $24,000 deprivation in wages, she said.\n\nOn the other hand, she said, \u201cif women are opting out, you can think about this as a $24,000 investment in the next generation.\u201d\n\nThe new research noted that paid leave laws and company policies are couched as ways to let women stay in the workforce and narrow the wage gap with men.\n\nOther studies point out parenthood is a major psychological and social transition for mothers, and fathers too. Likewise, the first years of a child\u2019s life are critical. In the first 12 months alone, a baby\u2019s brain doubles in size.\n\nWomen\u2019s earnings and employment rates could be declining for two reasons, the study said.\n\nOne theory is that employers could be discriminating against women who choose to take the leave, by nudging new mothers out or making their work lives so miserable upon return that mothers leave.\n\nAnother possibility is that some women are reducing their job hours or taking themselves out of the workforce to stay home with their child, the authors said.\n\n\u201cIf investment in parenting is increasing in time spent with infants\u2026additional leave may encourage women to invest more in their children (and less in their careers) \u2014 even if treatment by employers at the time they return to work is the same,\u201d the study said.\n\nBased on the clues available, the second explanation seems more likely, said University of Michigan Professor Martha Bailey, one of the study\u2019s authors.\n\nFor one thing, if systemic discrimination was happening, the research would have shown effects on mothers who had more children after their first one. Yet the research found \u201clittle effect\u201d in wages and employment for these women.\n\nOne way Bailey and the other researchers interpreted the data is that \u201cnew mothers are trying to learn how to be both parents and workers,\u201d and the end result is some are \u201copting out to spend more time with their kids.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, Bailey wasn\u2019t trying to give employers a pass. \u201cWe can\u2019t rule out discrimination at all,\u201d she told MarketWatch.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Elizabeth Warren says she was fired for being pregnant, but such discrimination remains a widespread problem\n\nAs more states follow California\u2019s lead and enact paid leave laws, the study is a reminder about the potential for unintended consequences. New Jersey and Rhode Island already have paid leave laws in effect, while laws in New York, Washington D.C. and Washington are scheduled to go live next year.\n\nMeanwhile, companies are increasingly offering paid leave to men and women to meet employee demand and stay competitive in a tight job market. The human resources consulting company Mercer said 40% of all companies offered paid leave in 2018, up from 25% in 2015.\n\nSee also: America\u2019s child-care crisis: \u2018The entire system is experiencing pressure from every angle and something\u2019s got to blow\u2019\n\n(The new study noted California women with access to paid leave weren\u2019t any more likely to stick with their employer than women without access to the policy.)\n\nFor all the gains in paid leave, only 17% of all civilian workers have access to paid leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. America is the only highly-industrialized nation without a federal paid leave law on the books. The Family and Medical Leave Act allows new parents to take up to 12 weeks off, but without pay.\n\nThe new research shouldn\u2019t cast doubt on the value of paid leave laws, Bailey told MarketWatch.\n\n\u201cIf we are worried about the unintended consequences of these policies on equity in the labor market, we need to think about how to implement the policies better,\u201d she said. Subsidized child care would be one possible solution, she said.\n\nChild Care Aware of America says the annual cost to send one California infant to a day care center is $16,542, which is 17.6% of a household\u2019s median income in the state. Child Care Aware of America is an advocacy organization pressing for affordable health care. Families should only spent 7% of their income on child care, according to a 2016 federal government recommendation.", "description": "Researchers reviewed tax data, which only shows so much.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU225_paid_l_ZG_20191029123731.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
