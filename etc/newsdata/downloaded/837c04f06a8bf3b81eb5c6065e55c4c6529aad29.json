In 1995 it bought South African cosmetics brand Justine as it rapidly expanded into the developing world.\n\nThis month the South African company launched what it characterised as an empowerment opportunity for women, with the promise that those women can learn digital skills and entrepreneurship \u2013 while selling its products.\n\nWe checked out the sign-up process to become an Avon/Justine salesperson. Here's what we found.\n\nThe signup process is painless, though it takes a little longer than advertised.\n\nAlthough Avon and Justine operate separate websites to recruit new sales consultants, both use the same chatbot to start the signup process, and you can opt in to both product lines, though that increases the mandatory startup costs.\n\nThe system claims it takes 15 minutes to answer simple questions, but it is actually under five minutes, as long as you have a photo of your ID or passport ready to begin with.\n\nHowever, after providing your home address, the chatbot promises a call from Avon Justine to finalise everything within 48 hours. It actually took a little under five days for our call to come.\n\nThe commission structure is a little complicated \u2013 but really does offer up to 30% on some products, some of the time.\n\nThe \"discounts\" \u2013 or commission on offer for salespeople, start at 10% for watches, makeup brushes, and other Justine product categories. They max out at 25% for Avon-branded perfume, skin products.\n\nSell enough in one month (at the moment R7,500 in Avon products), though, and those discounts can be bumped up to 30% in the next month. The company also runs occasional time-limited specials that offer slightly higher commission levels on some product lines, though never more than 30%.\n\nThere are hidden costs, but they are not significant.\n\nAvon Justine does not charge any ongoing monthly fees \u2013 but it is mandatory to buy two printed brochures every month at a cost of R11.80 for each brand, so R23.60 a month if you are signed up for both Justine and Avon sales.\n\nEach order a representative places also attracts a R23 administration fee, which is waived for orders above R2,500.\n\nThe company also charges a R85 \"joining fee\", which it says is added on to the first order placed.\n\nHaving at least R250 cash upfront will help, but a good credit record will buy you 21 days to pay.\n\nBoth brands offer \"pay as you go\" accounts: the rep asks customers for upfront payment, and hands that money over to Avon Justine before the goods are shipped.\n\nFor those who have a good credit record, the company offers a 21-day payment window on an individual credit limit.\n\nBut the company also has a hybrid option for those who can't convince customers to pay upfront, and don't have the necessary credit record. For a R250 deposit, Avon Justine will extend R1,000 worth of credit, then double that limit after three months of on-time payments.\n\nSigning up for both brands will cost you just shy of R1,600.\n\nThe Avon and Justine brochures say your first order needs to be a minimum of R550, so R1,100 in total for both, before those extra costs.\n\nHowever, when the company called us to complete the signup process, we learnt that it is \"compulsory for first-time representatives to take a value pack\", which would bring the total cost to R1,590.\n\nThere is only one way to check out the quality of the goods you'll get in those value packs: find an existing representative of the company and talk them out of samples.\n\nUnopened products, the company tells us, can be returned for a full refund.\n\nAvon Justine salespeople can now sell entirely online \u2013 within limits.\n\nThe Avon Justine model has always been one of face-to-face interaction, where sales reps show off products, place orders on behalf of clients, receive the delivery from the company, and hand those goods over to the end customers.\n\nNow, though, it offers online ordering \u2013 via special digital storefronts for each representative \u2013 plus direct delivery to the end user. In theory that means its sales consultants can find buyers via channels such as WhatsApp or Twitter, direct the buyers to the right website, and have no further interaction on that order.\n\nDirect delivery is currently available only in parts of Johannesburg, the company told Business Insider South Africa, \"but will roll out nationally soon\".\n\nIt costs R105 extra for express delivery in no more than two days, or R68 for standard delivery that can take up to five days.\n\nThere is one catch: sales representatives sign up to an agreement where they must promise that any sales material they create, including online, will comply with the company's policies.\n\nYou can make money - as long as you can sell.\n\nThe representative agreement for new beauty consults has a stark warning for those recruited into the salesforce: \"Do not be misled by claims that high earnings are easily achieved.\"\n\nDo you sell Avon Justine products?
