But for Matty Healy of The 1975, it\u2019s a 16-year-old from Switzerland.\n\nIf you\u2019ve not met Greta Thunberg, you\u2019ve either not turned on the tv, haven\u2019t looked at the internet, and you\u2019ve probably just been living blissfully unaware of the fact that a teenager has spent the last few months spitting hard, bitter truths about the destruction of the world through climate change.\n\nPEDESTRIAN.TV sat down with Matty on the day of the Schools Strike 4 Climate and wider global climate strike \u2013 which saw hundreds of thousands of Australians gather in city centres and local parks \u2013 to talk about climate action, how to exist sustainably as a touring band, and the experience he had with Greta for the first single of The 1975\u2019s upcoming album, Notes On A Conditional Form.\n\nOh and we also took some real nice picture of him too, so enjoy.\n\nMatty Healy first met Greta Thunberg when they teamed up to record a spoken-word piece for the band\u2019s upcoming album, which features over a recurring instrumental song on each of their albums, almost like a signature track. A sign-on that opens every collection of music they\u2019ve produced to date.\n\nSeeing Greta for the first time, Matty tells me that\u2019s the one time he\u2019s felt well and truly star-struck.\n\nShe\u2019s one of the only people I\u2019ve been truly starstruck by, because she\u2019s so like, famous in regards to iconographically famous. You know she\u2019s like, on a poster with Gandhi kinda-famous. So when I first seen her through the studio, through like frosted glass as well, you could just see the outline of her. And like Slash said, \u201cto be truly iconic, you must be recognisable in silhouette.\u201d She\u2019s recognisable in silhouette. So, it was really powerful.\n\nHe also noted that Greta\u2019s presence was so powerful that it felt like an \u201cextreme version\u201d of the hope that young people instil in him, and that meeting with her reminded him a lot of the kinds of rebellious, determined ethos he grew up in.\n\n\u201cGreta is the most punk person I\u2019ve ever met in my life,\u201d Matty confessed.\n\n\u201cWhen I met her, she was wearing an \u2018anti-fascist all-stars\u2019 t-shirt. I know like, not like an \u2018antifa\u2019 \u2013 she wasn\u2019t supporting violence, she was supporting\u2026fucking wild, man. Like I came from that kind of thing.\u201d\n\nMatty Healy told me that before he met Greta, he had a generally pretty depressed and \u201calmost nihilistic\u201d outlook on the world\u2019s relationship with climate change, and the denial that surrounds it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been kind of, not pessimistic, but just quite a depressed outlook on the situation. Kind of like a nihilistic, almost, attitude of \u2018oh well, we\u2019re all fucked\u2018,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThen after meeting her \u2013 even though she\u2019s the most serious person you could ever meet in regards to her conviction and how it feels when you talk to her \u2013 I kind of left with a bit of hope, you know?\u201d\n\nBeing a continent-hopping, touring band in 2019 is not the easiest career when you\u2019re also trying to be environmentally conscious, but Matty told me that the band has got a few pretty genius things in place to help them reduce their carbon footprint as much as possible. One of them being the introduction of an \u2018eco manager\u2019 for future tours.\n\n\u201cAt the moment that active things we\u2019re doing are planting a tree for every ticket sold, changing our guest list to being paid-for reforestation charities,\u201d he said.\n\nWe don\u2019t tour any plastic anymore, so there\u2019s no excess plastic on the tour. The record label doesn\u2019t use plastic anymore. When we\u2019re going to be touring next year, we have a climate attach\u00e9 \u2013 so we have a tour manager, a production manager, and now we have an eco manager who basically comes out with us and makes sure that everything we\u2019re doing is as sustainable as possible. It just makes sense to delegate that kind of responsibility so there\u2019s somebody\u2019s who\u2019s tenaciously focused on that.\n\nPEDESTRIAN.TV also snapped a few choice pics at The 1975\u2019s Sydney show, so take a moment to have a peep through those below.\n\n1/8Image - Paigge Warton 2/8Image - Paigge Warton 3/8Image - Paigge Warton 4/8Image - Paigge Warton Advertisement 5/8Image - Paigge Warton 6/8Image - Paigge Warton 7/8Image - Paigge Warton 8/8Image - Paigge Warton Advertisement\n\nThe 1975 return to Australia to headline Laneway Festival in early 2020 alongside the likes of Charli XCX, Earl Sweatshirt, Ruel, Ocean Alley and heaps more.", "description": "PEDESTRIAN.TV sat down with Matty Healy of The 1975 to talk about climate action and how Greta Thunberg made him \"truly starstruck\"", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/matty-healy-paigge-warton-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
