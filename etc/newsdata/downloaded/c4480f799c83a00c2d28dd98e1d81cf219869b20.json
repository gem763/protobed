Tulsi Gabbard on Friday said she supports the House\u2019s newly formal inquiry into whether to impeach President Trump, after she had repeatedly said impeachment would be too divisive for the country.\n\nShe said after reviewing the latest evidence and reports on Mr. Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, it would set a \u201cvery dangerous precedent\u201d if the House didn\u2019t proceed.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate, but necessary, that I speak in support of the inquiry into the president\u2019s alleged abuse of power in relation to his interactions with Ukraine\u2019s leaders,\u201d said the Hawaii Democrat and 2020 presidential candidate.\n\nShe called for a \u201cswift, thorough, and narrowly focused\u201d inquiry.\n\n\u201cIf we allow the president to abuse his or her power, then our society will rot from top to bottom,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will turn into a banana republic, where people in positions of power \u2014 from the president all the way down to the traffic cop \u2014 will feel it\u2019s OK to abuse their power with no consequences.\u201d\n\nMs. Gabbard had been one of the more prominent Democratic holdouts on impeachment, and her opposition stood out in a Democratic presidential field that has generally welcomed and encouraged the prospect of impeachment.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced earlier this week that the House would formally open an impeachment investigation.\n\nMany Democrats who were on the fence have cited the recently disclosed whistleblower complaint alleging that Mr. Trump pressured Mr. Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joseph R. Biden as the final tipping point.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.", "description": "Rep.
