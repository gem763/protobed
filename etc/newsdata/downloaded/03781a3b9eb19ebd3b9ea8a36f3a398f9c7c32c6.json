There was plenty of talk about \u201creproductive rights,\u201d \u201ccodifying Roe v. Wade,\u201d and \u201cwomen controlling their own bodies.\u201d There was plenty of dishonest fearmongering. There was even discussion of packing the Supreme Court with an expanded bench of pro-abortion justices.\n\nAnd yet, even when asked the most loaded questions, there was little discussion of abortion itself.\n\nFirst, Kamala Harris decided to pre-empt the moderators. While Sens. Warren, Biden and Sanders went back and forth over details of who will pay for their health plans and how, the entirety of Ms. Harris\u2019 response on health care was about abortion (\u201cwomen\u2019s access to reproductive health care\u201d).\n\nLater, she doubled down on her proposal to weaponize the Justice Department to strike down pro-life state laws enacted by democratically elected legislators \u2014 which made it safe for Mr. Biden to move even further to the left and endorse a similar plan. Finally, Ms. Harris bragged of her partisan grilling of Brett Kavanaugh. This could come back to haunt her, since polling conducted around the time of his confirmation showed Independents overwhelmingly disapproved of the Democrats\u2019 handling of the process.\n\nNext came Sen. Cory Booker with a sad attempt to outdo Ms. Harris in pro-abortion feminism. According to Mr. Booker, two Planned Parenthood facilities closing due to their own refusal to comply with President Trump\u2019s Protect Life Rule constitutes a crisis. His idea of establishing a White House \u201cOffice of Reproductive Freedom\u201d sounds straight out of \u201cNineteen Eighty-Four.\u201d\n\nOne by one, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, and Amy Klobuchar pledged allegiance to Roe and the Democratic orthodoxy of repealing the long-standing, bipartisan Hyde Amendment and forcing taxpayers to pay for abortion on demand.\n\nThis leaves Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard. Rep. Gabbard has been noted for alleging support for some abortion limits in the third trimester but still voiced support for \u201ccodifying\u201d Roe. This position is untenable as it is Roe and its companion decision Doe v. Bolton which make possible the United States\u2019 extreme status as one of only seven nations to allow abortion through birth. What\u2019s more, Ms. Gabbard has repeatedly voted against the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a moderate limit on abortion after five months.\n\nMs. Warren seemed to be following Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 playbook the closest. Like Clinton, who said \u201cabortion\u201d 16 times in her first speech as the Democratic Party nominee to a gathering of Planned Parenthood activists in 2016, Ms. Warren did not shy away from the a-word.\n\nStill, her appeal to the \u201chard cases\u201d that make up a tiny minority of abortions in America was reminiscent of the final debate of 2016 in which Donald Trump graphically and memorably explained what late-term abortion is \u2014 what the Democrats vote for \u2014 suggesting that if she is the nominee, President Trump could defeat her, too.\n\nMany commentators have rightly observed a rift on the pro-abortion left over how to talk about abortion. Some candidates try to walk a fine line between appeasing a far-left base and alienating mainstream Americans, including rank-and-file Democrats, with their deeply unpopular agenda.\n\nBut semantics is only part of the story. When it comes to their record, the rift disappears and they are united in lockstep with the abortion lobby. Every candidate who had the opportunity in Congress to support lifesaving medical care for babies who survive abortions has refused to do so. They have repeatedly voted yes to extreme late-term abortions. And they all want American taxpayers forced to fund unlimited abortion.\n\nIn politics, clarity is a gift. Democratic contenders are still working to keep voters in the dark about exactly how extreme they really are \u2014 and we in the pro-life movement are working to expose the truth.\n\n\u2022 Marjorie Dannenfelser is president of the national pro-life group Susan B.
