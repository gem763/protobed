We want this Test just as much as any other in this series.\u201d\n\nOn the input of Waugh, Langer and Ricky Ponting \u2013 another Australian great who was a mentor for the World Cup and has dipped into the set-up since \u2013 Paine said: \u201cYou get a lot of wisdom. They are guys who have been through what we are going through and can pass on tips to keep things in perspective. They are types of characters who make guys feel good about themselves and invincible. They have been valuable for me as a captain as well.\u201d\n\nAustralia have confirmed at least one change to their XI, dropping the middle-order batsman Travis Head \u2013 a vice\u2011captain \u2013 and bringing in Mitch Marsh as an all-rounder who can ease the workload for their tiring quicks. Peter Siddle is also in the 12 should either Pat Cummins or Josh Hazlewood need a proper breather.\n\nMarsh, a childhood friend of his similarly recalled opposite number Sam Curran, made two centuries during the 2017-18 Ashes win but was dropped in January amid a low-key Australian summer and instructions to improve his fitness.\n\nEngland drop Jason Roy and bring in Curran and Woakes for fifth Ashes Test Read more\n\n\u201cMitch got some pretty honest feedback when he was dropped,\u201d Paine said. \u201cHe had a choice to make: either to sulk about it or to do something about it, and Mitch at the moment is as fit as we\u2019ve seen him. And during this Ashes, even watching Ben Stokes go about it, we\u2019ve constantly spoken to him about him being at that level of fitness where you can bowl 25, 30 overs and then come out and score a hundred.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that Mitch has watched up close and is aspiring to. If you\u2019re a boy the size he is, it\u2019s hard to run in all day when you\u2019re carrying a few extra kilos. He\u2019s worked hard to work them off.\u201d\n\nAsked about Head, a left-hander who has struggled this series but not to the same extent as the retained David Warner, Paine replied: \u201cWe just needed the extra bowling. He\u2019s played 12 Tests with a healthy average [42]. He\u2019s a gun player with a big future. We\u2019ll go back to Australia and there\u2019s no doubt he\u2019s among our top seven batsmen.\u201d", "description": "Tim Paine has said that even with the Ashes secured at 2-1 his Australia side are \u2018very hungry\u2019 going into the fifth Test", "authors": ["Ali Martin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8a861919a9ea101b360a22caa26faa43fc329df/0_134_4596_2757/master/4596.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=86aa3c0fedbb09d1b75e0d8eeaa67261", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
