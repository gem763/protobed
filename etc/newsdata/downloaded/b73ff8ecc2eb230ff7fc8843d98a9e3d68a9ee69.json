His nose was blocked with baked blood and he was barely breathing.\n\n''We started changing his clothes and saw black bruises all over his body. One woman who was in the room fainted after seeing all this.''\n\nThe neighbours called an ambulance and the police.\n\nMykyta was rushed to intensive care where doctors are still battling for his life. Medics assume the child has skull fractures but they cannot examine him because of his grave condition.\n\nMykhailo Kulik, the head of the intensive care unit of Rivne Regional Children's Hospital said: ''The boy is in a serious life-threatening condition. We suspect that his skull is fractured but we cannot examine it now.\n\n(Image: Credit: 1+1)\n\n(Image: Credit: 1+1)\n\n''I have never seen a baby in such a terribly neglected state. I think his mother has never changed his clothes nor used diapers. His skin is in awful condition.''\n\nAfter the mother arrived home, she was taken to a police department for interrogation.\n\nPolice spokesman Anton Kruk said: ''The mother said that she was stressed out because of the baby\u2019s constant crying. She left the baby home alone and went on a date.''\n\nPolice launched a criminal case for battery and failure to fulfil parental duties against the mother.\n\nSocial service psychologist Yulia Tkachenko could not help crying after seeing the child and having a conversation with his mother.\n\nShe said: \"There are no doubts that the baby was brutally beaten up.
