According to bystanders, Felix was shot during a police raid, when a police officer mistakenly shot her while aiming at a motorcyclist. She died later in hospital.\n\nVeja reported that doctors refused to give the officers the bullet and now fear reprisals.\n\nA police officer questions a youth at Santa Marta slum in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, June 11, 2015.

Nonetheless, it added that \"possible misconduct\" by officers in the unit involved was under investigation internally and as part of the broader civil police probe into the case.\n\nRio's civil police, which carries out investigations, said there was nothing on file about the raid.\n\nThe death of Felix, the fifth child to die this year at the hands of law enforcement, caused outrage in Rio, where rising police violence has become a growing issue this year.\n\nBetween January and August 2019, Rio police killed 1,249 people, according to official figures, nearly a fifth more than a year ago. The rate amounts to 5 people per day, more for the period than any since the state began keeping its current database in 2003.\n\nCritics accuse far-right President Jair Bolsonaro and Rio Gov. Wilson Witzel, who have both advocated police take a tougher line on criminals, of emboldening police to shoot to kill.\n\n(Reporting by Gabriel Stargardter; editing by Sandra Maler)", "description": "Between January and August 2019, Rio police killed 1,249 people, or 5 people a day, which is nearly one-fifth more than a year ago.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d976cf65d21aa0ff769212a?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
