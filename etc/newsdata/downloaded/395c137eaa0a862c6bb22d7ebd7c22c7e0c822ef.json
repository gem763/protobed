He should have signed one letter, in accordance with the law.\"\n\n\"If we crash out because of what he\u2019s done with the letters, in 11 days time without a deal, he bears personal responsibility for that,\" he added.\n\nBut Johnson's government is sticking to its script.\n\nOn Sunday Michael Gove, a close adviser to Johnson, told the UK's Sky News: \"We are going to leave on October the 31st.\"\n\nGove also said the risk of no deal had increased and the government was stepping up preparations for it.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has warned that a no deal Brexit would threaten the world's economy and reduce the UK's GDP by somewhere between 3.5 percent and 5 percent.\n\nAnd the UK Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned that it would push level of government debt to their point for over 50 years.\n\nJohnson's government insist that such warning are exaggerations.", "description": "The 27 Brexit weary EU states met on Sunday and agreed they would forward a controversial letter from the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to the European Parliament this week for approval.", "authors": ["Daniel Bellamy"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/51/14/1000x563_cmsv2_ad6112a0-8e91-54af-b2d2-a55d2cc03d4e-4245114.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
