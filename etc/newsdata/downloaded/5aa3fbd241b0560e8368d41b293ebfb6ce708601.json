He always likes to create diversions,\" he said. \"I hope and pray he won't want to cause another government shutdown because it might be a diversion away from impeachment. It's very worrisome to me.\"\n\nThe federal government is currently funded through November 21. Congress must work together to pass appropriations bills to keep another shutdown from taking place. They can either pass 12 individual appropriations bills or one giant package. Either way, House Democrats and Senate Republicans will be challenged to work together amidst the impeachment inquiry fight.\n\nThe House has passed 10 appropriation bills so far this year and the Senate is expected to pass four domestic spending bills later this week. Senate Democrats, however, aren't on board with the defense spending, something Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) finds ironic given the Democrats' impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"There\u2019s no small amount of irony associated with the fact the president is apparently being impeached over in the House for holding up aid to Ukraine and at the same time Democrats are going to filibuster the defense bill which would provide for the assistance to Ukraine,\" McConnell told POLITICO.\n\nRepublicans have said they will not allow another government shutdown to take place. Some believe another stopgap bill will be passed, which could last through December or even early into 2020, The Hill reported.", "description": "Eye roll..10/29/2019 19:59:01PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/197/7c336809-445d-4dbf-85da-7c010eeb1583.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
