Speaking to Variety on the red carpet at the Toronto International Film Festival, in a video that was just released, Beetz was asked to respond to the critique, and she said: \u201cI think that it\u2019s kind of an empathy towards isolation and kind of what is our duty as a society to address people who\u2019ve slipped through the cracks in a way.\u201d\n\nShe later described the film as \u201cmore of an observation on personalities who struggle.\u201d\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nIn the film, Beetz plays Sophie Dumond, a cynical single mother and purported love interest to Arthur Fleck (played by Joaquin Phoenix). A self-professed \u201chuge fan\u201d of Phoenix, Beetz previously said it was \u201can honor\u201d to co-star with him, and that she learned a lot from the actor while on set.\n\nDebate about \u201cJoker\u201d has shifted from its merits as a film to concerns that its main character might inspire real-world violence from men in similar psychological states.\n\nDirector Todd Phillips has expressed surprise at the backlash, stating, \u201cI think it\u2019s because outrage is a commodity, I think it\u2019s something that has been a commodity for a while [\u2026] What\u2019s outstanding to me in this discourse in this movie is how easily the far left can sound like the far right when it suits their agenda. It\u2019s really been eye-opening for me.\u201d\n\nPhoenix recently walked out of an interview when asked if the film could inspire mass shooters. Following that incident, journalists were disinvited from the film\u2019s Los Angeles premiere at TCL Chinese Theatre, with only photographers being allowed to interact with the filmmakers and cast on the carpet. In a statement, Warner Bros. said: \u201cA lot has been said about Joker, and we just feel it\u2019s time for people to see the film.\u201d\n\nAn origin story set in 1981, the film follows Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill failed stand-up comedian who turns to a life of crime and chaos in Gotham City. In addition to Phoenix and Beetz, Robert De Niro, Frances Conroy, Brett Cullen, Glenn Fleshler, Bill Camp, Shea Whigham, and Marc Maron round out the main cast.\n\n\u201cJoker\u201d opened to blowout box office this weekend, earning $93.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $140.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $234 million.\n\nBest of IndieWire\n\nSign up for Indiewire's Newsletter.
