Many are struggling with lost wages because restaurants or other businesses that pay by the hour temporarily closed.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re facing, what am I going to feed my kids if I can\u2019t cook and this food is spoiled? And how will I feed my kids next week?\u201d Kuhn said.\n\nMeanwhile, solar companies are seeing a spike in interest from customers seeking alternatives for when the power fails.\n\nSunrun, which leases and sells solar energy systems, said traffic to its web page which explains how to power through blackouts with its solar and battery systems increased 1,500% over the past few days.\n\nRetired firefighter Derek Krause, who lives in Oakland, leases solar panels and a battery from Sunrun for about $150 a month, which includes the cost of electricity.\n\nKrause didn\u2019t realize this week\u2019s power outage had hit his neighborhood because his backup power kicked in when his neighbors\u2019 lights turned off. PG&E\u2019s promise to cut power more frequently was one of the reasons he decided to install the system in February.\n\n\u201cHaving taught the public about self-sustainability during emergencies, it was important to me,\u201d Krause said.\n\nBuying a solar energy system that can run during a blackout can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Solar panels alone won\u2019t do the trick; an internal switch turns the panels off during a power outage to prevent the panels from sending electricity to wires around the home. Having a battery solves that problem, but also adds to the cost.\n\nIn Paradise, the Northern California town that was decimated last year by wildfires that killed 85 people, many of the remaining residents have generators that they\u2019ve tapped for power during several planned power outages that PG&E enacted there this year.\n\nThey often make light of the situation, posting pictures on social media of power cords winding through their homes, said Councilman Michael Zuccolillo.\n\nZuccolillo bought a $500 gasoline-powered generator from Costco and goes through two or three gallons of gasoline a day, using it to power his refrigerator, television, lights and phone chargers.\n\n\u201cIn the morning, we have one cord, and we switch it around between the coffee pot and the toaster,\u201d Zuccolillo said.\n\nMany portable generators cost $1,000 or more, and permanent standby generators cost at least $2,000, with an installation price tag that can cost $10,000 or more, according to Consumer Reports.\n\nSolar panels and generators aren\u2019t necessarily an option for people who rent apartments.\n\n\u201cI think those are the last things people are thinking about when they\u2019re on a limited income,\u201d Kuhn said.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, many tech companies have backup power to ensure that critical servers or systems don\u2019t go down. Some entrepreneurs who run tech companies out of their homes have uninterrupted power supplies, or standby generators fueled by natural gas, said Daniel Aldrich, director of the master\u2019s program in security and resilience at Northeastern University. But many people simply can\u2019t afford those options.\n\n\u201cTimes like these, they always reveal what\u2019s actually going on in society, or they accelerate the existing trends,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cFor the normal people in California, blue-collar people, people on nebulizers or oxygen machines \u2026 for the people who are vulnerable, those individuals, now their lives might be at risk.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Writers Barbara Ortutay and Olga Rodriguez in San Francisco contributed to this report.", "description": "When the nation's largest utility warned customers that it would cut power to nearly 2 million people across Northern California, many rushed out to buy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/13/4256aa_california-wildfires-power-shutoff-02210-view-electrical-power-lines-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
