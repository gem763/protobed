He has not played rugby union since being sacked and is currently seeking a return to sport with the Tongan national rugby league team.\n\nConfusion reigns over Israel Folau's potential return to rugby league | Matt Cleary Read more\n\nIn documents filed in the federal circuit court, RA alleges that \u201cMr Folau, through his senior counsel, conceded that his conduct in making the 2019 Posts constituted a breach of [the rules]\u201d and \u201coffered to make a public apology for the 2019 Posts\u201d.\n\n\u201cBefore the Tribunal, Mr Folau conceded that his posts had breached the Code of Conduct, conceded that the posts had the potential to cause damage to Rugby Australia\u2019s relationship with sponsors, and conceded that he knew, at the time of posting, that transgender and homosexual persons may have been offended by the posts,\u201d RA says in court documents.\n\n\u201cDespite his concession that the posts breached the Code of Conduct, Mr Folau refused to take down the posts.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemarkably, despite his concession before the Tribunal that he had breached the Code of Conduct, Mr Folau now seeks to argue that his posts did not breach the Code of Conduct,\u201d RA later says in the documents.\n\nRA says in its documents Folau was \u201cthe highest paid, and one of the highest profile, players in Australia\u201d and that his contract required him to be \u201can ambassador for the game of rugby in Australia\u201d.\n\nIt claimed Folau had accepted his views were likely to make sponsors feel \u201cvery uneasy\u201d.\n\nIn Folau\u2019s statement of claim, filed in August, the rugby star said he had suffered \u201closs and damage\u201d over his sacking, which he argues was unlawful.\n\nFolau accuses RA of sacking him for his religion and political views and demands that he is reinstated.\n\n\u201c\u2026 Mr Folau can no longer play rugby union at an international level (because he is only eligible to play for the Wallabies) or for an Australian team in the Super Rugby competition and [the sanction] is therefore an unreasonable restraint of trade, contrary to public policy, and void,\u201d the document says.\n\nThe legal action comes as Folau\u2019s playing future continues to be shrouded in mystery, after reports he will line up for Tonga in rugby league tests against Australia and Great Britain were denied by the sport\u2019s international governing body.", "description": "Prior to suing Rugby Australia over his firing, Folau allegedly agreed the posts had breached his contract", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20c368cbc0160da84677889da37266ab5e788a01/0_51_2394_1436/master/2394.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8159c0ab69f4a214afec45a0f2627c8a", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
