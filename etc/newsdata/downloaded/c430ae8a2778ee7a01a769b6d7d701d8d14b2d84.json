AP\n\nThe remarks provide a different take to a persistent theme of the ECB president during his final months in office, calling for European governments who can afford to loosen purse strings to do so in support of economic growth. Draghi told reporters at his most recent press conference that \"it's high time for the fiscal policy to take charge\".\n\n\"Fiscal policy becomes more powerful when monetary policy is close to the effective lower bound, as the multipliers are higher,\" the ECB president said. \"Furthermore, in certain situations, supportive fiscal policy can complement monetary policy in cutting through the obstacles that are weighing on demand -- which is the case in the euro area today.\"\n\nDraghi also built on other recent comments calling for enhanced coordination of budget policies in the euro region, while reiterating his insistence on more spending. He said that net public investment in all large euro countries \"has essentially been zero over the last decade\".", "description": "The ECB boss reiterated his call for European governments to loosen their purse strings in order to bolster economic growth.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3527%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_101/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/aa9dbdc5c8ba2a63196ffef08731b7f43164b9ed", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
