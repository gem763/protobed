One of the protesters told Reuters he hoped it would inspire Hong Kong people to keep fighting.\n\n\"We are telling people that you mustn't give up. All problems can be resolved with Hong Kong people's persistence and hard work to reach our aims,\" he said.\n\nHong Kong has been battered by four months of often massive and violent protests against what is seen as Beijing's tightening grip on the Chinese-ruled city, and more protests are planned for Sunday.\n\nPetrol bombs were thrown inside a Hong Kong metro rail station on Saturday but no one was injured, the government said.\n\nThe MTR, which usually carries some 5 million people daily, will shut early on Sunday and the Airport Express will not stop between central Hong Kong and the airport.\n\nMetro stations have been torched and ticketing machines damaged because protesters believe MTR management, at the instruction of the government, has closed stations to hinder protesters' movements. It was forced to shut down completely last week.\n\n\n\n\n\nCRISIS\n\nThe protests started in opposition to a now-abandoned extradition bill but have widened into a pro-democracy movement and an outlet for anger at social inequality in the city, which boasts some of the world's most expensive real estate.\n\nThe unrest has plunged the city into its worst crisis since Britain handed it back to China in 1997 and poses the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.\n\nProtesters believe China has been eroding Hong Kong's freedoms, guaranteed under a \"one country, two systems\" formula introduced with the 1997 handover.\n\nThe now-withdrawn extradition bill, under which residents would have been sent to Communist-controlled mainland courts, was seen as the latest move to tighten control.\n\nChina denies the accusation and says foreign countries, including Britain and the United States, are fomenting unrest.\n\nAfter almost a week of relative calm, following some of the worst violence since the unrest started, hundreds of protesters wearing face masks staged a peaceful march in Kowloon on Sunday, with only a small group trashing shops and mainland China banks.\n\nThe government said petrol bombs were thrown into the entrance of the Kowloon Tong station and a Kowloon government office was set on fire.\n\nRiot police deployed to the streets but protesters had dispersed without any major confrontation by late Sunday night.\n\nThe Hong Kong government introduced colonial-era emergency laws last week to ban the wearing of face masks at public rallies, a move that sparked some of the worst violence since the unrest started in June.\n\nPolice have arrested more than 2,300 people since June. Since September, nearly 40% were under the age of 18 and 10% under 15.\n\nProtesters accuse police of using excessive force, claims which they deny. Two protesters have been shot and wounded during skirmishes with police.\n\nHong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade due to the protests, with tourism and retail hardest hit.
