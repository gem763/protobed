REI is canceling Black Friday this year. No promotions, no hourly sales, no doorbusters, no waiting in line. USA TODAY\n\nWhile other retailers will be encouraging shoppers to take advantage of Black Friday deals to save some green, REI wants them to go outside and experience green.\n\nFor the fifth year, the Seattle-based outdoor retailer will close its stores the day after Thanksgiving \u2013 considered one of the biggest shopping days of the year \u2013 as part of its #OptOutside initiative. It won't process online payments but will pay its 13,000 employees, the company announced Wednesday.\n\nBut this year, the co-op, which stands for Recreational Equipment Inc., is taking the initiative further and asking its employees and 18 million members to \"opt to act\" and join a nationwide clean-up effort, CEO Eric Artz told USA TODAY. Locations of environmental cleanups will be posted on the REI website, www.rei.com.\n\nDon't dawdle: It's time to shop for Thanksgiving, Christmas flights\n\nDollar wars: Amazon declares war on Dollar Tree and Dollar General: Analysis\n\n\"We\u2019re still going to go outside and play \u2013 but this time we\u2019re bringing our work gloves. And we\u2019re inviting you to join us,\" Artz wrote in a letter to members. \"It\u2019s time to fight for life outdoors \u2013 and life on this planet.\"\n\nREI stores will be closed on Thanksgiving, too, bucking another trend of earlier holiday sales.\n\nREI started #OptOutside in 2015 and has been working toward zero-waste operations and challenging the industry to eliminate unnecessary packaging.\n\nArtz, who became CEO in May, said he wanted to take \u201ca bolder stand on climate and climate change.\" However, Artz said it's about more than one day and the company is launching a year of actions with the Opt to Act plan.\n\n\u201cThis is a first step in a new journey for us, because we also will be launching 52 weeks of climate action where we will be inviting consumers on a weekly basis into the small steps that each and every one of us can be taking to live a life that\u2019s kinder to the planet,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kelly Tyko on Twitter: @KellyTyko\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/22/black-friday-store-closings-2019-rei-optoutside-initiative/4063598002/", "description": "REI will close its stores on Black Friday \u2013 considered one of the biggest shopping days of the year\u00a0\u2013 as part of its #OptOutside initiative.", "authors": ["Kelly Tyko", "Published A.M.
