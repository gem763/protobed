Children have been acting inappropriately for eternity, the only difference now is we can call them out on it because of all the evidence they leave behind. Taking their phones away won't stop the behavior, it'll just stop teachers and parents from finding out,' one woman posted.\n\nAnother added: 'It's harmless fun, at least they are at school.'\n\nSome videos on the app show students simulating sexual and explicit acts in the classroom\n\nXavier College took immediate action when it became aware of students featured in videos last term.\n\nThe action included counselling and disciplinary measures.\n\n'The incident highlights the need to continue our ongoing educative process of equipping our young people to be more responsible and safe users of all technology,' a spokeswoman told Seven News.\n\nXavier College's mobile phone policy available on the school's website states devices will be confiscated if students are found to be using them inappropriately.\n\n'Further disciplinary action will be taken should the student re-offend,' the policy states.\n\nSA shadow education minister Jayne Stimson (pictured left with former prime minister Julia Gillard) wants to enforce a ban on mobile phones in schools after viewing disturbing videos\n\nImmanuel College, an exclusive boarding school in Adelaide is also aware of footage of students on the popular app.\n\n'As soon as we became aware at Immanuel that there were TikToks on the app in which our students were featured, we communicated with our full student body to ensure that they understood this was against our policies and that there was a significant privacy risk for students,' Steve Blight said.\n\nSome believe a mobile phone ban isn't the answer.\n\nEducation Minister John Gardner said the department supports schools enforcing phone bans, but doesn't believe a blanket ban will address the problem.\n\nLaunched in late 2017, TikTok has more than 500 million active users worldwide.\n\nPopular video app TikTok has taken the online world by storm in the last two years\n\nThe app describes itself as the destination for short-form mobile videos with a mission to 'capture and present the world's creativity, knowledge, and precious life moments.'\n\nDaily Mail Australia has contacted TikTok for comment.\n\nIt comes as Western Australia announced a ban on mobile phone use during school hours at public schools.\n\nStudents will also be prohibited from using smart watches, ear buds and tablets during class.\n\nThose who contravene the rules will be forced to hand over the device to be returned at the end of the day.\n\nThere will be some exemptions including students being allowed to confirm shifts with their after-school employer.\n\nEducation minister Sue Ellery believes the ban will reduce distraction from studies and encourage face-to-face social interaction.", "description": "Several of Adelaide's most prestigious schools confirmed they're aware of disturbing online video featuring their students in school uniform.
