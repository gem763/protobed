I'd say the rest of my life depended on this.\"\n\nGazza also feared for the work opportunities he has lined up, with those jobs resting on the result of his court case - while he's confirmed they will still go ahead.\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.", "description": "Paul Gascoigne, known as Gazza, was cleared of sexual assault charges in court this month, with him fighting back tears as he discussed his 'year of hell'", "authors": ["Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Itv", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20703531.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EH_CHP_231019gazza_1731JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
