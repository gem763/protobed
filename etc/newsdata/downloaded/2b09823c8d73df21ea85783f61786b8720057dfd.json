It puts the dog's face over that of James McCloughan, a Vietnam veteran the president gave the Medal of Honor to in 2017.\n\nThe image features a watermark for The Daily Wire, which brands itself as the 'largest conservative news site in America' and was founded by Ben Shapiro, the 35-year-old Los Angeles-based political pundit.\n\nPresident Trump shared a photoshopped image of himself giving a military medal to the dog that cornered ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi during this weekend's raid\n\nThe image is a combination of the official government photo of the dog (left) and Trump awarding the Medal of Honor to James McCloughan (right), a Vietnam vet, in 2017\n\nThe president will give a Medal of Honor to a human later Wednesday. He'll be giving the top military honor to Master Sgt. Matthew Williams, who showed great bravery in Afghanistan\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment about the photoshopped image's origins.\n\nMcCloughan was the first veteran awarded a Medal of Honor during Trump's time as president.\n\nAt age 23 on May 19, 1969, McCloughan ran into the line of fire during the Battle of Nui Yon Hill to save 10 soldiers and one Vietnamese person.\n\nFive of the soldiers he saved were present for his August 2017 White House ceremony.\n\n'It was as if the strength and the pride of our whole nation were beating inside Jim's heart. He just kept on going,' Trump commented at the time.\n\nThis week, the president latched on to the dog's story during the victory lap he took over the successful al-Baghdadi raid.\n\n'We have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi!' the president tweeted Monday.\n\nWhile the Pentagon has not officially released the dog's name, Newsweek reported that the dog is named Conan.\n\nThe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley said Monday that the dog was 'still in theater,' adding that the pooch was 'slightly wounded and fully recovering.'\n\nWhite House officials did not give additional details on when the dog might come to the White House Wednesday, which would make Trump's photoshopped tweet a reality.\n\nThe president, however, will soon be hanging a medal around a human's neck.\n\nTrump is due to present the Medal of Honor to Master Sgt. Matthew Williams at 5 p.m. this afternoon.\n\nWilliams is receiving the top award for the bravery he showed in helping his wounded comrades get off a mountain during an April 2008 battle in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Lois Pope K-9 Medal of Courage had been one way to reward military dogs, according to the Military Times.\n\nThough earlier this year, the Defense Department established the Military Working Dog Certificate of Commendation program, whiich recognizes the actions of both dogs and handlers.\n\n'Each respective military department is responsible for awarding the MWD Handler Certificate of Certification of Commendation in accordance with established award criteria,' a spokeswoman for the Pentagon told DailyMail.com.", "description": "President Trump tweeted a photoshopped image of him placing a medal around the neck of Conan, the hero dog who chased down ISIS leader\u00a0Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi before he blew himself up.", "authors": ["Nikki Schwab", "Senior U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/20/20393650-0-image-a-134_1572466046130.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
