The offer is 19% higher than Dream Global\u2019s closing price Friday in Toronto. The stock jumped 17% to C$16.57 Monday.\n\nDream Global, which went public in 2011, operates office and industrial properties across Western Europe. The offer values the equity of the company at about C$3.2 billion.\n\n\u201cThis transaction is an exciting opportunity for Blackstone to expand its existing office and logistics portfolios in some of the largest and most important markets in the region,\u201d said James Seppala, head of Backstone\u2019s real estate in Europe.\n\nThe deal comes less than a week after Blackstone separately said it raised $20.5 billion for its largest real estate fund ever. The private equity industry\u2019s largest real estate investor held a final close on Blackstone Real Estate Partners IX. The amount gathered is more than the $15.8 billion raised by the 2015 pool.\n\nToronto-Dominion Bank and National Bank of Canada were the financial advisers on the deal, which requires two-thirds support of Toronto-based Dream Global\u2019s shareholders.\n\n(Adds share price)\n\n--With assistance from Robert Tuttle.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: David Scanlan in Toronto at dscanlan@bloomberg.net;Thuy Ong in Sydney at hong35@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Scanlan at dscanlan@bloomberg.net, Katrina Nicholas\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Blackstone Group Inc. added new properties in Germany and The Netherlands with the purchase of a Canadian real estate trust, in deal valued at C$6.2 billion ($4.7 billion) including debt.The New York-based private equity firm agreed to pay C$16.79 a share in cash for Dream Global Real", "authors": ["David Scanlan", "Thuy Ong"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Rzm5rgTWg38p18tkROMncw--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/586cd465b8bf3006bc1330157c3ab8b1", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
