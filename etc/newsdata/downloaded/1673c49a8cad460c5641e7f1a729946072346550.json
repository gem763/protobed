(Cliff Owen/AP)\n\nJames Robertson, a federal judge who drew national attention for his ruling on the rights of a foreign detainee in U.S. custody at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and his resignation from a judicial surveillance panel to protest warrantless federal wiretapping, died Sept. 7 at a hospital in Washington. He was 81.\n\nThe cause was a heart ailment, said a son, Stephen Robertson.\n\nJudge Robertson was a U.S. District Court Judge in Washington from 1994 to 2010. His resignation from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in 2005, three years into his appointment, followed media revelations that the Bush administration had bypassed the court by failing to obtain warrants in its gathering of information from U.S. electronic communications carriers in its war on terrorism.\n\nThe administration\u2019s actions came at a time of heightened anxiety over national security that followed the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. To the Bush administration, the warrantless wiretapping practice was \u201cthe terrorist surveillance program.\u201d\n\nBefore serving on the federal bench, he was a corporate lawyer from 1965 to 1994 with the Washington firm now known as WilmerHale. Among his early assignments was representing the Automobile Manufacturer\u2019s Association in the wake of car-safety violations uncovered by consumer activist Ralph Nader.\n\nIn 1969, he took a leave from the firm to run the Jackson, Miss., office of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a Washington-based nonprofit group that brings private lawyers in campaigns for civil and human rights.\n\n\n\nJudge Robertson, shown in 2008, served president of the D.C. Bar Association in 1991 and 1992, helping to establish a process for the hiring of young minority lawyers by the white-shoe law firms. (Charles Dharapak/AP)\n\nJudge Robertson described himself in an oral history for Columbia University as a \u201cdelegate from the establishment. I came from a recognized firm. I wasn\u2019t a radical. I wasn\u2019t a long-haired hippie. I understood authority and how it worked.\u201d\n\nSome of his most important cases, he said, were low-profile and set no universal legal precedent but related directly to workaday life and injustice in the rural South.\n\n\u201cIn one case,\u201d he said, \u201ca black minister was charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor because he appeared at the door of the jail with his Sunday school choir to ask about a black man that he had heard was being beaten in the jail.\n\n\u201cThe jailer then arrested him and his whole choir,\u201d Judge Robertson continued, \u201cput them in the jailhouse upstairs, maced them through the bars of the jail \u2014 they opened the windows and started singing \u2018We Shall Overcome,\u2019 crowds gathered in the courthouse, the highway patrol were called in to keep order, and the denouement of all this was a charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, a 12-year-old girl \u2014 to wit, by \u2018causing her to be in a bad place,\u2019 namely, the jail.\n\n\u201cThat case, believe it or not, went to trial,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd, of course, the minister was convicted, but we got it reversed on appeal.\u201d\n\nAnother case, he said, involved the time-honored stratagem of getting the right jury and a twist on a line from the English poet Alexander Pope, \u201cWretches hang that jurymen may dine.\u201d\n\nThe matter involved a black defendant charged with assault to kill a sheriff\u2019s deputy and a jury \u2014 of two blacks and 10 whites \u2014 that began considering the case around Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201c \u2018If we have to be here until Easter, we\u2019re going to be here until Easter, We\u2019re voting to acquit,\u2019 \u201d Judge Robertson quoted the black jurors as having said. \u201cThey out-waited the white folks. . . . The white folks all said, \u2018Oh, to hell with it. We\u2019ll vote to acquit.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSuch cases, Judge Robertson said, could become \u201ca catalyst for community organization. All civil rights movements are local. . . . They were town by town, county by county.\u201d\n\nAfter three years in Mississippi, Judge Robertson returned to his firm in Washington and became partner in 1973. He would remember those years in the South as defining elements in his legal career. As president of the D.C. Bar Association in 1991 and 1992, he helped establish a process for the hiring of young minority lawyers by the white-shoe law firms.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton appointed him to the federal bench in 1994. A decade into his tenure, he ruled in a major case regarding a Yemeni prisoner, Salim Ahmed Hamdan, who was being held at the U.S. military detention center at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. Hamdan, a chauffeur for al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden, had been seized during the American invasion of Afghanistan and imprisoned by the U.S. military.\n\nA military tribunal designated Hamdan an enemy combatant, even as Hamdan challenged his detention with a writ of habeas petition before Judge Robertson\u2019s court. The judge ruled in Hamdan\u2019s favor, saying the government had neglected to determine if Hamdan was a prisoner of war, as required by the Geneva Conventions, before trying him by the commission.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court upheld Judge Robertson\u2019s ruling in 2006 in a decision largely focused on whether the president or Congress had explicit authorization or inherent power to establish a military commission with the right to try those charged with war crimes in the post-9/11 war on terror.\n\nAlthough Hamdan was later tried and convicted under new rules, he was released to Yemen in 2008.\n\nIn 2002, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist named Judge Robertson to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a secretive intelligence court of 11 judges that authorizes surveillance on U.S. soil if a target is shown to be an agent of a foreign power.\n\nThe court was created in 1978 in the wake of revelations of abuses involving domestic spying by U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies, as a way to balance privacy and civil liberties against national security imperatives.\n\nThe 2001 al-Qaeda-sponsored attacks on the United States, which killed nearly 3,000 people, sparked a renewed urgency to fight international terrorism by any means possible, including the hunt for communications records that might help federal agents connect dots and prevent another catastrophe.\n\nAfter his resignation, Judge Robertson spoke critically of how the court\u2019s mission had strayed from its straightforward duty to approve or turn down a warrant application, particularly after Congress passed amendments in 2008 to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which had set up the court. The new legislation allowed the government to conduct domestic surveillance without warrants in some cases and granted the court interpretive powers.\n\n\u201cThat change, in my view, turned the FISA court into something like an administrative agency that makes rules for others to follow,\u201d Judge Robertson said at an oversight hearing in 2013. \u201cThat\u2019s not the bailiwick of judges. Judges don\u2019t make policy.\u201d\n\nAt the hearing, some critics of the surveillance court said the judges were largely Republican appointees who acted as a rubber stamp for the national security community. Hearings consisted of government lawyers and the judges, and Judge Robertson was among those suggesting that the process had become too one-sided.\n\n\u201cAnyone who has been a judge will tell you a judge needs to hear both sides of a case before deciding,\u201d Judge Robertson said. \u201cThis process needs an adversary.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Congress passed the USA Freedom Act, which empowered the court to appoint \u201camicus curiae,\u201d or individuals with expertise in privacy and civil liberties, telecommunications or any area that may assist the judge in cases involving a \u201cnovel or significant interpretation\u201d of the law.\n\nJames Robertson was born in Cleveland on May 18, 1938, and grew up in Oberlin, Ohio, and Dayton, Ohio. His father was a banker, and his mother a social worker. He graduated from Princeton University in 1959, served in the Navy and received a law degree from George Washington University in 1965.\n\nIn 1959 he married Berit Persson. In addition to his wife, of Washington, survivors include three children, Stephen Robertson of Los Altos, Calif., Catherine Robertson of Washington and Peter Robertson of Cleveland; a twin sister; and six grandchildren.\n\nAway from the courtroom, Judge Robertson was an amateur photographer, a singer and guitar player, a sailor, and a do-it-yourself handyman who made bookcases and other household items.\n\nThirty-three young lawyers clerked for him during his years as a judge and they remained lifelong friends. He presided at the weddings of eight of his former law clerks, including one nuptial where both bride and groom had been his clerks.\n\n\u201cI think of this as an arranged marriage. I arranged it,\u201d he said at the time.", "description": "He drew national attention in 2005 by resigning from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to protest warrantless wiretaps by the Bush Administration.", "authors": ["Bart Barnes", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/spnMMlENCWe-DeLwnLygBtCe3hk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EMTE3NWWKUI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
