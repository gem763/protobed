The offensive has displaced at least 130,000 people.\n\n'There is blood on Trump's hands for abandoning our Kurdish allies,' Allen, who was the former commander of American forces in Afghanistan, told CNN.\n\n'I said there would be blood, but could not have imagined this outcome.'\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday ruled out any mediation in the dispute with the Kurds, saying Turkey wouldn't negotiate with 'terrorists'.\n\n'There was no chance Erdogan would keep his promise, and full blown ethnic cleansing is underway by Turkish supported militias,' Allen said.\n\n'This is what happens when Trump follows his instincts and because of his alignment with autocrats.'\n\nTrump said in a tweet on Sunday morning that he is in talks with members of congress to impose 'powerful sanctions' on Turkey while Erdogan continues his attacks on Kurdish militia.\n\n'Dealing with @LindseyGrahamSC and many members of Congress, including Democrats, about imposing powerful Sanctions on Turkey,' Trump tweeted.\n\n'Treasury is ready to go, additional legislation may be sought. There is great consensus on this. Turkey has asked that it not be done. Stay tuned!'\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper also said on Sunday that all American troops will withdraw from northern Syria because of the increasing danger of getting caught in the crossfire.\n\nOn Sunday, Turkey targeted two border towns with shelling, continuing with the fight against Kurdish militia\n\nMore than 130,000 people have been displaced from rural areas around the northeast Syrian border towns of Tel Abyad (pictured today) and Ras al Ain as a result of fighting between Turkish-led forces and Kurdish militia\n\nAnkara launched the cross-border assault against the YPG militia after US President Donald Trump withdrew troops from the border region. Pictured: Map shows Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain (Sari Kani) near Raqqa\n\n'We have American forces likely caught between two opposing advancing armies, and it's a very untenable situation,' he said on CBS' Face the Nation.\n\nHe did not say how many would withdraw or where they would go but that they represent most of the 1,000 U.S. troops in Syria.\n\nThe peril to American forces was illustrated on Friday when a small number of U.S. troops came under Turkish artillery fire at an observation post in the north. No Americans were hurt. Esper said it was unclear whether that was an accident.\n\nTrump, in a tweet, said: 'Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change. Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made.'\n\nLater in the day Sunday, Kurdish officials announced they will work with the Syrian government to fend off the Turkish invasion, deploying side by side along the border. Syrian TV said government troops were moving to the north to confront the Turkish invasion but gave no details.\n\nThe Kurdish fighters had few options after the United States abandoned them, and it had been anticipated they would turn to Assad's government for support.\n\nA return by Assad's forces to the region where Syrian Kurds have built up autonomy in the north would be a major shift in Syria's long-running civil war, further cementing Assad's hold over the ravaged country.\n\nPresident Trump says he is in talks with both members of congress to impose 'powerful sanctions' on Turkey\n\nOn Sunday Trump continued to defend his decision to pull U.S. troops from Syria, writing: 'Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change'\n\nPresident Trump continued to double down on his decision to abandon the Kurds\n\nIt would also mean that U.S. troops no longer have a presence in an area where Russia and Iranian-backed militias now have a role.\n\nIt was not clear what Russia's role was in cementing the agreement. But Russian officials have been mediating low-level talks between the Kurds and Damascus. Syria is allied with Russia, and Turkey, though it is a NATO member, has drawn close to Moscow in recent years under Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe U.S. withdrawal leaves open the question of what happens to the Kurdish-run prisons and detention centers that hold thousands of Islamic State prisoners, including more than 2,000 foreign militants.\n\nOn Sunday, heavy fighting reached a Kurdish-run displaced-persons camp in Ein Eissa, some 20 miles south of the border, that is home to some 12,000 people, including around 1,000 wives and widows of Islamic State fighters and their children.\n\nThe Kurdish-led administration in northern Syria said in a statement that 785 Islamic State supporters escaped after attacking guards and storming the gates. It was not immediately possible to confirm that figure.\n\n'It gets worse by the hour,' Esper said of the fighting. 'These are all the exact things' that U.S. officials warned Erdogan would probably happen in urging him not to invade.", "description": "Retired four-star Marine general John Allen told CNN on Sunday that the U.S. 'greenlighted' the current situation in Syria after President Trump ordered troops to withdraw.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/00/19670208-0-image-a-32_1571008637029.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
