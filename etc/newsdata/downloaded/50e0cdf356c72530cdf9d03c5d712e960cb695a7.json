The whole concept came from that, with the intention it would be a one-off.\u201d\n\n(Image: Stuart Nicol Photograph)\n\n(Image: MoonWalk Scotland 2016/PA)\n\nWhat Nina did not know then was that she herself already had breast cancer \u2013 an aggressive tumour that had been growing for three years.\n\nHer awareness raised, she found it while taking a shower, two months after her New York escapade had caught the public\u2019s imagination and raised \u00a325,000.\n\nNina recalls: \u201cI sort of became one of the people I was raising money for.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I was expecting at all. It was a lot to take in.\u201d\n\nNina\u2019s first modest power walk in 1996 has expanded into Walk the Walk, the charity that stages London\u2019s annual MoonWalk.\n\nThat was born when half the group failed to land a London Marathon place \u2013 so they held their walk the night before, to hand over the baton as the race started next morning.\n\nIt has grown from an initial 35 to 15,000 women, strolling 26 miles through the night in little more than their bras.\n\nAnother MoonWalk is also held in Edinburgh.\n\n(Image: Matt Dickens)\n\nIn recognition of her achievements, London\u2019s Royal Marsden Hospital opened the Nina Barough Pathology Laboratory in 2004.\n\nAfter her devastating diagnosis, Nina quit her styling and fashion business as she went through a year of treatment, including a mastectomy and radiotherapy.\n\nShe says: \u201cIt was a huge shock. I was only in my 40s.\n\n\u201cI thought, I shouldn\u2019t have this thing. I was healthy, and now my body had let me down.\n\n(Image: London MoonWalk)\n\n\u201cI was incredibly squeamish about cancer. People didn\u2019t talk about it. And suddenly I was in this world that I didn\u2019t understand and had no control over.\n\n\u201cPeople meet me and say how confident I am, but I didn\u2019t feel confident. I felt very vulnerable and out of sync.\n\n\u201cBut I thought, the fitter I am, the quicker I\u2019ll heal. There was no evidence at the time to suggest that\u2019s right \u2013 but of course now there is.\n\n\"I had a goal to eat really well and be fit, so there would be nowhere in me where cancer could live. That\u2019s what kept me going.\u201d\n\nToday, Nina is 63 and cancer free. But she says having the disease paved the way to the happiness she now has.\n\nShe smiles: \u201cIt was the end of a life \u2013 but the beginning of a new life.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I had cancer I met my husband, I had my daughter, and Walk the Walk flourished.\n\n\u201cSo it was a very difficult place, but it put me in a position where my life changed for the better.\u201d\n\nThrough the charity she met husband Guy Aubertin, and they have an 11-year-old daughter.\n\nNina says: \u201cI didn\u2019t have a job when I got the all-clear. It\u2019s quite scary. I felt lost in the world \u2013 so I just kept on walking, and that was a mixed blessing.\n\n\u201cIn a way I\u2019d found what I was going to do, but I didn\u2019t recognise it yet.\u201d\n\nHer charity work has led to a friendship with Prince Charles, who she met in 2001 when she and 40 other women from Walk the Walk were invited to Highgrove.\n\nThey all arrived in their bras. Nina, wearing a conical creation, decided to hug the Prince \u2013 and three years later he became a patron of the charity.\n\nNina, who will walk her 20th New York Marathon next month, says: \u201cHis ethos is very much in line with ours.\n\n\u201cHe has this profound belief that as human beings we can do so much for ourself, we can be in charge of our own destiny. He\u2019s a wonderful man.\u201d\n\nNina says her cancer taught her to make time for those things she values.\n\n\u201cSpending time with my daughter, that\u2019s the most precious thing for me,\u201d she says. But she admits her whole trajectory has been \u201cbizarre\u201d.\n\nShe says: \u201cI\u2019d never have found the tumour had I not done that fundraiser.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s strange, as it\u2019s such a bizarre thing to dream. If you have a good idea, hold on to it \u2013 you just never know\u2026\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Nina Barough dreamt she walked the New York Marathon in a bra - now she counts Prince Charles among supporters", "authors": ["Scarlet Howes", "Image", "Stuart Nicol Photograph", "Moonwalk Scotland Pa", "Matt Dickens", "London Moonwalk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20466070.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Nina-Barough.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
