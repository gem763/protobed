When he went to the Cheetahs, he did the same thing, and at the Sharks, he is one of their best finishers.\"\n\nStick added that work had been done on getting Mapimpi into space against the bigger sides in world rugby, pointing to the 23-13 loss to the All Blacks in South Africa's tournament opener as an example of a day when things did not go according to plan.\n\n\"We were guilty in that New Zealand game for not really converting the possession we had into points. Using the ball in the wider channels was also something we didn\u2019t do in that game,\" he said.\n\n\"That was a big work-on for us going forward in the World Cup, and in a couple of games where we did have opportunities - and the contestable kicking game creates opportunities - you might get Makazole running against a forward, or a 20-metre space to run into.\n\n\"Hopefully this week, they will get some opportunities.\"\n\nKick-off on Sunday is at 11:00 (SA time).\n\n- Compiled by Lloyd Burnard", "description": "Springbok wing Makazole Mapimpi's impressive international try scoring spree has continued at the 2019 Rugby World Cup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9328/d20e7115ee804b0693560c96889c5f39.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
