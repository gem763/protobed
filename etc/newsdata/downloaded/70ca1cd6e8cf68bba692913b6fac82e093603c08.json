Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst with Hargreaves Lansdown, asked about the UK economic outlook, said: \u201c It is very difficult to pinpoint at this stage because we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the election. If you look at what is expected at the moment, a stronger Conservative government, then actually I think markets would probably react quite positively to that. But I think there is still a lot of electioneering to go, and the one thing that we have learned recently is not to predict the outcome of political events.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAs we know, polling is not an exact science and there are probably many spills and thrills to come over the next six to seven weeks or so.\u201d\n\nUncertainty was also the problem for the currency, the pound, depending on how Britain\u2019s negotiations to leave the European Union go and what effect that has on the UK economy.\n\nSterling had surged to a six-month high against the US dollar on Tuesday but towards the end of trading in London on Wednesday it slipped.\n\nThe shares of bigger British companies are vulnerable to a rising pound because more than two-thirds of FTSE 100 company earnings are derived from operations overseas.", "description": "There further volatility in financial markets on Wednesday following the surprise general election announcement by Britain's prime minister.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/363621/1000x563_363621.jpg", "published_at": "2017-04-19"}
