The push is further adding to Lebanon's severe financial and economic crisis, with Lebanese officials warning the country's economy and banking sector can\u2019t take the pressure.\n\n\"We have taken more actions recently against Hezbollah than in the history of our counterterrorism program,\" Sigal P. Mandelker, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the U.S. Treasury, said in the United Arab Emirates last month.\n\nMandelker said Washington is confident the Lebanese government and the central bank will \u201cdo the right thing here in making sure that Hezbollah can no longer have access to funds at the bank.\u201d\n\nHezbollah, whose Arabic name translates into \"Party of God,\" was established by Iran's Revolutionary Guard after Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982. The group, which enjoys wide support among Lebanon's Shiite community, runs institutions such as hospitals, clinics and schools _ but it also has tens of thousands of missiles that Hezbollah\u2019s leadership boasts can hit anywhere in Israel.\n\nThe group is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, some Gulf Arab countries and few Latin American nations, while the European Union considers only Hezbollah\u2019s military wing of the group to be a terrorist group.\n\nToday, it is among the most effective armed groups in the Middle East with an arsenal more powerful than that of the Lebanese army, and has sent thousands of its fighters to Syria to back President Bashar Assad's forces in that country\u2019s civil war. Hezbollah and its allies have more power than ever in parliament and government and President Michel Aoun is a strong ally of the group.\n\nHezbollah has acknowledged the sanctions are affecting them, but it says it has been able to cope with sanctions imposed by the U.S. for years. The group, however, warned that it is the job of the Lebanese state to defend its citizens when they come under sanctions simply because they belong to the group, are Shiite Muslims, or are Hezbollah sympathizers.\n\nIn July, the Treasury Department targeted two Hezbollah legislators, Amin Sherri and Mohammad Raad, in the first such move against lawmakers currently seated in Lebanon's parliament. A month later, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned Jammal Trust Bank for what it called \u201cknowingly facilitating banking activities.\u201d The bank, which denied the charges, was forced to close afterward.\n\nNeither Sherri nor Raad responded to requests for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nSo far, all the figures who have come under sanctions have been either Hezbollah officials or Shiite Muslim individuals who Washington says are aiding the group.\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the group will \u201cstudy well our alternatives\u201d now that the U.S. is targeting banks that Hezbollah does not own or deal with, as well as rich individuals and merchants simply because of their religious affiliation.\n\n\u201cWe said it in the past that when we are subjected to injustice we can be patient, but when our people are subjected to injustice we should behave in a different way,\u201d he said.\n\nNasrallah said the state and the government should defend Lebanese citizens. In an apparent reference to the Lebanese central bank that implements U.S. sanctions, Nasrallah said: \u201cSome state institutions should not rush to implement the American desires and orders this way.\u201d\n\nWalid Marrouch, an associate professor of economics at the Lebanese American University, says Lebanon\u2019s economy is 70% dollarized and since Lebanon is using this currency, Beirut has to abide by (U.S.) laws.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already living in a crisis and it will only make it worse,\u201d he said of sanctions and if Lebanon decides to stop abiding by U.S. Treasury Department orders.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The conflict between Iran and the U.S. that has created tensions throughout much of the Middle East is now also being felt in Lebanon, where Washington has slapped sanctions on the Iran-backed Hezbollah and warned they could soon expand to its allies, further deepening the tiny Arab country\u2019s economic", "authors": ["Bassem Mroue"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6FpURPeSmWyy5oRAmu0VOQ--~B/aD0yMjU1O3c9MjM1NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/cdd675ca1821305475b9eff58d2748b3", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
