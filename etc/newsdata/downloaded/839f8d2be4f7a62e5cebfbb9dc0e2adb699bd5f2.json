The Orioles won two of three at Toronto from April 1-3, then again from July 5-7, two of their four road series wins this season.\n\nTellez, who hit his 20th and 21st homers, is the fourth rookie in Blue Jays history to hit 20 or more home runs. The others were Eric Hinske (24 in 2002), J.P. Arencibia (23 in 2011) and Fred McGriff (20 in 1987).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty special, one of those things people dream of and work hard to do,\u201d Tellez said of reaching 20.\n\nTellez hit a leadoff drive against right-hander Gabriel Ynoa (1-10) in the fourth, then followed up with an opposite-field shot off left-hander Paul Fry to begin the sixth.\n\nIt was Tellez\u2019s third career multihomer game, and the 11th this season by a Blue Jays rookie, extending Toronto\u2019s major league record.\n\nMcKinney got Toronto started with the first leadoff home run of his career, lining Ynoa\u2019s second pitch of the game over the wall in right. The homer was McKinney\u2019s 12th.\n\nYnoa is winless since a July 17 victory over Washington. He allowed two runs and four hits in four innings.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t feeling great going into the game,\u201d Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. \u201cI thought he did a great job only allowing a couple of solo homers. He kept it right there for us.\u201d\n\nSpeaking through a translator, Ynoa downplayed his soreness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s normal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of those days where maybe you don\u2019t feel 100 percent.\u201d\n\nBaltimore\u2019s 18-game streak with at least one home run came to an end. The Orioles fell two games shy of matching the 1998 club record.\n\nWaguespack (5-5) allowed four hits, all singles, to win for the first time since Aug. 16 against Seattle, snapping a streak of four losing decisions.\n\n\u201cIt was a gutsy performance because he didn\u2019t have good stuff,\u201d Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s Trey Mancini went 0 for 3 with a walk, halting his 11-game hitting streak. Mancini said Waguespack relied on surprise, and superior location, to keep the Orioles off the scoreboard.\n\n\u201cHe did a really good job of locating and mixing his pitches,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cYou never really knew what he was going to throw. He wasn\u2019t afraid to throw anything in any count.\u201d\n\nJason Adam worked the seventh before the Orioles broke through against rookie Jordan Romano in the eighth, scoring their first run on Rio Ruiz\u2019s RBI groundout. Wilmer Font came on with the bases loaded and walked DJ Stewart on four pitches to make it a one-run game, then got Chris Davis to fly out to end the threat.\n\n\u201cWe had our chances late in the game and just didn\u2019t quite get the big hit,\u201d Hyde said.\n\nBaltimore produced 21 total runs Monday and Tuesday, scoring 10 or more in back-to-back games for the second time this season, but couldn\u2019t keep it going in the finale.\n\nToronto closer Ken Giles struck out the side in the ninth to earn his 22nd save in 23 opportunities.\n\nADDING ARMS\n\nAfter Toronto relievers combined to work 20 innings over the previous two games, the Blue Jays recalled RHP Yennsy Diaz from Double-A New Hampshire and selected RHP Ryan Dull. To make room on the 40-man roster, OF Lourdes Gurriel Jr. (appendectomy) was moved to the 60-day injured list. Blue Jays relievers tossed 11 innings in a 15-inning win Monday, then worked all nine innings Tuesday after LHP Anthony Kay (back) was scratched.\n\nTWO FOR TELLEZ\n\nTellez also hit two homers May 21 against Boston and June 19 against the Angels. All three of his multihomer games came at home.\n\nHIT PARADE\n\nThe Blue Jays won with fewer hits than their opponent for the 10th time this season.\n\nCLOSE ENCOUNTERS\n\nToronto is 18-23 in one-run games while Baltimore dropped to 11-21.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nBlue Jays: SS Bo Bichette (concussion) missed his sixth straight game. Bichette left last Thursday\u2019s game at Baltimore after being hit on the helmet by a pitch. He played catch and hit off a tee Wednesday, his first action since being hit. If Bichette plays again this season, it\u2019s expected to be as the DH in Sunday\u2019s season finale against Tampa Bay.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOrioles: Baltimore is off Thursday. RHP Asher Wojciechowski (3-8, 5.31) starts Friday as the final series of the season begins in Boston. Wojciechowski is 1-1 with a 5.89 in four September starts after going 0-4 with a 6.75 ERA in August. The Red Sox have not named a starter.\n\nBlue Jays: Toronto is off Thursday before hosting the Tampa Bay Rays in a season-ending series that begins Friday. RHP T.J. Zeuch (1-1, 4.58) starts for the Blue Jays. The rookie has allowed three runs or fewer in each of his four outings. The Rays have not named a starter.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Toronto rookies have made a habit of hitting home runs in bunches this season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ian Harrison"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/orioles_blue_jays_baseball_64738_c0-673-2400-2072_s1770x1032.jpg?2292dd409cedd65a004c06885850fd35389c0341", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
