Season the pork belly with salt, pepper, and ancho chile powder.\n\nScatter chiles in a large roasting pan and place the pork belly on top of the chiles, skin side down. Drizzle 1/2 cup of agave on top of the pork belly.\n\nDilute the remaining agave by whisking into chicken stock or water.\n\nAdd agave liquid to the roasting pan. Cover tightly with lid or aluminum foil and roast for 2 hours, basting pork with pan juices every 30 minutes.\n\nTurn pork belly over and continue roasting until it is fork tender, about 2 more hours.\n\nTransfer pork to a deep tray or plate, reserving the pan juices, and set it aside to cool. Once pork has cooled, cover it with parchment or waxed paper. Place a large plate over the covered pork belly and weigh it down with heavy cans or a foil-wrapped brick. Refrigerate pork this way overnight.\n\nStrain the liquid from the roasting pan into a saucepan, reserving the chiles.\n\nSimmer the sauce for about 30 to 45 minutes until it is reduced to about 1 cup. Add reserved chiles and remove thickened sauce from the heat. Set aside to let the glaze cool, then place in the refrigerator to chill.\n\nWhen you are ready to serve the dish, remove pork belly from refrigerator. Preheat a large, heavy skillet or cast-iron pan over medium heat.\n\nSlice pork belly into 1-inch wedges.\n\nSear each side of the pork belly until it\u2019s crispy and heated through, about 3 minutes each side. Reheat the glaze and brush it on the pork.\n\nInstructions to make crispy chicken skin:\n\nPreheat oven 320 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nSpray with oil the chicken skin and season with salt.\n\nSpray one of the sheet pans with oil and extend the chicken skin so is completely flat.\n\nSpray the bottom of the other tray and bake for 30 minutes or until crisp.\n\nRemove from the oven and slightly brush the agave/miso and sprinkle the Chile piquin on top to taste.\n\nBreak in desired shape pieces.\n\nInstructions to make spicy pico:\n\nIn a nonreactive bowl, toss together tomatoes, cucumber, onion, jalape\u00f1o, and cilantro with lemon juice and vegetable oil.\n\nSeason with salt and pepper.\n\nLet pico sit at room temperature for 15\u201320 minutes before serving.\n\nInstructions to make dressing:\n\nIn a small bowl, combine lemon juice, honey, salt, and pepper.\n\nWhisk together, slowly pouring in the olive oil to emulsify dressing.\n\nInstructions to make jicama slaw:\n\nIn a medium-size bowl, combine all ingredients.\n\nPour dressing over jicama and toss well.\n\nMarcela\u2019s enfrijoladas -- chicken soft tacos in black bean sauce\n\nMarcela Valladolid\n\nChef Marcela grew up on the Mexican side of the border these recipes remind her of her Tijuana upbringing, including being surrounded by cooks from all over Mexico cook in her home kitchen. She has tasted versions of this dish from all over Mexico and said the dish can change regionally from both preparations to ingredients included, but is always delicious.\n\nTo make this kid-friendly meal even easier, Marcela recommends using a pre-purchased rotisserie chicken and ready-made pico de gallo to sprinkle over the enfrijoladas.\n\nIngredients for 6 enfrijoladas:\n\n1 15-ounce can organic black beans\n\n1/3 cup low-sodium chicken broth (additional as needed)\n\n1 large garlic clove, peeled, sliced\n\n1 canned chipotle in adobo (you can use half or none if no spice is desired)\n\n3/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n\n1/4 teaspoon crumbled oregano\n\n1/4 teaspoon cumin\n\n1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons avocado oil\n\n6 organic corn tortillas\n\n1 and 1/2 cups shredded chicken\n\nGarnishes including crumbled queso fresco, chopped tomatoes, sliced red onions, cilantro leaves and shredded iceberg lettuce\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n\n\nAdd undrained beans, chicken broth, garlic, salt, oregano and cumin to blender and blend at high speed until very smooth.\n\nHeat 2 tablespoons of the avocado oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat.\n\nAdd bean sauce and cook, stirring frequently so beans won\u2019t stick to side of pan, until slightly thickened but still runny, about 8 minutes.\n\nIn a small skillet heat 1/3 cup oil until hot but not smoking (dip a wooden spoon inside oil and if it bubbles it means it\u2019s ready).\n\nDip one tortilla into oil and fry on both sides until golden but still pliable, about 30 seconds per side.\n\nUsing tongs, lift to allow excess oil to drop and then dip into bean sauce.\n\nTransfer tortilla covered in sauce to cutting board (board will get messy!).\n\nCover half with a scant 1/4 cup chicken and fold other tortilla half over.\n\nTransfer to platter.\n\nRepeat with remaining 5 tortillas, bean sauce and chicken. Top with desired garnishes.\n\nChef Jordan\u2019s hard tacos stuffed with sauteed bok choy and topped with chicken adobo\n\nChef Jordan enjoys making tacos for his friends and brings a press to their homes to make fresh-pressed masa corn tortillas.\n\nWhen building a hard shell taco, Jordan recommends placing dry ingredients on the bottom and wet ingredients on top.
