She wore the frock over a pair of matching trousers, just like Princess Diana did in the \u201990s.\n\nView photos\n\nSimilar to Middleton, Princess Di wore a baby-blue gown over a pair of pants.\n\nMiddleton\u2019s royal tour of Pakistan will take place from October 14 to October 18. The trip was requested by Britain\u2019s Foreign and Commonwealth Office and will follow in the footsteps of previous Pakistan tours carried out by Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles in 2006, Princess Diana in 1996 (duh) and Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip in both 1961 and 1997.\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure: Blue is definitely Middleton\u2019s color.\n\nRELATED: Listen to \u2018Royally Obsessed,\u2019 the Podcast for People Who Love the Royal Family", "description": "This brand-new photo proves that Kate Middleton\u2019s wardrobe during the royal tour of Pakistan won\u2019t disappoint.Earlier today, the...", "authors": ["Editor Purewow.Com", "Purewow"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8rdz01UPgMkp5fiGZ.Hj6w--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xMTkwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/purewow_185/c7ee01c1226a0cb32c582ce55bd4a08c", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
