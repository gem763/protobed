You can do it!!!'\n\nArgentina legend Diego Maradona could have his own starting 11 of children\n\nA 23-year-old brunette called Magali has emerged as the latest possible member\n\nShe reportedly launched legal proceedings in April to try to prove her blood link\n\nOn Tuesday a 23-year-old brunette called Magali emerged as the latest possible member of Maradona's ever-growing brood.\n\nPopular Argentinian TV programme Intrusos said she had a young daughter which would make the former Napoli and Barcelona star a grandfather if he is confirmed as her dad.\n\nShe reportedly launched legal proceedings in April to try to prove her blood link.\n\nJournalist Adrian Pallares told Intrusos: 'Her mother didn't raise her but her adoptive family, who gave her all their love.\n\n'The time came when she discovered she didn't belong to that family and that her father could be Diego Armando Maradona.'\n\nLast month Santiago Lara, who comes from the same Argentinian city of La Plata where Maradona now manages top-flight side Gimnasia y Esgrima, made a renewed TV appeal for the Argentine legend to recognise him as his son.\n\nThe teenager, whose waitress mum Natalia Garat died aged 23 from lung cancer in 2006 and was raised by her ex-boyfriend Marcelo Lara, spoke for the first time in 2016 of his fight to find out who his real dad is.\n\nOver recent years Maradona has recognised his grown-up son Diego Junior, 33\n\nGiannina was married to Sergio Aguero and is a daughter of ex-wife Claudia Villafane\n\nHe said at the time: 'I've been told my real father is supposedly Diego Maradona. My dad is always going to be Marcelo Lara but what I've been told is that my real father is supposedly Diego Maradona.\n\nMARADONA'S KIDS Diego Junior - 33 Dalma - 32 Giannina - 30 Jana - 22 Diego Fernando - 6\n\n'I think I look like him, the face, the curls, everything. I look at Marcelo and I know we're not alike. It's not easy to wake up in the morning with that feeling.'\n\n'I found out after I went past a newspaper stand near my house aged 13 and saw a magazine front cover with Maradona's face on it and mine pixellated underneath.\n\n'I was left in a state of shock because I didn't know what I was doing in the magazine.\n\n'I went running home and asked Marcelo what was going on and he explained everything.\n\n'He told me my mum was well-known on the modelling circuit when she was younger and he told me he had the feeling I wasn't his son.\n\n'He told me a DNA test was asked for but was never forthcoming.'\n\nMaradona's lawyer Matias Morla has already said the retired footballer will assume his responsibilities as Santiago's father if the blood link is confirmed.\n\nDalma Maradona (Right) at a Boca Juniors match in 2018 with Benjamin Aguero\n\nMaradona pictured alongside his third recognised daughter Jana at a Boca match in 2015\n\nMorla has previously been quoted as saying 'Everyone knows that in Argentina there's Santiago and another person that people are talking about', although other media in the South American country have speculated the 11th child that would make up Diego's football team is a fourth Cuban.\n\nThe Cuban trio whose names have already been made public are Joana, Lu and Javielito, born after Maradona moved to the Caribbean island in February 2000 to fight drink and drug addictions.\n\nMr Morla, who admitted last October the ex-footballer had been 'naughty' in Cuba and confessed: 'There's going to be a lot of Maradonas, a lot, even if some people don't like it', has confirmed the trio met him during the funeral of Fidel Castro.\n\nOver recent years Maradona has recognised his grown-up son Diego Junior, born from an extra-marital affair with Italian model Cristina Sinagra, and 22-year-old Jana who met her dad for the first time nearly six years ago following a court fight by her mum Valeria Sabalain.\n\nMaradona has a six-year-old son called Diego Fernando by former girlfriend Veronia Ojeda\n\nMaradona also has two daughters by his ex-wife, 32-year-old Dalma and 30-year-old Gianinna, and a six-year-old son called Diego Fernando by former girlfriend Veronica Ojeda.\n\nSeveral Spanish-language memes went viral after Maradona's lawyer revealed the three Cuban children.\n\nOne said: 'If you were born between 1980 and 2019 and you have extraordinary footballing skills, contact us. You could be a son of Diego Maradona.'\n\nAnother, showing hundreds of people queuing outside an unidentified building, has a message alongside it which says: 'The day of the declaration of Maradona's heirs.'", "description": "GERARD COUZENS: Diego Maradona could have his own starting 11 of children after a 23-year-old Argentinian was named as the latest woman fighting to prove she is his daughter.", "authors": ["Gerard Couzens For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/10/19731580-0-image-a-15_1571130326167.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
