We had great belief in this team. All the credit needs to go to the openers and debutant Banuka (Rajapaksa). The bowlers also started well.\"\n\nPradeep had world number one Twenty20 batsman Babar Azam in the second over to set the platform for their biggest win against Pakistan in 19 bilateral matches.\n\nThe previous biggest T20 win by Sri Lanka over Pakistan was by 37 runs at Hambantota in 2012.\n\nPakistan needed a big innings from Azam who promised much with two boundaries but was caught behind off Pradeep.\n\nComeback stars Umar Akmal fell for a first ball duck while Ahmed Shehzad managed just four before skipper Sarfaraz Ahmed (24 off 30 balls) and Iftikhar Ahmed (25 off 24) added 46 runs for the fourth wicket.\n\nHowever, they batted slowly and the asking rate soared.\n\nUdana then chipped in with three wickets and spinner Wanindu Hasaranga two to stun a miserable Pakistan.\n\n\"Sri Lanka played better than us and that's why we were wary of them,\" admitted Sarfaraz. \"We lost Babar early and that put pressure on the batting.\"\n\nThe win is significant for an inexperienced Sri Lanka team -- ranked eighth in Twenty20s -- who are missing ten top players, including regular skipper Lasith Malinga, who all refused to tour over security fears.\n\nEarlier, Gunathilaka scored a 38-ball 57 with eight boundaries and a six during a quick 84-run opening stand with Avishka Fernando who made a 34-ball 33 with three boundaries after Pakistan sent them into bat.\n\nRajapaksa hit a solid 22-ball 32 with two sixes and as many boundaries while Shanaka chipped in with a fiery 10-ball 17 with two sixes.\n\nSri Lanka were looking set for a big total but paceman Hasnain derailed them with wickets of Rajapaksa off the last ball of the 16th over before dismissing Shanaka and Shehan Jayasuriya off the first two balls of the 18th over to complete a hat-trick.\n\nHasnain's hat-trick is the ninth in all Twenty20 internationals with Malinga registering the feat twice.\n\nHasnain is the second Pakistani after Faheem Ashraf to achieve a hat-trick.\n\nAshraf achieved the feat against Sri Lanka two years ago.\n\nThe remaining two matches will be played on Monday and Wednesday -- also in Lahore.", "description": "Inexperienced Sri Lanka stunned Pakistan by 64 runs in the first Twenty20 international in Lahore on Saturday, taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9440/20d202ae7ed74e54aded8497980c5f6a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
