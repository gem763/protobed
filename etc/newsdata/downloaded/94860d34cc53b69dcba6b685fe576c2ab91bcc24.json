The crime was a flagrant violation of the kingdom\u2019s laws and an egregious affront to our values.\n\nIn response, the kingdom\u2019s leadership has publicly taken responsibility for what occurred because it happened under its watch and has implemented concrete measures to ensure that nothing like this happens again.\n\nSince then, several senior officials have been dismissed from their positions, and 20 people have been investigated. The Saudi public prosecutor has indicted 11 people, all of whom are on trial. He has also asked for the death penalty for five of them.\n\nOther important steps included the restructuring of government agencies.\n\nAll of these measures have been enacted because one life was unjustly taken. The kingdom has dealt with this terrible incident the way any responsible member of the international community would.\n\nSaudi Arabia has been a bastion of stability in a region long defined by its instability. While we mediate the peaceful resolution of conflicts and combat terrorism and extremism, our foes do the exact opposite. Whether it is the Iranian regime \u2014 the premier state sponsor of terrorism in the world \u2014 or one of its proxy forces like the Houthi militia in Yemen, these forces of destruction have shown callous disregard for the well-being and the lives of their own countrymen as well as citizens of other nations.\n\nOUR VIEW: Saudi money is talking louder than murder\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman shake hands in Osaka, Japan, on June 28, 2019.

We ask that you judge us on our achievements, not our shortcomings.\n\nFahad Nazer is the spokesperson for the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/10/14/saudi-arabia-undergoing-unprecedented-transformation-jamal-khashoggi-aberration-editorials-debates/3979362002/", "description": "Jamal Khashoggi's death was an aberration that should not define us as a nation, writes Fahad Nazer,  spokesperson for the Saudi Embassy.", "authors": ["Fahad Nazer", "Opinion Contributor", "Published P.M.
