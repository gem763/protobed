Often resistant to medical treatments, it is in contrast to acute pain, which arises suddenly in response to a specific injury and which is usually treatable.\n\nChronic pain is a frequent condition, affecting an estimated 20 percent of people in Europe, but relatively little research has been conducted to identify critical areas of need in the policy environment or indeed, what actions are required to support treatment and care for patients.\n\nNew data on the policy environment affecting chronic pain patients in Europe suggests a pervasive lack of political and public awareness and prioritization regarding chronic pain.\n\nPresented at the 2019 Congress of the European Pain Federation (EFIC) in Valencia (September 4-7, 2019), the new study, Prioritizing Pain: An analysis of the policy environment affecting patients suffering from chronic pain across Europe, was sponsored by Pfizer/Lilly and conducted by Charles River Associates. It reveals a disparity in pain-related policies and initiatives across Europe.\n\nComprising a systematic literature review across seven European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland, Sweden and the U.K.), the study compares national government policies and non-governmental initiatives in chronic pain across four policy areas: awareness and recognition; coordination and diagnosis; access to treatment; and ongoing support.\n\nThe study has discovered that while targeted policies and programs do exist, chronic pain is not prioritized through coordinated national plans. It also found that while patient advocacy groups are key drivers for awareness-related policy change and implementation, such groups often receive limited government support.\n\nIt reveals a disparity in pain-related policies and initiatives across Europe.\n\nFurthermore, it was shown in the study that although clinical guidelines on diagnosis, treatment and management have been established, their application is often limited, and many countries report delays in diagnosis and suboptimal pain management.\n\nAccording to the findings, there are no provisions in value-assessment and reimbursement processes applied to specialized pain treatments, and dedicated centers supporting patients\u2019 long-term care vary across regions and countries.\n\nThe study recommends the sharing of best practices and, given the challenges facing patients, that governments should develop clear policy agendas to address the lack of awareness among patients, health care professionals and payers regarding chronic pain prevention, diagnosis, treatments, self-management guidelines and support networks.\n\nAdditionally, the study stresses the importance of the role of patients in the assessment of treatments and highlights the need for appropriate provisions to be put in place in value-assessment methodology to ensure appropriate access to treatment and care.\n\nWith chronic pain\u2019s low ranking in the political consciousness now an emerging issue at national and pan-European level, efforts to ensure appropriate access to treatment and care, as well as patient involvement in health technology assessment will need to be , according to the study.\n\nPatient groups and medical societies working on pain have been active in elevating pain on the policy agenda in Europe. However, as this study has found, a lot remains to be done to ensure further investigation and discussion in the area of pain policy.\n\nThis latest study on pain highlights the need for further investigation and discussion in the area of pain policy. Figuratively and literally, pain remains something upon which is it often hard to put one\u2019s finger. With our research on the topic, we are striving to address this on both fronts.\n\nThe recent nomination of Stella Kyriakides \u2014 herself a chronic disease patient and advocate \u2014 as EU Health Commissioner, coupled with an expanded portfolio remit that now oversees the regulation of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, has shone a spotlight on Europe\u2019s current and forthcoming health agenda. Those individuals and organizations with a personal or professional interest in pain will be looking on with keen interest to see how developments in this arena unfold.\n\nAuthors:", "description": "One in five Europeans affected, yet research reveals chronic pain ranks low in political consciousness", "authors": ["Professor Thomas R T\u00f6lle", "Department Of Neurology", "Technische Universit\u00e4t", "Professor Serge Perrot", "Centre De La Douleur", "H\u00f4pital Cochin", "Facult\u00e9 Paris Descartes"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/iStock-482507561-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
