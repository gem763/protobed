Clearly, his feelings have not changed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful with this guy,\u201d De Niro continued. \u201cHe has no center, no ethics, no morals. He\u2019s amoral, immoral.\u201d\n\nThe actor wasn\u2019t the only person ready to see the impeachment inquiry underway, director Spike Lee is also rooting for the ousting of \u201cAgent Orange.\u201d When the Oscar-winner was asked on who he liked for the 2020 presidential election, all Lee would say was \u201cAgent Orange, gotta go,\u201d referring to President Trump.\n\n\u201cThe Irishman\u201d is a Netflix film directed by Martin Scorsese starring De Niro, Al Pacino, Anna Paquin and Joe Pesci. Based off the Charles Brandt memoir \u201cI Heard You Paint Houses,\u201d the crime drama explores a mob hitman\u2019s involvement with the slaying of Jimmy Hoffa. De Niro plays a World War II veteran named Frank Sheeran who returns home to drive trucks in the 1950\u2019s only to find himself caught up in scandal.\n\nBut the scandal on everyone\u2019s mind at the premiere wasn\u2019t the storied Hoffa controversy, but rather the action taken by the house Democrats.\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
