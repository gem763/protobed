Trump Is Doing the Opposite.", "language": "en", "text": "Now contrast Trump\u2019s approach.\n\n1. Talk more about impeachment. In these precious first defining days, Trump has been raving nonstop against the whistle-blower, the House, and all his political foes\u2014seen and unseen. His Twitter account is wholly obsessed with impeachment. He makes no pretense of focusing on the job that the American people elected him to do. It\u2019s Nancy Pelosi who has delegated impeachment to a committee of the House while she focuses on running her chamber. He\u2019s made it clear that so long as impeachment is even being discussed\u2014there have been no votes yet\u2014he cannot and will not focus on any other aspect of his job.\n\n2. Show no contrition. Trump\u2019s message is aggrieved victimhood. He did not try to extort the Ukrainian president into helping him politically, he insists. He likened the whistle-blower\u2019s sources to spies. But these two defenses contradict each other. If the allegations are untrue, then he was not spied upon; if he was spied upon, the allegations are not untrue. But he does not worry about logic or consistency. His message is emotional\u2014poor, poor me\u2014and is aimed only at those willing to join his pity party.\n\n3. Leave fingerprints everywhere. Trump has called for a treason trial of the House committee investigating him\u2014and for the most heinous punishment of those who brought to light his conversations with Ukraine\u2019s president. The whistle-blower has reportedly sought protection. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s personal emissary, Rudy Giuliani, has appeared on television to implicate Trump\u2019s secretary of state in every improper action of this administration.\n\n4. Make no attempt at persuasion. Suppose you do not like Trump much, but do appreciate the prosperity of the past few years. This White House has nothing to say to you. Unless you are up-to-speed on conspiracy theories from Infowars or QAnon, you cannot even comprehend the president\u2019s defense\u2014much less believe it. Trump is running an impeachment defense for the 35 percent of the country that likes him a lot, and is gambling that 35 percent will suffice.\n\n5. Read the stage directions aloud. On September 28, Rudy Giuliani tweeted a warning that impeachment of Trump would jeopardize \u201cdomestic tranquility.\u201d The next day, President Trump warned that impeachment would \u201cdestabilize\u201d the United States. Team Trump is ramping up threats of disorder and potential violence\u2014even a \u201cCivil War like fracture\u201d\u2014if the president is held to account, and sending those threats from its own return address. The intended message is: Removing these people might be dangerous. But what Team Trump is really communicating is: Leaving them where they are is definitely more dangerous.\n\nThrough most of 1998, Bill Clinton\u2019s approval rating exceeded 60 percent. On the day the House voted for impeachment, it jumped to 73 percent. Americans signaled that they opposed removing Clinton, and it didn\u2019t happen. Trump\u2019s approval has never reached 50 percent in any non-Rasmussen poll. Already a plurality favors impeachment. Trump supporters have taken to tweeting images of the large empty spaces of the United States to send the message that the tumble weeds and prairie dogs will be severely displeased if Trump is impeached.", "description": "During the Lewinsky scandal, Clinton focused on doing his job.
