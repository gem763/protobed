The ID.3 is a Golf-size hatchback that will cost from 'under \u20ac30,000'\n\nVolkswagen showcased the ID.3 for the first time at a preview event for the Frankfurt Motor Show on Monday evening.\n\nIt kickstarts the car maker's new range of electric vehicles, which are the first to be designed from the ground up specifically for electric powertrains instead of internal combustion engines.\n\nIt also marks a pivotal initial step in repairing VW's clouded reputation following the emission cheating scandal in 2015.\n\nThe ID.3 '1st' special edition, pictured here, will be available in Europe from the middle of next year and will be sandwiched by two other variants at a later date.\n\nThis launch version uses a 58kWh battery, which has an official range (by current WLTP standards) of 420 kilometres (261 miles) and a top speed of 99mph.\n\nPower is sent to a 150kW electric motor via a single-speed transmission on the rear axle.\n\nThe ID.3 will be available to buy from mid-2020. This '1st' edition will be available from launch\n\nThe launch model will initially only be available with the mid-tier battery option. This is a 58kWh battery, which has an official range (by current WLTP standards) of 420 kilometres (261 miles) and a top speed of 99mph\n\nPower is sent to a 150kW electric motor via a single-speed transmission on the rear axle\n\nThe high-voltage battery is arranged in the chassis floor to keep the centre of gravity low and free-up class-leading amounts of cabin space.\n\nThe remaining auxiliary power supplies for things such as the air conditioning and assisted steering are all housed in the front end, where you'd traditionally find an engine.\n\nThis means there's plenty of room in the back for a practical-size boot. In fact, the 385 litres of luggage space behind the rear seats is - impressively - five litres more than you get in today's Golf hatchback.\n\nEqually admirable is the car's long-distance capabilities.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a The high-voltage battery is arranged in the chassis floor to keep the centre of gravity low and free-up class-leading amounts of cabin space\n\nVolkswagen reckons this mid-level version will be the most popular of the three variants to go on sale, with a smaller 45kWh and rangier 77kWh model following\n\nThese will have maximum ranges of 330km (205 miles) and 550km (342 miles) respectively, which almost aligns the ID.3 with Tesla's existing three-tier Model 3 line up\n\nThe VW ID.3 1st will be a lot cheaper than the most affordable Model 3 on sale in the UK. The Standard Range Model 3 is priced from \u00a336,490 and can only cover up to 254 miles between charges - 7 miles less than the Volkswagen\n\nWhen plugged into a 100kWh fast charger for just half an hour, the 58kWh battery can be replenished to around 70 per cent capacity providing around 290km (180 miles) of range in the time it takes to stretch your legs and drink, and then dispose of, a coffee.\n\nVolkswagen reckons this mid-level version will be the most popular of the three variants to go on sale, with a smaller 45kWh and rangier 77kWh model following.\n\nVolkswagen ID.3: Will it fit in my garage? Model: Volkswagen ID.3 1st Price: from under \u00a330,000 Available from: Middle of 2020 Battery: 58kWh Motor: 150kW electric motor Gearbox: 1-speed Maximum range: 261 miles Top speed: 99mph Length: 4,261mm Width: 1,809mm Height: 1,552mm Wheelbase: 2,675mm Boot capacity: 385 litres\n\nThese will have maximum ranges of 330km (205 miles) and 550km (342 miles) respectively, which almost aligns the ID.3 with Tesla's existing three-tier Model 3 line up.\n\nFor instance, the most affordable Model 3 on sale in the UK is the \u00a336,490 Standard Range Plus, which can cover up to 254 miles between charges.\n\nThe middle-of-the-road spec is the Long Range, which has a starting price of \u00a344,490 and the longest range of the trio offering 348 miles of driving before you need to plug it in again.\n\nThe priciest is the \u00a349,140 Performance, which has a range of just 329 miles but is the fastest of the bunch.\n\nThat means the Volkswagen is comparably quite a lot cheaper to buy.\n\nBosses say the basic ID.3, which is almost identical in size to the current Golf, will be 'under \u20ac30,000 in Germany'.\n\nThis makes the price 'comparable to that of typical compact vehicles', following the deduction of government grants for electric cars, such as the Plug-in Car Grant in the UK.\n\n'Its clear objective is to help electric mobility break through on the mass market,' with the brand offering extended cover on the vehicle and discounted charging options.\n\nThe car will be sold with a battery warranty that covers the unit for eight years or 160,000km (99,420 miles) as peace of mind for buyers.\n\nCustomers will also be rewarded with a complimentary WeCharge scheme for the first year of ownership.\n\nThis offers free charging for the 12 months or up to 2,000kWh (which ever of the two comes first) using Ionity's network of 100,000 charging points across Europe.\n\nVolkswagen, which owns a stake in Ionity, says it will bolster this network by installing another 400 ultra-fast charging stations along main European routes by next year - all of which will use renewable energy sources.\n\nThe car maker will also have its own branded home wallbox chargers at an additional cost, with two versions available for order that will be 'made available at prices significantly under those common on the market today', it says.\n\nCustomers will also be rewarded with a complimentary WeCharge scheme for the first year of ownership offering free charging using Ionity's network of 100,000 charging points across Europe\n\nThe car will be sold with a battery warranty that covers the unit for eight years or 160,000km (99,420 miles) as peace of mind for buyers\n\nWithout the need for cooling ports to modulate an engine's temperature, the front-end design can focus on sleek, aerodynamic, lines and the inclusion of new technology\n\nVolkswagen ID.3: Design\n\nWhile the ID.3 shares similar dimensions to the Golf the styling is undeniably more futuristic.\n\nWithout the need for cooling ports to modulate an engine's temperature, the front-end design can focus on sleek, aerodynamic shapes and lines as well as the inclusion of groundbreaking new technology.\n\nFor instance, the model is fitted with interactive matrix LED headlights that can stay on full beam at speeds over 60kmh (37mph) without dazzling oncoming vehicles.\n\nVolkswagen says the lights also 'flutter the eyelids' at an owner when they approach, which takes the human relationship with cars to a whole new level (though feels a little odd, to us).\n\nRound the back the standout feature - apart from the obvious lack of exhaust tips - is the glass-panel boot door, which is finished in contrast black, similar to VW's Up city car.\n\nThe wheels, available in sizes from 18 to 20 inches, are dish-like alloys shaped in a way that they efficiently transfer airflow away from the vehicle and - thanks to the arrangement of the drivetrain in the floor - sit close to the four corners of the chassis.\n\nThat allows for more cabin space than you'd tend to find in a conventional car of this size.\n\nThe dashboard has been cleared of buttons and replaced by a 10-inch touch screen display for all the major controls\n\nStop and go: Volkswagen's even mounted 'pause' and 'play' icons on the brake and accelerator pedal respectively\n\nThe instrument cluster is a high definition screen, and there's the option of an augmented reality head-up display that projects all the relevant driving information onto the windscreen\n\nVolkswagen ID.3: Interior\n\nThe ID.3 measures in at 4,261mm long, which is just 3mm longer than today's Golf. However, the wheelbase (distance from the front wheel to the rear) is 145mm bigger than that of the conventional hatchback.\n\nWith no transmission tunnel, the floor is entirely flat and therefore should provide loads of leg room, especially for those seated in the rear bench.\n\nAs for the interior design, the dashboard has been cleared of buttons and replaced by a 10-inch touch screen display for all the major controls.\n\nThere are touch-sensitive function buttons on the steering wheel, but the only tactile switches that remain in the car are those for the electric windows and one to engage the hazard warning light.\n\nThe instrument cluster is a high definition screen too, and there's the option of an augmented reality head-up display that projects all the relevant driving information onto the windscreen so it appears like it is 10 metres in the distance at all times.\n\n'With the ID.3, Volkswagen is heading towards the future,' explained Klaus Bischoff, the car's chief designer.\n\n'The natural style and absolutely intuitive driver experience demonstrate a new, electric way of thinking,' he added.\n\nLED light strips around the interior can change colour to alert the driver if they need to brake urgently when triggered by sensors around the car that feed information to a raft of safety kit believe a crash is imminent\n\nThe ID.3 will be produced at VW's Zwickau factory in in Saxony, which is externally provided with renewable energy that's generated by a hydroelectric power station - and has been since 2017\n\nVolkswagen wants the ID range to be carbon neutral. It even has a recycling concept for the batteries once they come to the end of their service life\n\nAs with most modern cars, the ID.3 also has voice control, which can be called into action by saying \"hello ID\". It even recognises which occupant has asked the question and lights up their section of the cabin when responding.\n\nThese interior LED light strips also change colour to alert the driver if they need to brake urgently when sensors around the car are triggered by the raft of safety kit. These features include front assist, city emergency braking, pedestrian monitoring, lane assist, side assist and park assist, in case you were wondering.\n\nThe ID.3 will be produced at VW's Zwickau factory in Saxony, Germany, which is externally provided with renewable energy that's generated by a hydroelectric power station - and has been since 2017.\n\nThis is part of the car maker's plan to make its electric vehicle range carbon neutral, which also includes an efficient recycling concept for the batteries once they come to the end of their service life.", "description": "The ID.3 is the first of 20 electric cars promised by VW in the next decade.
