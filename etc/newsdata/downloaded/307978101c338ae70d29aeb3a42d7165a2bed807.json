It also generated surplus energy that was distributed back into the Finnish national grid to heat homes in the Helsinki area.\n\nDe Vos endorsed the horse show organizer\u2019s ecological \u201cHelsinki Jumps Green\u201d project as \u201ca tremendous contribution\u201d to equestrian sport and said it helped not only the local community but was also taking forward the federation\u2019s push for more sustainable horse sports globally.\n\nAnssi Paalanen, the vice president of Fortum Horsepower, told The Associated Press the manure-gathering scheme took off as an internal startup project five years ago. It has since grown into a full-fledged business, with 70,000 tons of manure collected from horse stables in Finland since 2015.\n\nAn average horse produces eight to ten tons of manure per year, equaling up to 15 megawatt hours of energy, Paalanen said. Manure from only two horses is enough to heat a single-family house for one year, he added.\n\nWith some 75,000 horses in Finland, manure makes another renewable energy source in the Nordic country of 5.5 million. The center-left government has made tackling the effects of climate change a priority and aims to make Finland carbon neutral by 2035.\n\nFortum, a state-controlled company operating in several European countries, says manure output from the estimated 6 million horses in Europe could satisfy Finland\u2019s entire electricity consumption.\n\n\u201cHorse manure is relatively energy-rich, ash-free and dry in comparison, for example, to cow manure, which is notably damper material,\u201d Paalanen said. \u201cAs a chemical substance, it is surprisingly close to wood chips.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, horse manure has been used as a natural fertilizer on fields but lots of it has also ended up as general waste.\n\nPaalanen said manure dumping to landfills has been banned in the European Union for several years now and noted that the evolving manure-to-energy technology holds \u201cimmense potential for countries with large horse populations.\u201d\n\nIn southern Finland, Fortum transports manure by trucks directly from horse stables to the company\u2019s biofuel-fired, combined heat and power plant in Jarvenpaa, 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Helsinki. There the manure is mixed and burnt with forestry residues like sawdust and wood chips.\n\nPaalanen stressed that manure is never burnt on its own and, as a rule, makes up no more than 10% of the biomass.\n\nFEI, which says environmental sustainability is a priority, has published a sustainability guide book for horse event organizers. FEI says when horse manure replaces other biomass in power and heat production it is estimated to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 200 kilograms per ton of manure.\n\n\u201cAnd if horse manure replaces fossil fuels like coal, the benefits are even greater,\u201d FEI said.", "description": "HELSINKI (AP) \u2014 In a glimpse of the future, an entire sports event has been run on horse manure.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Jussi-Nukari_Lehtikuva-via-AP-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
