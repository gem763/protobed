He\u2019ll start at No. 6 for the first time since 2016, and will become the fourth Wallaby to start at No. 6, 7 and 8 during the World Cup.\n\nHooper will start on the openside and Salakaia-Loto is expected to come in off the bench. Two of the best openside flankers in the game, Pocock and Hooper have regularly combined in the backrow to give Australia speed to the breakdown.\n\nHead coach Michael Cheika picked Christian Leali\u2019ifano at flyhalf in favor of Bernard Foley, who was one of the stars of Australia\u2019s run to the final in 2015 but was left out of the squad to face Fiji.\n\n\u201cWe are hungry to play our best rugby,\u201d Cheika said. \u201cWe want to do two things - our best to win the tournament, and we want to show young people in Australia how beautiful the game can be.\u201d\n\nAllan Alaalatoa got a starting spot in the front row for Australia, adding to his family\u2019s rugby legacy. His father, Vili, played for Western Samoa in the 1991 World Cup. Reserve props James Slipper and Sekope Kepu have more than 200 test caps combined and are on a heavily experienced bench that also includes veteran scrumhalf Will Genia.\n\nThree of the Wallabies\u2019 starters - No. 8 Isi Naisarani, winger Marika Koroibete and inside center Samu Kerevi - were born in Fiji.\n\nThe Fiji starting lineup contains three players who won gold medals when rugby sevens made its Olympic debut at Rio de Janeiro in 2016, with lock Leone Nakarawa, backrower Viliame Mata and winger Josua Tuisova all in the 15.\n\nNakarawa, and Campese Ma\u2019afu are two of the four players in the Fiji starting lineup who are starting in their third World Cup.\n\nFormer rugby league star Semi Radradra earned a starting spot on the wing, with Australia-born Ben Volavola starting at flyhalf.\n\nFiji head coach John McKee said there\u2019s a strong sense of belief within his squad, which is aiming to upset either Australia or Six Nations champion Wales to earn a spot in the quarterfinals.\n\n\u201cWe have high ambitions in this World Cup. We know we have big challenges with big teams in our pool but it\u2019s a great first match for us,\u201d McKee said. \u201cA lot of test match rugby is run in the close quarters and it\u2019s going to be a big game for both teams at the gain line and in both attack and defense.\n\n\u201cFor us it\u2019ll be a game of limited opportunities and we have to make sure that we nail opportunities and turn them into points.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nAustralia: Kurtley Beale, Reece Hodge, James O\u2019Connor, Samu Kerevi, Marika Koroibete, Christian Leali\u2019ifano, Nic White; Isi Naisarani, Michael Hooper, David Pocock, Rory Arnold, Izack Rodda, Allan Allalatoa, Tolu Latu, Scott Sio.
