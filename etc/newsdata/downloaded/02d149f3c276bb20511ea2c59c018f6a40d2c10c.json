The new clinic, she added, is six times the size of the current clinic open in St. Louis.\n\nThe head of the National Abortion Federation (NAF) said that the clinic was prepared to take an influx of patients down the road if conservative states such as Texas move to further restrict abortion rights.\n\n\u201cWe are prepared to take an influx from places that could lose access altogether,\u201d Rev. Katherine Hancock Ragsdale told the Times.\n\nPlanned Parenthood first announced the construction of the clinic earlier this month, which was done through a shell company to avoid negative attention from anti-abortion groups.\n\n\"We were really intentional and thoughtful about making sure that we were able to complete this project as expeditiously as possible because we saw the writing on the wall \u2014 patients need better access, so we wanted to get it open as quickly as we could,\" said Colleen McNicholas, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri earlier this month.", "description": "A new Planned Parenthood clinic opening this week in Fairview Heights, Ill., could provide abortion services to around 11,000 women per year as abortion restrictions in some red states have been tightened in recent months.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/plannedparenthoodclinic_053019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
