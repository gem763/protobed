In the month of September, challans were being issued to all and sundry but only a handful of those can beat this - a challan for over speeding at a speed of 47 kmph.\n\nYou read that right, as this is exactly what a hardware engineer from Noida claims to have received. Mohit Sharma, as mentioned in a TOI report, was recently a victim of this absurd challan. Even more interestingly, it has to be duly noted that no roads in Noida have a speed limit of under 47 kmph.\n\nYet the challan issued to Sharma mentions that his vehicle was caught speeding on a road with a speed limit of 40 kmph. As per Sharma, the challan was issued to him at 12:49 pm on August 16. His vehicle was apparently at the Sector 25 under-bridge moving towards City Centre.\n\n(Representative Image: BCCL)\n\n\u201cThe picture of the car is correct but when I checked the details of the challan, I found that it said my speed was 47 kmph. It is bizarre as no road in Noida has a maximum speed limit of 40 kmph,\u201d Sharma was quoted as saying in the report.\n\nDon't Miss 131 SHARES 706 SHARES 115 SHARES 209 SHARES\n\nCiting the challan, Sharma was asked to pay Rs 2,000 at first. It was only when he confronted the traffic police they admitted that it was a technical fault.\n\nDeeming the challan a \u201cmistake\u201d, SP (traffic) Anil Jha clarified that the maximum speed for four-wheelers in municipal areas is 70 kmph.\n\nSince we can see that the traffic challan system in place is not aloof to mistakes, it is always a good idea to check the challan issued to your vehicle properly, if any. Recently, an incident came to light wherein a Ghaziabad man was issued 15 e-challans for his vehicle even when the vehicle was parked at his home. It was only when he investigated the matter himself that he got to know that another vehicle with a similar make as his was using a duplicate number plate and was the real culprit.", "description": "A Noida resident has recently been issued an absurd over speeding challan.
