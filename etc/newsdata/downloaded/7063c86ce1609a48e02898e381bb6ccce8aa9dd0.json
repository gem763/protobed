The sky, amber-hued as the sun sets; the Tagus river and accompanying Ponte 25 de Abril bridge, sparkling roguishly in the distance; the storybook-perfect Castelo St Jorge, set high upon a hill in all its glory. I look, and look and look \u2013 but I don\u2019t reach for my smartphone.\n\nYes, ladies and gentleman \u2013 I may be the only travel writer on the planet who doesn\u2019t have Instagram. I\u2019m not alone but I\u2019m certainly in the minority if a hasty Twitter poll is anything to go by; of 57 respondents, 82 per cent claimed to be on the \u2019gram.\n\nFriends and colleagues never fail to meet my app absenteeism with disbelief. \u201cBut you go to all those amazing places!\u201d they say. \u201cIt\u2019s such a waste!\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nMy standard response is a curt, \u201cI don\u2019t like taking photos or looking at other people\u2019s.\u201d Which usually stumps them.\n\nThey\u2019re right in one respect. I do get the opportunity to visit some phenomenal spots \u2013 luxury hotels with infinity pools, white sand beaches lapped by cobalt waves, Michelin-starred restaurants with tasting menus so damn good I feel drunk on decadence. (Do you hate me yet?)\n\nMuch of it is Insta-heaven, just begging to be caught, captioned and catapulted onto the internet\u2019s favourite photo-sharing platform. But, while I obviously love heading out into the world to explore and experience, I haven\u2019t the slightest desire to distil each destination into one staged shot, timed to perfection and filtered beyond all recognition. That doesn\u2019t feel like telling the story of a place to me.\n\nBy its very nature, Instagram demands that users pick and choose what to show (and show off). Inevitably it\u2019s the ugly, the uncomfortable or the just plain boring aspects of travel \u2013 and of life \u2013 that get edited out. Journalists are, first and foremost, storytellers, and the idea of highlighting only the bright and shiny parts of somewhere \u2013 the parts guaranteed to garner those all-important likes \u2013 doesn\u2019t sit quite right with me.\n\nIt probably (read definitely) sounds pretentious, but the most exciting aspect of travelling for me is the act of wrestling each fresh place into language: how to best describe the colour of those leaves? The taste of that dessert? The feel of that breeze? How to extract the essence of each experience in all its gritty, gorgeous reality? A picture may be worth a thousand words, but a thousand words can reflect a trip in a way one over-saturated image cannot.\n\nTravel influencers also have a lot to answer for when it comes to promoting \u201cbad behaviour\u201d to get the money shot \u2013 just this summer, influencer Elisabeth Brentano, otherwise known as Elizabeth on the Road, started her petition \u201cEncouraging the social media generation to behave more responsibly outdoors\u201d, calling for individuals to understand the negative impact their actions can have on the planet.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s only half the story. Truth time: what really freaks me out about Instagram is the idea of how closely tied my fragile ego would be to my travels.\n\nIt would be nice to think that, when we post things on social media, it\u2019s done merely for the pleasure of sharing our lives and connecting with others; we just want to be part of that big, beautiful conversation.\n\nIt would be nice \u2013 but it wouldn\u2019t be true. For most of us, it\u2019s the endorphin rush of seeing those numbers climb \u2013 follows, likes, shares, comments \u2013 that keeps us coming back for more. Whether we like it or not, we are all approval junkies for whom those figures are inherently bound up in our self-worth. In the era of the ubiquitous selfie, how could you not associate thousands of likes with the idea that thousands of people like you? And, conversely, that a dearth of interactions means you\u2019re essentially an online pariah?\n\nIt happens on every platform, but Instagram is one of the worst offenders when it comes to filtering the realness out of real life and making us feel our value can be measured numerically.\n\nTo be frank, I just don\u2019t think I could hack it. I can already see how things would go \u2013 here\u2019s me enjoying that Lisbon skyline. Here\u2019s me honing the shot to find the best angle, filtering it so the buildings really pop, cropping out the messy table in front of me. Here\u2019s me posting it. And, several hours later, here\u2019s me checking it, and rechecking it, and rechecking it, ad infinitum, to see how many interactions I\u2019ve had. I ignore the sweeping landscape before me; I ignore the cocktail in my glass; I even ignore the person sitting opposite me. I don\u2019t need a crystal ball to see my inescapable Instagram future.\n\nInstead, free from such constraints, I\u2019m able to live \u2013 not just in the moment, but in the place. I devour the view with my eyes, rather than observing it second-hand through a screen. I savour each sip of the velvety espresso martini in my hand. I talk and listen and laugh with my companion, who is far more deserving of my attention than a collection of strangers online.\n\nAnd that will always be worth more to me than a million meaningless pats on the back from people who don\u2019t know me: the chance to turn outwards to see the world, rather than turning inwards so the world sees me.", "description": "Gazing out over the picturesque expanse of Lisbon from my hotel\u2019s rooftop bar, its pastel-shaded, higgledy piggledy buildings interspersed with verdant trees, I try to take it all in.
