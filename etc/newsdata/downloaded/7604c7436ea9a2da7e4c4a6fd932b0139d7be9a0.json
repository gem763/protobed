They yelled, \"Take off your masks!\" One person was arrested.\n\nPolice later fired multiple rounds of tear gas into a crowd who were jeering and chanting slogans of the pro-democracy movement. They cleared the streets before retreating into the station, which had been closed to commuters.\n\nViolence also broke out in Tuen Mun, in the New Territories, police said, where protesters built barricades and damaged government offices.\n\n\n\n\n\nUSE OF FORCE\n\nLocal media Now TV and Cable TV reported the changes to the police procedures manual took effect on Sept. 30, the day before Tuesday's violence at widespread protests on China's National Day, during which the student was shot.\n\nReuters could not confirm when the changes were made, but has seen police documents that showed changes to some guidelines on how officers could act when considering force.\n\nThe updated guidelines also removed a line that said \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\", stating only that \"officers on the ground should exercise their own discretion to determine what level of force is justified in a given situation\".\n\nPolice declined to comment when asked if amendments had been made to the manual.\n\n\"The guidelines on the use of force involve details of operation. It may affect the normal and effective operation of the police force and work of police on crime prevention if details are made public,\" police said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nHong Kong's police have long been admired for their professionalism compared with some forces elsewhere in Asia.\n\nBut the public has become increasingly hostile towards the force over past weeks amid accusations of heavy-handed tactics. Police say they have shown restraint.\n\nThe unrest, which began over opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial, shows no sign of letting up.\n\nTony Tsang, the 18-year-old who was shot at close range as he fought an officer with what appeared to be a white pole, has since been charged with rioting, which carries a maximum 10-year sentence, and assaulting a police officer.", "description": "Hong Kong's government is expected to discuss sweeping emergency laws on Friday that would include banning face masks at protests, two sources told Reuters, as the Chinese-ruled territory grapples with an escalating cycle of violence.
