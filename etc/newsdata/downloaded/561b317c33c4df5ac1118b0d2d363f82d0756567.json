All three hospitals that comprise the DCH Health System in Alabama were closed to new patients as officials attempted to deal with the paralyzing computer system attack.\n\nThe DCH Regional Medical Center in Tuscaloosa, Northport Medical Center, and Fayette Medical Center were all turning away \u201call but the most critical new patients\u201d this week. Ambulances were instructed to take patients to other nearby hospitals when possible.\n\nDCH representatives wrote in a release: \u201cA criminal is limiting our ability to use our computer systems in exchange for an as-yet unknown payment. Our hospitals have implemented our emergency procedures to ensure safe and efficient operations in the event technology dependent on computers is not available.\u201d\n\nRansomware attacks are designed to encrypt hard drives and lock individuals out of their computer until they pay a ransom, usually sent via cryptocurrency, to the attacker. Seven hospitals in Australia were also affected by the cyber attack.\n\nHospitals in Gippsland and southwest Victoria said that they were rescheduling some patient services as they responded to a \u201ccyber health incident.\u201d Hospital officials said in a statement: \u201cThe cyber incident, which was uncovered on Monday, has blocked access to several systems by the infiltration of ransomware, including financial management. Hospitals have isolated and disconnected a number of systems\u2026 to quarantine the infection.\u201d\n\nHospital officials stated that they were working with the police and the Australian Cyber Security Center to deal with the incident but computer systems at the seven hospitals remained locked 24 hours after the cyber attack. One official stated that it would take weeks to secure and restore damaged networks.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
