We seem to play better against the better sides. We can\u00b4t take that for granted we\u00b4ve got to focus and it\u00b4s going to be a heck of a game.\"\n\nWales have not had the rub of the green at the last two tournaments, pipped 9-8 by France in the 2011 semi-finals after Sam Warburton was red carded early.\n\nThey suffered a horror run of injuries to fall in the quarter-finals to South Africa four years ago in England.\n\nGatland said the 2015 experience had set them on a mission to build depth to withstand the attrition of a long tournament in Japan.\n\n\"We feel like we've done that,\" he said.\n\n\"To be able to go into a quarter-final knowing that you've got 31 players to be able to be fit and training puts us in a pretty good position than what we had in 2015.\"\n\n(Reporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Toby Davis)", "description": "By Ian RansomKUMAMOTO, Japan, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Wales coach Warren Gatland said the scrappy win over dogged Uruguay on Sunday was", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
