When I couldn\u2019t have any more children after my daughter Charlotte, they kind of became my babies.\u201d\n\nGareth and Maria, who is a teacher from Pontypridd, south Wales, have now paid \u00a313,000 in vet fees to fight health issues which have plagued eight-year-old Bella.\n\nNow the family admit they are under \u201cmassive strain\u201d financially.\n\nMaria is unable to work while she recovers from a complete hysterectomy after years of suffering from tumours and endometriosis.\n\nThey've now created a Gofundme page in a bid to raise the \u00a38,000 required for the dog's treatment.\n\n(Image: bristolpost.co.uk)\n\nMaria, who is a mum, continued: \u201cIf there\u2019s a chance here with this specialist surgery, I want to give it one last shot.\n\n\u201cIf Bella can spend her remaining years being able to actually run and play on this planet, then I want that so much for her.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a really affectionate dog, with a lovely temperament. She loves life.\"\n\nThe Shih Tzu was born with weakness in her hind legs. She and Len were taken in by Maria\u2019s family shortly after their births.\n\nMaria continued: \u201cThe family we took her from said she was just going to be used as a breeding dog.\n\n\u201cThey warned us she wasn\u2019t well, but we felt sorry for her. Charlotte, who\u2019s now 18, was born with weakness in her left side too.\n\n\u201cShe immediately picked Bella and said, \u2018Can we have her because she has a bad leg like me?\u2019 We couldn\u2019t just leave her there.\u201d\n\npoll loading Would you spend your wedding fund to save your pet? 0+ VOTES SO FAR Yes - my pet is part of my family No - As much as I love my pet, my wedding would come first\n\n(Image: bristolpost.co.uk)\n\nOver the following years, Bella suffered through a series of leg breaks, torn cruciate ligaments and muscle pain.\n\n\u201cDespite this, she is such a happy, loving, gentle girl,\u201d Maria said. \u201cShe\u2019s always smiling with her little crooked teeth.\n\n\u201cIn July this year, Bella ruptured her left cruciate ligament and injured her left kneecap in the process.\n\n\u201cShe has had three surgeries since 2017, so we were really worried that another one would be too much for her, but we booked her in, hoping it would be the last time she would need it done.\u201d\n\nTwo days before Bella\u2019s surgery date in July, she jumped off the sofa and completely ruptured her right cruciate ligament, as well as badly injuring her right kneecap.\n\n\u201cWhen her right leg went, it was such a blow,\u201d Maria said.\n\n\u201cShe was crying and couldn\u2019t put any weight on it. It was horrible to see her in pain.\u201d\n\n(Image: bristolpost.co.uk)\n\nBella was taken in for emergency surgery on her right leg, but her tissue is not knitting together as vets hoped it would.\n\nThe dog is lame on her right side, unable to even toe-tap on the floor, while her left side is deteriorating.\n\nMaria said: \u201cAt this point the vet said we had tried everything so it wouldn\u2019t be the incorrect decision to let her go to sleep.\u201d\n\nLangford Small Animal Hospital in North Somerset proposed the last resort of an \u00a38,000 surgery, which would see Bella given new metal knees by one of the top specialists in the country.\n\n\u201cAs I cried to the vet, I went over and over it all, and as much as I hate the idea of my little girl going under anaesthetic again, and having major surgery again, I just can\u2019t bring myself to say yes to having her put down,\u201d Maria said.\n\nThe family\u2019s vet said the operation would have a 95 per cent chance of being a permanent fix.\n\n(Image: bristolpost.co.uk)\n\nMaria said: \u201cIt feels strange to reach out to the world for financial support. You don\u2019t realise how much pride you have, until you have to swallow it.\n\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m scared that we won\u2019t make it, but honestly, it\u2019s worth the risk, and every penny counts.\u201d\n\nThe Gofundme page has so far raised \u00a3847 towards the target and Maria has been shocked by the kindness of strangers.\n\nShe revealed one woman, whose own dog had to be put down, was so moved by Bella\u2019s story she has been selling cups and t-shirts emblazoned with the dog\u2019s image to raise money.\n\nMaria said: \u201cShe\u2019s a complete stranger, just very kind. It\u2019s nice to see people get it, and don\u2019t think we\u2019re being dramatic or silly.\n\n\u201cA couple of people have been donating a little something every time they get their paycheck. It\u2019s really heartwarming.\u201d\n\nThe family hopes to raise the money for the operation as quickly as possible so Bella is out of pain soon.\n\nYou can donate to the fundraiser here .", "description": "Maria Grace and her partner Gareth, from Pontypridd, south Wales, now want help from strangers to save Shih Tzu Bella's life", "authors": ["Conor Gogarty", "Image", "Bristolpost.Co.Uk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20655765.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_THP_CHP_191019Slug_10977JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
