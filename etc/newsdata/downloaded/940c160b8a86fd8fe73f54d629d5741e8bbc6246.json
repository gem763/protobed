And what they ultimately decide will determine whether consumer borrowing costs and bank savings rates will continue to edge down.\n\nFor the record, Fed officials have been circumspect even about their immediate plans, repeating that they \u201cwill act as appropriate to sustain the expansion\u201d but stopping short of providing a clear sign that they will lower rates this week. Yet a gauge of upcoming fed moves \u2013 fed fund futures markets \u2013 says there\u2019s a 93% chance of a rate cut, and Fed officials have said nothing to contradict that assumption.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s very unlikely (the Fed\u2019s policy committee) will disappoint the market,\u201d says economist Michael Feroli of JPMorgan Chase. If it did, the resulting drop in stocks and rise in longer-term interest rate could hurt the economy, making the Fed\u2019s task even more difficult.\n\nThe bigger issue is that the Fed is at a crossroads in its campaign to reduce rates to head off a potential recession. After this week\u2019s anticipated move, the Fed will have trimmed its federal funds rate by a quarter percentage three times since late July. That would equal the 0.75 percentage points in cuts the Fed enacted in 1995-96 and 1998.\n\nThat milestone is significant because those 1990s-era reductions, like the current ones, have been made while the economy is still growing. The goal is to ward off a recession rather than to lift the economy from a downturn. In other words, a slump would require a more dramatic lowering of rates.\n\nSporty SUV?: Ford hopes 'Mustang-inspired' SUV will shock Tesla, electric vehicle world\n\nTaking a break from rate cuts?\n\nMany Fed policymakers likely believe they should now take a breather \u201cto let the full effect of lower interest rates run its course,\u201d Morgan Stanley said in a research note. Put simply, it takes time for rate cuts to reduce borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, spurring growth. So why not see if the three rate reductions so far have done the trick?\n\nThat\u2019s especially the case since the economy isn\u2019t in dire straits and there\u2019s always some concern that slicing rates too much could eventually ignite inflation or risky bubbles in stocks and other assets.\n\nSince the Fed last cut rates in mid-September, a split-screen U.S. economy has persisted. A sluggish global economy and the U.S.-China trade war have hurt manufacturing and business investment, while job growth and consumer spending have slowed but remain solid.\n\nFeroli notes, however, that two clouds over the economy have dissipated somewhat. The U.S. has reached a trade deal with China that partly resolves the two countries\u2019 differences. And the risk of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d that doesn\u2019t include agreements between Britain and Europe has been reduced. Also, long-term Treasury yields have risen above short-term rates again after that traditional relationship reversed over the summer, signaling a dim outlook.\n\nBreaking bad: 5 bad money habits you're probably guilty of and how to break them\n\nFeroli believes the Fed will modify the observation in its statement that \u201cuncertainties\u201d about its economic outlook remain, perhaps noting they\u2019ve been offset by the rate cuts so far.\n\nGoldman Sachs argues the Fed will go further, replacing its assertion that it will \u201cact as appropriate to sustain the expansion\u201d with language that could signal even more clearly that the Fed isn\u2019t on course to trim rates again in December, unless the economy worsens.\n\nThat message would serve a couple of purposes. Fed policymakers are sharply divided over whether rate cuts are needed and several have said they should provide the public more clarity on when they\u2019ll end, according to minutes of a Fed meeting in September. A change in the statement language would appease that faction, Feroli says.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The Fed is expected to cut interest rates again this week but attention will focus on signals it gives about whether more reductions are coming", "authors": ["Paul Davidson", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oQwDSNo3D9UX3FjIm6JhdA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/3f110fe3-aab0-44f8-8b2c-83cc58f9bea4/79c1c4e7-5429-5196-b9d9-408610798602/data_3_0.jpg?s=9258bffdfd023b656abe7355b6b35c8a&c=609fd0390cf2c2c4599e159d67548ed5&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
