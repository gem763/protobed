We have to be clinical. When people talk about the Champions League being the target, we\u2019re still not ready... we can still improve.\u201d\n\nCity lead the league scoring charts with 29 goals this season, seven more than Liverpool, and despite his criticism, Guardiola said he was pleased with the forwards at his disposal.\n\nJesus was drafted into the starting line-up for the Palace game in place of Argentina international Sergio Aguero, who was involved in a minor car accident on his way to training on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cTo compete with Sergio is maybe the most difficult thing... but Gabriel is so calm,\u201d Guardiola added. \u201cEvery training session he fights like an animal but he can improve.\u201d\n\nCity are next in action in the Champions League, where they host Italy\u2019s Atalanta on Tuesday.", "description": "Manchester City will not win the Champions League this season unless they become more clinical in front of goal, manager Pep Guardiola said, after his team's 2-0 Premier League away win at Crystal Palace over the weekend.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443264099&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0F3", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
