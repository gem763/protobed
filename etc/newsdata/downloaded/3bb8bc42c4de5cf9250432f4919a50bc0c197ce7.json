That we should leave the EU on October 31. And that is what I will say to the EU, and report back to the house.\n\n\u201cOne way or another, we will leave the EU with this deal.\u201d\n\nSome MPs who had been considering backing Johnson\u2019s deal said they could not accept such a truncated debate. The legislation was only published late on Monday, and the chancellor, Sajid Javid, declined to publish an economic analysis of its impact.\n\nThe House of Commons had earlier backed the second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill, by 329 votes to 299 \u2013 a wider than expected majority of 30.\n\nThat appeared to signal there was potential support for the prime minister\u2019s deal, although some of the Labour MPs who supported it said they could withdraw their backing at a later stage in its progress through the House of Commons if they were unable to amend it.\n\nJohnson said after the first vote: \u201cMay I say how welcome it is, even joyful, that for the first time in this long saga this house has accepted its responsibilities, come together and embraced a deal \u2026 We should not overlook the significance of this moment.\u201d\n\nMPs have tabled a string of amendments to the bill, on issues including a customs union, environmental standards, and avoiding the risk of a no-deal exit at the end of 2020.\n\nThe Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said before the votes: \u201cWe will seek a very clear commitment to a customs union, a strong single market relationship, hardwired commitments on workers\u2019 rights, non-regression of environmental standards, and loopholes closed to avoid the threat of a no-deal Brexit once and for all.\u201d\n\nLabour whips had earlier offered to discuss an alternative programme motion with the government, but Johnson was determined to make a final attempt to achieve his \u201cdo or die\u201d deadline of leaving the EU on Halloween.\n\nIt is unclear whether the prime minister will pull his deal and ask parliament to back a general election instead.\n\nPlay Video 1:53 Boris Johnson says he will withdraw Brexit bill if MPs reject government's timetable \u2013 video\n\nThe EU27 appears likely to grant the delay to Brexit requested in the letter the prime minister reluctantly sent on Saturday evening, in compliance with the Benn act.\n\nThe rebellion against the programme motion was led by the former Tory chancellor Philip Hammond, and one of Johnson\u2019s leadership rivals, Rory Stewart. They were keen to secure reassurances that if the government had not succeeded in negotiating a free trade agreement with the EU27 by the end of 2020, the UK would not leave without a deal.\n\nHammond told the Times the bill was \u201ca camouflage to a no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020\u201d. Stewart, another of the 21 Tories who had the party whip withdrawn last month, said he and some of his fellow rebels had negotiated through the night to give parliament more control over the next phase of the Brexit negotiations, including being able to vote for an extension to the talks.\n\nDuring six hours of debate in the Commons on Tuesday, Dominic Grieve, the former Tory attorney general, accused the prime minister of \u201cbullying\u201d tactics.\n\nThe justice secretary, Robert Buckland, winding up the debate for the government, made a last-minute concession to soft-Brexit Tories.\n\nIn response to a question from his predecessor David Gauke, he said the government would bring forward an amendment offering MPs a vote on extending the transition period by July next year, and that it would abide by it.\n\nNick Thomas-Symonds, closing the debate for Labour, condemned \u201ca flawed bill implementing a fundamentally bad deal\u201d, and said the timetable was far too brief.\n\n\u201cThis government, having tried unlawfully to shut down parliament altogether, now tries to shut down the ability of members to properly scrutinise the most important piece of legislation that\u2019s been brought to this house for generations,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWeariness with the politics of the past three years is no good reason to wave through a bill of such huge significance in less than 36 hours.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 0:49 'Longer choosing a sofa': Labour MP on time given by Boris Johnson to debate Brexit bill \u2013 video\n\nResponding for the government, Buckland \u2013 a former remain supporter who said the 2016 referendum result had been \u201ca bitter blow\u201d \u2013 said the overwhelming message from voters was to \u201cjust get on with it\u201d.\n\nHe appealed to MPs to back both the second reading and the programme motion, saying a Brexit date of 31 October was vital for keeping the trust of the EU.\n\n\u201cThe time for decision making is now. The time for proposing nothing, opposing everything, and seeking to play old-fashioned politics is over.\u201d", "description": "PM fails to restrict scrutiny of bill to just three days in effort to meet 31 October deadline", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "The Civil Servant", "Rafael Behr", "Tom Kibasi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57bee494ea1b14acb0cc4370d70e4005444dd62e/57_0_1710_1026/master/1710.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2c717c0d3bb395abdc418a4c6a0ea8ce", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
