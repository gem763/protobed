But they will likely have an impact on agricultural and other sectors of the European economy, at a time when other tariff battles have dented global trade growth.\n\nThe EU\u2019s top trade official responded to the announcement by saying the bloc would prefer to reach a settlement with the United States to avoid a tariff war _ but it will respond if President Donald Trump imposes new duties on EU products.\n\nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said a tariff war \u201cwould only inflict damage on businesses and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic, and harm global trade and the broader aviation industry at a sensitive time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. decides to impose WTO authorized countermeasures, it will be pushing the EU into a situation where we will have no other option than to do the same,\u201d she said.\n\nItaly\u2019s Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, who was meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Rome on Wednesday, vowed to \u201cdefend our businesses.\u201d Italian wine and cheeses could face an impact from U.S. tariffs.\n\nThe award is the largest among about two dozen at the WTO since it was created nearly 25 years ago. The previous record of $4 billion came in 2002, when the WTO ruled against the U.S. over the Foreign Sales Corporation law, saying it had allowed for illegal subsidies to some U.S. businesses.\n\nUnlike Trump\u2019s unilateral tariffs on billions of dollars-worth of steel, aluminum and other goods from China, the EU and elsewhere, the retaliatory tariffs authorized in the Airbus case have the stamp of approval from the WTO, an organization that he has repeatedly criticized.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledged \u201cwe have lost a matter under WTO law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis means it\u2019s not some sort of arbitrary question but a verdict according to international law that now weighs on Airbus, one must sadly say,\u201d she told reporters in Berlin. \u201cWe have to see how the Americans will react now.\u201d\n\nA May 2018 WTO ruling in the case found EU \u201claunch aid\u201d for Airbus had resulted in lost sales for Boeing in the twin-aisle and very-large-aircraft markets. The ruling centered on Airbus\u2019 350XWB \u2014 a rival of Boeing\u2019s 787 \u2014 and the double-decker A380, which tops the Boeing 747 as the world\u2019s largest commercial passenger plane.\n\nThe case itself dates to 2004, a testament to the plodding and thorough rhythm of the Geneva-based trade body.\n\nThe Trump administration has been demanding reform of the WTO and has been blocking new appointments to its crucial Appellate Body \u2014 which could be rendered inactive in December unless the U.S. gets its way.\n\nThe WTO is already examining a dozen cases involving U.S. tariffs and countermeasures brought by its trading partners over the administration\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs. Trump has insisted the move is needed to protect U.S. national security interests, but the Europeans claim it is simply protectionism and breaks global trade rules.\n\nThe EU has introduced \u201crebalancing\u201d tariffs on about 2.8 billion euros ($3 billion) of U.S. steel, agricultural and other products. Trump has also threatened to slap duties on European automakers.\n\n___\n\nAP Writers Lorne Cook in Brussels, Frank Jordans in Berlin, and Giada Zampano in Rome contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The World Trade Organization says the United States can impose tariffs on up to $7.5 billion worth of goods from the European Union as retaliation for illegal subsidies that the bloc gave to plane-maker Airbus -- a record award from the trade body.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jamey Keaten"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/02/us_europe_trade_63442_c0-275-4488-2891_s1770x1032.jpg?95244caa79ff47da5df17c35d0a85497aab38fcc"}
