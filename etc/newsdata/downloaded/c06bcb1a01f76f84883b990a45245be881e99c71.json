It wouldn't surprise me if it ends up around that range, even without China.\"\n\nREAD MORE: 'Star Wars' is a box-office juggernaut but has struggled for years in China. Disney wants to change that.\n\nThe incredibly violent \"Joker\" has not been approved for release in China (neither was \"Deadpool\"). A Warner Bros. representative did not immediately return a request for comment from Business Insider on a potential China release.\n\nBut if \"Joker\" were to be miraculously released in China, there's precedent for its success. Another R-rated comic-book movie, \"Logan,\" grossed $106 million in the region (and $619 million worldwide).\n\n\"'Joker,' over the course of just three weekends, has become the most talked about movie of the year, weathered the early storm of security concerns, and turned the frown of controversy upside down to make it a selling point rather than a problem,\" Paul Dergarabedian, the Comscore senior media analyst, said.\n\nDergarabedian also projected that \"Joker\" will make more than $850 million worldwide by the end of its theatrical run. Jeff Bock, the Exhibitor Relations senior box-office analyst, told Business Insider that $900 million is likely.\n\nBut can it be the first R-rated movie to hit $1 billion? Without China, box-office experts are skeptical.\n\n\"I'm not sure 'Joker' has enough legs to hit $1 billion worldwide, but that we're even talking about that is an achievement,\" Loria said.\n\n\"If 'Joker' had a China date, we could easily be talking about $1 billion worldwide,\" Bock said. \"It should have another great week domestically, but after Halloween, competition gets a bit more treacherous with 'Terminator: Dark Fate' and 'Doctor Sleep' waiting to jack 'Joker's' box office.\"", "description": "\"Joker\" has not been approved for release in China, but is on track to surpass \"Deadpool\" as the highest-grossing R-rated movie ever.", "authors": ["Travis Clark"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5dadbbc54af909018d7dd6a4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
