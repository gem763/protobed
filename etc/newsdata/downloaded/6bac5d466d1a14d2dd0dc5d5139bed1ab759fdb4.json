The focus of the sequence is Yosemite National Park, where Adams spent a great deal of time.\n\nAdams is known for his black-and-white landscape photography and as an environmentalist.\n\nMichael Adams, son of Ansel Adams, told USA TODAY that the photographer first visited the park when he was 14, in 1916.\n\n\"He went back every year of his life thereafter. He met his wife-to-be in Yosemite in 1921,\" Michael Adams says. \"He lived there off and on, part-time and full-time for many of those years. He enjoyed all of the seasons in Yosemite and it was 'home' for many years.\"\n\nMoon and Half Dome, 1960 (Photo: Ansel Adams, \u00a9The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust)\n\nMichael Adams was born in Yosemite in 1933. Now, he visits multiple times each year.\n\nIn the book, readers can see how much Yosemite meant to the photography icon.\n\n\"He was so committed to this one national park, and I think that in the book you get a great sense of how much Yosemite meant to him and was a part of him,\" Souza says.\n\nWhile Souza never met Adams, he wrote in the forward foreword that he and his friends became obsessed with Adams' craftsmanship and precision. They tried their best to emulate his framing and composition.\n\nRoyal Arches, Washington Column and the Base of the North Dome, c. 1940 (Photo: Ansel Adams, \u00a9The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust)\n\nMichael Adams says that the appeal of his father's photographs is universal and continues today.\n\nThis particular sequence of photos has never been published in book form until now.\n\n\"He would be thrilled to have all of his special edition prints both formally recognized and all published in one book,\" Alan Ross, Adams' darkroom assistant, told USA TODAY.\n\nLower Yosemite Fall, c. 1946 (Photo: Ansel Adams, \u00a9The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust)\n\nPlan a visit: These are the most popular national park sites in each state\n\nProposal: Seeks to privatize, modernize campgrounds at national parks\n\nAccording to the book jacket, Adams initially selected eight photographs in the late 1950s of Yosemite to offer to park visitors as affordable souvenirs to inspire others to have a respect for nature that he felt himself.\n\nHe continued adding to that collection over the decades.\n\nWhile Adams spent time at Yosemite throughout his life, Souza has only been once: He visited with the Obama family in 2016, one century after Adams first visited himself.\n\n\"It's a little overwhelming because Ansel spent so much time there and was there for different seasons and the light was right, and I was there for two days,\" Souza says.\n\nFern Spring, Dusk, c. 1961 (Photo: Ansel Adams, \u00a9The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust)\n\nSouza spent the trip taking in the beauty of Yosemite and imagining Adams walking the same trails he was and setting up his big tripod to get the right shot.\n\nWhile there, he used his digital camera on a black-and-white setting while hiking with the Obamas.\n\n\"So I could make believe I was Ansel Adams,\" Souza says.\n\nFollow Morgan Hines on Twitter: @MorganEmHines.\n\nHalf Dome, Oak Trees, Autumn, c. 1938 (Photo: Ansel Adams, \u00a9The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust)\n\nHalf Dome, Merced River, Winter, 1938 (Photo: Ansel Adams, \u00a9The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust)\n\nUpper Yosemite Fall and Apple Blossoms, c. 1945 (Photo: Ansel Adams, \u00a9The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust)\n\nCathedral Rocks, c. 1949 (Photo: Ansel Adams, \u00a9The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust)\n\nMerced River, Cliffs of Cathedral Rocks, Autumn, 1939 (Photo: Ansel Adams, \u00a9The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust)\n\nYellow Pine Bark and Pine Needles, c. 1972 (Photo: Ansel Adams, \u00a9The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust)\n\nSequoia Roots, c. 1950 (Photo: Ansel Adams, \u00a9The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust)\n\nAutumn Tree Against Cathedral Rocks, c. 1944 (Photo: Ansel Adams, \u00a9The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust)\n\nFir Forest in Snow, Wawona Road, c. 1948 (Photo: Ansel Adams, \u00a9The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust)\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/national-parks/2019/10/29/yosemite-ansel-adams-book-intro-white-house-photographer-pete-souza/2484304001/", "description": "'Ansel Adams' Yosemite: The Special Edition Prints' comes out Tuesday with a foreword written by former White House photographer Pete Souza.", "authors": ["Morgan Hines", "Published P.M.
