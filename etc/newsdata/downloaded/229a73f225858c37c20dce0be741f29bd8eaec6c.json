We'll pretty much go with more or less the same team.\n\n'We believe that's the way we can get the best out of our team and we believe that's the longevity of playing so many games in a six-day turnaround, rotating forwards and stuff like that.\n\n'It's a bit of horses for courses but we believe it's our most in-fit, form, best available, best combination team so there's a bit of both.'\n\nKolbe celebrates the semi-final win over Wales, which he missed, with Damian de Allende\n\nAnd he accepts criticism that the Boks are dull. They kicked the ball 41 times against Wales, and won with a largely limited game-plan \u2013 using their massive pack and strong mauling game, with little ingenuity on show.\n\nBut Erasmus does not care, as long as his side wins, highlighting the fact that they have had to battle their way to this point.\n\n'If one understands where we have come from \u2013 we have been No 6, 7 and 8 in the world \u2013 we have got certain challenges and one of them was to redeem ourselves and become a power again in world rugby and try and get to No 1 and 2,' Erasmus explained.\n\n'By doing that you have to have some building blocks in place and we have followed a certain route and play according to the stats and the way the game is being refereed currently and what gives you short term good results on the scoreboard.\n\nErasmus accepts criticism of South Africa's 'boring' style - but is pleased with the results\n\n'We certainly accept that there are some things in our game that we have to improve and we take it on the chin and we will keep on improving that.\n\n'But we have put ourselves in a position to maybe win the World Cup and we are in the final.\n\n'Yes we accept the criticism but we are also happy we are in a position to compete in a World Cup final which is ultimately where we want to be.\n\n'There's not a hell of a lot in your tactics than you can change in six days.'", "description": "WILL KELLEHER IN TOKYO: Rassie Erasmus confirmed that hot-stepping Springbok Cheslin Kolbe will be fit for the World Cup final - as he admitted South Africa can be boring.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/05/20312466-0-image-a-6_1572327030780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
