REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov\n\nThe Chinese vessel, the Haiyang Dizhi 8, was speeding away from Vietnam\u2019s exclusive economic zone towards China on Thursday under the escort of at least two Chinese ships, according to data from Marine Traffic, a website that tracks vessels.\n\nChina claims almost all the energy-rich waters of the South China Sea but neighbors Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims.\n\nTension between Hanoi and Beijing escalated when China sent the vessel to conduct seismic surveys in waters off Vietnam in early July.\n\nThe foreign ministry in Hanoi has repeatedly accused the vessel and its escorts of violating Vietnam\u2019s sovereignty and has demanded China remove its ships from the area.\n\nThe ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters email seeking comment on Thursday.\n\nPolice broke up a brief protest in August outside the Chinese embassy in Hanoi over the vessel.\n\nAsked about the Chinese ship, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said it had \u201cstarted its scientific survey in Chinese-controlled waters in early July\u201d.\n\n\u201cAccording to our understanding the work is presently complete,\u201d she told a daily news briefing in Beijing.\n\nThe vice chairman of China\u2019s Central Military Commission, Xu Qiliang, called for dialogue this week at a meeting with Vietnam\u2019s Defense Minister Ngo Xuan Lich in Beijing to address the complex global and regional situation, the official Vietnamese News Agency reported on Wednesday.\n\nIt quoted Lich as saying that the joint efforts of all countries could help to cope with common security challenges.\n\n\u2018NEVER COMPROMISE\u2019\n\nHa Hoang Hop at the International Institute for Strategic Studies said China only withdrew the vessel shortly after the oil rig Hakuryu-5 completed drilling at Vietnam\u2019s Block 06.1, which is operated by Russian state oil firm Rosneft (ROSN.MM).\n\n\u201cChina doesn\u2019t want any non-ASEAN companies to drill for oil in the South China Sea,\u201d said Hop, who is also a visiting senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.\n\n\u201cChina is determined to pressure Vietnam to end joint oil exploration and production with foreign partners in the area.\u201d\n\nChinese coastguard ships have also been operating within the oil block since the standoff began, the Marine Traffic data showed.\n\nRosneft did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.\n\nPetroVietnam told Spanish energy firm Repsol last year to halt an offshore oil project under pressure from China, while a subsidiary of Rosneft expressed concern that its recent drilling could upset China.\n\nVietnamese President and Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong called last week for restraint in the South China Sea, saying Vietnam should \u201cnever compromise\u201d on its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A Rosneft Vietnam employee looks on at the Lan Tay gas platform in the South China Sea off the coast of Vung Tau, Vietnam April 29, 2018.

Fiery Cross Reef is a man-made island controlled by China and built on a disputed South China Sea reef. Vietnam and the Philippines have competing claims on the reef.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very likely that China will send an oil rig to drill in the area where the Haiyang Dizhi 8 had conducted seismic surveys in Vietnam\u2019s exclusive economic zone,\u201d Hop said.", "description": "A Chinese oil survey vessel that has been embroiled in a tense standoff with Vietnamese vessels in the South China Sea left Vietnamese-controlled waters on Thursday after more than three months, marine data showed.", "authors": ["Khanh Vu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444436840&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0NY", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
