And Netanyahu last week reportedly considered a major military operation against Gaza.\n\n\u201cCitizens of Israel, we find ourselves at the high point of a historic change in the history of the Jewish people and the State of Israel,\u201d the 69-year-old prime minister wrote in the Maariv newspaper on Monday.\n\nHe claimed he had spent the past three decades fighting to keep Israel\u2019s military presence in the Palestinian territories despite \u201cthe pressures of the Clinton and Obama administration\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am now asking for your confidence so as to complete this historic task and to fortify the State of Israel\u2019s borders and security forever.\u201d\n\nAs part of the eleventh-hour media blitz, Netanyahu said in an interview with Israel Army Radio that he intended \u201cto extend sovereignty on all the settlements and the [settlement] blocs,\u201d including \u201csites that have security importance or are important to Israel\u2019s heritage\u201d.\n\nAsked if that included the hundreds of Jews who live under heavy military guard amid tens of thousands of Palestinians in Hebron, Netanyahu responded: \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nMore than 6.3 million people are eligible to vote at polling stations that will close at 10pm (8pm BST) on Tuesday, after which exit polls will be reported.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Yair Lapid and Benny Gantz, leaders of the Blue and White party, on election billboards in Tel Aviv.

That deadlock could plunge Israel into another political crisis, with the prospect of weeks of tense deal-making or even a third election.\n\nGantz, a security hawk who focused his campaign on Netanyahu\u2019s alleged corruption and anti-democratic moves, also wrote in Monday\u2019s edition of Maariv, slamming the prime minister for \u201cspins and telling lies\u201d.\n\nThe former head of the army, who describes himself as a centrist but also supports annexing Palestinian land, promised he would employ \u201cdisproportionate force\u201d to fight off frequent rocket attacks from Gaza.\n\n\u201cBlue and White under my leadership will change the direction of the ship of state of Israeli democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nAs with every Israeli election, security has been a key issue, with Netanyahu\u2019s opponents attempting to paint him as indecisive and conflict-averse. When the prime minister was whisked away by his security team at a campaign event during a Palestinian militant rocket attack from Gaza, Netanyahu\u2019s political foes jumped on the incident to portray him as weak.\n\nThe local Haaretz newspaper reported on Monday that later that night, Netanyahu had considered launching a significant military operation in Gaza, one that may have delayed the election, but was advised against it. The government denied the report.\n\nIsrael is holding a repeat election just five months after the last one. This time, all eyes will be on Avigdor Lieberman, Netanyahu\u2019s former right-hand man, whose refusal to join a coalition government with Jewish ultra-Orthodox parties in May led to a cascade of events that resulted in the second vote.\n\nHis staunchly secular stance against religious politicians appears to have drawn support from the nonreligious right wing, and he could come out as the kingmaker who decides Israel\u2019s next prime minister.\n\nIsrael elections: why is the country going to the polls again? Read more\n\nLieberman wants Netanyahu to form a unity government with the opposition, but Gantz has ruled out serving with him. Netanyahu, the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history, is also very unlikely to sit in a government headed by anyone but himself.\n\nIn preparation for election day, the military will close crossings with the occupied West Bank, where more than 2.5 million Palestinians live under Israeli rule but cannot vote, and Gaza, where 2 million more live under a blockade.\n\nAs in previous elections, Netanyahu has warned of defeat at the hands of politicians from Israel\u2019s Arab minority and \u201cleftists\u201d in an attempt to boost rightwing turnout. Last week, Facebook temporarily shut down a chatbot on his official page for breaching the company\u2019s hate speech policy after it warned of Arabs who \u201cwant to destroy us all\u201d.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Arab parties could win significant votes after reunifying into a single alliance, similar to 2015 when they became the third-largest force in the Knesset. It is possible they could gather enough seats to block Netanyahu\u2019s premiership.", "description": "Netanyahu campaign has demonised Israel\u2019s Arab minority and vowed to annex much of Palestinian territories", "authors": ["Oliver Holmes", "Raja Shehadeh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f0185a0c95ecfda1a45b6c430a4651d297ab9b1/0_64_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b6ecfce8f37c71a922a8f3ce45f08b9a", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
