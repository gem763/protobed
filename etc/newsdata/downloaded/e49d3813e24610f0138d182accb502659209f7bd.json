Nonetheless, a new study from the Institute for Family Studies finds that there\u2019s a surprisingly clear difference between conservatives and liberals when it comes to marriage: 62 percent of conservatives are married, compared with 39 percent of liberals and 46 percent of moderates. According to the study\u2019s authors, conservatives are more likely to be married even when you control for relevant factors like age.\n\nTwo explanations might account for the gap: that married people are more likely to be conservative, or that conservatives are more likely to get married. In truth, there\u2019s evidence for both propositions.\n\nFamilies provide a certain amount of \u201csocial insurance\u201d \u2014 someone to care for you if you\u2019re sick, or provide backup income if you\u2019re unemployed, or take care of the kids when you need to be elsewhere. If you don\u2019t have those benefits, then you\u2019ll look elsewhere for them \u2014 and today, \u201celsewhere\u201d probably means the government. You\u2019re also likely to be unfriendly to socially conservative messages that suggest you ought to be married.\n\nWhich explains why unmarried women are among the Democratic Party\u2019s strongest constituencies, having gone for Hillary Clinton by 31 points over Donald Trump in 2016. (Married women also supported Clinton, but by a narrow margin, 49 to 47 percent.) And unmarried women with children are even more overwhelmingly Democratic; 74 percent of them voted for Barack Obama in 2008, long before Trump arrived, with news of his adult-film-star payoffs and bragging about molesting women.\n\nBut the IFS study also shows that conservatives do value marriage more than moderates or liberals. Among conservatives, 80 percent say marriage is needed to create strong families; among liberals, that figure is only 33 percent. It\u2019s possible that the causation runs in the other direction \u2014 that conservatives congratulate themselves for a lifestyle they chose for other reasons \u2014 but it\u2019s hard to imagine what those other reasons might be. No, it seems reasonable to assume that more conservatives get married because more conservatives think it\u2019s important to be married, especially before having children.\n\nIn fact, conservatives think it\u2019s so important that they\u2019re panicking about the state of everyone else\u2019s marriage. Conservatives are substantially more likely to say that they\u2019re completely satisfied with their own family life \u2014 52 percent say this, compared with 41 percent of liberals and moderates. But they\u2019re about twice as likely as liberals to say that marriages in general are significantly weaker now than they were just a few years ago, which seems both unlikely and hard to prove. Conservatives are also more likely to think that divorce rates have increased in the past decade, which is just false.\n\nIt would be easy to make fun of conservatives for scaring themselves with dubious statistics. It may be slightly harder to accept that although they\u2019re wrong about the details, conservatives are overwhelmingly right about the big picture: Marriage is incredibly important to both individual and societal health, and any society that loses sight of that truth is ultimately putting itself, and its members, in serious danger.\n\nResearchers have found time and again that married people live longer, happier and more prosperous lives \u2014 and that although some of this may reflect the sort of people who get married, it also reflects an effect of marriage itself.\n\nThat\u2019s especially clear when it comes to children. No government subsidy program, regardless of how generous, can substitute for the benefits of having two adults, not just one, focus their attention and resources on a child\u2019s needs. The benefits are so strong, in fact, that they seem to generate spillover effects: A landmark study of economic mobility found that one of the strongest predictors of income mobility was growing up in a neighborhood with lots of two-parent families, even for a child being raised by a single parent.\n\nAll of this means that it\u2019s entirely appropriate to be gravely worried when 40 percent of kids are born outside marriage. And when you realize that only a third of liberals, and half of moderates, think that marriage is vital to creating strong families, it\u2019s time to panic about where America might be headed.\n\nRead more:\n\nDavid Byler: Conservatives already won the culture war.
