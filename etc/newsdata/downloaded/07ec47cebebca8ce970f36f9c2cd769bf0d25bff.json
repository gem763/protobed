However \u2014 with Vanessa (Michelle Hardwick) very much aware of the truth \u2014 could she be about to expose the culprits in the coming episodes as she\u2019s quizzed by the police?\n\nWith Kerry in hospital following their confrontation, Tracy (Amy Walsh) is wracked with guilt. In an attempt to ease her conscience, both Vanessa and Charity (Emma Atkins) do everything they can to convince her that what happened wasn\u2019t her fault. However, things go from bad to worse when Amy shows up to collect a few things for her mum.\n\nWhilst there, she reveals that she\u2019s planning on telling the police about how Tracy is the person responsible for Kerry\u2019s injuries \u2014 a revelation that leaves Tracy shaken. Once again, Vanessa and Charity come to her aid, reassuring her that Amy wouldn\u2019t risk revealing what transpired and that she\u2019s simply trying to scare her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetermined to defend her sister, Vanessa confronts Amy. An argument between the two women ensues \u2014 during which, Vanessa accidentally hits a nurse. As a result, she\u2019s arrested.\n\nKnowing that Vanessa is at the police station fills Amy with dread, as she ponders whether or not Vanessa will reveal the truth about the fire.\n\nWill Vanessa spill the beans about Kerry and Amy\u2019s involvement in the factory inferno?\n\nFrank was her dad, after all, and she\u2019ll likely be determined to get justice for him considering Kerry allowed him to be implicated in the fire knowing full well that he had nothing to do with it.\n\nOr will Vanessa perhaps refrain from telling the truth? After all, doing so could implicate both her and Tracy in regards to Kerry\u2019s current condition.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Is it all over?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/07_10_emm_charity_vanessa_tracy-15ee_1570175713.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
