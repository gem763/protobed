The change was announced quickly, apparently with scant consulting with local organizers or government officials.\n\nThe trigger was probably the recent world track championships in Doha, Qatar, where 28 of 68 starters failed to finish the women\u2019s marathon and 18 of 73 men failed to complete the course. The races were run at midnight in 38 degree C (100 degree F) heat.\n\nEthiopian distance-running great Haile Gebrselassie said athletes \u201ccould have died\u201d in the women\u2019s race.\n\nThe marathons in Tokyo were to start at 6 a.m. to ease the heat effect on runners. The men\u2019s 50-kilometer race walk final was slated for a 5:30 a.m. start.\n\nThe IOC said a final decision would be made after games inspectors visit Tokyo for a meeting on Oct. 30-Nov. 1.\n\nForecast temperatures in Sapporo are \u201cfive to six degrees centigrade (about 10 degrees F) cooler during the day than in Tokyo,\u201d the IOC said.\n\nKoike said she wants the IOC to explain \u201cto all of the games stakeholders, including the citizens of Tokyo.\u201d\n\nA report released last year by the national government\u2019s Board of Audit said Japan is likely to spend $25 billion overall to prepare for the games. This is public money, except for the $5.6 billion in the privately funded operating budget.\n\nOrganizers dispute the figure and say it\u2019s about $12 billion, though what are Olympic costs - and what are not - is subject to heated debate.\n\nTokyo projected total costs of about $7.5 billion in its winning bid for the games in 2013.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nStephen Wade on Twitter: http://twitter.com/StephenWadeAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sapporo officials are thrilled with a proposal to move next year's Tokyo Olympic marathons to the northern Japanese city to avoid the summer heat in the city.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Wade"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/tokyo_marathon_olympics_92977_c0-163-3201-2030_s1200x700.jpg?257346c71b0fac4d2699dfe23de872cb14a18c10", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
