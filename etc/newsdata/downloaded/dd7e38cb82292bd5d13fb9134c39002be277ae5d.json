Because it looks very much like he got this business because of his father\u2019s position.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I understand why a lot of people would complain about that,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is why these people are complaining about that.\u201d\n\nWith that, he cut to a clip of Donald Trump Jr. accusing Hunter Biden of trading on his name and Eric Trump arguing that he and his brother are exempt from criticism because they do not sit on any corporate boards.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m not surprised nobody has put Beavis and Forehead on any corporate boards,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI don\u2019t even think they\u2019re allowed on diving boards.\u201d\n\nBut more importantly, the host said, \u201cIf there was ever an example of people who got opportunities because of their names, it\u2019s these two.\u201d For instance, if Donald Trump Jr. was not Donald Trump\u2019s son, Noah asked why anyone would be paying him $50,000 to make a speech. \u201cTo share his expertise on bad beards?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, if Trump\u2019s sons are actually concerned, like truly concerned about children of politicians doing business overseas,\u201d Noah added, \u201cthen can someone please explain to me why they have been doing this?\u201d\n\nHe then allowed various news reports to lay out the details of continued foreign projects currently being carried out by Eric and Don Jr. on behalf of the Trump Organization. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right, even with their dad in office, the Trumps are still growing their business in places like India, Philippines, Indonesia, Uruguay,\u201d Noah said. \u201cThey\u2019re all over the world. It\u2019s like The Amazing Race with no running and no chins.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cat least Donald and Eric are one step removed from the Trump presidency,\u201d Noah said before turning his attention to Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, who have official roles in the White House and yet still have entanglements with businesses that benefit from foreign money.\n\n\u201cNow let\u2019s be clear,\u201d Noah concluded. \u201cI\u2019m not defending Hunter Biden. I don\u2019t know him. I don\u2019t know about his business. I\u2019m just saying that the last people who should be talking about the blurred lines of family names and political influence are the people currently running their home office from the White House.\u201d", "description": "\u201cThey\u2019re all over the world,\u201d the \u201cDaily Show\u201d host said of Trump\u2019s sons. \u201cIt\u2019s like The Amazing Race with no running and no chins.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1434,w_2549,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571275936/TN_59_txrson", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
