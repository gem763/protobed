The national telecom authority\u2014identified as the technology\u2019s user in the US$18.5-million contract dated December 2018\u2014has acknowledged the program. Sandvine did not respond to The Logic\u2019s request for comment. (Coda Story)\n\nTalking point: A 2010 law requires Pakistani carriers to have traffic monitoring and recording systems in place, and existing rules force them to allow security agencies\u2019 intercepts as a condition of their licences, according to watchdog Privacy International. In 2012, Sandvine said it would not bid for a Pakistani government internet-filtering project, following a petition from Bolo Bhi, a local civil society group. But in July 2017, the $562-million deal saw the firm merge with Procera Networks, a U.S. company that had sold technology to major Turkish carrier T\u00fcrk Telekom over employee worries it would be used for government surveillance. In March 2018, the University of Toronto\u2019s CitizenLab said such a product was being used within T\u00fcrk Telekom\u2019s network to spy on people in Turkey, Egypt and Syria. Sandvine called the report \u201ctechnically inaccurate and intentionally misleading.\u201d It is the same product the company has now sold to Pakistan.", "description": "", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
