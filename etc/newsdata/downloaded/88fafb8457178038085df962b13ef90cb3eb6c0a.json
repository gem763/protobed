And the objective is to never give up,\u201d Endresz says.\n\nHe says the name has plenty of significance for what will surely be the most-colourful team behind any horse that saddles up for the Guineas on Saturday.\n\nFirst there\u2019s trainer David Vandyke, who overcame a heroin addiction early in his life to become one of Queensland\u2019s canniest horsemen.\n\nTrainer David Vandyke (L) and Allan Endresz (R) with Alligator Blood. Arsineh Houspian\n\nThen there\u2019s jockey Ryan Maloney, who has been open about his struggles with depression.\n\nBut Endresz is something else \u2013 a racing identity so colourful you need sunglasses just to read his name in the form guide.\n\nPreviously convicted of market manipulation, twice declared bankrupt and currently banned as a director by the corporate regulator until 2021, Endresz has been engaged in decades of furious litigation against the government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of the cases trace back to the embezzlement of $8.73 million of taxpayer funds by a government consultant in 1998. Some of the funds were transferred to a company associated with Endresz, but he has long denied knowing the funds were embezzled, and was cleared of bribing the consultant.\n\nRyan Maloney rides Alligator Blood to victory in the the Caulfield Guineas Prelude. AAP\n\nBut an attempt by the government to recover that sum by freezing millions of dollars of Endresz\u2019 assets \u2013 including, remarkably, the Illawarra Falcons NBL basketball team \u2013 clearly still burns.\n\nHe is currently waiting on the judgment on his latest legal battle, an appeal against his bankruptcy.\n\nIf Endresz wins that case \u2013 and he has no doubt that he\u2019ll come out victorious, declaring there\u2019s \u201cno way the three judges will get out of the appeal points in my favour\u201d \u2013 then he can pursue his ultimate goal of relaunching a failed $4.3 billion claim against the government for compensation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get it all back,\u201d say Endresz, claiming parallels between his legal fight and the debut win of Alligator Blood. \u201cThat reminded me of how far back I was in the court cases.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how a bankrupt and banned director can own a horse that recently attracted an offer of $2.2 million, then Endresz has a quick answer.\n\nThe horse, like all of his assets, is owned through trusts. His affairs are specifically structured so assets can\u2019t be got at by the courts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have rocks in your heads if you ever put assets in your own name,\u201d Endresz says cheerfully.\n\nWhile he insists that a loss for Alligator Blood in the Guineas won\u2019t derail a promising career, Endresz acknowledges having backed the horse at odds of 200-to-one.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of horses and glory like this.\u201d\n\nAnother punter cheering along with Endresz will be billionaire retailer and horseman Gerry Harvey, who bred Alligator Blood and owns its sire, All Too Hard.\n\nHarvey\u2019s stallion won the Guineas in 2012; if Alligator Blood can win on Saturday it will be All Too Hard\u2019s first group one winner as a sire.", "description": "Twice-declared bankrupt and banned as a director until 2021, Allan Endresz somehow owns one of the top chances in the Caulfield Guineas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4711%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/933761ece53e4a7d59ad3320701cb2af4f99b76c", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
