The recreation is a work of inclusive design, a design paradigm that aims to make objects and spaces accessible to people of diverse levels of ability.\n\nKatzel is legally blind, with partial vision, and this 3D interpretation gives him access to a piece he would otherwise have difficulty appreciating.\n\nHis hands reach the portrait's ears.\n\n\"It's cool how there [are] moments of comedy in this. Like I can feel his ear hair, right now, which brought a smile to my face.\"\n\nTaylor Katzel, a high-partial legally blind individual, experiences a multi-sensory tour for the first time at the Art Gallery of Ontario. 3:28\n\nKatzel has long been interested in the arts, but he wasn't always vision impaired.\n\n\"Growing up, I had full vision. And I was a really artsy kid.\"\n\nAfter high school he went to the Ontario College of Art and Design University. While there, he decided on his path forward: he wanted to be a visual arts teacher.\n\nBut the summer before teacher's college \u2014 while also employed as a graphic designer \u2014 he started having trouble with his vision.\n\nThe physical challenge brought with it an identity crisis.\n\n\"It was particularly hard because I had built this identity as a visual artist. And my way of thinking led me to believe that having vision was a prerequisite to that.\"\n\nRELATED: ARTIST CHALLENGES YOU TO SEE BEAUTY IN ALL BODIES\n\nBut ultimately, he found that wasn't the case at all. His degrading vision forced him to adapt and find new means of artistic expression. His approach and style began to evolve.\n\nWhen he couldn't see the lines for his drawing assignments, he shifted to thick markers.\n\nWhen he was no longer able to use one medium, he'd find another.\n\n\"So maybe I would use something tactile, instead of paints, maybe I would use clay.\"\n\nVision loss gave Katzel new a new perspective on visual art.\n\nStanding in front of the three-dimensional Portrait of Dr. Heinrich Stadelmann, Katzel explained that inclusive design could bring new perspectives to everyone who enjoys art, not just those with disabilities.\n\nTranslating a painting into a sculpture brings a new dimension to the artwork that everyone can explore.\n\n\"By using different mediums and taking the same idea and representing it different ways, it unlocks meaning and it creates a more complete puzzle.\"\n\nThat's why Katzel wants to see more inclusive design brought to the art world: to give access to people with disabilities and to deepen the artistic experience for everyone.", "description": "Visual art was Taylor Katzel\u2019s passion and he wanted to teach art for a career.
