USA TODAY\n\nNo one is happy with the NBA.\n\nAnd in the middle stands Adam Silver, the NBA commissioner who is on the receiving end of criticism from both sides \u2013 mainland China, which is unhappy with Daryl Morey\u2019s pro-Hong Kong tweet, and pro-democracy supporters worldwide.\n\nMainland China wants a stronger rebuke of Houston Rockets general manager Morey, including his dismissal, and pro-democracy supporters are disappointed the NBA didn\u2019t offer stronger support for Morey and essentially kowtowed to communist and authoritarian China in the name of profit.\n\nThe NBA is ensnared in a geopolitical crisis, one that was bound to happen sooner or later. When a company is global and wants to expand its footprint and increase revenue, it sometimes deals with nations with less-than-stellar human rights records.\n\nIt\u2019s up to Silver to navigate the crisis, which has drawn the attention of four presidential candidates (Andrew Yang, Julian Castro, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Elizabeth Warren) and at least five U.S. senators (Chuck Schumer, Ben Sasse, Marco Rubio, Josh Hawley, Ted Cruz), all of whom criticized the NBA for its response.\n\nMultiple Chinese companies including the Chinese Basketball Association, sports apparel brand Li-Ning and Tencent Sports have suspended partnerships with the Rockets and NBA.\n\nOn Monday in Tokyo, Silver told the Kyodo News, \"The economic impact is already clear. There have already been fairly dramatic consequences from that tweet.\"\n\nThe league statement, released Sunday night, said in part Morey\u2019s tweet was regrettable for those whom it offended. On Monday, Silver offered stronger support for Morey.\n\n\u201cI think as a values-based organization that I want to make it clear ... that Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression,\u201d Silver said.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver said Monday from Tokyo he and the league support Daryl Morey's right to free speech. (Photo: Kyle Terada, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nHawley sent a letter to Silver and all 30 NBA teams: \u201cRemember that some things are more important than money. Remember your responsibility. You may not think of your League as an American undertaking, but whatever you think, what you say and do represents America to the world. And for an American organization to help the most brutal of regimes silence dissent in pursuit of profit is appalling.\u201d\n\nHawley also called for the NBA to cancel two preseason games in China this week \"pending a peaceful resolution to the crisis in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets are en route to China for those games and their players and coaches surely will be asked about the crisis. The Nets are now owned by Joseph Tsai, who is a Taiwanese-Canadian businessman. Tsai posted a strong rebuke of the tweet on his Facebook page Monday.\n\nSilver has guided the NBA through turbulent times before, namely the Donald Sterling situation and relocating the All-Star Game from Charlotte over North Carolina\u2019s bathroom bill. He also managed to keep the NBA away from Colin Kaepernick-like protests during the national anthem.\n\nBut this is a global issue that intersects with U.S. values regarding democracy, free speech and foreign policy, and the NBA is walking a tightrope between financial gain and socio-political ideals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a delicate balancing act,\u201d said Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania professor Wiltold Henisz, who specializes in business and socio-political conflict.\n\nThere are many who believe Silver had one right answer and that was to support Morey without trying to appease China which aims to squash dissent at all costs. This situation with the NBA is right out of China\u2019s playbook, and it has worked for China with other companies, too.\n\n\"There are lot of companies afraid to rile up China because of the risk of lost sales,\" Henisz said.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be realistic. The NBA is not leaving billions on the table for shareholders, who include not only owners but players, too. That might be an antiquated view of capitalism, but it still exists even as capitalism changes.\n\n\u201cPeople are expecting companies to be more political than they used to, especially the Millennial generation,\u201d Henisz said. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing body of evidence that customers and employees have the expectation that their company would get out ahead of political issues. The NBA is really stuck. People want them to say something. But no matter what they say, they\u2019re alienating someone.\n\n\u201cChina is using its soft power to affect corporate behavior. We need to have more discourse about that.\u201d\n\nThe NBA and Silver find themselves in the middle of that discourse, and they\u2019ve learned it\u2019s not a pleasant place to be.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt", "description": "The NBA is in a crisis stemming from a pro-Hong Kong tweet and has drawn the rebuke of four presidential candidates and at least five U.S. senators.", "authors": ["Jeff Zillgitt", "Published P.M.
