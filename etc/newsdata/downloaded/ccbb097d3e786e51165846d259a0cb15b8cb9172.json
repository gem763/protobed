The economy in India is growing at its slowest rate in six years.\n\n\"In India, we are going from very high rates of market growth to growth rates in the mid-single digits,\" added Pitkethly.\n\nIn Argentina, another of Unilever's big emerging markets, hyper-inflation has kept shoppers away from stores and led to a 4% drop in volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\nTARGETS HELD FOR NOW\n\nPernod Ricard's CFO Helene de Tissot blamed a softer trade environment for the drop in sales of its spirits such as Chivas in China.\n\nHowever, she said Pernod was still confident of achieving its mid-term sales growth targets in India and China.\n\nNestle, known for KitKat chocolate bars and Maggi noodles, posted 3.7% organic sales growth in the third quarter, in line with expectations, while Unilever reported 2.9% growth, just shy of analysts' estimates.\n\nBoth companies maintained their operating margin and sales targets for the year.\n\nUnilever shares traded up 1.5% at 1345 GMT, while Nestle slipped 2.2%.\n\nPernod said its like-for-like sales rose only 1.3%, down from 10.4% a year ago and below analysts' expectations.\n\nPernod shares fell 4.6%, trimming gains for the year to under 11%. The French company is facing U.S. tariffs as a result of a long-running dispute over aircraft subsidies.\n\nNestle shares have been the better performer over the year to date, gaining 30% as investors warmed to Schneider's strategy. Unilever, under new CEO Alan Jope this year, has seen its share price increase by around 14%.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Additional reporting by Dominique Vidalon in Paris; Editing by Keith Weir and Elaine Hardcastle)", "description": "ZURICH/LONDON (Reuters) - Global consumer goods companies have been banking on emerging markets to drive their growth, so signs on Thursday that sales have come off the boil in the once-booming economies of China and India could set alarm bells ringing.
