She is the first parent to be sentenced among 34 charged in the scheme.\n\nHuffman admitted to paying $15,000 US to boost her older daughter's SAT scores in 2017 with the help of William (Rick) Singer, an admission consultant at the centre of the scheme.\n\nProsecutors have recommended a month in prison, along with supervised release and a $20,000 fine.\n\nLesser penalties, including probation, would mean little to someone with \"a large home in the Hollywood Hills with an infinity pool,\" prosecutors said in a Sept. 6 filing. They added that a large fine would be \"little more than a rounding error\" for someone worth tens of millions of dollars.\n\nHuffman's lawyers say she should get a year of probation, 250 hours of community service and a $20,000 fine. They say that she was only a \"customer\" in the scheme and that, in other cases of academic fraud, only the ringleaders have gone to prison.\n\n'Deep and abiding shame'\n\nThe case is seen as an indicator of what's to come for the other parents charged. Over the next two months, nearly a dozen others are scheduled to be sentenced after pleading guilty.\n\nA total of 15 parents have pleaded guilty, while 19 are fighting the charges.\n\nHours before Huffman's sentencing, a federal judge announced that the size of bribes paid in the case will not necessarily influence the severity of sentences.\n\nThat settled a dispute between prosecutors, who said bigger bribes should lead to sharper penalties, and the court's probation office, which disagreed after concluding that the scheme caused no financial loss.\n\nU.S. District Judge Indira Talwani sided with the probation office but said all factors will be considered in sentencing decisions.\n\nThe amount Huffman paid is relatively low compared with other bribes alleged in the scheme. Some parents are accused of paying up to $500,000 to get their children into elite schools by having them labelled as recruited athletes for sports they didn't even play.\n\nIn a Sept. 4 letter asking for leniency, Huffman said she turned to the scheme because her daughter's low math scores jeopardized her dream of going to college and pursuing a career in acting. She now carries \"a deep and abiding shame,\" she said.\n\nThe couple's daughter was reportedly unaware of the arrangement.\n\nProsecutors countered that Huffman, a Best Actress Academy Award nominee in 2005 for Transamerica, knew the scheme was wrong but chose to participate anyway. They said she wasn't driven by need or desperation, \"but by a sense of entitlement, or at least moral cluelessness.\"\n\nActress Lori Loughlin, front, and husband, clothing designer Mossimo Giannulli, left, depart federal court in Boston on Wednesday, April 3, 2019, after facing charges in a nationwide college admissions bribery scandal.
