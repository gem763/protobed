There\u2019s a party in the streets.\u201d\n\nUruguay has long been considered a bastion of peace and stability in an often turbulent region.\n\nBut security has been declining, with a sharp rise in some violent crimes reported last year.\n\n\u2013 Public safety a key issue \u2013\n\nIn 2018, South America\u2019s second-smallest country registered a record 414 murders, up 45 percent on the year before.\n\nThe alarming hike fueled a debate over proposed constitutional changes meant to improve security.\n\nThose include the creation of a military National Guard, the establishment of life terms for the most serious offenses \u2014 32 years is the current maximum \u2014 and authorizing police to conduct nighttime raids on the homes of suspected drug dealers.\n\nPolls opened at 8:00 am and results are expected at 8:30 pm. The result of the constitutional reforms should be tight.\n\nSecurity has been a major issue as the governing Broad Front seeks a fourth consecutive term.\n\nIn power since 2005, the Front faces a tough test, with voters angered by a stagnant economy, inflation of 7.5 percent and a nine percent unemployment rate.\n\nMartinez led a recent poll with 40 percent.\n\nThat would not be enough for the former Montevideo mayor to avoid a runoff on November 24, though.\n\nFormer senator Luis Lacalle Pou, 46, of the center-right National Party was polling 28 percent, but in an eventual runoff he would likely win backing from historic rivals the Colorado Party, whose candidate is the economist Ernesto Talvi.\n\nAs he cast his vote in Canelones, a city north of Montevideo, Lacalle Pou said he would start preparing for the second round \u201ctomorrow\u201d because \u201cthere\u2019s no time to waste.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Robbed and destroyed\u2019 \u2013\n\nDaniel Segal, a 65-year-old businessman, voted in the same polling station as Martinez but said the time has come for change and ticked Talvi\u2019s box.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the candidate with the most knowledge, the best educated. Here, these people (the Broad Front) robbed us and destroyed the country.\u201d\n\nMartinez had his supporters at the polling station, too.\n\n\u201cI have a conscience, a memory, ethic, moral and human values: that\u2019s why I\u2019m voting for the Broad Front,\u201d said Valentin Puntigliano, 18, a journalism student.\n\n\u201cThe things the Front have said haven\u2019t all helped me directly. But they\u2019ve done many good things for the rest of the population that is suffering the most,\u201d said mother-of-two Lucia Ricci, 34, who works at Montevideo\u2019s town hall.\n\nRunning fourth in the polls was new right-wing party Open Cabildo, headed by former army commander-in-chief Guido Manini Rios.\n\nHe, too, could join a second round alliance against the Front, which commanded an absolute majority in the last three elections.\n\nThe Broad Front is a coalition of leftist movements that in 2005 broke a near monopoly on the presidency shared by the National and Colorado parties since 1830, two years after Uruguayan independence.\n\nVazquez, the Front\u2019s first president, was succeeded by former left-wing guerrilla Jose Mujica, who became a cult figure known as \u201cthe world\u2019s poorest president\u201d \u2014 he gave away most of his salary and drove an old Volkswagen Beetle.\n\nVazquez cannot run for a second consecutive term.\n\nThe next president will take office on March 1, 2020.", "description": "Montevideo (AFP) \u2013 Uruguayans voted Sunday for a successor to leftist President Tabare Vazquez and on constitutional reforms including establishing", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/3eabaa_daniel-martinez-candidate-uruguay-leftist-broad-governing-coalition-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
