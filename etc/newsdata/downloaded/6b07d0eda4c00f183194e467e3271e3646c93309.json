His latest promotion\u2014to a leadership post focusing on counterterrorism\u2014has not previously been reported. A spokesperson for the NSC declined to comment.\n\nThe vast majority of Hill staffers stay studiously out of the news. But Patel drew national attention in early 2018, when Nunes oversaw the production and release of a memo on surveillance of Trump campaign advisor Carter Page. The memo enraged officials at the Justice Department and the FBI, who said that they had no say in its creation and that it unfairly characterized standard intelligence-gathering practices. But it was a watershed moment for the right\u2019s critics of the Mueller probe and of senior DOJ leadership.\n\nThe memo was part of a broader effort from Nunes to investigate the origins of the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence probe into the Kremlin and the Trump campaign\u2014the project that then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller took over. Nunes\u2019 investigation-of-the-investigators picked up steam as the public\u2019s understanding of Russia\u2019s 2016 interference skyrocketed. Many saw the effort as a way to run interference for the Trump administration, and Nunes\u2019 decision to make a late-night visit to the White House early in the process only raised suspicions.\n\nBut in other quarters, Nunes became a folk hero. And so did Patel. Carter Page, the Trump foreign policy advisor whose Russia links concerned the Intelligence Community, tweeted Patel\u2019s praises when news broke months ago of his departure from the Hill.\n\nPatel also sparred with Rod Rosenstein during his time supervising the Russia probe. In emails that Fox News obtained, Patel wrote that Rosenstein threatened to subpoena the committee\u2019s emails and records. And on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show, Fox contributor Sara Carter said Rosenstein issued \u201cdirect threats\u201d to Patel, in an effort \u201cto keep these people quiet, to keep the American people from hearing the truth.\u201d But Rosenstein denied under oath that he threatened committee staff, and the issue faded.\n\nThe alums of the Russia saga have, mostly, moved on. Rosenstein stepped down from the DOJ and returned to private life. Nunes lost his post as chairman when Democrats flipped the House. Mueller, after marathon Congressional testimony , returned to civilian life. And now Patel has moved from countering the Deep State to counterterrorism.", "description": "Patel was one of the leading staffers pushing back against FBI investigations of Trump-Russia.
