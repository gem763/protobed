He was believed to be 48.\n\n\"He didn't die a hero, he died a coward, crying, whimpering and screaming,\" Trump said at the White House, adding that the U.S. had al-Baghdadi under surveillance for weeks.\n\nMilitants under his command were some of the first jihadis to grow up with the internet, and they deftly exploited social media to tout their military successes, document their mass slaughter, beheadings and stonings, and promote the Islamic State to a global audience.\n\nThe announcement of his death came nearly two years after Iraq announced the defeat of IS and five years after the group humiliated its armed forces and seized nearly a third of the country.\n\nIn April, U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces in Syria declared the group's territorial defeat after liberating the village of Baghouz in eastern Syria, its last bastion. The Islamic State saw its territory shrink from an area the size of Britain to a speck in the Euphrates River valley.\n\nThough at minimum a symbolic victory for Western counterterrorism efforts, it is unclear what impact his death will have on possible future attacks. He was largely regarded as a figurehead of the global terror network, and was described as \"irrelevant for a long time\" by a coalition spokesman in 2017.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said the death of al-Baghdadi is \"only a step,\" adding that the fight continues \"so that the terrorist organization is definitely defeated.\"\n\nAlso unclear is who will replace him as leader. The group has lost many of its senior commanders in U.S.-led airstrikes, including Fadhil Ahmad al-Hayali, described as the group's No. 2 who was killed in Iraq by an August 2015 U.S. airstrike, and Abu Ali al-Anbari, the extremist group's leading finance official, who was killed in 2016. Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, the IS spokesman and one of the group's best-known commanders, also was reported to have been killed in 2016 by a Russian airstrike.\n\nAl-Baghdadi was born as Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai sometime in 1971 in Samarra, Iraq, about 95 kilometers (60 miles) north of Baghdad, according to a U.N. sanctions list. His hometown later would be the site of a 2006 bombing by Sunni militants on a revered Shiite shrine \u2014 an attack that sparked a wave of sectarian violence that pushed Iraq to the brink of civil war.\n\nDetails of his early life are murky. A brief biography posted to online jihadi forums in 2014 traced his lineage to the Prophet Muhammad's Quraysh tribe. Its claims, which cannot be independently confirmed, describe al-Baghdadi as coming from a religious family and earning a doctorate from Saddam University for Islamic Studies, the Iraqi capital's main center at the time for Sunni clerical scholarship. It says he promoted the Salafi jihadi movement, which advocates \"holy war\" to bring about a strict, uncompromising version of Islamic law, or Shariah.\n\nAccording to IS-affiliated websites, al-Baghdadi was detained by U.S. forces in Iraq and sent to Bucca prison in 2004 for his anti-U.S. militant activities, although he was considered a civilian detainee and his jailers were unaware of his jihadi role. He was released 10 months later and joined the al-Qaida branch in Iraq of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.\n\nAl-Zarqawi was killed by a U.S. airstrike north of Baghdad in 2006 and al-Baghdadi became a trusted aide of its two most senior figures, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi and Abu Ayyub al-Masri. Al-Baghdadi assumed control of the group, known at the time as the Islamic State of Iraq.", "description": "Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi sought to establish a new Islamic \"caliphate\" across Syria and Iraq, but he might be remembered more as the ruthlessly calculating militant leader of the Islamic State group who brought terror to the heart of Europe and set up a short-lived organization so extreme that", "authors": ["Adam Schreck", "Zeina Karam"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Pt5m5k5q5SSgybwX6mYADw--~B/aD0xMDAzO3c9MTAwNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/5d283a1e0932188b7c19c1d40f10b0ba", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
