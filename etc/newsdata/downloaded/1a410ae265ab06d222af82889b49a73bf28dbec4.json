E*Trade Financial Corp. dropped 16 per cent, the most in more than a decade. Shares of Interactive Brokers Group Inc. and Schwab both slid more than 9 per cent.\n\nThe move escalates a long-simmering price war as investors gravitate toward the cheapest products, with Interactive Brokers announcing just last week that it would provide free trades. Since the middle of last year, firms including Fidelity Investments, Vanguard Group and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have eliminated fees and commissions on a range of offerings.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have to follow suit,\u201d Kyle Sanders, an analyst at Edward Jones, said of Schwab\u2019s competitors. \u201cIt\u2019s a commoditized business. When there\u2019s an announcement by one firm, others play catch-up or take a more aggressive strategy.\u201d\n\nSchwab\u2019s online clients will qualify for zero commissions, down from US$4.95 per trade, starting Oct. 7, the firm said in a statement. It will continue to charge a fee of 65 US cents per contract for options trades.\n\nDouble-Whammy\n\nAmeritrade is more exposed than its closest rivals because the company gets more than a third of its revenue from commissions in fees, said David Ritter, a senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a double-whammy for them,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the biggest of the big like Schwab, they\u2019re best able to absorb and monetize in other ways.\u201d\n\nWhile the San Francisco-based company, with about US$3.75 trillion of client assets, gets a majority of its revenue from net interest income, its decision to eliminate commissions comes at a perilous time because of historically low interest rates. Last month, the brokerage said it was cutting 600 jobs, or about 3 per cent of its workforce, citing \u201can increasingly challenging economic environment.\u201d\n\nSchwab\u2019s move also may prompt Ameritrade and E*Trade to reconsider a merger, Ritter said.\n\nSchwab previously doubled its suite of no-commission ETFs in March, bringing its total to more than 500 at the time. BlackRock Inc. iShares products were added to its platform, Schwab ETF OneSource, with 90 funds. Several fund issuers including State Street Global Advisors, Invesco Ltd., WisdomTree Investments Inc., J.P. Morgan Asset Management and Pacific Investment Management Co. also planned to add to their commission-free offerings already on the platform.\n\nThe cut to zero commissions is an inevitable industry trend that Schwab is trying to get ahead of, its Chief Financial Officer Peter Crawford said in a separate statement Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing new firms trying to enter our market \u2014 using zero or low equity commissions as a lever,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cIt has seemed inevitable that commissions would head towards zero, so why wait.\u201d\n\nRobo-Advice\n\nThe company last cut its retail trading commissions to US$4.95 from US$6.95 in February 2017, matching cuts by Fidelity. Since then, assets at the firm have grown by about US$800 billion from a combination of market gains and net new inflows.\n\nThe brokerage can make up for lost revenue by offering advice to clients approaching retirement, said Alois Pirker, Aite Group\u2019s research director for wealth management.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking at their client base and saying, \u2018what do our clients need right now?\u2019 They need advice and they need portfolios,\u201d Pirker said.\n\nSchwab has a range of advice offerings, from a free basic robo-advice platform to dedicated financial advisers, whose fees can start at 0.8 per cent of assets per year.\n\nFor Schwab, offering free trades is the ultimate extension of its roots in the 1970s as a discount broker.\n\n\u201cEliminating commissions ensures my ultimate vision is realized \u2014 making investing accessible to all,\u201d Schwab\u2019s billionaire founder and Chairman Charles Schwab said in the statement.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "TD Ameritrade took the biggest hit, tumbling 26 per cent, the most since 1999", "authors": ["John Gittelsohn", "Annie Massa", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/schwab.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
