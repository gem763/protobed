Follow the cyber team, Maggie Miller (@magmill95), and the tech team, Emily Birnbaum (@birnbaum_e) and Chris Mills Rodrigo (@chrisismills).\n\nREAD ALL ABOUT IT: Facebook on Friday announced the launch of a news tab for the platform, which will aggregate and highlight the top stories of the day.\n\nThe launch of the \"news tab\" comes as Facebook faces intense heat over whether its dominance in digital advertising has stifled the ability for newsrooms across the country to grow and retain readers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Today we're starting to test Facebook News, a dedicated place for news on Facebook, to a subset of people in the US,\" said news product manager Mona Sarantakos and vice president of global news partnerships Campbell Brown in a statement.\n\n\"News gives people more control over the stories they see, and the ability to explore a wider range of their news interests, directly within the Facebook app,\" they added.\n\nFacebook News will feature top stories curated by a team of reporters. It will also personalize the selection of stories for users based on news they interact with while using the feature so that people can easily find stories focused on business, entertainment, health and other subjects.\n\nUsers will also be allowed to link their paid news subscriptions and hide articles, topics and publishers they don't want to see.\n\nIn a New York Times op-ed published Friday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Mark Elliot ZuckerbergHillicon Valley: Senators seek national security review of TikTok | TikTok denies claims of Chinese government influence | CNN chief rips Facebook policy on political ads | Dem questions DHS' handling of personal data TikTok denies allegations of Chinese government influence CNN president calls out Facebook over 'absolutely ludicrous' policy on political ads MORE acknowledged \"the internet disrupted the business model for much of the news industry.\"\n\n\"This model establishes a long-term financial partnership between publishers and Facebook for the first time,\" Zuckerberg wrote.\n\nRead more here.\n\nSENATE PASSES DEEPFAKES BILL: The Senate on Thursday passed bipartisan legislation intended to help further understand the risks posed by \"deepfake\" videos, or those altered by artificial intelligence to change the meaning of the video.\n\nThe Deepfake Report Act would require the Department of Homeland Security to publish an annual report on the use of deepfake technology that would be required to include an assessment of how both foreign governments and domestic groups are using deepfakes to harm national security.\n\nThe bipartisan bill was passed by unanimous consent and now heads to the House for consideration. A bipartisan companion bill in that chamber is awaiting markup in the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nThe Senate version is sponsored by Sens.

Elijah Cummings to lie in state in Capitol Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian presses Congress for paid paternity leave Turkey says soldier killed despite cease-fire in Syria MORE (D-N.Y.) outlined his vision for boosting the number of electric vehicles on the road, hoping the U.S. will have an all-electric fleet by 2040.\n\nIn a Thursday op-ed in The New York Times, Schumer outlined his plan, offering steep discounts for buyers that trade in a gas-powered car for an electric one. The assistance would be even greater for low-income customers.\n\n\"Isn't the transition to electric vehicles already happening?\" Schumer wrote. \"Yes, but it is progressing too slowly. Transportation still accounts for nearly one-third of America's carbon output. Even though many American automakers are preparing for an all-electric future, electric vehicles are still too expensive for too many Americans, and our country lacks sufficient battery-charging infrastructure.\"\n\nHis plan also calls for grants to help states build charging stations across the country, with a focus on low-income and rural areas.\n\nWhile Schumer doesn't spell out what form the assistance for electric vehicle purchases would take, the article does say it would only apply to American-made cars. He estimates that assistance along with the investment in charging stations and a program to help automakers shift their factories, would require $454 billion over 10 years.\n\nTransportation is the largest sector of carbon pollution in the U.S., according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency, surpassing greenhouse gas emissions from both power plants and industry.\n\nRead more here.\n\nSTEP RIGHT UP OHIO: Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) on Friday signed into law legislation that will increase cyber protections for election systems and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of the state.\n\nThe legislation, which had bipartisan support, requires post-election audits by county boards of elections to ensure the accuracy of the vote count, while also creating a \"civilian cyber security reserve\" that can be called into duty to protect state and local government entities against cyberattacks, including those involving elections and those against critical infrastructure\n\nThe bill gives the Ohio secretary of state a seat on the Ohio Homeland Security Advisory Council and creates a chief information security officer position within the secretary of state's office to increase attention on election security issues.\n\nOhio Secretary of State Frank LaRose (R), the top election official in the state, said in a statement on Friday that the legislation will give local officials \"the support they need\" to combat foreign cyber threats.\n\n\"Imagine looking out the window and seeing foreign paratroopers parachuting into your town,\" LaRose said. \"We wouldn't tell a community, 'you're on your own \u2013 your sheriff department can fight off that threat.' Well likewise, in the online world, we can now respond with Ohio's best cyber warriors so these counties and cities have the support they need.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nGET SMART: Rep.

The researchers uploaded malicious software to the smart speakers, successfully getting them to obtain recordings.\n\nThere is no evidence that the vulnerability has been exploited by real-world hackers.\n\nAmazon and Google did not immediately respond to The Hill's request for comment.\n\nRead more here.\n\nA LIGHTER CLICK: \"Tweet from staff\"\n\nAN OP-ED TO CHEW ON: Congress must confront online extremism\n\nNOTABLE LINKS FROM AROUND THE WEB:\n\nRep.
