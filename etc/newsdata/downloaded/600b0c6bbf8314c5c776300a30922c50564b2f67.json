But they [the producers] still wanted me on there and I was given an option to use somebody I didn\u2019t know.\n\nJames told metro.co.uk he would be keen to meet the real Sammie, adding that he doesn\u2019t \u2018think there are any single mums that dislike what I\u2019ve done or disliked me, they understand\u2019.\n\nJames almost based the character on someone he knew (Picture: PA)\n\nHaving been branded \u2018a very naughty boy\u2019 by Tim after they learned the truth about his identity, James explained to the others why he played as \u2018Sammie\u2019 and not as himself.\n\n\u2018The reason I went as a single mum is, I thought, \u201cWho do I adore more than anyone in the world?\u201d and it\u2019s my mum. She raised me on my own.\n\n\u2018I did it for all the right reasons. If my mum never had to worry about another bill, that\u2019s everything to me.\n\nWho won The Circle final?\n\nSorry, this video isn't available any more.\n\nThe final was won by Paddy Smyth, who nabbed a \u00a370,000 prize after being voted the most popular contestant by his fellow players.\n\nHowever the public vote was won by Tim, who went home \u00a330,000 richer after proving the viewers\u2019 favourite.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
