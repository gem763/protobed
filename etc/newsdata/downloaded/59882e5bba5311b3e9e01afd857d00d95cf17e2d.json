England Women's World Cup squad rankings 1/24 Karen Bardsley - 7 out of 10 Uncomfortable playing out of the back on occasions but did the basics well when called upon. Missed in the semi-final. Getty Images 2/24 Carly Telford - 6 out of 10 Stepped in for Bardsley on three occasions. Did not disgrace herself, though positioning and decision-making could be questioned on both United States goals. Getty Images 3/24 Mary Earps - N/A Unused third-choice goalkeeper, though will hopefully have benefitted from the experience of travelling to a tournament. Getty Images 4/24 Lucy Bronze - 8.5 out of 10 England\u2019s best all-round player enjoyed an excellent tournament, only to blemish her record with a muted display in the semi-final. Getty Images 5/24 Rachel Daly - 7.5 out of 10 Impressive against Japan, showcasing the depth at Neville\u2019s disposal, but failed to trouble the United States when called upon again in the last four. Getty Images 6/24 Alex Greenwood - 6 out of 10 Started well. Never afraid to offer her winger support on the overlap, winning the penalty against Argentina, though her levels dropped for then onwards. Getty Images 7/24 Demi Stokes - 6 out of 10 Always felt more defensively reliable than Greenwood, but overwhelmed when trying to contain Tobin Heath and Rose Lavelle down her side against the United States. Getty Images 8/24 Steph Houghton - 8 out of 10 The missed penalty will be long remembered, but the England captain was so often making a crucial block or last-ditch tackle at this tournament. Covered for clear defensive frailties. Getty Images 9/24 Millie Bright - 5 out of 10 Another member of Neville\u2019s first-choice defence that never appeared truly comfortable playing out from the back. Had to be carried through by Houghton at times. Getty Images 10/24 Abbie McManus - 6 out of 10 One of several players that was arguably not used enough, especially given Bright\u2019s struggles, though did not cover herself in glory against Sweden. Getty Images 11/24 Leah Williamson - N/A Only appeared once, as a late substitute with the game already won against Cameroon. Getty Images 12/24 Jill Scott - 7.5 out of 10 13 years on from her debut, still England\u2019s best central midfielder. Without her physical presence, the semi-finals would have been a long shot. Will she still be around in 2023? Getty Images 13/24 Keira Walsh - 6 out of 10 Too easily overran and failed to dictate the play for too much of the tournament, though redeemed herself in the semi-final. Getty Images 14/24 Jade Moore - 5.5 out of 10 Supposedly a more combative and conservative presence than Walsh, though England\u2019s midfield did not look any more stable with her in it. Getty Images 15/24 Fran Kirby - 6 out of 10 Finally came to life in the third-place playoff. Of course, by then, it was too late to salvage a disappointing individual tournament for one of England\u2019s most naturally-gifted players. Getty Images 16/24 Georgia Stanway - 7.5 out of 10 Excellent on her only start, against Japan. Bringing her on in the 89th minute of the semi-final summed up Neville\u2019s insufficient use of her at this World Cup. Getty Images 17/24 Karen Carney - 7 out of 10 Made a telling impact from the substitutes\u2019 bench against Japan. Another who Neville may look back and feel he did not use enough, but has now hung up her boots. Getty Images 18/24 Lucy Staniforth - N/A Like Williamson, her only appearance was as a late substitute against Cameroon. Getty Images 19/24 Nikita Parris - 6.5 out of 10 Began brilliantly against Scotland, lively against Norway, but everything either side of those two games was a little underwhelming for the FWA\u2019s Player of the Year. Getty Images 20/24 Beth Mead - 7.5 out of 10 Caught the eye in glimpses. Assists against Argentina and the United States stand out. A fiftful presence, but one that should have been trusted more. Getty Images 21/24 Toni Duggan - 5 out of 10 Picked up an injury at the start of the tournament and looked off-the-pace in the appearances that followed. Dropped for the semi-final and could have few complaints. Getty Images 22/24 Ellen White - 9 out of 10 Brilliant. Tirelessly led the England press off the ball. On it, she made every touch count. Six goals to her name, but sadly no Golden Boot. Getty Images 23/24 Jodie Taylor - 6 out of 10 White\u2019s form left Taylor sidelined, though she delivered a crucial winning goal when called upon against Argentina. Getty Images 24/24 Phil Neville - 6 out of 10 Introduction of a more progressive style is a positive, but work still to do. Selections and in-game decision-making left much to be desired. Has unquestionably built a strong team spirit. Getty 1/24 Karen Bardsley - 7 out of 10 Uncomfortable playing out of the back on occasions but did the basics well when called upon.
