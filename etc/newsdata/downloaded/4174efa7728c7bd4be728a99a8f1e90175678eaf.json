Too many refused to compromise.\n\nThis cannot happen again.\n\nWe must work together, across the House, to find a sensible way forward and bring the country together.", "description": "Writing exclusively for the Mirror, the Shadow Chancellor expresses his fear of an erosion of the rights of ordinary people and vows to give the people the final say", "authors": ["John Mcdonnell", "Image", "Philip Coburn", "Reuters", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20668723.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_British-lawmakers-meet-after-a-EU-summit-to-debate-and-vote-on-the-Brexit-deal-in-London.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
