Elijah Cummings of Maryland. He died early Thursday at age 68. (Oct. 17) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 With the passing of a congressional giant, a cease-fire between Turkey and Syria, and new quid quo pro talk from the White House, the nation's capital was buzzing with news that will have a lasting impact on American politics.\n\nBut the rapid-fire of news that came today, including the latest resignation of a Trump cabinet member, could have proven too much to keep track of.\n\nWith that in mind, here\u2019s a round-up of six of the biggest stories from today:\n\nA congressional legend passed away\n\nRep. Elijah E. Cummings died early Thursday at age 68 from \"complications concerning longstanding health challenges.\"\n\nHe was the son of sharecroppers who went on to become a lawyer, judge, and congressman. He had served on Capitol Hill since 1996 and was a former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nCummings was outspoken on civil rights and voter access, a passionate promoter of Democratic policies and a fierce critic of the Trump administration. But, Cummings was also noted for his fair and respectful treatment of his Republican counterparts.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement that, \"In the House, Elijah was our North Star. He was a leader of towering character and integrity, whose stirring voice and steadfast values pushed the Congress and country to rise always to a higher purpose.\"\n\nCummings was currently serving as the Chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee and played a central figure in the House's ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\n\nCummings in photos: Maryland congressman Elijah Cummings dies at 68\n\nHe and the President had a tiff over the summer after the congressman criticized the administration's handling of migrant detention centers, and his committee authorized subpoenas for senior White House officials' electronic communications. The president called Cummings a \"brutal bully\" and said Baltimore, which Cummings represented, was a \"rodent-infested mess.\"\n\nMore: How Elijah Cummings' unexpected death could affect the impeachment inquiry\n\nMore: 'Enough is enough': The moments that defined the career of Rep. Elijah Cummings\n\nWhite House touts cease-fire between Turkey and Syria\n\nCLOSE Vice President Mike Pence announced Thursday that Turkey has agreed to a cease-fire to allow the Kurdish forces it was battling to safely withdraw from an area in northern Syria. (Oct. 17) AP, AP\n\nVice President Mike Pence announced Thursday that Turkey agreed to halt its military assault in Syria for five days in a U.S.-brokered cease-fire that will allow Kurdish forces to withdraw.\n\n\"It will be a pause in military operations for 120 hours,\" Pence told reporters at a news conference after a four-hour meeting with Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in the country.\n\nU.S. troops continue to withdraw from Syria after Trump's announcement. Some lawmakers and foreign policy experts say the cease-fire announcement has caused confusion in Syria and seems unlikely to hold.\n\nTurkey's invasion of Syria began shortly after Trump ordered the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the region, causing havoc within the country and putting the Kurds, a US ally, in danger.\n\nTrump touted the deal via tweet just minutes after Pence's announcement, suggesting that his imposition of sanctions pushed Erdogan to reverse course.\n\n\"This deal could NEVER have been made 3 days ago. There needed to be some 'tough' love in order to get it done,\" Trump declared online.\n\nThis deal could NEVER have been made 3 days ago. There needed to be some \u201ctough\u201d love in order to get it done. Great for everybody. Proud of all! \u2014 Donald J.

Rick has done a fantastic job. But it was time,\" Trump told reporters, adding that Perry will stay on until the end of the year.\n\nPerry is one of Trump\u2019s longest-serving Cabinet secretaries and was a member of Trump's original cabinet.\n\nHe was subpoenaed last week in the inquiry and is facing a Friday deadline to comply with the congressional subpoenas. House Democrats had demanded he turn over documents related to Trump's call with Zelensky.\n\nSondland breaks with Trump in testimony\n\nDuring testimony before the House impeachment panel investigating President Donald Trump on Thursday, Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, told lawmakers he was disappointed that he had to consult with the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on Ukraine policy.\n\n\"It was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the president's mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani,\" Sondland said. \"Our view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the president's personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine.\"\n\nPelosi declared a formal impeachment inquiry Sept. 24 after reports about a July phone call where Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate one of his political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nSondland's deposition under subpoena comes more than a week after the State Department blocked his voluntary appearance before the panels. Trump tweeted that he didn\u2019t want Sondland to go before a \u201ckangaroo court.\u201d\n\n\"I did not understand, until much later, that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the President\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign,\" his remarks state.\n\nMore: House Republicans complain about limited access to closed-door House impeachment investigation sessions\n\nMore: Part attorney, part investigator. How Rudy Giuliani's many roles for Trump could play out in impeachment inquiry\n\nMulvaney alludes to quid pro quo\n\nThe acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney acknowledged Thursday that financial aid to Ukraine at the center of the House impeachment inquiry was withheld because of the president's desire for the country to engage in U.S. politics.\n\nDuring a rare White House press briefing, Mulvaney told reporters, \"Did he also mention to me in passing the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s it,\" Mulvaney said. \"That\u2019s why we held up the money,\" acknowledging that the White House did, in fact, freeze nearly $400 million in US security aid to Ukraine over Trump's desire to push Ukraine to investigate \"corruption\" related to a conspiracy theory involving the hacking of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer server.\n\nThese comments undercut GOP lawmakers and Trump's assertion that aid was not withheld in exchange for Ukraine's help in looking into political foes.\n\n\u201cI have news for everybody: get over it. There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy,\u201d Mulvaney stated.\n\nMulvaney denied that withholding the aid was linked to the Bidens, though Trump explicitly asked Ukrainian President Zelensky to investigate them during the July 25 phone call.\n\nLeaving a closed hearing, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Mulvaney\u2019s acknowledgment of a quid pro quo \"certainly indicates that things have gone from very very bad to much much worse.\"\n\nMulvaney released a statement later Thursday trying to clarify the comments.\n\nMore: Trump's conspiracy theories thrive in Ukraine, where a young democracy battles corruption and distrust\n\n2020 G-7 to be held at Trump resort\n\nThe White House announced Thursday that Trump will host world leaders at a G-7 economic summit in 2020 at his Doral golf resort in Miami.\n\nDemocrats and other critics of Trump denounced the decision as nothing more than self-dealing, involving the nation's foreign policy.\n\nHouse Democrats said that they will try to make Doral an issue as part of a congressional debate on government spending. The House Appropriations Committee said two provisions in a spending bill would \u201cprevent the President from spending federal funds at Trump properties.\u201d\n\nHosting the G-7 summit at Doral violates the Constitutional prohibition of emoluments, critics have said, calling it \"perhaps the first publicly known instance in which foreign governments would be required to pay President Trump\u2019s private businesses in order to conduct business with the United States.\"\n\nMore: Behind-the-scenes discord rattles G-7 summit despite Donald Trump's claim that all is well\n\nContributing: William Cummings, David Jackson, John Fritze, Bart Jansen, Deirdre Shesgreen, Courtney Subramanian, Nicholas Wu, and Kim Hjelmgaard.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/17/elijah-cummings-mick-mulvaney-political-news-today/4013055002/", "description": "With the passing of a Capitol Hill giant, a cease-fire between Turkey and Syria, and an admitted quid quo pro, Washington was rocked by news Thursday.", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
