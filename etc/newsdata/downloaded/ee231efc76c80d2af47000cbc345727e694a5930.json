But some Swedes think it sent the wrong signal to the bad guys.\n\nThe clip published on the police department\u2019s Facebook page last Sunday shows a patroller named Martin performing a humorous equestrian jumping routine in Gottsunda, the area in his charge.\n\n\u201cIf there is rain on Monday morning, maybe this video will cheer you up,\u201d the description says, adding that building trust with local residents and workers is essential for successful policing.\n\nThere were, of course, quite a few positive comments, which said it was nice to see officers befriending children and having a good time.\n\n\u201cI fully respect the police and think it\u2019s absolutely fantastic when they show they are human under the uniform,\u201d a comment read. But some people had a less welcoming attitude.\n\n\u201cWhen bad guys see this they will surely drop their weapons and surrender,\u201d one person wrote. She suggested having \u201cbig and scary\u201d cops could be a good idea for Sweden.\n\nAlso on rt.com At least 19 cars burned, barber shop rocked by EXPLOSION in Stockholm suburb\n\nAnother wondered what this monkey business was supposed to achieve for the police.\n\n\u201cThe word of the day today is \u2018embarrassment\u2019,\u201d the commenter said.\n\n\u201cGreat to see the police are playing games while Sweden burns,\u201d another person fumed.\n\nJudging by the number of \u2018like\u2019 emojis, those criticisms got a lot of public support.\n\nThe complaints may have something to do with the fact that Gottsunda is one of 22 areas in Sweden and the only in Uppsala designated as \u201cespecially vulnerable\u201d by the police.\n\nAlso on rt.com 8 more areas in Sweden added to list of so-called 'no-go zones\u2019\n\nAlso dubbed \u201cno-go zones\u201d by some media, they are the ones where high crime rates, mistrust in official institutions and extremism are especially high.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not that crime problems are limited to those 22 neighborhoods. Just last week 19 cars were damaged in the northern Stockholm suburb of Marsta after an explosive device went off in front of a barber shop early in the morning.\n\nLike this story?
