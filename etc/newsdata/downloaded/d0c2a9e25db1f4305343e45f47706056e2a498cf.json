REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - The British government is discussing the timing of a Queen\u2019s Speech with parliamentary authorities, the leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said on Thursday.\n\nThe government had planned to have a Queen\u2019s Speech, which starts a new parliamentary session and sets out the government\u2019s plans for upcoming legislation, on Oct. 14 and had suspended parliament ahead of that.\n\nBut earlier this week the Supreme Court ruled that the decision to suspend, or prorogue, parliament for five weeks rather than the usual few days was unlawful and parliament resumed.\n\n\u201cThat is being discussed,\u201d Rees-Mogg told lawmakers when asked about the timing of the Queen\u2019s Speech, adding that the government would make sure any prorogation \u201cmeets the requirements of the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment.\u201d\n\nRees-Mogg also said that opposition lawmakers could have a vote of no-confidence in the government on any day next week they wanted. That could trigger an election, which the government is seeking but which opposition parties have so far rejected.", "description": "The British government is discussing the timing of a Queen's Speech with parliamentary authorities, the leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434159280&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P17L", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
