However, that fell short of analyst expectations of a near 11 per cent jump.\n\nInvestors were also put out by Dunelm's admission that its performance in September was mixed as the UK's \u00a313billion homewares market was knocked by the ongoing Brexit uncertainty and weak consumer confidence.\n\nDunelm shares closed down 10% at \u00a37.30 following its trading update\n\nBut the company shrugged it off. 'We are pleased with our performance in the first quarter, building on the strong growth delivered over the last year,' said Dunelm boss Nick Wilkinson.\n\n'Despite the recent softness in the homewares market and the increased political uncertainty, we are confident we can continue to win market share and our expectations for the full year remain unchanged,' he thundered.\n\nIts comes after furniture firms DFS and ScS reported a slowdown in recent sales as shoppers hold off from making big purchases as the Brexit deadline approaches.\n\nDunelm was founded in 1979 as a market stall business selling ready-made curtains. Its first shop opened in Leicester in 1984.\n\nNow with 170 shops, Dunelm is in the process of launching a new website as it looks to drive the fast-growing digital side of the business.\n\nDunelm was founded in 1979 as a market stall business selling ready-made curtains\n\nCommenting on the drop in shares, Steve Miley from Ask Traders says: 'Expectations for sales were in the region of 11 per cent, so the increase reported is a little disappointing.\n\n'After a strong end to the previous year, expectations were riding high. Brexit uncertainty, consumers reining in spending and shopping habits changing are challenges which appear to be starting to catch up with the homeware retailer.'\n\nDunelm has seemingly defied the gloom in the retail sector over the past year with a string of positive results. In its previous quarter, sales grew by more than 10 per cent.\n\nRuss Mould from AJ Bell said today's sales numbers 'would still be the envy of many retailers, but arguably not enough to sustain the excitement behind the Dunelm story'.\n\nDunelm shares closed down 10.4 per cent at \u00a37.30.", "description": "In a trading update, the firm said sales grew by more than 6 per cent in the past three months.
