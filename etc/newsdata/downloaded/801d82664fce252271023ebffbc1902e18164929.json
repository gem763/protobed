We might have one after the game.\u201d\n\nGatland changed nine players from their bruising defeat to South Africa as they get ready to take on the 1987, 2011 and 2015 champions in Tokyo on Friday.\n\nEngland beat New Zealand in the semis after forming a V shape to challenge their haka, but Gatland said he hadn\u2019t made any plans for the pre-match ritual.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t even spoken about the haka. We might do a \u2018W\u2019 for Wales. It hasn\u2019t really crossed my mind,\u201d said the New Zealander, who is stepping down after the game.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Wales coach Warren Gatland joked Wednesday that a drinking game should settle third place at the Rugby World Cup as he prepares his", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/fdd064_wales-coach-warren-gatland-joked-rugby-world-cup-place-play-off-settled-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
