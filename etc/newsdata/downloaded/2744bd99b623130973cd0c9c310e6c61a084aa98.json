The fate of a new set of 15 percent tariffs scheduled to go into effect on $156 billion of Chinese imports in mid-December remained unclear.\n\nChina agreed to buy $40 to $50 billion in agricultural products, relieving pressure on farmers, a key constituency that has suffered under the ongoing trade war.\n\nWhat we don't know: Can the U.S. and China follow through? The deal must still be written and signed by both parties. It also steers clear of broader issues Trump hoped to address when he embarked on the trade war last year, including broader intellectual property issues, forced technology transfer and massive Chinese industrial subsidies.\n\nThe timeline:\n\nTrump said the initial deal would be written over the next three weeks.\n\nTrump suggested he could sign the deal next month when he and Chinese President Xi Jinping will be in Chile for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings.\n\nNegotiations on a second phase, he said, would continue after the signing of the first phase.\n\nThere were hints earlier in the day...: Trump sought to project optimism about the progress of trade discussions with China earlier Friday, saying there are \"warmer feelings\" than in past meetings.\n\n\"Good things are happening at China Trade Talk Meeting,\" Trump tweeted Friday morning.\n\nStock markets jumped Friday morning ahead of Trump's meeting with Lieu He. Markets later dipped slightly upon news of the limited agreement.\n\nThe big picture: Friday's agreement marked a turnaround in the negotiations after months of discord and escalating tariffs. Trade experts had been pessimistic that the discussions would lead to a comprehensive agreement and warned that the longer the trade war went on without a resolution, the harder it would become to actually broker a deal.\n\nLEADING THE DAY\n\nTrump expands authority to sanction Turkey: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinOn The Money: Trump to meet China's vice premier during trade talks | Appeals court says Deutsche Bank doesn't have Trump's tax returns | House Appropriations Chair Nita Lowey to retire Trump says he will meet with Chinese vice premier Friday amid trade talks The Hill's Morning Report - Trump grapples with Syria fallout MORE on Friday announced that President Trump will sign an executive order expanding the administration's ability to impose sanctions on Turkish officials as the president faces growing criticism over his decision to pull U.S. forces out of northern Syria.\n\nWhat we know: Mnuchin said that the executive order does not itself contain new sanctions, but gives Trump the authority to enact them. The new powers will allow the Treasury Department to sanction individuals and entities in Ankara involved in human rights abuses or undermining security in northern Syria.\n\nTough words from Mnuchin: \"The president is concerned about the ongoing military offensive and potential targeting of civilians, civilian infrastructure, ethnic and religious minorities, and the president wants to make very clear that it is imperative that Turkey not allow even a single ISIS fighter to escape,\" Mnuchin told reporters at The White House. \"These are very powerful sanctions. We hope that we don't have to use them, but we can shut down the Turkish economy if we need to.\"\n\nThe big picture: Friday's announcement appeared to be an effort from the White House to appease Republicans who have hammered the administration over its handling of the situation in Syria and called for a tough response to Turkey's military movements. Trump has faced intense criticism for his decision to pull U.S. forces out of Syria.\n\nIn Congress: House Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney Elizabeth (Liz) Lynn CheneyOvernight Defense: Trump tries to defend stance on Kurds | Biden says Trump sold out allies | McMaster criticizes Trump's Syria decision | Latest on arrest of Giuliani associates Cheney slated to introduce bill to place sanctions on Turkey GOP lawmaker after Syria decision: 'Pull my name off the \"I support Donald Trump\" list' MORE (R-Wyo.) plans to introduce sanctions legislation in the coming days, and Sens.

Circuit ruled that the subpoena, issued by the Democratic-led House Oversight and Reform Committee, is \"valid and enforceable.\"\n\nThe ruling is a major victory for House Democrats as they investigate Trump's finances amid a broader impeachment inquiry. The Hill's Naomi Jagoda explains why here.\n\nThe background:\n\nThe Democratic-led House Oversight and Reform Committee issued a subpoena in April to Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, seeking years' worth of financial records on Trump and several of his business entities.\n\nTrump filed a lawsuit challenging the subpoena, arguing that it lacks a legitimate legislative purpose. A federal district court judge ruled in favor of the Oversight and Reform Committee, and Trump appealed.\n\nThe decision: In the appeals court's majority ruling, the judges said that the Oversight panel was engaged in a \"legitimate legislative investigation\" when it issued the subpoena and that the subpoena seeks information on a subject that could be a focus of legislation.\n\nThe reactions:\n\nWhat comes next: Jay Sekulow Jay Alan SekulowTrump says Gowdy can't join his legal team 'for a couple months' Five things to know about arrest of Giuliani associates Attorney distances Trump campaign from indicted Giuliani associates MORE, a personal lawyer for Trump, said in a statement that the president's team is \"reviewing the opinion and evaluating all options including appeals.\"\n\nON TAP NEXT WEEK\n\nWednesday:\n\nThe House Financial Services Committee holds a hearing on Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) oversight with CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger, 10 a.m.\n\nThe House Budget Committee holds a hearing entitled \"Strengthening Our Fiscal Toolkit: Policy Options to Improve Economic Resiliency,\" 10 a.m.\n\nThe House Small Business Committee holds a hearing on management and performance challenges at the Small Business Administration,\" 11:30 a.m.\n\nThe House Financial Services Committee holds a hearing on renewing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program,\" 2 p.m.\n\nThe Joint Economic Committee holds a hearing on measuring economic inequality in the U.S., 2:15 p.m.\n\nThursday:\n\nThe Senate Banking Committee holds a hearing on Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) oversight with CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger, 10 a.m.\n\nA House Financial Services subcommittee holds a hearing on the effects of stock buybacks, 10 a.m.\n\nA House Small Business subcommittee holds a hearing entitled \"Can Opportunity Zones Address Concerns in the Small Business Economy?\" 10 a.m.\n\nA House Financial Services subcommittee holds a hearing on diversity in the U.S. workforce, 2 p.m.\n\nFriday:\n\nThe House Financial Services Committee task force on financial technology holds a hearing on financial data storage, 9:30 a.m.\n\nGOOD TO KNOW\n\nGeneral Motors officials are urging the United Autoworkers Union (UAW) to agree to around-the-clock negotiations in an attempt to speed the resolution of a nearly month-long strike.\n\nThe co-founder and CEO of Reddit and a top policy official with Google are slated to testify next week before a key House panel about the tech industry's legal protections, the committee announced Friday.\n\nA government task force has reportedly found that Boeing did not sufficiently inform regulators about aspects of a new automated system that contributed to two recent crashes of its 737 Max.\n\nODDS AND ENDS", "description": "Happy Friday and welcome back to On The Money.
