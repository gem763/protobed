Year after year, Diwali festivities, which more often than not, coincide with the onset of winters, cause smog in and around Delhi-NCR.\n\nThis time, in a bid to curb the pollution, the Delhi government has shared an ambitious plan of action.\n\nToday we have announced a 7-point Parali Pradushan Action Plan that involves\n\n1. Odd Even\n\n2. Pollution Masks\n\n3. Community Diwali Laser Show\n\n4. Environment Marshals\n\n5. Hotspot Control\n\n6. Dust Control\n\n7. Tree Challenge\n\nThis is a comprehensive plan to prepare ourselves for smog. \u2014 Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) September 13, 2019\n\nIn a press conference, one the first things the Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal announced is a redux of the odd-even rule.\n\nApart from that he also warned people to stop using crackers and in it's place, he said, a grand laser show will be organised on the eve of Diwali.\n\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal: Odd-Even vehicle scheme to be implemented from 4th to 15th November, 2019. pic.twitter.com/qVmLChGHsd \u2014 ANI (@ANI) September 13, 2019\n\n\"In Diwali, firecrackers cause massive pollution and the smoke gets trapped, as a result of which it becomes difficult to breathe in Delhi,\" Kejriwal said.\n\nAfter the parali season ends, the Winter Action Plan will be implemented.\n\nOther than Odd Even and community Diwali celebration, all other measures will continue throughout the winter season. \u2014 Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) September 13, 2019\n\n\"I appeal to people of Delhi to not burst crackers. Delhi government will organise a laser show on the evening of Chhoti Diwali,\" the CM added.\n\nHere's what people had to say about the laser show idea:\n\n#1\n\nDiwali laser show is a kickass idea ! \u2014 Liberal_Mao_Zedong (@lowqualitybot1) September 13, 2019\n\n#2\n\nWho in ur family runs a laser show business or maybe abt to start one?? \u2014 Aparna Gandotra (@dev_aparna) September 13, 2019\n\n#3\n\n@ArvindKejriwal ji pls plan a massive tree plantation scheme on the outskirts of city every month.... in the next 5-10 years we would see great control over smog and pollutants! Indeed trees are the best machines available on earth to convert CO2, CO and NOx to O2 \u2014 Anuj Dawane\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 (@AnujDawane) September 13, 2019\n\n#4\n\nLaser show is way better than crackers. Kaash k haryana m bhi aisa ho. \u2014 deepak (@tech_update0) September 13, 2019\n\nKejriwal also said that the use of water sprinklers and mechanised sweeping of roads to control dust particles will be their topmost priorities pre- and post-Diwali.\n\nThe Delhi government will start distributing N-95 category mask in large numbers from this October. N95 category mask, a disposable safety device, which covers the nose and mouth, protects the wearer from breathing in small particles in the air such as dust and mold, reports PTI.", "description": "Diwali is just round the corner and concerns over the aftermath of the celebrations have already got officials thinking of plans to combat it.
