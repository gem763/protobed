Here was the first black president of the United States, promising to be a leader for all Americans, to halt the rise of the oceans and to be the most transparent administration ever. Even black Americans were saying the Civil War was finally over.\n\nUnfortunately for America, it didn\u2019t turn out that way. As more and more evidence is revealed daily on the evening news, it is now very clear the Obama administration was the most corrupt presidency in the history of the republic.\n\nAs Mr. Obama\u2019s favorite, President Abraham Lincoln, warned us, the most dangerous threats can come from domestic enemies.\n\nFirst of all, that bit about being a leader for all Americans, color-blind if you will, was a tall tale. Mr. Obama never missed an opportunity to sow racial divide. During his term in the Oval Office, racial relations literally went off the cliff. Mr. Obama and first lady Michelle promoted the false narrative that white America was literally guilty of hunting down blacks with glee. They whipped up resentment in minority communities against the police, even though a Harvard study found that blacks are no more likely to be killed by police than whites.\n\nBut the racial divisions, as painful and heartbreaking as they are, were not the worst of it.\n\nThe abuse of power started to become clear when it was revealed the Internal Revenue Service was biased against conservatives. I still don\u2019t understand why that woman is not in jail. She sat there and lied to the American people and to Congress with no accountability.\n\nMr. Obama used the agencies, and the awesome power of the federal government, against his political enemies. He used the power of the state against those he didn\u2019t like. This was full-on banana republic dictator kind of stuff.\n\nThe negligence at Veterans\u2019 Affairs, the \u201cstimulus bill\u201d that was simply a redistribution to unions (those \u201cshovel ready projects\u201d weren\u2019t so shovel ready after all), the sale of uranium to the Russians, the lies about Benghazi, the Clinton email scandal that was not prosecuted, the appeasement of the Iranians \u2014 even sending billions in cash in the middle of the night and bragging about how they lied to the American press and public, the use of financial penalties to fund leftist causes, the use of the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) to take property from Americans, on, and on, and on. I literally could go on forever.\n\nHowever, the coup-de-grace is what we are now learning about the 2016 election and the criminal spying on the Trump campaign.\n\nThe president of the United States was set up. Mr. Trump is exactly right. The weaponization of our intelligence and security services has damaged their reputation for generations, and the rule of law, to which this great nation is so committed, has been irreparably damaged as well.\n\nI\u2019ve said it before, the Obama administration was nothing more than highly organized crime.\n\nJustice will be served. It may take a while, but the truth will continue to come out.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame the administration of the first black president was also the most corrupt. Such a lost opportunity to better this great country.\n\nIt\u2019s not that hard to understand. Still, it\u2019s difficult to accept.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t happen here.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
