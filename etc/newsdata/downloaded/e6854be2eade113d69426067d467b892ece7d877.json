When cool, the intermodal containers can be stacked on ships and trains and hauled to market. The company just completed its first test shipment of 130 barrels from Edmonton to Prince Rupert, B.C., to China.\n\n\u201cThis is the first shipment \u2014 but Melius is prepared to commercialize today. Currently they are working towards finalizing partnerships with several producers in Canada,\u201d according to an emailed statement on behalf of the company.\n\nNow Melius intends to scale up the technology of its Calgary-based partner BitCrude and develop supply contracts with Asian refineries, Melius president Nicole Zhang says.\n\n\u201cEstablishing a transportation solution for Canadian energy that delivers tremendous value for local producers while satisfying the demand for our energy internationally is our priority,\u201d Zhang, a former pro golfer on the LPGA circuit, said in a statement.\n\nCanadian oil production reached 4.3 million barrels a day a year ago while the takeaway capacity on existing pipelines remained at about 3.9 million barrels a day, according to the Vancouver-based Fraser Institute. The export constraint has fostered a dependence on the U.S. market and depressed prices for Canadian heavy crude that cost producers almost $21 billion last year in lost revenue, the institute says.\n\nAdding to the industry\u2019s woes, the federal Liberal government passed a law earlier this year banning oil tankers from carrying more than 12,500 metric tonnes along the north B.C. coast. Alberta and petroleum producers have attacked the measure as blocking Canadian oil from reaching international markets if a pipeline was built to the area.\n\nMelius contends the BitCrude method of shipping semi-solid bitumen in custom 20-foot containers exceeds safety regulations because it\u2019s designated as a non-dangerous and non-flammable good that\u2019s non-toxic to marine life as the poisonous diluting agents are removed. And the containers of what it calls True Crude float in salt or fresh water making it recoverable if there was an accident, the company says.\n\nAttempts to get Canadian oil to non-U.S. markets have stalled as projects, such as the $7.4-billion Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from Alberta to the B.C. coast, have been hindered by court challenges and provincial trade spats. The expansion is still years away from completion. Likewise, the proposed Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta to Nebraska has been stymied by opposition from environmentalists, Indigenous communities and ranchers concerned by the threat of pipeline spills.\n\nAddressing those concerns, an online video by Melius says its \u201cTrue Crude is the world\u2019s safest oil.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cnot only safe but also economical and efficient,\u201d it adds.\n\nThe BitCrude process was developed by company founder Cal Broder during a decade of research and was partnered with Melius to market the concept, he said in the statement.\n\n\u201cWe have now proven that we can ship bitumen to international markets safely and efficiently,\u201d Broder said.\n\n\u2022 Email: cmcclelland@postmedia.com\n\n", "description": "Melius Energy's process creates bitumen that's non-toxic to marine life and its containers float in water for easy recovery in case of an accident", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/melius.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
