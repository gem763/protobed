We\u2019re not talking about the melt-in-your-mouth-not-in-your-hand confection; we\u2019re talking money and media.\n\nApply to be TC Top Pick at Disrupt Berlin 2019 and \u2014 if you make the cut \u2014 you\u2019ll receive a free Startup Alley Exhibitor Package, the VIP treatment and plenty of exposure to both media and investors.\n\nDon\u2019t wait \u2014 the application deadline is 18 October at 12 p.m. (PT). Apply to be a TC Top Pick right now.\n\nWe\u2019ll get into the details of how to apply in a moment, but here\u2019s an example of why you should apply. Jana Rosenfelder, co-founder of Actijoy, found real value in her Top Pick experience at Disrupt SF 2018.\n\n\u201cBeing a TC Top Pick was a door-opener, because the media paid so much attention. It made a big impression with people who visited our booth. Whenever I mentioned we were a Top Pick, it was like a trigger. It gave us more credibility, and everyone listened to us.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re eligible to apply if your early-stage startup falls into one of the following tech categories: AI/Machine Learning, Biotech/Healthtech, Blockchain, Fintech, Mobility, Privacy/Security, Retail/E-commerce, Robotics/IoT/Hardware, CRM/Enterprise and Education.\n\nTC Top Picks is a competitive process, and TechCrunch editors review the applications looking for interesting startups that show solid potential. They\u2019ll choose up to five startups for each category.\n\nAll TC Top Pick startups receive a free Startup Alley Exhibitor Package, which includes one full day exhibiting in a dedicated space within Startup Alley \u2014 the Disrupt expo floor teeming with opportunity. Your package also includes access to the programming on all stages (including the Startup Battlefield competition), three Founder passes, the complete attendee list (via TC Events Mobile App), the list of attending press, use of the Startup Alley Exhibitor Lounge and CrunchMatch \u2014 our business networking platform.\n\nPlus, a TechCrunch editor will interview each Top Pick live on our Showcase Stage, and we\u2019ll promote that video across our social media platforms, which can help drive traffic to your site. It\u2019s a marketing gift that keeps on giving.\n\nAs if that weren\u2019t enough, you might pull a Legacy. Each exhibiting startup has a shot at being chosen as a Wild Card and competing in the Startup Battlefield. Last year, Legacy earned the Wild Card slot, and then went on to win the Startup Battlefield competition.\n\nDisrupt Berlin 2019 takes place on 11-12 December, and this is your chance to bask in the attention of investors and global media. Apply to be a TC Top Pick before the clock runs out on 18 October at 12 p.m. (PT).\n\nIs your company interested in sponsoring or exhibiting at Disrupt Berlin 2019?
