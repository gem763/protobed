Pence and Bolton have been quietly close, but Pence plays a much more cautious and disciplined game. The New York Times reported Pence\u2019s team was angry that Pence was named in news reports with Bolton as opposing Trump\u2019s plan to invite Taliban leaders to Camp David.\n\n\u201cBoth Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence publicly denied the reports, and some White House officials said they believed it was the last straw for the president,\u201d according to the Times. This is a leak about a leak.\n\nBolton is not innocent: His team just got outgunned, outmaneuvered and out-leaked. It was inevitable. Anticipating this outcome, Bolton had been telling people for months he intended to leave by the end of the year. The Afghanistan Camp David mess seems to have sped that up. Bolton will leave with a record of some policy wins and some losses \u2014 from his perspective, more wins than if he hadn\u2019t had the job at all.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill lost a key interlocutor and a key ally inside the White House. Many fear Trump will replace Bolton with someone who will feed Trump\u2019s own desire to drastically pull back on U.S. commitments and alliances abroad. Even Democrats acknowledge Bolton was somebody who they knew and trusted to \u2014 at the very least \u2014 push back against Trump\u2019s worst instincts or false beliefs.", "description": "", "authors": ["Josh Rogin", "Beta.Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Bolton-Lost-Latest-Trump-Administration-Factional-Battle-Not-Last"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
