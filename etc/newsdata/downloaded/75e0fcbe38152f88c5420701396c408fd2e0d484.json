In March, Norway accused Russia of jamming its GPS systems and interfering in encrypted communications systems.\n\n\"Training outside the U.S. enables aircrew and Airmen to become familiar with other theaters and airspace, and enhances enduring skills and relationships necessary to confront a broad range of global challenges,\" US Air Force spokesman Capt. Christopher Bowyer-Meeder told Insider.\n\nRead More: Stunning photos show US Air Force B-2 stealth bombers training with British F-35 fighters for the first time\n\nThe B-2s are part of the 509th Bomb Wing from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. They are deployed to Royal Air Force Base Fairford near Gloucestershire, England where last month they flew with non-US F-35s for the first time. RAF Fairford is the forward operating location for US Air Force in Europe's bombers.\n\nFour KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft from the 100th Air Refueling Wing stationed at RAF Mildenhall joined the B-2s on the mission over the Norwegian Sea.\n\nA spokesperson from the 509th Bomb Wing told Insider that no other NATO aircraft were involved in the mission, and the bombers did not have any ammunition on board.\n\nLast month, the B-2 also made its very first visit to Iceland, establishing the Air Force's presence in a region Russia considers its dominion. Iceland's Keflavik Air Base was established during the Cold War as a deterrent to the Soviet Union, and the B-2s' brief stopoff there demonstrated its ability to operate in cold-weather conditions.\n\nIn the past year, US forces have completed several missions from the region to deter Russian aggression against NATO allies, including B-52 training near the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia forcibly took in 2014. That aggression kicked off the European Deterrance Initiative to ensure quick reaction to threats and assure NATO allies of the US's commitment to defense.", "description": "Three B-2 Spirit bombers flew over the Arctic for the first time, as a clear show of force to Russia, which considers the Arctic its back yard.", "authors": ["Ellen Ioanes"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7672c02e22af70de44ca76-2560-1280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
