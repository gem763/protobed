But our Vegan Cheeseburger is not cooked in the same place as any meat products.'\n\nThe clever wording of the Rebel Whopper burger initially implied the burger was vegan, but the burger chain can't guarantee the patty didn't come into contact with any animal products.\n\nThe burger chain do have a limited vegan range, including the vegan cheeseburger, and have been quick to make the distinction for confused customers on their social media channels.\n\nWhen one person asked whether the 'new vegan line' was fried in the same oil that cooks the beef and chicken, a Hungry Jacks spokesperson said the company keeps vegan and non-vegan products separate.\n\nThe clever wording of the Rebel Whopper burger initially implied the burger was vegan, but customers have been warned that the burger chain can't guarantee the patty didn't come into contact with any animal products\n\n'Our Rebel Whopper patty is flame-grilled for that smokey, BBQ taste... but our Vegan Cheeseburger is not cooked in the same place as any meat products.\n\n'The Rebel Whopper's patty is made from plants, then flame-grilled. If you would like a Vegan burger not prepared on our broiler, try our delicious Vegan Cheeseburger,' the spokesperson told another potential customer.\n\nDespite Hungry Jack's attempt to clear the confusion, some people say more should have been done to ensure a distinction was made.\n\nPoll Did you think the new 'plant based' burger was vegan?

It is very difficult to tell the difference.'\n\nHe added that the burger is aimed at 'flexitarians' who would welcome the alternative.\n\n'There is a growing number of flexitarians and meat reducers who, while not necessarily vegetarian or vegan, welcome a plant-based option in their diet,' he said.\n\nThe burger is sold for the same price as the regular whopper and is available at all 440 stores around Australia.\n\nDaily Mail Australia has contacted Hungry Jack's for comment.", "description": "The 'made from plants' burger is not vegan as it contains mayonnaise and is grilled on the same grill as the meat at the burger chain's Australian stores.", "authors": ["Brittany Chain", "Sahar Mourad For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/04/19616350-0-image-a-48_1570851871095.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
