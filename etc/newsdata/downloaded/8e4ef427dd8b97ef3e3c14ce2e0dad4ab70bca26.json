Not just any Saturday, either. One of those gorgeous, cobwebs-in-the-dew autumn mornings where any sane human being was slouched on the sofa, mug of something freshly percolated on the go and two enticing rugger matches in the pipeline.\n\nBut no, down some of us trudged to Parliament instead, those most dreaded of words \u2018rail-replacement bus service\u2019 blaring over the Tannoy, to view what we hoped would be a vote on Boris Johnson\u2019s new Brexit deal.\n\nThose creamy, know-it-all Remainers had other plans, of course. Sir Olive Oil Letwin, greasier than two scoops of Swarfega, had tabled an amendment to delay the vote even further. The chamber was rammed. Even Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove was forced to park himself on the floor in front of the Speaker. Dotty Lord Adonis looked on. Ben Bradshaw (Lab, Exeter) played kissy-face with Sally Bercow (wife of John). Was that ex-Speaker Betty Boothroyd, 90, clasping a cane and giving a proprietorial chuckle over proceedings? It probably goes without saying but to get the Commons to sit on Saturday, the first time since the outbreak of the Falkands War, is no small operation.\n\nBoris Johnson delivering a statement on his new Brexit deal in the Commons on Saturday\n\nI heard not a word of complaint all day from Parliament\u2019s \u2018men in tights\u2019, many of them ex-military types who carry out their duties with a courtesy and professionalism that should put their masters to shame.\n\nCompare that to the huffy faces down in the chamber. Most MPs sat cross-armed, vapours of steam emanating from their earlobes, fulminating at this unwelcome intrusion. Last Thursday, I had listened with incredulity as Chris Bryant (Lab, Rhondda) suggested that members of the House (salary: just shy of \u00a380,000) be reimbursed for childcare costs for the inconvenience of working one Saturday at a moment of national crisis. What planet do these people inhabit?\n\nBoris was on his toes at 9.30am, pitch and tone slow, respectful, methodical. Weird. Like Bob Dylan going electric for the first time \u2013 but in reverse. He reiterated that he would not demand any delay from Brussels.\n\nFather of the House Ken Clarke pictured alongside former PM Theresa May. Mrs May ended up giving the star turn of the afternoon\n\nJeremy Corbyn was the usual: rant, rant, rant. Same with SNP leader Ian Blackford who did one of his customary \u2018people of Scotland\u2019 oratories. Man o\u2019 the people Blackers of course, who made his fortune in the City of London. Blackford insisted the PM\u2019s deal was worse than the one Theresa May put before the House.\n\nMrs May shot him one of those delicious bowie-knife stares she used to give him across the despatch box. Anyone familiar with their exchanges will know she treats him much like a commuter regards a piece of bubble gum on their shoe.\n\nBy the by, Mrs May ended up giving the star turn of the afternoon. One might have suspected she would become one of those sad, bitter types who end up haunting the chamber a la Ted Heath. Not a bit of it. Her remark that Parliament\u2019s attempt to block Brexit was an \u2018egregious con trick on the British people\u2019 provoked approving gurgles from the Government benches.\n\nLast Thursday, I had listened with incredulity as Labour MP for Rhondda Chris Bryant (pictured) suggested that members of the House (salary: just shy of \u00a380,000) be reimbursed for childcare costs for the inconvenience of working one Saturday at a moment of national crisis\n\nMPs including Jo Johnson (bottom left) listening to the Prime Minister debating the revised Brexit deal\n\nInevitably, we had the usual pro-Remain speeches from Hilary Benn (Lab, Leeds Central); Yvette Cooper (Lab, Pontefract) and the customary yawnathon from Dominic Grieve (Ind, Beaconsfield).\n\nForgive me, but by the time they were over I relented \u2013 and went to the pub. Inside, a throng of weirdo anti-Brexit protesters had gathered after their People\u2019s Vote march: a group of sandal-wearers who spent an age debating over the merits of different beers before placing their order.\n\nWe\u2019re now promised a vote on Boris\u2019s deal tomorrow. Please, please, people. Let us be finally be shot of this.", "description": "HENRY DEEDES: Well that was a waste of a perfectly good Saturday. Not just any Saturday, either.
