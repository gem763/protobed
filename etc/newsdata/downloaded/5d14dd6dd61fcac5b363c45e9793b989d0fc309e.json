It\u2019s the least aggressive form of kidney cancer \u2026 [with a] very low rate of recurring.\u201d\n\nDoctors were able to remove the tumor on his kidney completely, leaving him with 80% of his right kidney, according to Mathison.\n\nLast week, Mathison opened up about his diagnosis to \u201cGMA\u201d revealing that he had a 4.2 centimeter mass growing inside his right kidney and saying that it was \u201cconsistent to renal cell carcinoma.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just felt like something was wrong. It just wasn\u2019t quite right,\u201d he said.\n\nDoctors believed that the tumor had been growing there for 10 years or possibly longer.\n\nAfter his surgery last week, the former \"GMA\" contributor took to social media to thank well-wishers saying, \u201cI\u2019ve been very overwhelmed and grateful for all the supportive comments and prayers. The surgery went very well.\u201d\n\nToday, the father of two is staying positive and even shared an image earlier this week showing the outpouring of support from well-wishers who have sent him cards, flowers, and even kidney beans.", "description": "Doctors had discovered a tumor growing inside the TV host's kidney.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/cameron-mathison-gty-ps-190913_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
