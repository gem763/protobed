His ban was made effective on Dec. 21, meaning he won\u2019t be eligible for next year\u2019s Olympics.\n\nThe arbitration decision says Dwyer worked with a nutritionist who suggested the pellets, which are inserted into the skin tissue near the hip.\n\nThe decision says a doctor treating Dwyer claims to have contacted an official at the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, who said the treatment was allowable.\n\nBut, the report says, neither Dwyer, his doctor nor his nutritionist followed up with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, which makes its rules and list of banned substances public and also has a hotline to respond to questions.\n\nConor Dwyer during the 2016 Rio Olympics.
