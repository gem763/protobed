The government knows its citizens want cleaner air and in September it announced a comprehensive plan to improve the air quality.\n\nChinese media is now quite aggressive in its coverage of not just air pollution but other types of environmental degradation. Today's smog is among the top stories on the major news portals, complete with slideshows of the haze. And the most recent cover story of Caixin magazine, one of China's leading business publications, looks at cancer villages cause by pollution in the watershed the Huai River, of one of China's largest rivers.\n\nThe smog may also impact Beijing's ability to continue to attract world-class athletes to sporting events. Some of the players in the Reignwood LPGA Classic on the outskirts of Beijing took to wearing face masks on the course and at least one participant of the China Open tennis tournament, Sweden's Robert Lindstedt, has been complaining on his blog about playing in the pollution.\n\nEven if the new air pollution control measures are faithfully implemented by all the relevant levels of the bureaucracy, it will be many years until China can reverse the massive environmental degradation.\n\nAs is generally the case with Beijing smog, it will only dissipate when the winds sweep down over the mountains to the north and west of the city, which according to the latest weather forecast will be Monday at the earliest.\n\nBill Bishop publishes the daily Sinocism China Newsletter from Beijing.
