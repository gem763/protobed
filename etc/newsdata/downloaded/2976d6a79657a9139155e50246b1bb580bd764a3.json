But it\u2019s a terrible idea, not least for the gift it would be to Trump.\n\nThe Orange God King would like nothing better than to play the victim; to stand before his MAGA masses with the stigmata of censorship. If Twitter acquiesced to Harris\u2019s demand it would confirm every suspicion in Trump\u2019s base about the intolerance of the left and the bias of the social media companies.\n\nAnd, of course, it wouldn\u2019t shut him up. Because nothing can.\n\nSuspending him from Twitter would also be a very bad look for the opposition. To be sure Trump devoutly deserves to be cancelled, but cancel culture seems a bad fit for presidential politics and banning the president of the United States does not seem like a particularly effective way of restoring democratic \u201cnorms.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Charlie Sykes", "Thebulwark.Com Kamalas-Awful-Idea"], "top_image": ""}
