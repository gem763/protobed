Look at its unexpected landing zone this week after the Liberal Democrat conference. The Tories and the Lib Dems have adopted two startlingly extreme positions \u2013 Boris Johnson heading for no deal, damn the consequences, versus Jo Swinson\u2019s revoke now, to hell with the will of the people. Both stands are alarming: one ignoring the economic fate of the nation, the other risking riots over the denial of democracy.\n\nSuddenly Labour is the moderate, thoughtful one: only another referendum has the authority to abandon or confirm the decision of the first, after three years of hellish impasse. If Swinson was trying to position the Lib Dems midway between the extremes of Hulk Johnson and Corbynism, her revoke blunder takes her party out on another distant limb. Her abrasive rejection of ever working with Jeremy Corbyn is another error: her better role should be as enabler, bringer together a progressive alliance. Caroline Lucas does that tone well.\n\nFor Labour to emerge next week as the party with the best Brexit policy, it must push for a referendum immediately\n\nFor Labour, at its Brighton conference next weekend, Swinson has opened up a golden opportunity, a chance to forget past prevarications. Labour\u2019s Brexit ditherings have often infuriated the majority of its voters who are remainers, from Corbyn\u2019s virtual no-show during the referendum campaign, to weak fence-sitting, trying to hold together with northern MPs in leave seats. Tens of thousands of Labour members have fled \u2013 some among the 30,000 remainers recently joining the Lib Dems.\n\nFor Labour to emerge next week as the party with the best Brexit policy, it must push for a referendum immediately: head-counters in parliament suggest there could now be enough MPs to back a people\u2019s vote after the Tory evictions, with Oliver Letwin and others in support. No need for the usual five months: if general elections are fought in 25 working days, so could a referendum if parliament voted it. The choice on the ballot would be between remain or whatever deal was agreed by then, probably still May\u2019s. With Brexit resolved before an election, parties would lay out more realistic manifestos for the future.\n\nIf MPs don\u2019t back a referendum and an election follows, only Labour will offer voters that final referendum say. The policy will be to try to renegotiate a better, closer relationship with the EU and to put those terms on the ballot paper. Crucially the Labour leadership would back remain.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The unity of all remainers must hold fast.\u2019 Jeremy Corbyn at Fife Jobs Rally last Saturday.

Make the deal as good as it can be \u2013 if leave wins again, it would be implemented. But no Brexit is a good Brexit, and Labour would this time lead the progressive parties\u2019 fight to persuade the country to remain, advocating EU reforms if we stay. Some Labour MPs would take the leave side: the party should be tolerant, as Harold Wilson was in the 1975 referendum, with no need for a Johnsonian expulsion of dissidents.\n\nThis referendum-remain-reform motion is backed by John McDonnell, Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry, Tom Watson, Diane Abbott, Andy McDonald and most of the shadow cabinet. An unequivocal conference motion will halt the desertion of Labour remainers to the Lib Dems, making the other two parties look extreme.\n\nTo be sure, there may be only modest popular appetite for another vote: many hearts sink at a rerun of that nation-scarring calamity. But confronted with the brutal \u201cout\u201d or \u201crevoke\u201d alternatives offered by Johnson and Swinson, it will seem the better way to resolve this crisis. Peace and healing is unlikely, but it would bring acceptance from both sides, whatever the result.\n\nThe next referendum will be a more honest fight. How much easier to combat Brexiters with a concrete deal on the table for close dissection, where it can be exposed, item by item, as so much worse than the freedoms we have now within the European Union. This time the campaign is better prepared to extol the value of the EU, better armed for combat with unicorn promises and mendacious threats of Turkish invasions.\n\nLabour cannot out-remain the Lib Dems. Thankfully, it doesn\u2019t need to | Tom Kibasi Read more\n\nBut here\u2019s Labour\u2019s risk. The Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, some other unions, some shadow cabinet leavers and controllers of blocks of delegates, back a conference motion that\u2019s absurdly impossible to sustain: they would hold a general election, negotiate a new deal and only after that negotiation would the party decide whether to back leave or remain, or to stay neutral in a referendum. Neutral! Imagine sending Labour campaigners out door-knocking in the coming election to advocate a referendum but unable to say how the party would vote on this critical issue. Surely the Labour conference will have none of it.\n\nMeanwhile Johnson might, just, pull off a deal, though every hint suggests something even worse than May\u2019s plan. Despite DUP objections, a Northern Ireland-only deal would be great for Belfast \u2013 making it the new Dublin, a magnet for investment if it stayed in the single market and customs union. But it would be terrible for the rest of the UK, excluded from the customs union that the May deal keeps us in. An open border in Ireland would be bought at the expense of hard-as-rock borders all around the rest of the UK. Scotland would rightly demand the same as Northern Ireland, or leave.\n\nThe risk is that sheer exhaustion will make any rotten deal that the Hulk drags home look better than nothing. That\u2019s when the unity of all remainers must hold fast: no party advantage-scoring, no absurd refusal to work with Corbyn, all ready to resist together any bad deal in that famous last ditch.\n\n\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist", "description": "Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s referendum plan is the best Brexit policy, says the Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee", "authors": ["Polly Toynbee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2c71090af3b891419e2157f3e02a6efe8ad7156/0_106_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=04f3c0b0097acf12ef19cffe59a0ae56", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
