Two people familiar with the matter said Geneva-based MSC, the world\u2019s second-largest container shipping carrier by capacity, exercised an option to buy the vessels as part of a previous order.\n\nThe ships likely will be deployed on the Asia-to-Europe trade lane and will be able to move 23,000 containers each. The route is the world\u2019s busiest ocean container lane and carriers including MSC, A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S and China\u2019s Cosco Shipping Holdings Ltd. use their biggest vessels there, but faltering global trade has left the operators competing more aggressively on pricing.\n\nThe Shanghai Containerized Freight Index shows freight rates from Asia to Europe at $581 per box this week, the lowest in three years. Trans-Pacific rates, which have been highly volatile on the back of the U.S.-China trade tariffs, were at $2,335 per container, the lowest this year.\n\n\u201cContainer volumes from Asia to Europe rose 4.6% on year from January to August while the fleet of new very large container ships [vessels that move more than 10,000 boxes] has grown 12%,\u201d said Jonathan Roach, an analyst at Braemar ACM Shipbroking. \u201cWith a weak European economic backdrop, combined with a very large container ship fleet expansion program, freight rate deflation has become difficult to avoid.\u201d\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Evergreen Marine Corp. last week ordered six ships of the same capacity as the MSC vessels from Samsung Heavy Industries Co., another Korean yard, for around $920 million. France\u2019s CMA CGM SA, the world\u2019s fourth-largest shipping line, in August took delivery of the first of nine 23,000-box vessels it has ordered.\n\nContainer ships move the vast majority of international trade of manufactured goods like cars, furniture, home appliances, food, clothing and electronics.\n\nTrade disputes between the U.S., China and Europe have put the brakes on global economic growth, and the International Monetary Fund projects the world economy in 2019 is on course for its weakest year of growth since the financial crisis.\n\nCarriers say the giant box ships, which are 400 meters long (1,312 feet) or about as high as the Empire State Building if turned upright, provide critical operating economies. When the ships are full, their fuel consumption per container is a quarter that of smaller vessels.\n\n\u201cThe key is to sail full,\u201d said the chief executive of an Asian operator, asking not to be named. \u201cThese days, with the global slowdown and the trade tensions, that\u2019s not the case and we are losing a lot of money.\u201d\n\nWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com", "description": "Mediterranean Shipping Co. will buy five giant container ships from South Korean yard Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering in a new sign that ocean cargo carriers are building up their capacity despite falling freight rates and weak trade growth.", "authors": ["Costas Paris", "Costas.Paris Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-117054/social", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
