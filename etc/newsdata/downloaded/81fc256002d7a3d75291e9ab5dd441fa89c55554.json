Accessories included lots of chunky platform shoes, scarves and big, wide-brimmed hats.\n\nThe clothes were more luxurious than Hilfiger\u2019s typical sporty style, with lots of leathers and velvets and faux fur. In a backstage interview, he said he chose Zendaya as a collaborator for what he sees as her intrinsic sense of style.\n\n\u201cI just thought If I could get a little eyedropper of that sense of style brought into my company, we\u2019d be cool,\u201d said Hilfiger, who previously partnered with supermodel Gigi Hadid on collections. \u201cAnd she gave me more than an eyedropper, she turned on the faucet.\u201d\n\nZendaya said she and her design team were given a lot of leeway.\n\n\u201cHe just let me do whatever I wanted to, which was great,\u201d she said of Hilfiger. \u201cHe told me I could be as creative as I wanted.\u201d\n\nHilfiger said the collaboration brought his company a new dimension.\n\n\u201cThis is a reinvention for us, because it took us to another area of fashion that we\u2019ve never been into,\u201d the designer said.\n\nThe huge cast of models was a diverse crowd, in terms of size, background, gender and age. Many of them pranced joyously to the \u201870s and early \u201880s music, played by 20 or so musicians who were set up in classic American convertibles of the period. The musicians were from Vy Higginsen\u2019s Harlem-based performance training center, the show notes said, called the Mama Foundation for the Arts.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tommy Hilfiger never shies away from spectacle when it comes to his runway shows, and his return to New York Fashion Week after several years was no exception.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gary Hamilton", "Jocelyn Noveck"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/ny_fashion_week_tommy_hilfiger_29634_c0-128-3064-1914_s1770x1032.jpg?356a32e278477541111b142b07d043937a38677a", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
