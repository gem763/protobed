Critics warned that the offensive could undermine security at the prisons and camps, allowing the Islamist militants to escape.\n\nErdogan\u2019s remarks came as fighting between the two sides intensified in villages and towns along the border Thursday. The president said Turkey had killed more than 100 SDF fighters as Turkish troops pushed deeper into Syrian territory, seizing two villages near the border town of Tel Abyad.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKurdish officials said that at least eight civilians were killed by Turkish strikes since Wednesday but downplayed Turkey\u2019s claims its troops had advanced on key areas.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the SDF said Turkish shelling had targeted a prison holding Islamic State fighters in the northeastern city of Qamishli. In Turkey, 12 people were wounded by mortar and rocket fire from Syria, the state-run news agency reported.\n\nTurkey views Syrian Kurdish fighters as terrorists because of their links to Turkey\u2019s Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which has waged a decade-long battle in southeastern Turkey for greater autonomy. Turkey has launched cross-border attacks on PKK bases in northern Iraq since the 1990s. Last year, Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels routed Kurdish militants from the border town of Afrin in northern Syria.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nErdogan had long vowed to target the Kurdish militias in Syria\u2019s northeast, where U.S. troops battling the Islamic State had partnered with the SDF. Turkey and the United States, who are NATO allies, were negotiating the parameters of a potential safe zone when Erdogan announced the planned offensive.\n\nPresident Trump said he was ordering the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the area ahead of the operation.\n\nSyrian residents Thursday described scenes of mayhem as civilians fled clashes on the border. Also Thursday, international aid agencies warned of a humanitarian crisis, saying that an estimated 450,000 people living within three miles of the Syria-Turkey border were at risk.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI had to leave with only the clothes I had on me,\u201d said Mikael Mohammad, a clothing shop owner from Tel Abyad, which lies a quarter-mile from the Turkish frontier. Mohammad and his family left the town as soon as the bombardment started Wednesday evening. He said they slept outside in a rural area some 25 miles south of Tel Abyad.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe shelling is barbaric and indiscriminate. We spent the night in the open air among scorpions and snakes,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything I rebuilt in the last few years, I may have just lost again.\u201d\n\nIn Ras al-Ayn, 75 miles east of Tel Abyad, said a man who identified himself only as Nawras out of concern for his safety. He said residents suffered a night of intense shelling and that villagers fled when airstrikes resumed in the morning.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople are still leaving Ras al-Ayn as we speak,\u201d said Nawras, an electrician. \u201cI\u2019m being told that the city is still being targeted and that we should not consider going back for now.\u201d\n\nDadouch and Khattab reported from Beirut.
