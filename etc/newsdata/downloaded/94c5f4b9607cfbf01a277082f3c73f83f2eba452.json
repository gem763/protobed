After every game, I\u2019ll go straight to my mum and dad.\u201d", "description": "Manchester United captain Katie Zelem has waited her whole life for a women\u2019s Manchester derby, and now two have come along in six weeks.", "authors": ["Sophie Penney", "Dame Sarah Storey", "Becky Downie"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/womens-sport/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000213470827-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqq0hXPkI_GX3QDYmEw99JfDlaTMTxUhlzF8Rkw038U-A.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
