Indeed, I\u2019ve spilled some of that ink myself \u2013 at least in digital form.\n\nBut beyond its crippling economic effects, socialism takes something of even greater value: our freedom. Consider the lessons from history. Bill Federer writes that in the former Soviet Union:\n\nprivacy was nonexistent\n\npress was censored\n\nfree speech disappeared\n\nhealthcare was rationed\n\neconomy was regulated\n\nprivate industry was collectivized\n\npolitical dissent was punished\n\nmedia and entertainment was propagandized\n\nchildren\u2019s education became indoctrination\n\nmarriage and families were subject to social engineering\n\nreligion was suppressed\n\nhuman life was valued only by its usefulness to the soviet society\n\nWhy? Because socialism is not just \u2013 or even primarily \u2013 an economic matter. History demonstrates that economic freedom is directly tied to other freedoms and benefits. As offered by Kay Cole James, the president of the Heritage Foundation, these include \u201cgreater individual freedom, better health, more educational options, and a cleaner environment.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, a government that \u201cknows best\u201d when it comes to economics will soon assert its superiority when it comes to education, parenting, religious doctrine, and even human sexuality.\n\nThese are not theoretical shifts, nor is this idle speculation about slippery slopes. Consider speech codes on university campuses. Consider the Ohio court that removed a 17-year-old girl from her parents when they objected to her receiving hormone treatments and declined to refer to her by the male name she had chosen. Consider the case of Colorado cake artist Jack Phillips and other creative professionals, whom government officials have repeatedly targeted with threats of fines or even imprisonment because of their faith. Or consider the proposed federal Equality Act, which would impose the government\u2019s view of sexual orientation and gender identity nationwide.\n\nIn short, socialism offers forced conformity to a leftist worldview, both economically and socially. And it is not an a la carte menu. If you\u2019re still not convinced, consider this excerpt from Jarrett Stepman\u2019s article, I Went to a Socialism Conference. Here Are My 6 Observations.\n\n\"Socialists at the conference focused more on social change, rather than electoral politics, but there were still many core public policy issues that animated them; notably, \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and government run-health care, some kind of Green New Deal to stop global warming (and more importantly, abolish capitalism), open borders to increase class consciousness and promote transnational solidarity, removing all restrictions on\u2014and publicly funding\u2014abortion, and breaking down social and legal distinctions between the sexes.\n\n\"They were particularly able to weave their issues together through the thread of \u201coppressor versus oppressed\u201d class conflict\u2014for instance, supporting government-run health care meant also unquestioningly supporting unfettered abortion and transgender rights.\"\n\nThese words should gravely concern supporters of freedom. Socialism is being used as a vehicle for attacks on religious freedom, children, the family, and even biological realities. Let us not forget, a government that gains more control does not easily surrender it. And a government that controls the means of production and the distribution of wealth will soon use its power to regulate the means of existence and the distribution of ideas.\n\nSocialism hands the government the keys to our economy, our cultural institutions, and our most cherished possession: our freedom. We are blessed to live in America, in a constitutional republic that guarantees government protection of certain inalienable rights that are bestowed by our Creator. We must stand firm against political or cultural efforts to surrender this freedom or to transform the government from the guarantor of our rights to the source of those rights.\n\nSocialism pulls back innovation, disincentivizes success, and rewards failure. And it comes at a steep cost that we cannot afford to pay: our freedom.", "description": "Much ink has been spilled discussing the economic impact of .09/24/2019 9:35:18AM EST.", "authors": ["James", "Beth Baumann", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/259/eac617a8-ae72-49f3-a07a-eeb1e02d2f9a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
