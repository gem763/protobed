[USD/]\n\nOn the trade front, meanwhile, new 25% U.S. tariffs on Italian cheese, French wine, Scotch whisky and thousands of other European food products will lead to higher prices ahead of the holiday season and cost American jobs, trade groups said on Thursday.\n\nGold is widely considered a safe store of value during economic and political uncertainty.\n\nAmong other precious metals, platinum fell more than 1% to $881.05 an ounce and was down more than 4% this week, putting it on track for its biggest weekly decline since May.\n\nSilver gained 0.2% to $17.59 and palladium rose 0.4% to $1,659.64, set fopr a 1.5% fall on the week after eight weekly gains.", "description": "Gold prices rose for a fourth straight session on Friday, buoyed by safe-haven sentiment after weak U.S. data deepened concerns over economic growth, with eyes now turning to a jobs report that could signal further U.S. rate cuts.", "authors": ["Diptendu Lahiri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436871661&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9305M", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
