USA TODAY\n\nThe XFL will hold its inaugural draft next week, and the initial pool of players features some names that will be familiar to college football and NFL fans.\n\nPerhaps the most notable player listed in Monday's release was quarterback Connor Cook, a fourth-round pick of the Oakland Raiders in 2016 out of Michigan State. A three-year starter who slid on draft day, Cook made his lone NFL start as a rookie in an AFC wild-card loss to the Houston Texans after Derek Carr was injured.\n\nBut unlike other positions, quarterbacks will not be selected by teams when the XFL holds its draft on Oct. 15-16. Passers instead will be assigned by the league to each of the eight teams. The organizations will then fill out their 71-man rosters with the draft, which will occur in five phases: skill-position players, offensive linemen, defensive front seven, and open draft for all positions and specialists.\n\nFormer Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Landry Jones became the first player to commit to the league in October.\n\nThe XFL said it will add players daily to its list until Oct. 11, when it is expected to reach 1,000 names.\n\nHere are some of the other notable names available for the draft:\n\nRB Jonas Gray \u2014 The Notre Dame product had a brief star turn for the Patriots in 2014, when he ran for 201 yards and a franchise-record four touchdowns in a win over the Colts. But five days later, he overslept and was late to practice, landing him in Bill Belichick's doghouse. He played sparingly the rest of the year and was released the following September.\n\nK Roberto Aguayo \u2014\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bA second-round pick of the Buccaneers in 2016, the former Lou Groza Award winner had a disastrous rookie campaign, converting just 22 of 31 field goal attempts. He was released the following August and has yet to make an active NFL roster since.\n\nWR Jalen Rowell (Robinette) \u2014\u200b The former Air Force receiver's draft dreams were dashed in 2017 when the Department of Defense reversed course by ruling he would have to fulfill his two-year active duty commitment. Rowell, who formerly went by Robinette, had been projected as a mid-round pick and was the first Air Force player ever invited to the East-West Shrine Game, the Senior Bowl and the NFL scouting combine.\n\nQB Jake Heaps \u2014\u200b Rated the No. 1 pocket passer by Rivals.com out of high school, Heaps signed with BYU in 2010. He played for two years but transferred after the 2011 season to Kansas and later to Miami.\n\nRB Ty Isaac \u2014\u200b A five-star recruit out of high school, Isaac played one season at USC before transferring to Michigan. He never rushed for more than 550 yards in a season.\n\nDT Sealver Siliga \u2014\u200b In three years with the Patriots, Siliga played in 25 games and made 13 starts, recording 83 tackels and 5 1/2 sacks.\n\nQB Darron Thomas \u2014\u200b Under Chip Kelly, he helped power Oregon to the 2011 BCS National Championship Game against Auburn. He also piloted the Ducks to a Rose Bowl win over Wisconsin the following year, finishing his career with 5,910 passing yards and 66 touchdown throws.\n\nFollow Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz on Twitter @MikeMSchwartz.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
