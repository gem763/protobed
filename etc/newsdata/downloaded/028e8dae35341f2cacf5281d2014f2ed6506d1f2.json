Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) about her record on crime.\n\n\u201cYou used to oppose the legalization of marijuana; now you don\u2019t. You used to oppose outside investigations of police shootings; now you don\u2019t,\u201d Davis said, referring to Harris\u2019 positions in her former role as California attorney general. \u201cYou\u2019ve said that you changed on these and other things because \u2018You were swimming against the current and thankfully, the currents have changed.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cBut when you had the power, why didn\u2019t you try to effect change then?\u201d Davis asked as the room erupted in cheers.\n\nAP Photo/David J. Phillip Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) speaks at the Democratic presidential primary debate hosted by ABC at Texas Southern University in Houston.\n\nHarris has faced criticism from progressives over her record as California\u2019s top prosecutor. Her truancy policy resulted in criminal prosecutions of parents, for example, and she was unwilling to take on the state\u2019s death penalty.\n\nThe senator handled Davis\u2019 question pretty well though, saying there have been \u201cmany distortions\u201d of her record and pivoting to her achievements.\n\n\u201cI took on the position that allowed me, without asking permission, to create one of the first-in-the-nation initiatives that was a model, and became a national model, around people who were arrested for drugs and getting them jobs,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI created one of the first-in-the-nation requirements that a state law enforcement agency would have to wear cameras and keep them on full time. I created one of the first-in-the-nation trainings for police officers on the issue of racial bias and the need to reform the system.\u201d\n\nHarris conceded there was plenty more she could have done in her former job, but noted that her newly released criminal justice plan includes bold ideas like ending mass incarceration, ending solitary confinement and shutting down for-profit prisons on her first day in the White House. That last proposal drew applause.\n\n\u201cAs president of the United States, knowing the system from the inside, I will have the ability to be an effective leader and get this job complete,\u201d she said.", "description": "\"When you had the power, why didn't you try to effect change?\" asked ABC News correspondent Linsey Davis.", "authors": ["Senior Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7af2cc240000c92b78eeb2.jpeg?cache=asgidshxxt&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
