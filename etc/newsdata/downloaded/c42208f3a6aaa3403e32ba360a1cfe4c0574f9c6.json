Leading the way was the DAX30, which rose by 0.91%. The CAC40 and EuroStoxx600 weren\u2019t far behind, with gains of 0.21% and 0.61% respectively.\n\nEconomic data was on the lighter side on Monday, leaving geopolitics in focus at the start of the week.\n\nUK Parliament voted to delay a meaningful vote on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal on Saturday, leaving the British PM with little choice but to request another extension.\n\nWhile the extension is expected to be approved by the EU, there\u2019s still talk of Britain leaving the EU by Halloween.\n\nOn Monday, Boris Johnson failed once more to push through a debate on the latest agreement, leaving the Pound in limbo. While the latest news was negative, the request for an extension supported risk appetite on the day.\n\nAs far as the European markets were concerned, a no-deal Brexit appears to be averted, which provided support on the day.\n\nThe Stats\n\nIt was a quiet day on the Eurozone economic calendar on Monday. Germany\u2019s September wholesale inflation figures were the only stats for the markets to consider on the day.\n\nAccording to Destatis,\n\nProducer prices rose by 0.1% in September, month-on-month, which was better than a forecasted 0.2% decline. In August, producer prices had fallen by 0.5%.\n\nEnergy prices rose by 0.4%, while producer prices excl. energy fell by 0.1%.\n\nPrices of intermediate goods fell by 0.3%, while prices of non-durable consumer goods rose by 0.2%.\n\nThere was also an increase in prices for durable consumer goods, which rose by 0.1%.\n\nPrices for capital goods remained unchanged in the month.\n\nYear-on-year, producer prices fell by 0.1%, following a 0.3% rise in August. Economists had forecast a 0.3% decline.\n\nThere were no material stats out of the U.S to test the majors late in the session.\n\nThe Market Movers\n\nFor the DAX: It was a bullish day for the auto sector. Continental led the day rising by 1.88%, with Daimler gaining 1.50%. Volkswagen and BMW saw more modest gains of 0.71% and 0.55% respectively.\n\nBank stocks were also on the move with Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank rallying by 5.32% and by 2.46% respectively.\n\nLeading the way on the day, however, was Wirecard, which rallied by 5.59% on news of appointing KPMG to provide an independent audit. Wirecard had hit the news wires for the wrong reasons recently over its accounting practices.\n\nFrom the CAC, it was also a positive day for the banks. Credit Agricole and Soc Gen rose by 2.12% and by 1.98% respectively. BNP Paribas wasn\u2019t far behind, gaining 1.75%. For the autos, it was a less eventful day, with Peugeot and Renault rising by 0.34% and by 1.08% respectively.\n\nOn the VIX Index\n\nIt was back in the red for the VIX on Monday, bringing to an end a run of 3 consecutive days in the green. The VIX Index fell by 1.73%. Partially reversing a 3.34% rise from Friday, the VIX ended the day at 14.0.\n\nThe downside came despite Brexit woes, as British PM Boris Johnson failed for the 2nd time to get a meaningful vote on the new Brexit deal.\n\nWith no material stats to influence, corporate earnings results from the U.S, weighed on the VIX as the U.S majors also closed out the day in the green. Adding to the downside on the day was optimism on trade, as Trump talked up progress on trade talks.\n\nThe Day Ahead\n\nIt\u2019s another quiet day ahead on the Eurozone economic calendar. There are no material stats due out of the Eurozone to provide the majors with direction on the day.\n\nThe lack of stats will leave the markets to respond to events in the UK parliament on Monday. Positive comments from the U.S President on trade talks with China should also provide support.\n\nLate in the session, economic data due out of the U.S is limited to September\u2019s existing home sales figures that will likely be brushed aside by the markets.", "description": "Positive sentiment towards the U.S \u2013 China trade negotiations and the blocking of a no-deal Brexit are positives on a quiet day on the economic calendar.", "authors": ["Bob Mason"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9xJGdjFB6e9HuuKYWjz_Zg--~B/aD01ODY7dz03NjE7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/9149162e9c2cca8424e68e3b5c36b845", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
