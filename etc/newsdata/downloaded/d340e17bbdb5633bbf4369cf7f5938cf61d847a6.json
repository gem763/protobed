I did feel pressure to always look polished when I met my male colleagues at the airport.\n\n'It felt like it was ok for them to turn up in the early hours looking dishevelled but not for me.\n\nHannah, pictured recently wearing make-up after the treatment, told how she made the decision to have permanent eyeliner as her job requires a lot of early morning starts and flights abroad\n\nHannah said the tattoed eyeliner (pictured) was uneven and nothing like what she'd asked for in its style\n\n'Very often I would find myself in back-to-back meetings with little time to re-apply make-up and I thought having permanent make-up would allow me to look polished throughout the day.'\n\nHannah had previously had her eyebrows microbladed when she lived in Milton Keynes and suffered no side effects.\n\n'It saved me time and I was happy with the results,' she said. 'I decided I would have eyeliner and my lips permanently tattooed.\n\n'As I don't wear foundation I would only need to apply blusher and mascara, making getting ready before leaving for the airports at 2.30am much easier and quicker.'\n\nHannah said her extensive research - which included browsing forums, reading reviews and studying images of previous work on Instagram - led her to choose the Harley Street practitioner.\n\nHannah knew the upmarket location would result in a higher bill but decided it would be worth it as she expected the work to be of better quality.\n\nDespite being left with injuries akin to GBH, Hannah's attempts to pursue a civil case against the practitioner have been thwarted because she is uninsured - highlighting the dangers of unregulated salons offering cosmetic treatments\n\nCalling into the office in person, she made an appointment and paid a \u00a3400 deposit on her credit card.\n\nOn the day of her visit to the clinic in May last year, Hannah said she was 30 minutes early for her 10am slot and said she was not seen until 10.30am - and that worryingly, she kept referring to her as Harriet rather than Hannah.\n\n'She claimed she'd had a house fire in her flat that weekend and she was barefoot as she had broken her foot, but she was not wearing a medical boot,' Hannah recalled.\n\n'She then proceeded to tell me that she had misplaced her phone. She seemed in an odd state and kept calling me by a different name. I asked her if she wanted to postpone but she said no.'\n\nHannah claims the practitioner rushed through the consultation and signing of the consent forms, failing to examine her eyes or her lips at all and spoke more about her eyeliner than what Hannah was seeking - which was a 'girl next door' and 'natural' look with tiny flicks at the end.\n\nDescribing the ordeal as like a scene from a 'horror film', Hannah - who is blind in her right eye so couldn't see what was happening - said she was told to stop behaving like a baby when she screamed and struggled in agony. Pictured after the treatment\n\nHannah had previously had her eyebrows microbladed when she lived in Milton Keynes and suffered no side effects\n\nHannah said she told the practitioner she was blind in her right eye and that the eye was artificial, hoping she woud realise she needed to be more careful with her treatment.\n\nOnce she lay down, Hannah said the practitioner briefly applied eyeliner pencil to shape out her eyes then applied a cold gel.\n\n'I asked to see the eyeliner shape and she said I couldn't open my eyes as the anaesthetic had been applied and that if I opened my eyes they would burn and I would risk blindness,' Hannah claims.\n\n'This scared me as I am already partially blind and did not know any of this beforehand.'\n\nHannah alleges she could hear the practitioner banging into things and dropping items and then bizarrely asked to use Hannah's phone to call her mobile network provider to chase her missing mobile.\n\nOnce she lay down, Hannah (pictured recently) said the practitioner briefly applied eyeliner pencil to shape out her eyes then applied a cold gel\n\nHaving had cosmetic work done previously, Hannah said she was used to feeling uncomfortable during it - but this pain was something else\n\nShe added she could then hear the practitioner shouting in the next room during her 20-minute phone call and could sense she was agitated when she came back into the room.\n\nHannah said she tried to sit up and open her eyes but they began to burn and although she felt uneasy, the practitioner moved her head back to the bed and told her it was time to start.\n\nWhat unfolded next was like a scene from a 'horror film' according to Hannah: 'I asked again to see the eyeliner but she ignored me and switched on the tattoo machine and started working on me.\n\n'As soon as she began I just felt immense pain. All I could hear was this needle attached to a machine which was just millimetres from my eyes and on my eyelids. I felt like I was in a horror film.\n\n'I am used to pain having had cosmetic work done previously, but this pain was something else. She kept wiping my closed eyes with wipes which I later discovered was due to me bleeding so much.\n\nHannah said her hair turned grey as a result of the ordeal (pictured) and her doctor diagnosed her with PTSD\n\n'I kept telling her to stop because the pain was too much and kept trying to pull away. But she kept pushing and pinning me down and kept pressing down on my face. In doing so she pulled my lower right eyelid and has changed its shape.\n\n'She kept calling me Harriet and told me to \"suck it up\" and said, \"I have an iron-like grip and I'm not stopping until it's finished\".'\n\nAt the end Hannah said her face was flushed with saline and the practitioner told her to stop 'behaving like a baby'.\n\nAt this point Hannah felt faint, was in shock and close to tears. Her dress was soaked in saline and there was blood on it and on her face. She said she was given an antihistamine to take down the swelling.\n\nHannah piled on over three stone due to stress\n\n'I was able to just open my eyes a little,' she recalled. 'I could see about eight or nine wipes on the bed with blood and two more in my hands with blood on.\n\n'My eyes were like slits the eyelids were so swollen. She then gave me a mirror. I couldn't believe what I could see.\n\n'My eyelids were purple, there were finger print bruises around my face, and my eyelids were bleeding. The eyeliner was not what I asked for at all, it was half done, uneven, the flicks elongated, and the flicks aren't even level or matching in style.\n\n'I was speechless. She didn't seem bothered at all. All I could think was, my face has been butchered.\n\n'I wouldn't let her touch my lips and wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible.'\n\nHannah said she began feeling 'really scared' as the ramifications of the damage she'd done hit home.\n\n'I kept saying, \"This wasn't want I asked for,\" I was looking in the mirror shocked, but she literally wasn't bothered.\n\n'She kept saying it would shrink back into tiny flicks and would be even - I told her that simply wasn't true and she got angry with me.\n\n'She then started applying a thick concealer to my eyes and I pulled away. I then said I had to leave. I was feeling exceptionally ill and to be honest her behaviour was scaring me.'\n\nHannah found herself embroiled in a row with the practitioner over money for the treatment but managed to flee without paying anymore than the \u00a3400 deposit.\n\nStill in shock and severe pain, Hannah managed to catch a train home to Oxford and called NHS 111 during her journey.\n\nShe was advised to get herself to John Radcliffe Hospital as it has an eye casualty department.\n\nHannah found herself embroiled in a row with the practitioner over money for the treatment but managed to flee without paying anymore than the \u00a3400 deposit - but her corrective treatment costs more than \u00a36,000\n\nHannah said: 'As soon as I arrived in A&E, I was triaged. I was told that I was in shock and my heartrate was raised and tachycardic. I was in so much pain and all I could think was how did I get here? I did my research so why did this happen to me?\n\n'The doctor told me, \"I'm so sorry but your eyelids have been cut and the reason they have been cut is because you have the wrong type of eyelids for the cosmetic work you had done. Your capillaries are too close together and the needle will have caused your eyelids to bleed.\"\n\n'The doctor said at that point, realising her mistake, the practitioner should have stopped.\n\nAt the end of the treatment Hannah, pictured now, said her face was flushed with saline and the practitioner told her to stop 'behaving like a baby'\n\n'I was also informed that she shouldn't have applied concealer to open wounds as it was introducing bacteria and could cause an infection in my eyes.'\n\nHannah was prescribed six steroids a day for three days, and then four regular antihistamines, eight paracetamol and eight ibuprofen a day until all the swelling and pain was gone.\n\nShe claims she is now a recluse and her life has been turned upside down by what happened. Her doctor has diagnosed her with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nLorena \u00d6berg's top tips for people considering permanent make-up Do your research! Ask a friend, get a recommendation, check out the practitioners reviews across all of the social platforms. In the consultation do not be afraid to ask as many questions as you want. Identify their professional certificates \u2013 these should be hanging up in the clinic somewhere. Ask to see their client case studies \u2013 do these marry up with what you saw on social media or their website? Do not be forced into anything. If you feel uncomfortable listen to your gut. Walk away after the consultation and don't go through with anything if there is any doubt in your mind.\n\nIn the days after, her wounds became infected and she struggled to sleep because of the pain she was in and the medication she had to take.\n\nShe also piled on weight, gaining more than three stone through stress eating - and her hair turned grey.\n\nA police officer she spoke to told her that what had happened to her amounted to grievous bodily harm (GBH) and advised her to pursue a civil case. However it has transpired that the practitioner is not insured - meaning even if Hannah won her legal case, she may not be guaranteed a pay out.\n\nDescribing her ordeal, Hannah said: 'Immediately afterwards I hid away from everyone so I was not not judged for how my face looked, or to have any rumours start that I am trying to escape an abusive past.\n\n'My job was in a precarious position and I no longer socialise with friends in the way I used to.\n\n'The results of the appointment have seriously affected my confidence on a number of levels.'\n\nHannah is now being treated by Lorena \u00d6berg, who is a top skin repair expert and licensed to remove permanent make-up using lasers.\n\nLorena has been removing the eyeliner but it will take 10 sessions and costs \u00a3650 per session - but Hannah said while it's a lot of money, Lorena is 'the best in the business'.\n\n'I've had three sessions since September last year, as you have to wait for at least eight weeks after each session, and it's going to take two years to remove the ink,' she said.\n\n'Doctors have told me they won't treat my damaged eye until all the ink is removed.\n\n'In hindsight I wish I'd never had the procedure and if I had my time again I would not have gone through with it.\n\n'I haven't told many friends as people haven't been as sympathetic as I had hoped for, with many telling me, \"What did you expect?\"'", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Hannah Hopkins, 37, from Oxford, claims the 'expert' from a salon in London's Harley Street held her down despite her repeated pleas to stop and 'butchered' her face.", "authors": ["Hayley Richardson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/13/20375000-0-image-a-199_1572440705797.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
