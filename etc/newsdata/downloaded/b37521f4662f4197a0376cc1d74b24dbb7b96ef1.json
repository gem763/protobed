The governor said he has been in communication with first responders, health officials and residents living in Napa, Geyserville, and Los Angeles, California. The Kincaide Fire, roaring through much of Geyserville, and the Tick Fire, ravaging parts of Santa Clarita, have been responsible for large-scale evacuations and power outages since Thursday.\n\nCalifornia fire and weather officials held a press conference Sunday morning to caution that the Kincaide Fire in Sonoma County, which is only 10% contained, has spread and at times worsened due to extreme weather conditions. Red flag conditions \u2015 meaning warm temperatures, low humidity and powerful winds \u2015 could help spread the fire, they said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of at the peak of the wind event right now,\u201d a National Weather Service official said.\n\nCal Fire specialist Steve Volmer added that high winds could send embers from the Kincaide Fire flying, potentially causing several miniature fires to start in neighboring areas.\n\n\u201cThis fire, we know what it\u2019s doing; we know where it\u2019s going to go.\u201d Volmer said. \u201cThose new starts we\u2019re going to get are going to be problematic; they\u2019re gonna have the same effects as this fire, and the same rates of spread.\u201d\n\nAs recently as Saturday night, winds blowing the Kincaide Fire reached 76 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe fire had grown to over 44,000 acres by Sunday morning, according to the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and reports said it has destroyed 79 structures in Sonoma County to date. Roughly 200,000 people have been forced to evacuate their homes.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the red flag warning concerning dangerously high winds and low humidity will extend until 11 a.m. on Monday.", "description": "High winds and low humidity threaten to worsen a spate of wildfires across the state of California.", "authors": ["Associate Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db5f7a4200000da29506ebe.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
