Many teenagers buy safety masks with their pocket money \u2014 and their convictions strengthened. While the elderly implore police officers to put down their pistols and batons, professionals are making donations to the movement.\n\nRighting the wrong that is being done in Hong Kong is also the business of the outside world and rests on its will to confront a C.C.P.-controlled China. World leaders cannot keep mistaking their wish for the peaceful rise of China (and one that perhaps will eventually become democratic) with the reality of the Chinese Communist dictatorship today. Any act or policy that sustains the lifeblood of the Communist dictatorship in Beijing is an offense to the peoples whom that dictatorship persecutes and oppresses \u2014 in Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong and mainland China.\n\nWhen Britain handed control of Hong Kong to China in 1997, some people thought that what was then a colony \u2014 a wartime trophy of European imperial empires \u2014 was about to come unshackled. But handing Hong Kong to a reviving empire only spelled its re-colonialization. If China had been a democracy in 1997 , the handover would have meant no dispute. In reality, it turned the millions of Hong Kong\u2019s residents into refugees in their own city, subservient to the authoritarian Communist regime in Beijing.\n\nMany Hong Kongers are people, or descendants of people, who fled the mainland to escape a regime that starved tens of millions of its citizens decades ago, then murdered students in 1989 and has since persecuted political dissents incessantly. Today, that regime fuels Chinese nationalism on the mainland by delivering fragmented information and fabricated propaganda, or \u201cfake news,\u201d to its people.\n\nWe understand that some critics of American interventionism may be inclined to have sympathy for China as a still-developing country bullied by an over-dominant West. But please listen to us here in Hong Kong: Communist China is no alternative to the interventionism you hate or contest \u2014 that is an inconvenient truth that the world must reckon with.\n\nThe massive resistance movement in Hong Kong is a crisis of legitimacy for the Chinese government. The uprising is also a call for the rest of the world to support our crusade for human dignity, equality and freedom. The protesters at the front lines of these marches, who go out there in the city\u2019s streets, are doing no less than taking on that enormously powerful communist-cum-fascist regime.\n\nIn September, the struggle will only take on more life. We know that the Chinese government wants grand celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the birth of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Oct. 1 ; it wants to put history on its side by rewriting the memory of the people. But Hong Kongers won\u2019t let it commemorate that day without a fight.", "description": "You can arrest us.
