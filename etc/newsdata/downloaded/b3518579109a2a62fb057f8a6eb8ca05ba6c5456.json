The secretary of State can override the geographic restrictions if they are determined to be contrary to federal law or related policies.\n\nThe cut to refugee levels comes after the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to proceed with a sweeping ban on asylum seekers who transit through another country en route to the U.S.-Mexico border. The asylum restrictions are expected to cut off access for tens of thousands of migrant families traveling north from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that asylum seekers (who apply from inside the U.S. or at the border) and refugees (who apply from abroad) both draw on the same pool of federal resources. The administration has used that rationale to justify cutting refugee admissions in recent years as resources have been redirected to processing asylum requests.\n\n\u201cThe current burdens on the U.S. immigration system must be alleviated before it is again possible to resettle large number of refugees,\u201d the State Department said in a written statement. \u201cPrioritizing the humanitarian protection cases of those already in our country is simply a matter of fairness and common sense.\u201c\n\nMorning Shift Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

He lowered it to 45,000 in fiscal 2018 and then to 30,000 in fiscal 2019.\n\nThe United Nations Refugee Agency estimated that there were nearly 26 million refugees worldwide in 2018.\n\nThe 18,000-person refugee ceiling contains several carveouts, according to a related document provided to lawmakers Thursday and obtained by POLITICO.\n\nThe administration will reserve 5,000 slots for refugee persecuted on the basis of religion, and 4,000 spaces for Iraqis who assisted U.S. forces in that country. Another 1,500 refugee placements will be set aside for residents of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, according to the document.\n\nAfter the carveouts, the administration will make another 7,500 spaces available to the remainder of the refugee pool. The document shared with lawmakers said that group could include referrals from U.S. embassies, refugees joining family members and refugees to be resettled as the result of an Obama-era agreement with Australia.\n\nA State Department report reviewed by POLITICO in July found that nearly 9,000 refugees already were approved to travel to the U.S. at that time and remained in the queue.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, criticized the refugee cap and Trump\u2019s broader immigration policies following the announcement.\n\n\u201cRefugees fleeing violence and persecution come to the United States in search of a better life,\u201d she said in a written statement. \u201cThey should be welcomed with compassion and understanding, not turned away or have their children taken from them at the border.\u201c", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ce/34/92e974a44d5a9029a616931bb791/190826-state-department-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
