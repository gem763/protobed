There were five of them in total, five Tottenham Hotspur attackers with their arms pumping and legs whirring as they exploded upfield in perfect symmetry, a fleet of footballing destruction preparing to unleash pain on a visiting defence that had nowhere to hide.\n\nSpeed, power, intensity. The move did not lead to a shot, as it turned out, but the nature of it felt as significant as any of the three goals that Tottenham hammered past Red Star Belgrade in a furiously intense opening 45 minutes here.\n\nMauricio Pochettino has spoken in recent weeks about the need for Tottenham to rediscover their \u201caggressivity\u201d if they are to recover from this dreadful run of results. His message can be summarised, at its most basic level, as urging his players to once again do what made them so effective for so much of his reign.\n\nThis particular attack, and this entire performance, felt like a step back towards their past under Pochettino and, therefore, a significant step forward. Tottenham were pressing again, winning the ball high up the pitch again, and they were attacking with a speed and precision they have been lacking for too long.", "description": "The clock reads 19 minutes past the hour in north London, and the white shirts are moving into fighter jet formation.", "authors": ["Sam Dean", "Ipek Tugcu"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/22/TELEMMGLPICT000213805745-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqhasgUMiR-rxiRxu9qBoVLWeZUH4EVV5SdM5vmtZHYmM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
