Close to it. It didn\u2019t break the skin but I have what\u2019s called compound blisters on my skin which are eight or nine inches long \u2026 I had to carry my leg, and legs are very heavy when they\u2019re not connected to anything.\u201d\n\nThe bushwalker said he slowly crawled 3km over two days.\n\n\u201cI saw the police helicopter come over on Sunday night and I was right down on the creek bed so I had access to water \u2013 but if they came back tomorrow I knew I had to crawl again.\n\n\u201cI could only get a metre or a metre-and-a-half each time before I had to stop. It was only 3km, but two days to cover 3km, I thought I was never going to get there.\u201d\n\n'We got lost': bushwalkers missing for four days in Victorian alps survived on muesli bars Read more\n\nParker said he survived by eating a protein bar and lollies which he had taken as snacks and used painkillers in his pack.\n\n\u201cI had medication. I had painkillers \u2013 Panadol and Nurofen in my pack. And I was able to put that to great use when it was needed. People in the club ask, \u2018Why would you carry 10 kilos of equipment every time you go for a walk?\u2019 This is the reason why. It\u2019s good to have it.\u201d\n\nThe Brisbane Bushwalkers community launched a search party on Monday, with a rescue helicopter finally spotting him on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nParker was winched to safety and transported to Brisbane\u2019s Princess Alexandra hospital, where he spent the night.\n\nOn Wednesday Parker said he was overjoyed to see his family again.\n\n\u201cI was fairly worried because I hadn\u2019t told anybody where I was going. I had no way of contacting them to tell there where I was. So it was the worst possible scenario.\n\n\u201c[I was thinking how] I\u2019ve done some of the hardest walks in Australia and not injured myself. And going on a three-hour training track and I\u2019ve come to grief, big time. So lessons learned and the training and influence from friends, including my ex-wife, who has trained me a lot in the long-distance stuff.\n\n\u201cMy kids live overseas. They\u2019re coming over next week, so it will be good to see them. Haven\u2019t seen them for a while. So yeah, it was getting very emotional thinking \u2013 it\u2019s not a nice way to die, just laying here waiting, waiting.\u201d\n\nThe Brisbane Bushwalkers president, Steve Simpson, said there were a number of family-friendly hikes on Mount Nebo, but that the area in which Parker was hiking required bush sense and skills.\n\n\u201cNeil knows that area intimately,\u201d he told ABC radio. \u201cHe\u2019s a very competent and capable bushwalker.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs soon as word got out that he was found and was alive there was a great feeling of celebration and relief,\u201d Simpson said.", "description": "Neil Parker said he had to \u2018carry his leg\u2019 after breaking it in a six-metre fall down a waterfall at Mount Nebo, north-west of Brisbane", "authors": ["Naaman Zhou"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed4d29142862dc46404db6e37fb6a50d7c9a4433/0_0_5129_3079/master/5129.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9b62c24aae7285162cd848d17497d8c0", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
