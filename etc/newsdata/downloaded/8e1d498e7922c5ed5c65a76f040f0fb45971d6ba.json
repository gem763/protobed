REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton\n\nPeloton said it plans to use funds from the offering to run its operations, invest in marketing and acquire new technologies.\n\nFor the year ended June 30, Peloton\u2019s revenue more than doubled to $915 million. However, its net loss widened to $195.6 million from $47.9 million a year earlier.\n\nGoldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch and Barclays are the lead underwriters for the Peloton IPO.", "description": "Shares of Peloton Interactive Inc, the fitness startup known for on-demand workout programs on its exercise bikes, slid as much as 7% in their market debut on Thursday, indicating that investors are becoming increasingly skeptical of money-losing startups.", "authors": ["Abhishek Manikandan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434265579&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1H2", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
