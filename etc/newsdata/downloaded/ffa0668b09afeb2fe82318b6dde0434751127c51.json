Kyrsten Sinema, saying she\u2019s not standing up to President Donald Trump.\n\nDan O\u2019Neal of the Arizona Democratic Party Progressive Caucus told ABC15 Tuesday that the party\u2019s liberal wing wants Sinema \u201cto vote like a Democrat rather than supporting Trump half the time.\u201d\n\nA proposed censure resolution cites Sinema\u2019s vote to confirm President Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet appointees, including Attorney General William Barr and Interior Secretary David Bernhardt. It also cites her failure to support \u201cnet neutrality\u201d legislation that requires internet companies to treat content equally.\n\nSinema was a liberal member of the Arizona Legislature but has moved closer to the political center as a member of Congress.\n\nDemocratic state committee members may consider the resolution at a meeting Saturday.\n\nSinema\u2019s office declined to comment to ABC15.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: KNXV-TV, http://www.abc15.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Progressive Democrats want their party to censure Democratic Sen.
