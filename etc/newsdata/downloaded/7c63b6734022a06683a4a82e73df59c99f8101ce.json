The support from OCIF will help accelerate expansion of its Web Development Bootcamp programming in Calgary to achieve a five-fold increase in the number of graduates to 150 annually by 2021.\n\nThe training and professional mentoring will provide a pool of junior web developers to Calgary\u2019s workforce to meet the growing need for tech talent at all levels by local companies.\n\n\u201cLighthouse Labs was built to help fast-growing Canadian tech communities develop talent efficiently and effectively, so it\u2019s extremely exciting for us to be increasing our presence in Calgary as it's an indication of the incredible growth we have all witnessed in the city's tech sector. Calgary is going through an industrial transformation and we are proud and humbled to play a part in helping Calgarians transition with it,\u201d said Jeremy Shaki, CEO of Lighthouse Labs.\n\nLighthouse Labs currently operates a satellite campus in Calgary and graduated 30 students from its cohorts in 2018. By 2021, at least 300 software developers are forecast to graduate with 270 finding placements in tech jobs or further post-secondary training within six months.\n\nLighthouse Labs will work with Calgary companies to address the coding talent needs across all industries in the city. A study for Calgary Economic Development earlier this year forecast local companies are planning to spend at least $18.4 billion on digital transformation in Alberta through 2023.\n\n\u201cTech talent is vital for us to achieve the vision for Calgary in the New Economy and leveraging OCIF to train more people to take advantage of the opportunities is one of the most impactful things we can do for Calgary companies and Calgarians,\u201d said Mary Moran, President & CEO of Calgary Economic Development, and Chief Executive Officer of the Opportunity Calgary Investment Fund. \u201cWe have innovative people in Calgary to drive digital transformation and Lighthouse Labs is providing a path for them to acquire the skills for rewarding careers in tech.\u201d\n\nThe Opportunity Calgary Investment Fund was launched by The City of Calgary in April 2018 to support investments that spur growth and create jobs in strategic sectors identified in the Economic Strategy Calgary in the New Economy.\n\nLighthouse Labs is the eighth submission to be approved for funding.\n\nAbout Opportunity Calgary Investment Fund:\n\nOpportunity Calgary Investment Fund was created as a wholly owned subsidiary of The City of Calgary in 2018 to support catalytic investments within the city that will help diversify and transform the economy. The Fund is administered by Calgary Economic Development and has a volunteer Board of Directors.
