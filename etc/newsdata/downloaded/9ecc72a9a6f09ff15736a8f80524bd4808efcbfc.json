And so for the moment an uneasy peace has broken out but one that feels indicative of far wider tensions as Joachim L\u00f6w attempts to remodel his squad.\n\nTer Stegen\u2019s frustration is understandable. With Neuer injured, he had been a regular before the World Cup only to be left out for the tournament. Neuer, having not even played for Bayern Munich since damaging his metatarsal the previous September, struggled in Russia. His form has recovered to some extent, although he is still not the commanding figure he once was, and has remained L\u00f6w\u2019s first choice. As a result, between the World Cup and the Argentina game, Ter Stegen, despite being in probably the form of his career for Barcelona, played for a total of 135 minutes in the friendlies against Peru and Serbia.\n\nGermany face long road back to top after Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s drastic overhaul | Marcus Christenson Read more\n\nWhat was telling was that he felt the need to speak out, something he apparently believed was not being adequately handled internally. Neuer then bit back, telling Ter Stegen he should be happy with any role in the national team and the spat escalated as the increasingly preposterous Bayern president, Uli Hoeness, threatened to withdraw Bayern players from Germany squads were Neuer to be replaced. He has rowed back on his comments but the row has added to the fug of discord that has hung over German football since the defeat to South Korea in Kazan.\n\nGetting the balance right is never easy. There is a need to maintain a harmonious squad environment and ensure everybody feels involved to avoid outbursts such as Ter Stegen\u2019s. And the whole point of a reserve goalkeeper is that he should be able to step in should the first-choice be unavailable; the more familiar he is with his defence the better he is likely to be able to do that.\n\nBut switching between goalkeepers can be problematic. Through the late 80s and early 90s, Cameroon had arguably the two best goalkeepers in African history, Thomas N\u2019Kono and Joseph-Antoine Bell. No manager was able to settle on one or the other, a situation exacerbated by Bell\u2019s habit of giving interviews that may be described tactfully as candid.\n\nThe men were opposites in almost every way. Bell was voluble, charismatic and proactive in his goalkeeping, forever leaving his box to sweep up behind the defensive line and, as he saw it, stifle attacks before they had really begun. N\u2019Kono was quiet, reserved, with sharp reflexes and a profound understanding of angles; he preferred to stay deep and react to shots or headers from his line. That meant the defence were never able to adopt a consistent approach, something that had severe consequences.\n\nBell was expected to play at the 1990 World Cup but after another outspoken media appearance he was dropped before the opening game, so late N\u2019Kono\u2019s wife missed her husband\u2019s clean sheet in the victory over Argentina. Expecting him to be on the bench, she had gone shopping in Milan.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen played in the friendly between Germany and Argentina.

Cameroon led England 2-1 but then conceded two penalties as Gary Lineker got in behind and was brought down by N\u2019Kono.\n\nHad he been there, Bell has always insisted, he would have had a higher starting position and would have been quicker from his line, so the space Lineker accelerated into would not have existed. But then, as Bell\u2019s critics have maintained with equal consistency, had he not mouthed off to a French magazine, he would have been there.\n\nCameroon are not the only country to have been affected by the simultaneous emergence of two high-class goalkeepers. England in the late 70s had a policy of alternating between Peter Shilton and Ray Clemence. Although there was no crisis point such as Cameroon faced in 1990, it was a compromise that suited nobody, least of all a defence who, game by game, had to adjust between playing in front of a goalkeeper who stayed deep (Shilton) and one who was comfortable advancing (Clemence).\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThat, though, should be less of a problem for Germany. Neuer and Ter Stegen are both proactive, both good on the ball, both happy to sweep behind a high defensive line. That L\u00f6w could not keep both content seems less a tactical issue than another manifestation of the failure of man-management that led to resentment before Russia as he struggled to integrate the younger players who won the Confederations Cup so impressively in 2017 into his World Cup squad.\n\nThe summary decision to end the international careers of Thomas M\u00fcller, Mats Hummels and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng \u2013 all at the time Bayern players, which, perhaps, in some way explains Hoeness\u2019s intervention \u2013 seemed to stem from a similar place. Leave them out by all means, by why decide on an irrevocable end? Hummels may be useful right now to shore up a worryingly creaky back four. Then there was the appalling, clumsy response to Mesut \u00d6zil\u2019s complaints of racism.\n\nThere is a more fundamental tactical problem, too. Germany have been at their best under L\u00f6w playing a counterattacking game, as they did at the 2010 World Cup and in the latter stages in 2014 (even the 7-1 against Brazil was primarily about ruthlessness in transition). He seems to want to play a more possession\u2011based game, even though every time Germany have attempted that under him, they have struggled with the balance between attack and defence, often leaving the rearguard exposed. It was exploited by Mexico at the World Cup and by the Netherlands on a regular basis since.\n\nGermany are in a mess; the feuding goalkeepers are only part of it.", "description": "Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s attempt to rebuild Germany\u2019s squad has hit trouble as shown by spat between rivals for the No 1 shirt", "authors": ["Jonathan Wilson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b847f6664d96088c30897da516306b6e618ad50e/43_10_3188_1914/master/3188.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9a4000cc8b4ea628c1b55d2c45cb7c86", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
