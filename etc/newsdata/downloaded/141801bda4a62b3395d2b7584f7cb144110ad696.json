He was not available for comment.\n\nBoth Farah and Rupp were formerly coached by the now-banned Salazar as was American Jordan Hasay, one of the women\u2019s favorites who also did not finish.\n\nRupp suffered a calf strain about the sixth mile and he was forced to drop out near the 23rd mile, his management company said in a statement.\n\nHasay felt a sharp pain in her hamstring after two miles, stretched and tried to continue, but was unable to, the statement added.\n\nThe race was the first for the three since Salazar was banned from the sport for four years by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) for \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u201d.\n\nSalazar has said he plans to appeal against the ruling.\n\nDebela was a second behind Cherono and fellow Ethiopian Asefa Mengstu took third in 2:05:48.\n\n\u201cToward the end I felt like I could kick forwards, I still had enough energy to sprint and it\u2019s amazing,\u201d Cherono said.\n\n\u201cI am so happy. It\u2019s my second major marathon and to come only a few months after Boston is brilliant.\u201d\n\nAmerican Daniel Romanchuk overwhelmed the men\u2019s wheelchair field to defend his title in an unofficial 1:30:26.\n\nThe 21-year-old finished more than three minutes ahead of British runner-up David Weir.\n\nSwiss Manuela Schar also retained her title, the 34-year-old winning the women\u2019s wheelchair race in an unofficial 1:41:08.\n\nFormer champion Tatyana McFadden took second in 1:45:22.", "description": "Kenyan Brigid Kosgei broke Paula Radcliffe's 16-year-old women's marathon world record but former Alberto Salazar coached athletes, including Mo Farah, were never a factor in the Chicago Marathon on Sunday.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440405969&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0HQ-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
