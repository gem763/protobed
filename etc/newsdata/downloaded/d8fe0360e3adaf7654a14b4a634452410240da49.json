Some of these matters go back many years and several comprise millions of dollars owed to workers. This is simply not good enough,\u201d she said.\n\n\"Companies should expect that breaking workplace laws will end in a public court enforcement outcome.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said the underpayments, which affected Qantas, ABC, Commonwealth Bank, Bunnings, Super Retail Group and Michael Hill Jewellers, were caused by \"ineffective governance combined with complacency and carelessness toward employee entitlements\" and warned that boards were now on notice.\n\n\u201cI intend to take this issue up with Boards around the country, because frankly that is the level within organisations that should be taking an active leadership role on this issue, and seeking assurance about compliance from executive managers.\u201d\n\nWoolworths said it was committed to fully rectifying the payment shortfalls and had put in place a plan to ensure salaried team members\u2019 pay was correct and compliant moving forward.\n\nReview extends to Big W, Endeavour Drinks\n\nThe supermarket giant estimates the total backpay, assuming the issue goes as far back as the start of the modern award in 2010, to be between $200 million and $300 million before tax.\n\nAffected current and former salaried team members will receive their full entitlements, including back payments with interest and superannuation contributions, as soon as possible.\n\nInterim back payments will be made before Christmas to salaried store team members for the two years reviewed to date (September 2017 to August 2019).\n\nEach worker may have been underpaid as much as $5200 a year, based on the top end of the estimated range and stretching back to 2010.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe review is being extended to all Woolworths Group businesses in Australia, including Big W and Endeavour Drinks, to ensure that all relevant award requirements have been met for salaried staff.\n\nWoolworths will provide an update at the half year results in February and is expected to book provisions for the under-payments at its full year results.", "description": "Australia's largest retailer will repay about 5700 salaried staff between $200 million and $300 million after finding they had been underpaid for several years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2518%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_120%2C$y_66/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1f775bd108c8437d25e9354f47f3ab67eb03b911", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
