You always go in with an idea of how you want the game to be but it never goes exactly like that and you've got to give so much credit to New Zealand the way they kept fighting right to the end. We had to dig deep to win that game,\" he said.\n\nWales had a disappointing result after a game that was too close to call right up until the last few minutes, with South Africa sealing the win at the last.\n\nRassie Erasmus, South Africa\u2019s coach, spoke abut the performances at a news conference afterwards.\n\n\"I've got so much respect for them and their coach, that I thought those last few minutes they might pull it through again, so I think a little bit of luck on our side. Proud of our guys, but also proud to win against a team like Wales, because they really are a class outfit,\" he said.\n\nAfter the semi-finals, England and South Africa occupy the first and second spots in men's rugby's world rankings, as New Zealand drop to third.\n\nThe final between South Africa and England will take place this Saturday at 10 a.m. CET.\n\nWatch a round-up chat of the action and a look ahead to Saturday in the player above.", "description": "England are through to the Rugby World Cup final on Saturday after defeating New Zealand.
