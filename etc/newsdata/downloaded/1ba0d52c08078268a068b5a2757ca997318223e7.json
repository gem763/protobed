Ilhan Omar says Trump administration 'cannot be trusted' to be transparent about Iran", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Ilhan Omar called the White House\u2019s credibility into question Monday after President Trump threatened to retaliate over recent drone strikes on Saudi Arabian oil sites.\n\nA member of the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee, the congresswoman said the Trump administration \u201ccannot be trusted\u201d to be transparent about any future evidence offered for attacking Iran in response to the strikes, which targeted two major oil facilities in Saudi Arabia early Saturday and subsequently put a dent in the world\u2019s crude supply.\n\n\u201cCongress has the constitutional right to declare war,\u201d Ms. Omar, Minnesota Democrat, said on CNN. \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t have it. The secretary of state doesn\u2019t have it. And Saudi Arabia certainly doesn\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we need to make sure that the American people understand that this administration \u2014 that lies about weather maps or crowd sizes \u2014 cannot be trusted to give us the full information we need to be able to make a decision whether we should be going to war or not with Iran,\u201d Ms. Omar added. \u201cWe are not in a position to think about another endless war, and I really hope that my colleagues in Congress are going to pressure this administration to take a step back and figure out how we use diplomacy in de-escalating the situation.\u201d\n\nThe congresswoman\u2019s remark came more than two weeks since Mr. Trump ignited controversy by falsely claiming Alabama would be impacted by Hurricane Dorian, prompting weather officials to reassure residents they would be spared from the storm. Mr. Trump refused to walk back his comments in the days after, even touting a doctored map of the U.S. to support his assertion, harking back to the first days of his administration when the White House insisted, wrongly, that Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential inauguration ceremony had the largest attendance in history.\n\nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nMr. Trump said Sunday that the U.S. was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to respond to the drone strikes, which several members of his administration, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have blamed on Iran. The president has since said that he is in \u201cno rush\u201d to take action, however.\n\n\u201cWe have to be very cautious about the way that we move forward, and I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s important for Congress to be able to investigate and take the lead on whether it makes sense for us to engage,\u201d Ms. Omar continued on CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for us to remember this is a war \u2014 our intelligence is war-tainted towards Iran and, you know, we can\u2019t forget our involvement in Iraq, and how there are people who beat the drums of war and ultimately make us regret a decade or so later.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
