The Tigers (8-0, 6-0 ACC) are 8-0 for the eighth time in school history (and fourth in the last five seasons) as they pursue a fifth consecutive Atlantic Division title and ACC championship.\n\nClemson has won nine consecutive games against Boston College and is 11-4 against the Eagles since they joined the ACC in 2005.\n\nThe Tigers scored early and often to build a 38-7 halftime lead. Clemson amassed 394 yards and averaged 9.6 yards per play in the first half.\n\nLawrence completed 16 of 19 passes for 275 yards and three touchdowns in the game, and added eight carries for 42 yards before leaving the game after the Tigers' second possession of the third quarter.\n\nHis touchdown passes covered 19 yards to Amari Rodgers and 22 and 63 yards to Diondre Overton. Overton also caught a 23-yard touchdown pass from back-up quarterback Chase Brice, giving him three receptions for a career-high 119 yards.\n\nThirteen different receivers caught at least one pass for Clemson, which substituted beginning midway through the third quarter.\n\nEtienne, the Tigers' junior running back, rushed for 109 yards and three touchdowns in his fourth 100-yard game of the season.\n\nClemson amassed 674 yards, marking the third time this season the Tigers have totaled 600 yards or more.\n\nMeanwhile, Clemson's defense shut down Boston College, holding the Eagles to 177 yards. The Tigers have held all eight of their opponents this season to less than 300 yards.\n\nBoston College (4-4, 2-3), which was coming off a 429-yard rushing day in a win against N.C. State last week, managed 97 yards on 44 rushing attempts for an average of 2.2 per rush.\n\nACC rushing leader A.J. Dillon had 76 yards on 19 carries, but did become the school's all-time leading rusher on an 18-yard carry in the third quarter, passing Andre Williams.\n\nBoston College quarterback Dennis Grosel was on the run all night and completed only 3 of 14 passes for 53 yards.\n\nClemson defensive end Logan Rudolph added a 39-yard fumble return for a touchdown in the third quarter.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Riding the arm of Trevor Lawrence and the legs of Travis Etienne, No. 4  Clemson dismantled Boston College 59-7 on Saturday night in Clemson S.C.The Tigers,...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
