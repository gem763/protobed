There are a couple caveats, of course, but this is still a no-brainer deal.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nHow to get an Amazon Echo Dot for 99 cents\n\nSo, the Echo Dot normally costs $50. To get one for 99 cents, you must subscribe to Amazon's music streaming service, Amazon Music Unlimited, for one month. In other words, this deal will cost you a total of $8.78 -- that includes the $7.99 for Amazon Music Unlimited, and the 99 cents for the Echo Dot.\n\nFollow these steps, to get the Echo Dot deal:\n\nSign in to your Amazon account. We suggest doing so from a desktop -- it's easiest. Go to this Amazon deal page. Select the Echo Dot model you want. There are three color choices available. You'll then see a listing (like this) with the Echo Dot and Amazon Music Unlimited. Add the deal to your cart and proceed to checkout. That's it!\n\nWhat are the requirements and limitations?\n\nThere are some limitations that may make you ineligible to get this deal:\n\nYou must be Prime member to get this deal for $8.78. If you're not, Amazon's terms and conditions show you'll have to pay the non-Prime price of $9.99 for Amazon Music Unlimited, bringing your total cost to $10.98. You must be a new Amazon Music Unlimited subscriber. If you already are or have been before, it won't work. However, an easy workaround is to just purchase the deal with a partner's Amazon account. You can even add him or her to your Prime benefits (see how here) in order to get this deal at the cheapest price.\n\nJust remember that your Amazon Music Unlimited subscription will auto-renew after one month. Be sure to cancel it before the month is up -- if you want -- and you'll, of course, be able to keep the Echo Dot.\n\nFor more great deals on devices, gadgetry, and tech for your enterprise, business, or home office, see ZDNet's Business Bargain Hunter blog.
