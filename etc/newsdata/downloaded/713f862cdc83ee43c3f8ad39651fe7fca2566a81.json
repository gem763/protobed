There has been so much focus on the scale of their task at Yokohama Stadium, but just imagine instead the reward that awaits - a place in sporting folklore.\n\nThe build-up to this momentous World Cup semi-final has been dominated by all the usual talk about All Black aura and so much evidence of their near-invincibility; a modern-day Test success rate approaching 90 per cent and a run of 18 successive tournament victories.\n\nNew Zealand do deserve their billing - by Eddie Jones and others - as the greatest force in the history of all team games.\n\nEngland captain Owen Farrell gives a team-talk during Friday's practice at Yokohama Stadium\n\nThe forwards, led by Luke Cowan-Dickie (centre), run amid soggy conditions at the stadium\n\nThey are up on a pedestal, for England to take aim at. For Jones's men, the motivation lies in the crusade to win the Webb Ellis Cup but they should also consider the prize for victory on Saturday.\n\nThis daunting assignment can be repackaged as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Beating these Kiwi kingpins would surely go down as the country's finest feat on a rugby field.\n\nUntil now, a reasonable argument would be that the best English win came in the summer of 2003 when Sir Clive Woodward's imperious side went to Wellington and trumped the All Blacks 15-13, despite the inconvenience of being temporarily reduced to 13 men.\n\nBut that was a one-off Test triumph, without the gravitas of a World Cup knock-out win - and the side they overcame were not a patch on the class of 2019. Months later, when Martin Johnson and Co swept to glory in the global showpiece, they did not have to beat the All Blacks. Australia did that for them in the semi-finals.\n\nSaturday's semi-final could come down to three key areas: set piece, breakdown and kicking\n\nEngland did not need to beat New Zealand on their way to Rugby World Cup victory in 2003\n\nENGLAND'S ROAD TO THE SEMI-FINALS Sep 22: England 35-3 Tonga, Pool C Sep 26: England 45-7 USA, Pool C Oct 5: England 39-10 Argentina, Pool C Oct 12: England vs France - MATCH ABANDONED Oct 19: England 40-16 Australia, Quarter-finals\n\nFour years later, they managed to reach the final again - but again New Zealand had been knocked out of their path, this time by France, so they did not have to clear the ultimate hurdle.\n\nWhile South Africa have had periods of pre-eminence, New Zealand are nearly always the benchmark in this sport with global pretensions.\n\nEngland have played them three times at World Cups and lost the lot.\n\nSo as they set out on their arduous climb on Saturday, Jones's men should have one eye on the prize; a result which would represent an all-time English pinnacle - as well as earn a place in the final, at the same stadium on November 2.\n\nDespite the cancellation of their last pool match against France, there are no significant short-cuts on this campaign trail. England beat Argentina in the round-robin stage and Australia in last week's quarter-final. If they can shock the holders, they may face South Africa, needing to complete an arduous southern eclipse.\n\nA box-office occasion is in the offing, one which should capture the imagination of the English public, in much the same way as the national cricket team did in winning their World Cup three months ago.\n\nEngland thumped Australia in the quarter-finals last week as Jonny May scored the first try\n\nMatches against the All Blacks are always highly anticipated and Hansen's team revel in their status as the self-styled 'most dominant team in the history of the world'.\n\nThere is no denying their logic but it certainly isn't an expression of humility.\n\nRemember, England are the arrogant ones. That's the Kiwi rugby establishment's perception, anyway. Of course, it is not remotely true.\n\nJones's squad know that they are the challengers and the pretenders but they have allowed themselves to convey a collective sense of self-belief, which certainly stops a long way short of arrogance.\n\nThey have taken their cue from their head coach, who livened up the countdown to this game with allegations of spying and justifiable attempts to suggest that there is more pressure on New Zealand.\n\nWhile the England players make a conscious effort to block out the historical context of the occasion, a more pressing priority for them is to gain respect. They value how they are viewed by their peers and in this particular rivalry, there is a respect deficit.\n\nThe best example from recent years came up again on Friday. During England's tour of New Zealand in 2014, All Black lock Brodie Retallick couldn't name a single visiting player. He mentioned the name Michael Laws - but it turns out that he is a politician in Auckland.\n\nAn England team, including Courtney Lawes, lost to New Zealand at Twickenham last year\n\nHe isn't an English lock. Courtney Lawes is, as he has been for a decade.\n\nWhen the Northampton player was reminded about the episode on Friday and asked if he expects the opposition players to know all about who he and his team-mates are now, he said: 'If they don't, then they will tomorrow.'\n\nWhile there was a smile on his face, the look in his eyes was one of cold intent.\n\nEngland players can talk at length about the leading Kiwis but that knowledge is not reciprocated.\n\nIn New Zealand, they do not watch much English rugby and they do not have much regard for it. There is a superiority complex in a rugby sense but, remember, England are the arrogant ones. Apparently.\n\nBeating the All Blacks is the only way to gain their respect, as Ireland found in the last few years, prior to their capitulation last weekend.\n\nEngland haven't dragged the Kiwis down from their pedestal since 2012 but that was a one-off, end-of-year Test at Twickenham. It was not on this scale.\n\nThis is when both teams go in fully loaded. This is when it really, really matters. Win this and England will make their names in two countries; at home and on the other side of the world.\n\nJones was right to say more pressure is on New Zealand. England can be relatively unburdened as they take their shot at immortality. Jones was wrong to say that nobody outside the English set-up thinks they can win.\n\nThey certainly can and if they actually do, it could go down as their finest result of all.", "description": "CHRIS FOY IN YOKOHAMA: For Jones's men, the motivation lies in the crusade to win the Webb Ellis Cup but this daunting assignment can be repackaged as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/18/20190960-0-image-a-25_1572026298673.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
