September's reading was above the median forecast of 49.6 from a Wall Street Journal poll of 11 economists.\n\nBut the index has stayed below the 50 mark for five straight months, which indicates the activity was still cooling despite its improvement. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing activity, while a reading below 50 indicates a contraction.\n\nA subindex measuring total new orders received by manufacturers in China rebounded to 50.5 in September from 49.7 in August. It was the first time the new order subindex showed an expansion since May.\n\nNew export orders, an indicator of external demand for Chinese goods, rose to 48.2 from 47.2 in August, while import orders recovered to 47.1 from 46.7 a month earlier.\n\nProduction also rebounded to 52.3 in September, compared with 51.9 in August.\n\nZhao Qinghe, an economist with the statistics bureau, said production in food processing, textiles and equipment rebounded sharply in September. China's large manufacturing companies, which typically benefit the most from the government efforts to support the economy, were the major force behind the rise in the index this month, he said.\n\nBeijing has released billions of dollars in liquidity into the banking system to encourage more lending to business as economic growth slips to a nearly three-decade low.\n\nThe official PMI data are based on the replies to monthly questionnaires sent to purchasing executives at 3,000 companies in 31 manufacturing sectors.\n\nChina 's official nonmanufacturing PMI, also released Monday, edged down to 53.7 from 53.8 in August.\n\n-- Grace Zhu\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 29, 2019 21:49 ET (01:49 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
