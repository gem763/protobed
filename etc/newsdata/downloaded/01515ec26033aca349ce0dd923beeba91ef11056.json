For now.\n\nThe Jets cut Osemele on Saturday, a day after he had surgery on his shoulder that the Jets didn\u2019t approve of. Second and third opinions on the shoulder led Osemele to have immediate surgery, while the Jets thought he could put off surgery and keep playing. The Jets are 1-5.\n\nWe have released OL Kelechi Osemele and activated LB James Burgess from the practice squad. pic.twitter.com/TGgnYUKkFx \u2014 New York Jets (@nyjets) October 26, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe relationship is over, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ve heard the last of this dispute.\n\nKelechi Osemele dispute hasn\u2019t been pretty\n\nThe ordeal has been messy in every way. The Jets wanted Osemele to keep playing. They sent blank MRI results to the doctor giving the second opinion, and claimed it was an honest mistake. The Jets were fining Osemele during the dispute.\n\nThen on Saturday, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter said surgery revealed more damage than anticipated and Osemele\u2019s representatives and the NFLPA were considering action against the Jets\u2019 team doctor for violations of State Medical Board Regulations.\n\nAnd after that, the Jets cut him.\n\nJets look terrible in Osemele ordeal\n\nIt would be hard for an organization to look more unprofessional in dealing with a player\u2019s health issue. Osemele told the New York Daily News the Jets wouldn\u2019t authorize the surgery because the \u201cconflict is that the team does not think that I\u2019m in pain.\u201d Osemele said he couldn\u2019t lift his arm. He had a torn labrum.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cA lot of guys play through injuries and you need that to play through an injury,\u201d Osemele told the Daily News, referring to the painkiller Toradol. \u201cBut once it stops working and it doesn\u2019t do anything for you anymore, then you\u2019re at a point where it\u2019s like, \u2018Now what do I do?\u2019 Do I take Vicodin? Where is the line? How much should a player play through pain? What is the limit? Is there a limit? Am I supposed to take Toradol every day? Does my health not matter?\u201d\n\nEven though the Jets have cut Osemele, let\u2019s assume the team can still dig itself a bigger hole in this matter.\n\nInjured guard Kelechi Osemele was cut by the Jets on Saturday.
