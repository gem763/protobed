What does that mean for investors?\n\nFirst and foremost, I am politically agnostic. My sole job is to help investors achieve high risk-adjusted returns. This column is neither about politics nor about the merits of the impeachment inquiry. It is about helping investors tune out the noise and rationally think about the impact of all this on their investments.\n\nLet\u2019s explore the issue with the help of a chart.\n\nChart\n\nPlease click here for an annotated chart of S&P 500 ETF SPX, +0.62%.\n\nNote the following:\n\n\u2022 The chart is divided into three segments.\n\n\u2022 The left-most segment is for a period when the economy was strong.\n\n\u2022 The middle segment is for a period when the economy was slowing.\n\n\u2022 The right-most segment is the future.\n\n\u2022 A slow-growing economy is expected in the future.\n\n\u2022 The chart shows two Arora buy signals.\n\n\u2022 The chart shows two Arora signals to protect portfolios.\n\n\u2022 The middle segment shows Trump being persistent in seeking a good trade deal with China for the long term.\n\n\u2022 The right-most segment shows the future period when Trump will have a strong incentive to strike a weak deal with China before the election.\n\n\u2022 The relative strength index (RSI) on the chart shows that the market can go either way from here.\n\nAsk Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies.

However, during that time, the economy was strong. Now the economy is slowing. For this reason, there is the potential that at this time the stock market may not be as resilient. In the future, the economy may slow even further. As a result, the stock market may be even more vulnerable to an impeachment inquiry or other similar political maneuvers. This is a potential negative.\n\n\u2022 The second most important point is that the impeachment inquiry may give Trump an incentive to strike a not-so-good trade deal with China. This is a potential positive in the short term for the stock market but negative in the long term.\n\n\u2022 You will hear a lot of statistics about the Clinton impeachment and the stock market. Consider not wasting your time and energy on such statistics. The world, the economy and the stock market conditions are very different now compared with the Clinton era.\n\n\u2022 There is a scenario under which the impeachment inquiry may turn out to be positive for the stock market. If the American public at large views impeachment as mostly politically motivated, it may increase the probability of a Trump re-election.\n\n\u2022 By contrast, if the American public views that Trump did something wrong, the momentum for a Democrat such as Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders could pick up. This would likely be a negative for the stock market.\n\nRadical leftist agenda\n\nThe stock market can do equally well under both Democrat and Republican administrations. However, if a radical leftist agenda is implemented in a way that cuts off the legs of capitalism, which has created massive prosperity, consider the following:\n\n\u2022 In this scenario, the prospect of devastating probes into big tech companies such as Apple AAPL, +1.54%, Amazon AMZN, +1.53%, Facebook FB, +0.84% and Google GOOG, +2.28% GOOGL, +2.27% would apply downward pressure.\n\n\u2022 Big bank stocks such as J.P. Morgan JPM, +0.57%, Bank of America BAC, +1.07% and Citigroup C, +2.18% may see selling on the prospect of banks being turned into utilities.\n\n\u2022 Semiconductor stocks such as Intel INTC, +2.41%, AMD AMD, +0.07%, Micron Technology MU, +1.98% and Nvidia NVDA, +3.30% may get hurt on increasing acrimony with China, as would export-oriented industrials such as Boeing BA, +1.19%, Caterpillar CAT, +0.49% and Deere DE, -0.46%.\n\n\u2022 Health-insurance stocks such as UnitedHealth UNH, -1.26%, Humana HUM, -2.65%, Cigna CI, -1.70% and Anthem ANTM, -1.69% may be decimated.\n\n\u2022 Popular pharmaceutical stocks such as Johnson & Johnson JNJ, -0.43%, Merck MRK, -0.60%, Pfizer PFE, -0.31% and Eli Lilly LLY, -1.64% may be aggressively sold.\n\n\u2022 Many of the popular high-dividend stocks may suffer.\n\n\u2022 Short sellers and those with expertise in using inverse ETFs may make out like bandits.\n\n\u2022 Short-term traders may end up making money by the boatload while buy-and-hold investors suffer.\n\nDisclosure: Subscribers to The Arora Report may have positions in the securities mentioned in this article or may take positions at any time.
