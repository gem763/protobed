(Picture: KESQ/Facebook)\n\nA woman is standing in support of a man convicted of brutally beating her one-year-old nephew to death.\n\nOn Monday, Estaban Alamo, 33, was found guilty of killing Serik Nieto in Indio, California.\n\nAlamo, who was dating Serik\u2019s mother, had been babysitting the child for up to five hours while her mother ran errands in October 2010. When the child\u2019s mother returned, she found Serik unresponsive and breathing irregularly with \u2018white, foamy saliva\u2019 on his mouth, according to the prosecutors.\n\nThe child was taken to Loma Linda University Medical Center where he was pronounced brain-dead. Serik died days later after being taken off life support.\n\nDespite the jury\u2019s decision, Stefanie Nieto, who is the child\u2019s aunt, claimed Alamo is innocent based on a conversation said she had with the victim\u2019s five-year-old sister.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nShe told KESQ: \u2018I can\u2019t say that we have closure because the truth didn\u2019t come out therefore in my mind justice still hasn\u2019t been served.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I know the baby died because he fell down the stairs. His sister told me. She said she couldn\u2019t say nothing because of her mother, which the mother was the main witness.\u2019\n\nMan 'poured beer in alligator's mouth after trying to get it to bite him'\n\nStefanie Nieto continued: \u2018Eyewitnesses in court are the worst witnesses because they\u2019re allowed to say whatever they want. There is no physical evidence linking this man (Alamo) to this crime.\n\nThe child\u2019s father, Serik Nieto Sr, who is Stefanie\u2019s brother has always believed Alamo killed his son, saying in 2011: \u2018(Serik Jr) had multiple bruises all over his body, like (when) a man beats up a man.\u2019\n\nIn an interview with police three days after Serik Jr was hospitalized, Alamo told investigators that the child came inside from playing and had no injuries except for a cut on his lip. Alamo said he assumed the boy had fallen while outside.\n\nSerik Nieto Sr said he is sure Alamo killed his son because of the injuries on the child.

I know it looks bad.\u2019\n\nAlmo\u2019s lawyers provided two alternative scenarios for how Sarik Jr died, telling the jury that the child could have fallen while playing or that his mother could have caused the injuries.\n\nHowever, the jury found Alamo guilty after three days of deliberation. He is set to be sentenced on November 22.", "description": "Estaban Alamo, 33, was found guilty of killing Serik Nieto in Indio, California in October 2010 - but a relative of the child doesn't agree.", "authors": ["Jacob Geanous"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comp-1570564582_1570566429.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
