No matter how much you watch Twitch, you\u2019\u2019ll never be able to keep up with even a fraction of the tens of thousands of partners and their daily streams, which generally last multiple hours. As a result, streamers\u2019 fame exists in pockets. In one space, like this year\u2019s TwitchCon, they can go outside and get mobbed. In another \u2014 their hometown, perhaps \u2014 they can walk down the street and be nobodies.\n\nTwitchCon is an annual convention that celebrates streaming and streamers with an exhibit hall, panels, meet and greets, concerts (sometimes performed by streamers; other times, Blink 182), and a variety of parties and surrounding activities.\n\nThis year\u2019s TwitchCon, the fifth since 2015, was one of contradictions: Legitimate stardom versus video game streaming\u2019s humble bedroom beginnings, safety and security versus fan-friendly accessibility, and the TwitchCon regular people attended versus a second, red-tape-mummified celebrity TwitchCon running in its shadow.\n\nThe second TwitchCon takes place in areas only Twitch partners can access; they\u2019re hidden or surrounded by security. There are levels to this shadow TwitchCon \u2014 a VIP area in the convention centre you can only access with a special sticker on your badge, parties and events only for select groups of upper echelon Twitch partners.\n\nPhoto: Nathan Grayson\n\nAll partners are not created equal. Where once Twitch arbitrarily handed out the designation of partner \u2014 basically, somebody with more money-making options on the platform, who Twitch views as a sort of symbolic extension of its brand \u2014 to a select few, there\u2019s now a gamified system that\u2019s anointed nearly 30,000 people who make their money performing a variety of activities, from streaming games to broadcasting themselves exploring other countries \u2014 or the street outside their house.\n\nSome partners, like Fortnite streamer Turner \u201cTfue\u201d Tenney and variety streamer Imane \u201cPokimane\u201d Anys, are knocking at the door of mainstream celebrity. They have millions of followers and have appeared at major mainstream events like the Super Bowl. Others streamers barely turn heads at TwitchCon, let alone anywhere else.\n\nWhat does it mean to only sometimes to be famous, or to be famous largely through chat boxes and Discord messages? How much responsibility do you have to general audiences, versus just to your own?\n\nDo you need to take security precautions and, if so, does that somehow diminish your cred as Just Another Regular Person streaming to an audience that sees you as an actual aspirational figure, rather than some Hollywood celebrity living in a walled garden? At this point, I think everybody has a different answer.\n\nMost fans are just regular folks who might attend a meet-and-greet and get something signed. They come away jittery but satisfied, having briefly crossed paths with somebody who takes up large chunks of their screen real estate every day.\n\nSome streamers tried to be more accommodating, talking to fans outside meet and greets and other scheduled interactions. This resulted in no small number of growing, Katamari-like crowd clumps in hallways where a sea of fans otherwise shuffled from place to place.\n\nVariety streamer Alexia Raye recognised the need to move through back channels due to the dual spectres of awkward networking attempts and security concerns, but she cast a wistful glance downward while remembering the days before things got so complicated. With tens of thousands of fans roaming a series of jam-packed convention halls, there\u2019s a strong chance someone \u2014 or a lot of someones \u2014 will recognise her.\n\n\u201cI definitely feel like this was my first TwitchCon where I was overwhelmed by how many people wanted to meet me,\u201d she said. \u201cI kinda feel like I\u2019ve done a shadow of TwitchCon, where I haven\u2019t really actually gotten to explore much of the inside. I can\u2019t just walk around freely.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Nathan Grayson\n\nOther streamers seemed to feel the same way. Despite Twitch\u2019s promises of rubbing shoulders with big names, I did not see megastar Tfue at TwitchCon, nor did I see other big names like Summit1g, TimTheTatman, or Dr Disrespect, the latter of whom is 6\u20198\u201d and should stand out like a sore thumb, even in a crowd.\n\nThe only time I encountered Pokimane, the most popular female streamer, was at her own pizza party, and even then, it was for two seconds as part of a hundreds-strong procession of people who received the exact same photo opp and little more from a streamer who, during streams, feels like she could be anybody\u2019s cool friend.\n\nThese big streamers were around the convention \u2014 at least, according to the TwitchCon website \u2014 but they were extremely judicious about deciding when to appear and when to stick to TwitchCon\u2019s twisting backstage labyrinth. The biggest celebrities, it seems, kept to themselves.\n\nOne evening, after TwitchCon itself had shut down for the day, I did a double-take as Ali \u201cMyth\u201d Kabbani, a Fortnite wunderkind with 5.5 million followers, walked past me on a largely empty footpath.\n\nI hadn\u2019t seen anybody on his level strolling about out in the open like that \u2014 although \u201cstrolling\u201d might be the wrong word. He and a couple other people, one of whom had a camera, were power-walking with purpose. I have no idea where they were headed, or why, and there wasn\u2019t time to ask.\n\nA chill breeze carried the scents of bacon and booze through the air. The balcony was loud and crowded, but the atmosphere was far more relaxed than the rowdy scene in the convention centre.\n\nPhoto: Martin Garcia, (ESPAT Media\n\nFor streamers, TwitchCon is a place to both make fans\u2019 days and party all night (and, sometimes, also for part of the day). For some, partner-only events, dinners, and parties are a rare opportunity to spend substantial time with other people who do what they do.\n\nIt\u2019s a place to break up the lonely monotony of being professionally sequestered away in their rooms all day, a place to vent and joke about the very particular rigours of their careers \u2014 or just catch up. Fans are not invited.\n\nSometimes, those people want to do business with the biggest fish in the increasingly large partner pond. This, however, is generally considered a no-no. I talked to multiple streamers at TwitchCon who maligned the practice of other streamers cornering them at parties to talk shop or beg for a collaboration. \u201cTime and place,\u201d said one. \u201cTime and place.\u201d\n\nFor all the fans who took pictures with their favourite streamers, proudly announced who they were from Twitch chat, or gave quick hugs and then scampered away to geek out to their friends, a handful of fans didn\u2019t seem to know where to draw the line. They stuck around too long, maybe even followed people they idolise from place to place.\n\nBut for popular streamers, many of whom built their reputations on friendly accessibility \u2014 not just streaming on Twitch, but also making clans and guilds in games and talking to subscribers on Discord \u2014 it\u2019s not as simple as just telling a clingy, slightly creepy fan at TwitchCon to take a hike.\n\n\u201cAs a streamer in general, you\u2019re gonna have some weird ones,\u201d AvaGG, a variety streamer who\u2019s most recently gotten into Grand Theft Auto V role-playing, told Kotaku. \u201cAnd then as a female, you get the extra weird ones... I had one guy follow me to dinner, but I don\u2019t know how to be like \u2018No.\u2019 So I was like \u2018OK, I\u2019m gonna eat with my friends now,\u2019 and he just followed me to the restaurant. Most of them aren\u2019t aware of how they\u2019re coming off. Maybe they just don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Nathan Grayson\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising, perhaps, that fans drawn by a streamer\u2019s appearance of accessibility can find it hard to draw the line. Sometimes, things escalate. Ava said she\u2019s dealt with stalkers in the past.\n\nAnother streamer, Annie, who streams for Overwatch League team The Florida Mayhem, said in a now-deleted tweet that she got followed and catcalled all the way back to where she was staying during TwitchCon.\n\nAs streamers amass more and more fame, these sorts of occurrences aren\u2019t just confined to gatherings like TwitchCon. This is especially true of big streamers who have a tendency to be open about their locations, which on one hand aids in creating the impression that they\u2019re chill, accessible people, but on the other, opens them up to impromptu visits from fans who might not regard personal space as the highest priority.\n\nAlexia Raye told Kotaku about a time one of Twitch\u2019s most popular streamers, star Fortnite player Turner \u201cTfue\u201d Tenney, came to visit her and her significant other, Tfue\u2019s former Fortnite partner Dennis \u201cCloakzy\u201d Lepore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve found that, whenever he comes and visits, there\u2019s a lot of people that show up at our house,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just becomes kind of a security risk. But then I have to be the bad guy and be like \u2018No, you can\u2019t meet him at our house.\u2019\n\nBut another example would be, we went to Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods to grab something. I think we were actually getting pepper spray, just in case. One of the employees took a picture of Tfue, and apparently they Snapchatted it. All of the sudden, people just flooded there. It was just this huge ordeal.\u201d\n\nHis concern was understandable. Kitboga, after all, has likely made at least a few enemies by revealing scams for all to see. While he\u2019s yet to face direct reprisal from any of the people orchestrating these scams, you can never be too cautious. As a result, his real name is not public information, and his house is in a trust as opposed to \u201cregistering with the state and saying where your exact address is.\u201d Even so, there are cameras on his house.\n\nHe thinks that, speaking broadly, streamers still aren\u2019t secure enough in their dealings, despite the gargantuan audiences they stand to attract and eye-opening moments like the time somebody shot out a window in Dr Disrespect\u2019s house last year.\n\nImage: Kitboga\n\n\u201cA lot of people sign up to Twitch, and sometimes their username is their name, or they have a Facebook where people can just friend them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to a degree that\u2019s cool, because you\u2019re friends. But it gets to a point where, if you know somebody\u2019s real name and phone number, you can find out everything about them. It\u2019s about being conscious about it and thinking ahead of time, so you can be safe.\u201d\n\nWe talked on the outside patio of a restaurant near the San Diego Convention Centre, where TwitchCon was held. Though the clouds were an uncharacteristically gloomy grey, many people were out on a nearby street. A handful recognised Kitboga and walked up to say hi during our interview. Nobody was angry or threatening. Still, Kitboga\u2019s bodyguard\u2019s focus did not waver.\n\n\u201cEveryone can always do a better job,\u201d Kitboga said of streamer security.\n\nNone of the other streamers I talked to at TwitchCon had bodyguards.\n\nOn a pair of chairs that wouldn\u2019t have looked out of place in a hip 20-something\u2019s living room, Twitch CEO Emmett Shear and longtime variety streamer Ezekiel_III casually bantered back and forth on topics ranging from lighthearted (Shear\u2019s favourite game to play in his spare time) to things that will fundamentally alter the way streamers make money and how Twitch governs its sizeable slice of the internet.\n\nShear made the long-overdue and much-appreciated promise that in the coming year, streamers will finally get precise information on why they\u2019re being suspended, and users will get updates on what happens after they report somebody. The vibe of the moment was odd, though. This important announcement about an Amazon-owned platform that increasingly shapes culture across the world was sandwiched between jokes and digressions.\n\nImage: Twitch\n\n\u201cThere have been a lot of issues around this,\u201d Shear said when asked by Ezekiel_III about suspension and ban inconsistencies, a notorious issue on Twitch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard very clearly from the community about disappointment. We haven\u2019t always been consistent in our enforcement in the past. We used to have a globally de-centralised team running safety ops around the world. Because you have to remember, we have to do this 24/7 in many different languages in many different countries and timezones. You can wind up, when you have these distributed teams, with inconsistent interpretations of what the guidelines are.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, this long-awaited admission was both preceded and followed by an hour of lighthearted chit-chat. Twitch, it seemed, was trying to ape the casual, down-to-earth feeling of a regular streamer\u2019s broadcast while discussing matters very much outside that scope. It felt almost disingenuous, like the company was trying to put a friendly face on past mistakes.\n\nBut Twitch isn\u2019t a plucky little startup. It\u2019s a tech giant owned by a tech leviathan. It butters its gold-encrusted bread with the labour of growing celebrities who, in turn, now struggle with their own dissonance; they aren\u2019t regular people anymore, no matter how hard they try to come across that way. Twitch, like its own streamers, is in the midst of an identity crisis.\n\nDisaster did not strike that night. Instead, Twitch\u2019s ill-advised drink table spread, which was thankfully complemented by a more traditional bar, sparked a discussion about safety that left many saddened but unsurprised when, in the following days, two women said they were drugged at TwitchCon-adjacent parties. One of them, a streamer who goes by the handle KTLODO, said she ended up in the hospital and posted pictures of the incident.\n\n\u201cToxins came back with benzos in my system, which combined with alcohol could\u2019ve meant death,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cThankfully my friends were there for me and saved my life. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be around the rest of TwitchCon. Hope you understand.\u201d\n\nThe other woman, a streamer named Jazzzy, posted a similar message the day after attending a partner party hosted by Discord. \u201cSomeone spiked my drink last night,\u201d she said. \u201cI suffered the consequences today. Just woke up from a nap, after throwing up the whole morning and afternoon.\u201d This prompted another streamer, TheFrenchToastt, to say that she noticed something in her drink at the same party and decided to throw it away.\n\nPhoto: Annemunition\n\nOnce word got out about the beers at the Twitch partner party, drugged drinks at multiple other parties, and streamer KTLODO\u2019s hospital trip, streamers I spoke to had trouble looking at the convention the same way.\n\nThe event had been tarnished with an ugliness that belied its chummy, celebratory vibe. It wasn\u2019t just that companies and party hosts had lapsed in taking care of attendees; it\u2019s that members of the Twitch community were probably the ones spiking drinks.\n\n\u201cTo clear things up, I was at a bar with almost solely TwitchCon attendees,\u201d said KTLODO on Twitter. \u201cI wasn\u2019t at the partner party that was poorly handled. I was just unfortunately targeted despite being surrounded by plenty of Twitch friends, which is heartbreaking that it was most likely one of our own.\u201d\n\nSome organisations came prepared. The Online Performers\u2019 Group, which manages around 70 content creators across Twitch and YouTube, handed out roofie test strips to concerned clients and made sure employees had them on hand just in case.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had clients roofied in the past \u2014 even at industry/official parties,\u201d OPG CEO and founder Omeed Dariani told Kotaku in a Twitter DM. \u201cWe try to ensure that we have at least one OPG representative at each party, but some companies refuse to allow our clients to have their support staff on hand, which creates much higher risk situations. Those companies often rationalise this by saying that they will ensure safety at their parties but, too often and including at the Twitch Partner party, we see practices that increase the danger, rather than decrease it.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that traditional celebrities OPG manages like musician (and occasional streamer) T-Pain refuse to go anywhere at events like TwitchCon without personal security. In their world, it\u2019s simply not done.\n\nBut at TwitchCon, it\u2019s not just what\u2019s lurking inside the walls, but rather, what\u2019s going on all around. Both Twitch and Discord told Kotaku that they\u2019re trying to make their parties safer.\n\n\u201cWhether on stream or in person, the safety of our community is of the utmost priority and we are sorry for any concern this caused,\u201d said Twitch in an emailed statement. \u201cTo serve the earliest guests, a few drinks were pre-poured and left on a staffed and monitored table at our closed event. Although we believe this was a controlled set-up, we quickly removed it when a concern was flagged. We will continue to design and adjust our events so that attendees feel secure at all times.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Nathan Grayson\n\nDiscord, meanwhile, reached out directly to Jazzzy, the streamer who got drugged at their party and is currently \u201cinvestigating.\u201d \u201cWe always have security at our events and prohibit bags from being brought in, but given recent events, we will be reviewing and looking to augment those to help ensure the safety of all of our partners and guests,\u201d a Discord rep said in an email.\n\nIt\u2019s not like streamers \u2014 popular ones, especially \u2014 were expecting to go hog wild all TwitchCon weekend with no regard for their own safety. It\u2019s that they hoped their own communities and the larger Twitch community were maybe a little better than the ones that orbit other creative fields, industries and celebrities.\n\nBut Twitch and the community surrounding it remain in flux, and this year\u2019s TwitchCon was a reflection of that. Some of the dynamics are informed by Twitch\u2019s own policies. A lack of clear boundaries and consequences for crossing them can lead to fans not knowing when to stop. Twitch\u2019s inconsistent policing of toxicity against women doesn\u2019t cause, but certainly doesn\u2019t prevent, unsafe situations like what happened at the parties.\n\nTwitch itself wants to be both a global powerhouse and your best friend; is it any wonder streamers struggle to find a balance? TwitchCon is an intermingling of celebrities, regular people, and thousands of others who land somewhere in between.\n\nThis year\u2019s TwitchCon felt like a hand reaching out and pulling streamers up into the world of more traditional celebrity, where constant vigilance is the norm and nobody\u2019s entirely normal, no matter how hard they try to be.", "description": "These days, Twitch streaming is an avalanche that drowns potential viewers in a daily rush of new names and faces.
