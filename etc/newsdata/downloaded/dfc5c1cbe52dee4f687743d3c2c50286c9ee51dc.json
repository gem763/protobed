Haskins has been mostly kept on the bench for unexciting options like Case Keenum and Colt McCoy. That\u2019s a bad sign in an already lost season.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBut Haskins got a majority of the snaps in practice on Wednesday and seemed to impress the coaches with his progress.\n\nDwayne Haskins took \u2018major step\u2019\n\nKeenum, who is Washington\u2019s starter, was held out Wednesday for rest. That allowed Haskins to take the starting reps in practice, which is important for a young player.\n\nAnd while most of the stories about Haskins have focused on him not being ready yet, Wednesday\u2019s practice sounded like a breakthrough, according to NBC Sports Washington.\n\n\"I thought he did a really good job today, so his growth is starting to show in practice and also in his preparation,\" said interim coach Bill Callahan, who took over for the fired Jay Gruden after an 0-5 start. \"He\u2019s in earlier, he\u2019s out later, so it\u2019s all coming to fruition. It\u2019s going to take a little time, but it\u2019s good to see him take a major step today in practice.\"\n\nThe comment about Haskins being in earlier and out later indicates perhaps the coaches wanted to see the rookie putting in more preparation time. It\u2019s a positive the coaches are praising him for it now.\n\nWashington has very little to be excited about. Seeing Haskins this season would at least provide some intrigue.\n\nHaskins will start at some point\n\nStory continues\n\nCallahan said after he was named interim coach that Haskins would start \u201cat some point in time,\u201d which isn\u2019t a big surprise. First-round picks at quarterback don\u2019t sit for full seasons anymore.\n\nHaskins has appeared in just one game so far, coming off the bench in a 24-3 loss to the New York Giants. Perhaps politics played into Haskins not playing more; Gruden was said to be against the Haskins pick when it was made. Haskins also didn\u2019t have a lot of college experience at Ohio State, and it would be understandable if he\u2019s not quite ready for the NFL.\n\nHaskins will play, and maybe soon. That might make the Redskins a little more watchable.\n\nDwayne Haskins got all of the practice reps for Washington on Wednesday.
