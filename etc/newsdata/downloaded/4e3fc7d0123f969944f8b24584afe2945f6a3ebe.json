I can't wait to have a third.\"\n\n\"Willa Gray and Ada James are going to be amazing big sisters,\" he adds, \"and she's going to learn a lot very quickly from them.\"\n\nRhett and Lauren started their family by adopting Willa from a Ugandan orphanage in 2017, and he says they certainly don't intend to stop with three.\n\n\"We're not done yet,\" he predicts. \"We would love to adopt again, so I think our family is going to be massive by the time we're said and done. We've got another shot [at a boy].\"\n\nThomas Rhett, 29, is on the cover of this month's Most Beautiful People issue of Nashville Lifestyles, which has previously spotlighted Lauren, also 29. Look for the couple to welcome their new daughter sometime around the beginning of February.", "description": "If you saw Thomas Rhett and wife Lauren\u2019s gender reveal back in July and thought he looked disappointed it was another girl, he says you just don\u2019t have the whole story.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/akins-rhett-file-gty-ml-191002_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
