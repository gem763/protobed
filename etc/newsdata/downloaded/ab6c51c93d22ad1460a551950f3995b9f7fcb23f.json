How? Please read on.\n\nNow textiles have disappeared almost entirely, and tobacco hangs on in much-reduced form. (These days, the main tobacco-business force is JTI, or Japan Tobacco International, which has bought brands like Natural American Spirit and Benson & Hedges, and has expanded its warehouse and processing facilities in Danville.) While Virginia\u2019s population has boomed\u2014roughly 4 million in the 1960 census, 6 million in 1990, 8 million in 2010, and rising\u2014Danville\u2019s is a little smaller now than it was in the 1960s. This part of southwestern Virginia and western North Carolina has endured the simultaneous collapse of the three industries that were the mainstays of its many small towns: tobacco, textiles, and furniture making. Danville\u2019s comparative good fortune is that it didn\u2019t have as many furniture factories to lose as some neighboring places did.\n\nOur visit was centered in the city of Danville, which Deb Fallows wrote about here . Danville is the major city within Pittsylvania County, which is geographically one of the largest in the state. The city\u2019s population is about 40,000, split roughly 50-50 black and white. In its day, it was one of the richest places in the Piedmont area, and a major center of first the tobacco and then the textile industries. Danville was also, for a one-week period in April 1865, the final capital city of the Confederacy\u2014with implications down to the present, as we\u2019ll explore in upcoming dispatches.\n\nOn a recent visit to Southside Virginia\u2014the part of the state bordering North Carolina, and far from the tech-and-government-driven boom of the D.C. suburbs in northern Virginia and the military-based economy of Norfolk and the Tidewater\u2014we were reminded of the problems cities had even when those factories were up and running. We also learned about the way they are trying to apply the mixed blessings of a lost manufacturing heritage as they figure out their next act.\n\nFactory towns face problems when the factories shut down. Everyone has heard versions of that story\u2014involving steel and auto plants in the Midwest, sawmills in the Northwest, coal mines in Appalachia or copper mines in the Southwest, other facilities in other towns.\n\nTobacco got going in this region because of a combination of soil and slavery. The soil in central-southern Virginia is part of a belt reaching through North Carolina and Kentucky that is exceptionally favorable for tobacco. (The same territory also favors hemp, which is becoming the basis of another new industry. Stay tuned for more on that, too.) Before the Civil War, it was the home of large tobacco plantations and correspondingly large slave populations.\n\nA fascinating map at Danville\u2019s Museum of Fine Arts and History correlates Virginia\u2019s county-by-county black population in the early 1860s with levels of support by the white population for joining the Confederacy. (It\u2019s different from the map shown above but based on similar data.) The rugged Appalachian west of the state, including what later peeled off to become West Virginia, had very few plantations, low black populations, and also less support for secession. The tobacco heartland around Danville had more plantations, with more slaves, and (among the whites) stronger secessionist views.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the tobacco industry remained, having shifted from a slave basis to sharecropping and low-wage labor. Auction houses, warehouses, and processing facilities for tobacco transformed the city\u2019s downtown. Many of them were huge brick structures on the streets near the Dan River. An academic history of the area\u2019s economic evolution, Danville, Virginia: And the Coming of the Modern South, by Michael Swanson, details the way that the tobacco industry shaped the physical and economic contours of the region through the 1800s\u2014and how the textile industry, drawn down from New England by the search for lower wages (and hydropower along southern rivers), shaped them after that.\n\nThe Danville area, while retaining its tobacco business, also become one of the most important textile centers in the country. An operation eventually known as the Dan River Mills was by the mid-20th century one of the largest textile mills anywhere.\n\nA central theme of Swanson\u2019s book is how rough life within a mill town could be, for people other than owners and managers. Swanson refers to W. J. Cash\u2019s famous coruscation of southern mill culture in his book The Mind of the South, published just before World War II. Part of Cash\u2019s description is so floridly overdone that I won\u2019t quote it in full. (It\u2019s no surprise that as a young man Cash wrote for H. L. Mencken\u2019s usually florid The American Mercury.) Here is a comparatively restrained sample:\n\nThe working conditions in the Southern cotton mills were extremely unfavorable. Men and women and children were cooped up for most of their waking lives in the gray light of glazed windows, and in rooms which were never effectively ventilated, since cotton yarns will break in the slightest draft\u2014in rooms which, because of the use of artificial humidification, were hardly less than perpetual steam baths. The harvest was soon at hand. By 1900 the cotton-mill worker was a pretty distinct physical type in the South; a type in some respects perhaps inferior to even that of the old poor white, which in general had been his to begin with. A dead-white skin, a sunken chest, and stooping shoulders were the earmarks of the breed \u2026 The women were characteristically stringy-haired and limp of breast at twenty, and shrunken hags at thirty or forty. And the incidence of tuberculosis, of insanity and epilepsy, and, above all, of pellagra, the curious vitamin-deficiency disease which is nearly peculiar to the South, was increasing.\n\nThe mills\u2019 influence was wide-ranging and profound. Businesses in the area discouraged higher education and brought in workers straight out of public schools. They effectively separated the region\u2019s work force by race\u2014mainly blacks as tobacco workers, whites in the mills\u2014which reduced possibilities for labor cooperation, while reinforcing segregation. Nonetheless, greater Danville was the scene of repeated labor-related and racial strife for half a century after the Civil War, through the Reconstruction era and the beginning of labor organization.\n\nThen, during the civil-rights era of the 1960s, it was again a battleground. Despite the Supreme Court Brown v. Board of Education ruling in 1954 decreeing an end to \u201cseparate but equal\u201d segregated schools, public education and most other aspects of Danville\u2019s life were rigidly segregated into the 1960s. After civil-rights protests and brutal police response in the summer of 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. said that three places where he would focus his efforts would be Montgomery and Birmingham, in Alabama, and Danville.\n\nThe main civil-rights confrontation in Danville, on June 10, 1963, was known as \u201cBloody Monday,\u201d when police used fire hoses and billy clubs against demonstrators. A local grand jury also indicted many of the demonstrators under a pre\u2013Civil War\u2013era law, passed in response to the John Brown abolitionist raid on Harper\u2019s Ferry in 1859, that made it a crime to incite \u201cthe colored population to acts of violence or war against the white population.\u201d\n\nJust this past week\u2014yes, I mean in June 2019, or 56 years after the original Bloody Monday event\u2014Danville\u2019s police chief, Scott Booth, offered a public \u201cheartfelt apology\u201d to the city\u2019s African American community. He did so at an event honoring Apostle Lawrence G. Campbell Sr., a prominent civil-rights and religious leader, who with his wife had been beaten during the 1963 protests. Campbell has recently published a memoir, 1963: A Turning Point in Civil Rights. In it, he points out how inflexibly segregated the city was in his youth, and the aspects that have changed now: a black mayor, a black superintendent of schools, black members of the city council, and overall a city that \u201cis totally integrated, and blacks are very much a part of its growth.\u201d Like other parts of America, Campbell writes, Danville still exists in \u201ctwo communities, black and white,\u201d especially in religious organizations. But \u201cit\u2019s come a long way\u201d from 1963, he said at this week\u2019s event with Chief Booth.\n\nWhy go through this difficult history? On general principles, because it\u2019s true, and because the background of 19th- and 20th-century strife has shaped the social, economic, and physical realities of the town confronting its 21st-century future. Also, I think it\u2019s worth remembering that an imagined golden age in which households depended on big-factory jobs had its severe drawbacks, too.\n\nBut in specific, this background is significant in Danville because it helps explain a highly noticeable aspect of modern Danville\u2019s possibilities: the abundance of historic downtown structures, legacies of the tobacco and textile age, that have outlived their original economic function but give the city new prospects today.\n\n\u201cWe actually have more antique architecture than downtown Charlotte or downtown Atlanta\u201d\u2014 even though those cities are vastly larger, Rick Barker, of Danville, told me last week. Barker, who is now in his 50s, grew up in the area, worked in sales and packaging design for years, but over the past decade has become one of the leading entrepreneurs behind a revival of former tobacco and textile buildings in what is now called Danville\u2019s River District.\n\n\u201cIn the 1970s and 1980s, it was popular in lots of places to tear down antique buildings for surface-level parking,\u201d Barker said. \u201cWell, in the \u201970s and \u201980s, Danville was still a mill town. We had a mill that was thriving, with thousands of employees.\u201d\n\nThen, through the 1990s and early 2000s, the rest of the state took off in a way that left Danville and Southside behind. \u201cAt one point we led the state because we had an agricultural-based economy,\u201d Barker told me. \u201cNow, with the booms in northern Virginia, and the Tidewater, and Richmond, we\u2019ve been left out as a mill town in an ag region. And that mattered because [during the recent economic crisis] there was no reason to tear the buildings down. By that point, we didn\u2019t need parking for anything.\u201d\n\nSo during one destructive wave of downtown demolitions, Danville didn\u2019t want to tear down buildings, because they were still profitable. And during the second wave, it couldn\u2019t afford to, because it had so many other problems.\n\n\u201cWhat we tended to do was just cover them up\u2014just put aluminum on top of an antique facade and say it looks \u2018modern,\u2019\u201d Barker told me. \u201cNow it turns out that the aluminum was a pretty good protective cover.\u201d\n\nStarting about 10 years ago, Barker and others in Danville began peeling back the facades. The next installment will describe what they\u2019ve found, how they\u2019re paying for it, where they\u2019re aiming, and what this effort might mean for the future of the town.\n\nMore from this series", "description": "", "authors": ["James Fallows"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/notes/2019/09/IMG_20190605_174732_1/facebook.jpg?1568916917", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
