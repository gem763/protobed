What is happening with the Australian team is truly extraordinary.\n\nWhat has happened is not good for the integrity of the game and we all have responsibility as international cricketers to ensure the game is played in the right spirit.\n\nYou go out onto the playing field every time to win and you will do all you can to do that, but not at all costs and especially not to cheat.\n\nSteve Smith has been banned by Cricket Australia for his part in the ball-tampering scandal\n\nThe off-field stuff which has emerged from this has tainted what could have been a great series\n\nSouth Africa against Australia could have been one of the great modern clashes with two fantastic bowling attacks pitted against each other and cricket-wise it has been good. But it\u2019s been tainted by the off-field stuff.\n\nI\u2019d like to say more but I don\u2019t want to go down that route. I\u2019m looking at things from a distance and I don\u2019t know the full story. Sometimes what you read \u2013 as I know about my supposed head-butt in Australia \u2013 is very different to what actually happened.\n\nBut what I will say is our one-day and Test series against New Zealand have been played in a tough manner but also in the right way.\n\nNothing has spilt over. We will have a beer and a yarn together at the end of the second Test whatever happens. If someone outplays you, like New Zealand outplayed us in Auckland, you recognise that. You don\u2019t let it affect relationships between the teams.\n\nThis Test and one-day series against New Zealand has been played in the right spirits\n\nNo excuses\n\nAuckland was a huge disappointment. It wasn\u2019t the way we wanted to start again in Test cricket after the Ashes. Can you put your finger on it? No. To be bowled out for 58 on the first day was unacceptable.\n\nYou really do have to give credit to Trent Boult. He was magnificent. Fair play to him. But the way we batted in the second innings was the way to go about it and we need to be batting for nearly 130 overs like that first time round.\n\nThere was certainly a snowball effect. We started edging everything. They held their catches, in the case of Kane Williamson to dismiss Stuart Broad spectacularly so, and within the blink of an eye it was all over.\n\nThe way then that our bowlers came out and toiled was impressive and the character we showed in the last innings was a huge improvement but it was too little too late. We have to do that at the start of a match to set us up and that\u2019s what we will be trying to do in Christchurch.\n\nTo be bowled out for 58 in that first innings of the first Test was simply inexcusable\n\nYou really do have to give credit to Trent Boult \u2013 he was magnificent, fair play to him\n\nThey were holding all of their catches, too \u2013 including this stunner from Kane Williamson\n\nA word, too, for Neil Wagner, who bowled a 15-over spell either side of dinner on the final day that was decisive for New Zealand. He showed tremendous heart but we have to have the game plans to nullify spells like that.\n\nIf your game is to take everything on then you have to stick with that and if it\u2019s your game to get out of the way of the short ball then that\u2019s what you do.\n\nYes, there are periods when you tinker but it\u2019s an individual thing and we have to execute what we want to do much better in the final Test. As for my second innings dismissal. Well, I couldn\u2019t not try to hit that, could I?\n\nIf anyone says I played the wrong shot I will defend myself to the hilt because it was a drag down from Todd Astle that deserved to go into orbit.\n\nBut there are no excuses. I don\u2019t think lack of preparation had anything to do with it. Guys know what they need going into a series.\n\nI felt in great nick going into the match after two centuries in the last two one-day games and I don\u2019t think the colour of the ball should make any difference to my form.\n\nI have no regrets about my second-innings dismissal, that ball should have gone into orbit\n\nPink problems\n\nBut it will be nice to see a red ball again in Christchurch. We haven\u2019t had one of them in a proper match for a while now! I\u2019m not a huge fan of the day-night Test concept from what I\u2019ve seen so far.\n\nYou can\u2019t shine the pink ball and there were times when it had to be changed because of what was effectively plastic being chipped off it. They went out of shape consistently and you couldn\u2019t see the shiny or the rough side.\n\nAnd I found it particularly hard to see the pink ball when the sun was shining on the sightscreen. There was a real glare. So I think the ball has to be tried and tested a lot more before you implement it at the highest level because this is Test cricket.\n\nIt will be nice to move back from the pink ball to the red in the second Test in Christchurch\n\nI wasn\u2019t out there long enough to tell you what it was like batting under lights but the hours do mess with your whole day. I can\u2019t tell you either if the spectators like it and I couldn\u2019t say whether viewing figures have gone up.\n\nWe will have to see but I certainly don\u2019t think it\u2019s something for Tests in England because we are fortunate to get good crowds and it\u2019s light for much of the summer until 9pm anyway.\n\nI know people in the game have to make these decisions but potentially they haven\u2019t played with a pink ball themselves!\n\nGinger power\n\nThere was one pleasant distraction during the Test and that was a visit from Ed Sheeran, who was in Auckland to play three concerts.\n\nWhat a lovely, normal bloke he is. I was one of the players who was lucky enough to meet him, just two gingers having a chat! I am a fan of Ed. I think he\u2019s a fantastic musician and artist and he\u2019s an inspiration because of the way he started out.\n\nI love meeting successful people from different walks of life and finding out more about them and Ed is probably the biggest pop star in the world at the moment. I still haven\u2019t seen him in concert and I want to put that right one day.\n\nMark Wood gave him a bat and we all gave him a signed shirt and it really was great to meet him.\n\nEd Sheeran visited the team after he played three concerts in Auckland, a nice surprise!\n\nPutting it right\n\nWe won\u2019t shy away from the fact that we weren\u2019t good enough at Eden Park. We have one game to do much better now.\n\nIt comes down to this and we certainly don\u2019t want to go a whole winter without winning a Test. It\u2019s a one-game series for us now and we have to get back to winning ways before a huge English summer.\n\nIt\u2019s a big game for individuals and it\u2019s a big game for the team. It\u2019s been a long winter and to finish it off on another low note would be very disappointing.\n\nIt\u2019s a one-game series for us now and we must get back to winning ways before a huge summer\n\nIt is very hard to win in India and in Australia and while New Zealand are a very good side we wanted to come here and win this series to put our away form right.\n\nWe can\u2019t do that now and that\u2019s why a two-Test series is frustrating but what we can do is level the series.\n\nWe have had conversations among each other and asked questions of ourselves and now we will come together again and get ready for Hagley Park on Friday.\n\nWe have one game to put it right.", "description": "JONNY BAIRSTOW: It\u2019s the big talking point of the whole cricketing world so let\u2019s get it out there straightaway.
