While Fury, too, despite his youth at just 24 years of age, is open to risks in his pursuit of another shot at world honours, having dropped a close decision to Joseph Parker in his only opportunity to date two years ago.\n\nFury, having joined forces with Eddie Hearn this summer, began the contest with a positive mindset, seizing early openings to force the Russian into a more cautious approach.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

But Povetkin began to wriggle free at the start of the third, whipping in hooks before Fury could reset.\n\nPovetkin, somewhat irritated now by his awkward opponent at the half-way point of the fight, began to launch wild hooks in pursuit of an opening.\n\nBut as the fight continued to meander, Fury\u2019s feet became heavier, allowing Povetkin to set up combinations, including digs to the body.\n\nCrimson then began to trickle down Fury\u2019s left eye in the ninth, with a desperate, lunging left hook from Povetkin sending him sprawling into the ropes.\n\nBut the gruelling contest lacked genuine quality throughout, with both performances failing to instil any fear into world champion hopefuls, let alone the elite of the division.\n\nAnd Povetkin rightfully convinced the judges, receiving the victory 117-11 on all three cards, to move back into contention for a world title.", "description": "Alexander Povetkin stalled Hughie Fury's comeback by outpointing the Brit in a gruelling fight to move closer to a third bite at a world title.
