The size and sophistication of the operation however points to a state actor, and it fits a pattern in recent months of increasingly bold Iranian moves intended to raise the costs of the US campaign of maximum pressure and the Saudi war in Yemen.\n\nUntil now, Iranian harassment of oil tankers traveling through the strait of Hormuz and the downing of a US surveillance drone have appeared calibrated to stop short of triggering a military response. If Iran is indeed behind Saturday\u2019s strikes, it marks a significant step towards more reckless action by Tehran, possibly emboldened by the departure of Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, and the desperation of Iran\u2019s economic plight.\n\nEverything you need to know about the Saudi Arabia oil attacks Read more\n\n\u201cWhat is clear is that the strategy of bombing Yemenis and starving Iranians into submission is more likely to backfire than bring the desired results,\u201d said Ali Vaez, an Iran expert at the International Crisis Group. \u201cIran has less to lose and is less risk-averse.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet about being \u201clocked and loaded\u201d echoed his claim the US was \u201ccocked and loaded\u201d to response to the downing of a US drone in June. But having agreed to launch retaliatory missile strikes then, Trump changed his mind, saying the risk of casualties made it a disproportional response.\n\nNow without Bolton at his side making the case for war, Trump appears even more cautious, trapped between not wanting to appear weak and anxious to avoid going to war in the midst of a reelection campaign. His solution to the dilemma on this occasion has been to pass the buck to Riyadh.\n\nAccording to Kirsten Fontenrose, former director for the Persian Gulf in the the national security council, Trump is betting Riyadh will not want to be seen declaring war.\n\n\u201cThe president knows that at the end of August when [deputy Saudi defence minister] Prince Khalid bin Salman was visiting Washington he told senior leaders at State, DoD [defence department] and the CIA that while they support economic squeezing the Iranian regime they do not support going to war. So the president knows that,\u201d said Fontenrose, who resigned from the White House last November and is now at the Atlantic Council.\n\n\u201cSo he\u2019s probably looking at Saudi to say no no no \u2013 let\u2019s handle this another way. Really going towards and nobody\u2019s interests.\u201d\n\nEllen Wald, a Gulf energy expert and author of a book about the Aramco oil company, Saudi, Inc, said Trump\u2019s comments have exacerbated Riyadh\u2019s dilemma.\n\n\u201cIt really does put a lot of pressure on the Saudi monarchy to initiate a response, potentially a military response, and that\u2019s probably really not something that Saudi Arabia is equipped to handle. The Saudi military is is not prepared to fight a protracted war with Iran in any way,\u201d Wald said.\n\nMiddle East drones signal end to era of fast jet air supremacy Read more\n\nMeanwhile, fighting a war on behalf of Saudi regime has seldom been so unattractive in the US, following the murder of Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi, and Trump\u2019s own tweeted reminder on Monday, that the US less dependent than ever on oil flows in the Gulf.\n\nHowever, while it may be in nobody\u2019s interests to go to war, the political costs for not responding currently fall most heavily on the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman \u2013 and his response is unpredictable.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not dealing with common sense here. We are dealing with the fact that the Saudi\u2019s have to retaliate one way or the other one form or the other,\u201d said Jean-Francois Seznec, a Gulf expert who teaches at Georgetown University. \u201cOtherwise the position even of the crown prince would be seen as weak in the country and at this point doesn\u2019t have many friends even in his own country at the higher level.\u201d\n\nOne option for Riyadh and Washington is a retaliation against a proportionate Iranian target, accompanied by much signalling that it is a limited response. However, Tehran may not see it that way.\n\n\u201cIf they retaliate, the Iranians would have to retaliate even more. And we are just in an inertia of war,\u201d Seznec said. \u201cWe really are in that situation right now and what\u2019s so scary is that people all agree that this is not good for anybody. But there is nobody who can stop it.\u201d", "description": "Trump is letting Riyadh decide about whether to retaliate against Iran \u2013 and if that happens, Iranians would likely raise the stakes", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/646a7f8520898637d4a83c39e125ba80034f5d00/120_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ba2ba00adf77ed88c5cf7c6750bc1e6b", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
