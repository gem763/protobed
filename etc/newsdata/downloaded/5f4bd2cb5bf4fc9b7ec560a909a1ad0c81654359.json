Nobody\u2019s really going to say anything? I\u2019ll get out of here, that\u2019s fine, I am happy to leave. But nobody\u2019s going to say anything?\u201d Stuckless said in the video. \u201cI am going to stand four feet from a f\u2014 rapist and nobody\u2019s going to say anything?\u201d\n\nAn unidentified person can be heard telling her to leave, to which Stuckless replied, \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Weinstein said in a statement obtained by PEOPLE, \u201cHarvey Weinstein was out with friends enjoying the music and trying to find some solace in his life that has been turned upside down. This scene was uncalled for, downright rude and an example of how due process today is being squashed by the public, trying to take it away in the courtroom too.\u201d\n\nThe statement added a note from Weinstein, saying, \u201cI am happy to address anyone\u2019s questions. We should all be offered the courtesy to voice opinions and be heard and to even get answers. I am glad we all still have these rights.\u201d\n\nWeinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex. The producer has not been convicted of any crimes and is currently scheduled to go to trial in January 2020 for charges of rape, predatory sexual assault and criminal sexual act based on the accusations of two women, according to The Washington Post. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nStuckless described the incident on Facebook, writing, \u201cTonight was one of the most surreal nights of my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI went to an event called Actors Hour, whose mission statement is to empower emerging artists and to \u2018create an open space for creatives to share what they love.\u2019 After a while, a friend of mine pointed out a man sitting in a booth,\u201d Stuckless wrote. \u201cIt was Harvey Weinstein, surrounded by a cadre of young women and two bodyguards. He wasn\u2019t hiding. He came to watch young artists be vulnerable on stage.\u201d\n\nThe actress explained \u201cno one said anything\u201d about Weinstein\u2019s presence at the bar and writing she didn\u2019t initially \u201cthink it was him.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Ashley Judd Speaks Out About Her Decision to Sue Harvey Weinstein: \u2018I Lost Prestige & Power in My Career\u2019\n\n\u201cThere was no way. But then a comic got on stage and called out to the crowd to address \u2018the elephant in the room.\u2019 As soon as she alluded to his presence in the room the event organizers, the bartenders, and a number of others booed her into silence,\u201d Stuckless wrote. \u201cShe continued her set, stunned into compliance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was sitting there, and the more that I sat there waiting for the event organizers to kick him out, or for another performer to call him out, or for the audience to revolt, the more I found myself paralyzed by the silence,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe was sitting there, allowed to laugh and clap and drink and flirt and no one was saying anything. The more I sat there the more furious I was at all of our inaction.\u201d\n\nStuckless wrote she was moved by \u201call the voices that have been silenced over so many years\u201d and the women and artists \u201cwho were paralyzed by the same fear that I felt, surrounded by colleagues who were intimidated into a culture of silence and passivity.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Rose McGowan Sues Harvey Weinstein for Allegedly Trying to Silence Her Rape Allegations\n\nShe described the situation as \u201ca microcosm of our whole community. And I couldn\u2019t sit there and let him laugh. So I spoke up.\u201d\n\nStuckless claimed she was \u201cwas kicked out of the bar tonight,\u201d alleging Weinstein\u2019s \u201cbodyguards herded me out. The event organizers were happy to see me go.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn some ways tonight was a horrible, painful reminder of the power a man like Weinstein holds even now. It was a reminder that even in this time of relative awareness it is hypnotically easy to be pulled into a culture of silence. However, it was also a reminder that our voices have so much more power when we stand together,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cWhen I left the building, crying out of fury and frustration I was quickly surrounded by a group of mostly women who expressed the same fear to raise their voice that I had. They thanked me for speaking up,\u201d Stuckless added. \u201cOur passivity is poison. We need to stand together, and we need to speak up. Or this poison will fester, only encouraged by our fear.\u201d", "description": "Actress Zoe Stuckless shared a video of herself pointing out Weinstein, 67, from the crowded room at Downtime Bar in New York City.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DurB9zdLLsCIRs94Qp9cxQ--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/152bfcac721ac68ff407cafaae9e4b8a", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
