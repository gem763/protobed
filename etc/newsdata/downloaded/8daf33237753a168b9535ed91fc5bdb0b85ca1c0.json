REUTERS/Moe Doiron\n\nSo-called cannabis 2.0 - legalization of marijuana derivatives including edibles, beverages, extracts and vape pens - takes effect on Thursday, with sales seen beginning in mid-December. While that is expected to help sagging share prices, the crucial factor for a turnaround is a significant increase in the number of stores selling the products, investors, companies and analysts said.\n\nShare prices in the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF have slumped as companies\u2019 revenues missed expectations. Cannabis producers, investors and analysts have blamed Canadian regulations that have slowed the opening of new retail outlets, strangled sales and imposed higher costs.\n\nInvestment bank and advisory firm Seaport Global figures Canada needs about 1,055 stores to realize the cannabis market\u2019s true potential.\n\nAbout half that number currently exist, with about 300 of those stores in Alberta, which has looser regulations than the rest of the country, while the most populous provinces of Ontario and Quebec have lagged far behind.\n\n\u201cWe would probably give the first year a C minus,\u201d said Seaport Global analyst Brett Hundley, giving the industry performance a barely passing grade. The slow roll-out of stores \u201ccreates a real problem for Canadian licensed producers, because they\u2019ve expanded rapidly with cultivation and production facilities and have nowhere to go,\u201d he added. Lackluster results from cannabis producers \u201cwill continue and potentially worsen,\u201d Hundley cautioned.\n\nCanada\u2019s biggest cannabis companies including Canopy Growth and Aurora Cannabis reported larger-than-expected losses in the latest quarter and pushed back their timelines to profitability, blaming their woes on the need for more stores to sell their wares.\n\nRegulations for the new marijuana products market, which include restricting each package to 10 milligrams of THC - the psychoactive compound in cannabis - will add to companies\u2019 costs, said Ryan Greer, co-chairman of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce\u2019s National Cannabis Working Group, which is made up of Canadian marijuana companies.\n\nWith each province responsible for its own retail rules and taxes, the fragmented approach to regulating the industry will continue to raise costs and create distortions in the market, Greer said.\n\nINVESTORS SPOOKED\n\nOne such distortion is evident in prices, with consumer paying far higher prices for legal weed, according to industry experts.\n\n\u201cToo high a level of taxation at the inception of a legal consumer system can be a disincentive for consumers to make that move from black market to legal market,\u201d said Aurora Chief Corporate Officer Cam Battley.\n\nChallenges facing the industry and disappointing financial results have spooked investors who had piled into the sector amid initial euphoria in the run-up to legalization of recreational cannabis last Oct. 17.\n\n\u201cNow, this year these companies are coming more under the microscope by investors and people are saying, \u2018hey, when are you going to start making money?\u2019\u201d said Andrew Kessner, analyst at William O\u2019Neill & Co.\n\nThe current investor attitude reflects the search for clarity on the real long-term value of these companies.\n\n\u201cWith any emerging industry/market, you\u2019ll see incredible exuberance around it, and sometimes irrational pricing,\u201d said Emily Paxhia, co-founder of Poseidon Asset Management, which focuses on cannabis investments. \u201cFuture capital is going to expect a more prudent approach.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: A man walks past a sign outside the Natural Vibe store after legal recreational marijuana went on sale in St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada October 17, 2018. REUTERS/Chris Wattie\n\nAn investment in excess of $4 billion in Canopy led brewer Constellation Brands to report a quarterly loss this month. But Canopy Chief Executive Mark Zekulin remains optimistic about the long-term prospects for the industry.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of capital money, a lot of operating money, bringing these large facilities up to scale,\u201d Zekulin told Reuters.\n\n\u201cBut at the end of the day,\u201d he said, \u201cthe multi-100-billion-dollar cannabis opportunity that existed yesterday still exists today.\u201d", "description": "A year after Canada legalized use of recreational marijuana cannabis stocks have lost half their market value, and investors betting that the launch of higher-margin pot-infused drinks and other products will quickly lift shares may be in for a bumpy ride.", "authors": ["Nichola Saminather", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441742607&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G09L", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
