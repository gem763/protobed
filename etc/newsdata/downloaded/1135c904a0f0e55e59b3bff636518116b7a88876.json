Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., on Wednesday essentially stormed a closed-door session connected to the impeachment investigation of President Trump, prompting House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff to suspend the proceedings in a remarkable scene.\n\nThe standoff happened Wednesday morning after lawmakers held a press conference in which they accused House Democrats of lack of transparency.\n\nTRUMP ALLIES PUSH BACK ON 'QUID PRO QUO,' SAY ENVOY TESTIFIED UKRAINE INITIALLY UNAWARE OF AID HOLDUP\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try and go in there, and we\u2019re going to try to figure out what\u2019s going on, on behalf of the millions of Americans that we represent that want to see this Congress working for them and not obsess with attacking a president who we believe has not done anything to deserve impeachment,\u201d Gaetz said.\n\nThe Republicans specifically called out Schiff, D-Calif., who is leading the investigation.\n\n\u201cWhat is Adam Schiff trying to hide?\u201d asked House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La. \u201cI think that\u2019s the question so many people have, so many of my colleagues have, so many people in the press should have.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoting members of Congress are being denied access from being able to see what\u2019s happening behind these closed doors where they\u2019re trying to impeach the president of the United States with a one-sided set of rules,\u201d Scalise continued. \u201cThey call the witnesses. They don\u2019t let anybody else call the witnesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna go and see if we can get inside,\u201d Gaetz said at the conclusion of the press conference.\n\nFrom there, about 30 House Republicans flooded the room where Laura Cooper, who oversees Ukraine policy at the Department of Defense, was set to testify.\n\nBecause there was no agreement for non-committee members to be present, this \"sit-in\" created an immediate standoff. Fox News is told that Schiff did not ask the U.S. Capitol Police to arrest or remove Republicans who charged in \u2014 but he did leave the room and apparently does not plan to start the interview until the situation is resolved.\n\nFox News is told about a dozen Republicans were still in the secure facility known as a SCIF as of early afternoon. In another complication, some non-committee members brought in phones and other electronic devices in possible violation of House rules.\n\nThe Republicans showed no sign of leaving any time soon, with 17 pizzas arriving in the afternoon. Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., also showed up with what he described as \"relief supplies\" for the GOP members: two large bags from Chick-fil-A.\n\nGOP lawmakers flooded Twitter with posts from the scene.\n\n\"Adam Schiff just SHUT DOWN his secret underground impeachment hearing after I led a group of Republicans into the room. Now he's threatening me with an Ethics complaint! I'm on the Armed Services Cmte but being blocked from the Dept. Asst. SecDef's testimony. This is a SHAM!\" Rep. Bradley Byrne, R-Ala., tweeted.\n\nDemocrats slammed them in response. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., tweeted: \"This is what happens when people elect members more interested in media hits than the protection of our national security.\"\n\nRep. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., told reporters that Schiff left the room without letting Marshall or other non-committee Republicans hear testimony.\n\nDIPLOMAT BILL TAYLOR TESTIFIES TRUMP USED UKRAINE AID, WHITE HOUSE MEETING AS LEVERAGE FOR PROBES\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the guts to come talk to us,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cHe left. He just got up and left. He doesn\u2019t have the guts to tell us why we can\u2019t come in the room, why he doesn\u2019t want this to be transparent. It\u2019s the biggest facade, the biggest farce I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u201d\n\nGaetz, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, was kicked out of another session earlier this month where former deputy assistant to the president Fiona Hill faced questions behind closed doors. Gaetz was told he could not attend because he is not part of the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting the investigation along with the House Oversight and Foreign Affairs Committees.\n\n\"Judiciary Chairman [Jerry Nadler] claimed to have begun the impeachment inquiry weeks ago,\u201d Gaetz tweeted at the time. \u201cNow, his own Judiciary members aren\u2019t even allowed to participate in it. And yes - my constituents want me actively involved in stopping the #KangarooCourtCoup run by Shifty Schiff.\"\n\nRepublicans are not the only ones criticizing the investigation for its lack of transparency. Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, said Tuesday she was \u201cdisappointed with the lack of transparency,\u201d and warned that it could \u201cundermine the integrity\u201d of the investigation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDemocrats began calling witnesses for questioning behind closed doors after an anonymous whistleblower filed a complaint over a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump is accused of using military aid to Ukraine as leverage to pressure Zelensky into assisting investigations of alleged Democratic collusion with Ukraine in the 2016 election, as well as former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter\u2019s business dealings with Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings.\n\nBoth Trump and Zelensky have stated that no pressure took place, though acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor testified Tuesday that the aid to Ukraine \u201cwas conditioned on the investigations.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Griff Jenkins, Guerin Hays and Brooke Singman contributed to this report.", "description": "House Republicans led by Rep.
