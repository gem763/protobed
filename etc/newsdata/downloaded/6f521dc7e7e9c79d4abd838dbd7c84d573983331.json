However, one of the things that concerns me most is that among many young people there appears to be a misunderstanding as to what socialism is and what it represents.\n\nA significant number of our young people think that socialism is a solution to the ills of society. Some even think of it as cool. I hope they are not learning this in school.\n\nSo, how is it possible that socialism can be so popular in America? There appears to be a disconnect. For example, following the 2018 midterm elections, a Rasmussen poll showed that 40 percent of millennials love socialism. However, upon further investigation, it was found that 60 percent of millennials who love socialism also believe government should be less involved in business. Perhaps it is because the word \u201csocialism\u201d and the way we hear it in the American vernacular has changed.\n\nTo demonstrate how much the perception of the word has changed, I wonder how many millennials know that Hitler was a socialist. The word Nazi was derived from the term National Socialist from the German. His ally was Mussolini who was a Fascist. The definition of fascism is the control of industry by the government. The definition of socialist is the ownership of industry by the government. Do you see much of a difference? When words get co-opted and abused all meaning is lost.\n\nKarl Marx is considered the father of modern socialism. In his book \u201cThe Communist Manifesto,\u201d he claimed that through socialism there would be an eventual \u201cwithering away\u201d of government entirely. He called it the withering away of the state. In practice, however, socialism makes the government bigger and stronger, and it is the people that wither away.\n\nAs a Venezuelan immigrant, I have witnessed the withering of the citizens \u2014 I understand more than most what the false promises of socialism mean for the common people \u2014 especially those who lack resources; those most vulnerable who have a tendency to buy into those false promises. Once the most prosperous nation in Latin America, fourth wealthiest in the world, Venezuela voted in socialism. In the time frame between my coming to America as a child and becoming a citizen in 2004, I witnessed from afar how it went from bad to worse \u2014 reduced to bread lines and bank runs in the span of 22 years. As an American, I\u2019m deeply concerned for our future as we are being tempted by the corrupt promises of free stuff. Americans need to focus on what made us prosperous and free. It\u2019s not free stuff, it\u2019s the Bill of Rights and our hard work and ingenuity.\n\nThen there\u2019s the term \u201cDemocratic Socialism.\u201d To me that is an oxymoron. You can vote your way into socialism, but you must fight your way out. That\u2019s because socialism requires big government, very big government. Once you transfer power to the government it is very hard to take it back. You then truly have the 1 percent lording it over the rest of us with the full might of an all-powerful government.\n\nThe current presidential debate stage is filled with \u201cDemocratic Socialists.\u201d Among them are Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris. All of them are multimillionaires and all are reaching out to millennials who might think that socialism is cool. Then we hear people on the left hoping that we have a cataclysmic economic collapse so that a Democratic Socialist can get elected in 2020. What kind of ideology depends on ensuring that people suffer economically? Socialism. Of course. Just ask the people in my native Venezuela. Or Cuba.\n\nThe simple truth is that socialism does not lift everyone up, it brings people down. The annals of history are filled with failed socialist states. The successful countries have the people that are most free. Change comes from committing to morality, civility, hard work, citizen involvement, local decision-making and innovation.\n\nFollowing the Rasmussen poll, it was found that when millennials are presented with socialism, what they really hear is \u201ccare\u201d and \u201cmutual respect.\u201d They also think they hear freedom. Like the people of Venezuela.\n\nDemocratic Socialism is not only an oxymoron, it is a trap. Our Founding Fathers bequeathed to us a Constitution with a Bill of Rights. A commitment to the rule of law and moral values provide the foundational tools to strengthen our states and make us the greatest nation in the world.\n\n\u2022 Patricia Rucker, of Harpers Ferry, is a West Virginia state senator representing the 16th District.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
