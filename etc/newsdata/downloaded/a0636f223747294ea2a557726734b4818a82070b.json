Others buy defensive put options that increase in value when associated security prices decline.\n\nBut such strategies are often ineffective. Stocks and bonds frequently behave like each other due to the interconnectedness of markets and the rise of passive investing. And many investors who buy puts find that profits elude them if they fail to perfectly time the stock market\u2019s declines.\n\nNow, with stock prices near historic highs and many bonds also trading at stratospheric prices, investors are increasingly worried that slowing global economic growth will eventually push markets lower.\n\nThose concerns are exacerbated by a popular investment strategy: selling call and put options in a wager that stock prices will keep rising and options premiums will keep declining. The strategy works great when stocks advance, but it can explode like a bomb if stock prices weaken.\n\nIt did so in February 2018, when the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, jumped 115% in one day as the S&P 500 index fell 4%. The selloff was triggered by exchange-traded products that made it easy for investors to sell options\u2014effectively wagering that stock prices would keep advancing and the VIX would ebb ever lower. Since then, the S&P 500 has returned 18%, the VIX has plunged, and options-selling strategies have become even more popular.\n\nZem Sternberg, one of the options market\u2019s most respected traders, is using the low-volatility investing craze to power a strategy designed to produce returns that match the stock market\u2019s upside while outperforming when the market swoons. He does this by actively trading index options and futures to hedge portfolios. The moving parts of the strategy are complicated, but the essence is simple: creating hedges that are constantly curated to protect portfolios without paying so much money as to harm overall profitability.\n\nAs investors keep selling options, which suppresses implied volatility, Sternberg\u2019s investment firm, Lake Hill Capital Management, buys S&P 500 options and futures to create portfolio hedges at reduced prices. To further reduce the expense of continuous hedging, Lake Hill trades S&P 500 options and futures on a daily basis.\n\nOver the past 20 years, a period that includes substantial backtesting, the strategy\u2019s cumulative annual return is 7.4%, compared with 7.5% for the S&P 500 and 4.6% for the Cboe S&P 500 5% Put Protection index, Lake Hill reports. The strategy has also outperformed in market declines.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nSternberg\u2019s firm essentially trades hedges like any other options position, which requires a deep understanding of thousands of index options and futures contracts. Most investors treat hedges like insurance policies. Even when they can sell them for big profits, many do nothing because they\u2019re convinced that volatility will keep rising and increase the hedge\u2019s value.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to just buy a put,\u201d Sternberg says. \u201cThe question is, when do you sell? When someone buys a $2 put and it goes to $80, and you ask what they did with the put, the answer is often nothing, as they had no process to sell.\u201d\n\nAnyone concerned with maximizing returns and reducing risks can learn from Sternberg\u2019s approach.\n\nFor some time, investors have fretted that the traditional strategy of investing 60% of a portfolio in stocks and 40% in bonds has failed to produce optimal results. Blame it on the rising correlations between asset classes.\n\nThe growing awareness that old ways of managing money are no longer as effective may help answer another great investment question: How and where should investors use options in their portfolios?\n\nThe likely answer is that investors, big and small, should swap out some of their bonds for options strategies that reduce the risk of owning equities in ways that bonds should, but often fail to. In other words, diversification diversifies, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily reduce portfolio risk. Hedging does.\n\nEmail: editors@barrons.com", "description": "One of the great investing riddles is how to reduce portfolio risk without sacrificing profitability.
