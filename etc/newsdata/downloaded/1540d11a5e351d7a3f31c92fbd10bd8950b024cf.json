Getty Images\n\nAccording to the RBC publication, the Ural Federal District in central Russia has been chosen to pilot the new filter technologies.\n\nProponents claim the measures are necessary to protect Russia from hostile attacks from abroad. Critics suggest it is an insurance policy for the government to stop dangerous ideas from spreading.\n\n\u201cSome may have talked themselves into believing an imaginary threat from abroad,\u201d says Gregory Asmolov, a research fellow on the Russian internet at King\u2019s College London. \u201cDomestic politics and the possibility of making cash seem to be the more obvious drivers.\u201d\n\nBut for all the hype, it is not entirely clear what will change when the bill becomes law on 1 November.\n\nUnusually for a bill of this sort, much of the secondary legislation to the law is still to be written. Those legislative acts that have been written are vague and generalised, suggesting that bureaucrats themselves are unsure about what to do.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It basically isn\u2019t feasible.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s interest in the internet is relatively recent. Over Vladimir Putin\u2019s first two terms, his administration concentrated on controlling narratives in TV and mass print media. It was only after digital technologies showed their potential during the 2011-12 protests that the Kremlin began to seriously consider curbing online freedoms.\n\nNow, a group of security hardliners is pushing for as close an approximation of the Chinese firewall as is possible. To this end, Moscow has been working in close technological cooperation with Beijing since at least 2015.\n\nBut there are significant barriers to the implementation of a Chinese firewall system. First, the Chinese system is a lot older \u2013 institutionalised as early in 2006 \u2013 allowing native internet technologies to develop almost organically alongside. The Chinese system is also complicated, with filters existing on at least four levels: banning sites; blocking IP addresses; keyword blocks; and mirror checks.\n\nFor most of its existence, the Russian internet has been a free and uncontrolled environment. The limited filters applied today are primative and easily navigable by an average web user.\n\n\n\nRussia\u2019s track record of implementing digital restriction laws is also mixed. To this day, authorities have been unable to enforce a law requiring US tech giants to relocate servers to Russia. LinkedIn was switched off in 2016 after ignoring appeals to comply. But other refuseniks \u2013 not least the much larger Facebook and Google \u2013 continue to operate unhindered.\n\nAnd in 2018, the Kremlin suffered a most embarrassing defeat at the hands of the Telegram messaging app.\n\nThe encrypted messenger was defiant in refusing to co-operate with Russia's security agency, the FSB, over their request to provide backdoor keys to user data. In April, a Moscow court blacklisted the company, in the full expectation that authorities would be able to block the programme from functioning.\n\nBut Telegram's engineers were one step ahead and began to hide Telegram traffic behind dynamic IP addresses. As Russian authorities searched for Telegram\u2019s all-elusive traffic, desperation increased and they ended up turning off large sections of the internet for hours. Online shops, banks and even the presidential site stopped were all inadvertently shut down.\n\nThere is little to suggest that state officials will be any more effective this time around. But the danger, says Mr Asmolov, is that this time the legislation will do something different \u2013 it binds government officials to the idea of changing the \u201cinfrastructure\u201d of the Russian internet.\n\n\u201cPeople with no technical expertise are making decisions about things they don\u2019t understand,\" he said. \u201cAt best, it will slow the internet. At worst it will break it completely.\u201d\n\nBureaucrats will likely attempt to make \u201csymbolic\u201d interventions in an attempt to show that the law is working, he says. How far they go will depend on the reaction of the Russian public.\n\nKlimarev says it is unlikely the security bloc will ever give up on their firewall project entirely.\n\n\u201cThese guys are obsessed with the idea of a switch to filter out countries, towns, groups of people, but that isn\u2019t how the internet works,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe fear, of course, is that they will go to the logical next step, and pull the plug completely.\u201d", "description": "A Russian man turns on the TV.
