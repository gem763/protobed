They\u2019ve been missing from the last few Call of Duty games, so their return here has been seen as a welcome move by long-time series fans.\n\nA screenshot from the game\u2019s PS4 story trailer, released yesterday.\n\nThat excitement from PC and Xbox users will be a little tempered by yesterday\u2019s announcement though. While the core Spec Ops experience will be appearing on all platforms, Survival Mode\u2014basically a Horde mode for Call of Duty, available as an option within Spec Ops\u2014won\u2019t be turning up outside a PS4 until October 2020, which conveniently is right around the time the next Call of Duty game will be due.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Sony has secured an exclusivity deal for Call of Duty content, but those have previously been for a matter of days. To lock something down for almost an entire year (the game is due out on October 25) is a little more drastic.\n\nYou can see the exclusive announced twice in the video below, once at the beginning in small print, and again near the end.", "description": "The practice of platform holders securing console exclusives took a new and weird turn yesterday, when Sony and Activision announced that Modern Warfare\u2019s Survival Mode -- a mode within a mode, as it\u2019s part of Spec Ops -- is appearing exclusively on the PS4 until October 1, 2020....", "authors": ["Heather Alexandra", "Alex Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/o5h21nj62udray8efxd2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
