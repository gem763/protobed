UBS had estimated revenue of A$672 million.\n\nQuarterly production at APLNG, the biggest producer of liquefied in eastern Australia, rose 3% to 66.5 petajoules (PJ) from last year. The increase, along with a slight uptick in average realized prices, helped offset a mild decline in gas sales.\n\nAPLNG is a joint venture between Origin, ConocoPhillips (NYSE: ) COP.N and China's Sinopec .\n\nConsistent production at the project has helped Origin weather weakness in its energy business, which has been hit by stiff competition and the government's move to introduce retail power price caps.\n\nTotal electricity sales came in at 8.7 terawatt hour (TWh), compared with 9.5 TWh a year earlier.\n\nEarlier this year, the Sydney-based firm had flagged a lower profit for its energy business in fiscal 2020.
