Smith was most recently the chief news anchor and managing editor of the network\u2019s breaking news unit and anchor of \"Shepard Smith Reporting.\"\n\nFriday's episode \"Shepard Smith Reporting\" is his final show. Fox News said there will be rotating anchors hosting the 3 p.m. ET time slot until a new dayside news program is announced.\n\n\u201cShep is one of the premier newscasters of his generation and his extraordinary body of work is among the finest journalism in the industry. His integrity and outstanding reporting from the field helped put FOX News on the map and there is simply no better breaking news anchor who has the ability to transport a viewer to a place of conflict, tragedy, despair or elation through his masterful delivery,\" Jay Wallace, President & Executive Editor of FOX News Media, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cRecently, I asked the company to allow me to leave Fox News and begin a new chapter,\" Smith explained in the press release. \"After requesting that I stay, they graciously obliged. The opportunities afforded this guy from small town Mississippi have been many. It\u2019s been an honor and a privilege to report the news each day to our loyal audience in context and with perspective, without fear or favor. I\u2019ve worked with the most talented, dedicated and focused professionals I know and I\u2019m proud to have anchored their work each day \u2014 I will deeply miss them.\u201d\n\nSmith has been known to make rebuttals to President Trump on his show, especially when it came to Trump's criticisms against the press. As a result, Trump has sent out tweets targeting Smith. Trump sent a tweet about Smith as recently as Thursday.\n\n...Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019\n\nThis is a breaking news story and will be updated.", "description": ".10/11/2019 20:13:45PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/284/446ff842-c49c-4c84-ab40-fe4b395e6542.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
