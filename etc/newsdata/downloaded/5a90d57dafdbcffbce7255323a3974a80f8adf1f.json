But it weakened substantially in the days since, dropping from a Category 5 to a Category 2 storm before increasing again late Wednesday. Dorian could maintain this intensity for several or so before gradual weakening through Saturday, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nAs of early Thursday over 16,800 in Charleston County and over 6,800 in Beaufort County were without power, according to Dominion Energy. Berkeley Electric Cooperative reports another 4,900 in Charleston County.\n\nDuke Energy in a news release Wednesday said it expected the storm to cause 700,000 outages in the Carolinas and that it brought in resources from 23 states and Canada to respond \"as soon as it was safe to do so.\"\n\nMore than 1,500 people sought refuge in 28 shelters in South Carolina, where sheets of rain began falling late Wednesday in the historic port city of Charleston, located on a peninsula prone to flooding. As Dorian crept dangerously closer, winds picked up sending rain sheets sideways, thunder boomed in the night sky and power flickered on and off in places.", "description": "Hurricane Dorian, back to a Category 3 storm, began raking the Southeast U.S. seaboard early Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106109541-1567534022051gettyimages-1165828018.jpeg?v=1567534132", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
