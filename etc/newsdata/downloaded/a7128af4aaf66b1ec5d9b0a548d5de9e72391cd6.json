The new regulations, which also apply to birthdays and funerals, come into force in January 2020, and are the latest in a long campaign by the authorities against public pressure on families to host lavish festivities that push them into debt.\n\nOnly last year, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev criticised \"shameless spending\" on feasts, which can cost $20,000 in a country where monthly incomes rarely exceed $300, and urged families to use the money to help those in need. His recommendation to cap the number of guests and singers fell on deaf ears, prompting the government to enforce the curbs.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nThere is considerable support for the move on social media, as reported by the BBC Uzbek Service, but this is coupled with scepticism about its effectiveness, as well as irritation at perceived official high-handedness.\n\nThis irritation has grown since Senator Maqsuda Borisova demanded an audit of people's incomes to see whether they are spending more than they earn.\n\n\"We need to find out where people get the money for these lavish weddings, if they don't earn much. It could be illegal,\" the leading pro-government legislator told state TV's Munosabat talk show - a suggestion that goes far beyond anything specified in the new legislation.\n\n'Try your own pocket'\n\nHer comments prompted anger on social media. \"You want to know where the people's money has gone? Try your own pocket,\" read one comment on the Troll.uz site's Instagram page, while another feigned sympathy with the senator - \"her surprise is reasonable, as politicians should have ensured that the people have no money left at all by now\".\n\nMs Borisova is only the latest legislator to weigh in with draconian suggestions for dealing with wedding excesses.\n\nSenator Iqbol Mirzo, a noted poet, wants offenders to \"account for their disgraceful behaviour in the media, as fines don't work\", while MP Alisher Hamroyev dubbed them \"vulgar and brainless\".\n\n'Fees support families'\n\nBut more eye-catching than social-media sniping is the counter-offensive launched by Uzbekistan's wedding singers, who have come together to defend their reputation.\n\nStars like Ozoda Nursaidova have posted videos and graphics on Instagram to protest that their wedding fees let an army of musicians, drivers and bodyguards feed their families.\n\nSinger Minusa Rizayeva told her 3.1 million followers that her fees support nearly 150 people a month, according to Radio Liberty's Uzbek Service. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the curb on celebrations, one social-media commentator spoke for many when he wondered what Mr Hamroyev's nuptial feast was like.\n\n\"Something tells me it wasn't a modest wedding,\" he posted on the UPL24 news site.\n\nImage copyright ozodaofficial/instagram Image caption Munisa Rizayeva is one of the singers who's detailed where her earnings go\n\nReporting by Martin Morgan\n\nNext story: Tajik taxis ban hugs and kisses\n\nUse #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter.", "description": "New Uzbek rules to cut back on lavish weddings are facing public complaints.", "authors": ["News Elsewhere...", "...As Found Bbc Monitoring"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/FE76/production/_109224156_wedding.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
