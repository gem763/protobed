I spoke to him two days before the Grimsby game and was very clear about the standards, and we have to give him the fact that he\u2019s moved country and moved leagues,\u201d said the Chelsea manager.\n\n\"He\u2019s as young as all the young players we keep talking about. He\u2019s just turned 21. So I think if anyone is getting too excited about this they should calm down because he\u2019s started five games for us and what he needs to do is work, work daily, work to show within the group that he deserves to play.", "description": "Christian Pulisic has failed to feature in four of Chelsea\u2019s last five games but Frank Lampard insists there is no cause for concern over his use of the USA international.", "authors": ["Neil Keegan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/05/TELEMMGLPICT000210898976-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq900leoZVuq6ru6F43OqP_jlaTMTxUhlzF8Rkw038U-A.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
