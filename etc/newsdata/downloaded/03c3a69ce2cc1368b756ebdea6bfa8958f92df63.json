REUTERS/Henry Nicholls/Files\n\nLooney, 49, took charge of BP\u2019s oil and gas production, or upstream operations, in 2016 as the sector grappled with the aftermath of the 2014 collapse in oil prices.\n\nThe Irishman\u2019s energetic management style was quickly felt as he spearheaded BP\u2019s drive to improve performance through cost cutting and digitalisation.\n\nHe has led BP through one of its periods of fastest growth in oil and gas production, with output rising up by around 20% since 2016 with the launch of more than 20 new major projects around the world and the acquisition of BHP\u2019s portfolio of U.S. shale assets this year for $10.5 billion in BP\u2019s biggest deal in three decades.\n\nAs CEO, he will be charged with continuing to adapt BP to the transition to lower carbon energy as pressure from investors to meet climate change targets grow.\n\n\u201cBernard is a terrific choice to lead the company next,\u201d Dudley, who turned 64 last month, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHe knows BP and our industry as well as anyone but is creative and not bound by traditional ways of working. I have no doubt that he will thoughtfully lead BP through the transition to a low carbon future.\u201d\n\nNEAR BUST TO BOOM\n\nDudley will step down as CEO after the company\u2019s full-year results on February 4 2020 and will retire on March 31, BP said.\n\nHe was appointed to the top job in 2010 following the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nDudley led the company through near-bankruptcy after it caused the largest oil spill in U.S. history and through an oil price crash four years later.\n\nPreparations for Dudley\u2019s departure were accelerated after Helge Lund became BP chairman in January with a mandate to oversee succession plans.\n\nDudley succeeded Tony Hayward who stepped down in the wake of the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster that left 11 rig workers dead.\n\nHe has had to navigate a vast asset disposal to pay for more than $60 billion in litigation and clean-up costs followed by a landmark settlement with U.S. authorities.\n\nThe logo of BP is seen at a petrol station in Kloten, Switzerland October 3, 2017.
