A new series maybe? Coming this fall to #abc,\" Ripa wrote in her caption.\n\nSince posting, the \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\" host has received over 51,000 likes on her post.\n\nMany people responded to Ripa's caption saying how happy they would be to watch her \"Blondish\" show.\n\n\"Your stylist is so handsome, I'd watch Blondish,\" one person wrote.\n\nAnother chimed in saying, \"A Queen undergoing maintenance. We Live.\"\n\nWhile we are used to seeing Ripa in full glam, this actually isn't the first time she has posted a makeup-free photo.\n\nIn September, she posted an adorable picture hugging her daughter allowing her natural beauty to shine through.", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/kelly-ripa-gty-jt-191017_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
