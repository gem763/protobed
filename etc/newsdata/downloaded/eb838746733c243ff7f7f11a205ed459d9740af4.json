I would like to see the government develop a comprehensive plan to stay below 1.5 degrees [Celsius] of warming,\u201d she said to Insider, referring to a United Nations report finding the Earth\u2019s temperature has raised 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) since the 18th century.\n\nOn the pledge\u2019s website, Ms. Lim wrote: \u201cI am facing a future of economic instability, of food scarcity and extreme weather. What if I have to sacrifice my child\u2019s education to pay for a new house? What if my house becomes uninsurable? What if I have to pay for clean water? What if my city becomes unsafe and I have to flee or if my baby is sick, but the hospitals are overflowing with people fleeing worse conditions?? For many people these fears are already reality.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am giving up my chance of having a family because I will only have children if I know I can keep them safe. It breaks my heart, but I created this pledge because I know I am not alone. I am not the only young person giving up lifelong dreams because they are unsure of what the future will hold. We\u2019ve read the science, and now we\u2019re pleading with our government,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Lim\u2019s pledge is the latest in a movement of young people who have decided to take climate activism \u2014 and to them, their futures \u2014 into their own hands.\n\nTeen climate activist Greta Thunberg, 16, and other young people testified in front of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Wednesday, calling on U.S. lawmakers to \u201clisten to the scientists\u201d and \u201cunite behind the science\u201d and take actions toward solving climate change.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
