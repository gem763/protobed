The agency\u2019s August letter was seen as a move to put other universities on notice that such alleged bias would not be tolerated.\n\nAD\n\nCritics in higher education accused the administration of politicizing colleges and universities and violating academic freedom. Among them was the Middle Eastern Studies Association, which charged that the Education Department\u2019s inquiry constituted \u201can unprecedented and counterproductive intervention into academic curricula and programming that threatens the integrity and autonomy of our country\u2019s institutions of higher learning.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn a formal response to the Education Department, the University of North Carolina defended the program. It did not offer to change its programs but said it would enhance oversight of the consortium and better record how spending matches the law\u2019s requirements.\n\nThe Duke-UNC Consortium was founded in 2005 and seeks to bring people on both campuses together for scholarly and cultural events related to the Middle East and Muslim communities around the world.\n\nAD\n\nOn Thursday, Education Department spokeswoman Angela Morabito said the agency had released the grant funding for the Duke-UNC program. She also released a letter sent to the Middle Eastern Studies Association defending the Education Department\u2019s investigation. In it, Robert King, an assistant secretary at the department, wrote that the government has an obligation to make sure grant recipients are adhering to requirements set out by law.\n\nAD\n\nKing said the law requires programs to include \u201cbalanced perspectives.\u201d He said the department will not, as a general rule, dictate the content of courses and programs but will insist that the legal requirement for diverse perspectives be met.\n\n\u201cWe are simply encouraging the Consortium to offer more perspectives, not fewer, in accordance with the law,\u201d he wrote. He said the agency had no objection to a focus on Islam but wanted expanded offerings to include other religions.\n\nHe also made clear that the department is not going to relent on similar oversight.\n\n\u201cFederal grants are not blank checks from public coffers, and the Department intends to ensure that taxpayer funds are spent in alignment with Congressional directives,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAD", "description": "Agency had criticized program as too favorable to Islam.", "authors": ["Laura Meckler", "Reporter Covering National Education Policy", "Trends", "The Education Department"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fDYmrLWnhakaacZWnKSyt-4V17Q=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AOTSHIGOLII6TMU3UUUNZAQVJI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
