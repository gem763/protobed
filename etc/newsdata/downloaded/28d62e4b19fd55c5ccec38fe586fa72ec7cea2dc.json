Since I was a little girl I\u2019ve LOVED footy.\n\n\u201cPassion and love for the game has been what\u2019s always fuelled me, but the last few seasons have taken a real toll on my mental health. It\u2019s time to take a step back from the game for now and focus on my family.\n\n\u201cBell and I are hoping to be pregnant by Christmas, and with looking after Vinny and taking care of my Mum, family is my number one priority.\n\n\u201cI will get myself right both mentally and physically to pull on the boots in VFL 2020 and hopefully if all goes well I\u2019ll be back out in an AFLW jumper soon after.\n\n\u201cTo all the little girls and boys who follow me, don\u2019t worry this isn\u2019t the end, this is just the beginning.\n\n\u201cI want to wish all of today\u2019s draftees the best of luck, I hope all your dreams come true.\u201d\n\nHope said last week she wanted to keep playing in the AFLW after nominating for the draft.\n\n\u201cI just want to play footy and I want footy to be fun. I want it \u2014 especially AFLW \u2014 to keep growing so little girls can eventually one day play that full-time,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Carlton followed the Bulldogs\u2019 selection of Newton by pouncing on Geelong Falcons midfielder Lucy McEvoy with the second overall selection.\n\nBrisbane used the No. 3 pick on Maroochydore midfielder Lily Postletwaite.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely crazy ... I can\u2019t believe this day has finally come and I\u2019m so happy to be a part of the Western Bulldogs,\u201d Newton said.\n\n\u201cI was hoping (I\u2019d go No.1) but I wasn\u2019t sure.\n\n\u201cMy whole family is so excited, it\u2019s been such a long lead up, so for them to have me so stressed out all the time it\u2019s good for them that I\u2019ve finally been drafted.\u201d\n\nThe Bulldogs obtained the first pick when Monique Conti was traded to expansion club Richmond, and they held four of the first seven Victorian selections.\n\nMaggie Gorham from Belconnen went to GWS at pick No.4 with St Kilda landing winger Georgia Patrikios from the Calder Cannons with the fifth overall selection.\n\nThe Bulldogs and Cats drafted Isabella Grant (daughter of Chris) and Millie Brown (daughter of Paul), respectively, as father-daughter picks.\n\nBulldogs coach Nathan Burke told foxfooty.com.au said he expects Newton to have an immediate impact on her teammates.\n\n\u201cShe can play anywhere on the field and she will do an amazing job,\u201d Burke said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll fit into our group absolutely perfectly because she\u2019s a wonderful person and we\u2019re glad to have her.\n\n\u201cGabby has the ability to make the other players in the team better ... Gabby is one of the best handballers \u2014 male or female \u2014 that I\u2019ve seen play the game and the way she brings her teammates into the game is a epecial talent.\u201d\n\nThere are now 14 clubs in the AFLW, after the additions of the Tigers, West Coast, Gold Coast and St Kilda, but the first round of the draft had 18 selections, due to expansion compensation picks.\n\nFIRST ROUND OF 2019 AFLW DRAFT\n\nPick 1 \u2014 Western Bulldogs: Gabby Newton (Northern Knights)\n\nPick 2 \u2014 Carlton: Lucy McEvoy (Geelong Falcons)\n\nPick 3 \u2014 Brisbane Lions: Lily Postlethwaite (Maroochydore)\n\nPick 4 \u2014 GWS Giants: Maggie Gorham (Belconnen Magpies)\n\nPick 5 \u2014 St Kilda: Georgia Patrikios (Calder Cannons)\n\nPick 6 \u2014 Western Bulldogs: Nell Morris-Dalton (Northern Knights)\n\nPick 7 \u2014 Richmond: Sophie Molan (GWV Rebels)\n\nPick 8 \u2014 Western Bulldogs: Gemma Lagioia (Oakleigh Chargers)\n\nPick 9 \u2014 Western Bulldogs: Elisabeth Georgostathis (Western Jets)\n\nPick 10 \u2014 North Melbourne: Ellie Gavalas (Western Bulldogs VFLW)\n\nPick 11 \u2014 Geelong Cats (father-daughter selection): Millie Brown (Murray Bushrangers)\n\nPick 12 \u2014 Fremantle: Roxanne Roux (East Fremantle)\n\nPick 13 \u2014 Carlton: Grace Egan (Richmond VFLW)\n\nPick 14 \u2014 Adelaide Crows: Montana McKinnon (South Adelaide)\n\nPick 15 \u2014 Brisbane Lions: Isabel Dawes (Maroochydore)\n\nPick 16 \u2014 Brisbane Lions: Catherine Svarc (Wilston Grange)\n\nPick 17 \u2014 Brisbane Lions: Hannah Hillman (Coorparoo)\n\nPick 18 \u2014 Gold Coast Suns: Serene Watson (Bond University)", "description": "The 2019 AFLW Draft has been overshadowed by the dramatic decision from Moana Hope to walk away from the competition just hours before the start of Tuesday\u2019s draft.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b63f2df39925a346ddbeb410f373678e?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
