The British people still believe in loyalty to their friends.\u201d\n\nAlthough they never met in power, Thatcher was impressed by the success of Chile\u2019s neoliberal economic program and Pinochet\u2019s bloody stance against communism in Latin America.\n\nAbove all she felt a \u201cgreat debt for [Pinochet\u2019s] secret actions during the Falklands war\u201d, according to Moore.\n\nDuring the conflict, Pinochet installed a military radar in southern Chile to update British intelligence on the movements of Argentina\u2019s air force. He also provided safe passage for SAS troops following a botched reconnaissance mission on mainland Argentina.\n\nBut for survivors of Chile\u2019s dictatorship, the relationship between the two leaders is still cause for anger.\n\n\u201cFor a British authority figure to publicly support the most bloody dictator in Latin America violated the memory of the thousands of Chileans who were killed, imprisoned and tortured under the dictatorship\u201d said Alicia Lira, the president of the Association for Relatives of the Executed.\n\n\u201cHer words were an offense to the Chilean people.\u201d\n\nAccording to Chile\u2019s truth and reconciliation commission, 2,279 people were murdered by Pinochet\u2019s military regime, and a further 27,255 were tortured between 1973 and 1990.\n\nThanks to public pressure from figures such as Lira, whose husband was killed by the military in 1982, former members of the regime continue to stand trial. On Wednesday, Chilean courts sentenced one of Pinochet\u2019s former bodyguards, Cristi\u00e1n Labb\u00e9, to three years in prison for the 1973 torture of a political prisoner.\n\nPinochet\u2019s taste in tipples was for years kept under wraps by US secret services.\n\nWhen an uncensored version of a Defense Intelligence Agency profile of the dictator was released under pressure from the National Security Archive at George Washington University, one of the details previously deemed too sensitive to release was : \u201cDrinks scotch and pisco sours; smokes cigarettes; likes parties.\u201d\n\nAfter the return to democracy however, Pinochet retained the support of many rightwing Chileans. In response to his arrest in the UK, a group of conservative senators demanded a boycott of British goods \u2013 including whisky.", "description": "Detail revealed in latest volume of Thatcher biography adds color to close relationship between UK PM and dictator who oversaw deaths of thousands", "authors": ["Mat Youkee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04c24014b75de8f0d23a3f8d2d142b8c26d36701/0_59_1536_922/master/1536.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d8b89c4cdbf08701528d79cd4d5dfa52", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
