But if the measure were adopted, immigrant detainees would simply be transferred to facilities outside California, the agency said in a statement.\n\nThe impact \"would be felt almost exclusively by residents of California, who would be forced to travel greater distances to visit friends and family in custody,\" ICE said.\n\nThe average daily population at issue in those facilities accounts for less than a tenth of the 52,000 detainees ICE is holding nationwide, it said.\n\nSmall fraction\n\nThe California bill, which secured its final passage by the state legislature last month, bans any new or renewed state contracts with private, for-profit prisons, starting in January.\n\nFour detention facilities privately operated for ICE would be put out of business even sooner, when their contracts with the federal government expire next year, Bonta said.\n\nCalifornia had already been moving in this direction, terminating in June its contact with a privately-run correctional centre in Arizona - the last of several such out-of-state facilities - and last month closing a 700-bed facility in McFarland, California, near Bakersfield.\n\nThe state's share of inmates in private facilities is a small fraction of its total prison population of nearly 126,000.\n\nBy comparison, Texas, which became the first US state to outsource incarceration to private companies in 1985, had far more inmates than any other state in for-profit facilities in 2017. The number came to nearly 13,000, or 7.8 percent of its total, said Gotsch of the Sentencing Project.", "description": "Supporters of a new bill, expected to be signed this week, say private prisons contribute to a culture of incarceration.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/2d1dd3503212473bb67614de2ceb1d1c_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
