But where exactly does the astonishing triumph leave him now?\n\nThe big plusses\n\nMovement\n\nMurray says he doesn\u2019t feel quite as mobile as he was before his hip trouble. But then, he used to be one of the quickest on the tour. Now, even though he is running at a few per cent below his best, he is still able to shrink the court with his movement and extend rallies one or two shots beyond his opponents\u2019 expectations. In Antwerp, it was fascinating to see how they tried to catch him out with drop-shots, only for him to repeatedly charge forward and tap the ball away for a winner.\n\nBackhand\n\nThis is always Murray\u2019s most natural shot and the one that slots back into place quickest after downtime. From his second match of the week, he was drilling his cross-court backhand low, flat and hard into his opponent\u2019s own backhand corner. And as he was up against a man with a single-handed backhand that day (Pablo Cuevas), as well as another the following day (Marius Copil), this created a power imbalance. A single hander can live with Murray, but only if he has outstanding feel and control.", "description": "Andy Murray completed a remarkable return from what had appeared a career-ending injury with victory over Stan Wawrinka to claim the European Open title on Sunday night.", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Tennis Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2019/10/22/TELEMMGLPICT000213617417-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq900leoZVuq6ru6F43OqP_jlaTMTxUhlzF8Rkw038U-A.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
