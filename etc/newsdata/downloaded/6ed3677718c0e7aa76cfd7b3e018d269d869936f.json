He told me that I just need to focus and I\u2019ll be all good, so I felt if he was doing that for me why I can\u2019t I do that for someone else, because it may give them a little boost.\n\n\u2018I never played in the England Under-21s with Lewis Cook, but because we had the same injury at the same time and we had surgery on the same day, we\u2019ve sort of kept in touch with each other. I remember when Sol Bamba for Cardiff did his injury too, so I also sent him a message.\n\n\u2018When you go through an injury like that and you\u2019re out for nine or 10 months, football and rivalry is put aside and you\u2019re just getting behind each other. But I\u2019m ready whenever the boss needs me now, so we\u2019ll see what happens.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m happy with how I\u2019m playing at the moment and I feel comfortable.\u2019\n\nHolding has enjoyed a solid return to action, helping Arsenal to keep two clean sheets in both of his appearances \u2013 a 5-0 win over Nottingham Forest in the Carabao Cup followed by a 4-0 victory over Standard Liege.\n\nArsenal have only kept one clean sheet in the Premier League this season and there have been calls for Holding to be recalled to the side, possibly at Luiz\u2019s expense with the summer signing struggling for form since his move.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Rob Holding has revealed that David Luiz sent him a message of support after he ruptured his cruciate ligament while playing for Arsenal against Manchester United in December.
