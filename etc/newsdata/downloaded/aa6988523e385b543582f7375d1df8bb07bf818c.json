This is probably not something you want to hear if you want to talk trash with your friends while settling the score in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that voice chat isn\u2019t possible; it\u2019s just much more limited, and the process differs depending on the multiplayer game that you want to play. WhatsApp and Discord are simple apps to use if you want to remove the uncertainty of being able to corral your friends, but not everyone wants to rely on outside apps or services.\n\nWhat follows is a catalog of the games that allow voice chat as well as the accessories that make it easier. We\u2019ll be monitoring Nintendo\u2019s progress in building out voice chat support for the Switch and will add new products as they appear.\n\nGames that offer voice chat via Nintendo\u2019s mobile app\n\nIf you\u2019re playing a multiplayer game made by Nintendo, like Smash Bros. Ultimate or Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, you\u2019ll be able to chat with friends by using Nintendo\u2019s Switch Online app on your iOS or Android device. There are a few games made by other developers that are included in the mix, too. To play online multiplayer and voice chat using the app, you\u2019ll need a paid membership to Nintendo Switch Online.\n\nHere\u2019s the current list of games that allow voice chat via the app:\n\nArms\n\nDragon Quest Builders 2\n\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe\n\nMario Tennis Aces\n\nMarvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order\n\nMortal Kombat 11\n\nRed Faction Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered\n\nSaints Row: The Third (full package)\n\nSkulls of the Shogun: Bone-A-Fide Edition\n\nSplatoon 2\n\nStardew Valley\n\nSuper Mario Party\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\n\nTT Isle of Man\n\nThe entire NES / Nintendo Switch Online game library supports voice chat using the Nintendo Switch Online app.\n\nInitiating voice chat isn\u2019t as simple as booting up one of these games. In my experience, the feature is usually restricted to specific game modes, and it will only be available to use during the match. Frustratingly, voice chat will sometimes end without warning if you exit the match.\n\nOther consoles can maintain voice chat sessions throughout various menus or other game components, so the fact that Nintendo\u2019s app can\u2019t handle this is disappointing. What makes the situation worse is that voice chatting through the Switch Online app will drain your phone\u2019s battery, and the audio quality isn\u2019t great.\n\nIf you only want to pop into voice chat during a multiplayer round and leave once it\u2019s over, Nintendo\u2019s app might be just enough to help you get your voice chat fix. But there\u2019s a good chance that you\u2019ll be looking for alternatives.\n\nThankfully, this isn\u2019t the only option that Switch players have to voice chat. A similarly small group of Switch games allow for native voice chat, meaning you don\u2019t need any extra software or hardware other than the headphones you likely already own. So check out the section below to see if your current favorite game is included.\n\nGames that offer native voice chat\n\nNintendo now allows multiplayer games to ship with native support for voice chat, even if they aren\u2019t included on Nintendo\u2019s Switch Online app. This is thanks to Vivox, the maker of a cross-platform voice and text chat SDK that\u2019s embedded in many of the most popular multiplayer games, including PUBG and Rainbow Six: Siege. Just plug in a set of headphones that include an in-line mic, and you can start chatting with friends \u2014 in most cases, it works even if they\u2019re playing on other consoles.\n\nFortnite was the first Nintendo Switch game to ship with Vivox voice chat. Since its launch in 2018, Nintendo has allowed Vivox\u2019s SDK to be used by any Switch developer. So there\u2019s a good reason to assume that we\u2019ll see more multiplayer games that support the feature in the future.\n\nDave Verratti, the president of Vivox, told The Verge that the company\u2019s voice and text chat tech will be coming to future Switch games from over 15 studios. Verratti also shared that, while Vivox aims to bring all platforms and communities together with its Switch SDK, some games don\u2019t currently offer cross-platform support. In those cases, you\u2019ll just be chatting with other Switch users.\n\nHere\u2019s the current list of games that natively support voice chat on the Switch:\n\nFortnite\n\nSmite\n\nPaladins\n\nDC Universe Online\n\nFriday the 13th (no cross-platform chat)\n\nDauntless\n\nKiller Queen\n\nIf you want to chat while your Switch is docked near the TV, the $25 Faceoff Deluxe+ wired Switch controller by PDP featuring a 3.5mm headphone jack could be useful. It connects via one of the USB-A ports on the side of the Switch dock, and it lets you enjoy gaming on the big screen. With this controller and any set of mic-equipped headphones, you can participate in chatter from friends and opponents in the games listed above that natively support voice chat.", "description": "Using voice chat on the Nintendo Switch is more complicated than it should be, but it\u2019s not impossible. We\u2019ve listed the games that support the feature and described how a company called Vivox is helping to bring native voice chat to more games.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cedb78BouCfxUZ4o5eDyRwatu7E=/0x179:2040x1247/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10329943/jbareham_180301_2346_nintendo_switch_0034_splatoon.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-30"}
