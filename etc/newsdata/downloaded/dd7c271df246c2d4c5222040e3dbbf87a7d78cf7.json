The data-dependent Fed can still go ahead with delivering a third consecutive rate cut on October 30th, but will likely remain patient on committing to an easing cycle.\n\nIf we don\u2019t see a complete collapse in trade talks, the bullish case for US stocks remains in place as the US economy is still likely to see modest growth and the Fed is unlikely to raise rates over the next couple of years as inflation will probably not rise above their target over the next year.\n\nTrade\n\nTrade updates have been confusing at the very least. It seems deputy level meetings yielded no major progress, but we are still on a path to see a partial trade agreement and yet China may now plan to leave Washington on Thursday, a full day early. President Trump was expected to meet with China\u2019s top-level officials on Friday, so it is hard to imagine they will leave if a partial agreement is reached.\n\nThe next round of tariff increases that are targeted to take place on October 15th may be put on ice. It however is hard to be strongly optimistic as we\u2019ve been here before. In May we thought a deal was happening, then again at the G20 in June, but now it seems the best we can hope for is a partial agreement, more like a band-aid solution that will see the trade war eventually flare up again.\n\n\n\nYuan\n\nCurrency pact speculation between the world\u2019s two largest economies saw the Chinese yuan strengthen ahead of the next \u2018do or die\u2019 moment in trade talks. The offshore currency has given back some of its earlier gains and now trades at 7.1267. We could see the beginnings of the assemblance of a trade deal come out of this week\u2019s negotiations and a currency pact could be easy as it seems they will revisit the terms that were agreed upon back in early May.\n\nOil\n\nOil prices are rising on production risks from Ecuador, positive comments from Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo and trade optimism. Fresh geopolitical risks from Iraq and Ecuador have been providing an added backdrop for higher oil prices. Ecuador has oil production down over 200K barrels due to unrest and we could see that situation get much worse.\n\nBarkindo\u2019s comment remind markets that if oil prices do not fall off a cliff over demand concerns, we could very see OPEC + extend their production cuts throughout the majority of 2020. If oil prices (Brent) fell below $50 a barrel many oil traders were expecting Saudis and Russians to abandon the production cut agreement. Once the production cuts completely lose their effectiveness in supporting prices, its pointless to continue giving up oil revenue.\n\nOil could get a double dose of good news this week if we see a mini-trade deal support the demand side and geopolitical risks keep tightness with supplies.\n\nGold\n\nGold prices are trying to the weather the storm that is rising trade optimism on Fed stubbornness. Gold could see two or three percentage points of weakness on a partial trade agreement. The yellow metal also struggled after the normally dovish Fed\u2019s Kaplan noted that rate cuts should be constrained. The Fed\u2019s Minutes kept the door open for the October rate cut but did little to sway the needle on seeing them capitulate on an easing cycle.\n\nGold should be supported on global stimulus bets and rising geopolitical risks that now include Syria, Iraq and Ecuador.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin and altcoins are giving up some of this week\u2019s earlier gains that stemmed from the Devcon conference in Japan. A key moment in the conference occurred when the creators of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum recognized the blockchain platform was not ready for mass adoption and a reboot would take place in at least two years.\n\nFurther attempts to bring to credibility to the crypto-universe saw a small setback with the yesterday\u2019s SEC decision that rejected the Bitwise Asset Management ETF proposal. Cryptocurrencies are getting closer to getting more traditional trading instruments and that in the long-run is very positive for all digital coins.\n\nThe whole crypto-space is going through some growing pains and while the regulatory environment remains cloudy at best, demand is still growing, and we should not be surprised if we see Bitcoin continue to stabilize here.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes only.
