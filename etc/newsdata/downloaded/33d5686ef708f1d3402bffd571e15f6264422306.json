Brent is about 23% lower than its peak for this year in April.\n\n\"Next year the curtailment of demand growth coming from lower (economic) growth expectations and continuation of the U.S.-China trade war could shave more oil demand from the market,\" Citi analysts wrote.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly estimate of U.S. at 4:30 PM ET (2030 GMT).
