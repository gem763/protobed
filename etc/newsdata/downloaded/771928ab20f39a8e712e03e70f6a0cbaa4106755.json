He will only do that by playing very well for us.\n\n\u201cHe has to keep improving and taking his game to the next level, which is playing for the national side and doing very well for us.\n\n\u201cWhen that happens, we will only know with time.\u201d\n\nWilder was not surprised by Henderson\u2019s claims that he can become the world\u2019s best goalkeeper and says the 22-year-old is full of self-belief.\n\nRather than cockiness, Wilder sees his self-confidence as a positive because it enabled him to bounce back from his mistake against Liverpool by impressing at Watford .\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a confident boy, he backs himself to do well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised he\u2019s saying these words. If they came from someone else, I might have a different view, but knowing what the boy is about, I smile. I love it, I love his positivity.\n\n\u201cI love his reaction as shown against Watford and the way he will work and work to be the best he can.\n\n\u201cIf he works as hard as he can, then you never know where that can take you.\u201d", "description": "The Manchester United loanee was called up to Gareth Southgate's most recent England squad", "authors": ["David Anderson", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20574791.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England-Training-Session-St-Georges-Park.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
