GSP (reinstatement) could be called a limited trade deal.\u201d\n\nRoss is expected to meet his Indian counterpart Piyush Goyal on Thursday.\n\nThe two countries have been locked in trade disputes for months, with the United States concerned about Indian policies that mandate foreign firms to store more data locally, restrict the way U.S. e-commerce giants operate in the country and impose price caps on medical devices.\n\nIn February, India\u2019s new investment rules for the e-commerce sector jolted Amazon.com Inc and Walmart\u2019s Flipkart as the companies were forced to change their business structures to continue to operate in the country.\n\nRoss said the new rules had made expansion in the country slower for both the U.S. e-commerce giants.\n\n\u201cAll that we are looking for is to level the playing field. India is ... certainly one of the most protectionist,\u201d Ross said.", "description": "The United States does not believe that India is eligible for the grant of a special trade privilege but is renegotiating its terms after revoking the status earlier this year, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross told Reuters on Thursday.", "authors": ["Neha Dasgupta", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436540487&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920CA"}
