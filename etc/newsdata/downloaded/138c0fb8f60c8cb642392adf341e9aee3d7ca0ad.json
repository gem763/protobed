There may not be a revolution as of yet, but the chasm between the rich and the poor continues to grow.\n\nAccording to the most recent data from the Internal Revenue Service cited by Bloomberg, it took earnings of $515,371 in 2017 to crack into the top 1%. That is a rise of 7.2% from the year prior, even after adjusting for inflation. Since 2011, when the Occupy Wall Street protests were raging, the threshold to break out of the 99% has risen by an inflation-adjusted 33%.\n\nThis chart breaks down the various percentiles:\n\nAs you can see, to push into the rarefied air of the 0.1% of U.S. earners, you\u2019d need to have been paid $2.4 million in 2017, a jump of 38% from the year before. To hit the even-loftier air of 0.001%, reserved for only the gilded 1,433 taxpayers, you would have to have earned $63.4 million, up 51% from the 2016.\n\nNumbers like these explain why income inequality and the wealth tax are such hot-button topics ahead of the 2020 election. Presidential-hopeful Elizabeth Warren, with her proposal for a wealth tax of 2% on all assets above $50 million, is at the forefront of the battle.\n\n\u201cLook I don\u2019t have a beef with billionaires,\u201d the Massachusetts senator said during Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate. \u201cMy problem is you made a fortune in America \u2014 you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it \u2013 good for you. But, you built it in part using workers all of us helped educate. You built it getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You built it, at least in part, protected by police and firefighters all of us help pay the salaries for.\u201d\n\nTalk of wealth and poverty divides expanding in America come as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.95%, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.39% and the Nasdaq Composite indexes COMP, -0.83% have been clambering toward all-time highs, even as global economies are seen weakening.", "description": "According to the latest IRS data cited by Bloomberg, it took earnings of $515,371 in 2017 to crack into the top 1%, a rise of 7.2% from the year prior, even...", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT533_wealth_ZG_20191017124756.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
