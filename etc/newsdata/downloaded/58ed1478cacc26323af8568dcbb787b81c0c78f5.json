Now it says that investment is worthless.", "language": "en", "text": "Just a few years ago, big media companies were falling over themselves to bet on Vice Media. Disney made the biggest bet, by putting more than $400 million into the swashbuckling digital publisher.\n\nNow, Disney says all of the money it put into Vice has been incinerated: In investor filings Wednesday, Disney said it no longer thinks it will ever get any return on the investment it made in Vice \u2014 a company that at one point was supposedly worth $5.7 billion.\n\nVice is still worth something, in some investors\u2019 eyes. Last week, a group of lenders said they put a fresh round of $250 million into the company.\n\nBut Disney\u2019s accounting decision is yet another example \u2014 perhaps the most stunning one \u2014 of the turnabout we\u2019ve seen in digital media over the past few years. Investors have decided that high-flying publishers that once confidently explained that they\u2019d created a new media paradigm are now worth very little ... or even less.\n\nHere\u2019s a partial roll call familiar to some of you:\n\nAll of those companies have different stories and different particulars. The through-line is that a few years ago, all of them were confident that they were going to shoot up in value, because they knew how to reach young audiences by exploiting the big tech platforms \u2014 in particular, Facebook and Google.\n\nInstead, Facebook and Google have hoovered up the majority of digital ad revenue \u2014 the money the new publishers expected to get once they reached scale. And publishers that had expected Facebook and Google to rely on them for content have learned that Facebook and Google don\u2019t really need them, after all.\n\nHere are the Disney/Vice particulars: Disney told investors Wednesday it had wiped out $353 million of the money it had previously put into Vice. That followed an announcement last fall that Disney had knocked down the value of its Vice investment by $157 million.\n\nDisney declined to comment. But one bit of language in Disney\u2019s quarterly filing Wednesday is telling: Disney describes the $353 million \u201cimpairment charge\u201d it took on Vice as a \u201cwrite-off\u201d \u2014 which in accounting-speak means there\u2019s nothing left to get rid of after this. It\u2019s all gone.\n\nPer Investopedia: \u201cA write-down becomes a write-off if the entire balance of the asset is eliminated and removed from the books altogether.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve been doing the math, you\u2019ll note that $353 million plus $157 million is $510 million \u2014 well more than the $400 million Disney invested directly in Vice.\n\nSince Disney won\u2019t comment, we will assume that the additional sum includes Vice investments that Disney owned through A&E, the TV programmer that Disney owns along with Hearst, which also backed Vice; as well as $70 million that 21st Century Fox sunk into Vice. That ownership stake transferred to Disney earlier this year when Disney bought a good chunk of the Fox empire.\n\nOne last caveat: You can\u2019t say that Disney is saying Vice Media isn\u2019t worth anything at all \u2014 just that Disney thinks its investment isn\u2019t going to be worth anything. That\u2019s a distinction with a difference for some Vice investors, who have deals that allow them to get their money from the company, in the case of a sale, before other investors.\n\nIn any case, Vice is certainly worth much less than Disney and many other big, sophisticated media companies thought quite recently. And while Disney can\u2019t feel great about losing money on Vice, it will be quite happy that it didn\u2019t pay billions for all of it \u2014 an idea that seemed very plausible as recently as 2016.\n\nVice, meanwhile, is trying to overhaul itself under the leadership of CEO Nancy Dubuc, who took over for founder Shane Smith a year ago. Dubuc has been tasked with cleaning up the company\u2019s books, as well as its in-house ethos.\n\nVice and Smith, who remains the company\u2019s executive chair, used to revel in a pirate persona. But now, in the #MeToo era, the company has apologized for a \u201cdetrimental \u2018boy\u2019s club\u2019 culture that fostered inappropriate behavior that permeated throughout the company.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a comment on Wednesday\u2019s financial news from a Vice spokesperson:\n\nVice is firing on all cylinders and on target to meet, if not exceed, its financial targets for the third straight quarter. Our new executive team\u2019s strategic plan is well underway and with the recent capital raise, we will continue investing in the long-term growth of our five global businesses \u2014 television, studio, digital, news and our advertising agency, Virtue. As the media industry consolidates and fewer players control the information and entertainment that the world consumes, Vice will always be there with a megaphone for the more than half of the people on this planet under the age of 30 who crave independent world-class content.\n\nRecode and Vox have joined forces to uncover and explain how our digital world is changing \u2014 and changing us.
