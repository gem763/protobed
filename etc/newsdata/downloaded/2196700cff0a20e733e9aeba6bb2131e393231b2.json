Under the deal, Caracas is paying Moscow twice a year, with repayments in small amounts during the first six years.\n\nRussia\u2019s finance ministry spokeswoman said earlier on Tuesday that Venezuela had made its latest scheduled debt repayment to Russia. She did not disclose the amount.\n\nA finance ministry source told Reuters that the latest payment was made in Russian roubles, without providing further details.\n\nRussian finance minister Anton Siluanov said in April that Venezuela was due to pay Russia $200 million this autumn, after more than $100 million in interest was paid on schedule at the end of March.\n\nRosneft said in August that Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA PDVSA.UL had reduced its outstanding debt to Rosneft to $1.1 billion by the end of the second quarter, down from $1.8 billion at the end of the first quarter.", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Nicolas Maduro briefly discussed Caracas' debt obligations to Russia last week during a visit to Moscow by the Venezuelan leader, the Kremlin said on Tuesday, without providing details.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435909806&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902AX", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
