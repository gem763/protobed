The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe office of Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and the office of House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff had no comment Wednesday night about the report.\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\nJohn Bolton criticizes Trump foreign policy in closed-door speech\n\nPentagon says visits to Trump's Scotland resort cost nearly $200,000\n\nThis report tallied the human and economic toll of gun violence in all 50 states. The cost is staggering.\n\nOver the last several days, the secret whistle blower complaint has been the subject of an increasingly acrimonious standoff between the acting intelligence chief and Schiff, who has demanded Maguire's testimony and a copy of the complaint. Maguire has agreed to testify publicly next week, Schiff announced Wednesday.\n\nThe inspector general \"determined that this complaint is both credible and urgent,\" Schiff said in the statement released Wednesday evening. \"The committee places the highest importance on the protection of whistle blowers and their complaints to Congress.\"\n\nThe matter burst into public view Friday, when Schiff disclosed that an unspecified whistle blower complaint had been filed with the inspector general of the intelligence community, but was being withheld from his committee. That independent watchdog deemed the matter an \"urgent concern\" that he was required by law to turn over to the congressional intelligence committees.\n\nBut Maguire, after consulting with the Justice Department, overruled him, according to a series of letters between a DNI lawyer and Schiff that have been made public.\n\nSchiff said that was illegal and raised the specter of a cover up. The DNI argued it was acting legally. Jason Klitenic, the DNI general counsel, said in a letter to congressional leaders on Tuesday that the activity covered in the complaint \"involves confidential and potentially privileged communications.\"\n\nSchiff said Maguire told him he was withholding the complaint pursuant to a higher authority, but the DNI has not explained whether he was acting on orders from the White House.", "description": "The complaint the administration is withholding from Congress was filed by an intelligence officer who was troubled by a phone call the president had, according to a former official.", "authors": ["Ken Dilanian"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106131738-1568640184375gettyimages-1167616309.jpeg?v=1568871334", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
