They answered and commented. At least in Mexico, it (the series) was widely successful.\u201d\n\nVARIED DEMOGRAPHIC\n\nFormula One\u2019s owners Liberty Media have targeted a more youthful and varied demographic as they try and bring in more fans to what is still a male-dominated sport popular with older audiences.\n\nNo female driver has started a Formula One race since 1976, but women are otherwise involved throughout the paddock from mechanics through to engineers and senior roles in the management of teams and the sport as a whole.\n\nOnly three-day tickets are sold for the Mexican race, and Soberon said that allowed purchasers to bring children, family and friends on different days.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see if the demographic changes. I suspect we are going to have more women, less beer,\u201d he quipped.\n\n\u201cIt used to be a more male-oriented thing. I think it\u2019s going to be a change of the dynamic for the future.\n\n\u201cI hope Liberty continues trying to make it more than the racing, it has to be a full experience and make all these heroes more appealing to everybody. We all should be investing a lot of money in the profile of the drivers.\u201d\n\nThere has been talk of having a round of the all-female W Series on the Mexican Grand Prix support program in future, paired with the U.S. round in Texas, and Soberon said any proposal would certainly be considered.\n\nSunday\u2019s race is expected to draw a crowd of 135,000, with capacity increased from last year. That would take it close to challenging Britain\u2019s Silverstone as the best-attended race on the calendar.", "description": "Mexican Grand Prix organizers say more women than ever are expected to attend this year's Formula One race, thanks to the success of a Netflix fly-on-the-wall documentary series.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
