No Inflation! It is only the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn\u2019t allow us to do what other countries are already doing. A once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of \u201cBoneheads.\u201d \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2019\n\nWith that, Trump becomes the first president to say that he would want interest rates below zero.\n\nThe Fed has always expressed great reluctance to bring interest rates into negative territory, and during the Great Recession they opted to use unconventional measures like buying bonds rather than setting negative interest rates.\n\nOther central banks, notably the European Central Bank, do have negative interest rates, to mixed reviews. European banks have struggled to make profits with interest rates below zero.\n\nThe ECB on Thursday is expected to cut interest rates further, while the Fed meets next week with expectations of a rate cut, albeit a modest reduction from the current target between 2% and 2.25%.\n\nRefinancing the nation\u2019s debt, Trump\u2019s other suggestion, would also prove contentious and the Treasury Department so far has not taken steps to do so. The furthest Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has gone to take advantage of current low rates is to publicly muse about the idea of issuing ultra-long term bonds.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s suggestions would be jarring coming from any other president, global financial markets have gotten used to them. Neither stock futures ES00, +0.10% nor bonds TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.05% moved much in reaction.\n\nRead: J.P.
