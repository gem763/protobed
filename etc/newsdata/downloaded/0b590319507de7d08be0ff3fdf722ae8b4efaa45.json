Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company when Biden was in office.\n\nBiden is the front-runner in the Democratic race to challenge Trump in the November 2020 presidential election.\n\nTrump denies he pressured Zelenskiy to do anything improper and accuses Democrats of launching politically motivated investigation.\n\nTrump never asked Barr to contact Ukraine, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said this week, and Barr has not communicated with Ukraine about a possible investigation or any other subject. The department said Barr will not recuse himself from Ukraine-related investigations.\n\n\u201cCOVER-UP OF THE COVER-UP\u201d\n\nThe complaint, which was made public on Thursday, described how White House officials removed an electronic record of Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy from the computer server where such records are normally kept to one reserved for highly classified intelligence matters.\n\nPelosi criticized Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, for notifying the White House and Justice Department of the whistleblower complaint.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) speaks during a news conference on lowering drug costs, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., September 25, 2019.

Maguire said he went to the White House first because he thought because he thought calls involving the U.S. president could be protected by executive privilege.\n\n\u201cI think where they\u2019re going is a cover-up of the cover-up,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cTo have a Justice Department to go so rogue \u2014 well they have been for a while and not it just makes matters worse.\u201d\n\nPelosi said Maguire \u201cbroke the law\u201d by not going to Congress first.\n\nThe Ukraine reports raised serious concerns that Trump\u2019s actions have jeopardized national security and the integrity of U.S. elections, Pelosi said.\n\n\u201cThe clarity of the president\u2019s actions is compelling and gave us no choice but to move forward,\u201d she told MSNBC.\n\nTRUMP CRITICISM\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is casting a new pall over Trump\u2019s presidency just months after he emerged from the cloud cast by Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into whether he colluded with Russia in the 2016 election.\n\nTrump has reacted furiously, accusing Democrats of launching another \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and repeatedly attacking one of his fiercest Democratic critics in Congress - Adam Schiff, who is chairman of the House Intelligence committee that will lead impeachment proceedings.\n\nAfter suggesting on Thursday that White House officials who fed the whistleblower information were as good as spies, he said on Friday that the whistleblower may have been a lone wolf \u201cpartisan operative.\u201d\n\nTrump said on Twitter that \u201cthere may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her?\u201d\n\nMaguire, the top intelligence officer, testified that he believed the whistleblower acted \u201cin good faith throughout.\u201d\n\nThree House committees said they would issue subpoenas to the White House and State Department as soon as Friday if the Trump administration missed a deadline to send a wide range of documents related to its dealings with Ukraine.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees launched an investigation into the matter this month, before news broke about a whistleblower complaint that led Pelosi to announce an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday.\n\nIn a Sept. 9 letter, the panels\u2019 chairmen set a Thursday deadline for the documents to be handed over, and threatened to issue subpoenas if necessary.\n\nSchiff set a Friday deadline for Barr to hand over a range of Justice Department communications and correspondent about the complaint.", "description": "House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday accused U.S. Attorney General William Barr of going \"rogue\" in the Justice Department's handling of a whistleblower report that President Donald Trump solicited a political favor from Ukraine's president that could help him get re-elected.", "authors": ["Susan Cornwell", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434568439&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q16L", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
