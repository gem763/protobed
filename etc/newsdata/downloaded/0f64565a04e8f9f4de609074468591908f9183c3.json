It was nice to contribute with a few runs tonight.\"\n\nAustralia rested regular left-arm paceman Mitchell Starc and his towering replacement Billy Stanlake grabbed two wickets, including bowling Danushka Gunathilaka for 21 after the opener threatened to get Sri Lanka off to a solid start.\n\nFellow quick Pat Cummins, and spinners Ashton Agar and Adam Zampa grabbed two wickets apiece.\n\nSri Lanka got lucky to dismiss Finch for a duck with a leg-side catch but their bowlers had no answers for Smith and Warner.\n\nLasith Malinga's team now have little time to work things out before they head to Melbourne for the final dead rubber on Friday.\n\n\"We didn't expect that score, we were expecting 150,\" said Malinga, who pinned the loss squarely on his batsmen.\n\n\"I think for this game, the positives were only the preparation for the T20 World Cup in these conditions.\" (Reporting by Ian Ransom in Melbourne; Editing by Christian Radnedge)", "description": "MELBOURNE, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Steve Smith and David Warner's first batting partnership on home soil since their ball-tampering suspensions helped Australia...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
