If Aramco were to list 5% of its shares at a $2 trillion valuation, it could raise as much $100 billion through the offering, which would equal four times the largest IPO in history.", "description": "Business Insider - The attack cut oil production in half ahead of state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco's plans for what could be the largest initial public offering..
