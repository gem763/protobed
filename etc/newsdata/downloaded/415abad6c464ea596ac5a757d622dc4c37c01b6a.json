Just hours after Trump tweeted out that Democrats are staging a \u201ccoup\u201d rather than an impeachment, Team Trump released a new TV spot doubling down on the accusation. It\u2019s \u201cnothing short of a coup,\u201d the 30-second ad released this afternoon declares, \u201cand it must be stopped!\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s reelection campaign released a new advertisement on Wednesday accusing Democrats of carrying out a \u201ccoup,\u201d shortly after the president himself made a similar accusation amid the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. \u201cDemocrats are trying to undo the election regardless of facts, attacking the president by any means necessary, fabricating evidence,\u201d a narrator says in the advertisement. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing short of a coup, and it must be stopped.\u201d The spot is flanked with video of high-profile Democratic lawmakers including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.). Video of Democratic presidential hopeful and former Vice President Joe Biden is shown as the advertisement finishes. The spot is apart of an $8 million previous ad by announced by the campaign.\n\nEither this Twitter thread was the inspiration or the teaser for the ad:\n\n\u2026.People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2019\n\n\u201cCoup\u201d is hyperbolic, of course, but whether it\u2019s more hyperbolic than Trump\u2019s repeated accusations that Adam Schiff has committed \u201ctreason\u201d is up for debate. For that matter, it\u2019s also a YMMV situation as to whether it\u2019s any more hyperbolic than accusations from Schiff and other Democrats that Trump is a \u201cRussian agent,\u201d a \u201ctraitor\u201d himself, as well as a white supremacist, etc etc etc. We live in deeply unserious times, and all this does is just fit into them.\n\nAs campaign ads go, it\u2019s effective. It\u2019ll create lots and lots of controversy, generating lots and lots of earned media coverage, and make lots and lots of heads explode. That will generate lots and lots of overreach and demagoguery too; Kamala Harris will call for Trump ads to be banned (more on that later today), and in general everyone will go nuts for 48 hours, after which \u2026 nothing will change at all.\n\nLet\u2019s just pose two questions in response to the ad. What does Trump mean by \u201cit must be stopped\u201d? Congress has the authority to impeach federal officers, including presidents, and the only thing that can stop the House from succeeding is a majority vote opposing it. Any other method would be kinda \u2026 coup-ish, no? Second question: why did Team Trump use Biden as the final image behind the message on stopping an impeachment? He\u2019s actually been quieter than most other Democrats on that point, which is understandable considering the heightened scrutiny of his son\u2019s track record in the business world. Shouldn\u2019t that have been Pelosi behind the big ask? She\u2019s the one who crossed the Rubicon.", "description": "$8 million buy.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/trump-ad-coup.png"}
