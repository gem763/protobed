As we wrote then: \u201cEverlane does a lot of things well, but its women\u2019s silk shirts are beloved. \u2018I get compliments and asked \u2018Where\u2019s that from?\u2019 every single time I wear one of my silk blouses,\u2019 says writer and Everlaneologist Robin Reetz. This relaxed silk button-down is especially suited to this transitional weather \u2014 when it\u2019s cool enough to wear something warmer than a T-shirt but still too hot to commit to a sweater. In terms of style, this is a straight-up dupe for the versatile button-downs from Parisian brand Equipment, meaning it\u2019s an easy shirt to throw on and dress up (or down) for any occasion.\u201d\n\nRight now, said shirt (which is no longer available in blue, but in this lovely olive-green shade as well as in light yellow and mint) is just $59, 40 percent off the already-reasonable regular price of $98, making it an even better deal than usual. (Note: It\u2019s a little more expensive than the aforementioned shirt we wrote about a few weeks ago since it\u2019s made from Everlane\u2019s ecoconscious Clean Silk fabric.)\n\nEverlane Clean Silk Relaxed Shirt, Covert Green $59 (was $98, now 40% off) $59 at Everlane Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
