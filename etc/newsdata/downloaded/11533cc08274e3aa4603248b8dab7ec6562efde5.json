But they have yet to hear from the whistleblower who sparked the probe - and may never do.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump listens to questions during a joint news conference with Italy's President Sergio Mattarella in the East Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., October 16, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nIn the end, it may not matter, some Democratic lawmakers said, because the other officials who have testified, Trump\u2019s own statements, a trove of texts between top U.S. diplomats, and other White House documents have largely substantiated the whistleblower\u2019s complaint that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden.\n\nTalks between lawyers for the whistleblower and representatives of the House of Representatives and Senate committees that want to question the intelligence official have all but deadlocked, three sources familiar with the negotiations told Reuters.\n\nLawyers for the official have voiced concern about the person\u2019s safety and that testifying in person to congressional aides could expose the person\u2019s identity. They have attributed some of that concern to statements by Trump, who calls the inquiry a sham and has suggested the whistleblower committed treason.\n\nU.S. officials told Reuters last week that the government was providing security for the whistleblower.\n\nAt first, the negotiations focussed on proposals that would allow the whistleblower to testify but away from Capitol Hill and with face and voice obscured, two of the sources said. But the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers remained concerned that those precautions might not be enough to protect their client\u2019s anonymity.\n\nA proposal was made for the whistleblower to answer questions in writing, the two sources said, and House aides accepted it in principle.\n\nRepublican and Democratic sources both say, however, that members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are insistent that they be allowed to interview the whistleblower, ideally face to face, although possibly under conditions that would still shield the person\u2019s identity.\n\nThere are no immediate signs that the standoff will be resolved anytime soon, said one of the sources, a congressional official with direct knowledge of the discussions. Democrats are under pressure to move quickly with their investigation amid Trump allegations that his political opponents are using it to oust him from office or derail his re-election effort in 2020.\n\nDIFFERENT VANTAGE POINTS\n\nDemocrats began the impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24 following the disclosure that the whistleblower had lodged a complaint about a July 25 phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden, a leading contender for the Democratic nomination in 2020, and his son Hunter, who had business interests in Ukraine.\n\nIn the complaint since made public, the whistleblower said the information about the call came from White House officials.\n\nAfter the whistleblower\u2019s complaint emerged, the person quickly became seen as a crucial figure in the drama.\n\nBut the whistleblower has faded into the background as more details confirming the person\u2019s account have emerged. The impeachment inquiry now has the White House\u2019s rough transcript of the phone call, texts between Trump\u2019s former envoy to Ukraine, his ambassador to the European Union and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and the accounts of other witnesses.\n\n\u201cNot each of the witnesses have had the same vantage point. But in their own ways, every story we\u2019ve heard is consistent with that basic narrative,\u201d Democratic Representative Tom Malinowski told Reuters on Wednesday.\n\nAdam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, says the impeachment inquiry already has the evidence it needs to show that Trump abused his power by conditioning a White House meeting with Zelenskiy on his Ukrainian counterpart\u2019s readiness to investigate the Bidens.\n\nSchiff has also said that because Trump released the rough transcript of his call with Zelenskiy, congressional investigators do not need to speak to the whistleblower.\n\nThat transcript has been bolstered by the testimony of a series of witnesses over the past two weeks. So far, lawmakers and staff from three congressional committees have interviewed at least five witnesses and gathered nearly 50 hours of testimony. Additional interviews are planned in the coming days.\n\nThe witnesses have provided detailed accounts of events in the weeks before and after the July 25 call between Trump and Zelenskiy.\n\nThe inquiry has focussed on Giuliani\u2019s role in digging up dirt on Biden, the firing in May of then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, and the outsized role in dealings with Ukraine of officials with close ties to Trump.", "description": "Democratic lawmakers leading an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump have heard days of testimony from a parade of senior government officials.
