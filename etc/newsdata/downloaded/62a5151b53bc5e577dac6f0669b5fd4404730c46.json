There have been \u2013 mostly anonymous \u2013 warnings from Brexiteers that there will be \u201cserious civil unrest\u201d if they are not permitted to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Despite the deeply unpleasant nature of some public discourse \u2013 with conscientious public servants vilified as traitors and saboteurs, and government threatening to ignore acts of parliament \u2013 the UK remains a long way from a public breakdown of law and order. We are nowhere near even the sporadic violent protests by the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) in France, which are now largely spent.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In the 1950s, he was driven to fury by what he saw as treacherous anti-British agitators like Egypt\u2019s Colonel Nasser, who \u201cstole\u201d \u201cour\u201d Suez Canal, or \u201ccommunist terrorists\u201d like Jomo Kenyatta, who determined to transform Kenya from a British colony to an independent republic. His anger took the form of shouting at my mother and me, and occasionally of throwing missiles at the radio.\n\nToday, the line between that private anger and a public outburst is less distinct than it was. Those shouting at the television can \u2013 and do \u2013 take to social media. Some with an axe to grind hide behind anonymous avatars to troll their chosen hate figures.\n\nThis is very nasty, and it can foreshadow worse. But we cannot allow the fear of horrendous but rare incidents to make us behave as if mass political violence is commonplace.\n\nDespite being the leader of the main explicitly pro-Remain party for two years, I encountered none of the physical aggression \u2013 such as spitting in the streets \u2013 which my colleagues and I experienced in the early years of the coalition.\n\nMany MPs have long had to put up with abuse \u2013 in my case, the episodes of vandalism, hate mail, even occasional excrement through the door that have punctuated my political career even in a generally very sedate part of suburban London.\n\nMany women MPs have had a much rougher time as the targets of cowardly men who express their inadequacy through very nasty misogyny. The same goes for BAME MPs and vile racism. What they have been on the receiving end of is abhorrent, and the perpetrators must be pursued and prosecuted. But the Brexiteers cannot get away with telling us that these incidents mean widespread violence on behalf of 17.4 million (mostly quite old) Leave voters is just around the corner.\n\nA much more credible and serious threat to the public than Brexiteer outrage are the violent extremists incubated by fringe political groups. Until recently Islamic militants were the main threat. Now, according to the security services, right-wing racist groups are becoming a more imminent danger. The danger now is that people on this dark fringe might talk themselves into violence \u2013 and the example of Jo Cox shows us where this kind of violence can lead.\n\nBrexit has undoubtedly fuelled extreme nationalism and xenophobia, and there has been a rise in reported hate crime. Yet we must keep in perspective the fact that many black and Asian Britons experienced much worse in the wake of Powell\u2019s \u201cRivers of Blood\u201d speech and subsequent eruptions of racism. More recently, there has been a general uptick in Islamophobia.\n\nBut memories are short. The UK has seen much more serious civil unrest than anything that is apparent today: the miners\u2019 strike and Orgreave; the Poll Tax riots; Toxteth and Brixton; and, within the last decade, the 2011 riots in Croydon, Tottenham and elsewhere. And that\u2019s ignoring the deadly political violence of the Troubles, which claimed well over 3000 lives.\n\nThis amnesia is, of course, exactly what Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings want to exploit. The threat of violence is a cynical excuse to short-circuit the processes of law and parliament by insisting that the government needs to defuse a \u201cnational emergency\u201d. They aren\u2019t the first to try this: I recall Theresa May warning that there would be riots if we were to have a confirmatory referendum. If so, they would be the first protests in history against the outrage of being given a vote.\n\nPrecedent suggests that some measure of unrest would be more likely if the prime minister\u2019s brinkmanship badly disrupts our food, medical and fuel supplies. Two million young people who have joined the electoral register since 2016, and the several million people \u2013 mainly students \u2013 who were missed off it in 2016 would have particular cause for protest.\n\nWhatever Johnson says, Brexit will not be resolved by banging the table, or by frightening people with the idea that 17.4 million righteous, frustrated, Brexiters will take the law into their own hands in a very unevenly matched national punch-up with the 29 million people who didn\u2019t vote to leave the EU. They won\u2019t.\n\nIn the absence of a parliamentary majority either for the original withdrawal agreement, or for the prime minister\u2019s latest \u201cborder zone\u201d deal \u2013 less than a week old, and already all but dismissed \u2013 there remains only one sensible way to end the impasse: a confirmatory referendum on whichever deal the EU will accept, with the alternative option being to Remain.\n\nWhatever the outcome, I have no doubt that the public would insist on a peaceful and respectful debate and put the hate-peddlers to shame.\n\nSir Vince Cable MP was leader of the Liberal Democrats between 2017-2019 and is a former secretary of state for business, innovation and skills", "description": "In a packed tent at the Festival of Ideas at Kenwood, a member of the alarmed audience recently put to me a chilling question: how far does the language of political violence result in actual violence?", "authors": ["Vince Cable"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/15/10/boris-cummings.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
