Below, they dispense advice you can use whether you\u2019re traveling with a buddy, a group or on your own.\n\n1. Before you depart, join Facebook groups tailored to your community, destination or specific interests.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve traveled a lot throughout Southeast Asia, and there\u2019s a group dedicated to people of color (it\u2019s called Blackpackers Southeast Asia) who are traveling or even better, living in the area. Whenever I pop into a new country, I write a little blurb letting the group know I\u2019m in town and see if anyone is around for a coffee or drink. It\u2019s also a great resource to have in case you find yourself in a sticky situation so you can reach out for help. You will almost always get a response from someone wanting to help or willing to point you in the right direction.\u201d \u2014 Ren\u00e9e Cherez\n\n2. Consider staying in a hostel or other accommodations with shared spaces.\n\n\u201cDo the research and be sure to read reviews. Go with a spot that speaks to you and you\u2019re bound to bump into like-minded travelers. Plus, hostels are usually super affordable and often host fun events for guests that make it easy to mingle.\u201d \u2015 Anne Marie Crosthwaite\n\n... But if you feel unsafe, know it\u2019s OK to find somewhere else to stay\n\n\u201cMost of the friends I have met on the road, I\u2019ve met while staying in hostels. It is probably the most tried-and-true way of making friendships while on the road. With that said, I found on some occasions hostels were a bit isolating for me as a black woman. I wouldn\u2019t swear them off, but I would encourage being comfortable enough to leave a hostel if you ever feel uneasy. This applies to any situation that may cause you to feel uncomfortable. I\u2019ve done this a bunch of times and always ended up in a better environment with accepting people.\u201d \u2014 Cherez\n\n3. And if you\u2019re a woman, you might want to choose a female-only hostel dorm.\n\nKlaus Vedfelt via Getty Images Staying in a hostel can be a fun way to meet fellow travelers. Choosing a female-only hostel or dorm area can make it a safer experience.\n\n\u201cI tend to feel a lot safer in such rooms, and they\u2019re generally cleaner, calmer and more communal. There\u2019s also a higher chance to meet other solo female travelers or female friends who are traveling in small groups who you can connect with and plan a day\u2019s itinerary with. Some of my most memorable and fascinating solo travel friendships came out of these rooms.\u201d \u2015 Atikah Amalina, The Tudung Traveller\n\n4. Sit in public or common areas when you\u2019re reading, journaling, eating or having coffee.\n\n\u201cTo make new connections with new people, you have to make yourself available to be connected with. This can be done by just having a coffee at a local coffee shop, reading down in the hotel lounge or eating in the hostel communal kitchen. I have made a lot of friends this way. It starts with a friendly smile, then a conversation and next thing you know, you are road-tripping with them two years later when they come to visit you. Now you know that people that sit in social areas often wouldn\u2019t mind making a new friend either.\u201d \u2015 Eamon Wood of the Wayward Wheeler\n\n5. Don\u2019t be afraid to invite someone to join you for an activity or ask if you can tag along with them.\n\n\u201cFollow your instincts and be a \u2018yes\u2019 person. Say yes to an invite, say yes to inviting someone. I know not everyone is extroverted \u2014 myself included \u2014 but saying yes opens up a wonderful amount of experiences and connections.\u201d \u2014 Wood\n\n6. Take a class in something you already love to do.\n\n\u201cDo you like to dance? Are you into yoga? If so, this is an entertaining (and safe) way to meet new people interested in doing things you like to do. You can easily find out by googling \u2018salsa classes\u2019 or \u2018yoga classes\u2019 or by keeping an eye out for signs on bulletin boards in coffee shops or posted in the windows of businesses. You could ask around at any bars or coffee shops about salsa nights at lounges or bars in the area. You can also put out feelers in a Facebook group dedicated to the country you are in.\u201d \u2015 Cherez\n\n7. Or get out of your comfort zone by trying a new activity.\n\n\u201cWhen you feel safe in a destination, part of the joy of traveling is to get out and try new things and discover new interests, people or places. Booking a plane ticket and going somewhere new is the first step, but don\u2019t just exhaust yourself and stay alone in your hotel or hostel. Go to the hostel bar alone, go to a drag show and meet the performers (that\u2019s one of my top LGBTQ travel tips, actually), join a bungee-jumping excursion or try something new.\u201d \u2014 Adam Groffman of Travels of Adam\n\n8. Go on a walking tour of the city or town.\n\nWestend61 via Getty Images Activities such as walking tours are often inexpensive and easy ways to connect with other travelers.\n\n\u201cWalking tours are usually tip-based, advertised heavily and the best way to be introduced to a new place. Hence many travelers turn up to these at the same time! Make the most of this and you\u2019ll be able to easily strike up small talk with the other tourists as you go around. Why not suggest doing something together after and taking it from there?\u201d \u2014 Alice Teacake of Teacake Travels\n\n9. Find out where other travelers hang out.\n\n\u201cI backpacked solo across Asia for eight months, and every country I went to had a mecca of sorts for travelers. For example, in Bangkok, if you\u2019re looking for travel buddies, head down to Khao San Road, or if you\u2019re in Kathmandu, check out the bars in Central Thamel. How to determine where these magical spots are hiding? Easy. Snag a copy of the most recent Lonely Planet guidebook for that city or country. They are incredibly accurate about these things and full of other useful tips \u2014 I get one for every new country I go to.\u201d \u2014 Crosthwaite\n\n10. Or figure out where the locals go.\n\n\u201cMy favorite way to do this is by talking to local taxi drivers, shop owners, my hostel or Airbnb host or just by wandering around. Especially when in more remote places, it\u2019s highly likely that someone will ask you where you\u2019re from and the conversation will go from there \u2014 often one that will lead you to the best local sights, stories, and maybe even gain you a new friend.\u201d \u2014 Crosthwaite\n\n11. Use an app like Tourlina to connect with other female travelers.\n\n\u201cLooking for awesome women to hang out with if you\u2019re a solo female traveler? Tourlina is just like Tinder, but only for making friends who are local or traveling too! You can see if you have similar interests, match, then take it from there.\u201d \u2015 Teacake\n\n12. Sign up for a nightlife tour.\n\nGeorgijevic via Getty Images A nightlife tour can give you a taste of the city after dark.\n\n\u201cThis allows me to have a drink or two with a group of people and better scope out my surroundings to see where I feel safe and comfortable. It\u2019s also easy to make new friends on the tour who\u2019ll let you accompany them after the official program ends.\u201d \u2014 Jen Ruiz of Jen on a Jet Plane\n\n13. Volunteer to give back to the local community.\n\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re traveling for one week or one year, volunteering is the perfect way to use your skills while also making an impact. It not only gives you a better understanding of the culture, but it also connects you with other travelers who share similar values!\n\nSign up in advance on a website like Workaway and explore opportunities available in the countries you\u2019ll be visiting. During my year in Latin America, I volunteered in earthquake relief and with children in after-school programs. I met one of my closest friends when we both worked at a summer camp in Quito, Ecuador. We lived together for three weeks, and when the program was over, traveled onward for nine weeks in Colombia.\u201d \u2014 Asia Dawn Simonelli\n\n14. Use dating apps safely and wisely.\n\n\u201cI know I know, using dating apps to meet people abroad while you\u2019re traveling solo may not sound \u2018cool\u2019 or safe. But I\u2019ve used them with good intentions and in smart ways numerous times, and have ended up getting awesome insider tips and tours, tons of new friends (both locals and travelers), and even some make-shift photographers!\n\n\u201cI usually use Tinder because it\u2019s the most universal dating app, and I make sure to write on my bio something like, \u2018World traveler looking to hear insights, tips and stories from locals or other travelers!\u2019 Of course, with the casual disclaimer, \u2018NOT LOOKING FOR HOOK UPS\u2019 at the end, and maybe a shout out to my Instagram.\u201d \u2015 Ramos\n\n... And if you do decide to meet someone from an app IRL, choose a public place.\n\n\u201cAs a gay man, I\u2019ve used Grindr when traveling to get a tour from a local of Manchester, England\u2019s gayborhood; in Amman, Jordan, I used it to get a recommendation for an LGBTQ hotspot in the city; and in Prague, I used it to make a friend to visit the Pride parade with! Just use caution and make sure to meet new people in public places as often as possible, trust your instincts and feel free to always say no.\u201d \u2014 Groffman", "description": "Advice on how to meet people on a trip, whether you're traveling solo or on vacation with friends.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter", "Huffpost Life"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d929b872200005200db9122.jpeg?cache=EdNYgxOmij&ops=1778_1000"}
