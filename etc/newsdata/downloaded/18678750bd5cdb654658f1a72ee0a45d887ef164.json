(Picture: ITV)\n\nNorris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) delighted fans in Coronation Street last night when he turned up in the Rovers to surprise Ken Barlow (William Roache) on his 80th birthday.\n\nAfter a long absence from the soap after actor Malcom suffered a heart attack in December 2017, his character Norris made a brief return to Corrie earlier this year, before emotional scenes back in June saw Norris say goodbye again and leave his beloved community behind.\n\nNow he has returned to Coronation Street once again, but where has Norris been and is he back for good this time?\n\nWhere has Norris Cole been?\n\nThe Corrie legend, who first appeared on the soap back in 1994, bid an emotional goodbye to the Cobbles back in June 2019, when his storyline saw him leave Weatherfield to move to Scotland.\n\nNorris\u2019 decision to move up to Edinburgh came after he returned to the soap dramatically back in May and told his wife Mary that he wanted a divorce because he is in love with Freda Burgess (Ali Brigg) and that they are engaged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Freda lives in Edinburgh, Norris left Weatherfield in order to get married and live with her there and has presumably been living up in Scotland ever since.\n\nIs Norris Cole returning to Coronation Street for good?\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been confirmed if Martin Hebden\u2019s return to Corrie is just a one-off on this occasion.\n\nHowever soap bosses have certainly left the door open for Norris to return on a permanent basis.\n\nFans were as delighted as Ken Barlow to see Norris back on Corrie (Picture: ITV)\n\nShow boss Iain MacLeod told Metro.co.uk back in June: \u2018One hundred per cent Norris is not leaving the show. We just thought that given the circumstances given we find ourselves in it made sense to put a family in number three but it\u2019s certainly not the end of Norris. On both our parts we hope to have him back for good.\u2019\n\nMORE: How long has Malcolm Hebden played Norris in Coronation Street and what else has he been in?\n\nMORE: Norris Cole\u2019s story so far on Coronation Street\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Malcolm Hebden returned to Coronation Street last night when Norris Cole turned up in the Rovers to surprise Ken Barlow on his birthday.", "authors": ["Rachael Martin"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/09_10_coro_ken_norris_1st_ep_01-8188_1570630226.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
