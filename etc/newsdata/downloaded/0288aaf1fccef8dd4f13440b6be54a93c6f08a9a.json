For those wanting to influence big changes, he said keeping an open mind is paramount.\n\n\"The first thing I learned on this journey is if you want to be part of something that addresses big topics around the world, you have to be open and listen to other people,\" he said.\n\n\"Listening is not enough \u2013 it's more trying to understand others' opinions. Over the last 10 to 15 years, I've worked really hard on myself to be open and understand why people argue in different direction to my own conviction.\"\n\nHowever, being open to other people's ideas doesn't mean compromising your own values, he noted.\n\n\"Being more open to another opinion doesn't mean you have to give up your own, but it adds a lot to your view of the world. I'm totally convinced that this gives you an advantage, because you might be able to see things earlier than other people \u2013 and you'll have more time to react (to new challenges).\"\n\nHaving an open mind is still influencing Schwarzenbauer's approach but in order to tackle one of the auto sector's biggest issues \u2013 working toward zero emissions and addressing climate change \u2013 the executive said he sometimes needs to reject a flexible approach.\n\n\"I'm on a journey \u2013 I never liked black and white answers because between black and white are so many great colors,\" he said. \"With the challenges we are facing right now, for the first time in my life we are now in a black and white situation. We either take the 'white' approach and lead this transformation, or we take the 'black' one and we fail \u2013 for me failure is not an option.\"\n\nDelivering change at BMW, which has a huge number of employees, has been difficult, Schwarzenbauer added.\n\n\"As long as the current system works well, it's extremely complicated for us to make changes,\" he explained. \"I've dedicated my life to really make these changes within big corporations \u2013 we are company with 130,000 employees, and to get them all on board we've had to fight a lot.\"\n\nOne of the ways he worked to overcome this was by starting the \"BMW Accelerator\" program, which Schwarzenbauer said has been particularly popular among younger employees. The initiative asks all employees to come up with ideas that can help the company deliver value to society.", "description": "Speaking at the One Young World conference in London on Wednesday, Peter Schwarzenbauer, an outgoing member of BMW Group's board, discussed the values that led to his success.", "authors": ["Chloe Taylor"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106198712-1571845721385p90191299_highres_peter-schwarzenbauer.jpg?v=1571845862", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
