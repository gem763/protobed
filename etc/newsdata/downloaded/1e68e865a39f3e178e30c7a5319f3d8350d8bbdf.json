Tomorrow should be quite nice as we head back to work and school, before summer heat and storm chances return Wednesday. The rest of the workweek is noticeably cooler, but other details depend on the exact track of Dorian as it moves north.\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device. Click here to find out how.\n\nToday (Labor Day): A warmer and muggier feel to our Labor Day, as light winds from the south push highs to the mid- to upper 80s under partly sunny skies. And with the moderate to high humidity (dew points in the upper 60s to near 70), we could see a few showers or thundershowers, mainly after 4 p.m. or so as a weak front approaches from the northwest. Confidence: Medium\n\nTonight: We\u2019ll hold onto the chance of a few showers or thundershowers into the evening hours. Partly to mostly cloudy skies persist overnight with lows in the upper 60s to low 70s. Confidence: Medium\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for the latest updates.

The humidity comes down just a bit (dew points in the mid-60s) with light winds from the north-northeast, as highs reach the mid-80s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTomorrow night: The evening sees mostly clear skies, but clouds may increase overnight as high pressure moves away to our northeast. Light winds from the south increase the humidity again as well, with lows in the upper 60s to low 70s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nWinds from the south and southwest on Wednesday crank up the heat and humidity, with partly sunny skies and highs in the low to mid-90s. Our next cold front brings a chance of showers and storms Wednesday afternoon into the evening, before dropping Wednesday-night lows into the cooler 60s. Confidence: Low-Medium\n\nAs we often see in September, temperatures drop significantly behind the cold front, with Thursday through Sunday highs in the 70s to low 80s. While we probably won\u2019t see a major impact from Dorian in the D.C. area, unless the track shifts significantly to the west, we could see some showers and gusty breezes Thursday into Friday if it tracks close enough to the Mid-Atlantic coast. It\u2019s early, but right now the weekend is looking mostly dry. Confidence: Low-Medium\n\n[Will Hurricane Dorian affect the Mid-Atlantic and Washington?]", "description": "We're warmer and muggier today, but Wednesday looks like the hottest day of the week, before a cooler late week.", "authors": ["Dan Stillman", "Meteorologist", "Editor For The Capital Weather Gang", "September At Am", "Dan Stillman Is A Meteorologist", "Editor For The Capital Weather Gang.
