Kahele, meanwhile, raised more than $300,000 between June and September, according to Open Secrets.\n\nGabbard's video message highlighted her history in the Army National Guard, deploying twice to the Middle East, and her political history. She also highlighted her anti-interventionist platform.\n\nI'm so grateful to the people of Hawai\u02bbi for allowing me to serve you in Congress for the last 7 years.

Her district includes rural and suburban Oahu, all of Maui County, Hawaii County and Kauai County.\n\nWhile Gabbard has been polling in the low single digits nationally, she was one of the 12 Democrats to clear the fundraising and polling thresholds for the October debate.\n\nShe drew national attention this past week after Hillary Clinton said Russians were \"grooming\" a candidate for a third-party presidential run. While Clinton didn't specifically mention Gabbard, Gabbard immediately fought back, calling Clinton the \"queen of warmongers.\" And on CBSN last week, Gabbard said, \"Come on, let's be real here. Look at every single headline that's come out of her comments on that podcast. Every single one has my name in there.\"\n\nOnce considered a rising star in the Democratic party, Gabbard gave up a leadership position in the Democratic National Committee to back Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary.\n\nGabbard's foreign policy proposals have thrust her into the spotlight over the years, including being criticized for her seeming support for Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad. She traveled to Syria to meet with him and has openly questioned U.S. intelligence conclusions that Assad carried out chemical weapons attacks on his own people.", "description": "The Hawaii representative was already facing a primary challenge from State Senator Kai Kahele, and didn't raise any money for a re-election campaign in the third fundraising quarter", "authors": ["Caroline Linton"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/18/86030b23-9ba6-478b-bd41-ba752d8b7721/thumbnail/1200x630/37499b409ee19552e09faf78e107ca01/gettyimages-1165442315.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
