Coats\u2019s relationship with the president soured after the intelligence chief made public statements in defense of the intelligence community against White House attacks.\n\nNational security attorney Andrew Bakaj and President Trump.

Bakaj had reported reported his colleagues\u2019 concerns about evidence tampering within the CIA watchdog office to the Intelligence Community Inspector General. That office, after reviewing the concerns, immediately referred them to the FBI.\n\nThe CIA, however, put Bakaj on indefinite administrative leave and suspended his security clearance. As he was walked out of the office, security personnel put yellow police tape on his office door and combination locks.\n\nAfter months of waiting, Bakaj decided to leave government and enter private practice focusing on other national security whistleblowers.\n\nOn Aug. 8, more than five years after first blowing the whistle, the Department of Homeland Security inspector general vindicated Bakaj, confirming that his superiors launched a \u201cretaliatory investigation\u201d into his activities because of his actions and his protection of colleagues.\n\nBakaj\u2019s case reverberated after he left the CIA. In July 2018, acting CIA Inspector General Christopher Sharpley withdrew his nomination and resigned from the CIA following revelations that he had misled Congress about ongoing complaints of retaliation against him by Bakaj and his former colleague Jonathan Kaplan.\n\nBakaj is well placed to defend the Trump whistleblower, according to Irvin McCullough, a national security analyst for the Government Accountability Project, a transparency organization.\n\n\u201cAndrew\u2019s dedicated his career to bettering the lives of whistleblowers. He has a respect for the system he helped create and implement when he was on the inside,\u201d said McCullough.\n\nBakaj authored the regulations the CIA is required to follow to comply with President Barack Obama\u2019s Presidential Policy Directive 19, designed to protect intelligence community whistleblowers with access to classified information.\n\nBakaj has so far declined to discuss the case, keeping his client\u2019s identity secret.\n\nCongress, meanwhile, is trying to pry loose the details of this new complaint. Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, after hours of a closed door hearing before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, reportedly declined to share any further details.\n\nHowever, those familiar with the laws governing the inspector general say the administration won\u2019t be able to keep the complaint from Congress indefinitely.", "description": "Andrew Bakaj, an attorney who left the CIA in 2014 after facing professional retaliation for trying to work with intelligence community whistleblowers is now representing the U.S. official who reportedly filed a complaint alleging wrongdoing by President Trump.", "authors": ["Jenna Mclaughlin", "National Security", "Investigations Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/g8z_RM0w9ubWP4n_RXzH7Q--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/8ecc8790-db0c-11e9-9f7d-350093442d3a", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
