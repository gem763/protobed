Microplastics in them are macro offenders", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cThe tea bag\u2026 is in the process of a large-scale reinvention.\u201d\n\nSo reads a 2006 New York Times article on the rise of nylon mesh tea bags, an innovation that diversified the tea market and offered a new, fancier echelon of tea bag. \u201cInstead of paper,\u201d the writer explains, \u201cthe leaves will be enveloped by nylon mesh bags in a delicate pyramid shape,\u201d allowing for a larger brewing area and tastier drink, all without the \u201cchore of cleaning up the soggy remains\u201d.\n\nGood news, we thought. The innocent tea bag gets an upgrade, while remaining harmless. Not so much. These tea bags actually flood every cup with magnitudes of microplastics \u2013 according to a new study released by researchers at McGill University in Montreal last week.\n\nNathalie Tufenkji, a professor of chemical engineering, began studying nylon mesh tea bags after one was served to her at a local caf\u00e9.\n\nTufenkji and her team discovered that steeping a single silky plastic tea bag at brewing temperature (95 \u00b0C) releases approximately 11.6bn microplastics and 3.1bn nanoplastics (the latter are 150 times smaller than a hair, possibly small enough to permeate human cells) made up of nylon and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into a single cup of tea.\n\nWhen the researchers in the McGill study experimented with feeding the plastics to microscopic, shrimp-like creatures called water fleas, the fleas wigged the heck out.\n\nThe water fleas swam \u201ccrazily\u201d, Tufenkji told the CBC. Exposure to the plastics \u201creally stresses them out\u201d. The fleas\u2019 exoskeletons became unnaturally \u201cballooned,\u201d a worrisome effect which the researchers believe warrants further study.\n\nTo put it unscientifically, the amount of plastic found in these tea bags is more than we ingest from just about anything else. For context, a liter of water in a single-use plastic bottle contains 44 microplastic particles; a portion of mussels contains about 90; a kilogram of salt over 600. One study found we consume 70,000 particles annually just from the ambient dust that settles on our food.\n\nThis year, the World Wide Fund for Nature estimated that the average person ingests about five grams of plastic a week \u2013 the equivalent size of a credit card. Based on that research, over the course of a year we munch through over 260 grams of plastic, which, if you need a visual, looks like this bag of candy.\n\nYet studies like McGill\u2019s suggest such assessments are likely conservative and we are all consuming much more plastic than we realize. After all, currently only a sliver of common foods, like sugar, shellfish, and beer \u2013 representative of just of 15% of the calories consumed by the average person \u2013 have been analyzed for the presence of microplastics.\n\nThis all sounds pretty bad \u2013 are we destined to incrementally ingest plastic until we become a pile of bones and bottle caps, like those haunting images of dead sea birds? It would be good to know, but the effect of micro- and nanoplastics on human health is relatively unstudied and not currently considered major.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t find it particularly comforting that there\u2019s no hard research that plastics have negative health effects on humans,\u201d says Lindsay Miles, a Perth-based author and blogger who has espoused plastic-free living since 2012. Like DDT, asbestos, and cigarettes, \u201cEverything\u2019s safe until someone goes, \u2018Oh no! It\u2019s not safe anymore!\u2019\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been banging on about plastic in tea bags for years,\u201d adds Miles, who in 2014 wrote about a kind of plastic called polypropylene being used in many conventional paper tea bags \u2013 which she, like many, long incorrectly assumed were biodegradable.\n\n\u201c[When I contacted] some of the tea companies, they were saying, \u2018people don\u2019t really care\u2019 [about plastics in tea bags] and I\u2019m like, \u2018no, people do care, they just don\u2019t know,\u2019\u201d Miles says. Similarly, she believes the marketing of nylon tea bags as \u201csilken\u201d or \u201csilky\u201d may confuse consumers; a few upscale brands do package their teas in real, biodegradable silk or cotton, but many more use nylon.\n\n\u201cPeople may think they\u2019re made of silk, but they\u2019re not,\u201d says Miles.\n\nMichael Harney of Millerton, New York-based tea company Harney & Sons says his company has been using nylon tea sachets for over 20 years, but over the last six months has been investigating a fully biodegradable alternative.\n\n\u201c[We also] offer loose leaf tea, which is a good option,\u201d Harney notes.\n\nIndeed the wisest way to make a cup of tea free from either traces of polypropylene or a wallop of invisible plastic specks is to brew it old school \u2013 by steeping loose leaves in a reusable strainer. You\u2019ll have to clean out the \u201csoggy remains,\u201d yes, but some inconveniences are worthwhile.", "description": "New study finds nylon tea bags leech billions of microplastics into every single cup of tea", "authors": ["Adrienne Matei"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb0c86c654e6ac62c3cdd73a636f9cc6eab2a376/0_96_3004_1803/master/3004.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=89d7c5ca427c5d4f438ee05f6588cf4d", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
