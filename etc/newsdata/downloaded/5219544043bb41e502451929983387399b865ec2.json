Adam Murray has been appointed caretaker manager.\"\n\nBarnsley got their return to the second tier off to a perfect start with a 1-0 win over relegated Fulham.\n\nBut they have not won a game since, with their drubbing at the hands of Preston proving the final straw.\n\nStendel, 45, impressed in his first season in English football.\n\nHe was handed the job having previously managed Hannover 96, where he worked his way up after coaching their Under 19s.\n\n(Image: Keith Turner/REX)\n\nStendel hit the headlines last season after a clash with Fleetwood Town manager Joey Barton.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police launched an investigation into allegations Barton assaulted Stendel in the tunnel after Barnsley claimed a 4-2 win at Oakwell.\n\nBarton has since been charge with ABH and is due to appear in court this week after being bailed.\n\nStendel required emergency dental treatment following the incident.", "description": "Barnsley have opted to make a managerial change by sacking German Daniel Stendel after a tough start to life back in the Championship", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Nathan Stirk", "Keith Turner Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13815589.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Burnley-v-Barnsley-FA-Cup-Third-Round.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
