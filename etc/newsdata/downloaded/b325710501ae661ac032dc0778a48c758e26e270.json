Newly fired National Security Adviser John Bolton refused to go on TV to defend the president\u2019s idea, and was suspected of leaking the contents of the negotiations (the text of which he was only entrusted to read, not possess).\n\nUnder the proposed agreement with the Taliban, the U.S. would have immediately begun to reduce coalition troop numbers to 8,600 and withdrawn completely by the end of 2020, closed five U.S. military bases, released thousands of Taliban prisoners in Afghan government custody, and left the governance of Afghanistan to future negotiations among Afghans. The country\u2019s name would have reverted to the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, which it had been termed under Taliban rule. Afghans would have perceived this reversion as the U.S. surrendering their country into Taliban hands, and they would have been correct in that perception.\n\nIt\u2019s astonishing how little the Trump administration was willing to accept in exchange for an end to the conflict. The agreement didn\u2019t even require the Taliban to commit to a cease fire\u2014all it had to do was promise not to allow Afghan territory to be used as a base for terrorist operations against the U.S. It merits emphasizing the \u201cagainst the U.S.\u201d part of the equation, because what that would have blared to America\u2019s allies all over the world was that the U.S. is willing to separate its interests from those of Afghans and of countries that have been fighting alongside the U.S. in Afghanistan these 18 years. \u201cAmerica first\u201d really does mean sacrificing the interests of others.\n\nFrom the Taliban\u2019s perspective, this was a terrific deal\u2014America accepting defeat, striking a bargain with them that excluded the elected government of Afghanistan. The U.S. would have abandoned the prospects for a democratic Afghanistan, as well as progress in education and women\u2019s rights, and consigned the country to Taliban rule, since the reductions in military support would almost certainly have led to that outcome. The Taliban would have had to recognize the Ghani government, but it could have afforded to do that since it would soon, no doubt, have overthrown it.\n\nThe president has now declared the negotiations dead. But he seems no less committed to withdrawing U.S. troops, since he subsequently tweeted that the U.S. military should not be \u201cserving as policemen in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s characterization represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the U.S. mission. Five years ago, the U.S. and its coalition partners shifted from conducting operations themselves to training, advising, and assisting Afghan forces. Afghans have been doing the most dangerous work of clearing their country of malign Taliban influence. Afghan National Security Forces have paid a devastatingly high price for it, too: more than 45,000 Afghan service men and women have been killed just since 2014. That\u2019s about 20 killed per day. And yet they continue to volunteer.", "description": "The president should have to answer for the Afghanistan mess in the 2020 election.", "authors": ["Kori Schake", "Contributing Editor At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX2V9HU/facebook.jpg?1568150153", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
