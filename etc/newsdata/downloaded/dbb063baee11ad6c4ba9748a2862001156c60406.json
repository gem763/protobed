The call between the leaders, at 8 a.m. Tuesday, came after a text message from one of the prime minister\u2019s officials, reported by the Spectator magazine, said his government is preparing for talks to collapse.\n\nMinisters have published updated no-deal Brexit planning documents as negotiations between the U.K. and EU continue in Brussels.\n\nKey Developments\n\nU.K. tweaks no-deal tariff schedule for trucks, fuel and clothing\n\nShapps says U.K. would not punish EU states who back a Brexit delay\n\nFormer minister Amber Rudd says she would back a second referendum\n\nJohnson Warned Against Big Tax Cuts as U.K. Faces No-Deal Shock\n\nPound slips 0.5% against the dollar\n\nTusk Says Brexit Not \u2018Stupid Blame Game\u2019 (11:40 a.m.)\n\nEU Council President Donald Tusk held no punches in the ever escalating war of words between Brussels and London, accusing Boris Johnson of playing a \u2018stupid blame game\u2019 in his dealings with the bloc.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game. At stake is the future of Europe and the U.K. as well as the security and interests of our people,\u201d Tusk wrote on Twitter. \u201cYou don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke,\u201d the Council President added, before asking \"quo vadis?\u201d the Latin for \"where are you going?\u201d\n\nDUP\u2019s Foster Assails \u2018Crazy\u2019 Merkel Demand (11.30 a.m.)\n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster assailed German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s reported comments that Northern Ireland must remain in the EU customs union (see 10:35 a.m.), describing the idea as a \u201csurrender.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the U.K. to be asked to leave a part of its sovereign territory in a foreign organisation of which the U.K. would no longer be a part and over which we would have no say whatsoever is beyond crazy,\u201d Foster said in a statement.\n\nJohnson Can\u2019t Be Trusted, Scottish Court Told (11:15 a.m.)\n\nBrexit is back in Scotland\u2019s highest court as a group of petitioners argue it should write the letter to the EU requesting more time, as required by an Act of Parliament last month. The letter would then be sent in the event of Boris Johnson failing to comply with the law.\n\nAidan O\u2019Neill, the lawyer representing the group, told the panel of three judges at the Court of Session in Edinburgh that Johnson just can\u2019t be trusted, a line that\u2019s underpinned a series of legal challenges.\n\n\u201cWhat happens if he leads some sort of conscientious objection?\u201d O\u2019Neill asked. \u201cWe have a prime minister who apparently thinks he can continue his practice as a journalist by making things up and telling lies.\u201d\n\nThe judges asked why the case on appointing someone to write the extension letter had come to them. The arguments will continue through the day.\n\nStarmer Says Johnson Wants No-Deal Split (10:45 a.m.)\n\nKeir Starmer, Brexit spokesman for the opposition Labour Party, accused Johnson of following a \u201ccynical\u201d strategy to intentionally \u201csabotage\u201d the talks with the EU.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson will never take responsibility for his own failure to put forward a credible deal. His strategy from day one has been for a no-deal Brexit,\u201d Starmer said in a statement. \u201cIt is now more important than ever that Parliament unites to prevent this reckless Government crashing us out of the EU at the end of the month.\u201d\n\nJohnson to Merkel: Deal Essentially Impossible (10:35 a.m.)\n\nBoris Johnson held what seems to have been a very difficult phone call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday morning.\n\nAccording to a British official, Merkel told the premier Northern Ireland must remain part of the EU\u2019s customs union if he wants to secure a divorce agreement with the bloc. Johnson told the German chancellor that this demand, along with the EU\u2019s unwillingness to engage with his new proposals, makes a deal essentially impossible.\n\n#r4today https://t.co/vGzsEmOXhf pic.twitter.com/7B5vNTDfIH\n\n\u2014 BBC Radio 4 Today (@BBCr4today) October 8, 2019\n\n\n\nWith little progress made in recent days, U.K. officials now believe Brexit talks are close to collapse. The BBC, which first reported details of the conversation, said Johnson\u2019s office regarded the call as a clarifying moment.\n\nBrexit Deal Looks \u2018Difficult,\u2019 DUP Says (10 a.m.)\n\nDUP Deputy Leader Nigel Dodds said it looks unlikely a deal to break the impasse over Brexit will be reached this week, as the U.K. and EU remain divided over a plan which would effectively offer his party a veto over measures to avoid a hard border in Ireland.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg TV, he said he doesn\u2019t see Boris Johnson watering down the consent principle and accused Dublin of wanting to have \u201cits cake and eat it\u201d on the issue.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar appears to be \u201cdesperate\u201d to avoid the blame for a no-deal Brexit, Dodds said.\n\nShapps Denies U.K. Planning to Punish EU States (Earlier)\n\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps denied the U.K. Government is drawing up plans to punish EU member states that agree to a delay to the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline. The threat was in a text message from one of Boris Johnson\u2019s advisers published by the Spectator magazine.\n\nThe note, attributed to a \u201ccontact in Number 10\u201d, said that any EU member state that agrees to delay Brexit would go to the back of the line for cooperation on defense and security.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case at all,\u201d Shapps told BBC Radio. He said it isn\u2019t clear who wrote the text and insisted the government is in serious talks with the EU to get a deal.\n\nRudd Accepts Case For Second Referendum (Earlier)\n\nAmber Rudd, who quit Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet last month in protest at his Brexit policy, said she now accepts the case for a confirmatory vote on any deal agreed with the EU.\n\n\u201cWe need to look much more carefully about how to find a compromise,\u201d she told BBC Radio, accusing Johnson of giving up on reaching agreement with the bloc.\n\n\u201cI still believe that we could find a deal that gets through the House of Commons,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we need to make sure that the Number 10 machine works with MPs, stops expelling MPs -- perhaps from its own party, works cross-party with Labour, and yes, may indeed have to have a confirmatory referendum on a deal at some stage to get it through.\u201d\n\nU.K. Tweaks No-Deal Brexit Tariffs (Earlier)\n\nThe U.K. revamped the tariffs it will levy after a no-deal Brexit following warnings from industry that its earlier plans risked making domestic producers uncompetitive.\n\nImport duties for heavy goods vehicles will be reduced to 10%, in a boost to the road haulage industry, while levies for bio-ethanol will be raised and new tariffs for clothing introduced, the Department for International Trade said on Tuesday.\n\nEarlier:\n\nBoris Johnson Preparing for Brexit Talks to Collapse: SpectatorU.K. Tweaks No-Deal Brexit Tariffs for Trucks, Fuel and ClothingJohnson Warned Against Big Tax Cuts as U.K. Faces No-Deal Shock", "description": "Johnson Tells Merkel Deal \u2018Essentially Impossible\u2019: Brexit Update", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picf2b243d1d77b5fb2282eca4daeed95cf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
