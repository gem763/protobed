But a Spanish law on cultural treasures might create difficulties for a foreign buyer seeking to bring the treasure home.\n\nThe painting dating from 1500 is billed as the last by the Florentine Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli in private hands outside of Italy and on the international art market, generating excitement around the annual Frieze art fair, which opens Thursday.\n\nThe sale is being arranged by Trinity Art Gallery in London. Gallery owner and Italian art dealer Carlo Orsi said the painting\u2019s strength is in its expression and the significance of the person it portrays: Michele Marrulo, a well-known Latin poet of the Medici court and adventurer of the Renaissance.\n\n\u201cPortraits mirror the human person, and Botticelli in this case represents this humanist poet and warrior with an incredible force of expression that is moving,\u201d Orsi said.\n\nCarl Brandon Strehlke, curator emeritus of the Philadelphia Museum of Art who compiled the catalog for the sale, said the subject\u2019s pose is defiant, \u201cbust-length with wild eyes, hair out of place. It seems as if he is about to say something or talk.\u201d\n\nBotticelli has \u201creally been able to capture him as if he were living, even though the painting might be posthumous as it could very well be painted after Michele Marrulo\u2019s death by drowning in 1500,\u201d Strehlke said.\n\nThe painting is owned by the descendants of politician Francesc Cambo, who acquired it in 1929. The family has previously donated other works of art to Spanish museums but decided to sell this one.\n\nThe portrait was on loan for more than a decade from 2004 to Madrid\u2019s El Prado Museum. Spain declared it \u201ca work of cultural interest\u201d in 1988, which means it cannot lose its link to Spain. Such works \u201ccan only cross our frontiers with official authorization and for a limited period of time established by the permit,\u201d the culture ministry said.\n\nThe painting is currently in London on a permit. If it is sold, it must be returned to Spain by Oct. 25. The Spanish cultural ministry has the right of first refusal to match the price. If the ministry decides not to purchase it, a buyer residing outside Spain would have to ask for a permit of temporary exportation, which the ministry said \u201ccould be granted or not.\u201d\n\nOrsi said he\u2019s not concerned about Spain\u2019s right of refusal, which is a process similar to that for significant cultural works in his native Italy.\n\n\u201cWe will see if the government wants to let it go or not,\u201d Orsi said, adding that Spain had not expressed an interest in purchasing it during the painting\u2019s years at the Prado.\n\nOrsi said ideally the painting would be purchased by a museum, even though that limits the pool of buyers. But even if it lands in private hands, he said it was unlikely to be out of public view for long.\n\n\u201cIt has traveled to shows in the past, and it has been requested for a show in Paris next year. It is so important, that even if it is bought by a private collector, it won\u2019t disappear and not be seen any more,\u201d Orsi said.\n\n____\n\nWilson reported from Barcelona.
