Government has proposed splitting the power utility into three entities \u2013 generation, transmission and distribution \u2013 with the three entities remaining under a state holding company.\n\nSacks and Mazars' national head of tax services Mike Teuchert have both questioned whether keeping all three entities under the ownership of Eskom will make a difference in solving Eskom's financial problems.\n\nUnlike other state-owned enterprises, Eskom is essential in ensuring the sustainability of the economy, which would impact on the country's credit rating, Sacks explained.\n\nMoody's blues\n\n\"We may be staring down a barrel of a downgrade. We hope that won\u2019t happen, but that is a very real risk,\" he warned. Moody's is the only ratings agency which still has SA ranked at investment grade, and its next review is due in November.\n\nOne of the biggest causes of concern is the recent announcement of stage 2 load shedding, Sacks said.\n\nEskom on Wednesday issued a statement indicating that five electricity generating units are down. Furthermore, a conveyor belt carrying coal to Medupi power station broke down on Saturday on October 12, contributing to the problem, Fin24 previously reported. Eskom has been relying on open cycle gas turbines to meet energy demand. But diesel levels and dam levels \u2013 which are needed to run the open cycle has turbines \u2013 are running low.\n\nEskom is yet to respond to Fin24 to provide more clarity on the technical issues.\n\n\n\nEskom's inability to deliver electricity demand, especially in spring, when demand is expected to be lower than the winter months, is cause for concern, according to Sacks.\n\n\"The capacity of Eskom to deliver is on [a] knife edge,\" he said.\n\nLoad shedding is one more contributing factor to Eskom's drain on the fiscus, he added. Currently, Eskom cannot service interest on debt, indicating the company is not viable.\n\nIn an economy facing sluggish growth, load shedding will add more challenges, he noted. It has been estimated that load shedding this year cost the economy R1bn per stage, per day, Sacks said.\n\n'Window dressing'\n\nBloomberg previously reported that Eskom has asked government to take on its debt. Sacks commented that although this would help solve Eskom's financial performance problems, it would make government's financial position look \"even more shabby\".\n\n\"What that means is, we are plugging the gaps. It's a bit of window dressing,\" he said. Instead the focus should be on fixing Eskom's ability to deliver as well as its financial performance, he opined. However, he added, solutions might not be welcomed by all stakeholders - especially unions, who might push back if proposals could impact jobs.\n\n\n\n\"But if we fail to take action now, my fear is that we would find that load shedding becomes a way of life. I don't think any of us want that,\" Sacks said.\n\nHe even suggested that government would not be able to deliver on other goals, such as National Health Insurance, if income remained constrained. \"Sufficient income is going to require growth and growth is going to require electricity. We are in a vicious circle. We have to break the circle and start growing the economy,\" he said.\n\n\n\nRestructuring\n\nCommenting on the restructuring of Eskom into three entities, Sacks said it would be a \"long and expensive\" process. \"In doing so, it may detract from the job at hand to generate sufficient electricity and paying the bills,\" he said.\n\nTeuchert said that up until 2009, Eskom was functioning successfully as a single entity. He said once corruption and state capture came into play, the power utility started floundering.\n\nHe suggested selling off one of the entities or privatising it to help Eskom settle some of its debt. But simply splitting the entity and not changing the ownership structure will not result in Eskom's debt going away, he said.", "description": "Eskom's inability to deliver electricity supply during Spring is cause for concern, according to a tax expert.", "authors": ["Lameez Omarjee"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8522/3cc1e6c7deb9460cae8063614a959b0b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
