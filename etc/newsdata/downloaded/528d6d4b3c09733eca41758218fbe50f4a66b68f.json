That doesn\u2019t include the new Pixel Buds or the Pixelbook Go however, which aren't available for pre-order. (The Pixelbook is unlikely to launch in Australia.)\n\nPixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL\n\nDespite being leaked over the past few months, the Pixel 4 and 4 XL were still the biggest announcements during today\u2019s livestream. The new pair of flagship smartphones are getting in on the high-refresh-rate craze with 90Hz OLED screens (5.7-inches on the Pixel 4, and 6.3 inches for the Pixel 4 XL). We also got a look at the new camera and its real-time HDR processing features; its new AI-powered audio recording app; and details on the powerful new specs that enable hands-free gesture controls.\n\nRelease date: October 24, 2019\n\nPrices:\n\nPixel 4 - $1,049 (64GBs); $1,199 (128GBs)\n\nPixel 4 XL - $1,279 (64Gbs); $1,429 (128GBs)\n\nColour options: The Pixel 4 and 4 XL come in Clearly White, Just Black and Oh So Orange, though specific availability varies between models.\n\nPreorder: Google Store\n\nNest Mini (second generation)\n\nGoogle also showed an updated version of its tiny Nest Mini smart speaker.

Google claims the Nest wifi will be able to support up to 200 device connections and multiple simultaneous 4K video streams. And you can increase its range (and number of supported devices) with a separate Nest wifi point \u2014 giving you a mesh network that can cover even more space than before.\n\nReleases: November 5, 2019\n\nPrices:\n\nNest Wifi router: $269\n\nNest Wifi point: $229 (requires Nest Wifi or previous Google Wifi router)\n\nColours: The Nest Wifi router is available in off-white, while the Nest Wifi point comes in off-white, coral pink and sky blue.\n\nPreorder: Google Store", "description": "We all knew Google would announce its Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL during today\u2019s Made by Google 2019 event, but the company showed off a handful of other devices, too: a new Pixelbook Go laptop, an update to the Pixel Buds wireless earphones, and a new Nest smarthome speaker (and mesh Wi-Fi system)....", "authors": ["Alan Henry", "Kevin Purdy"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/l/2019/10/Pixel-4-front-and-bacj.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
