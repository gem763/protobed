Among them is Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, another key figure in the probe.\n\nThe administration has struggled to come up with a unified response to the quickly progressing investigation. Democrats have warned that defying their demands will in itself be considered \u201cevidence of obstruction\u201d and a potentially impeachable offense.\n\nPompeo has become a key figure in the Democrats\u2019 investigation. He was on the line during the July phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter \u2014 sparking a whistleblower complaint and now the impeachment inquiry.\n\nPompeo had initially tried to delay a handful of current and former officials from cooperating with the inquiry and accused Democrats trying to \u201cbully\u201d his staffers.\n\nOn Saturday, Pompeo did not back off his defense of Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThere has been some suggestion somehow that it would be inappropriate for the United States government to engage in that activity and I see it just precisely the opposite,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has offered a series of contradictory statements when it comes to the Democrats\u2019 subpoena of White House records.\n\nAsked Wednesday whether the White House intended to comply, Trump told reporters, \u201cI always cooperate,\u201d even as he dismissed the inquiry as \u201ca hoax.\u201d A day later, however, Trump had a different answer for the same question, saying he would instead leave the matter to his lawyers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s up to them to decide,\u201d he said, \u201cBut the whole investigation is crumbling.\u201d\n\nBy Friday, however, Trump confirmed reports the White House was preparing a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., arguing that Congress cannot undertake an impeachment investigation without first having a vote to authorize it. Pelosi has insisted the House is well within its rules to conduct oversight of the executive branch under the Constitution regardless.\n\nIt was unclear Saturday when or if that letter would be sent.\n\nPompeo, meanwhile, made clear that the State Department had yet to turn over any document, but intended to follow a proper review. And he said he would do so faster than the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cI remember precisely once when I was on that side and we were looking for documents, I remember precisely how long it took for those documents to come across,\u201d he said in an apparent reference to his experience as a congressman during the investigation into the 2012 attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to beat that. We\u2019re going to be more responsive than the Obama administration was in the years that preceded this particular Congress,\u201d he said.\n\nA congressional aide familiar with Pompeo\u2019s response confirmed that the State Department had indeed been in contact, even if Pompeo had failed to meet a Friday deadline to produce documents required by the subpoena.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, continued to seethe Saturday, denouncing the investigation as yet another \u201cWitch Hunt!\u201d and \u201ca fraud against the American people!\u201d\n\nIn a series of tweets Saturday, including several sent as his presidential motorcade ferried him back and forth to his Virginia golf course, Trump defended his conduct and lashed out at critics, including a past foil, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing that the Great People of Utah are considering their vote for their Pompous Senator, Mitt Romney, to be a big mistake. I agree! He is a fool who is playing right into the hands of the Do Nothing Democrats!\u201d Trump wrote. He ended his tweet with an extraordinary call to impeach a senator from his own party.\n\nYet Romney was joined Saturday in his criticism by a second Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, who said \u201cit\u2019s not OK\u201d for a president to encourage a foreign state to investigate a political rival.\n\nSpeaking after a firefighter memorial service in Maine, Collins said Trump made a \u201cbig mistake\u201d when he piled on his outreach to Ukraine by publicly calling on China to investigate the Bidens.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska is the only other Republican senator to publicly criticize the president\u2019s comments that further fueled an impeachment inquiry.\n\nLawmakers are focused on Trump\u2019s efforts to push Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. A whistleblower complaint said that Trump sought to use military assistance for Ukraine as leverage to push the newly elected Zelenskiy to launch an inquiry into the 2020 Democratic hopeful.\n\nLate Thursday, House investigators released a cache of text messages that showed top U.S. diplomats encouraging Zelenskiy to conduct an investigation linked to Biden\u2019s family in return for granting a high-profile visit with Trump in Washington.\n\nThe release followed a 10-hour interview with one of the diplomats, Kurt Volker, who stepped down as special envoy to Ukraine after the impeachment inquiry had begun.\n\n___\n\nLee reported from Athens, Greece.
