A casualty of the Harvey Weinstein scandal that has languished on the shelf for two years, this historical saga about the birth of electricity -- and the battle between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse -- isn't nearly as illuminating as it should be, despite a cast that includes Benedict Cumberbatch and Michael Shannon.\n\nThe film's release is being billed as its \"Director's Cut,\" but cutting -- and editing -- is a big part of the problem. As constructed by director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon (from a script by Michael Mitnick), the scenes are so short and choppy -- it's as if there's a 30-second limit on them -- as to undermine the performances, making the high-wattage actors looking little more than the players in dramatic reenactments on some National Geographic special.\n\nIt's a shame, since the subject matter has so much going for it, kicking off in 1880 -- when Edison (Cumberbatch) registered his first incandescent-bulb patent -- and extending through the Chicago World's Fair in 1893.\n\nIn between, Edison and Westinghouse waged a brutal battle for supremacy, with the former -- angered by his belief that the industrialist was essentially pirating his creation -- using his celebrity inventor status to smear the latter's tech as dangerous and harmful.\n\nUnconcerned about money, Edison still needed a lot of it, securing backing from financier J.P.
