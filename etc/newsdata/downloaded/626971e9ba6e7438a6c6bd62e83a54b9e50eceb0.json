Expert insight. Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\n2020 Democrats try to strike a balance on impeachment\n\nThe launch of an impeachment inquiry against President Trump has scrambled Democratic presidential campaigns, as candidates work to balance their responses to the scandal with more messaging about the policies that set them apart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, they are trying to respond to rising concerns that Democratic voters have about President Trump\u2019s conduct,\u201d national politics reporter Sean Sullivan says. \u201cAt the same time, they\u2019re still trying to talk about the issues, health care, climate change, income inequality \u2014 the kitchen table issues.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a case for reparations, but how would they work?\n\nThe Democratic presidential primary contest has amplified efforts by black academics and activists to steer the national conversation around reparations \u2014 the most mainstream discussion of reparations since post-Civil War Reconstruction.\n\nA majority of Americans oppose paying monetary reparations to the descendants of slaves, polls show. But support for such a measure has doubled since the early 2000s, leaving those who agree to answer a critical question: Who would be eligible to receive payouts?\n\n\n\n\n\nNational reporter Wesley Lowery connected with an academic at the forefront of the conversation who has advocated for reparations to people who prove they descended from a person enslaved in the United States and that they have identified as black in public documents for at least 10 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe idea here was that black Americans and specifically Americans who were the descendants of slaves have faced structural impediments that have not allowed them to accumulate wealth,\u201d Lowery says. \u201cAnd, therefore, the United States government has to make them whole in some kind of way.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the Chinese zodiac year of the pig, a pork shortage\n\nRed fried pork. Glazed pork belly. Pork dumplings. In these and other forms, China consumes half the world\u2019s pork, its people eating an average of 120 pounds of pork yearly.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut with a slew of holidays coming up, and the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, officials are worried that a staggering pork shortage could destabilize the country\u2019s politics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe government is extremely worried that Chinese people will be unhappy when they return to their hometowns and get ready for family feasts, and discover that the price of pork has risen so much that it\u2019s unaffordable,\u201d Beijing bureau chief Anna Fifield says. \u201cThis may have political ramifications for them that are not just about being able to have a feast on the national day.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Sean Sullivan tracks how Democratic presidential candidates are responding to the impeachment inquiry.
