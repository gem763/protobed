We got to have a different conversation.\"\n\nLongtime host Joy Behar brought up the federal assault weapons ban in 1994 under former President Bill Clinton. \"If you keeping rooting for Republicans, you're going to get nothing done.\"\n\n\"The AR-15 is by far the most popular gun in America, by far,\" McCain said. \"I was just in the middle of nowhere Wyoming, if you're talking about taking people's guns from them, there's going to be a lot of violence.\"\n\n\"But they lived without them for many years during the ban,\" Behar replied.\n\n\"I'm not living without guns,\" McCain responded. \"It's just that simple!\"\n\nAbby Huntsman, a friend of McCain's, wondered if they could live in an America where you could \"walk in a mall and not look around, and not be nervous that someone is going to pull out a shotgun.\"\n\n\"None of you feel safe? I feel safe that I can protect myself,\" McCain said. \"Alright, welcome back.\"\n\nOver the weekend, a 36-year-old gunman killed seven people and wounded 22 others in Texas hours after being reportedly fired from his trucking job. He purchased his AR-style rifle from a private seller, federal law enforcement sources confirmed to CBS News, allowing him to evade a federal background check. Sources also say the gunman was previously denied a gun purchase because he was determined to be mentally unfit.", "description": "\"The View\" co-host warned there could be \"violence\" if people's guns are taken away from them", "authors": ["Christopher Brito"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/04/8c919737-a78c-49e4-9e44-d3df2daeeaf0/thumbnail/1200x630/327c80af929fb21eb51967a1a71da257/meghan-mccain-the-view-abc.png"}
