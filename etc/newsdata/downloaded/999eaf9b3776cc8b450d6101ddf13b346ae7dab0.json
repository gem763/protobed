After years of trying to figure out what was \u201cwrong\u201d with her, she was diagnosed with autism at age 13. She realized as she got older that training kept her calm, and it\u2019s paid off. Now, at age 27, she\u2019s set for her Invicta FC debut on Friday and hopes not just to win in the cage, but make a difference outside of it.\n\n****\n\nLAS VEGAS \u2013 Most fighters dream of competing under the bright lights of a major promotion and hearing the roar of the crowd descend upon the cage. Serena DeJesus doesn\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s not that DeJesus isn\u2019t interested in competing at MMA\u2019s highest levels. Quite the opposite, in fact. It\u2019s just that DeJesus\u2019 autism means that she is incredibly sensitive to things like heat, light and noise, making the cage on fight night a major challenge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like overwhelming your computer with 5,000 different commands,\u201d DeJesus told MMA Junkie. \u201cYour computer is like, \u2018(Expletive), what do I do?'\u201d\n\nDeJesus, 27, was born and raised in Philadelphia. Early in her childhood, her mother knew something was amiss, with Serena non-verbal until she was almost 6 and painfully shy, often distracted and disappearing into her own world. Unfortunately, understanding of the autism spectrum disorder back then was quite distant from where it stands today, and DeJesus was subjected to one psychotropic drug after another following a seemingly never-ending series of misdiagnoses such as attention-deficit disorder and ADHD.\n\nDeJesus remembers it as a very frustrating time.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get some of the social issues,\u201d DeJesus said. \u201cLike, why does it have to be this way? Why is the way I want not acceptable? Why do I have to go play outside? Why can\u2019t I just chill with myself and enjoy playing with my Legos? Why can\u2019t I just chill and enjoy a book, you know? Why is it I have to be playing with a whole bunch of kids all the time in order to be perceived as \u2018normal\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t even need any damn fixing to begin with\u2019\n\nThe drugs only served to exacerbate her symptoms, making her more prone to distraction and \u2013 when provoked \u2013 more violent. That came to a head at age 13, when DeJesus was confronted by a bully and admittedly snapped, throwing the girl off the top of a 16-foot jungle gym.\n\nDeJesus was kicked out of school, and her mother and stepfather were again left searching for answers.\n\nFortunately, a brief stay at Philadelphia\u2019s SeaShore House, a top children\u2019s hospital, led doctors to take her off all medications in hopes of a more accurate assessment.\n\nThat\u2019s when she was diagnosed with autism.\n\n\u201cWhen I was diagnosed with autism, it was like, \u2018Oh, I didn\u2019t even need any damn fixing to begin with. That was a total waste of my time, energy, emotions, and it hurt me a lot,'\u201d DeJesus recalled.\n\nWith the help of a caseworker, DeJesus spent the next seven years learning coping skills and integrating herself better into the world around her. Then, while attending Montgomery County Community College, she found an opportunity to train Brazilian jiu-jitsu and muay Thai, and she jumped at the chance.\n\nMMA and the struggle to make it work\n\n\u201cI watched UFC with my dad on VHS because my reward for doing well in school was to take me to the video store,\u201d DeJesus said. \u201cI got a whole bunch of anime, and my dad got UFC, but I also loved fighting video games, like \u2018Street Fighter\u2019 and Tekken. I still have the original \u2018Tekken\u2019 on PS1. That\u2019s how much I love it. So I came downstairs one day, and I\u2019m seeing Gary Goodridge in that infamous crucifix, bashing Paul Herrera to death. I thought, \u2018Holy crap!\u2019 The whole transition looked like something out of Tekken, like when you execute a grab combo on somebody, so I\u2019m like, \u2018This is so cool.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen I was a kid, my parents also had me in taekwondo. And training in general, they found, kind of mellows me out. So everything just fit in place. I had no athletic activities in high school, so I jumped right into muay Thai and jiu-jitsu and all that, and it worked. My stimming \u2013 I didn\u2019t shake as much, I didn\u2019t feel as overwhelmed. I didn\u2019t have too many outbursts from sensory stuff, so it just worked for me.\u201d\n\nDeJesus was hooked, and she eventually left school to pursue her dream of building a career around her new passions. She made her amateur MMA debut in 2013, eventually building a 5-2 record, even as the lights and noise of fight night wreaked havoc with her sensory overload. Still, she found that once the fight started, she was completely in her element.\n\n\u201cThere are extra little things that I have to do,\u201d DeJesus said of her fight night experience. \u201cI have a lot more CBD oil in my system than normal just to help me with the sensory issues. I keep my hat on. I keep my headphones on pretty much until I walk out. I keep my glasses on until it\u2019s time to actually step in the cage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very big on routines, so I just try to stay as close to my routine as possible, and I just go out and try to do my thing, just execute everything I\u2019ve learned in training, and try and keep my nerves down \u2013 the same nerves that everybody gets \u2013 and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nLeaving everything behind for a dream realized\n\nAs DeJesus continued her training, she became a fan of Roxanne Modafferi \u2013 identifying with, in her own words, an athlete who \u201cwas someone like me, a fighter, but also a nerd who was into Japanese anime.\u201d DeJesus reached out to Modafferi via Facebook, asking if she could come out to Las Vegas to train alongside \u201cThe Happy Warrior,\u201d who was, at the time, competing under the Invicta banner.\n\nThe two quickly formed a bond.\n\n\u201cBetween our love of anime and nerdy things and fighting, we just became best friends,\u201d DeJesus said.\n\nDeJesus eventually moved to Las Vegas to train full time alongside Modafferi at Syndicate MMA.\n\n\u201cWith my mom\u2019s blessing, I left everything behind in Philadelphia,\u201d DeJesus said. \u201cI had two giant duffle bags to my name at first, and I made it work.\u201d\n\nThe investment paid off.\n\nOn Friday, DeJesus (1-0) takes on fellow women\u2019s bantamweight Taneisha Tennant (1-0) at Invicta FC 38, which streams live on UFC Fight Pass from Memorial Hall in Kansas City, Kan.\n\nBigger than fighting\n\nIt\u2019s a huge moment for DeJesus\u2019 professional career, fighting for one of the sport\u2019s premier organizations. But \u201cThe Southpaw Outlaw\u201d readily admits she doesn\u2019t just view fighting as a selfish endeavor.\n\n\u201cI just really want to be that good, influential figure that\u2019s like, \u2018Hey, she\u2019s autistic, and she\u2019s doing things,'\u201d DeJesus said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping for other people to be like, \u2018Just because I have this going on with me doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m limited to one side of life.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe live in a society now where we know what autism is. It\u2019s different than when I first got diagnosed. Back then, nobody knew what it was. But I want to show that autism is not portrayed by the stereotypes \u2013 that you\u2019re either a savant, like you see on television, or you\u2019re a kid or adult banging your head against the wall. That\u2019s the kind of stuff I\u2019m trying to show people \u2013 everyday people like our neurotypical peers, meaning people without autism, but I also want to show other people who may be discouraged because of said stereotypes and other things that they can do what they want, too.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s story on the spectrum is different. I\u2019m not saying that every autist is going to be a fighter or every autist is going to do this, but I would hope that me being here means it would not be so terrible for all.\u201d\n\nThe bright lights will be on. The cameras will be rolling. The roar of the crowd will certainly be heard, especially if DeJesus is able to put on the \u201cbanger of a fight\u201d she\u2019s expecting.\n\nFor DeJesus, every one of those elements presents a special challenge, but it\u2019s one she takes on with a purpose in mind. She hopes that, through fighting, she can continue to advocate for others on the spectrum. But she also wants to prove that she simply belongs.\n\n\u201cI just want to show that I\u2019ve earned my spot here,\u201d DeJesus said. \u201cI\u2019ve trained. I\u2019ve worked a lot, and I just want to prove that I belong there and make a general statement that I\u2019m finally here.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have been looking forward to me being in Invicta, so I need to not let them down.\u201d", "description": "Unlike most in MMA fighters, Serena DeJesus doesn't dream of competing under the bright lights or hearing the roar of the crowd.", "authors": ["John Morgan", "Farah Hannoun", "The Blue Corner", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Dan Tom"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/serena-dejesus-john-wood.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
