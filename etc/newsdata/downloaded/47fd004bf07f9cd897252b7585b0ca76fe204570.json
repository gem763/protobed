(AP) \u2014 Lamical Perine ran 88 yards for a touchdown in the fourth quarter, Florida's defense delivered another gem and the No. 10 Gators beat seventh-ranked Auburn 24-13 in the Swamp on Saturday.\n\nPerine broke linebacker K.J. Britt's tackle at the line of scrimmage and scampered down the sideline for the program's longest TD run in more than 30 years. It gave the Gators (6-0, 3-0 Southeastern Conference) extra breathing room in a game they never trailed.\n\nThe biggest reason they led throughout: defense.\n\nJon Greenard and David Reese were the stars of the show for Florida, which has given up a measly 16 points in four home games this season.\n\nThe Gators kept JaTarvious Whitlow in check and harassed freshman quarterback Bo Nix, whose father, Patrick, upset top-ranked Florida in Gainesville in 1994.\n\nNix completed 11 of 27 passes for 145 yards for Auburn (5-1, 2-1), with a touchdown and three interceptions. He was sacked three times, once for a 22-yard loss in which he looked completely lost.\n\nFlorida's Kyle Trask was equally turnover-prone, although much more efficient through the air. He was seemingly knocked out of the game in the second quarter when Auburn star Derrick Brown landed on his left leg. Trask eventually walked to the locker room with no assistance and returned to a raucous ovation.\n\nHe completed 19 of 31 passes for 234 yards and two touchdowns. He also fumbled three times.\n\nFlorida coach Dan Mullen told CBS at halftime that Trask sprained a knee ligament.\n\nNO. 19 MICHIGAN 10, NO. 14 IOWA 3\n\nANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Zach Charbonnet had a 2-yard touchdown run to give Michigan an early double-digit lead and its defense did the rest against Iowa, forcing four turnovers and making eight sacks.\n\nThe Wolverines (4-1, 2-1 Big Ten) were held scoreless over the final three quarters because they could not run or pass effectively, scoring just three points off the Hawkeyes' turnovers.\n\nIowa (4-1, 1-1) failed to take advantage of favorable field position on its final two drives with a chance to extend the game or possibly win it with a touchdown and 2-point conversion. The Hawkeyes turned the ball over on downs at the Michigan 44 with 37 seconds left after a penalty- and sack-filled drive forced them to punt with a fourth-and-36 at midfield on the previous possession.\n\nIowa running back Mekhi Sargent fumbled on his team's first snap, giving up the ball at the Hawkeyes 18. Michigan, though, had to settle for a field goal after gaining just 6 yards. The Wolverines took a 10-0 lead on their next drive, which started with a 51-yard pass to Nico Collins and finished with Charbonnet's 2-yard run.\n\nIowa avoided a shutout with Keith Duncan's 22-yard field goal early in the second quarter.\n\nMichigan's Shea Patterson was 14 of 26 for 147 yards with an interception.\n\nIowa's Nate Stanley was 23 of 42 for 260 yards with three interceptions, ending a 139-pass streak without getting picked off.\n\nNO. 3 GEORGIA 43, TENNESSEE 14\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Jake Fromm threw two touchdown passes, Georgia's defense delivered a dominant second-half performance and the Bulldogs recovered from a slow start to beat Tennessee.\n\nGeorgia (5-0, 2-0 Southeastern Conference) scored the final 33 points to earn its 15th straight victory over Eastern Division opponent. Georgia capped the onslaught when Tae Crowder scored on a 60-yard fumble return with 4:39 left after Eric Stokes sacked Brian Maurer to knock the ball loose.\n\nThe Bulldogs haven't lost to an SEC East team since falling 24-10 to Florida on Oct. 29, 2016.\n\nFromm went 24 of 29 for 288 yards. Brian Herrien and D'Andre Swift combined to run for 160 yards and each had a 1-yard touchdown run.\n\nTennessee (1-4, 0-2) has lost its last six matchups with Football Bowl Subdivision teams and is off to its slowest start since 1988, when it dropped its first six games. Tennessee's lone win this season was a 45-0 blowout of Football Championship Subdivision program Chattanooga.\n\nNO. 4 OHIO STATE 34, NO. 25 MICHIGAN STATE 10\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Justin Fields threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score, J.K. Dobbins rushed for 172 yards and a touchdown and Ohio State overcame a sluggish start.\n\nThe Buckeyes (6-0, 3-0 Big Ten) had to work to figure out Michigan State's defense to start, after blowing out every opponent through the first five games. They gained just 16 yards on 16 plays in the first quarter, but got unstuck and put away the Spartans (4-2, 2-1) with big plays.\n\nDobbins ran the ball 24 times, averaged over 7 yards per carry and had an electrifying 67-yard breakaway for a touchdown late in the first half.\n\nFields finished 17 for 25 for 206 yards and threw an interception for the first time in his first 175 pass attempts as a Buckeye. He also was sacked three times \u2014 twice by linebacker Joe Bachie.\n\nNO. 5 LSU 42, UTAH STATE 6\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 Joe Burrow became the first LSU quarterback to eclipse 300 yards passing in four straight games and threw for five touchdowns against Utah State.\n\nBurrow completed 27 of 38 passes for 344 yards and was intercepted once on a tipped pass before being replaced by Myles Brennan in the fourth quarter. Burrow also rushed for 42 yards and a touchdown. He has completed 78.3 percent of his passes for 1,864 yards and 22 touchdowns through five games.\n\nJustin Jefferson caught two scoring passes for LSU (5-0). His second TD on a 39-yard throw was the completion on which Burrow surpassed 300 yards. Burrow's other TD strikes went to Derrick Dillon, JaMarr Chase and tight end Thaddeus Moss.\n\nThe Aggies (3-2) had 159 yards of offense.\n\nNO. 6 OKLAHOMA 45, KANSAS 20\n\nLAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Jalen Hurts threw for 228 yards and two touchdowns, ran for 56 yards and two more TDs and added another line to his Heisman Trophy resume in leading Oklahoma.\n\nRhamondre Stevenson added 109 yards rushing and a score on just five carries for Oklahoma. The Sooners (5-0, 2-0 Big 12) spotted Kansas (2-4, 0-2) a touchdown lead before ripping off seven straight scores.\n\nThat allowed them to cruise to their 22nd straight true road win, the second-longest streak since at least World War II in major college football. Bud Wilkinson's Sooners won 25 in a row from 1953-58. It also allowed Oklahoma to build momentum for next weekend's Red River Showdown with No. 11 Texas.\n\nNO. 8 WISCONSIN 48, KENT STATE 0\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Jonathan Taylor had four rushing touchdowns and caught a TD pass, Zack Baun had a career-high three sacks, and Wisconsin coasted to past Kent State.\n\nTaylor had 19 rushes for 186 yards, eclipsing the 100-yard mark for the 27th time in 32 career games with the Badgers (5-0).\n\nBaun's three sacks led a Wisconsin defense to its third shutout of the season. The Badgers held Kent State (2-3) to 124 yards of total offense. Chris Orr added two sacks for a unit that has allowed four touchdowns through five games.\n\nDustin Crum and Woody Barrett combined for just 64 yards on 10-of-17 passing.\n\nNO. 9 NOTRE DAME 52, BOWLING GREEN 0\n\nSOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) \u2014 Ian Book threw five touchdown passes and had only four incomplete passes in a little more than two quarters of work for Notre Dame.\n\nThe Fighting Irish (4-1) had their way with the Falcons (1-4), a first-time opponent from the Mid-American Conference whose campus is just 164 miles away. The margin matched Notre Dame's winning difference in a 66-14 victory over New Mexico this season and was Notre Dame's first shutout since 2014.\n\nThe Irish had 573 total yards, with senior Tony Jones Jr. rushing for 102 yards on seven carries. Notre Dame limited the Falcons (1-4) to 228 yards. Book was 16 of 20 for 261 yards.\n\nNO. 11 TEXAS 42, WEST VIRGINIA 31\n\nMORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) \u2014 Sam Ehlinger threw two touchdown passes and ran for two more scores and Texas converted three turnovers into TDs.\n\nTexas (4-1, 2-0 Big 12) beat the Mountaineers (3-2, 1-1) on the road for the second straight time.\n\nThe Longhorns had plenty of motivation for this one. Ehlinger and several Texas players were upset last year after several Mountaineers flashed \"horns down\" signs during West Virginia's 42-41 victory in Austin. Ehlinger noted in a tweet that was later deleted: \"Do not think it will be forgotten.\"\n\nEhlinger finished 18 of 33 for 211 yards. He threw just his second interception of the season that West Virginia turned into a third-quarter field goal.\n\nNO. 12 PENN STATE 35, PURDUE 7\n\nSTATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) \u2014 Sean Clifford threw for 264 yards with three touchdowns and ran for another score for Penn State.\n\nThe Nittany Lions (5-0, 2-0 Big Ten) were dominant on defense, with 10 sacks, one shy of the school single-game record. The Boilermakers were held to 104 yards.\n\nPlaying without starting quarterback Elijah Sindelar and star receiver Rondale Moore, the Boilermakers (1-4, 0-2) didn't cross midfield until their sixth possession midway through the second.\n\nPenn State jumped out fast, scoring on its first four drives, none lasting longer than 3:41.\n\nNO. 13 OREGON 17, CALIFORNIA 7\n\nEUGENE, Ore. (AP) \u2014 Justin Herbert threw for 214 yards and a late touchdown to extend his streak of consecutive games with a scoring pass to 33, and Oregon overcame an uncharacteristically slow start.\n\nOregon (4-1, 1-0 Pac-12) trailed until Cyrus Habibi-Likio's 1-yard touchdown run with 1:38 left in third quarter made it 10-7. Herbert's streak of TDs appeared in jeopardy until his short pass to Jaylon Redd with 7:14 to go in the game.\n\nThe Ducks, whose only loss came in the opener against Auburn, were held scoreless in the first half by the surprisingly resilient Golden Bears (4-2, 1-2).\n\nSTANFORD 23, NO. 15 WASHINGTON 13\n\nSTANFORD, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Cameron Scarlett rushed for a career-high 157 yards and a touchdown, quarterback Davis Mills had another impressive game in place of injured starter K.J. Costello before apparently getting hurt himself, and Stanford pulled off its biggest win of the season.\n\nThe Cardinal (3-3, 2-2 Pac-12) extended their home winning streak to six games, dating to 2007, against the Huskies with a plodding, methodical offense that kept Washington quarterback Jacob Eason on the sidelines for long chunks of the game.\n\nStanford dominated Washington (4-2, 1-2 Pac-12) in nearly every offensive category and held an 18-minute edge in time of possession.\n\nJet Toner added three field goals to help the Cardinal.\n\nMills was crisp until coming out of the game for an unknown reason in the middle of a scoring drive in the fourth quarter. Mills was 21-of-30 passing for 293 yards and a touchdown.\n\nEason was 15 of 35 for 181 yards, one touchdown and one interception.\n\nNO. 16 BOISE STATE 38, UNLV 13\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Hank Bachmeier threw for 299 yards and two touchdowns and Boise State used a strong defensive effort to beat UNLV.\n\nKhalil Shaker caught seven passes for 111 yards and a TD, John Hightower had four catches for 105 yards, including a 76-yard touchdown reception that make it 14-0 with 13:38 left until halftime for Boise State (5-0, 2-0 Mountain West).\n\nBoise State added in a 52-yard field goal from Joel Velazquez.\n\nUNLV's Kenyon Oblad, a redshirt freshman quarterback, made his first career start in place of Armani Rogers, who sprained a knee in last week's 53-17 loss at Wyoming.\n\nOblad was 24 for 55 for 262 yards passing and two touchdowns for the Rebels (1-4, 0-2). He had one interception.\n\nTEXAS TECH 45, NO, 21 OKLAHOMA STATE 35\n\nLUBBOCK, Texas (AP) \u2014 Jett Duffey threw four touchdown passes and ran for another score in his first start of the season, leading Texas Tech past Oklahoma State.\n\nTexas Tech (3-2, 1-1 Big 12), coming off a 55-16 loss at Oklahoma two weeks ago, built a 20-0 lead 30 seconds into the second quarter and won its second straight in the series after going 0-10-2 in the previous 12 meetings.\n\nDuffey completed 26 of 44 passes for 424 yards with scoring passes to Erik Ezukanma, T.J. Vashe, KeSean Carter and Dalton Rigdon. Duffey had a 16-yard touchdown run.\n\nOklahoma State (4-2, 1-2) committed five turnovers, three interceptions and two fumbles by redshirt freshman quarterback Spencer Sanders. Chuba Hubbard ran for 156 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nNO. 24 SMU 43, TULSA 37, 3OT\n\nDALLAS (AP) \u2014 Shane Buechele threw a 25-yard touchdown to James Proche in the third overtime and SMU beat Tulsa, coming back from a three-touchdown deficit in the fourth quarter to win in its first game as a ranked team in 33 years.\n\nAfter Tulsa missed its second field goal in overtime, Proche made a leaping catch in the front corner of the end zone over a defender and got a foot down before going out of bounds. The play was initially ruled incomplete before being overturned on replay review.\n\nSMU (6-0, 2-0 American) this week moved into the AP poll for the first time since October 1986, before NCAA sanctions that included the death penalty. The Mustangs didn't field a team in 1987 and 1988.\n\nXavier Jones ran for 121 yards and scored two game-tying touchdowns for SMU before he fumbled in the second overtime. But Tulsa couldn't take advantage when Jacob Rainey's 43-yard field goal attempt was wide left. Tusla (2-3, 0-1) had the ball to start the third overtime, and went to a different kicker after failing to get a first down. But Zack Long was wide left on a 42-yard attempt.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/APTop25CollegeFootballPoll and https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
