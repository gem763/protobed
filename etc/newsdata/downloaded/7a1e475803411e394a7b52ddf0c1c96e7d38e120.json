Today, the former first lady took to the app to praise Duchess Meghan, whom she called \"my friend,\" for the work she's doing during her royal tour of southern Africa.\n\n\n\nMeghan and Harry's trip abroad isn't just about the meet and greets and photo ops; it's also about recognizing and raising awareness about organizations doing inspiring work in the area. Last night, for example, the duke and duchess attended a reception for youth leaders, which included Obama Foundation Leaders based in Africa, who are notable rising change-makers in their communities.\n\nObama shared a photo from the event and dedicated an Instagram post to Duchess Meghan.\n\n\"Thank you to my friend, Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex @sussexroyal, a thoughtful leader who is breaking the mold and making our world better for it. Whether meeting with our @ObamaFoundation Leaders or helping girls around the world seek the education they deserve, she is an inspiration to so many.\"\n\nThe former first lady is a known advocate for girls' education worldwide and notably championed the cause in the White House with the Let Girls Learn initiative.
