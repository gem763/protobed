The better the health of the organization, the greater its potential to succeed.\u201d\n\nPenny Pennington,\n\nManaging partner, Edward Jones\n\nAlive at Work: The Neuroscience of Helping Your People Love What They Do, by Daniel Cable\n\n\u201cAlive at Work was recommended to me by Tim Welsh, vice chair of U.S. Bank. It\u2019s all about creating an environment in our organizations where every professional can connect their own personal \u2018why\u2019 to the mission of the organization. One of the compelling points Cable makes is that human beings are wired to be \u2018seekers.\u2019 We get meaning in our work when we are able to use our natural curiosity to seek better ideas and solutions.\u201d\n\nStephanie Chung,\n\nPresident, JetSuite\n\nConversational Intelligence: How Great Leaders Build Trust and Get Extraordinary Results, by Judith E. Glaser\n\n\u201cThis book, written by my mentor, who passed away last year, is one that I dust off and reread a few times every year. It\u2019s about the power of the conversation and how the brain reacts\u2014good or bad\u2014to the way information is delivered. The brain controls all of our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, yet we hardly acknowledge how it shows up in a conversation.\u201d\n\nDavid Frame, CEO, J.P. Morgan\n\nU.S. Wealth Management\n\nRange: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World, by David Epstein\n\n\u201cMuch has been written about the power of being a specialist, and committing to a specialty both early in life and in a career. This ranges from sports at a young age to anxiety around switching careers later in life. Range takes on this broad set of assumptions and makes the case for how building a wide range of skills can help you succeed at any age.\u201d\n\nLucas Zwirner,\n\nHead of content, David Zwirner\n\nAttention: Dispatches from a Land of Distraction, by Joshua Cohen\n\nThese Truths: A History of the United States, by Jill Lepore\n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m particularly drawn to books that help me understand the times we\u2019re in. The novelist Joshua Cohen\u2019s recent collection of essays, Attention: Dispatches from a Land of Distraction, deals with basically every aspect of modern life\u2014from the literary to the banal, corrupt, and absurd.\n\nJill Lepore\u2019s These Truths: A History of the United States is probably the best single-volume history of the United States now in existence. It puts the horrors of slavery front and center, and it should be on everyone\u2019s reading list.\u201d", "description": "From a history of the U.S. to works on personal and organizational growth", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-101417/social", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
