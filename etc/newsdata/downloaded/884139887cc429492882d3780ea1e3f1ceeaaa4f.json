However, the number of Independents rose again to 21 after Amber Rudd quit the Tory whip by choice.", "description": "The MPs who have had the whip restored include Winston Churchill's grandson Sir Nicholas Soames", "authors": ["Dan Bloom"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20752240.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
