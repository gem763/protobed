For months, North Korean officials delayed restarting these lower-level discussions, placing U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the humiliating position of repeatedly promising that negotiations would resume in \u201ca couple of weeks.\u201d And when the North Koreans finally agreed to them, they announced that the talks would last only one day. Soon afterward, Kim\u2019s government announced the successful test of a new submarine-launched ballistic missile, capping a spate of shorter-range-missile tests that has significantly advanced its nuclear-weapons arsenal.\n\nAnd fail they did, at least for the moment. In a statement read shortly after the negotiations ended within hours of beginning\u2014so shortly after, in fact, it raised suspicions that this was Pyongyang\u2019s plan all along\u2014the chief North Korean negotiator, Kim Myong Gil, blamed the \u201cbreakdown\u201d on his U.S. counterparts not coming to the table with fresh ideas, and suggested that talks be suspended until the end of the year, a period that North Korean officials have ominously described as a deadline for Washington to adopt a more flexible position.\n\nRead: The day denuclearization died\n\nU.S. negotiators tried to cast the impasse in the best light, stating that they\u2019d raised \u201cnew initiatives\u201d and describing the discussions as \u201cgood.\u201d They noted that the United States and North Korea \u201cwill not overcome a legacy of 70 years of war and hostility on the Korean peninsula through the course of a single Saturday,\u201d and that they sought \u201cmore intensive engagement\u201d and another meeting in the optimistic Pompeoian time frame of a couple of weeks.\n\nThe North Korean delegation, however, appeared unwilling to enter into a substantive and structured diplomatic process, let alone technical conversations about dismantling the country\u2019s nuclear program. Instead of presenting themselves as the empowered negotiators U.S. officials had hoped to finally confront after previous rounds of abortive working-level nuclear talks, the North Koreans seemed to once again be primarily in listening mode.\n\n\u201cRather than the breakdown of talks, what we are seeing resembles classic North Korean negotiating tactics: demand more concessions, minimize denuclearization commitments, and figure out how to cheat,\u201d Easley told me by email. \u201cKim Myong Gil does not have authority to compromise on anything until approved by Kim Jong Un. He probably went to Stockholm with talking points and instructions to receive the updated U.S. position before walking out to buy time and apply pressure.\u201d", "description": "One of the downsides of highly personalized diplomacy is that when the person in question is debilitated, the diplomacy suffers.", "authors": ["Uri Friedman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTX7699F/facebook.jpg?1570560507", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
