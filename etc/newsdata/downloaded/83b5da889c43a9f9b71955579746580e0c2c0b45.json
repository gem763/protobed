There has never been any such thing in the history of the Turkish republic as the state sitting at the same table with a terror organisation,\" he said in an address to the Turkish parliament.\n\nIn an even blunter rejection of the US request, he told Turkish journalists: \"They tell us 'to declare a ceasefire'. We can never declare a ceasefire.\"\n\nHowever, his aides retracted a statement by the president saying he would refuse to meet Mr Pence.\n\nIn what looked like an extraordinary snub, Mr Erdogan told Sky News on Wednesday when asked about Mr Pence and Mr Pompeo: \"I am standing tall. I will not meet with them. They will meet with their counterparts. I will speak when Trump comes,\" he said.\n\nA spokesman for Mr Erdogan quickly retracted the statement, saying that Mr Erdogan does indeed intend to meet Mr Pence.\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan said he would not halt the Turkish offensive against Kurdish forces in northern Syria Credit: Aytac Unal/ Anadolu More\n\nTurkey launched an invasion of Kurdish-controlled northeastern Syria a week ago, days after Donald Trump announced he was ordering a withdrawal of US troops who had been fighting alongside the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces against Islamic State.\n\nThe formerly US-allied Kurdish leadership announced they had agreed to align with Russia and the Syrian government, American rivals, in a bid to halt the Turkish attack on Sunday night.\n\nRussian and Syrian forces took over abandoned US positions near the strategic town of Manbij on Tuesday.\n\nThe move upended the geo-political balance in the region and left Russia as the undisputed power-broker in Syria and greatly enhanced its influence in the wider Middle East.\n\nThe Kremlin said Mr Erdogan accepted an invitation to Moscow in the coming days during a phone call with Mr Putin on Tuesday night.\n\nThe two presidents discussed the need to \"prevent conflict between units of the Turkish army and Syrian government armed forces,\" it said in a readout posted on its website.\n\nVladimir Putin met Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Tuesday Credit: ALEXEY NIKOLSKY/SPUTNIK/KREMLIN POOL/EPA-EFE/REX More", "description": "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president of Turkey, has refused to meet with a\u00a0delegation led by\u00a0US vice president Mike Pence and rejected US calls to halt his offensive in northern Syria.
