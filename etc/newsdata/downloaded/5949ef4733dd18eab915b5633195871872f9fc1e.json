Since the show debuted, it has presented a question: Which one of these three children (with apologies to Connor, but let\u2019s be real) will inherit Logan\u2019s kingdom? But there are also other kinds of bequests in the ether, as the scars on Logan\u2019s back\u2014paid forward as psychological wounds to his children and grandchildren\u2014made clear. And so the question gets an extra dimension: Which of his children is Logan\u2019s emotional heir, hungry and empty enough inside to meet his standards for an acceptable successor?\n\nIn Season 1, the obvious candidate was Kendall, with his Forbes covers, his desperate need to prove himself, and his multiple boardroom-coup efforts against his father. \u201cI\u2019m just concerned you might be soft,\u201d Logan told Kendall early on, noting that business was essentially \u201ca big-dick competition\u201d; his son, cosseted by luxury his entire life, couldn\u2019t measure up. \u201cThe only way he\u2019ll respect you is if you try to destroy him,\u201d Roman told Kendall midway through the first season. \u201cBecause, in your position, that is exactly what he\u2019d try to do.\u201d That same episode, a frustrated Logan physically lashed out at Kendall\u2019s son, as if to remind Kendall that aspiring to be more like his father would come with obvious costs. In the end, Kendall\u2019s own frailty gave his father a winning hand, and led to Kendall trudging wearily in Logan\u2019s wake for most of Season 2.\n\nAt the same time, Shiv\u2019s stock was rising. There\u2019s no doubt at this point that Shiv is the Roy child most closely akin to her father\u2014the most ambitious sibling, the most manipulative, and the least troubled by the little things, like empathy or guilt. (\u201cThis class-war shit\u2014don\u2019t you find it a little jejune?\u201d is up there with \u201cLet them eat cake\u201d as a succinct encapsulation of personal callousness.) \u201cMy philosophy is, I literally don\u2019t give a fuck,\u201d Shiv told Nate (Ashley Zukerman) in bed while he was browsing his wedding registry; the personal motto applies to table napkins and china patterns, but also to the world at large. In Season 1, Shiv conspired with a senator who wanted to burn her father\u2019s news empire to the ground. In Season 2, as Logan dangled the throne in front of her like a cat toy, Shiv was made newly vulnerable by the prospect of something she actually really wanted. Initially thrown off course, she was back at Logan\u2019s side by \u201cDundee.\u201d There, Shiv set up Rhea (Holly Hunter) to fail (in a way that would facilitate Shiv\u2019s path to the top job) and sweet-talked a woman victimized by Waystar into backing down.\n\nRead: The \u2018Succession\u2019 kids finally understand their power\n\nLast night, on board the Roy yacht, a craft as sharp and black as a kitchen knife, Logan let his children and consiglieres fight it out to see which one should suffer the sins of the company. It was a classic Roy reunion\u2014there were no actual shouts of \u201cBoar on the floor,\u201d but the internecine conflicts and poisonous power struggles were the same. Roman, newly chastened by his brush with political kidnapping, couldn\u2019t begin to compete: Having recently pleaded with his siblings to \u201ctalk to each other? Normally?\u201d and opened up about how frightened he was in Turkey, he was far too tenderhearted to do more than defend Gerri (J. Smith-Cameron) and implicate Tom. Shiv, Tom\u2019s own wife, agreed that Tom was a logical choice, leading him to lambaste her as they lay sunbathing in a private cove. \u201cIf I think about it, a lot of the time I\u2019m pretty unhappy,\u201d Tom said. \u201cI wonder if the sad I\u2019d be without you would be less than the sad I get from being with you.\u201d", "description": "The HBO show had teased a \u201cblood sacrifice\u201d in its thrilling season finale, and it didn\u2019t disappoint.", "authors": ["Sophie Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/278d5a98b98ef72264e93a7dbadac5f6c5c91a070e9fff95055d9c0f583432bbe819ecaa69cc6faa1dea0c813fa4a519-1/facebook.jpg?1571063741", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
