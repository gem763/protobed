But I wasn't the only doubter. Many This is Money regulars used our then new 'reader comments' facility to share their concerns about the debt boom, profligate Labour spending and much more besides.\n\n\n\nBack then, the site's audience measured fewer than 300,000. Today's ABCe - the industry-wide count - puts it at more than three million with an average 145,000 dipping in each day, up 25% in the past year alone.\n\n\n\nThis increase is partly due to the dramatic surge in interest in all things financial. It also has a lot to do with the expertise of the many talented journalists I've had the privilege to work with.\n\nOur campaigns have included dogged pursuit of ticket reselling rip-offs, exposing exorbitant bank charges and the mis-selling of payment protection insurance.\n\n\n\nMore recently we have fought to highlight the injustice faced by those reliant on income, as the measures deployed to tackle the financial crisis unfairly punish those who actually bothered to save.\n\n\n\nAnd our recent investigation has exposed to the extent to which banks, seemingly unable to learn from their mistakes, are still pressuring staff to hard-sell products.\n\n\n\nI'm also particularly proud of the way my team has responded to emails from desperate readers, wronged by financial services companies and fought their corner, often winning compensation.\n\n\n\nToday, I leave you in the capable hands of those colleagues as I move on to a new opportunity at the Telegraph. So I thank you for reading, sharing your wisdom and for helping to create, in my humble opinion, Britain's best money website.\n\n\n\nI wish you a very prosperous future.\n\n\n\n@andrew_oxlade", "description": "Much has changed since I was made Editor of This is Money seven years ago.
