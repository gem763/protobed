Allen Brack has issued the company\u2019s first public statement since its decision to ban an esports competitor and withhold his prize money for making statements supporting the protests in Hong Kong at a Blizzard-sponsored event.\n\nThe company has been accused of prioritising its relationships with China rather than protecting the right to free speech, which Brack denied: \u201cI want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision.\u201d\n\nBrack said the company\u2019s relationships in China were not a factor in the decision to punish Blitzchung, but the initial punishment may have been too harsh.\n\nBrack shortened Blitzchung\u2019s one-year suspension down to six months, and said it would be giving a suspension of the same length for the two commentators who conducted the interview. Brack also said Blitzchung \u201cshould receive his prizing\u201d from the tournament, which would be several thousand dollars.\n\nHowever, it said Blitzchung and the two broadcasters should have kept the focus of the interview on the event, and that it stood by the decision to take action.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nBlizzard Entertainment President J.Allen Brack has issued the company\u2019s first public statement since making the decision to punish Chung Ng Wai, better known as Blitzchung \u2013 a \u201cHearthstone\u201d esports competitor who spoke out in favour of the protests in Hong Kong.\n\nBrack\u2019s statement pushed back against the accusation that Blizzard made the decision to punish Blitzchung in order to protect its business interests in China.\n\n\u201cThe specific views expressed by blitzchung were NOT a factor in the decision we made. I want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nBlitzchung wore a gas mask and called for the liberation of Hong Kong during a post-match interview on October 5. Blizzard responded by banning him from competition for one year, and saying that it would no longer work with the two commentators who conducted the interview. It also said at the time it would withhold several thousand dollars in prize money from Blitzchung.\n\nNow, Brack said that Blitzchung and the two commentators conducting the interview had indeed broken the rules of the competition by not keeping the focus on the game. Ultimately, Brack wrote, Blitzchung had been punished not for his specific views, but rather for distracting away from the tournament by raising a political issue.\n\nHowever, Brack said, the intial punishment may have been too harsh, and cut the one-year suspension to a six-month span. It also said that the two commentators would be given the same-length suspension, apparently rather than cutting ties entirely.\n\n\u201cThere is a consequence for taking the conversation away from the purpose of the event and disrupting or derailing the broadcast,\u201d Brack\u2019s statement reads. \u201cWith regard to the casters, remember their purpose is to keep the event focused on the tournament. That didn\u2019t happen here, and we are setting their suspension to six months as well.\u201d\n\nBrack also said blitzchung \u201cshould receive his prizing\u201d but did not specify how much or when it would be paid out.\n\nCritics, including Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, claimed earlier this week that Blizzard\u2019s punishment was an act of censorship designed to protect the company\u2019s interests in China.\n\nOver the course of the four days after the original event, a group of about 30 Blizzard employees staged a walkout at the company\u2019s California studio, a pair of \u201cHeartstone\u201d commentators resigned from participating in the finals broadcast, and dozens of players took to social media to share pictures of themselves deleting their Blizzard accounts and cancelling their World of Warcraft subscriptions under the hashtag \u201c#BoycottBlizzard.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Brack\u2019s new statement will quell the fires, or just stoke further protest.\n\nYou can read Blizzard CEO J. Allen Brack\u2019s full statement below:\n\nHello Blizzard Community . . .\n\nI want to take a few minutes to talk to all of you about the Hearthstone Grandmasters tournament this past weekend. On Monday, we made the decision to take action against a player named blitzchung and two shoutcasters after the player shared his views on what\u2019s happening in Hong Kong on our official broadcast channel.\n\nAt Blizzard, our vision is \u201cto bring the world together through epic entertainment.\u201d And we have core values that apply here: Think Globally; Lead Responsibly; and importantly, Every Voice Matters, encouraging everybody to share their point of view. The actions that we took over the weekend are causing people to question if we are still committed to these values. We absolutely are and I will explain.\n\nOur esports programs are an expression of our vision and our values. Esports exist to create opportunities for players from around the world, from different cultures, and from different backgrounds, to come together to compete and share their passion for gaming. It is extremely important to us to protect these channels and the purpose they serve: to bring the world together through epic entertainment, celebrate our players, and build diverse and inclusive communities.\n\nAs to how those values apply in this case:\n\nFirst, our official esports tournament broadcast was used as a platform for a winner of this event to share his views with the world.\n\nWe interview competitors who are at the top of their craft to share how they feel. We want to experience that moment with them. Hearing their excitement is a powerful way to bring us together.\n\nOver the weekend, blitzchung used his segment to make a statement about the situation in Hong Kong-in violation of rules he acknowledged and understood, and this is why we took action.\n\nEvery Voice Matters, and we strongly encourage everyone in our community to share their viewpoints in the many places available to express themselves. However, the official broadcast needs to be about the tournament and to be a place where all are welcome. In support of that, we want to keep the official channels focused on the game.\n\nSecond, what is the role of shoutcasters for these broadcasts?\n\nWe hire shoutcasters to amplify the excitement of the game. They elevate the watchability and help the esports viewing experience stay focused on the tournament and our amazing players.\n\nThird, were our actions based on the content of the message?\n\nPart of Thinking Globally, Leading Responsibly, and Every Voice Matters is recognising that we have players and fans in almost every country in the world. Our goal is to help players connect in areas of commonality, like their passion for our games, and create a sense of shared community.\n\nThe specific views expressed by blitzchung were NOT a factor in the decision we made. I want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision.\n\nWe have these rules to keep the focus on the game and on the tournament to the benefit of a global audience, and that was the only consideration in the actions we took.\n\nIf this had been the opposing viewpoint delivered in the same divisive and deliberate way, we would have felt and acted the same.\n\nOK, what could Blizzard have done better, and where do we go from here?\n\nOver the past few days, many players, casters, esports fans, and employees have expressed concerns about how we determined the penalties. We\u2019ve had a chance to pause, to listen to our community, and to reflect on what we could have done better. In hindsight, our process wasn\u2019t adequate, and we reacted too quickly.\n\nWe want to ensure that we maintain a safe and inclusive environment for all our players, and that our rules and processes are clear. All of this is in service of another important Blizzard value-Play Nice; Play Fair.\n\nIn the tournament itself blitzchung *played* fair. We now believe he should receive his prizing. We understand that for some this is not about the prize, and perhaps for others it is disrespectful to even discuss it. That is not our intention.\n\nBut playing fair also includes appropriate pre-and post-match conduct, especially when a player accepts recognition for winning in a broadcast. When we think about the suspension, six months for blitzchung is more appropriate, after which time he can compete in the Hearthstone pro circuit again if he so chooses. There is a consequence for taking the conversation away from the purpose of the event and disrupting or derailing the broadcast.\n\nWith regard to the casters, remember their purpose is to keep the event focused on the tournament. That didn\u2019t happen here, and we are setting their suspension to six months as well.\n\nMoving forward, we will continue to apply tournament rules to ensure our official broadcasts remain focused on the game and are not a platform for divisive social or political views.\n\nOne of our goals at Blizzard is to make sure that every player, everywhere in the world, regardless of political views, religious beliefs, race, gender, or any other consideration always feels safe and welcome both competing in and playing our games.\n\nAt Blizzard, we are always listening and finding ways to improve-it is part of our culture. Thank you for your patience with us as we continue to learn.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJ.
