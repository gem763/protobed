I thought we were cool!! You over there feeling suicidal Tony?\u201d Jones tweeted.\n\nWhen Jones\u2019 tweet was met with heavy criticism from fans, he deleted it after about 30 minutes and issued an initial apology that has also since-been deleted.\n\n\u201cDefinitely should\u2019ve used a better choice of words, deleted that last tweet. My fault, I\u2019m sorry guys,\u201d Jones tweeted.\n\nJones followed up that apology tweet with a second one.\n\n\u201cDefinitely knew nothing about my guy having any mental health issues, I do now though,\u201d Jones tweeted. \u201cI apologize for my response back to him and moving on.\u201d\n\nWhen a Twitter user expressed doubt about Jones playing ignorant, Jones fired back with a quote tweet doubling down that he never knew of Ferguson\u2019s recent past.\n\n\u201cYeah bro, I just show up and kick a few asses a few times a year,\u201d Jones tweeted. \u201cDon\u2019t really sit around and read other fighters [sic] articles.\u201d\n\nFerguson\u2019s case became public last March after MMA Junkie broke the news of his wife filing a restraining order against him. In it, she she described Ferguson\u2019s \u201cparanoid and delusional\u201d behavior, including that he \u201ckept throwing holy water\u201d at her and tearing up their fire place because he believed \u201csomeone was inside his walls.\u201d She also said Ferguson pushed her and her mother.\n\nFerguson\u2019s wife later dropped the restraining order after he received treatment. In May, he was cleared by the UFC to return and booked to fight Donald Cerrone in June at UFC 238, where he won by second-round TKO.\n\nFerguson, who\u2019s on a 12-fight winning streak, currently sits as the No. 1 contender to the lightweight title. He\u2019s in line to challenge champion Khabib Nurmagomedov, who\u2019s stated he\u2019d like to make the fight for February or March 2020.\n\nJones, meanwhile, had been hoping to fight once more this year after defending his title twice in 2019, but that appears unlikely to happen. He\u2019s now targeting a return for early 2020.\n\nEarlier this month, Jones took a plea deal in his hometown of Albuquerque, N.M., pleading no contest to disorderly conduct for an April incident at a local strip club where a cocktail waitress alleged he grabbed her vagina and picked her up off the ground.\n\nGallery Photos: Jon Jones through the years view 53 images", "description": "Jon Jones deleted his tweet and apologized for it, but claims he never knew of Tony Ferguson's mental health issues from earlier this year.", "authors": ["Simon Samano", "Abbey Subhan", "Mma Junkie Staff", "The Blue Corner", "Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "Dan Tom", "Simon Head"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/jon-jones-tony-ferguson.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
