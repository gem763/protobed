Because he\u2019s a conservative president", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cFor many decades,\u201d the president declared at the signing ceremony, \u201cfederal agencies have been issuing thousands of pages of so-called \u2018guidance\u2019 documents \u2014 a pernicious kind of regulation imposed by unaccountable bureaucrats in the form of commentary on how rules should be interpreted. All too often, guidance documents are a backdoor for regulators to effectively change the laws and vastly expand their scope and reach. Guidance has frequently been used to subject U.S. citizens and businesses to arbitrary and sometimes abusive enforcement actions.\u201d\n\nAfter joking that he himself might have been the target of such \u201cguidance letters\u201d in the past, Trump hit the crucial note: \u201cBecause of these materials and the fact that these materials are too often hidden and hard to find, many Americans learn of the rules only when federal agents come knocking on the door,\u201d he declared. \u201cThis regulatory overreach gravely undermines our constitutional system of government.\u201d\n\nReally? How could the alleged destroyer of democracy make such an argument? He explained: \u201cUnelected, unaccountable bureaucrats must not be able to operate outside of the democratic system of government, imposing their own private agenda on our citizens.\u201d And certainly not by unsupervised regulatory statists.", "description": "", "authors": ["Hugh Hewitt", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Why-Do-Conservatives-Support-Trump-Because-Hes-Conservative-President"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
