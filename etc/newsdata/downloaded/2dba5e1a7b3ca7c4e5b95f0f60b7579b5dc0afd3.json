Until next year.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick look at what\u2019s going down at a few of the main pop-ups next week \u2013 because quite the best thing about being in the Birdcage is ogling all the hats. The chef\u2019s hats, that is.\n\nLandmark by Lexus\n\nMatt Stone and Jo Barrett are bringing Australian ingredients to the table at the Lexus marquee.\n\nAs principal partner of the Victoria Racing Club, Lexus gets prime real estate, a mammoth, three-storey build and some seriously in-demand chefs as their brand ambassadors, backed up by The Big Group.\n\nTranslating the brand\u2019s values \u2013 Japanese hospitality and craftsmanship, Australian sustainability and native ingredients \u2013 onto the plate this time round will be Matt Stone and Jo Barrett of Yarra Valley\u2019s Oakridge (smoked trout and caraway croissant; spent gin orange parfait); Neil Perry (bento boxes from Sak\u00e9, fresh crumpets, a BLT and gnocchi fritter with prosciutto from R Bar at Crown) and, on the ground level, the team from Eazy Peazy, serving up yakitori fresh off the hibachi grill.\n\nGin orange parfait with poppy seed and cultured butter, anyone?\n\nPlus, guests can grab a glass of wellness at low-alcohol bar Byrdi, or just soak up the booze with Neil\u2019s race-day faves of sausage rolls, finger sandwiches and fries with togarashi.\n\n\u201cBy 3pm, no one\u2019s gluten-free any more,\u201d says The Big Group\u2019s executive chef Lisa Bolle. \u201cThey\u2019re all smashing cheeseburgers by then.\u201d\n\nBiggest change the caterers have seen over the past couple of years?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe rise of vegans and social influencers,\u201d says Bolle. \u201cThe influencers just take photos of the food and don\u2019t eat it. And they don\u2019t engage with anyone, either.\u201d\n\nMaison Mumm Hotel\n\nDan Hong puts the finishing touches to delectables designed for Maison Mumm Hotel.\n\nThe Melbourne Cup Carnival marks the official launch down south of made by Merivale, the off-site catering branch of Justin Hemmes\u2019 all-conquering Sydney restaurant group. And the jewel in the racing crown for the newbies is the Maison Mumm Hotel, claimed to be \u201cthe first luxury hotel-inspired marquee\u201d in the Birdcage. Your personal chef during your stay? Dan Hong, fresh from opening new restaurant Lotus 2.0 in Sydney\u2019s Potts Point.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in my comfort zone, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d says Hong of his four-day gig. \u201cFor one I\u2019m in Melbourne, and second, the kitchen is a trestle table out the back.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s likely he\u2019ll pull himself together in time to get into the \u201cfun, party, champagne-and-dancing\u201d swing of things. Among Hong\u2019s Asian-inflected, Mumm-friendly food will be duck rillettes banh mi with pickled carrot, daikon and coriander; and crispy bug tails wrapped in brik pastry with seaweed salt and saffron aioli. And for the hotel\u2019s super-exclusive, secret RSRV room? Prestige Mumm Cuv\u00e9es and choux puffs with lobster, lime, cr\u00e8me fraiche and caviar.\n\nNo word yet on whether guests can check in for an overnight stay, however.\n\nTabcorp\n\nExpect Italian delights including casarecce with spiced veal ragu from Guy Grossi. Simon Schluter\n\nNo collection of pop-ups would be complete without a nod to the year\u2019s hottest restaurant trend, Italian. Enter Tabcorp, with Cup veteran Guy Grossi in the Italian corner and desserts maestro Darren Purchese, of Burch & Purchese, flying the Aussie flag. Well, it\u2019s just the spot to have a bet each way. And that means saddling up with casarecce with spiced veal ragu; crocchette di baccal\u00e0; milk bun with cotoletta and Italian slaw; and winding down at the marquee\u2019s champagne and pavlova bar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAn iconic Australian dessert for an iconic Australian event!\u201d says Purchese, who\u2019ll also be serving his signature tube desserts including coconut, passionfruit, ginger and mint, and explosive raspberry.\n\nPeter Rowland's golden beetroot croissant filled with hummus and walnut salsa.\n\nOur pick of the food\n\nGolden beetroot \u201ccroissant\u201d \u2013 Peter Rowland\n\nOfficial VRC catering partner since 1996, Peter Rowland is this year taking its first-class food to a wider audience at Flemington by catering to private parties in The Rails (aka the car park). PR executive chef Matthew Haigh\u2019s golden beetroot \u201ccroissant\u201d is a tiny delight, a visual play on the pastry wrapped around Milawa blue cheese.\n\nFalafel fattoush with green tahini and pickled radish \u2013 The Big Group\n\nOne of the more substantial dishes from The Big Group, and very Yotam Ottolenghi. The mini falafel balls are as light as air, the tahini stripes add richness and the acid balance of the salad is spot-on. It\u2019s also vegan and gluten-free.\n\nLady Helena\u2019s Eton Mess \u2013 food &desire\n\nEton Mess is one of those adaptable sweets that can either be simple or complex. This version is firmly in the latter camp, with so many different elements the result is as much like trifle as Eton Mess. You might think that a collision of white and lavender meringue clouds, candied rose petals, freeze-dried fruits, passionfruit curd, vanilla bean cream, lemon mist and rose oil would be all a bit OTT, but you\u2019d be wrong. It\u2019s sensational, and not too sweet. Find it at 1 Oliver Street, one of two marquees serviced by Birdcage first-timer food &desire.\n\nChicken sandwich \u2013 Peter Rowland\n\nLine up all the Peter Rowland chicken sandwiches that get eaten every year at Spring Carnival time and they\u2019d go round the track two-and-a-half times. We love a cute statistic, and we love this sambo \u2013 so simple, so perfect. And this year, for the first time, they\u2019re making a gluten-free version, a \u201cchicken glass sandwich\u201d, with crispy chicken skin standing in for the bread.", "description": "If you\u2019re lucky enough to enjoy the Melbourne Cup from the Birdcage, expect an extra treat this year: the culinary form has never looked so good.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2364%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_580/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a3c42d9ca0bf6b9f0568ab0e0df31ff14deb7ecc", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
