Stuart Travis/Cond\u00e9 Nast/Getty (left); Helen Dryden/Cond\u00e9 Nast/Getty (right)\n\nIn 1902, Nast married Clarisse Coudert, socialite and heiress of the Coudert Brothers law firm fortune. The couple had two children, but in 1906 Clarisse escaped to Europe, with Nast\u2019s blessing, to work on her somewhat questionable singing. (There she got to know Rilke, Rodin, and Gertrude Stein, but never got involved much in her husband\u2019s business.) Nast kicked off his entrepreneurship in the field of dress patterns, where he pioneered the creation of clothing sizes with the Home Pattern Company. The media business started in earnest with his purchase in 1909 of Vogue, an embattled New York society magazine founded in 1892 that featured interior decorating and theater gossip alongside fashion. The problem with the magazine was simple, Ronald writes: \u201cVogue did not appeal to a moneyed, aspirational readership.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Cond\u00e9 Nast formula emerged in his makeover of the magazine. Nast changed Vogue\u2019s frequency from weekly to bimonthly; upped the number of pages, newsstand price, and ad volume; installed a new art director, Heyworth Campbell; and embraced photography, one of Nast\u2019s personal passions. Nast also kept on Vogue\u2019s matriarch, Edna Woolman Chase, who remained there through 1952. The result was a commercial and cultural success.\n\n\u201cClass publications\u201d were literally predicated on economic inequality\u2014they just made it look good.\n\nNast emerges as the first great connoisseur of editorial talent on an industrial scale. He was a curator of publications, editors, writers, photographers, and illustrators, picking up one creative after another and adding them to his collection, keeping them satisfied with promotions and ostentatious perks, which included paying off one editor\u2019s mortgage. Most of his biggest titles were those he acquired and renovated, like decrepit houses with good bones, rather than started from scratch. In 1913, he acquired the small magazine Dress and the rights to the title Vanity Fair and combined them; he bought House & Garden the same year.\n\nDress and Vanity Fair initially bombed, but then Nast brought in Frank Crowninshield as editor-in-chief, \u201cthe quintessential Edwardian gentleman,\u201d Ronald writes, a Boston Brahmin whose friends called him Crownie\u2014Manhattan\u2019s arbiter of elegance. \u201cThere is no magazine that is read by the people you meet at lunches and dinners,\u201d he suggested. \u201cYour magazine should cover the things people talk about\u2014parties, the arts, sports, theater, humor, and so forth.\u201d Indeed. Crowninshield shortened the name to just Vanity Fair and put out a manifesto in his first issue affirming \u201cthe progress and promise of American life\u201d as well as feminism and the intelligence of women. Crowninshield shepherded stars like Dorothy Parker, Aldous Huxley, T.S. Eliot, Gertrude Stein, and Djuna Barnes into his pages, mingling high society concerns with the artistic avant-garde, social moralism with luxury consumerism. It was the birth of a lifestyle-magazine format that persists today in much smaller twenty-first\u2013century print magazines like Monocle and Kinfolk.\n\nThe growing company also established the concept of magazines as replicable brands, further expanding their reach. A British version of Vogue launched in 1916, in part due to difficulty shipping American copies through the World War I German blockade in the Atlantic, and French Vogue in 1920. The international editions, partnerships between the mothership and local agents, further represented a shift in the center of global taste from London and Paris to New York and Hollywood. Where American Vogue was once an importer of taste, now it was an exporter.\n\nCond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s magazines were a mirror for the early twentieth century\u2019s caf\u00e9 society, composed of the wealthy socialites, premade celebrities, and upwardly mobile bohemians whom Nast hosted at sloppy parties in his penthouse, even through Prohibition (though he preferred to retreat behind closed doors with a few people while his soir\u00e9es raged on). The pages gave this class a self-consciousness and also displayed them to the reading public, projecting what might have been fame only within the realm of the 400 to an audience of millions, who learned to desire what they had. This group provided both a subject and a business model. \u201cClass publications\u201d were literally predicated on economic inequality\u2014they just made it look good.\n\nThe company had its ups and downs, including a brush with bankruptcy when Nast overinvested with friends at Goldman Sachs just before the Great Depression. Vanity Fair was folded into Vogue in 1936, not to be resurrected again until the wealth-worshipping 1980s. But the empire remained aloof from its competitors, higher-brow than Harold Ross\u2019s New Yorker (then owned by the yeast millionaire Raoul Fleischmann) and smarter than the magazine stable of its archrival, Hearst (Cosmopolitan, Town & Country, Good Housekeeping). Nast\u2019s philosophy of aspiration never changed. Budgets weren\u2019t a concern as long as the image the magazines projected was so irresistible that readers and advertisers just had to take part.\n\nGlamour, launched in 1939, was Nast\u2019s last personal creation. He died of a heart attack on September 19, 1942, after a long struggle with his blood pressure. The kingdom lived on, though Nast\u2019s possessions were auctioned off to service debts from the crash. In 1959, the newspaper magnate Samuel I. Newhouse bought the entirety of Cond\u00e9 Nast, the story goes, because his wife, Mitzi Epstein, liked Vogue. Samuel and then his son Si (who passed away in 2017) expanded the company to the form we know today, acquiring yet more titles, including The New Yorker, Gourmet, and GQ, and relaunching Vanity Fair. Si was another quiet editorial curator, arranging or sacrificing his deputies like so many chess pieces to maintain the company\u2019s sparkling image: forever new, fresh, modern.\n\nReading the recent memoirs of Cond\u00e9 Nast editors recounting the Si Newhouse boom years can induce an eerie nostalgia. Executives blissfully squander their budgets, unaware of the specter of banner ads, like beachgoers before a tsunami. Is it even possible that the media industry once functioned this way, and that the personal and editorial luxuries they describe were not only feasible but profitable? You want to cry out to warn them.\n\nOn January 1, 1984, a British woman in her early thirties named Tina Brown was appointed editor-in-chief of Newhouse\u2019s reboot of Vanity Fair. The wunderkind editor of the London society magazine Tatler, Brown did a stint of consulting with Cond\u00e9 Nast but was soon convinced she had to wrest control of the magazine to make it relevant. (\u201cI will do a good, jazzy job for you, Si, if you want me,\u201d was her all-or-nothing pitch to Newhouse.) Brown did readers and media historians a favor in 2017, when she published her diaries from the decade, during which she turned the magazine into one of the most visible in the world. The Vanity Fair Diaries: 1983\u20131992 is like one running tabloid headline: snappy, smart, and suspenseful (not rarely alliterative), caught in the moment of never knowing what\u2019s coming next, success or failure. To her, New York was the \u201cwhite-hot center\u201d and the Cond\u00e9 Nast empire, \u201clike ancient Rome with all the politics and secrets, everything revolving round Si as Emperor Augustus,\u201d the tastemaker-in-chief.\n\nBrown revered the corporation\u2019s eponymous founder and his \u201cclass not mass\u201d approach to audience. For her new Vanity Fair, she revived the old mandate to cover things that rich people talk about at parties. It was high-end general interest, executed by writers like Gail Sheehy and Dominick Dunne, with photography from Annie Leibovitz and Helmut Newton. Over her first issues, Brown found an editorial formula, or what she patented as The Mix. It embraced both highbrow and lowbrow, and it was always expensive to produce: \u201cCeleb cover to move the newsstand, juicy news narrative \u2026 A-list literary piece, visual escapism, revealing political profile, fashion. If we nail each of these per issue it\u2019s gonna work,\u201d she summarizes. The essential element of her aspirational magazine is something instructive, \u201ca satiating story, the one that tells you, the reader, who you are or who you want to be.\u201d\n\nThe diaries are a litany of dinners, good and bad, parties, good and bad, and real estate, mostly good. Just as Nast embedded himself amid the 400, Brown got her editorial ideas from the people around her. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how I always dread going out and then get so much out of it when I do. Social life is the trigger for all the best stories I have ever got,\u201d she writes. Her tablemates became the subjects of covers, profiles, and reviews, which caused some conflicts but ultimately increased the sense of coherence with which she projected her cultural class to the world. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hairy when the best stories right now are attached to a group I also socialize with,\u201d she admits.\n\nThere was a hopefulness in Brown\u2019s desire to define a single, prevailing cultural agenda, as if a cover photo of a pregnant Demi Moore could heal national wounds. (\u201cThis is what a celebrity looks like in the nineties. Not just natural but au naturel!\u201d) The amount of time she spends dwelling on proper page order and compelling captions\u2014magazines as holistic objets d\u2019art\u2014is staggering for anyone who entered the industry in the digital era, when those elements of magazine-making are either nonexistent or meaningless in the face of search-engine optimization. \u201cThe more fragmented we become as a culture, the more the media holds us together,\u201d she writes in 1989. \u201cAmericans have less and less in common as a people, but we all watch the same TV shows and the same movies.\u201d Or we did until we hit the Streaming Wars. It\u2019s hard not to reflect that Brown\u2019s domination as a tastemaker was allied with the near-monopoly major corporations had on America\u2019s viewing, listening, and reading habits, which has broken down of late. Newhouse, for example, also happened to own Random House from 1980 to 1998. Media has moved from a top-down model to something slightly more crowdsourced.\n\nBrown\u2019s book ends around the time she left Vanity Fair in the hands of Graydon Carter and took over The New Yorker in 1992. Its previous editor, Robert Gottlieb, who replaced the uber-literary William Shawn, had failed to interpret Newhouse\u2019s Sphinxlike wishes. The industry was still looking pretty good; Brown\u2019s New Yorker successor, David Remnick, brought the magazine into the black. Save Me the Plums, a 2019 memoir by Ruth Reichl, who edited Gourmet from 1999 to 2009, is less rosy. Called to a meeting with Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s then-editorial director James Truman at Dorothy Parker\u2019s historical hangout the Algonquin and hooked with an offer of six times her salary as The New York Times\u2019 restaurant critic, Reichl took on the job of leading the magazine out of decades of fustiness. She achieved it by making the recipes friendly for home cooks (rather than private chefs) and sending writers like David Foster Wallace to consider lobsters, simultaneously lowering the barrier to entry and elevating the discourse around food.\n\nVanity Fair\u2019s June 1985 cover, photographed by Harry Benson, marked a reversal of fortunes for the title, which had been close to shuttering. Harry Benson\n\nLeaving behind her bohemian West Coast roots and her adventurous outer-borough eating at the Times, Reichl also gets integrated into the Cond\u00e9 Nast lifestyle cult: driver, clothing allowance, enormous office, and private dining room. As Nast knew, you have to have it in order to flaunt it. \u201cI\u2019d let Si tie me up in golden strings,\u201d Reichl writes. \u201cHe kept us so thoroughly insulated from ordinary life that for ten years I never balanced a checkbook, made a reservation, or knew where I was meant to be at a given moment.\u201d (The memoirs themselves sometimes function as lifestyle porn.) Surrounded by conspicuous consumption, Reichl refers to the quadrumvirate of other powerful Cond\u00e9 magazine editors as \u201cAnnaGraydonDavidPaige.\u201d\n\nReichl, at least, seems to have sensed that this life of excess and luxury couldn\u2019t last forever. Explaining her controversial decision to put unfancy cupcakes on a cover, she writes, \u201cThroughout human history, food trends have come from the top, slowly working their way down from royal tables to the modest homes of the hoi polloi\u2026. For the first time in history, food trends began to work their way up from the street.\u201d The rise of the internet, where eventually anyone could post their food photos instead of finding them in a glossy, had something to do with this reversal. Reichl wanted to build a Gourmet web site early on, but New\u00adhouse wouldn\u2019t cede ground that was already taken up by another one of Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s properties, the digital-only Epicurious, where all the recipes from Cond\u00e9\u2019s food magazines were published. By the time he agreed, it was too late.\n\n\u201cWe survivors danced on the edge of the volcano, unwilling to admit that anything had changed,\u201d Reichl writes. The internet took up more and more space. The financial crisis cratered luxury advertising. Despite Reichl\u2019s attempts to turn the magazine and herself alike into a brand, with Gourmet TV shows and cookbooks, Newhouse decided to shut the entire publication down in 2009, after a McKinsey review. Called into the office from a far-flung stop on her book tour, Reichl thought she was just getting replaced. Instead she found \u201cthey had murdered the magazine.\u201d Along with Gourmet went Elegant Bride, Modern Bride, and the parenting magazine Cookie; Bon App\u00e9tit survived because its advertisers were more food-centric and its budget presumably smaller. The economics of aspiration stopped working.\n\nInterviewed on a recent podcast from the food web site Eater, Rei\u00adchl said that she thought the figure of the elite tastemaker-editor was gone for good. On the internet, the algorithm wins over the editor: Equations make decisions faster and take more data into account than even the most decisive and perceptive editor. The other winners are our new tastemakers, the influencers, whose job is essentially the same as the old celebrity editor\u2019s\u2014to project an image of a better, more luxurious, more stylish life and convince us to buy in\u2014but different in its form and business model. Individuals, maybe with a few assistants, post on their own accounts, which are seen as more intimate and authentic precisely because they lack the size and corporate slickness of a Cond\u00e9-style media empire.\n\nThe advertising business model that Cond\u00e9 Nast relied on to make up and exceed the gap between the subscription fees and the magazines\u2019 huge production costs no longer works. Facebook (which owns Instagram) and Google (which owns YouTube) can attract advertisers without the lure of expensive photo shoots. They don\u2019t need splashy cover stories to gather a specific audience; they already know your economic class, employment status, age, and gender from tracking your online interactions. They also make life easier for the brands, who no longer have to deal with ad departments or picky editors-in-chief; they just check the demographic boxes on the tech companies\u2019 platforms and upload their assets. It\u2019s as if beautiful flowers lost the ability to attract bees because we invented robots to put pollen on them instead.\n\nIt may be that \u201cclass publication\u201d elitism was never what mainstream audiences wanted. It was just an easy mistake to make if the only people you ever spoke to were penthouse-dwellers and Paris weekenders. Search and social media broke down the barriers between readers and content so that it became simpler for consumers to find exactly what they want. The vaunted monoculture might be over. We don\u2019t watch the same TV and movies anymore, as Tina Brown wrote\u2014unless it\u2019s Star Wars, superheroes, or Game of Thrones. Celebrity profiles are the digital-media currency of the day. Otherwise it\u2019s puppy GIFs and sunset selfies. Even if we\u2019re not influenced by influencers, we\u2019re still influenced by what our friends post, a kind of user-generated, aggregate aspiration beyond the control of any editor.\n\nCond\u00e9 Nast has ceased printing some of its minor, less enduringly iconic lifestyle titles like Self, Details, and Lucky magazines, contracting to focus on its core offerings, the magazines with name-brands strong enough to sustain revenue streams beyond print. The media companies that are thriving online right now are the ones that offer paywalled hard news and in-depth reporting, like The Washington Post and The New York Times, which has a larger newsroom than ever before.\n\nMagazine editors today tend to be quieter, tasked with survival instead of rebirth. GQ and New York magazine both recently appointed new editors-in-chief, two men who were stable veterans of their respective companies. Teen Vogue looked set to produce superstars until Phillip Picardi went to the smaller Out and Elaine Welteroth to television, where the money is better. Vanity Fair replaced Graydon Carter with Radhika Jones, the low-key former editorial director of The New York Times\u2019 books department, with a rumored quarter of Carter\u2019s salary and a mandate to cut staff.\n\nIt might be Remnick\u2019s New Yorker that is now closest to the original Cond\u00e9 Nast vision. With a fast-paced web site and a weekly radio show, it projects a new image of aspiration that has less to do with material consumption than with cultural or social cachet. Its new cohort of contributors\u2014including Jia Tolentino, Isaac Chotiner, and Helen Rosner\u2014drives conversation on the internet the way Dorothy Parker once must have whispered into Manhattan\u2019s ear at the original Vanity Fair. These writers leverage their individual online presences in tandem with their publishing perch, defining the memes, delights, and scandals of the week with articles that convert into organic marketing and profit for the title. Even as ad pages dwindle, print disappears, and social media absorbs more of our attention, the highest and most Cond\u00e9-esque goal of glossy media is likely to survive: creating a club that you want to be part of.", "description": "How a media mogul defined class and invented the modern magazine", "authors": ["Kyle Chayka"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/13716aeb53c14a664883909ab6e20582d5d93f11.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
