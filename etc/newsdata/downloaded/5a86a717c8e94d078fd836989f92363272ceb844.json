At the same time, \"you know they expect you to answer by saying something like, 'Right here, at this fabulous company!'\" Most candidates will end up giving a response about how they hope to still be with the company at that point. But the hiring manager has likely heard that dozens of times before, and won't be impressed.\n\nCNBC Contributor Suzy Welch.\n\n\"You need a 'wow' set of comments,\" Welch says, \"to add onto that reply.\" Here are two strategies for answering the question truthfully and standing out at the same time:\n\n1. Show you understand the company\n\n\"Let your comments demonstrate you have a clear-eyed view of the company's culture and the industry's growth trajectory,\" Welch says. After you express that you'd like to still be with the company five years from now, add details that show that you are aware of the organization's needs and how it operates. According to Welch, a great response would be something like this: \"In five years, I'd love to be right here, hopefully having transitioned into a strategic role. But I understand this company is very deliberate in the way it develops employees, so if my moving into strategy happens in five years or if it takes longer, I'm still incredibly excited to be a part of this organization and its mission.\" Your response will convey to the hiring manager that you're both smart and realistic.\n\n2. Explain how you want to make an impact", "description": "Don't just tell them what they're expecting to hear.", "authors": ["Marguerite Ward Kathryn Dill", "Marguerite Ward", "Kathryn Dill"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105089581-Welch_Black_Links_03272018.jpg?v=1529477845", "published_at": "2017-10-31"}
