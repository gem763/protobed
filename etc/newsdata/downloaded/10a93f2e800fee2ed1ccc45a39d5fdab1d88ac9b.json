Vance Jr. from obtaining his tax returns.\n\nThe filing comes after Mr. Vance subpoenaed the president\u2019s tax returns as his office probes potential campaign finance violations during the 2016 election related to hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, who claims to have had an affair with the president.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawsuit claims the actions of Mr. Vance, a Democrat elected in 2010, are pure politics.\n\n\u201cThe subpoena is a bad faith effort to harass the president by obtaining and exposing his confidential personal information, not a legitimate attempt to enforce New York law,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s attorneys also alleged Mr. Vance\u2019s subpoena\u2019s are \u201cunconstitutional\u201d because a sitting president cannot be subject \u201cto the criminal process.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet a county prosecutor in New York, for what appears to be the first time in our nation\u2019s history, is attempting to just that,\u201d they wrote.\n\nHowever, the president\u2019s legal team concedes that the issue of whether a sitting president can be criminally prosecuted or investigated has not been decided by the courts.\n\n\u201cIn response to the subpoenas issued by the New York County District Attorney, we have filed a lawsuit this morning in Federal Court on behalf of the President in order to address the significant constitutional issues at stake in this case,\u201d Jay Sekulow, the president\u2019s attorney, said in a statement.\n\nMr. Vance\u2019s spokesman, Danny Frost, said in response to the lawsuit: \u201cWe have received the plaintiff\u2019s complaint and will respond as appropriate in court. We will have no further comment as this process unfolds in court.\u201d\n\nAccording to Axios, this is the third time the president has filed a lawsuit seeking to block the release of his tax returns. He also has challenged House Democrats\u2019 attempts to obtain the information.\n\nMarc Mukasey, an attorney who represents the Trump Organization, said \u201cwe are in court to protect the president\u2019s rights and the Constitution.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawsuit also named his longtime accounting firm Mazars USA as a defendant in the lawsuit. Mazars earlier this week confirmed it had received a subpoena from New York prosecutors seeking years of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal and corporate tax returns.\n\nA Mazars spokeswoman said the company \u201cwill respect the legal process and fully comply with its legal obligations.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest bid by Mr. Trump to prevent prosecutors and Democrats from acquiring his tax documents. Mr. Trump bucked a decades-long tradition of presidential candidates sharing their tax returns with the public while on the campaign trail.\n\nA copy of the complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, was not immediately available. But William Consovoy, a Virginia lawyer, filed a motion seeking to represent Mr. Trump in the case.\n\nIn addition to Mazars and Mr. Vance, the lawsuit also names as a defendant Solomon Shinerock, the head of the Major Economic Crimes Bureau for the New York District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nMr. Vance is probing whether the Trump Organization falsified records related to the hush payments, which were facilitated by Mr. Trump\u2019s fixer, Michael Cohen. The payments were made ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nCohen is serving a three-year sentence at a federal prison in Otisville, New York for his role in facilitating the payments among other crimes.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
