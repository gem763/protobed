This included 83 percent of Republicans, 84 percent of Democrats, and 87 percent of independents.\n\nThe survey comes just a few months after the Democratic National Committee (DNC) faced backlash for voting down a measure to hold single-issue debates.\n\nThe DNC defended its decision and championed the idea of using forums instead.\n\nIn response to the public outcry, both CNN and MSNBC in August held standalone town halls on climate change.\n\nCNN on Thursday will host another single-issue presidential town hall that will be focused on LGBTQ issues.\n\nNine Democratic presidential candidates will make back-to-back appearances, taking questions from both the audience and CNN journalists about their plans to promote equality for the LGBTQ community.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenDemocrats request testimony from Trump's former Russia adviser Pence open to releasing transcripts of call with Ukraine Trey Gowdy joins Trump's legal team MORE, South Bend Ind.
