The Theewaterskloof Dam, at that stage, was only 22% full.\n\n\"Currently, that dam is more than three times that level at 66.5%,\" Bredell said. The City of Cape Town's dams are nearing 80% full.\n\nThis was evident in pictures posted on Villiersdorp Tourism's Facebook page, where the sight of the water delighted residents.\n\nBut it doesn't mean that it's safe to take a deep bath as residents across the province have been urged to continue using water sparingly.\n\n\"The resource will always be under pressure and we need to continue with the good practices we have seen,\" Bredell said.\n\nMeanwhile, the situation in the rural Karoo region of the Western Cape, especially in the agricultural area, remains serious.\n\nThese are the major dam statistics: Vo\u00eblvlei dam \u2013 79.6% full this week (2018: 59.8%, last week: 74.4%);\n\nBergriver Dam 100% full this week (2018: 86.5%, last week: 100%);\n\nTheewaterskloof Dam \u2013 66.5% full this week (2018: 42%, last week: 61.7%);\n\nClanwilliam Dam 91.6%. (2018: 99.2%, last week: 71.6%)\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
