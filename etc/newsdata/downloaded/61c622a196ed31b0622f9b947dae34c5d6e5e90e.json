It also stands in contrast to what central banks around the globe have been doing: cutting rates into negative integers and increasing quantitative easing operations to fend off a global economic downturn.\n\nIt's perhaps counterintuitive that the market would be expecting these higher yields to last for long in a global interest rate environment that includes nearly $17 trillion in negative-yielding debt.\n\nThe Momentum ETF used in this comparison invests large- and mid-capitalization stocks that have enjoyed big moves in valuation. It's top five holdings are Visa, Mastercard, Microsoft, Procter & Gamble and Walt Disney.\n\nThe Value ETF, buys U.S. large- and mid-capitalization stocks with relatively lower valuations. It holds AT&T, Intel, IBM, Pfizer and Bank of America in in its top five.\n\nBeyond signaling a bet on interest rates, a repositioning from momentum to value could indicate a flight to safety for investors concerned about a downturn, even as the market hovers around new highs.\n\n\"If interest rates are done falling and about to turn higher, it hurts high growth stocks with sky-high P/E ratios by diminishing the future value of earnings and raising borrowing costs,\" Pearkes said.", "description": "Investor sentiment has shifted from momentum to value stocks in a move that reveals expectations for higher bond yields.", "authors": ["Al Lewis"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106076568-1565709007441gettyimages-1074827546.jpeg?v=1565862256"}
