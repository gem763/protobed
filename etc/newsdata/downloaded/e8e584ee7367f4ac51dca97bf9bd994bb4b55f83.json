Huawei has been on a US trade blacklist since May.\n\nIt meant that anyone buying the new phones wouldn't have access to Google's Play Store or apps like Gmail, YouTube, and Google search.\n\nBut Android researcher John Wu found a workaround to installing Google apps on the phone using an app called \"LZPlay.\"\n\nHours after Wu reported his findings, LZPlay vanished, 9 to 5 Google reports.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nOne of the only easy workarounds for getting Google apps onto the new Huawei Mate 30 has disappeared, 9to5 Google reports\n\nThe Huawei Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro launched last month, notably arriving without any access to Google's Play Store or Google apps and services. That's because Huawei has been on a US trade blacklist since May, and isn't permitted to do business with Google. The upshot for anyone buying the new phones was that the devices would be running on a de-Googled version of Android.\n\nStill, users quickly found ways around the issue. In late September, 9to5Mac detailed a service called LZPlay which would let Mate 30 owners easily download and run Google services.\n\nOn Tuesday, Android researcher John Wu published an article detailing exactly how LZPlay worked. Just hours after the publication of Wu's article LZPlay's website vanished and any already-downloaded copies of their APK ceased to work, 9to5 Google reported.\n\nWu noted that the service lets users download an Android application package (APK), which in turn allowed them to install Google services on their phone.\n\nWhat was most curious, according to Wu, was that the app made use of special permissions on Huawei's phones to install system apps - permissions that he said Huawei actively must have granted.\n\nWu's conclusion was that Huawei was aware of LZPlay's existence and \"explicitly\" allowed it to remain on its App Gallery store as a \"backdoor\" for allowing people to download Google apps. \"The sole purpose of the app is to install Google Services on a non licensed device, and it sounds very sketchy to me,\" he wrote.\n\nCommenting on LZPlay's subsequent disappearance, Wu speculated that Huawei had revoked the app's permissions.\n\nHuawei was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Business Insider.", "description": "Android researcher John Wu found a backdoor to installing Google apps on the phone using an app called 'LZPlay.'", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9431/8241ad5224394174825c502b421f6891.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
