Some of it, yes\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "If you have ever wondered how it feels to have your magazine guest-edited by the world\u2019s most-watched royal, here is a rough guide. Travel to Kensington Palace alone, in secret, many months before publication. Agree a plan over mint tea. Assign said royal a code name, known only to your innermost circle, and distract the rest of your staff by having them work on a completely different issue. (This may be used later, or even written off as a loss leader; it\u2019s a price worth paying for the impact the project will have.)\n\nFor Edward Enninful, who morphed from Vogue editor to covert agent when the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, expressed an interest in guest-editing his magazine, the deception was the hardest part. \u201cEvery single day we were having secret meetings in my office,\u201d Enninful tells me, speaking on the phone a fortnight after the magazine reached newsstands. \u201cWe were just grateful for each day that went by without a leak.\u201d\n\nThere were no royal visits to Vogue House (too much of a giveaway) but Enninful and Markle kept in touch by phone, email and through meetings at Kensington Palace. \u201cWhen the magazine came out, I spoke to everybody we\u2019d kept in the dark, explaining that it wasn\u2019t personal,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I understood that the fewer people who knew, the better. For the people in the know, they couldn\u2019t even tell their partners. Having to keep it quiet like that didn\u2019t compare to anything I\u2019d done before.\u201d\n\nWhen the time came, the final proof pages of the magazine had to be transported from Vogue HQ to the printers face down. But perhaps the most challenging step in the process came afterwards \u2013 when Enninful revealed his secret to the world, and the culture war began.\n\nEnninful and Markle\u2019s collaboration, the cover of which was a grid of 15 women jointly selected as \u201cForces For Change\u201d, quickly became a proxy battle about modern, diverse Britain. Its ferocity was not something the editor saw coming. \u201cI was so engrossed in these women, and in the magazine,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWe were not trying to create an issue that was shocking \u2013 we were shining a light on incredible women, some who are not famous at all.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest British Vogue\u2019s September issue, guest-edited by Meghan Markle. Photograph: courtesy of Cond\u00e9 Nast\n\nThe September Vogue, which Markle has described as having her \u201cthumbprint\u201d all over it, reportedly sold out in just two weeks, and is currently being auctioned for more than five times its \u00a33.99 cover price on eBay. The very fact of its publication became a news story around the world, generating interest and an audience that went far beyond Vogue\u2019s usual constituency. \u201cFor a magazine like Vogue to still cause a debate, especially at a time when it\u2019s supposed to be \u2018the end of magazines\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s pretty incredible,\u201d Enninful says. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe that so many people wanted to talk about it. That\u2019s what magazines did best when we were growing up, back in the day.\u201d\n\nBut the backlash was equally loud. Markle was, according to critics, being unduly political, \u201cdivisive\u201d for celebrating transgender women, and \u201cleftwing\u201d for supporting progressive causes. One entertainment writer even professed to know the inner thoughts of the monarch, claiming: \u201cThe Queen will think this is an absolutely idiotic, ridiculous decision, as do I.\u201d\n\nAfter the dust settled, Markle\u2019s noisiest rightwing critics \u2013 Melanie Phillips and Sarah Vine among them\u2013 moved on to their next target, leaving only the trolling dregs. \u201cWas the criticism racist? Some of it, yeah,\u201d Enninful says. \u201cActually it was more than racism,\u201d he adds. \u201cI thought it was personal \u2013 attacking someone you don\u2019t know, attacking her.\u201d\n\nThe double standard at work was hard to ignore. While Enninful and Markle\u2019s collaboration prompted sneers, Prince Charles\u2019s two-time guest editorship of Country Life magazine, and stints by Prince Harry at Radio 4\u2019s Today programme and Kate Middleton at Huffington Post, had been quietly praised at the time. Many of the criticisms aimed at Markle \u2013 she was branded \u201cuppity\u201d for assuming the role, and accused of being \u201canti-white\u201d for focusing on diversity \u2013 are familiar tropes aimed at people of colour who enter white spaces and fail to seek white approval, or who celebrate their heritage and diversity.\n\nAt 13 I arrive, with big glasses and afro. I don\u2019t know anything about England. At 16 I\u2019m modelling. At 18 I\u2019m editing\n\nEnninful says that Markle\u2019s first email to him proposing a collaboration \u2013 which he describes as being signed somewhat cryptically with a single \u201cM\u201d \u2013 suggested that they would have \u201clots in common\u201d. And it\u2019s true that, besides their shared love of fashion, literature and photography, both have experienced controversy simply for daring to occupy the space they are in. While Markle\u2019s entry to the royal family prompted endless comment \u2013 much of it openly hostile \u2013 about her biracial heritage, self-made career and feminist values, Enninful\u2019s appointment was also regarded as provocative: the first Vogue editor in the magazine\u2019s 103-year history to represent a departure from white, female privilege. This 47-year-old, gay, state-school-educated Ghanaian immigrant is, it\u2019s fair to say, a serial offender when it comes to the crime of editing while being black.\n\n***\n\nEnninful and I sit down for the first time six weeks before publication of the Markle issue, in his bright and uncluttered office, high up in Vogue House. Although the pages I\u2019m about to see being finalised are the product of the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s editorship, I don\u2019t know that yet; the cover and letter she has written to readers have been quietly left aside. Instead, at Enninful\u2019s desk, his own life story is laid out before me in pictures, as told through a sample of old i-D magazines, spanning a period of 20 years.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest As a model, in Wolfgang Tillmans\u2019 portrait \u2018Edward\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is where it all started for me,\u201d Enninful says, as we examine photographs of his first modelling shoot in 1988: a sultry-looking teenager rocks a grungy camel hat and coat, shirt nonchalantly tied around his waist. It\u2019s an intriguing glimpse into the earliest phase of Enninful\u2019s fashion career, just days after he was spotted by Simon Foxton, a stylist for i-D magazine. At 16, Enninful oozes all the edgy cool and quirk of a London teen, despite having arrived in the UK only a few years earlier. His father, CK Enninful, a major in the Ghanaian military, had moved with his wife and six children to London in 1985, and his mother, Grace, a seamstress, was on her way to becoming a fashion force herself.\n\n\u201cWhen we lived in Ghana, my mother had been busy making clothes for everyone in high society,\u201d Enninful tells me, proudly. \u201cBut once we got to London it went to another level. I was her favourite \u2013 a sensitive creature, the gay one. We were always sketching together, and I learned how to construct clothes.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an origin story that is an irresistible departure from that of the stereotypical British Vogue editor: a larger-than-life seamstress whirring away at a seemingly endless production of figure-hugging outfits in bright lace, cotton and wax prints with her youngest son at her side, immersed in a world of hooks and eyelets, peplums and sleeves. Enninful\u2019s mother, he says, gave him his love and instinct for style. \u201cI learned my sense of colours from her. I learned to build characters. We would ask: \u2018What kind of woman wears this dress?\u2019\u201d he explains. \u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s made me a bit different from other stylists. I have to know the woman, put her in a location, know her character, her inner life. If I don\u2019t have a character, I can\u2019t style.\u201d\n\nAfter being spotted by Foxton and shooting his first commercial, Enninful rose quickly through the ranks of i-D magazine, becoming Foxton\u2019s assistant and then, remarkably, fashion director at just 18. Founded in 1980 by former British Vogue art director Terry Jones and his wife Tricia, i-D had by then established itself as the home of alternative style, nurturing new talent and treating street culture as serious fashion. Enninful had stumbled into the perfect home.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest i-D cover 150, styled by Enninful. Photographer: Juergen Teller. Hair and makeup: Cathy Lomax.

Model: Gisele\n\n\u201cAt 13, I arrive from Ghana. I don\u2019t really know anything about England,\u201d Enninful says. \u201cAt 16, I\u2019m modelling. At 18, I\u2019m editing!\u201d The Vogue editor is still surprised at the unlikeliness and speed of his ascent.\n\nEnninful\u2019s family had left Ghana in a hurry. His father\u2019s military service, including peacekeeping missions to Egypt and Liberia, meant that Enninful and his siblings grew up on an army barracks at Cape Coast, Ghana\u2019s one-time colonial capital. It was a \u201csheltered\u201d life, as Enninful describes it, until it wasn\u2019t. By the late 70s, General Ignatius Kutu Acheampong \u2013 a military dictator who had seized power in a coup \u2013 lost power in a second, and was executed in a third.\n\nThe instigator of what is now remembered as one of the country\u2019s most unstable periods was a charismatic Ghanaian pilot named Flight Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings, who assumed the leadership in 1981. \u201cI remember when Rawlings came in; I remember the shouting!\u201d Enninful recalls. \u201cI remember that some people loved him \u2013 to them, he was like the saviour of the world. But not to my father. He wasn\u2019t going to work for Rawlings.\u201d Such was the enmity between Enninful Sr and the new president that the family left the country.\n\nI took the OBE for Dad. He cried, apparently. I had a party afterwards, and he was dancing with Madonna\n\n\u201cIt was all a blur,\u201d Enninful says. \u201cI\u2019m sure it was a disaster for me, leaving my friends, and I had my big glasses and my afro. I didn\u2019t even realise we were leaving Ghana for good. One minute we were in Vauxhall staying with an aunt, the next we were whipped off to Ladbroke Grove\u2026\u201d\n\nWhen Enninful led a trip of notable Ghanaians back to the country of his birth in 1991, alongside Naomi Campbell and designer Ozwald Boateng, his father forbade him from meeting President Rawlings. \u201cMy dad was very clear: you cannot meet that man,\u201d he says. And on that occasion, he obeyed his father. At other times, there was conflict \u2013 especially when, aged 18, Enninful quit his degree course at Goldsmiths, University of London, to work full time at i-D. \u201cMy dad was a disciplinarian, a traditional Ghanaian and a military man,\u201d Enninful explains. \u201cMy mother knew that I was this gay, creative child, and she gave me her blessings. But my father kicked me out. I had found fashion, but I had to grow up quickly.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Receiving his OBE in October 2016 with partner Alec Maxwell and his mother; sister Akua; his father; and Naomi Campbell. Photograph: PA\n\nReconciliation with his father came gradually, Enninful says, culminating in his decision in 2016 to accept an honour. \u201cI took the OBE for Dad,\u201d he says. \u201cHe cried, apparently, and I was glad to give him that. I had a party afterwards, and he was dancing with Madonna. The man who once kicked me out became so proud.\u201d\n\n***\n\nLater that day, I sit in on an editorial meeting with Enninful\u2019s team, reviewing the final stages of the forthcoming issue. He has been keen to explode any preconceptions of a work environment straight out of The Devil Wears Prada, the film in which the staff of a magazine closely modelled on American Vogue are depicted as stressed-out, neurotic and harassed, while at all times dressed to kill. \u201cWe do have a lot of work to do, it is stressful,\u201d Enninful says. \u201cBut the way I work best is to be surrounded with people who are quite joyful, and to keep everything light.\u201d\n\nWe begin in the newsroom, reviewing the website\u2019s performance for the day so far. It is hard to concentrate at first because \u2013 I\u2019m afraid to say \u2013 the staff are distractingly well-dressed. The digital director is wearing a hot pink catsuit, and the fashion director an elegant ensemble of black summer pleats. Enninful is clearly in charge, standing at the helm of the open-plan workspace as staff offer contributions from their desks on the floor, his tone businesslike and expectant.\n\nThe meeting races through the day\u2019s stories: Zendaya has revealed her new Spiderman suit, Heidi Klum has joined Naomi Campbell on a Project Runway spin-off, Emma Corrin (who plays Princess Diana in the fourth season of The Crown) is writing an exclusive Glastonbury festival diary for the Vogue website and Kendall Jenner has offered an online Q&A.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I like to roll my sleeves up and style a lot of the covers.\u2019 Photograph: Sebastian Nevols/The Guardian\n\nIn more traditional royal fashion news, Kate Middleton\u2019s reworking of a pair of Princess Diana\u2019s earrings has been a huge success. I nearly choke on my cup of tea when I hear the words, \u201cLet\u2019s re-social all of our other classic royal jewellery stories, and think about how we can lean into the jewellery community on this,\u201d wondering if the meeting has veered into parody. But royal jewellery stories, it turns out, are very serious business; this is Vogue, after all. But it\u2019s a relief to discover Enninful\u2019s team are not above sending themselves up. As we turn to the print edition, an editor says, \u201cOK, yes, we have done a feature on breathing. It\u2019s very now. It\u2019s a must!\u201d I\u2019m not the only one laughing.\n\nThere is also a lively debate about what Love Island tells us about racism, conducted with an ease that I can\u2019t help but link to the diversity in the room. And with each story, Enninful wants to know how it is performing, and why, and what\u2019s next. He is an old hand at this, and the collection of i-D magazines back in his office has aged well. In 1995 he styled a \u201cfuture of fashion\u201d edition featuring a dark-skinned black model, her luminescent eyes made up by Pat McGrath, a member of Enninful\u2019s original 80s squad of friends who, alongside Kate Moss, Campbell and Steve McQueen, went on to superstardom. There are Birkenstocks, the return of bumbags (the last time around), patterned knitwear and velvet, all of which would look right at home this decade, if not this season.\n\nThey said black girls don\u2019t sell magazines, so I put Rihanna on the cover\n\nI tell Enninful I once met a former i-D journalist, who worked at the magazine in the early 00s and whose job it was to get hold of Enninful. She described him as a whirlwind of activity, who had \u201cabout 10 different phones and was still almost impossible to reach\u201d. He laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s true! At that stage, I was always working. I found out I love to be nonstop.\u201d\n\nBeing i-D fashion editor was a big beat; Enninful did everything from styling the shoots to writing articles, sourcing clothes for shopping pages and dealing with advertisers. \u201cI was fearless,\u201d he says of his younger self. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any role models, anyone to show me how it was done, so I had to be. I had a duty to reflect the world I saw around me, growing up in Ladbroke Grove. People said it was edgy, but for me it was normal \u2013 it was literally what I saw.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With models Yara Shahidi (on left) and Adut Akech at New York fashion week earlier this month. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock\n\nHe was not afraid to criticise his own industry. On being missed off the guestlist for a John Galliano show in 1995, he wrote: \u201cWho knows: maybe next year the people who have supported Galliano since leaving college will be privileged to join the ranks of those allowed to see his collection. Still, that\u2019s fashion. Plus \u00e7a change\u2026\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s reminiscent of a tweet Enninful posted decades later, in 2013. By then fashion director at W magazine, he wrote from a New York fashion show: \u201cIf all my (white) counterparts are seated in the front row, why should I be expected to take 2nd row? racism? xoxo.\u201d His pointed comment was widely shared, but Enninful won\u2019t discuss this specific incident now. \u201cI never let racism question my confidence. I don\u2019t shy away from it. But I always let my work speak for itself.\u201d\n\nOne of Enninful\u2019s last acts as creative director of W, in February 2017, was a YouTube video, I Am An Immigrant, inspired by his anger at Trump\u2019s travel ban. At British Vogue, he has published the first cover of a model wearing a hijab \u2013 the diminutive and dazzling Halima Aden.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Adwoa Aboah on Enninful\u2019s first issue, December 2017\u2026\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2026and Rihanna, September 2018. Photographs: courtesy of Cond\u00e9 Nast\n\nBut despite working at the top of the fashion world for three decades, his appointment as Vogue editor in April 2017 was met with scepticism. There was the barely veiled attack on editors who are \u201cless magazine journalists and more celebrities or fashion personalities with substantial social media followings\u201d from departing editor Alexandra Shulman, and the frequent assertion that Enninful was some kind of fashion \u201coutsider\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat really made me laugh \u2013 how am I a fashion outsider?\u201d Enninful cries. \u201cI have been in fashion since I was 16. The suggestion that I was unknown, or, \u2018How can he edit a magazine when he\u2019s just a stylist?\u2019 Anna Wintour was a stylist! Franca Sozzani was a stylist! Diana Vreeland was a stylist. I am under more scrutiny than other people,\u201d Enninful admits. \u201cBut that\u2019s nothing new.\u201d\n\nThe magazine remains a platform for unattainable affluence and luxury, and some have criticised a particularly celebrity-heavy approach under Enninful, making its world appear even further out of reach. But he sees his work with celebrities, most of whom he styles himself (\u201cI like to roll my sleeves up [and] style a lot of the covers\u201d) as a form of subversion.\n\n\u201cDiversity doesn\u2019t mean downmarket \u2013 high fashion can be applied to all races, sizes, religions,\u201d Enninful explains. \u201cThey said black girls don\u2019t sell magazines, so I put Rihanna on the cover, and I styled her myself. And they told me two things you can\u2019t do is have a black-and-white cover, and a cover model who is not looking at you. So I did a cover with Madonna that was both,\u201d he says of his June 2019 edition, sold on a monochrome shot in which the pop superstar gazes away from the viewer over the side of a bathtub.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s aspirational \u2013 just look at Oprah!\u201d he declares, referencing the August 2018 cover. \u201cShe was dripping with diamonds. You couldn\u2019t think of a more high-fashion image. That\u2019s Vogue! But my work always involves documenting what\u2019s around me, and to keep normalising the marginalised. Every month I can put my hand on my heart and say it\u2019s all there: the black woman, the curvy woman, the Asian woman. We don\u2019t even think about it. It really bothered me that Vogue was seen as a magazine that is only for a certain type of woman,\u201d he adds. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t it be for everyone? Why shouldn\u2019t a woman who is black, or Muslim, or gay, or a refugee, or plus-size, see themselves reflected in what we do? Our job is simple: to keep moving the needle.\u201d\n\n***\n\nIf Enninful\u2019s passion for styling came from his beloved seamstress mother, I can\u2019t help but wonder how much of his lifestyle is inherited from his military father. His daily routine, he tells me, involves waking up at 5.30am to meditate, then working out at BXR \u2013 the state-of-the-art gym founded by boxer Anthony Joshua \u2013 where he likes to use the gruelling VersaClimber machine. He eats, he says, \u201cvery, very well. I love jollof rice,\u201d he continues, speaking wistfully of the traditional West African dish, \u201cand Jamaican rice and peas. But I gain weight easily, and these days I don\u2019t eat it too often.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With Kate Moss, one of Enninful\u2019s original 80s squad of friends who went on to superstardom. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock\n\nHe still lives in west London, with his partner Alec Maxwell, a film-maker to whom he has been engaged for 14 years, and their dog Ru, a black-and-white Boston terrier, whose Instagram account (14,600 followers) shows him sandwiched between Claudia Schiffer and Donatella Versace. But Enninful says he makes plenty of time for work, fortified by his early-morning regime, a healthy diet and a disciplined attitude towards parties \u2013 \u201cI dip in and out.\u201d\n\nThere is, after all, a lot of work to do. The market for women\u2019s magazines is tough, with some Vogue rivals \u2013 such as Cosmopolitan, whose circulation dropped by a third between January and June this year \u2013 clearly struggling. This month, it was announced that the British edition of Marie Claire would cease print publication after 31 years, while Vogue\u2019s parent company, Cond\u00e9 Nast, stopped Glamour\u2019s monthly print edition in 2018. Last year, however, Cond\u00e9 Nast turned 2017\u2019s \u00a314m pre-tax loss into a profit; sales of Vogue have remained stable at 192,212, while its digital revenues have risen by 40%, year-on-year. The magazine is still selling more copies than its rivals \u2013 more than double the circulations of Vanity Fair and Tatler.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of American Vogue. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock\n\nMeanwhile, it is the editions with a strong Enninful stamp that seem to have fared best on the newsstand; last year\u2019s September issue featuring Rihanna, and his Ariana Grande cover last July came close to selling out; the Markle Forces For Change edition overtook the previous September issue after just 12 days on sale. Perhaps this is an endorsement of Enninful\u2019s approach, which is unapologetically crowd-pleasing. \u201cFor the covers, we just figure out who represents the zeitgeist \u2013 women we love who are making some kind of a statement, and women who are having an impact on culture,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat links the cover images is a sense of classicism, modernity, and a certain throwback aspect.\u201d\n\nAnd he seems to love a good throwback. In his office, there is one more magazine he wants to show me: a 2017 edition of the men\u2019s style magazine Arena Homme. The photographer Juergen Teller shot Enninful for it sitting on an ornate chair before a marble table, manoeuvring a piece on a chessboard. \u201cCan you see what he did? The black versus the white \u2013 his pictures are so loaded,\u201d Enninful says, admiringly.\n\nFor him, however, the most powerful image in the shoot shows him standing in front of a Burger King. Despite his long career, Enninful still revels in the improbability of this state-school-educated, gay, black immigrant ending up as the editor of British Vogue. \u201cThis is where I could have ended up,\u201d Enninful says, pointing at the fast food restaurant. \u201cThat could have been the alternative.\u201d It\u2019s an image he cherishes \u2013 not because of where he is, but because of how far he has come.\n\n\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).", "description": "The editor on his collaboration with Markle, the culture war that followed \u2013 and proving his critics wrong", "authors": ["Afua Hirsch"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d63242264fa2742674c6d86aaeb5841b1eb7312/0_588_10992_6598/master/10992.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6ee2779a0278355be46e611e417cb760", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
