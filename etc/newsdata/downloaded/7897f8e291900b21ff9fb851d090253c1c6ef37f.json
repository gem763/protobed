After all, her name is not on the cover.\n\nThe American journalist has written some of the most compelling profiles in the last decade as a staff writer for the New Yorker, and she specialises in writing about interesting women. She has profiled Edith Windsor, the plaintiff who won a landmark case in the fight for gay marriage in the US; Diana Nyad, who, at the age of 64, was the first person in the world to swim from Cuba to Florida; and Julia Louis-Dreyfus of Veep and Seinfeld fame.\n\n\u201cI have always been interested in the question of \u2018what does it means to be a woman\u2019?\u201d says Levy. \u201cThe thing I\u2019m always looking for is the counterintuitive.\u201d\n\nDemi Moore reveals she was raped aged 15 Read more\n\nNow she has teamed up with Hollywood superstar Demi Moore, ghostwriting her memoir, Inside Out. The book, released earlier this month, has surprised readers with its candid revelations about Moore\u2019s career, relationships and her chaotic childhood.\n\nLevy recognises how incongruous this partnership seems. Speaking to the Guardian from the US ahead of her upcoming visit to Australia for the Broadside festival, she laughs when asked about her relationship with Moore. \u201cIf you had told me five years ago I would be good friends with Demi Moore, that she would be someone I could really properly talk to, I wouldn\u2019t have believed you. The most surprising thing was that we could relate at all.\u201d\n\nLevy\u2019s involvement in the book began after Moore\u2019s publisher read Levy\u2019s own 2017 memoir, The Rules Do Not Apply, and thought the two shared some overlapping experiences \u2013 including the experience of miscarriage. \u201cHer editor read my memoir and had a feeling that we would get each other, and we met and we did,\u201d says Levy.\n\nI have become a better person \u2013 better at being alive \u2013 since I\u2019ve had my arse kicked Ariel Levy\n\nMoore was also grateful for the help of a professional writer, telling the Wall Street Journal: \u201cI wanted it to be a good book, but I didn\u2019t feel like my skill set lent itself to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nThe process involved many conversations with Moore at the actor\u2019s homes in California and Idaho, and then turning the transcripts into a book written in her voice.\n\n\u201cI spent a lot of time with [Moore], so I got a feel for how she communicates. The book does sound like her, not like me. I did that by using her words. A lot of what\u2019s in there is direct quotes. It\u2019s her language and it\u2019s her story. I was a midwife.\u201d\n\nThe construction of the book is not dissimilar to Levy\u2019s, beginning with a dramatic moment before rewinding and telling the story of how Moore got there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty raw,\u201d says Levy. \u201cShe really went for it. She didn\u2019t take anything out. I think she really wanted to communicate. She was sick of people trying to tell her who she should be.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Journalist Ariel Levy: \u2018I was sick of myself.\u2019 Photograph: Annabel Clark/The Guardian\n\nAfter writing The Rules Do Not Apply and talking about her own life for months on end while on an international tour, Levy was keen to have a break from her own story. \u201cI was sick of myself,\u201d she says.\n\nLevy\u2019s own memoir is a harrowing read. In it she describes how she lost her marriage, house and baby in quick succession, and how it felt, at mid-life, to not have the life you want. It could be described as a second coming-of-age memoir \u2013 about how the real work of adulthood begins with loss.\n\n\u201cThere are very few people that I\u2019ve met who have not had a trial by fire,\u201d says Levy. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it makes them a better person, but I have become a better person \u2013 better at being alive \u2013 since I\u2019ve had my arse kicked.\u201d\n\nNow, \u201ceveryone tells me about their miscarriages. It\u2019s a privilege when people tell me about this really personal, animal, primal experience of being a woman. I like that people tell me about that stuff. It\u2019s a deep way to connect.\u201d\n\nLevy has also made her first foray into podcasting, hosting Broken: Jeffrey Epstein, a detailed exploration of the sex-trafficking scandal that has implicated so many rich and powerful people.\n\nA bold new podcast takes on the Epstein scandal \u2013 podcasts of the week Read more\n\n\u201cTo me what\u2019s interesting is the web of humanity involved \u2013 all these lives intersect. You had Trump, Clinton, Prince Andrew and then all these girls that work at McDonald\u2019s and live at West Palm Beach, which is a really hard place. Girls from a certain type of background, girls who were poor, [Epstein] just walked on,\u201d she says.\n\nLevy is skilled at seeing patterns of patriarchy and sexism that lie under the surface of everyday life. Her 2005 book, Female Chauvinist Pigs, explored how early 2000s raunch culture sold sexual objectification back to women as female empowerment, often resulting in women objectifying themselves.\n\nShe believes that things have changed since then \u2013 but not for the better. \u201cI think it\u2019s a more dire time now.\u201d\n\nHer own life, though, is finally back on a more even keel. She is married to the South African doctor she met in Mongolia, who treated her when she had a miscarriage while on assignment for the New Yorker. The pair live most of the year in New York state on Shelter Island and South Africa \u201cfor a couple of months of the year\u201d, where Levy\u2019s stepsons attend university.\n\n\u201cThis is a really nice time in my life right now.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Ariel Levy will be a guest at Broadside festival, held in Melbourne on 9 and 10 November", "description": "From hosting a podcast about Jeffrey Epstein to ghostwriting for one of Hollywood\u2019s most famous, the journalist reflects on life after her \u2018trial by fire\u2019", "authors": ["Brigid Delaney"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19a9d366510a98fd2673e4945e143610aa334d52/0_1339_3538_2123/master/3538.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bfb02efa61e8419b2750c20bfb34c872", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
