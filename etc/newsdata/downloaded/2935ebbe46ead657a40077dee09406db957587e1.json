Wade, the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark 1973 ruling that established a right to an abortion.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI think this is a really unique moment for us as an organization,\u201d said Kelley Robinson, executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes. \u201cThe stakes are higher than ever, and we\u2019re coming out more powerful than ever with our largest investment ever made.\u201d\n\nThe financial commitment is a substantial increase from the $30 million Planned Parenthood committed to spending in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBut the past year has raised questions about whether Planned Parenthood can enter 2020 with the same firepower it brought to the 2018 midterms, when it helped elect what Democrats describe as the first ever \u201cpro-choice\u201d majority in the House.\n\nIn 2019 alone, Planned Parenthood\u2019s board of directors fired its president and engaged in a public dispute over the terms of her departure; its health centers lost millions of dollars in federal family planning funding under a new rule issued by the Trump administration; and it fought to keep open the last remaining abortion clinic in Missouri \u2014 a Planned Parenthood affiliate.\n\nMeanwhile, the organization was trying to beat back a surge of state abortion bans, as 12 states in the first half of the year enacted some kind of ban on the procedure.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOverall, it\u2019s been a challenging year for Planned Parenthood, an organization that has long played the dual role of a reproductive rights advocate and health care provider, making it more susceptible to political attacks by conservatives but highly influential among Democrats.\n\nOne former Planned Parenthood staffer said it seems as though the organization is constantly in \u201cself-preservation\u201d mode, fighting existential battles.\n\n\u201cWhen you focus on self-preservation, you play the game differently \u2014 more safe, not as aggressively,\u201d the former staffer said, but predicted that next year will be different.\n\n\u201cThere is no group that is more fired up for 2020 than women. I suspect that they're able to right the ship.\"\n\nBy Election Day, Planned Parenthood plans to reach 5 million voters, specifically those who they say are most harmed by Trump\u2019s policies: women, people of color and LGBT people.\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019re going to have a critical role mobilizing those folks to win back the Senate and expand the path to 270 to win back the presidency,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s $45 million campaign, which includes canvassing, mailings, television, radio and digital ads, will initially focus on battleground states the group considers key to winning the White House and flipping the Senate: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThe ads will begin airing later this year, with broader investments expected down the line.\n\nRobinson said Planned Parenthood has 13 million supporters and has spent the past two years building 600 volunteer-led organizing teams across the country.\n\nBut the organization's challenges this year have energized anti-abortion activists, who argue Planned Parenthood is becoming more extreme.\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood is absolutely on the defense,\u201d said Mallory Quigley, vice president of communications for the Susan B. Anthony List, a D.C.-based organization that seeks to elect candidates who oppose abortion.\n\n\u201cAll of the decisions that have been made at the highest levels this year have underlined their commitment to abortion in the most extreme cases and circumstances.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s health centers in August forfeited millions of dollars in federal family planning funds, which pay for birth control and other services for low-income patients, after the Trump administration banned Title X grantees from referring women for abortions. The loss of funding means some Planned Parenthood patients might have to pay more for care that was once subsidized by the government.\n\nPlanned Parenthood, which joined several states and organizations in suing over the rules, calls those changes a \u201cgag rule\u201d that interferes in the doctor-patient relationship, stopping providers from telling women where they can get abortions. Title X funds don\u2019t cover abortions.\n\nAnti-abortion activists argue Planned Parenthood\u2019s decision to leave the program rather than comply with the new rules is proof it cares more about abortion than other health services.\n\nEarlier this year, many of those activists seized on the unexpected firing of Dr. Leana Wen, the first medical doctor to lead Planned Parenthood in 50 years.\n\nWen, who held the job for only nine months, said she and the board of directors had \u201cphilosophical\u201d disagreements: She wanted to depoliticize abortion while the board saw political activism as the best way to fight increasing attacks on abortion coming from state lawmakers and the Trump administration.\n\nPlanned Parenthood staffers vehemently pushed back on Wen\u2019s account, arguing her dismissal stemmed from poor leadership skills.\n\nBut Wen\u2019s comments gave new momentum to anti-abortion groups that plan to go to head-to-head with the organization in 2020, painting it as an extremist organization that only cares about abortion.\n\nStill, polls show that most Americans support the battles Planned Parenthood has been fighting.\n\nIn a Kaiser Family Foundation Poll conducted in April, 56 percent of respondents said they oppose restricting family planning funds for groups that provide abortion referrals, and 69 percent said Planned Parenthood should continue to receive Medicaid funds.\n\n\u201cThey have a really, really strong brand and a lot of people have no idea there has been any of these kinds of issues or changes,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a leading Democratic strategist who has worked with Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cEven in conservative states, people have very positive views of them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re unique in their linkage to advocacy and service delivery, and people think it\u2019s very appropriate they would be an advocate, with the services they provide.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s message will also be strengthened by the 12 states that have passed bans or restrictions on abortion this year in an effort to get the Supreme Court to revisit Roe v. Wade, Lake said.\n\nSome of those bans, which have been blocked in the courts, do not include exemptions for rape or incest, despite 86 percent of Americans supporting those exemptions, according to an NPR/Marist poll.\n\n\u201cVery, very high numbers of voters are aware of the bans. That has not dissipated,\u201d Lake said. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that with a public that forgets things so fast, women in particular have not forgotten about the bans.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood has already scored a handful of victories heading into 2020, illustrating the influence it still wields in the Democratic Party.\n\nIn June, the group held its first ever presidential candidate forum, with nearly every Democratic White House hopeful participating and taking questions from Planned Parenthood staffers.\n\nAdditionally, all of the Democrats running for president have said they want to repeal the Hyde amendment, a long-standing ban on federal funding for abortions that Planned Parenthood argues is discriminatory to low-income people, particularly women of color.\n\nWhen former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenDemocrats request testimony from Trump's former Russia adviser Pence open to releasing transcripts of call with Ukraine Trey Gowdy joins Trump's legal team MORE, the front-runner for the party\u2019s nomination, reaffirmed his decades-long support for the ban in June, he faced swift blowback from abortion-rights groups, including Planned Parenthood.\n\nBiden later reversed his stance, saying he now opposes the Hyde amendment.\n\nRobinson said changes like those are part of the group\u2019s goals for 2020.\n\nWe are \u201cholding every candidate to the highest standard\u201d and \u201cdemanding more from every elected official,\u201d she said.\n\nRead more from The Hill:\n\nPlanned Parenthood issues first wave of 2020 House, Senate endorsements", "description": "Planned Parenthood is charging into the 2020 elections after a challenging year that saw a slew of state-passed abortion bans and the loss of its president and millions of dollars in federal funding.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/plannedparenthood_072617upi_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
