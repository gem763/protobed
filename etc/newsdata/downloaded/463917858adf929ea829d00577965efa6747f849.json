Somhow, Maggiolo said, the device activated, and produced a \u201clarge quantity of smoke.\u201d\n\nIt was enough, he said, to prompt a call to the fire department. On arrival, firefighters found smoke at the front door, and a considerable amount inside. The smoke was quickly determined to be nonhazardous, Maggiolo said. Firefighters shut it off and ventilated the building.\n\nThere was no fire and no injury, the fire department said.\n\nSmoke machines are generally described as devices that emit dense clouds of vapor that resemble fog or smoke. Often they are known as fog generators or fog machines, and they may be familiar to patrons of concerts, nightclubs and theatrical productions.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why the machine was in the building or what activated it.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Smoke on Seventh Street prompts fears of fire, fire department says.", "authors": ["Martin Weil", "Local Reporter", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
