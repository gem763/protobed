They pleaded not guilty.\n\nThey are currently free on bail and claim Natalia is actually an adult woman pretending to be a child. Doctors have been unable to conclusively determine her age.\n\nAfter living on her own for several years, Natalie Grace is now in the custody of Antwon and Cynthia Mans, who tells Insider she\u2019s \u201creally just fine.\u201d\n\nBetween her two guardianships, Natalia attended local adult education classes and hung out at a drug and alcohol recovery house while living on her own.\n\nAnother Indiana parent who adopted a child from Ukraine told Insider that the country\u2019s adoption system is corrupt and has a history of falsifying birth certificates.\n\nVisit Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nLAFAYETTE, Indiana \u2013 Depending on whom you believe, Natalia Grace \u2013 a Ukrainian-born orphan with a rare form of dwarfism \u2013 is either a sweet 15-year-old or a 30-year-old con artist.\n\nNatalia\u2019s story has gone viral. And while it may seem like the plot of a horror movie, it\u2019s a real-life drama tearing apart two Indiana families.\n\nAntwon Mans, one half of the couple currently caring for Natalia, told Insider his family is living a quiet life in a new town. For the most part, they\u2019ve remained unaware of the media coverage she\u2019s received.\n\n\u201cGod is protecting us. He is fighting our battles for us, and we are really just fine,\u201d Mans said.\n\nBut things aren\u2019t so fine for Natalia\u2019s previous adoptive parents.\n\nA child, or an adult posing as a child?\n\nIn September, Kristine Barnett, 46, and her ex-husband Michael Barnett, 43, were charged with neglect of a dependent, to which they pleaded not guilty. When the two moved to Canada in 2013 with their other children, they left Natalia on her own. She took local adult education classes and socialized in a halfway house until the Mans family took her in three years later.\n\nDuring the Barnetts\u2019 first court appearance, Michael Barnett\u2019s attorney, Terrance Kinnard, suggested the Barnetts were caught in ruse when they gained custody of Natalia in a 2010 emergency adoption. While they were led to believe Natalia was six years old, she was really a troubled adult posing as a child, Kinnard said.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Kristine agreed with her ex-husband\u2019s attorney and blamed the state of Indiana for their troubles.\n\n\u201cI am praying for Natalia, who I believe is ill, and am dismayed by the way our mental health system treats people,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe state of Indiana actually discharged Natalia into a half-way house over a year before this, making her homeless and mentally ill.\u201d\n\n\u2018She had periods. She had adult teeth.\u2019\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Mail, Kristine claimed that shortly after adopting Natalia \u2013 who was born with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita \u2013 she noticed things that made her question her daughter\u2019s age.\n\n\u201cNatalia was a woman. She had periods. She had adult teeth. She never grew a single inch, which would happen even with a child with dwarfism,\u201d she said. \u201cThe doctors all confirmed she was suffering a severe psychological illness only diagnosed in adults.\u201d\n\nKristine claimed that, once confronted, Natalia rapidly became out of control. She smeared bodily fluids on the walls, poured bleach into Kristine\u2019s coffee, drew violent pictures of her new family, and attempted to push Kristine into an electric fence, Kristine said.\n\nRead more: Parents who adopted a 6-year-old girl now say she was actually in her 20s. A rare form of dwarfism may have contributed to the confusion.\n\nAccording to court documents reviewed by Insider, Natalia was hospitalized multiple times in 2011 and 2012 at St. Vincent Stress Center in Indianapolis, and later at a state-run facility. Psychiatric testing revealed that she had mental illnesses consistent with patients in their late teens or twenties, the court records say.\n\nIn June of 2012, according to court records, a Marion County Superior Court in Indianapolis changed Natalia\u2019s birth year from 2003 back to 1989 \u2013 legally altering her age from 8 to 22 years old.\n\ncaption Kristine Barnett in 2013. source Donna Svennevik/Disney-Walt Disney Television via Getty Images\n\nFollowing the change, the Barnetts tried to set her up for life as an independent adult \u2013 twice. They initially placed her in a state-run home through a program called Aspire Indiana, but she was evicted, the Barnetts told the Daily Mail. They then rented her an apartment in Lafayette, Indiana. Kristine said she paid Natalia\u2019s rent for a year, and set her up with Social Security, disability aid, food stamps, and Medicaid.\n\nA month later, the Barnetts moved to Canada to help their son Jacob \u2013 a child prodigy and the subject of Kristina\u2019s book, \u201cThe Spark: A Mother\u2019s Story of Nurturing, Genius, and Autism\u201d \u2013 attend the prestigious Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario. Natalia stayed behind in Indiana.\n\nNatalia attended adult education classes despite claiming to be a child\n\nWhile living on her own, Natalia enrolled in school at the Lafayette Adult Resource Academy (LARA) to work on her GED. That\u2019s where her next-door neighbor, Margaret Axsom met her.\n\n\u201cShe loved to talk. She could be shy at first, but once she got going, she had something to say about everything,\u201d Axsom told Insider.\n\nWhile Axsom said she didn\u2019t believe it was right for a family to leave the country with a young woman recently out on her own, she also doesn\u2019t think Natalia was a child.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how old she was, but she had to be at least 18,\u201d she said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t seem worldly enough to be 30 now. I think it must be something in between.\u201d\n\ncaption The Lafayette Adult Resource Academy. source Google Maps\n\nThe two not only attended classes together but socialized in the neighborhood, often meeting up with people from a drug and alcohol recovery house at the end of the block.\n\n\u201cI never worried about her going over there because I was always with her,\u201d Axsom said. \u201c[The residents] had to take an alcohol test every night, stay clean, and sign in and out. Natalia was lonely and just wanted people to talk to.\u201d\n\nIn September 2013, things changed. Natalia disappeared.\n\n\u201cShe just up and vanished,\u201d Axsom said. \u201cThey asked at school, and I said I didn\u2019t know where she went.\u201d\n\nThat night, Axsom learned that Natalia had been evicted from her apartment. A few days before Natalia vanished, Police had stopped by to interview Axsom about her, she said.\n\n\u201cThey kept telling me they just wanted to put her somewhere safe,\u201d Axsom said.\n\nNatalia couldn\u2019t take those classes unless she was an adult\n\nLARA doesn\u2019t allow just anyone to take classes. To attend, students need to take a placement test to determine their knowledge of math, English, history, and science. If they don\u2019t demonstrate a junior high level of knowledge, they are asked to work with a tutor to get up to grade level before being permitted to enroll.\n\n\u201cThis is adult ed. We cannot have anyone under the age of 16,\u201d LARA teacher Meg Foley told Insider. \u201cAnyone under 18 must be enrolled by a parent and have written release from the school they came from.\u201d\n\ncaption Antwon and Cynthia Mans (left) and Natalia Grace. source Facebook\n\nFor several years, Natalia\u2019s whereabouts were unknown.\n\nThen, in April 2016, a new couple entered the story: Antwon and Cynthia Mans. The two asked Tippecanoe County\u2019s family court if they could take over as her guardian.\n\nRead more: The Ukrainian orphan accused of being an adult was found living with another family in Indiana\n\nNatalia, it turned out, was still living in the same city where she\u2019d last been seen. In fact, she was living just a block away from LARA.\n\nMichael Barnett, by then separated from Kristine, attended the Marion County Court hearing with his attorney. Barnett and a doctor disputed the Mans\u2019s claim about Natalia\u2019s age. In January 2018, the Manses withdrew the petition to change Natalia\u2019s birth year, and the case was dismissed.\n\nOther adoptive parents say Ukraine has a history of falsifying birth certificates\n\nKim Thompson, another Indiana parent who adopted a child from Ukraine, says she may know why Natalia\u2019s age is so confusing.\n\n\u201cI will say that Ukraine is above all else corrupt, and birth certificates were completely fabricated,\u201d she told Insider.\n\nHer son, she said, once explained to her how kids determined their ages in the orphanage.\n\n\u201cKids would base their age compared to the height of other kids,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIf one kid was certain he was 10, a taller kid would be 11, and a shorter kid would be 9.\u201d\n\nRead more: A lawyer for the Ukrainian orphan accused of being an adult posing as a child says her ex-mom is wrong about her age\n\nAs for Natalia\u2019s alleged violent behavior towards the Barnetts, Indiana behavioral therapist John Swineheart says it\u2019s not uncommon for someone with Natalia\u2019s background to act out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s somewhat common for children with severe trauma do things such as smear bodily fluids, become aggressive toward animals and people, or act in an angry or oppositional manner,\u201d Swinehart, who often works with foster and adopted children, told Insider. \u201cThe world is unpredictable to them, so they must act in unpredictable ways to deal with it.\u201d\n\nAntwon Mans acknowledged that Natalia had suffered trauma but declined to elaborate.\n\nA dispute over Natalia\u2019s age led to charges against the Barnetts\n\nEstranged from their daughter, the Barnetts moved on with their lives.\n\nBut on September 5 this year, Tippecanoe County Sheriff Robert Goldsmith questioned Michael Barnett. Just weeks later, prosecutors filed charges against the Barnetts on the alleged neglect and abandonment of Natalia in 2013.\n\ncaption Michael Barnett in court with his attorney, Terrance Kinnard. source USA TODAY NETWORK/Reuters\n\nAccording to court records filed by prosecutors, Natalia was examined by someone named Dr. Riggs at the Peyton Manning Children\u2019s Hospital in Indianapolis on June 3, 2010. Riggs determined her to be approximately eight years old. A skeletal survey at the same hospital two years later concluded she was around 11.\n\nThe records also say Michael Barnett admitted during the September 5 interview that he knew Natalia was a minor when the family left for Canada. Terrance Kinnard, his attorney, denies Barnett admitted anything of the kind.\n\nBut Kristine Barnett continues to claim Natalia was always older than she appeared. \u201cNatalia is and always has been an adult in the time that I knew her but that did not stop me from always seeking her best interest,\u201d she wrote on her Facebook page.\n\nWhile the Barnetts await their trial, Natalia is still living with the Manses\n\nDuring the Barnetts\u2019 first court appearance, attorneys hinted that the family fell victim to an adoption scam.\n\nHowever, Indiana\u2019s neglect statute defines a dependent as \u201ca person of any age who has a mental or physical disability.\u201d\n\nIn other words, due to Natalia\u2019s physical and mental health, it may not matter whether she was or wasn\u2019t a child when the Barnetts moved to Canada, an Indiana prosecutor told Insider.\n\nA confidential hearing on the matter is set for October 15 with a jury trial set for January 28, 2020. If convicted on both counts, the Barnetts could each face up to five years in prison and fines of $10,000.\n\ncaption Kristine Barnett attending a hearing on September 27. source USA TODAY NETWORK/Reuters\n\nKristine lost her job because of the lawsuit, according to a recent Facebook post, and a GoFundMe page has been set up to help her with living and legal expenses.\n\nNatalia continues to live with the Manses and their children, who told Insider they consider her a daughter and sister. Antwon Mans was recently ordained as a pastor. He and his family, including Natalia, have moved into a parsonage behind a small church in a town about an hour from their former home.\n\nFor the most part, the family seems like any other family, with kids playing in the yard, friends and family socializing in the house, and attentive adults ready to help their neighbors with a kind word and gentle handshake.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to post statements on Facebook in the past to ask for our privacy, but people will be people,\u201d said Antwon Mans. \u201cWe\u2019re not concerned.
