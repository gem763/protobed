Factions were later laid bare over the party\u2019s position on whether or not race should be used as a determination for the disadvantaged.\n\nMaimane had argued that race should in fact be used as a proxy as black people remained in the main disadvantaged having been locked out of the mainstream economy during apartheid.\n\nThe former party leader dug his own grave when he appointed a panel to review the organisation \u2013 following a poor performance at the polls in May where the DA lost around 400 000 votes \u2013 made up of former party leader Tony Leon, former party strategist Ryan Coetzee and Capitec founder Michiel le Roux.\n\nThat panel was scathing on Maimane, saying that his leadership had led the party into disarray.\n\nThe report stated that the majority of those consulted commented on his leadership saying that he was conflict averse, inconsistent and indecisive.", "description": "The DA has suffered a double whammy with the resignation of its leader Mmusi Maimane as well as federal chairperson Athol Trollip.", "authors": ["S Thembile Cele"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9512/08df9e3943d448069649476e83243f92.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
