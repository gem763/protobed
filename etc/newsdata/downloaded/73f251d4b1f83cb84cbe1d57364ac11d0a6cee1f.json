But US officials blamed Tehran, charging that the rebels did not have the range or sophistication to target the facilities.\n\nTehran has denied involvement and warned of \"total war\" in the event of any attack on its territory.\n\n- Syria war -\n\nRussia has sought to keep a foot in both camps, offering missiles to Riyadh to defend itself, while at the same time warning against \"hasty conclusions\" regarding Iran's alleged involvement.\n\nLast week, an Iranian tanker was hit in suspected missile strikes off the coast of Saudi Arabia, sparking fresh fears of war.\n\nPutin held talks with the crown prince late Monday do discuss \"bilateral cooperation\" and developments in Syria and Yemen.\n\nRussia and Iran back Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while the Saudis support the opposition seeking his ouster.\n\nBut \"it is important for Russia that an Arab country participates in the political settlement in Syria\", said Lukyanov.\n\nFor now \"only three non-Arab countries\" -- Turkey, Russia and Iran -- are hosting talks, the analyst added.\n\nAfter Saudi Arabia, Putin will travel to the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday to meet the powerful crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan.", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a key deal Monday with Saudi Arabia during a key visit for an OPEC+ grouping aimed at stabilising global oil prices and seeking to calm regional tensions with Iran.
