I still believe in him.\"\n\nDrugs and deaths\n\nDuterte's son, Paolo, now a congressman, and his son-in-law were also accused of being involved in the shipment of US$125m worth of narcotics from China.\n\nAntonio Trillanes, an opposition politician, had also claimed that Duterte's son was a member of a Chinese organised crimegroup.\n\nPaolo Duterte has denied the allegations.\n\nSince Duterte assumed the presidency in mid-2016, some 6,660 people have been killed during drug-related police operations, according to a June 2019 report published by the Philippine National Police.\n\nBut human rights advocates say the number could be upwards of 27,000.\n\nIn July, the United Nations Human Rights Council approved a resolution seeking action on Duterte's drug war.\n\nThe office of UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet is expected to release a \"comprehensive report on the human rights situation\" in the Philippines by June 2020.\n\nUN officials earlier told Al Jazeera that they were in touch with Philippine officials, as they prepare the report.\n\nDuterte's spokesman, Salvador Panelo, had called the vote and the upcoming report as an \"outrageous interference\" in the sovereignty of the Philippines.", "description": "General Oscar Albayalde allegedly intervened in the prosecution of officers accused of selling seized drugs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/14/a9a2bde567cb47dc98c3a87a9ef1e685_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
