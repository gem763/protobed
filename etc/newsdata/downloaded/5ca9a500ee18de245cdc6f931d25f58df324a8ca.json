Underneath his smokey red and black eyeshadow, the word \u201cslut\u201d was drawn on his cheek.\n\nWhat was the inspiration for this look, besides making nanas clutch their pearls everywhere? According to makeup artist Lisa Houghton, it was all Miller\u2019s idea. On a post on her Instagram, Houghton said that Miller knew what he wanted, right from the get-go. \u201c\u2018I want you to write the word slut on my cheek\u2019\u201d was literally his opening statement when asked about his desires for the look,\u201d she wrote, calling the move \u201cpersonal to Ezra and his spiritual and political ethos.\u201d\n\nYes, but what does it mean? Is Miller a slut? Are we the sluts? Is the world a slut? All three?\n\nPhoto: Bertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty Images\n\nOf course, this look is part of Miller\u2019s signature, as the actor has been known to fearlessly experiment with his style over the years. Previous red carpet looks have include Harry Potter spells written on his palms, a goth sleeping bag, and multiple eyes painted on his face in an optical-illusion for this year\u2019s Met Gala. Beauty brand Urban Decay obviously noticed Miller\u2019s penchant for daring makeup looks, making him one of its \u201cglobal citizens,\u201d alongside Lizzo and Joey King in June of this year.\n\nWhile we might not know exactly what Miller wanted to convey with his edgy makeup of choice, we do know one thing: he\u2019ll never look boring.\n\nStay in touch.
