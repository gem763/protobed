He was like, 'Yep, if there's an opportunity let's really go for it.'\"\n\nThe All Blacks received the kickoff, and Perenara went for it. He slipped through Namibia's first line of defense on the left and carried the attack past halfway. He offloaded to wing George Bridge, and Rieko Ioane offloaded to replacement scrumhalf Brad Weber. Perenara was back up and in support when he received an outrageous behind-the-back pass from Weber 20 meters out.\n\nPerenara was too quick for Namibia hooker Obert Nortje but was slammed by flyhalf Helarius Kisting. But Perenara, falling over the touchline, had just enough momentum to twist and plant the ball beside the left corner flag.\n\nNew Zealand's T J Perenara looks to score a try as he is tackled by Namibia's Helarius Kisting during the Rugby World Cup Pool B game at Tokyo Stadium between New Zealand and Namibia in Tokyo, Japan, Sunday, Oct. 6, 2019.

If it was the other way round, and I passed the ball to him, he probably runs around and scores under the sticks, he's that quick.\n\n\"I knew I had the ball down (beside the flag), I just thought my feet were out. The 10 made a good tackle on me, and I tried to get my feet in the air and I thought he had kept me down.\"\n\nAfter a lengthy video review, the try was given, New Zealand's 11th in a 71-9 win.\n\nAttack coach Ian Foster quipped about how it was the coaches' fault for putting two 9s - Perenara and Weber - on the field together.\n\n\"Mayhem was always going to happen,\" Foster joked.\n\nSeriously, \"I take my hat off to them. TJ made some really good decisions (at flyhalf) and Brad (who replaced Aaron Smith) provided a little special moment with that pass. The scoreboard enabled them to express themselves the way they wanted, and they got away with it.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nNew Zealand's T J Perenara rolls away from the ball after scoring a try as he is tackled by Namibia's Helarius Kisting during the Rugby World Cup Pool B game at Tokyo Stadium between New Zealand and Namibia in Tokyo, Japan, Sunday, Oct. 6, 2019.
