Marvel reacquired the rights to the character, as well as Ghost Rider and the Punisher back in 2013. Marvel brought in Ghost Rider (which had been a pair of films starring Nicholas Cage), and the Punisher (another two films), for Agents of SHIELD, and its Netflix superhero franchise, starting with Daredevil, respectively.\n\nMarvel didn\u2019t release any additional details about when we\u2019ll see Blade back in action, nor what form \u2014 at this point it could be either a series for Disney+ or a feature film. There are certainly plenty of opportunities for both in the coming years.\n\nThe character was born Eric Brooks, and is half-human, half vampire. He first appeared in comics in 1973 in The Tomb of Dracula #10, and after saving a man from vampires, turned to hunting them.\n\nSomething that the studio will need to figure out at some point is how to reconcile Ali\u2019s role as Blade and as Cornell \u201cCottonmouth\u201d Stokes from Netflix\u2019s Luke Cage series, which is technically a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well (albeit loosely, given the tenuous connections between the franchises). For that matter, he was also the voice of Miles Morales\u2019 Uncle Aaron in Sony\u2019s Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse. He\u2019s certainly no stranger to superheroes.", "description": "One of the bombshell announcements during Marvel\u2019s Hall H presentation at San Diego Comic-Con tonight was that the studio would be rebooting Blade, with True Detective and Luke Cage actor Mahershala Ali set to star.", "authors": ["Andrew Liptak", "Jul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZnhwP6Y7J-O15dykAt7_14IXeNY=/0x162:680x518/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18323897/D_9mcOBVUAYL1yw.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-07-20"}
