REUTERS/Stringer\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest steel producer and consumer last month took in 370,000 tonnes of steel semis from overseas, according to data released by the General Administration of Customs on Wednesday.\n\nThat was up 418% year-on-year and marked the highest monthly total in records on the customs website going back to June 2014. It was also up from 260,000 tonnes in August.\n\n\u201cThe rising imports came after China tightened restrictions on steel scrap imports,\u201d said Zhuo Guiqiu, an analyst with Jinrui Futures, noting that some countries in East and Southeast Asia had to process steel scrap into semi-finished products to keep selling into China.\n\nChina tightened restrictions on scrap metal imports from July 1, as part of a sweeping campaign against \u201cforeign garbage\u201d.\n\nIt bought less than 10,000 tonnes of steel scrap in September and merely 180,000 tonnes in the first nine months of 2019, down 83.7% from a year earlier.\n\nSemi-finished steel product imports, mostly consisting of steel billets, meanwhile rose 53.1% year-on-year in the first three quarters to 1.37 million tonnes, customs data showed.\n\n\u201cThe imports were also fueled by widening price variance,\u201d said Zhuo. \u201cChina\u2019s billet price is about $50 higher per tonne than in Southeast Asia and $70 than West Asia.\u201d\n\nSome analysts and traders told Reuters they had also noticed increasing amounts of hot-rolled coil from Russia arriving in China\u2019s Yangtze River Delta region.\n\n\u201cThe global economy is cooling and steel demand is stagnating, except in China,\u201d said Tang Binghua, an analyst from Founder CIFCO Futures.\n\nTwo traders from Jiangsu and Fujian provinces said they were planning to expand imports of finished or semi-finished steel products because of favorable prices overseas.\n\nChina bought 1.1 million tonnes of finished steel products in September, up from 970,000 tonnes in August and 840,000 tonnes in July, the customs data showed.\n\n\u201cWe will have more billets from Iran in the near future,\u201d the Jiangsu-based trader said.", "description": "China's imports of semi-finished steel surged in September as a crackdown on scrap shipments saw Chinese buyers scoop up alternative forms of the metal from other Asian countries at favorable prices.", "authors": ["Min Zhang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444066458&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0QZ", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
