Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nYou can do it a Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT), and you can do it at Tampa International Airport (TPA).\n\nNow Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW) will let you do it, too.\n\nStarting Tuesday Detroit Metro Airport will allow non-ticketed guests to spend time on the post-security side of both the McNamara and North terminals.\n\nThe \u201cDTW Destination Pass\u201d program allows non-flyers to come to the airport to shop, eat, check out the art, plane spot, people watch, escort a friend or family to their gate or be there when a loved one deplanes.\n\n\u201cThe new regulations allow us to expand our gate pass program that already exists for our Westin hotel guests,\u201d said Wayne County Airport Authority CEO Chad Newton in a statement, \u201cNow we can welcome more community members into our home to create memorable moments \u2014 from watching planes to greeting family and friends.\u201d\n\nDTW\u2019s Destination Pass program isn\u2019t permanent (yet) but is being piloted through the holidays with an end date of Jan. 5, 2020.\n\nOther airports invite non-ticketed visitors, too\n\nWhile DTW\u2019s Destination Pass is being piloted, the gate-pass programs at Pittsburgh International Airport and Tampa International Airport are permanent.\n\nPIT kicked off the trend with the \u201cmyPIT Pass\u201d program in August 2017. The program operates Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Non-ticketed visitors may apply for a pass by showing a U.S. government-issued photo ID at a special counter in the terminal.\n\nThe Tampa airport introduced its TPA All Access Pass in April 2019. TPA\u2019s pass allows non-ticketed guests who apply at least 24 hours in advance to visit one of four airside areas of the airport each Saturday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. There is a limit of 25 people per airside.\n\n\"The All-Access program is well,\" said TPA spokeswoman Emily Nipps. \"According to the surveys we conduct following our guests' visits, they love it. No issues at security checkpoints, no issues with the additional people at our airside terminals.\"\n\nSeattle-Tacoma International Airport tested a gate-pass program for a few weeks during the 2018 holiday season and had 1,165 people take advantage of the program. Airport spokesman Perry Cooper says the decision to bring back the program on a temporary or permanent basis is still under review.\n\nAccording to Transportation Security Administration spokeswoman Lorie Dankers, before any airport can offer a gate-pass program to non-ticketed fliers, the airport must submit a formal proposal to the TSA to amend the local airport security plan. If TSA approves the plan, an airport is permitted to invite non-ticketed passengers past security.\n\nSo perhaps we\u2019re seeing the beginning of a trend.\n\nHow the new Detroit post-security pass works\n\nThe \u201cDTW Destination Pass\u201d program allows non-flying guests to head to the Detroit Metro Airport to shop, eat, check out the art, plane spot, people watch, escort a friend or family to their gate or be there when a loved one deplanes. (Photo: Detroit Metro Airport)\n\nUp to 75 non-ticketed passengers a day will be able to enter the secure side of both DTW terminals from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday.\n\nVisitors will need to apply for a pass through the DTW website the day before their planned visit. Applicants will get an email notification letting them know if the application has been approved. If approved, detailed instructions will be sent electronically.\n\nPass holders will need to go through the same security screening as all other passengers going through the security checkpoints. During peak checkpoint times, passengers heading to flights will get priority over pass holders at the checkpoints.\n\nAfter their visit, pass holders will be asked to fill out a survey.\n\nWhen the pilot program is done, \u201cWayne County Airport Authority will be evaluating the use of the program, along with the airport\u2019s cost to provide this service. We will also be reviewing the completed participant surveys,\u201d said airport spokeswoman Lisa Gass.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2019/10/22/dtw-pit-tpa-airports-non-flyers-past-security-how-works/4059418002/", "description": "The Detroit Metro Airport joins Pittsburgh and Tampa in allowing non-flyers to go through the security checkpoints.", "authors": ["Harriet Baskas", "Special To Usa Today", "Published A.M.
