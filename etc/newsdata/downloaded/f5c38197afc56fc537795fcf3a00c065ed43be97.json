This video will astound you | CBC Music", "language": "en", "text": "French theremin virtuoso Gr\u00e9goire Blanc spent some time in Montreal recently and while there, he met local clarinetist Jenny Maclay and pianist Julien LeBlanc and enlisted them to play an arrangement of Reinhold Gli\u00e8re's Concerto for Coloratura and Orchestra, Op. 82, at l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al's Salle Serge-Garant.\n\nThe piece is a successor to Rachmaninoff's famous Vocalise, Op. 34, No. 14, in which a soprano's wordless lines intertwine with, and soar over, the orchestra. Because the theremin is so good at replicating the human voice, Gli\u00e8re's Concerto is a perfect fit for this unusual instrument whose inventor, L\u00e9on Theremin, was the protagonist of Sean Michael's Giller Prize-winning novel, Us Conductors.\n\nPatented in 1928, the theremin has a small but devoted following of enthusiasts, but it remains a marginal instrument. With 25,000 YouTube subscribers, Blanc is determined to change that. If you've never seen someone play a theremin \u2014 an electronic instrument that's controlled without any physical contact by the performer \u2014 then Blanc's video will astound you.
