It\u2019s believed Kendall earns around $611,000 (\u00a3471,700) per paid post.\n\nSome of Kendall\u2019s most recent sponsored posts include an ad with Valentino, skincare brand Proactiv, Reserved, Aritzia and Stuart Weitzman \u2013 and that\u2019s just in the past month so we\u2019d love to see Kendall\u2019s bank balance by Christmas.\n\nKendall has 117 million followers on the social media platform compared to her younger sister Kylie, who boasts 149 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also less than their big sister Kim Kardashian, who just this week surpassed them all to reach 150 million followers, making her one of the most popular celebrities on Instagram. But surprisingly, the SKIMS founder is nowhere to be seen on the list.\n\nTaking the top spot is Cristiano Ronaldo who reportedly earns an estimated $34 million (\u00a326.2 million) a year from sponsored posts. If the 34-year-old feels like retiring early it seems he can survive off Instagram alone as Buzz Bingo claims his social media earnings are more than his income from football club Juventus.\n\nCristiano proudly holds the crown as the most followed celebrity on Instagram with a staggering 184 million accounts following his every move.\n\nElsewhere on the list is David Beckham at number four with $10.7 million (\u00a38.2 million) per year, Selena Gomez at number five with $8 million (\u00a36.1 million), Kylie with $3.8 million (\u00a33 million) at number eight, and Khloe Kardashian rounding off the top 10 with a cool $1.2 million (\u00a3926,000) per year.\n\nHighest-paid celebrities on Instagram\n\nCristiano Ronaldo\n\n$47.8 million per year ($975,000 per post)\n\nLionel Messi\n\n$23.3 million per year ($648,000 per post)\n\nKendall Jenner\n\n$15.9 million per year ($611,000 per post)\n\nDavid Beckham\n\n$10.7 million per year ($357,000 per post)\n\nSelena Gomez\n\n$8 million per year ($886,000 per post)\n\nNeymar Jr\n\n$7.2 million per year ($722,000 per post)\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic\n\n$4 million per year ($200,000 per post)\n\nKylie Jenner\n\n$3.8 million per year ($1.27 million per post)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRonaldinho\n\n$2.6 million per year ($256,000 per post)\n\nKhloe Kardashian\n\n$1.2 million per year ($598,000 per post)\n\nGot a showbiz story?
