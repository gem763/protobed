REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins/File Photo\n\nIn a 15-count indictment, U.S. prosecutors allege that Ahsha Tribble, who oversaw the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s efforts to restore electrical power after the hurricane, accepted helicopter rides, hotel rooms and other bribes from Donald Ellison, who was then president of Cobra Acquisitions LLC, which was contracted to do the work.\n\nIn return, Tribble pressured FEMA and the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) to steer work to Ellison\u2019s firm, prosecutors said. PREPA said that Cobra was paid $1.1 billion of a contracted $1.9 billion. The contracts were canceled by the utility in March when it \u201cbecame aware of possible irregularities,\u201d PREPA said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nTribble was not immediately reachable for comment.\n\nEllison, who left Cobra in June, denies wrongdoing and will plead not guilty, his attorney William Leone said in a telephone interview. \u201cThis indictment is filled with allegations of innocuous events that somehow the government has cobbled into a theory of bribery,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a crime to be friends with people you work with.\u201d\n\nProsecutors also charged Jovanda Patterson, a former FEMA deputy chief of staff, who they say evaluated Cobra\u2019s work even as she was trying to get a job with the company.\n\nPatterson was not immediately reachable for comment.\n\nAll three defendants have been arrested, officials said.\n\n\u201cDefendants arrived in Puerto Rico to allegedly help in the recovery of the devastation left from Hurricane Maria,\u201d U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodr\u00edguez-V\u00e9lez said at a news conference. \u201cHowever, they decided to take advantage of the precarious conditions of our power grid and became involved in a bribery and electronic fraud scheme to illegally enrich themselves with our suffering.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials have put tighter spending controls on federal money earmarked for Puerto Rico\u2019s recovery efforts, which have been slow.\n\nThe indictment follows a recent tweet by President Donald Trump calling Puerto Rico \u201cone of the most corrupt places on earth,\u201d while his White House accused the island of misusing federal money.\n\nNearly $42.7 billion of federal funds have been allocated to Puerto Rico, which has received $13.8 billion so far.\n\nFEMA, PREPA, and Cobra\u2019s parent company, Mammoth Energy Services Inc (TUSK.O), said they were cooperating with the investigation.\n\nCharges filed against Tribble and Ellison include conspiracy to commit bribery, honest-services wire fraud and disaster fraud.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Workers repairs electrical installations after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria in San Juan, Puerto Rico, September 26, 2017.

Ellison has sued to try to get that property back.\n\nAfter the hurricane, PREPA, which filed for bankruptcy in 2017, was faced with a decimated electric grid already struggling due to poor rate collection, heavy management turnover and lack of maintenance.\n\nTrump has had disputes with Puerto Rico\u2019s leaders after coming under heavy criticism for a tepid response to the hurricane, which resulted in almost 3,000 deaths.", "description": "The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday announced corruption charges against a senior government official and a contractor who oversaw the rebuilding of Puerto Rico's electrical grid after Hurricane Maria devastated the island in 2017.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428473203&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF891TD", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
