(Picture: MEGA)\n\nKai Rooney enjoyed some fun in the sun while holidaying with dad Wayne in Bridgetown, Barbados.\n\nThe DC United footballer and family are currently enjoying a getaway on the Caribbean island\u2019s luxury Sandy Lane hotel, which has its own private beach.\n\nWayne and Kai have been joined over half term by the footballer\u2019s two middle sons, Klay, six, and Kit, three, as well as his in-laws Colette and Anthony McLoughlin.\n\nEarly on Sunday morning, Kai decided to make the most of the hotel\u2019s facilities and take part in some outdoor activities, living out the jet pack dream while flyboarding, an activity which sees water spray from the boots and propel the user into the air.\n\nWearing brightly coloured swimming shorts, the nine-year-old football protege looked to be having the time of his life as he got to grips with the exhilarating activity, screaming with excitement and waving back at his family on dry land from the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather you than us, eh Kai?\n\nWe feel a bit queasy looking at this, honestly (Picture: MEGA)\n\nRock and roll, dude! (Picture: Isla/Backgrid)\n\nThe family unit has been missing two very important figures during their trip for Wayne\u2019s birthday, as Wayne\u2019s wife Coleen stayed at home with their youngest son Cass due to illness.\n\nExplaining why she didn\u2019t join her family on the trip, Coleen recently said: \u2018Lovely morning in the fresh air with Cass.\n\nColeen\u2019s son is truly fearless (Picture: Isla/Backgrid)\n\n\u2018We had planned to be with the rest of our family in Barbados for half term break.\n\n\u2018Unfortunately I became poorly with an infection before we were due to leave.\n\nThe Rooney clan (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018I am not able to join them for the time being, even though I am feeling better.\u2019\n\nNo doubt Coleen has been in need of a break after an, erm, challenging month.\n\nEarlier this month, Coleen shocked the nation when she claimed false stories about her were leaked from Rebekah Vardy\u2019s Instagram account.\n\nRebekah vehemently denied the allegations but Coleen claimed to have screenshots as evidence.\n\nAn investigation is reportedly being carried out by Rebekah\u2019s team to prove her innocence.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
