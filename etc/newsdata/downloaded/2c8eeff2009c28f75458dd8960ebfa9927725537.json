Fishing boats tend to be a little bit more Wild West than the merchant fleets as a rule, but the fact that it's primarily Chinese doesn't really fit with that because the predominant fishing fleets in the South Atlantic are Taiwanese and Japanese,\" Prof Ryan observed.\n\n\"I think the evidence is pretty strong that it's coming from merchant shipping,\" he suggested.\n\n\"It is where we've seen the really big increase in shipping, particularly from South America to Asia over the last decade or so. It came as a bit of a shock to me because I had assumed that the merchant fleets would be reasonably compliant [to international agreements not to throw waste overboard].\"\n\nProf Ryan said that he would be interested to hear what the international shipping sector made of the findings, adding: \"I think we need to look quite carefully at better monitoring and enforcement of regulations.\"", "description": "A remote island in the southern Atlantic Ocean reveals the scale of the problem of plastic waste facing our seas.", "authors": ["Mark Kinver", "Environment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/FD2D/production/_109031846_bottle_ryan.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
