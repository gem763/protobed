REUTERS/Staff\n\nThe European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published a framework that supervisors can use to test the resilience of funds to shocks.\n\nESMA said that in a case study it applied the framework to 6,600 EU-registered bond funds worth 2.5 trillion euros ($2.8 trillion) to simulate a redemption shock, or heavy calls from investors for their cash.\n\n\u201cThe results show that overall, most funds are able to cope with such extreme but plausible shocks, as they have enough liquid assets to meet investors\u2019 redemption requests,\u201d ESMA said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHowever, pockets of vulnerabilities are identified, especially for high yield (HY) bond funds.\u201d\n\nUnder the new framework\u2019s \u201csevere\u201d assumptions, up to 40% of high yield bond funds tested could end up with too little liquid assets to meet redemptions.\n\nIn return for a credit rating below investment grade, riskier high yield bonds offer higher interest rates to investors and are attractive at times of historically low central bank rates.\n\nThe watchdog\u2019s case study also looked at the impact on markets of the need for bond funds to sell assets to meet cash calls, which typically puts downward pressure on asset prices.\n\nThe pressure was limited for most asset classes but material for high yield and emerging market bonds, ESMA said.\n\nESMA Chair Steven Maijoor said the stress simulation framework will help ensure resilience to shocks in the overall EU-regulated funds sector, which has grown rapidly to 9.3 trillion euros last year, from 6.2 trillion euros in 2007.\n\nThe ability of funds to meet redemption calls has become a hot topic for regulators in Britain after a retail equities fund run by high-profile asset manager Neil Woodford was suspended in June.\n\nThe Woodford fund was unable to meet demands from investors for their cash despite advertising itself as offering daily redemptions.", "description": "Some EU-registered high-yield bond funds would be potentially unable to meet cash calls if a flood of investors asked for their money back, European Union regulators said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426491946&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF840W6", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
