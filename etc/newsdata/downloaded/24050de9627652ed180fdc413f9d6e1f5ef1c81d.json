The guards were found at dawn by a patient who had arrived at the facility before others.\n\nAfter hearing the guards' screams, the patient summoned help from nurses living in adjoining properties.\n\n\"We are completely taken aback, dismayed and disgusted by this incident. It is a crying shame. You just know that something has gone terribly wrong in society when a place that the community turns to for its healthcare needs, such as a clinic, is targeted and destroyed in such fashion. Even during apartheid, healthcare workers and the facilities where they worked were spared from harm.", "description": "Four armed men have made of with a 4x4 vehicle, 14 computers, three television sets and a microwave oven from a clinic in KwaZulu-Natal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9387/455de88495da49f895597e8c33f6d56a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
