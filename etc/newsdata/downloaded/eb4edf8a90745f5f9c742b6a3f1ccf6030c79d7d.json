REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\n\nDrone sightings at Gatwick, Britain\u2019s second-busiest airport, led to about 1,000 flight cancellations and disrupted the travel plans of 140,000 passengers in the run-up to Christmas.\n\nThe Heathrow Pause group plans to fly toy drones from 0200 GMT on Friday within a 5 km restricted zone around the airport but outside the flight paths of the airport, a step the group said would force the airport to ground flights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very confident that we\u2019ve taken the learning from Gatwick,\u201d said London police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe aviation industry and national policing have been working hard to look at measures to mitigate those issues we saw at Gatwick and I\u2019m confident in the tactics that we\u2019ve got in place that we won\u2019t see a repeat of what happened at Gatwick,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nTaylor declined to discuss specific tactics but said the police had robust plans in place which included the ability to detect and identify drones and also the use of counter-drones.\n\n\u201cIf people come to the airport intent on committing criminal activity they will be arrested,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEndangering the life of passengers, flying drones without permission within the exclusion zone, attempting to disrupt the airport is very serious. We will enforce the law and we will use legislation available to us ... to prevent that from happening.\u201d\n\nHeathrow Pause, a splinter group of the climate activism group Extinction Rebellion which has disrupted London with high profile demonstrations this year, said it would fly drones at no higher than head level and give the airport one hour\u2019s advance notice.\n\nThe airport has said the plan is illegal and counterproductive but that it too had robust plans in place to make sure the airport could continue to operate.", "description": "British police said they were confident an attempt by climate change activists to disrupt London's Heathrow airport with toy drones from Friday would not lead to a repeat of the chaos seen at Gatwick last December.", "authors": ["Kylie Maclellan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428722503&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1A8", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
