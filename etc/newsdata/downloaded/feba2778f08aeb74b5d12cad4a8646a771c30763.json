The IMF said Argentina, the second biggest economy in South America, was a special case.\n\nBut the JDC said Argentina was merely the most acute example of a wider problem, with the IMF also encouraging reckless lending in 17 other countries: Afghanistan; Angola; Cameroon; Central African Republic; Chad; Ecuador; Egypt; Ghana; Jordan; Mauritania; Mongolia; Pakistan; S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe; Sierra Leone; Sri Lanka; Tunisia; and Ukraine. The campaign group said that credit agencies had rated Egypt, Pakistan and Ecuador to be high risk.\n\nSarah-Jayne Clifton, director of Jubilee Debt Campaign, said: \u201cThe IMF has a policy not to lend into an unsustainable debt situation, but we are seeing it breach this policy far too often, bailing out reckless lenders. This creates a moral hazard in the sovereign debt system. Lenders and borrowers are jointly responsible for ensuring debt crises are prevented.\n\n\u201cBy constantly bailing out countries in debt crisis without requiring debt restructuring, the IMF is placing the burden of a crisis squarely on the shoulders of the citizens of a debtor country, letting lenders off the hook and ensuring the cycle of debt crises continues.\u201d\n\nThe IMF defended its approach. A spokesman said: \u201cThe methodology used in the Jubilee report is flawed, starting with the misleading headline number of $93bn. More than half that amount is accounted for by one programme \u2013 Argentina, which has unique circumstances.\n\n\u201cThe claim that the IMF\u2019s own rules are being breached is not true. We have clear guidelines about not lending into unsustainable debt situations and all programmes require approval by the IMF\u2019s executive board, representing 189 countries.\n\n\u201cThe Jubilee report also shows a lack of understanding of the IMF\u2019s lending policies. Our decisions to lend to countries are not simply based on numerical thresholds, but on comprehensive debt sustainability analyses and policies needed to address economic imbalances and debt burdens.\u201d\n\nThe JDC said its argument that the IMF should have required a debt restructuring before agreeing to the loan had been supported by the factthat Argentina was now having to restructure the debt a year later. \u201c[The IMF] have a policy not to lend into unsustainable debt situations, and we have presented 18 cases where they are doing exactly that.\u201d\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nLast year\u2019s IMF loan came only two years after Argentina agreed to repay a proportion of the loans left over from its bankruptcy in 2002, which left $82bn of debts unpaid.\n\nThe deal with a group of \u201cvulture\u201d hedge funds led by Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management landed Argentina with a $4.6bn bill. The move was expected to clear the way for Argentina to access global debt markets after being excluded for 14 years, but a recovery in the nation\u2019s finances failed to materialise and it was quickly forced again to the edge of bankruptcy.\n\nAs part of the IMF deal, Argentina agreed to reduce its fiscal deficit to 1.3% of GDP this year, down from 2.2% previously and a balanced budget next year. However, concerns that a general election later this month will oust incumbent president, Mauricio Macri, in favour of the populist Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez and his running mate, the former president Cristina de Kirchner, triggered a flight of investors, a run on the currency and sent the interest rate on the country\u2019s publicly traded debts soaring.", "description": "Jubilee Debt Campaign says the Fund broke its own rules by not ensuring sustainable debt burden", "authors": ["Larry Elliott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be7681005128ceaa6698fe2a54dc7ad5e34384da/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=56449d5ccb38b68a66e04912b51a2e82", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
