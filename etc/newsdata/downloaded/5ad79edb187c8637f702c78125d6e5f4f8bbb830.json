One Democrat described the testimony as \u201cdamning.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a 15-page opening statement, obtained by The Washington Post, Taylor stood by his characterization that it was \u201ccrazy\u201d to make the assistance contingent on investigations he found troubling.\n\nHe described how officials from the Pentagon, State Department, CIA and former National Security Adviser John Bolton tried unsuccessfully to get a meeting with Trump to release the aid. He testified that Ukrainian officials were blindsided by the White House\u2019s decision to release a rough transcript of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky in which the president asked for a favor with \u201cvirtually no notice of the release and they were livid.\u201d\n\nUpon arriving in Kyiv last spring Taylor became alarmed by secondary diplomatic channels involving U.S. officials that he called \u201cweird,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTaylor walked lawmakers through a series of conversations he had with other U.S. diplomats who were trying to obtain what one had called the \u201cdeliverable\u201d of Ukrainian help investigating Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\n\u201cIn August and September of this year, I became increasingly concerned that our relationship with Ukraine was being fundamentally undermined by an irregular informal channel of U.S. policy-making and by the withholding of vital security assistance for domestic political reasons,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nTaylor\u2019s testimony filled in some blanks about the activities of U.S. officials who appear to have sought Ukrainian help at the behest of Trump and his personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani.\n\nAD\n\nAt issue is whether the White House conditioned military aid and a meeting between the two presidents on Zelensky\u2019s cooperation, and whether that constitutes an abuse of Trump\u2019s office.\n\nAD\n\nTaylor contradicted earlier testimony from Gordon Sondland, Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, a key player in the effort to draw Ukraine into the election-related investigations.\n\nSondland told House investigators last week that he recalls \u201cno discussions\u201d with anyone at the State Department or White House about investigating former vice president and 2020 president candidate Joe Biden or his son, Hunter.\n\nTaylor testified that Trump told Sondland himself in a September 7 phone call that Zelensky must \u201cgo to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference, and that President Zelensky should want to do this himself.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe contents of this conversation were given to Taylor by the White House official in charge of Europe, Tim Morrison, who after hearing that call notified Bolton and National Security Council lawyers, Taylor said.\n\nAD\n\nIn a crucial Sept. 8 telephone call, Taylor testified, Sondland \u201ctried to explain to me that President Trump is a businessman. When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, he said, the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check.\u201d\n\nSondland\u2019s lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nHouse Democrats are expected to use Taylor\u2019s account of his conversations with Sondland to show that Trump had issued clear orders about what he wanted from Zelensky.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDuring that phone call, Amb. Sondland told me that President Trump had told him that he wants President Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election,\u201d Taylor testified.\n\nHunter Biden had been a board member of Burisma, a large Ukrainian gas company. Joe Biden is a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAmb. Sondland also told me that he now recognized that he had made a mistake by earlier telling the Ukrainian officials to whom he spoke that a White House meeting with President Zelensky was dependent on a public announcement of investigations \u2014 in fact, Amb. Sondland said, \u2018everything\u2019 was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance,\u2019\u201d Taylor told House investigators.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe said that President Trump wanted President Zelensky \u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement about ordering such investigations.\u2019\u201d\n\nAn official working on the impeachment inquiry said Tuesday that Taylor is testifying under subpoena after the State Department attempted to block his appearance.\n\n\u201cThe House Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena to compel his testimony this morning,\u201d said the official, who requested anonymity to discuss the arrangements. \u201cAs is required of him, Ambassador Taylor is now complying with the subpoena and answering questions from both Democratic and Republican Members and staff.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was just the most damning testimony I\u2019ve heard,\u201d Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) said in an interview partway into Taylor\u2019s testimony.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe drew a very specific direct line from President Trump to the withholding of foreign aid and the refusal of a meeting,\u201d between Trump and the new Ukrainian leader, Wasserman Schultz said.\n\nTaylor testified that he first learned about U.S. military aid being leveraged on a promise by Ukraine to investigate Trump\u2019s political foes in an early September phone call with Morrison. The top National Security Council official described how Sondland had told a Ukrainian official that \u201cthe security assistance money would not come until President Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma investigation,\u201d Taylor testified.\n\nTaylor told lawmaker he was \u201calarmed\u201d by the news. \u201cThis was the first time I had heard that security assistance\u2014not just the White House meeting\u2014was conditioned on the investigations,\u201d he told lawmakers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe same day he texted Sondland to ask if this was correct, a message that is now already public: \u201cWe [are] now saying that security assistance and [a] WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d he wrote.\n\nSondland responded telling Taylor to call him instead of texting.\n\nA few days later, on Sept. 7, Taylor testified that Morrison related to him another conversation that Trump had with Sondland that gave him a \u201csinking feeling.\u201d He told Taylor that Trump \u201cdid insist that President Zelensky go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference, and that President Zelensky should want to do this himself,\u201d Taylor said, summarizing what he heard for lawmakers.\n\nTaylor also told lawmakers that Sondland had explained that Trump is a \u201cbusinessman\u201d and that when a businessman is about to sign a check to someone he asks for what he is owed. Taylor scoffed at the notion that Ukraine \u201cowed\u201d anything to Trump.\n\nAD\n\nAfter they hung up, Taylor sent Sondland a series of text messages saying lay out his concerns about holding up the military aide. That\u2019s when he wrote that \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nSondland responded five hours later after he spoke with Trump, saying there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d\n\nTaylor took the job on temporary assignment earlier this year after the sitting ambassador was removed, in what she told the committees was political retaliation by the Trump administration.\n\nTaylor, a retired former ambassador to Ukraine and a foreign policy elder statesman, had exchanged text messages with two other diplomats in which he called it \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign\u201d and a \u201cnightmare scenario.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like if you have a 1,000 piece puzzle, which is what this is,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said. \u201cThis filled in a ton of that puzzle.\u201d\n\nShe and other Democratic lawmakers said Taylor\u2019s morning testimony stood in contrast to the appearance last week of Sondland, a Trump donor and a key player in efforts to secure a statement from Zelensky committing to investigations.\n\n\u201cThere were many things that Ambassador Sondland didn\u2019t remember that Ambassador Taylor remembered in excruciating detail,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said.\n\nHours before Taylor arrived, Trump called the impeachment inquiry a \u201clynching,\u201d drawing swift condemnation from Democrats. Some accused the president of using race to attempt to distract from what Taylor may say.\n\nTaylor said he agreed to go to Kyiv in June as a placeholder ambassador because he thought the U.S.-Ukraine relationship was at a critical moment following Zelensky\u2019s election last spring.\n\nTaylor said he wanted to reinforce U.S. support for Zelensky\u2019s anti-corruption agenda and his independence from Russia, and that he worried that the relationship would drift after the forced recall of former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. He made it clear within the State Department that he objected to her treatment, and that he worried that the same external political \u201cmachinations\u201d involving Giuliani that led to her ouster were still present, Taylor said.\n\nTaylor said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asked him to take the job with the assurance that \u201cthe policy of string support for Ukraine would continue and that he would support me in defending that policy.\u201d\n\nHis testimony, much of it relaying on what appear to be detailed chronological notes, laid out how what he called the official and unofficial channels dealing with the Zelensky government began to diverge over the summer.\n\nOn July 21, four days before Trump and Zelensky had a phone call in which Trump asked Zelensky to conduct those investigations, Taylor exchanged text messages with Sondland.\n\nZelensky wants Ukraine to be \u201ctaken seriously\u201d and not just serve as \u201can instrument in Washington domestic, reelection politics,\u201d Taylor told Sondland.\n\nAnd on Sept. 1, the day Vice President Pence was set to meet with Zelensky, Taylor again texted Sondland.\n\n\u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d Taylor asked.\n\n\u201cCall me,\u201d Sondland replied, in what Democrats have said is probably an effort to prevent a paper trail.\n\nOn Sept. 8, Taylor and Sondland tried to get on the phone with Kurt Volker, then the special U.S. envoy for Ukraine, but Volker couldn\u2019t hear the conversation.\n\n\u201cGordon and I just spoke,\u201d Taylor texted Volker. \u201cI can brief you if you and Gordon don\u2019t connect.\u201d Taylor continued: \u201cThe nightmare is they give the interview and don\u2019t get the security assistance. The Russians love it. (And I quit.)\u201d\n\nTaylor probably was referring to a potential statement to the press from the Zelensky government committing to the investigations. He was apparently worried that Zelensky would give in, but still not receive his promised aid, and that Russia would then use that opening to portray the new Ukrainian leader as a patsy.\n\nVolker turned over copies of the text messages when he testified voluntarily earlier this month.\n\n\u201cThe message to the Ukrainians (and Russians) we send with the decision on security assistance is key,\u201d Taylor texted the next day. \u201cWith the hold, we have already shaken their faith in us. Thus my nightmare scenario.\u201d\n\nSondland replied, saying that \u201cwe have identified the best pathway forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone,\u201d Taylor replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nFive hours went by before Sondland replied. Sondland later testified that he was relaying only what Trump had told him in an intervening phone call.\n\n\u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have pointed to that message, which differs in tone and detail from the chatty earlier exchanges, as an effort to establish a cover story.\n\nTaylor is a former Army officer and Vietnam War veteran who has served in government posts in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. He is expected to return to his senior position at the U.S. Institute for Peace sometime next year.\n\nHis is the first of two planned closed-door depositions this week.\n\nLaura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense whose portfolio includes Russia and Ukraine, will testify in a closed session Wednesday, according to an official working on the process.", "description": "Acting ambassador to Ukraine William B.
