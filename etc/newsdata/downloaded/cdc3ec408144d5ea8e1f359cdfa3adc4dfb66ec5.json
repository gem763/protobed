I am not going to try and predict what will happen over the next 10 days or so. If I had a good answer to that, I would be a forex trader, not a diplomat,\" Latta said during a presentation which formed part of the KwaZulu-Natal Export Week segment.\n\n\"We have big ambitions for trade with Africa, and especially South Africa, which is a leader and influencer for rest of Africa.\n\n\"It is clear South Africa is a gateway for many businesses wanting to enter Africa, and many large African companies have headquarters in Johannesburg.\"\n\nHe assured the audience that \"[b]ar a few administrative details, any SA exporter will have the same access and experience when exporting to the UK which they have had until now.\n\nMore trade, not blocked trade\n\n\"We want to minimise the sense of uncertainty about Brexit and beyond. We want to be creating more trade, not blocked trade. We want to create more prosperity in SA and in in the UK.\"\n\nHe said the UK was working in partnership with the SA government to identify priorities for making an economic impact.\n\n\"We work to identify things South Africans can do to achieve President Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s aim to improve South Africa's ease of doing business and to look at removing barriers to trade,\" said Latta.\n\n\"We realise the importance of economic growth in SA being about jobs and making a positive impact on people\u2019s daily lives.
