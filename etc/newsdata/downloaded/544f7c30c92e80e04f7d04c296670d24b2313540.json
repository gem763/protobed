Given what\u2019s transpired, he probably can\u2019t wait for it to be done.\n\nCome next year, Hern\u00e1ndez expects to pitch far more effectively - even if it\u2019s not for the Seattle Mariners.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez labored through five innings in what was likely his penultimate start with Seattle, and the Baltimore Orioles got home runs from Anthony Santander and Hanser Alberto in a 5-3 victory on Friday night.\n\nSeattle rookie Kyle Lewis hit a two-run homer in the first inning, and Hern\u00e1ndez (1-7) gave the lead back in the bottom half after throwing just eight pitches.\n\nThe Mariners never recovered.\n\nIt\u2019s been a rough season for Hern\u00e1ndez, who missed 3 \u00bd months with a shoulder injury and has gone 13 starts since his lone victory on April 1. The seven-year contract he signed in 2013 expires after this season, and the rebuilding Mariners are unlikely to bring back the six-time All Star and 2010 Cy Young Award winner.\n\nThus, the future appears uncertain for Hern\u00e1ndez beyond his start next week in Seattle.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be emotional. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be quiet,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be happy. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nHern\u00e1ndez knows this much: If he has anything to do with it, it won\u2019t be his last time on the mound.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to retire yet. I think I can go out there and compete against anybody,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIt was a tough year with my shoulder. But if I get healthy, I can compete.\u201d\n\nHern\u00e1ndez made his debut with the Mariners as a 19-year-old in 2005 and has spent his entire career within the organization while earning the nickname \u201cKing Felix.\u201d\n\nLooking to build on his previous outing, in which he limited the White Sox to one run over seven innings, Hern\u00e1ndez got off to a miserable start.\n\nJonathan Villar singled, Trey Mancini walked and Santander homered over the center field wall. A double and wild pitch ensued before Baltimore\u2019s first out of the game, a run-scoring grounder by Austin Hays, made it 4-2.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough first inning,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know that ball was out of the ballpark. I thought it was a fly ball. After that, I kept making pitches and I got through five. So I\u2019m happy with that.\u201d\n\nLewis doubled and scored in the fourth, but Alberto homered in the bottom half to restore the two-run cushion.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez needed 91 pitches to get 15 outs. His line included five runs, eight hits, two walks and two wild pitches.\n\n\u201cI give him credit. He hung in there and got through five innings, which after the first three hitters, I didn\u2019t know if that was going to be the case or not,\u201d manager Scott Servais said. \u201cHe righted the ship.\u201d\n\nPlaying in his 10th major league game, Lewis hit his sixth home run and raised his batting average to .325.\n\nAaron Brooks (6-8) threw seven innings of one-hit ball in relief of opener Richard Bleier to help the Orioles end Seattle\u2019s five-game winning streak.\n\n\u201cThat was the best we\u2019ve seen Brooksie all year,\u201d manager Brandon Hyde said. \u201cThat was three pitches for strikes, really in control the entire time.\u201d\n\nIt was the longest outing by an Orioles reliever since Arthur Rhodes went seven innings against Kansas City in July 1995.\n\nMANCINI MVP\n\nTrey Mancini has been named the Orioles Most Valuable Player in 2019, as voted by the media that regularly cover the team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise to me,\u201d Hyde said. \u201cWell deserved. He\u2019s had an amazing year.\u201d\n\nMancini came into Friday\u2019s game batting .286 with 36 doubles, 34 homers, 93 RBIs and 100 runs scored.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nMariners: OF Mitch Haniger (ruptured testicle) appears done for the season. He has not played since June 6 and \u201cstill has a few issues going on,\u201d manager Scott Servais said. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re at the point in the season where it doesn\u2019t look great for him getting back on the field.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMariners: LHP Justus Sheffield (0-1, 5.40 ERA) faces Baltimore for the first time in his career as the three-game series continues Saturday night.\n\nOrioles: RHP Asher Wojciechowski (3-8, 5.38) starts on the mound, five days after ending an eight-start winless streak with a victory at Detroit.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez isn't getting emotional as the end of the season draws closer.
