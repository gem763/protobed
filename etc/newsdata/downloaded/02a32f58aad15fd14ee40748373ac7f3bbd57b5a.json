What if you cared so much about loyalty and the troops because you first identified as conservative?\n\nIn a series of analyses published recently in the American Journal of Political Science, the three researchers found that people\u2019s moral codes don\u2019t cause or predict their political ideology; instead, people\u2019s ideology appears to predict their answers on the moral-foundations questionnaire. As Peter Hatemi, one of the study\u2019s authors and a political-science professor at Pennsylvania State University, puts it: \u201cWe will switch our moral compass depending on how it fits with what we believe politically.\u201d\n\nHatemi and his co-authors based their analysis on existing data from more than a thousand participants in the American National Election Studies panel from 2008, as well as from a sample of hundreds of Australians originally polled between 2007 and 2011\u2014in both cases, participants took some version of the moral-foundations questionnaire. The trio also administered the moral-foundations questionnaire and a survey about political attitudes to hundreds more Americans from Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk platform.\n\nAfter gathering all this data, the researchers performed statistical analyses to see if people\u2019s moral-foundations answers would help predict, or cause, their political ideology. The answer in both cases was no: Knowing someone\u2019s scores on the questionnaire didn\u2019t help meaningfully predict whether they would have liberal or conservative values several months or years later. However, the reverse held up. People\u2019s political ideology could point toward their moral-foundations answers.\n\nNeedless to say, moral and political convictions are complicated. How any one person develops his or her beliefs is always a strange alchemy of upbringing, culture, and innate predispositions. And political parties often clearly appeal to moral values to defend their positions on a huge variety of charged topics, such as abortion, immigration, and gun control. But the new study suggests these values might at least be slipperier than political parties would like to admit.\n\nHatemi and his team point out two somewhat recent examples of Americans\u2019 party loyalties potentially superseding the moral views they hold. American evangelicals often say they admire morally pure actions and family values, yet in 2016 white evangelicals voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump, a man who has reportedly had extramarital affairs and bragged about grabbing women by their genitals. Some Democrats who align themselves with the #MeToo movement support Bill Clinton, who has been accused of inappropriate sexual conduct.\n\nBoth parties also sometimes rely on similar moral arguments to make opposite cases. The value of life, for instance, has been used by both Democrats and Republicans to support (or oppose) the Affordable Care Act or the death penalty. \u201cPeople tend to forgive things that are done by politicians on their own sides that they would claim is morally over the line on the other side,\u201d says Kevin Smith, a political scientist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and another author of the study.", "description": "A twist in the science of how people form their political identities", "authors": ["Olga Khazan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX6UXS6/facebook.jpg?1568000284", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
