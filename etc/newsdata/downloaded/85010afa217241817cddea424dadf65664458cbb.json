The aircraft, only in use for two months, had problems on its last four flights, including one the day before its fatal accident.\n\nThe Indonesian report followed another last month from U.S. federal accident investigators who concluded that Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration underestimated how a blizzard of visual and auditory warnings would slow pilots\u2019 ability to respond quickly enough to avert crashes.\n\nJust five months after the Indonesian crash, the same kind of malfunction caused a Max jet to crash in Ethiopia, killing all 157 people on board.\n\nThat led to the grounding of all 737 Max jets and put Boeing under intense pressure to explain problems associated with the MCAS system. The aircraft still has not resumed flying.\n\nBoeing recently reported its third-quarter earnings dropped 51% to $1.17 billion in part because it added $900 million more in costs for the Max.\n\n\u201cWe are very angry (at Boeing) because their negligence has caused our loved ones to die,\u201d said Muhammad Asdori, 55, whose brother and nephew were killed in the Lion Air crash.\n\n\u201cThey should have anticipated any kind of problems with adequate training for pilots who fly their planes. We were even more angry when we learned that they had only admitted their mistake when the second MAX8 plane crashed in Ethiopia.\u201d", "description": "An Indonesian investigation found a Lion Air flight that crashed and killed 189 people a year ago was doomed by a combination of aircraft design flaws,...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU003_lion_a_ZG_20191025045957.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
