A student protester was shot in the chest and police had acid thrown on them.\n\nWe followed a group of protesters for five hours in the twin districts of Wong Tai Sin and Diamond Hill, traveling with them from a hidden overpass to watching them snuff out tear gas canisters from the police.\n\nHere is what we saw.\n\nWe started at 2:10 p.m. near Hammer Hill Sports Ground near the Wong Tai Sin district in Kowloon, home to many public housing estates where many protesters in the group live.\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nWong Tai Sin used to be a stronghold of Beijing-aligned political parties, such as the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong.\n\nHowever, multiple reports of the heavy-handed tactics of the Hong Kong police against the protesters this summer have turned many people in the district against the police and Beijing, and toward the protesters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone of them were willing to identify themselves. Bob*, a 19-year-old nursing student, joked: \"China calls us 'rioters.' That is what you can call us.\" He is wearing a helmet saying \"Keep calm and march on\" topped with a yellow umbrella \u2014 the symbol of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement.\n\nMarc Fernandes\n\nBob, like many protesters, has a specific job.\n\nHe is a \"frontliner\" \u2014 someone who comes face-to-face with police \u2014 and his role is to snuff out tear gas canisters by stuffing them into an watertight bag filled with wet towels.\n\n*Bob is not this protester's real name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur route to the protest site didn't appear well planned, however. At 2:35 p.m. they were hiding on top of an overpass near Choi Hung Estate, a public housing complex, trying to figure out where to find other protesters.", "description": "October 1, 2019, marked one of the most violent days of the Hong Kong protests against mainland Chinese rule, which has raged into its 17th week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o.74e1SFOCmuhh_lsnYXYA--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/9ebc7c3e131a0aadd7d6d080889cdf4c"}
