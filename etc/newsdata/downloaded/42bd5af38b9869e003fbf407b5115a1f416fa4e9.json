It was some of the most harrowingly emotional scenes I've ever done.\"\n\nPraising her co-stars, the actress welled up before confirming an exit of sorts would be on the horizon for Faith in the fallout.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"[They're] very special, and I care about them a lot. It might be the case that Faith has to go away.\"\n\nIt's thought the big October scenes could see the truth come out, with this being when Moira and Nate are exposed.\n\nWhat exactly goes down, and who Nate really is, will be held top secret until closer to the time - so viewers should stay tuned.\n\nEmmerdale airs weeknights at 7pm on ITV, with an extra episode airing on Thursdays at 8pm.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Emmerdale actress Sally Dexter has confirmed Nate Robinson's real identity will be exposed with 'consequences' for those around him", "authors": ["Rose Hill", "Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Itv", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20156919.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/5_10_coro_pete_moira_nate_2nd_ep_02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
