(Submitted by Franca Collia)\n\nIn Swoop's case, the CTA launched an investigation following 50 passenger complaints to the agency concerning flight cancellations in early July, destined for or flying out of Hamilton. The airline cancelled 30 flights in the first 10 days that month, many of them involving a Hamilton route.\n\nSwoop, an ultra low-cost carrier owned by WestJet, wrote in an email that it's \"fully co-operating\" with the investigation.\n\nIn July, the airline said it cancelled the flights due to unscheduled aircraft maintenance. The move immediately sparked complaints from passengers who said they got short notice and unacceptable alternative flight offers.\n\n\"Very, very poor experience,\" said Radek Romanowski, who got his cancellation notice the evening before his July 8 return flight from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to Hamilton. A second email that night informed him that he was rebooked to fly on July 15 \u2014 one week later.\n\nRomanowski tried to contact Swoop, but the airline's call centre was closed because it was Sunday. Desperate to get home, his wife cashed in more than 22,000 Aeroplan reward miles to book him on an Air Canada flight the next day.\n\n\"It's not acceptable,\" said Romanowski, who lives in Komoka, Ont.\n\nWhen Radek Romanowki's Swoop flight was cancelled, his wife, Hanna, spent more than 22,000 Aeroplan reward miles to quickly get him back home to Komoka, Ont. (Submitted by Hanna Romanowki)\n\nLate last month, Romanowski was pleased to get an email inquiry from the CTA, asking him questions about his Swoop experience as part of its investigation. He hopes it will lead to the airline changing the way it handles flight cancellations.\n\n\"I'm hoping that in the future, they will do this in a proper way, communicate with the people and respect them,\" he said.\n\nKevin and Brenda Blenkhorn, of Fort Saskatchewan, Alta., flew on Swoop to attend a golf tournament in Ontario. They found out at the airport that their return flight was cancelled. (Submitted by Kevin Blenkhorn)\n\nPassenger Kevin Blenkhorn said he hopes the investigation will force Swoop to compensate him for spending $1,462 to rebook seats for himself and his wife with WestJet. He found out his Swoop flight home to Edmonton was cancelled when he and his wife, Brenda, showed up at the Hamilton airport on July 7 to check in.\n\nThe airline rebooked them on a flight that departed six days later.\n\nDetermined to get home sooner, Blenkhorn bought two tickets with WestJet \u2014 Swoop's owner. He said a Swoop employee at the airport told him to submit his receipts and he should be compensated.\n\nNine weeks later, Blenkhorn is still waiting, despite having contacted Swoop several times.\n\n\"They don't even respond,\" he said. \"You're expecting that they're going to keep their word, but obviously that's not the case.\"\n\nWill things change?\n\nLast year, Sunwing faced a CTA investigation after passengers travelling on 96 flights during a Toronto ice storm endured problems, including long flight and tarmac delays, missing baggage and a lack of communication from the airline.\n\nIn April, the CTA ruled that the airline violated conditions of its tariff, ordering Sunwing to compensate affected passengers and pay a $694,500 administrative fine.\n\nMoshe Lander, an economics professor at Montreal's Concordia University, said that the fines the CTA doles out for tariff violations are generally too low to affect any real change.\n\n\"A $700,000 fine sounds a lot to you and me; this is a miscellaneous expense to them,\" he said. \"So the penalty isn't proportionate enough to incentivize them to change their behaviour.\"\n\nAt this point, it's uncertain if Sunwing will even have to pay the penalty.\n\nThe airline has compensated affected passengers and said it has put measures in place to prevent a recurrence. But it's appealing the fine, arguing that the money goes to the CTA, an independent arm of the federal government.\n\n\"We take responsibility for the issues,\" Sunwing spokesperson Rachel Goldrick said in an email. \"What we are appealing are the administrative monetary penalties (AMPS) that are paid to the government and are not redistributed to our customers.\"\n\nRather than investigations and fines, Moshe said a better remedy is to allow more competition in the airline industry, which could force airlines to offer better service.\n\n\"There's a fundamental lack of competition in this marketplace,\" he said. \"That's really what's the underlying cause of these problems.\"", "description": "The Canadian Transportation Agency is investigating Air Transat and Swoop for possible mistreatment of passengers during recent flight disruptions.", "authors": ["Business Reporter", "Sophia Harris Has Worked As A Cbc Video Journalist Across The Country", "Covering Everything The Start Of The Annual Lobster Fishery In Yarmouth", "N.S.", "To Farming In Saskatchewan.
