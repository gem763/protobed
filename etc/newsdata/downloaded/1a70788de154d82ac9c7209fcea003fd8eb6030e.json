Crazy.\n\nOn the matter of why, she looked to decentralization, arguing that BTC is the first technology that allows one to become their own bank, \u201cas there is no higher authority\u201d or power controlling permissions and the flow of money.\n\nProminent Bitcoin commentator Beautyon has remarked that Phan\u2019s latest bout of support for Bitcoin is \u201chow normalization is done.\u201d Indeed, with so-called influencers literally changing how thousands of young people live their lives, the support of Bitcoin by an influencer with massive reach won\u2019t hurt.\n\nTHIS IS HOW NORMALISATION IS DONE. She believes that every entrepreneur should invest in Bitcoin. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the most important investment you can ever make in your life,\u201d she says, seriously and without hyperbole.https://t.co/ZfKbXi0YcR \u2014 Beautyon (@Beautyon_) October 2, 2019\n\nPhan isn\u2019t bluffing about her love for the orange coin that we\u2019ve come to love. She recently appeared on an episode of the \u201cOff The Pill\u201d podcast by Ryan Higa, a long-time Youtuber with some 20 million subscribers, to talk about Bitcoin and entrepreneurship. During that episode, she likened the asset to gold and made much ado about the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply cap of 21 million units.\n\nShe recently appeared on a later episode of Higa\u2019s podcast, in which the Youtube stars conversed with POTUS candidate Andrew Yang. Around halfway through the interview, Phan posed a question about cryptocurrency to Yang, who answered with optimism about this industry.\n\nRelated Reading: Bakkt First Week Volume Comparable to 4 Minutes Of Bitcoin Trading On Other Exchanges\n\nNot The Only Celeb in Crypto\n\nPhan is far from the only celebrity dabbling in cryptocurrency.\n\nPer previous reports from NewsBTC, speaking to The Breakfast Club, a massive radio/online show listened to by millions, artist/rapper Akon argued that \u201ccryptocurrencies are actually much more stable than fiat money\u201d.\n\nAs he explains, unlike government-issued fiat money, Bitcoin is \u201cultimately more controlled by the people\u201d than the dollar, having a decentralized verification model and a transparent issuance/inflation schedule.\n\nOn the sports side of things, Tony Hawk, a legendary skater, claimed earlier this year to have been HODLing BTC for years. Responding to a chart that accentuated the parabolic nature of Bitcoin\u2019s chart, which then resembled a skate ramp, Hawk quipped, in fact, that he\u2019s been \u201criding\u201d the cryptocurrency for \u201csix years\u201d, adding that he has yet to cash out of his position.\n\nAkon, Hawk, and Phan are just the tip of the iceberg, however; today there are known to be dozens of celebrities worth millions each that have financial stakes in Bitcoin, citing its upside potential and ability to revolutionize/usurp the modern fiat system that is in use today.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "While readers might not have heard of Michelle Phan, Bitcoin adoption may be dramatically boosted by this one social media star.
