It could eventually have a social impact on the size and types of property that could be developed,\" he said.\n\nThat future may not be far off, with some homes in places like Bangkok and Singapore - where a plethora of street food and online eateries exist - already being built with shared or only partial kitchen facilities.\n\nTo ensure local businesses do not lose out however, cities like London are taking steps to invest in and protect high streets, such as public campaigns to fill empty shops.\n\nCONVENIENCE AND SPEED\n\nBridget Outtrim, a director in the industrial team of real estate agent Savills, sees dark kitchens as part of the evolution of online parcel delivery services and the general gig economy, where convenience and speed are key.\n\nBut far from contributing to the death of the high street, Ms Outtrim said such sites could help \"fill gaps\" in the reach of restaurant chains by giving them the chance to sell their food in areas where they cannot or do not want to rent a space.\n\n\"(Dark kitchens) are a way of expanding into locations without making that massive property commitment,\" she said.\n\nDark kitchens are far cheaper to lease, said restaurant property expert David Rawlinson, who has scouted properties for Michelin-starred restaurants across London.\n\nRent on a communal kitchen in the city averages 25 pounds (about S$41) per square foot, while restaurants in central areas such as Soho and Mayfair go for up to eight times as much, he said.\n\nThat makes dark kitchens an affordable way for businesses to trial new foods and areas, he said.\n\nBut the shared kitchens model can have a downside, noted Mr Rawlinson, with the properties often needing additional space for delivery bikes and car bays, and the system may not be suitable for all food types.\n\nIn London, Ms Newton's communal kitchen business is thriving, she said, with six new sites planned across the capital in the next 24 months serving thousands of residents.\n\n\"We're creating a whole new ecosystem,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not the death of the chef or the death of restaurants, and people shouldn't be scared.\"\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Real Estate - [LONDON] When Eccie Newton and her sister began making fresh salads and sandwiches to deliver to London office workers, their start-up company Karma Cans became so popular they soon had to expand - and hit a common roadblock: space. .
