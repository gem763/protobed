England will experience the most growth in the UK\n\nThe UK population will top 70million by 2031, new figures state. Pictured: Oxford Street\n\nBut the ONS said the UK population growth rate is slower than in the projections made in 2016 with the expected population anticipated to be 0.4 million less in mid-2028 and 0.9 million less in mid-2043.\n\nThere is expected to be a growing number of older people with the proportion aged 85 years and over projected to almost double over the next 25 years.\n\nEngland will experience greater population growth than Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.\n\nIts population is set to grow five per cent between mid 2018 and mid 2028, compared with 3.7 per cent in Northern Ireland, 1.8 per cent in Scotland and 0.6 per cent in Wales.\n\nMigration will cause the majority of the growth from this year until 2043 as births and deaths reach similar levels.\n\nFindings suggest that 5.4million people will come to the UK over the next 10 years. with 3.3million people will emigrate long term from Britain.\n\nThe demographic that will experience the most growth will be people of working age, with a decline hitting children by 2028.\n\nThis projection is based on an assumption women will have fewer children, which reflects the fertility rate plunging to an 80-year low.\n\nBy mid 2043, the number of people of pensionable age is set to hit 3.6 million - a rise of 30 per cent.\n\nPictured: The statistics reveal the England will experience the greatest growth in population according to figures from the ONS\n\nPictured: This graph shows how the levelling out of births with deaths mean that migration will be the biggest cause of population growth\n\nA spokesman for the ONS said: 'The UK population is projected to grow by three million people by 2028.\n\n'This assumes migration will have a greater impact on the size of the population than the combination of births and deaths.\n\n'Although migration declines at first and the number of births is stable, the number of deaths is projected to grow as those born in the baby boom after World War Two reach older ages.\n\n'The population is increasingly ageing and this trend will continue. However, because of the expected rise in the state pension age to 67 years, it is projected that slightly fewer than one in five people will be of pensionable age in 2028, a similar proportion to today.'", "description": "As the number of births and deaths across the UK reach similar levels in the coming years, migration will be the chief driving force of the population rise, with England set for a five per cent surge.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett For Mailonline", "Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/09/19982484-0-image-a-14_1571648108930.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
