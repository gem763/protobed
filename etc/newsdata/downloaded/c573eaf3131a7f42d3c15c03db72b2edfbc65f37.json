But, though Liverpool were three points clear at the top, they played as though the goalless draw they eventually achieved was an acceptable result. In the event, Manchester City pipped them to the title by a point, and though that required a phenomenal run of 14 straight wins, had Liverpool embraced the pressure and played with their usual intensity in that game they would now be champions of England, not into their 30th season without a league title. On Sunday, Liverpool will arrive able to wear and excuse any slip-up: they are eight points clear at the top, while United, who are not quite as abhorrently awful as they\u2019ve looked recently, will have some key players back from injury and should be up for the fight. Even so, Liverpool would be foolish to entertain those thoughts. They have one foot on City\u2019s throat and the other aimed at United\u2019s solar plexus; allowing them to escape instead of kicking them when they\u2019re down would be a significant oversight with potentially significant repercussions. Playing safe is not always the safe option.

Having shipped a combined 10 goals in two games against Bayern and Brighton, Tottenham are unlikely to approach this game with confidence, but the international break will at least have provided the majority of their players with a change of scenery in which to try to rid themselves of the ennui permeating their Enfield training HQ. Despite reports that he was distinctly unimpressed with summer transfer dealings, Mauricio Pochettino has said he does not expect any January signings because \u201cI believe in the players we have\u201d. All available evidence suggests his players currently have little or no belief in themselves. A home defeat would likely prompt fury in the stands, albeit among a fanbase who seem as yet undecided in whose direction exactly their ire should be aimed.

The situation is that critical for the Portuguese, following four straight league defeats which has put his side in the relegation zone before Saturday\u2019s game. The omens are not good either. Two years ago, Ronald Koeman was sacked after Everton lost to a team from London in October; Arsenal were the visitors, 5-2 the final score, and given Everton\u2019s defensive travails right now \u2013 particularly at set pieces \u2013 who is to say they will not concede as many this weekend? Silva needs to tighten up his side and change it. The 4-2-3-1 formation he stubbornly sticks to is not working while certain players, most notably Gylfi Sigurdsson, have been performing poorly for some time. What\u2019s for sure is that a failure to improve and adapt will cost Silva and, if he\u2019s not careful, could do so very soon.

Manchester City, on the other hand, have not looked as vulnerable in quite some time, and Roy Hodgson will seek to exploit that. Most likely, he will ask Wilfried Zaha and Jordan Ayew to rove in the spaces between City\u2019s full-backs and centre-backs \u2013 such as there are \u2013 and, if their teammates can get them the ball, Palace are in the game. Pep Guardiola clearly doesn\u2019t fancy John Stones \u2013 and with fair reason \u2013 but he must now rely on him, while Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi remains a liability. However \u2013 and it really is an enormous however \u2013 Stones\u2019s return from injury means Fernandinho is no longer required at the back, and with Kevin De Bruyne also fit again, City have a full complement of midfielders. Hodgson cannot simply plan his team\u2019s route to goal but must somehow fathom how they avoid being taken apart. One job is significantly easier than the other.

For instance, Jamie Vardy\u2019s five goals have come from seven shots on target, while the four Ricardo Pereira and Wilfred Ndidi have scored between them have come from four shots on target. So a drop off is coming. There was the loss at Liverpool before the international break and now a game against a Burnley side whose own decent start has gone under the radar somewhat. Sean Dyche\u2019s side are seventh, having won two of their past three games and lost only once away from home. They won\u2019t be pushovers at the King Power and could stifle a Leicester side who, if the stats are anything to go by, are playing at a level that is remarkable in more ways than one. SN\n\n\u2022 Leicester v Burnley (3pm, Saturday)\n\n6) Brighton must build on lightbulb moment\n\nBrighton have never won at Villa Park, but will fancy their chances of breaking that duck at the 12th time of asking. Graham Potter\u2019s side went into the international break on the back of a 3-0 dismantling of Tottenham that had all the hallmarks of a lightbulb moment; a game in which their players put into practice to devastating effect the possession-based philosophy their erudite manager has been preaching. With a run of winnable games against Villa, Everton, Norwich and Manchester United to come, they must show their performance against Spurs was no one-off. But, following the slaughter they visited upon Norwich at Carrow Road, Villa should provide a stern test.

Photograph: Jane Stokes/ProSports/Rex/Shutterstock\n\n7) Hudson-Odoi can be the key for Chelsea\n\nAfter difficult starts to the season, neither manager will have welcomed the international break. Frank Lampard had Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea playing with freedom and zest, while Steve Bruce had finally copied Rafael Ben\u00edtez, thereby restoring Newcastle\u2019s discipline and intensity. However, it is not hard to predict the flow of this game: Newcastle will invite Chelsea on to them and hope to nick a goal, while Chelsea will look to pick holes in their back line, making the match an interesting test for Callum Hudson-Odoi. Lots of wingers are adept at running in behind, but the better the team they play for the less opportunity they have to do it, because opposing defences tend to occupy that space. What counts is the ability to pinch a yard from a standing start, pick clever passes that change the angle of attack, and sneak poacher\u2019s goals at the back post. If Hudson-Odoi can marry these attributes to his preternatural skill, balance and composure, Chelsea have a star on their hands.

Victory over Sheffield United combined with City\u2019s failure to win at Palace on Saturday would secure that outcome and leave Unai Emery no doubt feeling satisfied. But while Arsenal\u2019s results have been good, the majority of their performances have not and should they be unconvincing again at Bramall Lane, regardless of the result, it will leave a question mark hanging over the Spaniard\u2019s long-term credentials. Right now Emery seems like a man unsure whether to stick to his conservative principles or twist and let his team\u2019s attacking riches flourish. A shift to something more decisive, and specifically to the latter, could be the thing that shows he knows what he is doing.

While not being Mark Hughes is a tick on the credit side of the Austrian\u2019s ledger, it will only get him so far. His team have lost three consecutive Premier League matches against middling-to-decent opposition and failed to beat anyone of major significance since Spurs at the beginning of March. Hasenh\u00fcttl claims not having too many of his players away on international duty has benefited his team. \u201cIt gave me the chance to work on a few weaknesses in our game that we have seen in our last two games,\u201d he announced. With his team averaging less than a point a game and tough assignments to come against Leicester and Manchester City next, his players urgently need to show they have taken his pointers on board.

But subsequent to it, Norwich were beaten by Burnley and Crystal Palace, then walloped by Aston Villa. Now sitting second-bottom, they need points as a matter of urgency. In a way, Bournemouth are ideal next opponents: their desire to play will permit Norwich to do likewise, but wins over Everton and Southampton followed by a creditable defeat at Arsenal show the Cherries are also in form. Their front four of Harry Wilson, Callum Wilson, Dominic Solanke and Josh King pose a stern threat to any defence, but the power and intelligence of their press mean Norwich must take more care than most. Playing out from the back against City\u2019s diminutive technicians is one thing, but \u2013 however silly this may sound \u00ad\u2013 doing likewise against Bournemouth is something else entirely.
