Will it be enough to turn the Jazz into an NBA championship contender?\n\nThat\u2019s what Utah is banking on heading into the 2019-20 season. Conley joins rising star Donovan Mitchell to form what could be one of the league\u2019s more potent backcourt duos in the season ahead.\n\nMitchell averaged 23.8 points and 4.2 assists in his second season, but struggled at times with his scoring efficiency. Conley promises to relieve some of the playmaking burden that Mitchell felt at times as an NBA sophomore.\n\n\u201cMike Conley is an elite point guard,\u201d Quin Snyder said at the team\u2019s media day on Monday. \u201cWhen I say elite that manifests in a lot of different ways. Certainly on the court, some of the things he does and the feel he has for the game and for players around him is really unique. He impacts the game.\u201d\n\nConley is one of the league\u2019s most efficient point guards in the pick-and-roll and a reliable shooter. He scored a career-best 21.1 points per game in his final season in Memphis while also averaging 6.4 assists per game.\n\nMitchell anticipates seeing Utah\u2019s offense open up thanks to Conley\u2019s patience and court vision.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a guy who goes at his own pace and that\u2019s one of the things I\u2019m really starting to learn,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIt\u2019s not really always about getting in there and scoring. He\u2019s creating and finding guys who are open.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Conley is savoring the potential of joining Mitchell in the backcourt and playing with a talent-laden roster that also includes two time NBA Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert.\n\n\u201cWe have a team, with our depth and guys who play both sides of the ball, that allows us to get into a lot of different schemes that the other team might not be able to do, which is exciting,\u201d Conley said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting when you have that versatility.\u201d\n\nOther things to know about the Utah Jazz heading into the 2019-20 season:\n\nINTERNATIONAL FLAVOR:\n\nSix of the 20 players on Utah\u2019s training camp roster come from outside the United States. Two of those players, Gobert (France) and Joe Ingles (Australia), played key roles in driving their national teams to success in the 2019 FIBA World Cup.\n\nGobert credits the NBA with making big strides in growing the game globally with the influx of international players playing for the Jazz and other teams in the league. The league plans to broadcast multiple games during prime time in Europe this season, including three Utah games.\n\n\u201cTwenty years ago, it was harder for those kids to think they were going to be NBA players,\u201d Gobert said. \u201cNow, anywhere in the world, you can have that goal and I think it\u2019s great for the game.\u201d\n\nVETERAN PRESENCE\n\nThe Jazz signed multiple veteran free agents to help boost their offense and defense during the offseason. Bojan Bogdanovic was the highest profile free agent to join Utah, signing a four-year, $73.1 million deal in July. Bogdanovic averaged a career-best 18.0 points for Indiana last season and shot 42.5% from 3-point range.\n\nUtah also added Jeff Green, Ed Davis, and Emmanuel Mudiay on shorter deals in July. Davis gives the Jazz a defensive specialist who can spell Gobert in the middle when needed. Green adds additional scoring punch on the wing.\n\n\u201cWe have it all on paper,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe have to translate it on court when the season starts.\u201d\n\nHEALTHY AGAIN\n\nMitchell was limited in his offseason training last summer when he suffered a foot injury at the end of his rookie season. The third-year guard had no such issues this summer, playing for Team USA in the 2019 FIBA World Cup and getting plenty of time in the gym to workout with teammates like Conley and Royce O\u2019 Neale.\n\n\u201cI could go to the gym whenever I wanted to shoot,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things you really miss when you get hurt.\u201d\n\nPROVING GROUND\n\nGreen signed a one-year deal with the Jazz in July - his fourth consecutive year on a one-year contract. He is with his sixth team in five seasons after posting 12.3 points per game on 47.5% shooting for Washington last season. Utah views him as a potential starter or sixth man.\n\nFor Green, joining Utah is equally about playing for a championship contender and proving his value to the rest of the league.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never satisfied,\u201d Green said. \u201cI think when you are, that\u2019s when you have an early exit.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Utah changed the entire dynamic of its backcourt after acquiring veteran point guard Mike Conley from the Memphis Grizzlies in July.
