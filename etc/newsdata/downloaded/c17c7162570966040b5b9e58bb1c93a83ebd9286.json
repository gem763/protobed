Bernie Sanders while speaking to Business Insider on Thursday.\n\nHis comments followed an appearance on Fox Business on Wednesday, in which he called the Democratic presidential candidate a \"blowhard\" for arguing that billionaires shouldn't exist in the United States.\n\nSanders has long criticized growing inequality in the United States and called for higher taxes on the wealthy and large corporations. And, according to Forbes, Langone is worth an estimated $3.9 billion. He has also long been considered a Republican megadonor.\n\nBut the venture capitalist, whose firm Invemed helped bankroll Home Depot in 1978, says that he has created jobs and improved lives while accruing his fortune.\n\n\"Forget how much money I made,\" Langone told Business Insider. He said that by helping to found Home Depot, Langone ensured that \"more than 500,000 people\" have been \"gainfully employed, providing for their families, enjoying life, educating their kids\" throughout the years.\n\n\"Mr. Langone isn't speaking on behalf of the company and retired from The Home Depot's Board of Directors more than a decade ago,\" a Home Depot spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\n\"Bernie, tell me what you did?\" Langone said. \"You're the big authority. You know this problem, you know that problem. Help me out, Bernie, show me that what you did worked.\"\n\nOn Fox Business, Langone repeated his claim that 3,000 entry-level Home Depot employees have gone on to become multi-millionaires. He told Business Insider that these employees were able to achieve this success after working at the company for \"a number of years.\"\n\n\"I'm not saying they were hired yesterday,\" Langone said. \"It takes a period of time \u2014 and don't forget, in the meantime, they're building their estates, they're being paid and they're paying their bills and they're feeding their families.\"\n\nSanders' campaign website centers the 2020 presidential candidate's job creation plan around infrastructure jobs, small businesses, and youth employment. Speaking to Business Insider, Langone characterized the field of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates as \"giving away the world.\"\n\nRead more: The billionaire cofounder of Home Depot plans on donating up to 90% of his $5.9 billion fortune, and Trump's 2020 campaign will be one of the beneficiaries\n\nThis isn't the first time that one of Home Depot's original movers and shakers has sowed political controversy. Cofounder Bernie Marcus sparked an online backlash when he recently told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he planned to donate to President Donald Trump's 2020 reelection bid. Marcus is another outspoken conservative figure, appearing once on Fox News to argue that Democratic politicians \"don't have any brains\" for failing to support Trump's tax plan.\n\nWhen asked about how he would respond to objections that, as a billionaire, his criticism of Sanders is self-serving, Langone cited his $300 million donation to scholarship students at New York University and the 38 students on scholarship he is funding at Bucknell University.\n\nHe went on to say that he won't apologize \"for winning by playing by the rules.\"\n\n\"I pay my taxes,\" he said. \"We honor all of the regulations that are enforced that we have to live with \u2014 even though I think some of them are foolish, we still honor them. We provide our employees with a great work environment and career path opportunities. Anytime somebody wants to criticize me, that's their right. I'm only going to ask them, tell me what you've done, show me what you've done for somebody else.\"", "description": "Ken Langone helped bankroll Home Depot when it launched in 1978.
