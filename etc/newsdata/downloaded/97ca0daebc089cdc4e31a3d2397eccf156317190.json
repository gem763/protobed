Chairman Lars Idermark quit shortly after. Ms. Bonnesen declined to comment.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nSwedbank last month said banking and financial industry veteran Jens Henriksson would take over as chief executive.\n\nSwedbank also said Tuesday that it submitted answers to questions it received from the Financial Supervisory Authorities in Sweden and Estonia, as a result of ongoing investigations of the bank. The bank\u2019s board of directors also decided to waive a legal privilege protecting work done by a lawyer on behalf of the bank, Swedbank said.\n\nThe Swedish lender said that its anti-money-laundering work still has certain shortcomings and that it is working to ensure regulatory compliance going forward.\n\n\u201cSwedbank has continuously improved its system support, processes and routines,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThe bank has also terminated relations with clients who do not meet regulatory requirements or the bank\u2019s policy.\u201d\n\nSwedbank said that, in the past, it didn\u2019t allocate sufficient resources to manage the risk of money laundering by clients and third parties.\n\n\u201cThe division of responsibilities within the bank has not been clear enough, and the bank has not always complied with internal policies,\u201d the company said, citing shortcomings in know-your-customer and risk assessments in its Swedish and Estonian operations.\n\nIn February, Swedbank commissioned the law firm Clifford Chance to conduct an internal investigation into the bank\u2019s historical shortcomings, which is expected to be completed in early 2020.\n\nThe bank said that as well as serving as its chief compliance officer, Ms. Harbo will continue to be co-opted to the group executive committee.\n\n\u2014Kristin Broughton and Dylan Tokar contributed to this article.", "description": "Swedbank said it has appointed Ingrid Harbo as permanent chief compliance officer, as investigations into its anti-money-laundering work continue.", "authors": ["Oliver Griffin", "Oliver.Griffin Dowjones.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107945/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
