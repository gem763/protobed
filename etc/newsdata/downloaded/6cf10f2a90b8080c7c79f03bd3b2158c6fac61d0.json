A devastated Katheryn Strang made \u201cLOST DOG\u201d signs and took daily trips to the local shelter for months, desperate to find her.\n\nOn Friday, Strang finally got the reunion she had been hoping for \u2014 12 years after Dutchess disappeared. A man found the long-lost dog under his shed in the Pittsburgh area, almost 1,000 miles from Orlando. He took the shivering animal to a shelter, Humane Animal Rescue. There, a scan of Dutchess\u2019s microchip linked her to Strang, who had since moved to Boca Raton.\n\nAt the shelter on Friday, Strang cried as an employee handed her the dog she had always hoped would one day return to her. Staff members posted footage of the emotional reunion on Facebook, writing, \u201cThis is why we do what we do.\u201d\n\n\u201cDutchess. Hi, baby. I missed you,\" Strang says in the video as she strokes the dog\u2019s face. \"Your face is all white.\u201d\n\n\n\nKatheryn Strang is reunited with Dutchess, her toy fox terrier, at Humane Animal Rescue in Pittsburgh on Oct. 11. (Steve Mellon/Pittsburgh Post-Gazette via AP)\n\nNo one knows how Dutchess made the trek to Pittsburgh \u2014 or what she has been doing for the past 12 years. Strang joked that the dog could \u201ctell me some stories.\u201d She said she couldn\u2019t imagine that Dutchess had walked the whole way.\n\nThe dog, who is now 14, was hungry, shaking and \u201cin serious need of a nail trim\u201d when she arrived at the shelter, said Torin Fisher, an admissions counselor with Humane Animal Rescue. She was also \u201ca little nervous about the situation, which, who could blame her?\u201d Fisher said. But otherwise, Dutchess was in pretty good shape.\n\nShelter employees soon found the microchip -- an implanted device that contains a unique number that can be traced back to an animal\u2019s owner. Seeing that Dutchess\u2019s owner lived in Florida, Fisher figured the family must have recently moved to Pittsburgh. Only when she called Strang did she learn \u201chow incredible of a situation it actually was.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole story kind of unfolded while we were on the phone,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cAnd we were equally excited and shocked and surprised.\u201d\n\nStrang had always held out hope that Dutchess might be found, even after so many years. She paid a $15 annual fee to keep the microchip active, saying on Friday that she would have kept doing it for years.\n\nStill, she was in disbelief as she made the long drive to Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cUntil she\u2019s in your arms, it\u2019s just gut wrenching,\u201d she said.\n\nRead more:\n\nA puppy trapped by Hurricane Dorian was found alive a month later\n\nA woman posted videos of herself hopping a fence to approach a zoo lion.
