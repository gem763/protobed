The economic data were OK. Sentiment had been poor: Bears greatly outperformed bulls again in the AAII Survey [for the 5th week]; Citigroup panic/euphoria model was close to panic; low-volatility funds vastly outperformed SP500 over the last 6 months [12.5% vs 6.3%]. So, the news that the US-China talks will restart in October moved the market up and out of its trading range [between 200-dMA and 50-dMA].\n\nEuropean EASA [counterpart to the US FAA] will make its determination of Boeing 737 MAX safety and may require additional pilot training. These new planes were grounded after 2 accidents that may have been caused by its MCAS anti-stall system and AOA sensors.\n\nLow rates make corporate pension plan underfunding worse [as the present value of future obligation increases]. But a closer look shows that the problem is limited to only a few sectors. Older companies in industrial and consumer-discretionary sectors have more than half of the total corporate pension obligations. Most underfunding is in energy, industrial, materials sectors.\n\n[The CME FedWatch tool, based on current fed fund futures quotes, shows the following probabilities for 2019:\n\nFor 2nd hike [cut], 0% for hike [91.2% for cut] at FOMC 9/18/19;\n\nFor 3rd hike [cut],\n\n0% for hike [58.5% for cut] at FOMC 10/30/19;\n\n0% for hike [80.0% for cut] at FOMC 12/11/19;\n\nhttp://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html ]\n\nFor the week [index changes only], DJIA +1.49%, SP500 +1.79%, Nasdaq Comp +1.76%, Russell 2000 +0.69%. DJ Transports +1.74%; DJ Utilities +0.33%. US$ -0.51%, oil/WTI +2.58%, gold -0.85%.\n\nYTD [index changes only], DJIA +14.88%, SP500 +18.82%, Nasdaq Comp +22.12%.\n\nPg M6, Europe: UK infrastructure company Balfour Beatty [BBY.uk/BAFYY; fwd P/E 9.4] is attractive. It also runs the US military housing business that is being valued at zero due to some operational scandals. It is in a cyclical industry and is hurt by global slowdown and Brexit concerns.\n\nPg M6, Emerging Markets: Will IMF rescue/bailout of Argentina that started in 2018 continue? Likely. A lot has happened \u2013 weak primary showing by President Macri; attempts to reprofile/restructure debt; currency controls. The leading Presidential candidate Fernandez is making anti-IMF noises \u2013 but he may change his tune after he wins.\n\nPg M11, Commodities: Spread between oil/Brent and oil/WTI is the narrowest since July 2018. That indicates pipeline capacity growth; higher US refining volumes; better balance between oil supply and demand. The US-China trade war is not a factor \u2013 that would have led to widening of this spread.\n\nPg M7, Options: Selling puts on blue-chips that one is willing to own/add is recommended for some extra income. [If the price falls, the put-seller may be obligated to buy (on random assignment) and the broker typically blocks/reserves necessary funds for that]\n\n[SP500 VIX 15.00, SKEW 118.87] [10-Yr TYVIX 4.80[Yahoo Finance data]\n\nPg M23, M28: A good week in Europe [Finland +2.99%, Belgium -0.04%, Greece -0.13%] and a good week in Asia [New Zealand +4.56%, India -0.70%]. The equity CEF index [data to Thursday] outperformed the DJIA and its discount was -6%.\n\nTreasury rates 3-mo yield 1.96%, 2-yr 1.53%, 5-yr 1.42%, 10-yr 1.55%, 30-yr 2.02% [Treasury data*]. Dollar rose, DXY 98.39, -0.4% [M31]. Gold fell to $1,524, -0.3% [notable deviation again from pg M3]; the gold-miners rose [M38]. [^XAU was at 94.26, -4.77% for the week]\n\n*Treasury Yield-Curve https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=y...\n\nTop FDIC insured savings deposit rates*: Money-market accounts 2.37%; 1-yr CDs 2.37%; 5-yr CDs 2.76% [M29].\n\n*For local rates https://www.depositaccounts.com/banks/rates-map/\n\nPg 18: Cover Story, \u201cHow to Fix the Global Retirement Crisis\u201d. Aging is a global issue and countries are addressing it in different ways. Globally, 9% of the population is 65+ [28% in Japan] and it will be 16% by 2050. In Japan, older people are working longer \u2013 not just for money but for social engagement. Australia encourages people to save more for retirement; it also has mandatory and fully employer-funded pension system [superannuation accounts] that provide basic means-tested retirement income. Sweden has universal long-term care [LTC]. China requires [2013- ] children to regularly visit their aging parents. Several countries have programs similar to the US Social Security.\n\nPg 23: Italy spends 16% of its GDP on pension benefits. Italian public debt is high at 130% of GDP. Population is aging rapidly. Retirees have been hurt by Italy\u2019s fiscal issue and by EU-Italy tensions. Pension benefits are changed every time the government changes [which is quite often].\n\nPg 7, Up & Down Wall Street: Stocks rose on the news of US-China talks in October. Stocks have been yielding more than 10-yr Treasuries; SP500 fwd P/E of 18 translates into earnings yield of 5.5% [but you don\u2019t get to pocket that].\n\nProspects of money-losing WeWork/WeCo IPO are poor \u2013 it may reduce its IPO valuation or may postpone it. It may be better to invest in 2 office REITs [SLG, VNO] that are active in weak NYC market.\n\nEuropean stocks [fwd P/E 14; heavy in financials, cyclicals] have lagged the US stocks [heavy in growth techs] for several years. European dividend yields are higher.\n\nValue perked up last week but there are not many value investors around anymore. A value play is in investment management firms BEN, PZN.\n\nPg 11, Streetwise: Athleisure \u2013 athletic wear in casual and/or work settings \u2013 may be more than a fad. It is benefitting LULU, NKE, VFC. There are new clothing and shoes with breathable materials. Consumers are going for brand names rather than generic styles.\n\nIs there a stock bubble in the US? Top 5 [MSFT, AAPL, AMAN, GOOGL, FB] trade at high but not ludicrous valuations. But sector earnings may be another matter. Almost 28% of the earnings of all US stocks are now from tech and e-commerce. That share may continue to grow some more but may be vulnerable to public and government backlash against disruptive tech, regulations, breakup threats. Compare that with the top of the housing bubble when 29% of all earnings were from financials, and the top of the dot.com bubble when 25% of all earnings were from tech.\n\nMore later\u2026.\n\nYBB", "description": "[ Italics-bold within the brackets are my additions/elaborations ] [ New M* Discussions doesn\u2019t allow any colors for cut-and-paste from WORD ] MW - 21466", "authors": ["Contributor"], "top_image": "https://zwcdr85544.i.lithium.com/html/assets/favicon.ico?15D4DC4041FDD3CD56F6121736C9C68D", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
