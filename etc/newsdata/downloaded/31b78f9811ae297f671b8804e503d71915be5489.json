See Madonna\n\nThe Queen of Pop goes to Brooklyn.\n\nMadonna first made her name in New York City, singing and dancing at the bygone Garment District nightclub Danceteria in the early \u201980s, so it makes sense that she would celebrate her latest album, Madame X, which looks back on her history as a pop royal and provocateur, in the city where it all began. Her Madame X tour kicks off with a monthlong residency at Brooklyn Academy of Music; it\u2019ll be the longest you can count on the restless legend staying put. \u2014Craig Jenkins\n\nBAM, through October 12.\n\nBooks\n\n2. See Ta-Nehisi Coates\n\nConversations on race.\n\nTa-Nehisi Coates transformed how we talk about racial justice with his call for reparations; Nikole Hannah-Jones masterminded the New York Times Magazine\u2019s \u201c1619 Project,\u201d which reframes the history of our country. They celebrate the publication of Coates\u2019s first novel, the magic-realist slave-escape narrative The Water Dancer, with a likely mind-blowing conversation. \u2014Boris Kachka\n\nKings Theatre, 1027 Flatbush Avenue, Flatbush, September 24.\n\nTheater\n\n3. See Antigone\n\nOf gods and women.\n\nJapanese director Satoshi Miyagi fills the cavernous dream box of the Armory with a literal river \u2014 the symbolic heart of a new version of the ancient Greek story about a woman who defies the laws of man and honors the laws of heaven by burying her brother. Miyagi\u2019s sweeping production refracts the myth through the prisms of Buddhist philosophy, Noh theater, and Indonesian shadow puppetry. \u2014Sara Holdren\n\nPark Avenue Armory, September 25 to October 6.\n\nClassical Music/Festivals\n\n4. Go to Ecstatic Music\n\nAn opera about loss.\n\nThe annual new-music festival\u2019s tenth edition kicks off a bit lugubriously with The Hunger, Donnacha Dennehy\u2019s 2016 opera about Ireland\u2019s Great Famine, performed by the crack ensemble Alarm Will Sound. Music by the electroacoustic performer-composer Eartheater, remixed for the occasion, follows. \u2014Justin Davidson\n\nKaufman Music Center, 129 West 67th Street, September 19.\n\nArt\n\n5. See Sarah Sze\n\n\u201cIn the age of the image, a painting is a sculpture,\u201d she says.\n\nA MacArthur fellow and the 2013 Venice Biennale artist of the U.S.\n\nPavilion, Sarah Sze is one of this country\u2019s most eccentrically intriguing sculptors. Here, she brings her massive mind and busy hands to bear. Prepare for all manner of images, digital technologies, and probably thousands of other squirrelly materials. \u2014Jerry Saltz\n\nTanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, through October 19.\n\nBooks\n\n6. See Dan Kois\n\nAll in the family.\n\nSlate editor, parenting podcaster, and New York alum Dan Kois enacts both a fantasy and a gonzo experiment, dragging his wife and two preteen daughters on a yearlong exploration of parenting styles around the world. After settling in Costa Rica, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and small-town Kansas for months at a time, Kois winsomely compares and contrasts (spoiler alert: The Dutch aren\u2019t perfect) and, along the way, finds the meaning of quality time. He\u2019ll share his findings in Brooklyn with Sam Anderson, author of the excellent Oklahoma City history Boom Town. \u2014B.K.\n\nBooks Are Magic, 225 Smith Street, Cobble Hill, September 18.\n\nMovies\n\n7. See Nashville\n\nAn American epic.\n\nRobert Altman\u2019s panorama still dwarfs most contemporary movies. His scathing portrait of the world of country music might score easy points, but it remains the greatest metaphorical setting for the rot at the heart of a flag-waving, faux-godly culture. Laugh-In\u2019s Henry Gibson makes a chilling grand old fraudster, and the performances of Ronee Blakley, Keith Carradine, Lily Tomlin, and so many more remain emotionally on point. There will be a Q&A with screenwriter Joan Tewkesbury on September 21. \u2014 David Edelstein\n\nFilm Forum, September 20 to 26.\n\nArt\n\n8. See Shona McAndrew\n\nWomen as muses.\n\nAt this year\u2019s always-good Spring/Break Art Show, Shona McAndrew, 28, killed it with a life-size walk-in papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 sculpture of her bedroom, complete with her and her boyfriend naked in bed and her toying with his soft penis. It was an epic example of radical vulnerability, intimacy, and mastery. Prepare for more amped-up works in \u201cMuse,\u201d her first solo show in New York, curated by Maria Brito, at this excellent new gallery. \u2014J.S.\n\nChart Gallery, 74 Franklin Street, through November 2.\n\nTheater\n\n9. See Heroes of the Fourth Turning\n\nUs and them.\n\nA celebration quickly spirals into vicious existential chaos in a new play from Will Arbery (Plano), who imagines his way into the faiths and fears of four young conservatives at a late-night reunion in Wyoming. \u2014S.H.\n\nPlaywrights Horizons, through October 27.\n\nMovies\n\n10. See Midnight Traveler\n\n\u201cA journey to the edge of hell.\u201d\n\nA poignant family documentary with a pervasive chill and a precipice in view. Hassan Fazili\u2019s film chronicles his family\u2019s three-year flight from the resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan through Turkey, Bulgaria, and Serbia, and into Germany to wait in limbo for asylum. The cameraman? There are several: Hassan, his wife, and their two daughters, shooting the journey on their phones. \u2014D.E.\n\nFilm Forum, September 18 to October 1.\n\nTheater\n\n11. See Scotland, PA\n\nWhen the hurly-burly\u2019s fun.\n\nBased on Billy Morrissette\u2019s deliciously weird 2001 film adaptation of Macbeth, this dark new musical comedy sets Shakespeare\u2019s tale of murderous ambition in a sleepy Pennsylvania town where the local burger-joint manager and his wife have big dreams \u2014 and an increasing number of bodies on their hands. \u2014S.H.\n\nLaura Pels Theatre, through December 8.\n\nBuy tickets here.\n\nClassical Music\n\n12. Hear A Night of Women Composers\n\nAt last.\n\nThe classical-music world finally seems to have realized that women write music too. No epiphanies were required at this Williamsburg new-music incubator run by composer-impresario Paola Prestini, which kicks off its fifth season with Nico Muhly and Timo Andres performing music by many non-men. \u2014J.D.\n\nNational Sawdust, September 27.\n\nArt\n\n13. See Brazzers Backroom VHS\n\nPop-culture-centric art.\n\nThe THNK1994 Museum \u2014 the brilliant, deranged minds behind tongue-in-cheek art exhibits like \u201cThe Olsen Twins Hiding From the Paparazzi\u201d \u2014 are partnering with porn kingpins Brazzers for their latest event, which features artworks based on THNK1994-invented porn titles like The F*ckening and Doctor! All Our A*sholes are Possessed! and appearances by adult film stars.\n\n310 Canal Street, September 28 and 29.\n\nPop Music\n\n14. See Steve Miller Band and Jimmie Vaughan Band\n\nA night at the museum.\n\nThe Steve Miller Band and the Jimmie Vaughan Band are closing out the Met\u2019s \u201cPlay It Loud: Instruments of Rock & Roll\u201d exhibit with a bangin\u2019 concert, likely accompanied by some of rock\u2019s sexiest guitars. Maybe leave the leather pants at home, though, as your ticket includes admission to both the concert and the exhibit.\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, September 28.\n\n*A version of this article appears in the September 16, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
