I appreciate life so much now it\u2019s unbelievable.\n\n\u201cLots of people used to try to pick fights and I\u2019d be a divvy and fight back. Now I turn the other cheek.\n\n\u201cCall me what you want. All I want is peace and happiness.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate his restored health, Paddy has completed a string of e\u00adxtraordinary bucket-list activities to be televised early next year.\n\nLast month he travelled to Japan, where he spent three and a half weeks ticking off 14 challenges, including \u00adsamurai martial arts lessons, swimming with dolphins, hot air ballooning and \u00adcatching electric eels with his bare hands.\n\nThe star also visited a rice field and climbed a volcano as part of the amazing trip with presenter pal Dan Coll, 58, who has also been treated for prostate cancer.\n\nPaddy said: \u201cI\u2019m a bit of an adrenaline junkie. It gives me a rush to do scary stuff. And nothing could be worse than prostate cancer. Fear just goes away from you.\n\n\"I did crazy things that I never dreamed I would do when I was getting my treatment. It was a once-in-a-lifetime thing. Every day you were thinking, \u2018This is too good after being ill.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome challenges were so hair-raising he told his devoted wife Roseanne only moments before \u00addoing them for fear she would worry.\n\nThe couple, who are based at a caravan site in Queensferry, North Wales, have been wed for 40 years, had ten kids together and have 19 grandkids and one great-granddaughter.\n\nPaddy said: \u201cI called my lovely woman twice a day. She told me not to bungee jump so told her I wouldn\u2019t. Then on the day just before I called her and said sorry but I\u2019m gonna have to do it and hung up.\n\n\"She\u2019s saying, \u2018You\u2019re gonna give me a heart attack!\u2019 But I did it, I jumped 160 metres off a bridge and it was the most amazing thing.\u201d\n\nBut the biggest shock was his unexpected fanbase in Japan.\n\n\u201cThe way they treated me over there was a joke,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was so fantastic. Everyone \u00adrecognised me, I couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\n\u201cThey all knew me from Danny Dyer\u2019s Deadliest Men and Big Fat Gypsy Wedding. Honest to God, I\u2019m not \u00adbragging, it was thousands of people asking for selfies.\u201d\n\nBorn in Manchester to Irish \u00adparents, Paddy found notoriety when Danny interviewed him for his Bravo series about Britain\u2019s most feared men in 2009.\n\nHe went on to appear in Channel 4\u2019s hit show documenting the life of travellers. In 2011 he beat Kerry Katona to win Celebrity Big Brother .\n\nThe victory, he admits, still astonishes him. He said: \u201cI\u2019m a nobody. I never thought I\u2019d last in there. After a week I went to the diary room and said I\u2019ve had enough, I want to go back to my woman.\n\n\"They told me I couldn\u2019t because the public kept voting for me. And then I won. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I still can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe has appeared in a string of other reality shows but still has one on his personal bucket list to tick off.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love from the bottom of my heart to go into the jungle,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d have the biggest laugh. I was supposed to go on I\u2019m a Celeb twice but in the end they refused me. I think because I\u2019m a traveller, they said no.\u201d\n\nBut he hopes producers will reconsider after watching his new series Bucket List, which will air on new channel TravelXP in the new year.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThis series I felt like showing them this is what I can do. And the entertainment I brought was unbelievable.\u201d\n\nPaddy says he is riding high after being put in remission.\n\nAnd he is enjoying helping other men in the travelling community cope with the disease.\n\nThe star, who still has steroid medication and check-ups, said: \u201cI\u2019m so proud. Do you know how many travelling men say, \u2018Paddy Doherty I watched you on the \u00admorning breakfast show and I went and got myself tested.\u2019 I swear on my life I went to the pub last night and this lad I know said, \u2018I\u2019ve got what you had, prostate cancer.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe had such a good chat, and I took a lot of worry from him.\u201d\n\nPaddy has spoken candidly about how the pain of going for a wee while suffering symptoms of the illness left him in tears.\n\nHe told how he ignored the pain for months until he started passing blood and went for tests that \u00adconfirmed the disease.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nEventually the pain became so bad he considered \u00adsuicide twice. When steroid \u00adtreatment didn\u2019t work, he had surgery at Manchester Royal Infirmary to remove his prostate and fix the blood loss issue.\n\nWith the ordeal behind him today, and showing the humour that won him legions of fans, he joked: \u201cWhen I had my first wee after I was well I couldn\u2019t believe I was pain free. I was going to take a video and call it Free Willy.\n\n\u201cThose dark times are a long way in the past. I should have been dead a lot of times. I really believe God led me back from something. I\u2019ve been badly smashed up and a million bad times have happened. Thank God I\u2019m here now. Life can only get better.\n\n\u201cMoney can\u2019t buy you health. I\u2019ve won the lottery. What money can repair is not a problem but if it\u2019s something money can\u2019t repair, you got a problem.\u201d\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nHe credits his own loving family \u2013 many of whom live on the same caravan site \u2013 for supporting him and revealed their delight when he was put in remission.\n\n\u201cThey all couldn\u2019t stop kissing me and hugging me. My grandchildren are my whole world. Knowing I would have longer with them meant everything. I never knew if I\u2019d see them grow up and it was horrendous.\n\n\u201cWithout my wife I\u2019m not a man, I\u2019m nobody. The air I breathe is my wife. No matter who or what I am she keeps my feet on the ground. I\u2019m no good without her and she\u2019s no good without me.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding star has put his fighting days behind him and has had the time of his life filming a new TV show", "authors": ["Amy Sharpe", "Image", "Pa", "Channel"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20565935.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_IMG_8012.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
