He was also fined 10,000 Swiss francs ($10,000).\n\n\u201c(Aghazada) was aware of this abuse and had the duty to report and prevent it,\u201d FIFA said, adding that other soccer officials are still being investigated in the case.\n\nThe AFC said it \u201cwill wait until the decision is final and binding\u201d before acting to remove Aghazada from his position.\n\nAs general secretary of the Afghanistan soccer federation, Aghazada worked with its now-disgraced president Keramuudin Karim.\n\nAfghanistan women\u2019s national team players had accused federation officials of sexual abuse and cover-ups for several years.\n\nFIFA banned Karim for life in June after he was accused by several players of \u201crepeated sexual abuse.\u201d He was also fined 1 million Swiss francs ($1 million).\n\nAfghan judicial authorities and FIFA announced investigations last year when players went public with allegations, seeming frustrated with the pace of previously confidential inquiries.\n\nAfter Karim was banned during the Women\u2019s World Cup, the American coach of the Afghanistan women\u2019s team, Kelly Lindsey, criticized FIFA for not pursuing other officials more aggressively.\n\nIn April, Aghazada was elected to a four-year term on the Asian soccer confederation\u2019s ruling committee. This was despite the Afghan soccer body being subject to ongoing investigations.\n\nBefore the elections, former FIFA vice president Prince Ali of Jordan had called on Afghan candidates to be barred while implicated.\n\nAghazada can appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In further fallout from a sexual abuse scandal, Afghanistan's top soccer official was banned for five years by FIFA on Friday after failing to act on allegations made by women's national team players.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Graham Dunbar"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
