And it was Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar, who make up the core of the liberal wing of the ladies\u2019 table, that were trashing Will and Grace star Debra Messing\u2019s call to pretty much create an enemies\u2019 list that named all the folks who donate to Donald Trump\u2019s re-election effort. Of course, these clowns will say they don\u2019t want violence to befall the people that they doxx, but no one is that dense. Okay\u2014maybe in Hollywood, that\u2019s the case\u2014but there is not doubt that given the rise of left-wing extremism in the country that\u2019s going underreported\u2014cough* Antifa cough*\u2013these folks will be harassed. And yes, there is a chance those targeted could end up being inflicted with bodily harm. Liberal America is insane.\n\nGoldberg and Behar were apt to point this out and to note that this is America, you can vote for Republicans without fear. Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX) created a firestorm in early August when he publicly disclosed the names of those who donated to Trump in his district. Some of those people had donated to him, which makes this move even more idiotic. Castro said he didn\u2019t doxx anyone and does not wish violence or harassment to follow, but that\u2019s exactly what happened because this is the real world, Juli\u2014you insufferable moron. If The View gets it, so can you, congressman (via Newsbusters):\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-host Whoopi Goldberg began the first show of The View\u2019s new season displaying a more libertarian stance on hot-button issues such as gun rights and free speech. After suggesting that we didn\u2019t necessarily need more gun laws, but needed to close the loopholes in our current laws at the beginning of the show, she went on to make an impassioned plea for her fellow actors in Hollywood to stop blacklisting Trump supporters. The segment started with Whoopi reading off the news that Will and Grace actress Debra Messing and her co-star Eric McCormack had tweeted over the weekend that the media needed to print a list of donors to Trump\u2019s fundraiser in Hollywood because they didn\u2019t want to work with them. [\u2026] \u201cWhen its individuals, then you\u2019re stalking and you\u2019re starting to endanger that person\u2019s life. So I don\u2019t approve of that,\u201d Behar argued. [\u2026] Whoopi got the last word in the conversation and she came out strongly against this type of behavior, even making a statement that would make many liberals heads explode today: \u201cPeople can vote for who they want to...you don\u2019t have to like it!\u201d\n\nBut make no mistake, this is what the Left is going to do next year. They\u2019re coming after us. We don\u2019t vote with them, so we\u2019re trash. Who cares what the Left thinks? Who cares what the liberal media thinks? If you support Trump, just don\u2019t forget to vote on Election Day. Remind your friends, your neighbors, and your like-minded patriots to vote on Election Day. Also, don\u2019t be queasy if attacked, fight back. And fight back with brutal fervor.", "description": ".09/04/2019 19:38:37PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Katie Pavlich", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/100/7e25d624-96a8-45a4-9e52-be3dde6fbb4e.jpg"}
