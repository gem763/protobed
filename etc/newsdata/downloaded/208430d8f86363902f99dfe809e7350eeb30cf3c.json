Mike Scott held the franchise postseason record for strikeouts with 14 set Oct. 8, 1986, against the New York Mets in the National League Championship Series.\n\nDominant by every measure, Cole surrendered just four hits and did not issue a walk until his 3-2 slider to Rays shortstop Willy Adames just missed the outside part of the plate with two outs in the top of the eighth.\n\nCole ceded the mound to closer Roberto Osuna, who promptly struck out Yandy Diaz on three pitches to preserve what was then the Astros' two-run advantage.\n\nAfter the Astros added a run in the bottom of the eighth, Osuna surrendered a run in the ninth and was pulled with the bases loaded with one out.\n\nWill Harris promptly struck out Travis d'Arnaud and got Kevin Kiemaier to ground out to get the save. The Astros will take a 2-0 series lead to St. Petersburg for Game 3 on Monday.\n\nCole threw 118 pitches, 83 for strikes, and his 33 swinging strikes were the most in a playoff start in the data-tracking era. He averaged 97.9 miles per hour on 60 four-seam fastballs, struck out every batter at least once, and fanned Ji-Man Choi and Brandon Lowe three times each.\n\nDespite that performance, the game hung in the balance when Cole departed.\n\nThe Astros scratched across one run off Rays starter Blake Snell (0-1), with Alex Bregman winning a seven-pitch confrontation by drilling a leadoff home run to left field in the fourth inning.\n\nHouston had runners on the corners with no outs in the fifth yet failed to score against Rays right-hander Diego Castillo.\n\nThe Astros needed a bloop single to center from Maldonado in the seventh to double their 1-0 lead. Maldonado, who erased Adames as part of a strikeout-throw out double play in the sixth, drove home Yuli Gurriel after twice failing to deliver a safety squeeze bunt.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "HOUSTON -- Gerrit Cole set a club postseason record with 15 strikeouts while  battery mate Martin Maldonado delivered both at the plate and behind it as the ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
