Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC overnight that he was confident enough lawmakers would back the deal this week.\n\n\"The weekend's events, if anything, have further reduced the risk of disorderly exit,\" said Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in London.\n\n\"If there is a knee-jerk negative reaction in the pound as we emerge from the weekend with a greater overhang of uncertainty than hoped and some of the long positions are unwound, it should be faded soon.\"\n\nThe European Union will play for time rather than rush to decide on London's reluctant request to delay Brexit again, diplomats said on Sunday. weary of the Brexit process, EU leaders are keen to avoid a disorderly exit and are unlikely to reject the request. They hope the deal can eventually be approved in London. Sachs GS.N said on Sunday that it lowered the probability of a no-deal Brexit to 5% from 10% and maintained its baseline view that the UK will leave the EU on Oct. 31. uncertainty is likely to weigh on sterling when trading resumes in Asia Pacific on Oct. 21.
