Companies now need to think about a lot more than just their bottom lines.\n\nAmerica needs \"a new, more sustainable, more equitable, more fair capitalism,\" Benioff told CNN's Poppy Harlow in a Boss Files interview this week.\n\nUnder that new model, he says companies should think about maximizing not just shareholder returns but also what he calls \"stakeholder\" returns. Stakeholders aren't just those who invest in the company, Benioff says, but those in the surrounding community and beyond. That's also the message behind his new book, \"Trailblazer,\" released this week.\n\nIt is, perhaps, a surprising thing to hear from a billionaire whose company brought in more than $1.1 billion in net income last year and has seen its stock grow more than 3,000% since it went public in 2004. But Salesforce, Benioff claims, is already following that model.\n\nThe company has given away $300 million in grants, provided its customer relationship management software to 40,000 nonprofits for free and its employees have done some 4 million hours of volunteer work, Benioff said.", "description": "The old adage from Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman that \"the business of business is business\" is dead, says Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.
