They were meant to give the economy a little bit of extra padding in case risks on the horizon \u2014 from uncertainty created by President Trump\u2019s trade war to economic weakening in Asia and Europe that threatened to spill over \u2014 turned into realities.\n\nData increasingly suggest that a slowdown is, in fact, materializing. Both of the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s closely watched surveys, one that tracks manufacturing and another that monitors services, posted declines for September, reports this week showed. Consumer confidence has shown signs of weakening, and while spending is still growing, it has slowed from a robust pace earlier this year.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, investors have ramped up their expectations for a rate cut at the Fed\u2019s Oct. 29-30 meeting.
