The broader idea is to help them with goal management, and to make it easier for them to make progress against their own metrics and goals.\n\nKoan, which integrates with a wide number of third parties, from Salesforce to Slack, employs just 10 people at this point and is based in Portland, Ore., though Tucker works from Palo Alto, where, interestingly, he and his wife also operate a company called Blind Tiger Ice.\n\nInspired by their international travels to upgrade in some way their local dining (and drinks) experience, the couple\u2019s nearly two-year-old company is becoming known in some tech circles for its \u201chigh-quality cocktail ice,\u201d as Tucker describes it. Among its customers: Netflix, Facebook, Google and the world-famous Yountville, Calif.-based restaurant French Laundry.\n\nEvery once in a while, too, says Tucker, his worlds collide. Recently, for example, the venture firm CRV called Blind Tiger to order ice for a party it was throwing. The portfolio company it was celebrating: Iterable, a growth marketing startup and also a Koan customer.\n\nKoan has now raised $5 million. Earlier investors include the Webb Investment Network, SV Angel and Spider Capital, all of which participated in the company\u2019s newest round.\n\nAbove, left to right: Co-founders Matt Tucker and Scott Campbell, an early salesperson at Jive Software.", "description": "Koan, a three-year-old online platform that aims to help teams achieve their objectives and stay engaged, has raised $3 million in seed funding led by Uncork Capital and Crosslink.
