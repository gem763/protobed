Then he\u2019ll use the full heft of the federal government to jam your operations.\n\nTrump thought he\u2019d win accolades from automakers like General Motors and Ford by rolling back stringent fuel-economy standards President Obama put in place. Apparently he never asked the automakers about that. Because Trump is now learning the car industry doesn\u2019t exactly want the gifts he\u2019s offering.\n\nTrump\u2019s fuel-economy rollback has created a giant rift with California and a dozen other states, which for years had standards stricter than the federal rules, because of localized pollution problems. Trump is now attempting to revoke California\u2019s right to set its own rules, which is bound to become yet another Trumpworld legal morass that could take years to sort out.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t be happening, but it\u2019s worth trying to follow along why it is. Because of smog in southern California, the state imposed the nation\u2019s first tailpipe emission standards in 1966. The federal Clean Air Act of 1970 gave Washington the authority to regulate pollution from cars nationwide. But since California was already doing that, the law allowed California to set its own rules, as long they met or exceeded federal ones.\n\nEver since, California has received waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency allowing it to set its own fuel-economy standards. Over time, a dozen other states adopted California\u2019s higher standards, which now govern about 33% of the U.S. car market.\n\n[See why the GM strike won\u2019t revive unions.]\n\nIt generally costs automakers more to build cars that meet the higher standards, but there\u2019s an offsetting factor: They don\u2019t want to build two sets of cars for two different pollution regimes. President Obama ratcheted up the federal fuel-economy standards in 2012, setting tough new targets for automakers to meet. They agreed for a few reasons. One, the new federal rules would be harmonized with California\u2019s, effectively setting one national standard instead of two. Another reason: There would be interim reviews allowing for changes in the new rules if needed technology developments weren\u2019t coming fast enough.\n\nFord Rouge assembly plant in Dearborn, Mich. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio, File) More\n\nDrastic rollbacks from Obama-era standards\n\nAt the tail end of the Obama presidency, in early 2017, the government finalized the new rules without an interim review automakers expected. California did the same. That irked carmakers, who then appealed to Trump for relief. What they didn\u2019t expect was a rollback under Trump so drastic that it created a fresh schism with California, which is sticking with the Obama-era targets. If the Trump and California rules both survive, there will be two national standards again starting in 2021, when the Trump rollbacks go into effect.\n\nFour automakers\u2014BMW, Ford, Honda and Volkswagen\u2014recently made a deal with California to meet pollution rules that are a bit more permissive than the Obama standards, but much stricter than Trump\u2019s. Other automakers, including GM, would probably be happy to do the same, but are wary of provoking Trump.\n\nSuch caution is prudent. On Sept. 18, Trump directed the government to revoke California\u2019s waiver, setting in motion a certain legal battle. The law says the EPA can either grant or deny a waiver to California. It doesn\u2019t say the feds can revoke a waiver that\u2019s already been issued. The current waiver, issued by the Obama administration, runs through 2025.\n\nForcing car makers to build to lower standards\n\nOn top of that, the Trump Justice Department, obviously channeling Trump\u2019s personal rage, has launched a dubious antitrust investigation of the four automakers that agreed to abide by the California standards. Normally, the kind of anticompetitive behavior that triggers antitrust action involves companies colluding to drive up prices or harm consumers in some blatant way. That\u2019s not an issue here. Trump\u2019s antitrust goons are going after four auto companies for setting emissions standards higher than Trump wants them to.", "description": "Yet another industry he's driving into the ditch.", "authors": ["Rick Newman", "Senior Columnist"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EC4r2feO6KqNx1U7auRvyA--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/e8a5a1e0-da3d-11e9-9ee4-17b2c47bbacd", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
