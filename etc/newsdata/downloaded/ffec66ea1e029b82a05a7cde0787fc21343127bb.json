In the more extreme cases, the inability to charge market prices compels landlords to pull their properties from the market. This pressure on landlords has a two-prong effect over time: it reduces both the quality of the current supply and the quantity of current supply.\n\nIt gets worse. In some cities, such as San Francisco, a recent jump in apartment fires has raised suspicions that landlords are burning down their own buildings in order to avoid having their units subjected to rent-control restrictions. As reported by CBS SF Bay Area, \u201cA fire could be a lucrative disaster for a landlord owning a rent-controlled building, the report mentions. Insurance covers the rebuild and tenants who don\u2019t move back in, either because they died or can\u2019t wait for reconstruction, makes room those able to pay market-rate rent.\u201d While it\u2019s very hard to prove arson, the fact that an economic system creates a possible incentive for people to destroy their own property spells disaster long-term.\n\nRent control also affects demand for apartments, as well. When the price of something is artificially depressed and doesn\u2019t reflect the product\u2019s scarcity, it tends to create a too-high demand for the actual availability of apartments. This fact translates into long waiting lists for rent-controlled apartments and general housing shortages.", "description": "", "authors": ["Erielle Davidson", "Thefederalist.Com Why-Bernie-Sanders-Nationwide-Rent-Control-Proposal-Is-Nuts"], "top_image": ""}
