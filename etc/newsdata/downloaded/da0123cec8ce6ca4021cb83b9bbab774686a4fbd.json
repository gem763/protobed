But that meant just under a quarter of votes cast by independent shareholders were against him.\n\nIn April, Sports Direct failed to prevent department store chain Debenhams from falling into administration and saw its equity stake wiped out.\n\nIn July, the group warned it could face a 674 million euro bill from Belgium's tax authority and said last year's purchase of department store group House of Fraser out of administration may have been a mistake.\n\nSports Direct's auditor Grant Thornton has also quit and the retailer is struggling to find a successor.\n\nAshley barred media from attending the meeting.", "description": "Sports Direct's Ashley re-elected to board despite protest", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF8A14R_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
