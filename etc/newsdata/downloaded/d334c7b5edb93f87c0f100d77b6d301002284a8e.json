The myth of Robin Hood, with its injunction to take from the rich and give to the poor, was the remainer\u2019s myth. It represented a belief in slow, almost invisible political change \u2013 effected through things like the NHS and progressive taxation \u2013 which, while worthy, was in the end slightly boring. In contrast, the leaver\u2019s favoured myth, George and the Dragon, was dramatic and triumphant. It celebrated beating your oppressors and not worrying too much about what came afterwards. As such, it was inevitably more attractive at the ballot box. \u201cThe Brexiteers succeeded,\u201d wrote Meek, not because they had better arguments but \u201cbecause they shared the dream vision of enough of the voters\u201d.\n\nHistorical fiction usually approaches the dream visions of the past in one of two ways. The first, best exemplified by the sympathetically intelligent novels of Hilary Mantel, plunders them for evidence that things have probably always been much as they are today. The second uses history, as TS Eliot said of James Joyce\u2019s \u201cmythic method\u201d in Ulysses, as a way of \u201ccontrolling, of ordering, of giving shape and significance\u201d to the contemporary moment. One approach represents history as stasis, the other as allegory. To Calais, in Ordinary Time, Meek\u2019s rich and strange new novel, combines elements of both, and one of the many deep and destabilising pleasures it offers comes from trying to work out precisely what kind of a book \u2013 and what kind of a world \u2013 you are in at any particular moment.\n\nThe setting is straightforwardly historical. It is south-west England in 1348, two years after the battle of Cr\u00e9cy, a decisive conflict in the hundred years war when a handful of English archers routed the French and went on to capture Calais. Edward III is on the throne; religious and cultural capital is entrenched on the continent; plague stalks the land. The contemporary parallels \u2013 with Brexit, with the existential threat of climate crisis \u2013 are there for the making, but Meek never labours them.\n\nThere are three principal actors: a serf named Will Quate, bound to work the land owned by a local nobleman; Lady Bernadine, that nobleman\u2019s daughter; and Thomas Pitkerro, a proctor or clerical administrator from Avignon on secondment to Malmesbury Abbey. Will is betrothed to the village beauty, but his desires lie elsewhere and he dreams of becoming a free man. Bernadine, fed on a diet of courtly love culled from Le Roman de la Rose, also wants to escape the smallness of village life. She is engaged to a nobleman her father\u2019s age, but thinks she is really in love with a young knight named Laurence Haket. Pitkerro, haunted by guilt over his intellectual and moral failings, simply wants to go home.\n\nHaket has raised a band of archers to send to France, led by a religiously fanatical giant of a man named Hayne, and Will, Bernadine and Thomas join them on the road south to Dorset, where a ship waits to take them to France. Coming the other way, as a rumour on the wind, is the plague.\n\nYou never know with this novel if you\u2019re reading a comedy of manners, a dystopian novel or a medieval porno\n\nLike The People\u2019s Act of Love, Meek\u2019s historical moral fable set in 1920s Russia, which was longlisted for the Man Booker prize in 2005, the novel is staged as a series of almost magically strange encounters and scenes: marvels, you might call them. At Malmesbury Abbey the Abbot desperately organises shifts of his choir to sing protective hymns against the plague, until they tire and their voices fail. There is a pageant, balletically violent fight scenes \u2013 as good as anything in Cormac McCarthy \u2013 and some memorable sexual encounters. The overall effect is of a radical generic ambiguity, so that you never know if you\u2019re reading a comedy of manners, a bawdy romance, a dystopian novel or a medieval porno.\n\nMeek\u2019s narrative is shared evenly between the three central characters. Thomas\u2019s sections take the form of journal entries (I did wonder about this: it would be a very rich scholar indeed who could afford sufficient parchment to keep a daily diary in 1348). His prose is fussy, precise and clotted with Latinisms. An archer with a facial scar \u201chas a fissure dividing the dexter and sinister parts of his face, a cicatrix so profound it appears he has been formed of dual semi-humans, conglutined into unity\u201d. Quate is described as \u201csolid of form, pectorally muscled, but with the face of an angel, a tranquil gestus and an intelligent aspect\u201d. Meek has a lot of fun with the comic possibilities of the epistolary mode, where events are narrated almost in real time and characters hurry to keep up with their own writing. \u201cI cannot postpone the manual examination of the symptomatic area,\u201d Thomas scribbles feverishly when he suspects he might be infected with plague. \u201cI must momentarily put aside my scribal implements.\u201d\n\nWill and Bernadine\u2019s narratives are written in close third person, the language reflecting their social status and education. Will and his peers speak (and are narrated) in a folksy Cotswold dialect, \u201cas if\u201d, reflects the refined Bernadine, \u201cno French never touched their tongues\u201d. They use \u201cneb\u201d for face, \u201csteven\u201d for voice, \u201ccunny\u201d and \u201cpintle\u201d for vagina and penis. Bodies are \u201clickerous\u201d. Will\u2019s sections are peppered with syntactic archaisms, double negatives, and the French negative \u201cne\u201d (\u201che ne breathed no more\u201d). Bernadine\u2019s \u2013 more formal and stuffy \u2013 read more like modern English. \u201cShe told the porter curtly that the demoiselle required a brief halt to refresh herself and her horse before continuing to Edington.\u201d Metaphors feel both surprising and historically appropriate. A cheese stops a shutter closing \u201clike to the bailiff\u2019s foot in the bondsman\u2019s door\u201d; a man\u2019s voice sounds \u201clike to when a ploughman frots an ear of corn between his hands to know its ripeness\u201d.\n\nEnglish myths (and the myth of Englishness) permeate many recent novels. Max Porter\u2019s Lanny, Benjamin Myers\u2019s The Gallows Pole and Anthony Cartwright\u2019s Iron Towns all mine folkloric tradition or use a stylistically exuberant, often archaically mythic register to tell stories about marginalised communities threatened by external forces. The most prominent of these is Paul Kingsnorth\u2019s The Wake, a novel about the Norman invasion written in mock Anglo-Saxon, which was longlisted for the Man Booker prize in 2014. At its best this kind of writing can be excitingly estranging; at its worst it can seem \u2013 whatever you make of its politics \u2013 portentous and silly. It is an audacious thing to try to create a world sufficient to be described in an invented language, but in To Calais, in Ordinary Time the effect is triumphant. Meek\u2019s language isn\u2019t much like the Middle English Chaucer wrote, but nor is it parody or pastiche. There are anachronisms, but they don\u2019t really matter. Instead the effect generated is of a kind of psychologically realistic medieval pageantry.\n\nAt the centre of this beautiful novel is an exploration of the difference between romance and true love, allegory and reality, history and the present. It plays out in unexpected and delightful ways, and it would be unfair to make these explicit. To Calais, in Ordinary Time ends with a consummation both of its technique and of its story that is affirming, tender and a little bit glorious.\n\n\u2022 To Calais, in Ordinary Time is published by Canongate (\u00a318.99).
