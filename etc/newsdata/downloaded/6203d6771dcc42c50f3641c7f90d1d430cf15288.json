The other four are still near the Sugar Beach area of Kihei, a coastal Maui town.\n\n___\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nMarine wildlife officials say they euthanized two dolphins that stranded on a Maui beach, less than a month after another mass stranding in the same area.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Tuesday the bodies of the two pygmy killer whales are being flown to Oahu for post-mortem examination by the University of Hawaii.\n\nAgency officials are monitoring four other members of the same species that are milling close to shore at Sugar Beach.\n\nPygmy killer whales are dolphins that are often confused with false killer whales and melon-headed whales. The species is found primarily in deep waters throughout tropical and subtropical areas of the world.\n\nFive marine mammals died after a mass stranding along the same beach in late August. Four of the five were euthanized.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on dolphins stranding on a Hawaii beach (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
