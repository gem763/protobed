When it comes to impeachment, Pelosi has been patient and pragmatic. But Donald Trump has shown himself worthy of it.\n\nIt\u2019s worth repeating that coercing or extorting the president of Ukraine to investigate a political rival\u2014as The Wall Street Journal and other outlets have reported, and as Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani essentially confessed\u2014is a clearly impeachable act. This is true even if a quid pro quo was not proffered.\n\nMake no mistake, I haven\u2019t suddenly changed my political positions. I still agree with the Republicans on virtually all policy matters. It\u2019s just that the GOP has abandoned any claim to being the party of values or character.", "description": "Yes, it feels awfully weird to be on the Democratic Speaker's side.
