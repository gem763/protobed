When it came to his whereabouts, he was right there in plain sight, on the top of the world as the fastest man in the game. And so we sigh.\n\nHis run of 9.76sec to take the 100m gold was quite something, of course. Likewise his domination of these Championships, which saw him clock the fastest time in each of the three rounds.\n\nStage by stage by stage, 9.98sec to 9.88sec to 9.76sec, he had no need for the VAR, no need for a second look. Daylight, every time.\n\nWhen it mattered most in Doha on Saturday night Christian Coleman did not go missing\n\nThere have to be mentions for Justin Gatlin and Andre De Grasse, who respectively took silver in 9.89sec and bronze in 9.90sec, but it was a one-man show, really.\n\nGun to tape. And in isolation, in a vacuum, that should be satisfying \u2013 a clear answer to a clear question of who is the best.\n\nExcept that would be a little daft, wouldn't it? We all know too much now, and as the pitifully small crowds in Doha cheered this 23-year-old from America, it seemed necessary to remember the details.\n\nTo remember the shades of grey that come from the fact he was only competing because he escaped a 'whereabouts' doping charge on a technicality a few weeks back.\n\nHis missed test and two filing failures might have crept through an obscure loophole, but any time there is doubt over a champion in athletics, it strips away another layer of trust. It puts another pin in the balloon. And so we sigh some more.\n\nThat, simply, is the baggage of the sport and especially 100m, a distance at which nine of the 10 fastest men in history have had some kind of brush with doping authorities.\n\nIf it's unfair that Coleman comes with such caveats - as a man who swears his innocence on all doping fronts - then it is only because he didn't pay enough attention. And that's on him, which is why Michael Johnson was right to say on Friday that he can never now be the face of his sport.\n\nColeman took the 100m gold at the World Championships with a run of 9.76sec\n\nThose comments were put to him late last night after a doping test kept him from his press conference for over an hour.\n\n'Michael Johnson doesn't pay my bills and he doesn't write my cheques,' he responded. 'I wouldn't know who Michael Johnson was if he didn't run fast times.\n\n'I don't care what he has to say necessarily but I kind of disagree. The faces go to who put up right times and represent the sport in the right way.'\n\nRepresent the sport the right way? Interesting and more so by his following comments. Had he been careless, for instance, in his responsibilities?\n\n'No, I haven't been careless. I can be more mature and diligent. I am young, I travel the world, I have friends and family in different places.\n\n'Sometimes it is not on your mind to update this app. Going forward I will try to do a better job of being more diligent.'\n\nMany elite athletes and even mediocre ones would find that borderline dismissive attitude astonishing. Similarly his failure to accurately recall if he had previously encountered similar 'whereabouts' failures, and his attempts to make the furore about race, saying folk were 'hating on a young black kid living his dream'.\n\nNothing to do with it.\n\nColeman celebrates with the American flag on his shoulders after roaring to victory\n\nBut in any case, all hail your new king, successor to Justin Gatlin, twice banned himself. Now, with the sixth fastest time in history and a fresh personal best, Coleman holds the sceptre.\n\nFurther back on the track, Zharnel Hughes of Britain was sixth in 10.03sec, an underwhelming outcome on an underwhelming event.\n\nYou would bank on Dina Asher-Smith to salvage the home pride.\n\nHer comfort in clocking 10.96sec in her 100m heat and qualifying third fastest for Sunday's semi-finals only heightens the confidence in her getting a medal.\n\nReaching the final at 9.20pm ought to be formality, but Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, the two-time Olympic champion, will be favourite for gold after running 10.80sec \u2013 the quickest heat in history. Time will tell.\n\nAnd time will tell on how we will eventually view the latest king of the 100m.
