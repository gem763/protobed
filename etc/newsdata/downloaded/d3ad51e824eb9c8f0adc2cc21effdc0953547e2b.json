Biblical spoof \u201cLife of Brian\u201d and their three other feature films are also being shown.\n\nThe celebrations also showcase the members\u2019 post-Python work such as Cleese\u2019s \u201cFawlty Towers\u201d.\n\n\u201cPython has survived because we live in an increasingly Pythonesque world,\u201d the troupe said in a press release. \u201cExtreme silliness seems more relevant now than it ever was.\u201d", "description": "In what is billed as an \"extremely silly\" event, hordes of Monty Python fans will gather in full Gumby attire in London on Saturday to celebrate the British comedy troupe's 50th anniversary.", "authors": ["Angus Macswan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437036268&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF93106", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
