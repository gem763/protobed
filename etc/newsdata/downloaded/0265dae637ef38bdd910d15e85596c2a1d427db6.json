Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nHow close are we to that? The received wisdom is that even now, despite the odd dark rumbling from the French and Latvians, none of the 27 is quite ready to kick us out.\n\nAny one of them could, simply by vetoing the request for an extension from Boris Johnson (should he see fit to obey the law of the land) or a proxy representative from the Muthah of Parliaments.\n\nBut the smug assumption is that none will break ranks and take the rap for the economic anguish a no-deal exit would visit on Ireland, and less dramatically on other EU countries.\n\nYou will have noticed that the smug assumption hasn\u2019t been on sparkling political form in recent years. David Cameron complacently assumed the referendum would be easily won (he hoped for a 70-30 Remain landslide, as he reveals in his memoir). Hillary Clinton suicidally assumed Trump was too unelectable to justify her visiting the Rust Belt states.\n\nNever assume, as the saying counsels, it makes a right twat out of you and me. The EU 27\u2019s tolerance is visibly narrowing by the day.\n\nWe saw an acrid hint in Luxembourg on Monday, after the Hulk turned green at the prospect of expat heckling and, muttering \u201cI hate you, I HATE you\u201d, made the traditional door-slamming retreat to his room.\n\nIf Luxembourg prime minister Xavier Bettel\u2019s byplay with the empty podium and unyoked fury about the continuing failure of someone to do any homework humiliated Boris the Teenager, it put the fear of bejeesus into this Remainer.\n\nBettel\u2019s abandonment of the diplomatic niceties looked remarkably like the reaction of a parent who is one tantrum shy of breaking point.\n\nIt pays tribute to Johnson\u2019s tremendous success in his campaign to reclaim absolute power over our own affairs that Bettel, the leader of a country with roughly the population of Bristol, has absolute power over our affairs.\n\nThe House of Commons can pass what legislation it wishes to outlaw no deal, and even replace Johnson with a caretaker mandated to take the trusty brush to Brussels and sweep up another extension.\n\nBut barring the nuclear option outlined below, nothing the Commons can do will matter a jot if Bettel or one of his 26 counterparts finally snaps.\n\nCould this have been the Cummings-Johnson masterplan all along? Has the chaos they\u2019ve unleashed and their contemptuous refusal to negotiate been a cunning blind, to divert attention to the Commons and the Supreme Court while they goad the EU into doing their work for them by vetoing an extension?\n\nIf that flatters their strategic intelligence, consider what an exquisite solution for them this would be. A monosyllable from one of the 27 (\u201cnon\u201d), and they scoop the pot. Britain crashes out on Halloween, Farage\u2019s Brexit Party spontaneously expires, the Lib Dems raison d\u2019etre dies with it, and we\u2019re back in a two-party scrap which Johnson, as the hero of Brexit, could expect to win handsomely.\n\nWithin a few years, Scotland and all those SNP MPs leave the union, and Northern Ireland reunites with the republic. The England and Wales that remains is a nasty, shrill, narrow right-wing client kingdom of the United States. It\u2019s the very wettest of Johnson-Cummings dreams.\n\nIn the event of a veto, that nuclear option is for the Commons to pass a vote of no confidence in Johnson, and give Jeremy Corbyn a nominal majority to take to the Queen in time for him to revoke Article 50.\n\nOn various grounds, that\u2019s one hell of a Hail Mary. It would test the strength of Jo Swinson\u2019s commitment to Remain. She\u2019d have to renege on the promise never to enable a Corbyn premiership, and would destroy herself in the process.\n\nCorbyn would have to make the ultimate self-sacrifice since revocation would virtually guarantee a Tory win in the next general election. But in the event of a veto, it would be the only way to avoid no deal.\n\nAnd a veto cannot by blithely discounted. If the patience of the 27 hasn\u2019t wholly evaporated yet, here\u2019s hoping a remark from the outgoing speaker evades their notice.\n\nJohn Bercow warns that, regardless of the outcome in the coming weeks and months, the debate about the relationship with Europe will continue here for another 20 years. Would you blame Bettel, who looked like he couldn\u2019t bear another 20 seconds, or any of them, for concluding that it\u2019s high time to dump the poisonous little bleeder\u2019s gear on the doorstep in bin bags, and change the locks?", "description": "After three years of endlessly asking what is wrong with us, the psychiatric questioning shifts across the Channel to ask what is wrong with them?
