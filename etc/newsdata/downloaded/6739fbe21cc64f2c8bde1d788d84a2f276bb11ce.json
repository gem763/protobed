(\u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro thundered from the wings, in a factually debatable assault on Biden\u2019s health plan. \u201cAre you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I can't believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you're saying they don't have to buy in. You're forgetting that.\u201d)\n\nAnd they will likely include two of Biden\u2019s less impressive answers toward the last hour of the debate\u2014on Iraq and on education. Biden\u2019s latter answer included the semi-coherent advice to parents to: \u201cPlay the radio, make sure the television\u2014excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the\u2014make sure that kids hear words, a kid coming from a very poor school, a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time we get there.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n(Unsolicited tip to Biden\u2019s debate prep team: Advising parents to keep \u201cthe record player on at night\u201d may not be helpful if your candidate is trying to allay concerns about his age.)\n\nThere will be praise for the passion of Beto O\u2019Rourke on guns, the thoughtful replies of Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and the appealing deliveries of Senators Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar.\n\nBut perhaps the most notable takeaway is how good Elizabeth Warren in this format. There was no one moment of stand-out eloquence, no flash of humor that sent the audience and debaters laughing. It was, rather, her capacity to turn every question into an occasion for an answer that demonstrates political shrewdness, if not always substantive candor.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/25/a1/ce1dee70451ab229deac77900923/compilation.png\" true\n\nFor instance, she still will not say that her health career plan will raise taxes for the middle class, which it almost certainly will and which Bernie Sanders frankly acknowledges. Instead, she says:\n\n\u201cWhat families have to deal with is cost, total cost.\u2026And understand, families are paying for their health care today. Families pay, every time an insurance company says, sorry, you can't see that specialist. Every time an insurance company says\u2026sorry, we are not covering that prescription. Families are paying every time they don't get a prescription filled because they can't pay for it. They don't have a lump checked out because they can't afford the copay. What we're talking about here is what's going to happen in families\u2019 pockets, what's going to happen in their budgets...\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a direct answer, you\u2019re going to have a long wait.\n\nOn the subject of education, Warren fused her personal background with a message aimed squarely at the public school unions that form a key part of the Democratic Party\u2019s base\u2014rejecting flatly the idea of public money for charter schools\u2014 and managed to shoehorn in another popular notion as well.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Warren said, \u201cI think I'm the only person on this stage who has been a public school teacher. I wanted to be a public school teacher since I was in second grade. And let's be clear in all the ways we talk about this, money for public schools should stay in public schools. Not go anywhere else. I've already made my commitment. I will\u2014we will have a secretary of education who has been a public school teacher. I think this is ultimately about our values. I have proposed a two-cent wealth tax on the top one-tenth of one percent in this country. That would give us enough money to start with our babies by providing universal child care for every baby age 0 to 5. Universal pre-k for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old in this country, raise the wages of every child care worker and preschool teacher in this country. Cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the folks who\u2019ve got it.\u201d\n\nThis is a skill most debaters, even those with years in public life, do not possess. They know how to deliver up packaged pieces of policy, and predictable applause lines. But taking a question and using it as a platform for a coherent message is a skill in short supply. (The last Presidential candidate to demonstrate such skill was Newt Gingrich back in 2012).\n\nWarren had an \u201coptics\u201d advantage as well. Compared to Bernie Sanders, whose hoarse throat made him seem more of a worn-out soapbox orator, Warren\u2019s more temperate delivery was well suited to the TV screen.\n\nThere remain for Warren and for most of the other candidates some of the same landmines the first appeared back in June.\n\nNo one seems to have any clear answer to the question of whether-or even how\u2014illegal immigration can be curbed. The near-universal embrace of the idea that America is an inherently racist nation is a view very different from that expressed by the last Democratic president, and one that may well trigger a sharp pushback. When Beto O\u2019Rourke says, \u201cYes, I\u2019m coming for your guns,\u201d (or at least the AR-15s and the AK-47s), you can all but glimpse the TV ad.\n\nThat not so incidental issue aside, the debate left one clear impression, at least for me, when it comes to this format, Warren is in a class by herself.\n\nThis article tagged under: 2020", "description": "She delivered her most controversial policy ideas on her terms, even if it meant avoiding some inconvenient facts.", "authors": ["Jeff Greenfield"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/dc/0b/2de7f5924bea90ea9213f3e2715b/gettyimages-1174344854-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
