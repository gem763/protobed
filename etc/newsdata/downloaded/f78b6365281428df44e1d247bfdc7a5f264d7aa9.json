While the testimony has taken place behind closed doors, the public has also learned a wealth of information relating to Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and much of it does not bode well for Trump.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of the key players in the impeachment inquiry and the details that Democrats will likely highlight to make their case against the president.\n\nJoseph Maguire\n\nWhen he appeared before the House Intelligence Committee on Sept. 26, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire defended his handling of the whistleblower complaint, which was initially withheld from Congress. But Maguire also undercut a key Trump talking point when he asserted that \u201cthe whistleblower did the right thing\u201d by coming forward. \u201cI think he followed the law every step of the way,\u201d Maguire added.\n\nKurt Volker\n\nThe State Department\u2019s former special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker resigned his position in late September. When he testified before the Intelligence Committee on Oct. 3, he brought along text exchanges between members of the administration that showed that U.S. officials believed Trump wanted a Ukrainian investigation into Biden as a condition for a White House meeting with the country\u2019s president. Republicans on the committee argued that nothing Volker said implicated Trump directly.\n\nMichael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community, arrives at the Capitol on Oct. 4.

Scott Applewhite/AP) More\n\nMichael Atkinson\n\nThat the whistleblower complaint ever saw the light of day, or that Trump now faces an impeachment inquiry, can be traced to the actions of intelligence community Inspector General Michael Atkinson. Bound by law to notify Congress if he is \u201cunable to resolve\u201d a dispute over a whistleblower complaint with the director of national intelligence, Atkinson wrote two letters in September after flagging the report on the Ukraine matter. On Oct. 4, Atkinson detailed his fears that the Justice Department would bury the whistleblower complaint and his belief that Congress was required by law to obtain it.\n\nMarie Yovanovitch\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified on Friday, Oct. 11, that she was recalled from her post by Trump after two Soviet-born U.S. citizens, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, lobbied members of Congress for her removal. Parnas and Fruman also became business partners with Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s lawyer, who introduced the president to Ukrainian officials as part of a plan to dig up dirt on Biden. Portraying Yovanovitch as an impediment to a Ukrainian investigation of Biden, Giuliani also pushed for her to be fired. Yovanovitch told lawmakers that she was unsure why Giuliani had targeted her, but believed that Parnas and Fruman \u201cmay well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine,\u201d the New York Times reported.\n\nLev Parnas and Igor Fruman\n\nOn Wednesday, Oct. 9, the evening before they were scheduled to testify before the House Intelligence Committee, Parnas and Fruman were arrested at Washington\u2019s Dulles Airport, where they were about to leave on a flight to Germany, and charged with federal campaign finance violations for payments made to as-yet-unnamed U.S. politicians. Parnas and Fruman helped Giuliani pursue a Ukrainian investigation of Biden, and on Monday, Reuters reported that Giuliani\u2019s law firm received $500,000 in payments from Parnas. Investigators in the Southern District of New York continue to investigate Giuliani\u2019s bank records.\n\n", "description": "House investigators have turned up plenty of information in the impeachment inquiry of President Trump.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UITIp.1JJ6Dx.OXtiU3nnw--~B/aD0yNTE1O3c9Mzc3NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/4094a3d0-ef86-11e9-be9f-a7b5545f428d", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
