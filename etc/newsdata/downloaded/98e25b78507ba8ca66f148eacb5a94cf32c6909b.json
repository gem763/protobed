Rather than helping the White House control the conversation, the documents became objects of cultural fascination. Newspapers printed them in full as special sections; radio stations broadcast live readings of them; the paperback edition of the transcripts was wildly popular. A prudish White House transcriber had replaced many four-letter words with \u201cexpletive deleted,\u201d which became a popular catchphrase.\n\nMoreover, Congress checked the actual tapes against the transcripts and discovered that someone had edited them in ways that benefited Nixon. For example, one conversation from March 22, 1973, recorded the president telling his aides, \u201cI want you all to stonewall it, let them plead the Fifth Amendment, cover up, or anything else\u201d \u2014 a vivid passage mysteriously absent from the White House transcript.\n\nThe discrepancies between the White House transcripts and the tapes became evidence of further malfeasance. When the Supreme Court ruled that he had to turn over more tapes, including one in which he explicitly directed the Watergate cover-up, Nixon resigned.\n\nNixon did everything he could to prevent Americans from hearing how he sounded in private . Later, he said that his chief mistake in Watergate was not abuse of power, but rather his failure to conceal evidence. \u201cIf the tapes had been destroyed,\u201d he told the journalist David Frost, \u201cI believe that it is likely that I would not have had to go through the agony of resignation.\u201d Nixon realized that the tapes had bared his true self to the public \u2014 and thus cost him the presidency.\n\nTo be sure, Mr. Trump is no stranger to cover-ups. He hides his tax returns and refuses to discuss his businesses. But in the case of the Ukraine phone call, where there is documentation that he asked a foreign leader to interfere in an American election, he insists he has no regrets. His unorthodox conversations, the president insists, are \u201cperfect.\u201d He dares his opponents to find fault with what he presents as his routine conduct of foreign affairs.\n\nNixon\u2019s opponents needed to produce evidence that revealed the real Nixon. The president\u2019s critics today have a greater challenge: to persuade enough voters that the real Mr. Trump \u2014 whom we already know \u2014 is a criminal worth removing from office.", "description": "Unlike the electorate in 1974, voters today have always known that the president is ethically dubious, and many don\u2019t care.", "authors": ["Kathryn Olmsted"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/02/opinion/02Olmsted/02Olmsted-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
