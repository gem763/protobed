Users are also encouraged to connect with partners via the platform to drive new collaborations in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nGENEVA \u2014 To support the SDGs, with a particular focus on SDG 17: Partnership for The Goals, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) has launched Global Health Progress. The knowledge hub highlights industry contributions to the SDGs and enhances opportunities for further collaboration.\n\n2020 marks the 10-year countdown to the SDG deadline. Countries have made progress towards achieving the goals; however, complex health and wellbeing challenges remain \u2013 from poverty and inequality to climate change. Further, many countries are now faced with a double burden of disease \u2013 as they continue to tackle infectious disease challenges, they also battle with an increasing prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) \u2013 which present new issues in implementing effective and sustainable solutions for health.\n\nGlobal Health Progress highlights over 200 collaborations which use innovative approaches to tackle global health challenges. The collaborations are helping to bring different actors together \u2013 governments, academia, multilateral organizations, other private sector companies, local NGOs and more \u2013 to catalyze cross-sector initiatives to tackle health related challenges, as well as address gender equality and education issues. A range of program strategies are being used to address systemic health issues and lay foundations to sustain program gains. In consultation with local actors, IFPMA member companies are fostering local ownership of programs and designing programs according to country\u2019s specific health needs and existing health system infrastructure.\n\nThe collaborations are transforming traditional approaches to partnerships.
