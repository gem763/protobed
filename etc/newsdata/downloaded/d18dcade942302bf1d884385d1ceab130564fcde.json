In January of 2015. And who signed them? John Boehner. And who enacted them, a Republican majority.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThese are not the impeachment hearings. The impeachment hearings have to be held in public by the House Judiciary Committee. This is the initial interview of witnesses to see what they have to say.\u201d\n\nCo-host Ainsley Earhardt asked,\u201d And they will continue to go on and on and on until they find something on the president?\u201d\n\nNapolitano said, \u201cYes. That\u2019s what police and prosecutors do. They come to a conclusion that the person is probably guilty, and then they look for evidence to support or negate that. That\u2019s what Congressman Schiff is doing, and he\u2019s following the rules, as frustrating as those rules are.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Thursday's broadcast of \"Fox & Friends,\" network legal analyst Andrew Napolitano shot down complaints Democrats were holding \u201csecret\u201d hearings | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/SafariScreenSnapz001-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
