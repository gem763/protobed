Photo: STX Films and Vulture\n\nSpoilers for Hustlers below.\n\nHustlers, based on the true story of a group of strippers who shook down hundreds of Wall Street bros for access to their bank accounts, is a lot of things all at once: It\u2019s a dark, late-capitalist fable; an examination of gender politics and self-worth in the early aughts; a pitch-black comedy; a study in moral relativism and latent misogyny; a paean to misunderstood sex workers; a long-overdue Jennifer Lopez showcase. But above all else, it\u2019s a painstakingly detailed historical-period drama.\n\nIn the first half of the film, director Lorene Scafaria carefully recreates the year 2008, that last vestige of cartoonish American excess, to stunning and extremely embarrassing results. For at least 45 straight minutes, I cringed in horrified recognition. Lopez, as the scheming stripper-in-charge, Ramona, struts down the street in a Juicy suit and shiny brown lip gloss. Constance Wu, as Ramona\u2019s mentee, Destiny, hangs out at home in a bra with clear straps, navy platform flip-flops, a denim miniskirt, and a pink tube top that reads \u201cFuck it up, buttercup.\u201d Tiny vests are worn over ripped T-shirts; feather earrings complement shredded, low-cut jeans.\n\nBut the most incredible 2008 simulacrum happens about halfway through the movie. Ramona, Destiny, and their fellow strippers are at the club, getting ready backstage, when suddenly, time slows down. Lizzo, breathless, races into the dressing room, nipple tape shimmering beneath her purple mesh dress, and begins to scream. Every dancer \u2014 Cardi B, Keke Palmer, Lili Reinhart, Jacq the Stripper, Trace Lysette \u2014 halts mid-grooming and rushes the stage, grinding up on each other, ecstatic. \u201cLove in This Club\u201d begins to blare from the speakers. Dollar bills float through the air. Lasers shoot from the ceiling. Confetti pours from the rafters. The entire club moves in unison, as if under an extremely sensual spell. Why?\n\nBecause, as Lizzo puts it, \u201cMotherfucking Usher is here. Usher, bitch!\u201d\n\nUsher, circa 2008. Photo: YouTube\n\nIf you paid any attention to celebrity gossip in the early aughts, you know that Usher, quite proudly, spent his fair share of time in the strip club. A 2008 New York Post article, entitled \u201cConfessions of an Ex-Scores Stripper,\u201d details what his visits were like: \u201cUsher would wander in with a huge entourage, and you\u2019d start to feel like you were in some insane mobster movie, and all the bad things about the place would feel glamorous and cool, rather than sordid and seedy \u2026 All the girls lined up in one long row to dance for Usher.\u201d Usher has even sung about his love for strippers \u2014 his 2014 hit \u201cI Don\u2019t Mind\u201d is a pseudo-woke ode to his stripper lover, who \u201cworks a pole\u201d but \u201cthat don\u2019t make [her] a ho.\u201d\n\nBy bringing the actual Usher into a faithfully recreated version of 2008, Hustlers pulls a fantastic, meta surprise. Watching it all unfold, the delight comes in waves: It\u2019s Usher! In a movie! Playing himself! In the year 2008! At a strip club! Where he used to go all the time in 2008! But the absolute best moment happens a few minutes into the scene: Lopez\u2019s Ramona, resplendent and glowing, squats down on the stage, leaning toward a visibly horny Usher, who\u2019s just stuffed dollar bills into her G-string and joyfully slapped her ass. Ramona grins slyly into his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d she asks playfully. Usher flashes those famous snow-white teeth and looks directly into Lopez\u2019s eyes. \u201cUrsher, baby,\u201d he says.\n\nAgain, there are layers to this shit. Lopez, who was herself a major musical icon in 2008, is pretending to be a no-name stripper while openly flirting with her actual friend and musical equal, Usher, who\u2019s cheekily nodding to his own past while playing himself from 11 years ago. Watching the scene, I was enchanted and disoriented, like I had entered a VR simulation of my college iTunes playlists. I needed to know: How the hell did Hustlers pull this all off?\n\nScafaria tells me that the cameo was written into the script all the way back in 2016, before the film went into development. Back then, she doubted she\u2019d ever be able to get Usher. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things when you write something in and then you go, \u2018Yeah, okay, but when we get there, who\u2019s it actually going to be?\u2019\u201d Then the team cast Lopez, producer Jessica Elbaum explains, and all of their possibilities widened. \u201cPeople like Jennifer and [record executive] Benny Medina helped a lot with connecting,\u201d Scafaria says of the casting, but ultimately, it was up to her to convince Usher to traipse back into the club.\n\n\u201cIt was, at first, assuring him that what the scene represents is a celebration. The glory days,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I remember the hardest part was convincing him that his hair was going to be okay.\u201d Sure, Usher\u2019s face has remained eerily steady over the years, but he\u2019s since grown out his close-cut aughts hair. The solution: put a hat on him. \u201cThe day I was sending Usher pictures of himself in hats was a very funny day,\u201d says Scafaria. \u201cI was just Googling \u2018Usher in hats\u2019 and telling him, \u2018I swear we could do this part with that hat.\u2019\u201d\n\nUltimately, Usher agreed to a hat, as long as he could pair it with his own wardrobe from 2008: a necklace, jacket, and sunglasses. \u201cIt was rad,\u201d says Scafaria. As for his iconic line? The writer-director says it was totally improvised. \u201cI told Usher, \u2018If you want to say something, let\u2019s talk about it.\u2019 Usher came up to me after we did one take, and he goes, \u2018I\u2019ve thought about what I wanted to say. I wanted her to ask my name, and I\u2019m going to say \u2018Usher, baby.\u2019\u201d Scafaria was totally delighted. \u201cI was like, \u2018Hell yeah!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe cameo was shot in a single day in the summer of 2019 at Show Palace in Queens, during the last week of Hustlers\u2019 filming. \u201cWe had Usher, Lizzo, and Cardi all filming the same day,\u201d says producer Jessica Elbaum. \u201cThat was insane. Cameos are challenging schedule-wise, but I\u2019ve never done it with three people in one day.\u201d The most difficult part was figuring out how to film the mega-cameo in the middle of New York with hundreds of extras \u2014 and to keep it all a secret until release. Before Scafaria began shooting, producer Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas stood up to plead with the background actors. \u201cI said, \u2018Guys, listen, we\u2019re making a movie,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re a part of our movie, so you can\u2019t post anything \u2026 nobody can know we\u2019re here.\u2019\u201d\n\nConstance Wu and Jennifer Lopez in Hustlers. Photo: STXfilms\n\nAt the time, Goldsmith-Thomas says she was distracted by the sorts of producer worries that keep you up at night \u2014 especially when you\u2019ve only got 29 days to shoot a massive feature film: \u201cI didn\u2019t know how Lorene was going to block it. I had just been consumed with, \u2018Did everybody get off the plane? Did we have time to fit the costumes? Oh my God, are we going to be late?\u2019\u201d But once \u201cLove in This Club\u201d began playing on set, she says, \u201ceveryone was transported.\u201d \u201cOh my god, there\u2019s Usher, and he\u2019s picking Jennifer up, and he\u2019s carrying her, and Constance is all over Lizzo,\u201d she recalls thinking. \u201cI\u2019ve never had that experience on a set. I looked at Jessica and I said, \u2018Jesus, this is good.\u2019 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that it was really him was remarkable,\u201d confirms Scafaria. \u201cThe girls were flipping out. I think he was a crush for everybody at some point in their lives.\u201d\n\nWu confirmed as much: \u201cThe second he smiles, everybody just melts.\u201d In fact, Jacq the Stripper, a comedian and dancer who has a role in the film but also acted as an on-set \u201ccomfort consultant\u201d for the cast, remembers having to remind the actresses to play it cool. \u201cI was like, \u2018Don\u2019t be too thirsty, just \u2019cause Usher just walked in. Strippers do not give them everything. You have to be like, \u2018He ain\u2019t shit,\u2019 because that\u2019s what keeps them wanting more.\u201d\n\nFor Palmer, who auditioned for the 2005 Usher rom-com In the Mix when she was 10 years old, the experience was particularly surreal. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Man, the last time I seen you, you was a kid.\u2019 I said, \u2018Yeah \u2026 a lot has changed since then,\u2019\u201d Palmer says. \u201cIt was really funny \u2014 like, \u2018Now I\u2019m stripping for you, Usher?\u2019 He and I were laughing about that.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the extras must have agreed to play along with Goldsmith-Thomas\u2019s decrees, because the producer says not a single person leaked the surprise. \u201cThey all took such pride in it, and they were our partners. They knew how hard it was to do it,\u201d she says. Scafaria was moved to tears by the result: \u201cIt just felt like a Renaissance painting or something. It was so beautiful.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s possible that nobody found the whole thing more magical than Usher himself. \u201cI think he had a good time,\u201d says Scafaria, laughing. \u201cI had a text the next day that said, \u2018I hope you had as much fun as I did.\u2019\u201d", "description": "How the film\u2019s producers (and Jennifer Lopez) convinced a music superstar to show up in Hustlers \u2014 and 200 extras to stay quiet while it happened.", "authors": ["Rachel Handler"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/13/13-how-it-works-hustlers-cameo.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
