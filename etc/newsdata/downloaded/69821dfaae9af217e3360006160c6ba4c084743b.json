Her replacement has yet to be named.\n\n\n\nSarkar is leaving her role as Windows Insider chief and joining Microsoft's Developer Realations team to work on \"citizen developer\" advocacy. That job will largely focus on the Power Platform, which is Microsoft's collection of Flow, PowerApps and Power BI tools.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft is currently looking for a new Windows Insider chief, according to an October 7 blog post. In June 2016, Sarkar became Microsoft's second Windows Insider chief, following Gabe Aul, who recently joined Facebook as Vice President of Virtual Reality Engineering.\n\nSarkar recently said that Microsoft has 17 million people signed up as Insiders, though the number testing builds regularly is believed to be significantly smaller.\n\n\n\nThe change in Insider chiefs comes at a time when Microsoft should be just about done finalizing Windows 10 1909, its Windows 10 19H2 feature update. The next Insider chief will take up the mantle mid-stream during Windows 10 20H1 testing and just ahead of the start of the testing of the next Windows 10 feature update, which will be codenamed \"Manganese.\"", "description": "Microsoft is on a hunt for a new head for its Windows Insider test program, as Dona Sarkar takes a new position focused on advocacy for Microsoft's Power Platform.", "authors": ["Mary Jo Foley"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/07/2e46c38b-fdae-467f-b23a-aa9b6185fcbb/thumbnail/770x578/c86a7d22f6ba64e7213a1d6d159ee0e1/donasarkarnewjob.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
