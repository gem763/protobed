But in real life, that\u2019s rare.\n\nWe\u2019ll go into this in a bit of detail, but here\u2019s the \u201cexecutive summary\u201d of three main points I\u2019ll argue.\n\n\u2022 If you take out what you need every year and adjust that figure for inflation, you are likely to do fine for a few years no matter what happens. But a string of high-inflation years could make it impossible to continue this for the long haul.\n\n\u2022 If you take out only what your portfolio can \u201cafford\u201d to pay you, you could have to tighten your belt, especially if you run into inflation and poor market returns in the early years of your retirement.\n\n\u2022 If you begin your retirement with ample savings, you are likely to avoid these problems.\n\nIn order for me to show how this works, let\u2019s start with a few definitions and assumptions.\n\nIn the following scenarios, I will assume you retire with $1 million and you\u2019ve determined that you need $50,000 from your portfolio to meet your needs that first year.\n\nIn this case, what you need and what your portfolio can afford to pay you (if you accept a 5% withdrawal rate as affordable) are the same: $50,000.\n\nSo in your first blissful year of retirement, things are fine for you financially. You ask yourself: What could go wrong?\n\nIn the world of investing, there\u2019s always an answer to that question!\n\nOne possible answer is that the stock market could choose your first year (or years) of retirement to go into a dive. If you increase your withdrawals every year to keep up with inflation, you likely won\u2019t feel any pain from poor market conditions \u2014 at least not right away. But if on the other hand you have decided to live on 5% annual withdrawals, you will have to reduce your spending.\n\nSee: How fees can eat up your life savings\n\nI\u2019ll show you how this would have played out in a few tables that use actual market returns and actual inflation starting in 1970. I will assume the portfolio was split evenly between the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.09% and five-year government bonds.\n\nThis first table shows the first 10 years of your retirement if you took out $50,000 in 1970 and adjusted the amount upward each year for actual inflation.\n\nTable 1: The first 10 years, fixed withdrawals\n\nYear Starting portfolio balance Withdrawal 1970 $1,000,000 $50,000 1971 $1,041,644 $52,741 1972 $1,099,229 $54,513 1973 $1,066,559 $56,378 1974 $1,050,891 $61,325 1975 $886,718 $68,807 1976 $997,868 $73,633 1977 $1,079,230 $77,184 1978 $980,752 $82,409 1979 $941,616 $89,852\n\nIf you were the one getting those \u201cpayments\u201d from your portfolio every year, you might be happy that you didn\u2019t have to tighten your belt.\n\nBut notice two things:\n\n\u2022 The annual distributions went up dramatically, the result of steep inflation.\n\n\u2022 In 1979, you were taking out roughly 9.5% of your portfolio, a depletion rate that could not be sustainable forever.\n\nThe next table shows how you would have fared if your annual withdrawals were based strictly on what your portfolio could afford to pay you each year: 5% of the beginning balance.\n\nTable 2: The first 10 years, flexible withdrawals\n\nYear Starting portfolio balance Withdrawal 1970 $1,000,000 $50,000 1971 $1,041,644 $52,082 1972 $1,099,962 $54,998 1973 $1,166,835 $58,342 1974 $1,049,294 $52,465 1975 $893,227 $44,661 1976 $1,035,267 $51,763 1977 $1,148,435 $57,422 1978 $1,067831 $53,392 1979 $1,138,538 $53,165\n\nThese annual payments were just fine for a few years. But starting in 1974, you had to do some belt-tightening. In 1975 if you truly needed $50,000 for living expenses, even ignoring inflation you were in trouble.\n\nRead: These are the best new ideas in retirement\n\nWhat happened later\n\nSubsequent years aren\u2019t shown here, but under this plan you would not have regained your 1973 spending level of $58,342 until 1981.\n\nEven then, your withdrawals would have been far below the inflation-adjusted value of your first-year retirement income of $50,000.\n\nWith fixed distributions (table 1), you had plenty to spend, but you were seriously eroding your portfolio\u2019s ability to keep meeting your needs.\n\nIndeed, 10 years later, in 1989, you took $160,012 from a portfolio that started the year worth $844,772. That withdrawal rate was unsustainable, and in fact that portfolio ran completely out of money sometime in 1994.\n\nWith the flexible 5% distributions, your portfolio was healthy. But you paid a high price in the 1970s, failing to keep up with inflation.\n\nIn fact, that flexible distribution didn\u2019t catch up to be worth its inflation-adjusted 1970 value until 1997. In other words, for the first 26 years of retirement, flexible distributions forced you to adapt to a lower standard of living than you had in your first year of retirement.\n\nNeither of these outcomes is good. But there is a third path that will let you keep your portfolio healthy and have enough to live on. If that sounds too good to be true, I will tell you that there is a catch: Before you retire, you will need to have more money saved up.\n\nYou can do that by working longer (postponing retirement). You might be able to do that by taking a second (part-time) job and saving all the income from it. However you accomplish this, the rewards can be great from saving more before retirement.\n\nIn the following table, I assume you retired in 1970 with $1.5 million instead of $1 million, and you could meet your essential cost of living with $50,000.\n\nTable 3: The first 10 years, flexible withdrawals and ample savings\n\nYear Starting portfolio balance Withdrawal 1970 $1,500,000 $75,000 1971 $1,562,466 $78,123 1972 $1,649,943 $82,497 1973 $1,750252 $87,513 1974 $1,573,941 $78,698 1975 $1,339,841 $66,992 1976 $1,552,901 $77,645 1977 $1,722,653 $86,133 1978 $1,601,747 $80,088 1979 $1,707,807 $79,748\n\nThis scenario presents the best of all worlds. Your portfolio is ample. Your spending is well above your rock-bottom needs. And you have enough cushion to take money out for extras once in a while.\n\nIf you\u2019re retired already or just about to retire and thus don\u2019t have time to add significantly to your savings, your best bet may be to find ways to keep your spending under control.\n\nFor more on this topic, check out my latest podcast, \u201cFlexible distributions, the ultimate retirement strategy.\u201d\n\nRichard Buck contributed to this article.", "description": "Should you take fixed distributions or variable distributions?", "authors": ["Paul A.
