She showed the baker a picture of a similar cake and handed over $300 (\u00a3245.51) a month before her big day.\n\nWhen she checked in on the cake in the runup to the wedding, Rena was assured that everything was going \u2018to plan\u2019.\n\nThe peacock wedding cake, made by Iced Two Perfection, that Rena showed the baker (Picture: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nThen the night before her wedding came. The baker dropped off the cake and as they drove away, one of the decorative birds on the cake had its head fall off. Rena also noticed at this point that the fondant icing she had asked for was actually buttercream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll in all, the cake didn\u2019t look quite like the one Rena had dreamed of.\n\nRena\u2019s sister-in-law shared a photo of the cake on Facebook, writing: \u2018The one \u2018peacock\u2019 looks like a turkey with leprosy or something, and the white bird, which isn\u2019t white at all, doesn\u2019t even have a tail or look like a bird in any way, it\u2019s just a brown BLOB!\n\n\u2018There\u2019s NOTHING supporting the \u2018birds\u2019 and the cake was already sinking so bad from their weight when it was delivered and it continued to sink worse overnight until the next morning, the day of the wedding, the birds were almost sitting on the bottom layer.\n\nThe cake that was delivered (Picture: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\u2018So, on the morning of her wedding, the bride was going from store to store trying to find a cake that would be suitable to use for her wedding.\u2019\n\nRena asked for a refund but claims she was immediately refused, so the baker returned \u2018with a box of Rice Krispies\u2019 to try to rebuild the animal.\n\nThe cake maker even claimed the fondant icing \u2018kept getting bubbles in it\u2019.\n\nRena said: \u2018[The baker] had made a cake for my best friend one time. Since then, she had supposedly finished baking school in town.\n\n\u2018First off we sent her a picture via text and she said she could make the cake.\n\n\u2018I called her and we agreed she would make the cake in a heart shape, and instead of one peacock she would make two.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She came the night before the wedding. She set it up on the table and all the time, I\u2019m looking at this cake, thinking \u2018really, are you serious?\u2019\n\nAs the baker drove away, the bird\u2019s head fell off (Picture: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\u2018I just walked out of the room. I had nothing else to say to her.\n\n\u2018Five minutes after she\u2019d left, one of the peacocks\u2019 heads had fallen off. I text her and asked for my money back, but she said she\u2019d think what she could do.\n\n\u2018The next few minutes she shows up at my house with a box of Rice Krispies. The peacocks were supposed to be fondant too, but I don\u2019t know what she had on them.\n\n\u2018I text her when she left to say the cake was not how it was supposed to be\u2026 It wasn\u2019t fondant, it was buttercream, and it wasn\u2019t the colours I wanted.\n\n\u2018She said \u2018well, I couldn\u2019t get the fondant to do right \u2013 it kept getting bubbles in it\u2019.\n\n\u2018I thought, well at least call me? Never once did I get a call. Everything was always going according to plan and she maintained it\u2019d be there the night before the wedding.\u2019\n\nAfter the social media post started getting loads of shares, Rena says she received a refund of cash in her letterbox.\n\nGena, from Griffin, in Georgia, US, said: \u2018I felt heartbroken. I saw [the cake] and walked out of the room.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It was a lop-sided mess \u2013 nothing like I thought it would be like.\n\n\u2018[Before yesterday], we\u2019d heard nothing from her since. She had not called or anything.\n\n\u2018The only reason she gave a refund now was because of the viral post. She said she couldn\u2019t give me my money back at first because she had 50 hours in it and she had to pay her mom for helping.\u2019\n\nRena and husband Dennis had to make do with a supermarket cake on the big day (Picture: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nThe cake sat in Rena\u2019s fridge for three days until after the wedding, when she threw it in the bin.\n\nRena said: \u2018The cake sat here for three days and she didn\u2019t come and get it.\n\n\u2018When Dennis took the cake out and my grandson held the bin liner out, it hit the floor like a brick. It was so heavy \u2013 there was no way anybody could have eaten that cake.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t even taste it. I was too angry. I didn\u2019t want anything to do with it.\n\n\u2018I was forced to call around on the morning of my wedding. No one had any cakes they could fix for me.\n\n\u2018I went to Walmart and got two cakes. One had purple and green flowers on it, so I got that one, then a triple chocolate one and put a tractor on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018On the white cake, I got some love hearts from Hobby Lobby.\n\n\u2018If she had called me when the fondant wasn\u2019t acting right, I would have had time to get a new cake.\n\n\u2018Overall, after I went and got the cake and that taken care of, the day was really good.\u2019\n\nDo you have a wedding story to share?
