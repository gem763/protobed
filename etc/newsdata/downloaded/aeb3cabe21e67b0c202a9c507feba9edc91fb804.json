Other times they would go to check even when the description of the dog didn\u2019t sound quite right.\n\n\u201cIn our heart, I would always say, \u2018If I didn\u2019t follow up, what if that was her and we didn\u2019t do anything?\u201d Ms. King said.\n\nSometimes it would turn out be a different dog. On one occasion, while they were talking to a landowner at a farm, a woman came up to them and said she had just seen their dog cross the road and run into a canola field. The Kings set off running, calling for Katie.\n\nThey didn\u2019t find her.\n\nDay 37\n\nQuitting Her Job\n\nMs. King was still working as a postal carrier back in the Spokane area. For a week in August, she had to return home while her husband continued the search.\n\nShe talked with her bosses about taking some time off. But that wasn\u2019t feasible during summer months. Though the money had helped supplement their pensions, she gave her notice.\n\n\u201cKatie was just more important to me,\u201d Ms. King said. \u201cI just said, \u2018I\u2019ll finish this week, and that\u2019s it.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen she returned to Kalispell, Mr. King had to return to Spokane.
