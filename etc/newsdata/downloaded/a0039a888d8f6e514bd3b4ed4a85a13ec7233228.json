But it\u2019s a whole other thing when a series like Watchmen gets near-uniform critical praise, with some going so far as to call it \u201cone of the best pilots ever,\u201d and earns a 98 percent fresh score from professional critics on Rotten Tomatoes, yet the site\u2019s audience score comes in at less than half that, at 45 percent rotten.\n\nIt appears that Watchmen is the latest target of something called \u201creview bombing,\u201d in which trolls and agenda-driven users flood a forum like Rotten Tomatoes or IMDb with one-star reviews in order to drain its ratings score and create the illusion that it\u2019s hated or unpopular.\n\n(The starkest, most recent example of this was Batwoman, which was review bombed before the series even premiered by trolls angry that the CW\u2019s version of the character, played by Ruby Rose, is a lesbian, which they ruled a liberal-tinged affront to their precious Gotham canon. Proof that outsized outrage can come from both sides, the series was also the target of a left-wing harassment campaign over LGBT identity politics.)\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Daily Beast\u2019s Obsessed Everything we can\u2019t stop loving, hating, and thinking about this week in pop culture.

This isn\u2019t Watchmen, it\u2019s Wokemen, sorry, Wokepersons.\u201d\n\nThe series\u2019 treatment of Rorschach is a particularly triggering catalyst in this campaign. The events of creator Damon Lindelof\u2019s series take place in the modern day, decades after the graphic novel concludes. In this present day alt-history, the character of Rorschach, who dies near the end of the comic, has become a symbol of white supremacy, with racist, anti-police vigilantes sporting versions of his ink-blot mask to conceal their faces.\n\nThis upset a legion of the comic\u2019s fans who view Rorschach as a hero, not a fetish object of the alt-right. This is despite the fact that, in the source material, Rorschach is \u201coutwardly (checks list) racist, homophobic, sexist, and a total and complete fascist,\u201d as Princess Weekes points out in The Mary Sue, reminding us that Moore wrote him to \u201cmake fun of The Question, Mr. A, and a bunch of other Steve Ditko comic characters that the artist/writer used to promote his Ayn Randian ideals.\u201d\n\nThat Rorschach would be lionized by some fans of the comics even disturbed Moore, who has explicitly stated that he didn\u2019t intend for him to be considered a hero.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make this like, \u2018Yeah, this is what Batman would be in the real world,\u2019\u201d he said in a 2008 interview. \u201cBut I had forgotten that actually to a lot of comic fans that smelling, not having girlfriend\u2014these are actually kind of heroic. So actually, sort of, Rorschach became the most popular character in Watchmen. I meant him to be a bad example, but I have people come up to me in the street saying, \u2018I am Rorschach! That is my story!\u2019 And I\u2019ll be thinking, \u2018Yeah, great, can you just keep away from me and never come anywhere near me again as long as I live?\u2019\u201d\n\nDave Gibbons, the artist who worked with Moore on Watchmen, has said something similar about Rorschach. In 2008, he told Digital Spy, \u201cI put him in the same kind of bag as Hitler and Margaret Thatcher\u2014you might not like them but you can\u2019t deny that there\u2019s something very attractive about someone who has no grey areas.\u201d\n\nSo on the one hand, those posting memes claiming that \u201cRorschach is a hero and not a symbol for white supremacy\u201d and blasting Lindelof for destroying Moore\u2019s legacy aren\u2019t exactly correct.\n\nBut other fans of the source material defend Lindelof\u2019s imagining of how Watchmen\u2019s alternative history would have progressed into the present day. They argue that the idea that Rorschach and his legacy would have been embraced by white supremacist groups and the alt-right is very much in line with Moore\u2019s universe and Watchmen\u2019s themes. (Moore pointedly refused any involvement with the HBO series.)\n\nTake two of the major race-related elements of Sunday\u2019s series premiere. The show opens with a dramatization of the 1921 Tulsa massacre in which as many as 300 black Americans were killed, an event that history books have ignored so egregiously, many viewers had no idea it was real. (Without spoiling anything, rest assured that the massacre continues to figure into the Watchmen plot in future episodes.) There has also been the introduction of reparations for black Americans, nicknamed \u201cRedfordations\u201d after Robert Redford, who has become president in the show.\n\n\u201cWatchmen has always been about taking the idea of superheroes to its natural conclusion with the events in world history,\u201d writes Weekes in that Mary Sue piece. In that context, reparations makes sense in the series.\n\n\u201cWith the presidency something you can do for unlimited terms in the world of Watchmen, a president, especially a popular one, could tackle that kind of legislation,\u201d she writes. \u201cIn a place like Tulsa, which has always had a racial divide and dark history of white inhabitants being antagonistic when their Black counterparts make it, this just seems like the natural conclusion\u2014especially when Rorschach\u2019s journals were shared with the equivalent of Breitbart News. These white supremacists are the logical conclusion to his rhetoric.\u201d\n\nLogical and reasoned or not, that hasn\u2019t quelled the vitriolic reaction to the show.\n\nThe Reddit forum \u201cr/Fuckthealtright\u201d has curated some of the iMDB reactions. One reads, \u201cIf you want to make a racial/political show, create your own universe don\u2019t pollute Watchmen. Another example of a liberal woke show with no real substance.\u201d Another review titled \u201cMore PC globalist propaganda\u201d complains, \u201cThe agenda was evident in even in the trailer [sic]. Why do they feel the need to make all the white characters protagonists and the black characters saviours.\u201d\n\nYouTuber \u201cWeaponized Nerd Rage\u201d is among those who have taken to that site to vent, in this case in an 11-minute video titled \u201cSJW Watchmen Trailer Looks Like Straight Garbage\u201d that has amassed over 70,000 views. Based on the show\u2019s trailer alone, the video condemns \u201cthe typical schlock that we hear from the SJW entertainment industry.\u201d The 1,700 comments on the video are about what you would imagine: \u201cSurprised they haven\u2019t demanded for it to be called Watchwomen yet.\u201d \u201cLooks like \u2018Antifa Propaganda\u2019 to me.\u201d And, \u201cThe SJWs are ruining everything. But, it will pass. After a few years there won't be anything left for them to ruin. Then society and pop culture can get back to normal.\u201d\n\nIt is of course neither accurate nor fair to equate anyone who has a criticism of the new Watchmen series, or disagrees with its political perspective, or who thought of Rorschach as a hero as a white supremacist themselves. But the correlation is certainly present, and predictable.", "description": "The series has been \u201creview bombed\u201d and blasted on social media for \u201crace-baiting\u201d and making a popular character a symbol of white supremacy.
