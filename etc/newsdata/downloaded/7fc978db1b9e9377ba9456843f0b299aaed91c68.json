For one thing, they have managed to ruin travel. Completely and utterly squash it into a new and unappealing shape.\n\nHere are the 10 reasons why\u2026\n\n1. A loss of mystique...\n\nOnce upon a time, the world was an unknown concept. Or much of it was. Great swathes of it were unseen by tourists. And even if someone had been to, for example, the north of Mongolia, you could guarantee that they hadn't taken 475 photos of it, and posted them to Instagram.\n\nNow, every phone comes fitted with a camera 100 times more powerful than anything Russia used for spying in the Cold War, and you can't move on the internet for images of the supposedly niche destination you are \u201cdiscovering\u201d next month. Even if it's Uzbekistan. (Although \u2013 to be fair \u2013 there are good reasons for documenting Uzbekistan).\n\n2. ...and loss of dignity\n\nIt\u2019s not just that we all travel with our phones at all times. It\u2019s that we take them out and snap photos of everything we encounter. Which is all very well. But it does reduce even the most special occasions to a series of gurning mugshots. Imagine if this were still the first era of polar exploration.\n\nBack in 1911, Norwegian daredevil Roald Amundsen (and his team) became the first man to reach 90\u00b0S. He marked the moment with a stiff photo of his band of brothers, and a short, formal note for his beaten British rival Robert Scott.\n\n#AntarcticaSmashedIt Credit: GETTY\n\nHad this taken place today, we would be drowning in \u201chilarious\u201d Snapchats of Roald and \u201cthe lads\u201d doing topless belly slides along the ice, bearing the hashtag #AntarcticaSmashedIt.\n\n3. Other people\u2019s nervousness\u2026\n\nHas the digital age made us more relaxed, knowing that all the information we need is at our fingertips? Or do we now seek constant reassurance? Twenty years ago, you only worried about a plane going down if there were a newsflash during Eastenders.\n\nNow, you are obliged to text half your family within 30 seconds of landing on Tenerife, otherwise they will start harassing Interpol. Of course the 737 has touched down. It\u2019s what 737s do.\n\n4. \u2026and the same conversations on a loop\n\nWhere once, an aeroplane in the 20 minutes before take-off was a happy haven of people reading magazines, now it is an echo chamber where the following words bounce back and forth.\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m on the plane. No, it\u2019s not full/Yes, it\u2019s very full indeed.Yes, I\u2019ll try to sleep/No, there\u2019s no chance of me sleeping, there\u2019s a rotund gentleman in the seat next to me, and his bulbous leg is squeezing under the arm rest. I love you too/I don\u2019t love you anymore and I\u2019m leaving you for your sister.\u201d\n\nA million monkeys at a million typewriters might eventually write the works of Shakespeare, but they surely couldn\u2019t come up with anything quite as brain-numbingly banal as the chat issuing from the salesman in seat 4D.\n\n5. The selfie\n\nHave you seen the Statue of Liberty/Christ The Redeemer/the Eiffel Tower? All fabulous moments of engineering and creativity. The only thing that could make them better is an entire Italian school group standing in front taking infantile photos with phones on sticks.\n\nGet a grip Credit: getty\n\n6. Never getting lost\n\nOne of the joys of travel is the happy accident, the wrong turn which leads to that little caf\u00e9, that tiny art gallery, that restaurant that only locals know about. There is a delight to the unexpected, to not knowing where we are. Except that now, we always know where we are. \u201cWe\u2019re lost\u201d. \u201cNo we\u2019re not. My phone has GPS. Shall we go to Burger King?\u201d\n\n7. Enormous unquestioned bills\n\nTwo decades ago, phone bills were little footnotes which came as a minor cost of having a landline. Now, step outside the EU for more than 10 minutes, check a couple of e-mails, and suddenly \u00a380 has disappeared from your bank account by direct debit.\n\nDo we stamp our feet about this? Do we protest? Or do we shrug, mutter about data roaming, and ignore the fact that enough money to put the kids through private school vanishes every time we leave Europe. Not a good private school, admittedly. One with no windows and a questionable safety record. But that\u2019s isn\u2019t really the point.\n\n8. Punctuality\n\nWhat did we do before we had mobile phones which let us to text our friends to say: \u201cReally sorry, we\u2019re running 27 minutes late, because the cat has tooth ache\u201d? We made firm, immoveable plans with specific times and locations, and stuck to them. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m going to be 43-and-a-half minutes late now. The dog has lost its house key or something.\u201d\n\n9. Failure to switch off\n\n\u201cLook at that incredible sunset, darling. I\u2019m so glad we came here. It\u2019s one of the most amazing things I\u2019ve ever seen. So many pinks, reds, yellows, oranges. I really love you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, what was that, dear? Smoggy just sent me a brilliant mpeg of a farting dolphin.\u201d\n\n10. The end of everything\n\nHoliday preparations, 1986: \u201cI have the flight tickets, and the hotel booking details, and a receipt for all of it. The travel agent sent it in the post. In triplicate. We\u2019re good to go.\u201d\n\nHoliday preparations, 2019: \u201cIt\u2019s all on my phone. I have lost my phone.
