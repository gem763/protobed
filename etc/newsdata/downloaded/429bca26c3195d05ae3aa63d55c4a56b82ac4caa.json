City of Chicago), a Seventh Circuit panel ruled that Chicago\u2019s \u201cbubble zone\u201d ordinance, which (in the panel\u2019s summary) \u201cprohibit[s] any person from approaching within eight feet of another person near an abortion clinic for the purpose of engaging in the type of speech associated with sidewalk counseling,\u201d is permissible under the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Hill v. Colorado (2000). As the panel explains, the Chicago ordinance is indistinguishable from the Colorado law that the Court allowed in Hill.\n\nThe Court\u2019s ruling in Hill was widely regarded as egregious when it was rendered\u2014Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe called the case \u201cslam-dunk simple and slam-dunk wrong\u201d\u2014and it has fared very poorly over the years. As the panel explains, recent Supreme Court rulings \u201chave deeply shaken Hill\u2019s foundation,\u201d and Hill \u201cis incompatible with current First Amendment doctrine.\u201d Nonetheless, Hill \u201cremains on the books and directly controls here.\u201d More broadly:\n\nThe [Supreme] Court\u2019s instructions in this situation are clear: \u201cIf a precedent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case [that] directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.\u201d Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237\u201338 (1997) (quotation marks omitted).\n\n(If these \u201cinstructions\u201d seem at all surprising, that is probably only because so many lower courts that ruled against state marriage laws in the years before Obergefell v. Hodges made up all sorts of weak excuses why intervening Court rulings meant that the Court\u2019s directly applicable precedent in Baker v. Nelson (1972) somehow no longer governed.)\n\nMuch as I dislike the result in the case, I think that the esteemed panel\u2014opinion by Diane Sykes, joined by Amy Coney Barrett and district judge William Griesbach\u2014faithfully applied the Court\u2019s instructions.* The Court should grant review in this case to correct its grievous error in Hill.\n\nBoth Sykes and Barrett, I\u2019ll note, are on President Trump\u2019s list of Supreme Court candidates, and Barrett was maligned during her 2017 confirmation process by those, like Senator Dianne (\u201cThe dogma lives loudly within you\u201d) Feinstein, who baselessly claimed that she would indulge her Catholic faith and her putative pro-life convictions in deciding cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n* Per this post by Michael Paulsen, I will allow for the possibility of exceptional circumstances in which a lower court may defy governing Supreme Court precedent.
