REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe declines were broad-based, with all the major S&P 500 sectors trading lower and 28 of the 30 components of the blue-chip Dow Jones index in negative territory.\n\nAdding to the pessimism was a South China Morning Post report that said China had toned down expectations ahead of the talks set to begin on Thursday and that the Chinese delegation could depart Washington a day earlier than planned.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s really much hope that we are going to see a completed deal any time soon,\u201d said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. \u201cFor markets, it may be enough to just see a stop in the escalation.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. widened its trade blacklist to include Chinese video surveillance firm Hikvision (002415.SZ) and surveillance equipment maker Zhejiang Dahua Technology (002236.SZ) among others, drawing a sharp rebuke from Beijing.\n\nThis pressured U.S. suppliers, with Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) falling about 1%. Ambarella Inc (AMBA.O) slumped 12%.\n\nThe Philadelphia Semiconductor index .SOX declined 2.3%, while technology stocks .SPLRCT dropped 1.2%.\n\nWeighing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was a 1.5% fall in shares of Boeing Co (BA.N).\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported friction between the United States and Europe could further delay efforts to resume flights of the planemaker\u2019s best-selling 737 MAX jets, which have been grounded since early 2019.\n\nInvestors fled to the perceived safety of gold and government debt. Gold prices rose nearly 1%, while yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury dropped.\n\nAt 9:50 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 264.98 points, or 1.00%, at 26,213.04, while the S&P 500 .SPX was down 33.40 points, or 1.14%, at 2,905.39. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 90.11 points, or 1.13%, at 7,866.19.\n\nMarket participants will now focus on third-quarter earnings season beginning next week and analysts expect the worst quarterly profit performance since 2016, with earnings from S&P 500 companies declining nearly 3% from a year earlier, based on IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ.N) dropped 3.5% after the pizza chain missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly same-store sales and profit.\n\nU.S.-listed Chinese stocks also declined, with Alibaba Group Holding (BABA.N), JD.com Inc (JD.O) and Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) falling between 2.7% and 3%.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 4.14-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 4.08-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded one new 52-week highs and 10 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded five new highs and 60 new lows.", "description": "U.S. stocks fell more than 1% on Tuesday as sentiment soured ahead of high-level trade talks after a report the Trump administration was moving ahead with efforts to limit capital flows into China and the inclusion of more Chinese firms in a blacklist.", "authors": ["Shreyashi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438473543&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970SF", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
