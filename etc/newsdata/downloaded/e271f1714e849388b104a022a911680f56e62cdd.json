The program has been gradually rolled out on a state-by-state basis over the last 14 years, but hasn\u2019t yet been federally mandated for all states. That will change a year from now.\n\nThe law establishes a new set of minimum security standards for state-issued driver\u2019s licenses and ID cards \u2014 based on a recommendation by the 9/11 Commission in 2004. Beginning next October, travelers will not be able to board any domestic flight without an upgraded Real ID card \u2014 denoted by a star in the upper right corner.\n\n\u201cThis is an important step in enhancing commercial aviation security as we urge travelers to ensure they have compliant documents,\u201d Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan said this month. \u201cDHS is committed to states as they continue their efforts to issue Real IDs to Americans.\u201d\n\nIn addition to state-issued identification, U.S. passengers will also be allowed to fly if they present another acceptable document \u2014 including a valid passport, passport card, U.S. military card or DHS trusted traveler card.\n\nAs of Wednesday, 47 states are compliant with the law \u2014 meaning they offer licenses and ID cards that are sufficient for air travel. However, only a little more than a quarter of Americans have been issued a Real ID as of Oct. 1. Also, a recent study by the U.S. Travel Association found that 39 percent \u2014 about 100 million people \u2014 said they do not have any acceptable form of identification that will allow them to fly next October.\n\nBased on that data, 78,500 air travelers would be turned away at airport security checkpoints today if the law was in effect. Experts say that figure could grow to 549,500 in the first week of October 2020.\n\n\u201cLook at Thanksgiving of 2020 when you\u2019ve got the infrequent fliers that are trying to go see family for a holiday and they\u2019re just not able to get there because they\u2019re turned away,\u201d U.S. Travel Association spokeswoman Tori Emerson Barnes said.\n\nBarnes said part of the reason why so few Americans are compliant is because each state decided on its own strategy to distribute the new IDs. Some states immediately began implementing the program, while others did not.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got 50 states, plus D.C. and the territories all needing to issue Real IDs in the ways that they find appropriate,\u201d Barnes added. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lack of consistency in the way that the implementation has moved forward.\u201d\n\nFor example in August, Maryland recalled 8,000 compliant cards because they did not meet federal standards. Oregon and Oklahoma have not begun issuing Real IDs and New Jersey is producing them at just two locations statewide.\n\nThe process also requires residents to physically report to their state DMV and provide documents such as a birth certificate or Certificate of Citizenship to establish their identity, meaning people with older IDs who are accustomed to renewing online may not receive their compliant identification.\n\nThe U.S. Travel Organization recommends all adults check with their state motor vehicles department to ensure their identification is acceptable come next fall. It also suggests the federal law be amended to allow mobile and web-based applications \u2014 and automatic compliance among travelers who are PreCheck- and CLEAR-certified. Those cleared to participate in PreCheck and CLEAR undergo repeated background checks and submit biometric data to DHS.\n\n\u201cWe feel that biometrics really are your real ID so for folks that are comfortable opting in to using that technology, which many are, we think that that\u2019s one way to alleviate what would otherwise be hysteria at the airports,\u201d said Barnes.", "description": "Oct. 30 (UPI) \u2014 A major security change at U.S. airports that can prevent passengers from boarding their flights is now less than a year away.
