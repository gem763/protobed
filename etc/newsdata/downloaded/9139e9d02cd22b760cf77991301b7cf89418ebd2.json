Rookie Devlin \u201cDuck\u201d Hodges filled in nicely for Rudolph during a 24-17 win over the Los Angeles Chargers last week, but Tomlin didn\u2019t hesitate when asked if Rudolph will play once he\u2019s available.\n\n\u201c(Rudolph) is our quarterback when he clears the protocol and it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cAppreciate the efforts of \u2018Duck\u2019 and so forth, but as soon as (Rudolph) is ready to go, he\u2019s ready to go.\u201d\n\nRudolph left in the third quarter of an overtime loss to Baltimore on Oct. 6 when he was knocked unconscious after taking a shot to the head by Ravens safety Earl Thomas. He recovered in time to practice in a limited capacity next week but was inactive for the Steelers in Los Angeles. Pittsburgh is off this week and doesn\u2019t play again until hosting Miami on Monday, Oct. 28.\n\nTomlin said Rudolph is \u201cprogressing nicely,\u201d adding there is \u201cextreme urgency\u201d to get Rudolph fully out of the protocol because of the bye week. The Steelers cancelled practice on Wednesday to give players a jump start on their off time.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been fully cleared to participate in the things that we have been doing, he would have been a full participant had we chosen to work out today,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cSo it\u2019s probably semantics or whatever in terms of him getting cleared. But when he does we will inform you, and we won\u2019t speculate any further than what I just did.\u201d\n\nWhile the Steelers will be without defensive end Stephon Tuitt for the rest of the season after he tore a pectoral muscle against the Chargers, Pittsburgh figures to be relatively healthy when it returns to action. Wide receiver James Washington (shoulder), defensive back Steven Nelson (groin), fullback Rosie Nix (knee) and linebacker Mark Barron (hamstring) could be available to play against Miami. Running back Jaylen Samuels, who had knee surgery last week, is likely out until the middle of November.\n\nRunning back James Conner (quad), defensive back Joe Haden (groin) and linebacker T.J. Watt (abdomen) all sustained injuries against Los Angeles but are expected to be ready to face the Dolphins.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Looks like \"Duck Season\" will last just a week for the Pittsburgh Steelers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/steelers_chargers_football_87924_c0-105-2559-1597_s1200x700.jpg?4d5000aea245afe42bc1d9f59df2148386e4d5fa", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
