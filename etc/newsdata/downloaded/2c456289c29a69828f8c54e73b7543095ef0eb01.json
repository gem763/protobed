It is 35 years since he launched his airline, Virgin Atlantic, and Branson is contemplating his 70th birthday next year. While apparently he hasn\u2019t tired of hamming it up for the cameras, there is perhaps a little less spring in his step. But he remains Virgin\u2019s rock-star draw on the Tel Aviv trip.\n\nBrexit is a particular source of sadness. \u201cIt must have become apparent to most people in the last three-and-a-half years just what a mistake it was,\u201d Branson says. \u201cIn my ideal world there should be another referendum. If a soft Brexit happens, it won\u2019t bankrupt the country \u2013 but it will be very sad for young people, who won\u2019t be able to live or work in these beautiful countries.\u201d\n\nHe attributes Thomas Cook\u2019s demise directly to the Brexit vote, Monarch\u2019s likewise, \u201cand Flybe we picked up for a pound\u201d. A hard Brexit would do irreparable damage to Britain, he says, but those airlines had already suffered too much from the 20% drop in the value of the pound. \u201cAll their costs would have been in dollars \u2013 maintenance, leasing, fuel \u2013 and less people could travel overseas.\u201d\n\nVirgin Atlantic is another airline failing to make a profit, but it is not in danger, Branson says. \u201cWe are survivors. And it\u2019s got the advantage of other Virgin companies: if the worst comes to the worst we can help it out, occasionally.\u201d\n\nThe airline is now backed (or controlled, rivals say) by US giant Delta. \u201cNo question, Delta have been fantastic partners,\u201d says Branson, whose sale of his majority stake to Air France-KLM has yet to get full regulatory approval.\n\nExpansion to new routes has been off the agenda until recently, but now Virgin is planning on growth: back to Mumbai, adding S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, as well as the new Israel route. Sensitivities are such that cabin crew were sent for cultural awareness training among the Jewish community in Golders Green, north London. Last year, the airline took \u201cPalestinian couscous\u201d off the inflight menu. Branson says he wasn\u2019t aware of the couscous controversy, but \u201cif it was done for political reasons, I would say it was a mistake\u201d.\n\nDomestically, he remains animated by Virgin Atlantic\u2019s push to engage the old enemy, British Airways, at Heathrow. Branson and Virgin have informally aligned with the airport\u2019s management against BA to build the third runway and get more slots.\n\n\u201cOur team punch above its weight out of Heathrow but BA should have a competitor that has 35-40% [of slots] at least \u2026 We\u2019re going to fight our corner.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Virgin Galactic test flight in the Mojave desert last year. Photograph: Virgin Galactic/PA\n\nMeanwhile, the climate emergency has enveloped aviation. BA recently pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, and Branson says Virgin will do the same: \u201cWe have said we\u2019re going to go net zero by 2050, we\u2019ve been very clear, and I think we should try to make it less than that.\u201d (Virgin Atlantic\u2019s chief executive, Shai Weiss, is more coy: \u201cWe\u2019ve kind of said it.\u201d)\n\nIn Branson\u2019s view, \u201crealistically, people are not going to stop flying \u2013 the most avid of marchers are going to fly. What\u2019s critical is that we enable them to fly as environmentally friendly as possible.\u201d\n\nHe says there is a \u201cwhole list of things\u201d that Virgin is doing. \u201cI\u2019m lobbying to get government to impose the equivalent of a carbon tax on all companies in Britain, to have the companies invest 100% of that money directly into green energy investment.\u201d He has championed LanzaTech, \u201ca wonderful company that turn waste from aluminium and steel [processing] into aviation fuel. They need billions to build more factories.\u201d More modern planes are cutting Virgin\u2019s fuel burn by 25-30%. And, he adds, \u201cby the time we get those slots at Heathrow, hopefully some short-haul planes will be completely battery-driven\u201d.\n\nIs this wishful thinking? \u201cThey are not hypotheticals, it\u2019s just getting the quantity. We need to make sure we get the trillions and trillions needed to speed up the processes of all these things.\u201d\n\nHe remains resolutely positive: \u201cSome people think that every other problem apart from aviation in the world will be ticked, and aviation will never be ticked. I disagree: I think aviation can also be carbon neutral, and sooner than people realise.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, fresh adventures remain on planet Earth. Next month Branson will join the sea trials off Marseille of Virgin\u2019s first cruise ship, pitching his lone vessel to \u2013 once again \u2013 disrupt a market dominated by two or three big players.\n\nAnd his optimism remains undimmed. Next time you are in the US, he says, don\u2019t just hop over to the Mojave desert to see the Galactic set-up \u2013 \u201cstunning, beautiful rockets\u201d \u2013 but also go and see Hyperloop One \u2013 the magnetically propelled high-speed transport system being developed with the aim of moving people and things at airline speeds on the ground. Its test track in Nevada could be followed by a full-scale project in India, pending approval: \u201cWe\u2019ve got the first track we\u2019re building soon, between Mumbai to Pune.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to work.\u201d\n\nBranson\u2019s businesses\n\nVirgin Atlantic\n\nLaunched in 1984, the airline was successful for many years but has struggled recently. Branson cashed in by selling 49% to Singapore Airways for \u00a3600m in 1999 and in 2017 he agreed to sell 31% to Air France-KLM.\n\nVirgin Records\n\nThe young Branson founded his record label in the early 70s. Its first release was Mike Oldfield\u2019s global hit LP Tubular Bells. It then signed the Sex Pistols and 80s names such as Culture Club before being sold in 1992 for a reported $1bn.\n\nVirgin Trains\n\nVirgin received more than \u00a3300m in dividends during its 22-year operation of the London-Glasgow line. In April, Branson protested when the government refused to approve its partner, Stagecoach, for rail franchise bids. Now the name will vanish from UK rail.\n\nVirgin Money\n\nBranson bought the remnants of Northern Rock in 2011 for \u00a3747m and merged it with his financial firm. It was sold last year to the owner of Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks for \u00a31.7bn but will pay to use the Virgin brand.\n\nVirgin Brides\n\nLaunched in 1996 with a shot of Branson in a wedding dress, the one-stop marriage shop was the idea of a member of Virgin Atlantic\u2019s cabin crew. It closed in 2007. \u201cMaybe it was the picture that put people off,\u201d he said.\n\nVirgin Cola\n\nBranson rammed a tank into a wall of Coke cans in New York in 1998 to launch this venture in the US. But Virgin\u2019s version offered nothing new and Coke applied pressure to distributors. Branson concluded: \u201cDeclaring a soft drink war on Coke was madness.\u201d\n\nVirgin Vie\n\nIn 1997 Branson predicted his cosmetics line would be in 100 high street stores within five years. The venture never took off and in 2009 Virgin paid \u00a38.8m and wrote off \u00a321m of debt for new owners to take over.\n\nVirgin America\n\nBranson launched his domestic US airline in 2007 because flying in the US was \u201cawful\u201d. It was sold to Alaska Airlines in 2016 for $2.6bn against his wishes. Still, he received about \u00a3550m from the sale.", "description": "The relentlessly upbeat entrepreneur believes efficiency and electricity could stop airlines worsening the climate crisis", "authors": ["Gwyn Topham"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/757f19362a156110354b08ee3ba6eb24f18ffd83/0_20_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=00bf4f7b1f07e6b09b8c0daf57bdf589", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
