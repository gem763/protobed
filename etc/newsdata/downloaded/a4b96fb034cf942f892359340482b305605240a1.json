'He is dedicated to improving and he shows that in training and now in games.\n\n'He has played an important role in this game - the second goal (for Hazard) was down to his work to get to the ball.'\n\nValverde also spoke afterwards about his desire to nail down a starting role consistently.\n\nJames Rodriguez came on and scored his first goal of the 2019-20 season in stoppage time\n\nThe door may have opened for the Uruguay international, as Toni Kroos was taken off injured, Modric is only just returning to full fitness and Lucas Vazquez is sidelined.\n\n'To be a winner, you need to overcome obstacles in football,' Valverde said.\n\n'I know that, and that motivates me in what I try and do at Real Madrid. I am very happy here, I try to train and work as hard as I can. The manager is showing that he has faith in me, and that gives me confidence.'", "description": "Valverde, who signed for Madrid in 2016 from Uruguyan club Penarol, has forced his way into the starting XI recently and played astutely alongside Casemiro in midfield on Saturday afternoon.", "authors": ["Kieran Jackson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/10/19356670-0-image-a-25_1570354143788.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
