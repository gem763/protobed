Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nTuesday night marks the fourth debate on the primary calendar \u2014 meaning there\u2019s only eight more of these gauntlets to go in the Democratic primary race. Unlike last month\u2019s debate, the event on October 15 expands the field, with 12 candidates onstage, including one new challenger.\n\nWhat Time Is the Democratic Debate?\n\nHosted by Otterbein University near Columbus, Ohio, the festivities will start at 8 p.m. ET and drag on until 11 p.m.\n\nWhat Channel has the Democratic Debate?\n\nCo-hosted by CNN and the New York Times, the debate will be available for streaming \u2014 without requiring a cable-provider log-in \u2014 at CNN.com, the New York Times mobile app, and on Facebook.\n\nWhat is the Democratic Debate Lineup?\n\nThe candidates will appear onstage, from left to right, as follows:\n\nTulsi Gabbard\n\nTom Steyer\n\nCory Booker\n\nKamala Harris\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nJoe Biden\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nPete Buttigieg\n\nAndrew Yang\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke\n\nAmy Klobuchar\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro\n\nLike last debate, Biden is flanked by the two progressives closest in the polls; unlike last debate, Warren has surpassed the former vice-president in at least one poll, making his front-runner status no longer unanimous.\n\nHow\u2019d They Decide Who Made the Cut?\n\nTo qualify for the debate, the Democratic National Committee determined that Democrats had to receive contributions from a minimum of 130,000 donors and had to register at least 2 percent of support in four DNC-approved polls. Because the qualifications did not increase in difficulty between September and October, candidates had more time to reach the donation and polling requirements \u2014 thus, the inclusion of Tulsi Gabbard and billionaire impeachment enthusiast Tom Steyer.\n\nWho Are the Moderators for the Democratic Debate?\n\nCNN anchor Anderson Cooper, CNN anchor Erin Burnett, and New York Times national editor Mark Lacey.\n\nThe I-Word Looming Over the Debate\n\nA drastic political change has occurred since the last debate: House Democrats are conducting an impeachment inquiry into the president\u2019s quid pro quo pressuring of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings of the former vice-president\u2019s son Hunter Biden. And though a potential impeachment proceeding could benefit Democrats in the long run \u2014 just over half of voters support the president\u2019s removal, according to a recent Fox News poll \u2014 the scandal will be complicate the debate, as New York\u2019s Ed Kilgore notes:\n\nIn talking about Trump and impeachment, the candidates vying to become his vanquisher in November 2020 are in the awkward position of discussing and promoting an event that would make their own competition wildly different if not irrelevant. What are they supposed to do? Boast of how they will tear Mike Pence a new one? Make the general election a referendum on why it took Republicans so long to abandon their corrupt leader? It\u2019s a tough set of questions \u2014 again, for moderators as well as for debaters.\n\nIf any of the debaters \u2026 go after Hunter [Biden], his father could very well exploit the moment to depict himself as the victim of an infamous Trump smear, and also as the candidate Trump fears enough to risk impeachment to smear. Suffice it to say there is some nervous debate prep under way on the subject.\n\nWhen Is the Next Democratic Debate?\n\nHeld on Wednesday, November 20, in Georgia and hosted by MSNBC, the threshold for the next debate went up, as candidates will have to clear 3 percent in at least four national polls \u2014 or polls in early-voting states Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina \u2014 in addition to 160,000 donors. Despite the raised admission point, the debate will still be packed: Candidates who have made the fifth debate thus far include Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang.", "description": "The fourth 2020 Democratic primary debate will air at 8 p.m. on Tuesday and stream for free online at CNN and the New York Times app.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/07/29/detroit_debate.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
