But perceptions of farming are changing as more people venture into it as a livelihood; around two-thirds of the labour force is now engaged in the sector, contributing to 37 percent of GDP.\n\nAnd increasingly, farmers practising subsistence agriculture are using new technologies to increase productivity and marketability. These range from using social media to connect with others in the sector, to partnering with companies that provide drone technology and remote sensing.\n\nNigeria\u2019s population of around 200 million translates to high demand for farm produce, and entrepreneurs, corporations, and governments are working together to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 2 to \u201cend hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture\u201d.\n\nSoilless farming\n\nPS Nutraceuticals uses aeroponics farming, which involves suspending the roots of crops in air and applying mists to help them grow.

The method, which takes place in a controllable environment, has numerous benefits such as requiring minimal water, electricity, and labor. Crops are also quick to harvest and there are limited pests.\n\nFounded in 2016 by Samson Ogbole and O.P. Okocha, the company hopes that by setting up farms which use this technology, it can help ensure food security in Nigeria. \u201cSoilless farming is one of such technologies which can help ensure food supply,\u201d says Ogbole. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a way to replace soil but rather to complement soil\u201d.\n\nThe method has been tested on more than 200 crops, including tomatoes, ginger, onions, rice and even flowers. Food can be produced at any time of year and the spacing system enables higher productivity. \u201cFood production should not be seasonal because hunger is not seasonal,\u201d Ogbole adds.\n\nAs well as being environmentally friendly, the method attracts investment from banks and individuals, Ogbole says, although he admits the sector has traditionally struggled to find funding. \u201cThe absence of technology [in traditional practices] means farming isn\u2019t fully predictable, meaning it can\u2019t be easily insured and thus makes it unattractive to investors,\u201d he says.\n\nGovernment is also tapping into the entrepreneurial spirit. PS Nutraceuticals is in partnership with Lagos State in a scheme to grow rice and tomatoes to feed the growing population. The company is using aeroponics and vine-cutting technology in collaboration with the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture on YIIFSWA-II, a project that seeks to provide affordable, high-quality seed yam tubers for smallholder farmers in Nigeria and Ghana. It has recruited 40 local farmers in Oyo and Ogun states to work on the project.\n\nCutting the waste\n\nLagos-based Farmforte uses temperature-controlled shipping containers to tackle the common problem of food wastage.

Farmforte is a Lagos-based firm that buys up smallholder farmers\u2019 produce, such as cashew and sweet potato, and exports them, alongside running its own sweet potato farm in Edo state. \u201cThis solves the challenges of storage, logistics and market access for smallholder farmers,\u201d says Lola Femi, Farmforte\u2019s content strategist.\n\nFarmforte processes perishable goods and provides transportation for farmers. Technologies such as modern irrigation ensure farming all year, humidifiers prevent produce from perishing, and temperature-controlled shipping containers tackle the common problem of food wastage.\n\nThe use of these new technologies, from aeroponics to modern transportation systems, are gaining traction in Nigeria. There is a community of people enthusiastic about these methods of agriculture and passionate about deploying them in pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n\u201cThey look sexy,\u201d says Ogbole, explaining why young people find them appealing.\n\nFood security, however, will not be achieved simply by increasing food production; consumers need to be able to afford it. And even though many farmers are becoming aware that much more can be achieved in agriculture through these kinds of technologies, most of them do not have access to them.\n\n\u201cIf we continue with the hoes and cutlasses, we will have to depend on other nations to feed [us] effectively. There is a need to pick up technology \u2014 not just machines, but rather automated systems which the smallholder farmers can also use without breaking the bank,\u201d says Ogbole.\n\nThis article was originally published on SciDev.Net.
