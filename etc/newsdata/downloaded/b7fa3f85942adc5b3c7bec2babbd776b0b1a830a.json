We're used to bickering among the very opinionated women at the coffee table, but Navarro's head-to-head with Meghan McCain may have just made history.\n\nDuring this morning's \"Hot Topics,\" the co-hosts entered into a conversation about the whistleblower complaint against President Trump, alleging that he contacted a foreign government, reportedly Ukraine, to find out dirt on his potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden. Trump's critics suggest it could be proof of him abusing his authority, and leading Democrats are hoping to use the report as ammunition for a congressional investigation. But the president said there's nothing untoward about the conversations he's had with foreign leaders.\n\n....statement. Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2019\n\nDuring \"The View\" discussion, McCain tried to make the point that there were hypocritical leftists who loved hearing this White House whistleblower story, but criticized the efforts of WikiLeaks' Julian Assange.\n\nShe later tried to clarify her argument but was interrupted by Navarro. That's when McCain yelled, \"Excuse me!\" and Navarro responded, \"Don't scream at me. I'm two feet away.\"\n\n\"That's so rude, Ana,\" McCain said in response. \"Welcome back.\"\n\nMcCain shook her head in frustration and, as ABC was about to cut to commercial break, viewers could spot McCain storming off set, while members in the audience mumbled awkwardly and sat with shocked expressions on their faces.\n\nSee how it all unfolded below.\n\nMeghan McCain has gotten into a lot of fiery debates with her co-hosts, but this may be the first time it's caused her to walk off set. pic.twitter.com/pdOnI7IlV7 \u2014 Townhall.com (@townhallcom) September 20, 2019\n\nYikes.", "description": ".09/20/2019 18:40:47PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/204/319af9f5-5bb3-49c2-a334-fe9002db288b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
