One of those conditions was to abstain from premarital sex.\n\n\"I was asking people to fast during the album. There were times where I was asking people not to have premarital sex while they were working on the album,\" he shared, acknowledging how \"radical\" the request was.\n\n\"There were times where I went to people that were working on other projects and said, 'Can you just work and focus on this?'\" he added. \"I thought if we could all focus and fast -- families who pray together stay together.\"\n\nWest also opened up about his addiction to pornography during the interview, explaining that he's trying to \"kick the habit.\"\n\n\"Playboy was my gateway into full-on pornography addiction. My dad had a Playboy left out at age 5, and it\u2019s affected almost every choice I made for the rest of my life from age 5 to now, having to kick the habit,\" he said. \"It just presents itself in the open like it's okay. I stand up and say, 'You know, it's not OK.'\"\n\nJesus Is King will is set to be released Friday, October 25.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nKanye West Talks 'Jesus Is King,' Christmas Album and Presidential Run in New Beats 1 Interview\n\nKanye West Previews New Album 'Jesus Is King' and Raps About Chick-Fil-A\n\nKanye West Donates $1 Million to Charity In Honor of Kim Kardashian as 39th Birthday Present\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "The rapper acknowledged how 'radical' the request was.", "authors": ["Jennifer Drysdale"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3WV_g6Li51Vru3GEPJwWng--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/318099142dfe3dbb03259a63d7c403f4", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
