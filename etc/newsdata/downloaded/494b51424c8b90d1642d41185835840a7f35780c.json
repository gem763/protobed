ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt is the result of multiple choices that put corporate profits before people, while our government looked the other way. It is unacceptable, and it must change.\u201d\n\nIn the policy Warren remarks on the unequal environmental burdens placed on communities of color and low income families, many whom still suffer from past racist policies such as redlining. Studies have shown, for example, that black families are more likely to live in areas with high air pollution than white families.\n\nIf elected president, Warren lays out how she\u2019d take climate action by shepherding a \u201cjust transition\u201d to renewable energy use, as laid out in the Green New Deal climate resolution, which Warren co-sponsored in the Senate.\n\nWarren said she would direct the Environmental Protection Agency to better map environmental impacts on at-risk communities and adjust power plant permitting rules to better consider the impact of pollution. She would also mandate all federal agencies to consider climate impacts when issuing permits and submitting rules.\n\n\u201cClimate action needs to be mainstreamed in everything the federal government does. But we also need a standard that requires the government to do more than merely 'assess' the environmental impact of proposed projects \u2014 we need to mitigate negative environmental impacts entirely,\u201d Warren wrote.\n\nOther aspects of her plan include transforming the Council on Environmental Quality to the Council on Climate Action, which she said would have a broader mandate.\n\nWarren\u2019s climate justice plan is one of several policy plans she has rolled out since she announced her candidacy for president. Previous policy papers included calls to place a moratorium on oil and gas drilling on public lands and boost green manufacturing jobs. Warren recently adopted Washington Gov.
