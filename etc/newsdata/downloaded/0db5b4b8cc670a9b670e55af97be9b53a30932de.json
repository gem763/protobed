The fear that the political unrest could trigger military intervention by mainland China has also dented business confidence and fuelled heavy capital outflows.\n\nTo defend the peg with the US dollar, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the de facto central bank, has been forced to intervene in foreign exchange markets in order to prop up the Hong Kong dollar.\n\nBut there are limits to this support, because when the HKMA sells US dollars to buy the local currency it drains Hong Kong dollars from the banking system.\n\nTo counter this squeeze on liquidity, the HKMA earlier this month cut banks' countercyclical buffer for the first time since 2015, a move that could potentially free up an extra $HK300 billion ($56 billion) in bank lending.\n\nIn exchange, nine of Hong Kong's biggest lenders have pledged to support small and medium-sized businesses that are suffering financial strain as a result of the political unrest.\n\nBut this is unlikely to prove more than a temporary solution. With anti-government protests showing little sign of abating, and with the Hong Kong economy lurching inexorably towards recession, the downward pressure on the currency will only intensify.\n\nAnd this will force the HKMA to push interest rates higher in order to defend the peg, rather than providing local businesses with much-needed support by slashing borrowing costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Quiet panic'\n\nIt is an extremely unstable situation, as Kyle Bass, the founder and chief investment officer of Dallas-based Hayman Capital Management has pointed out.\n\nIn an investor letter titled \"The Quiet Panic in Hong Kong\", sent out earlier this year, Bass argued that the currency peg would snap due to mounting geopolitical tension between the US and China and the gap between US and Hong Kong short-term interest rates.\n\nAt the height of the Asian Financial Crisis, he noted, the HKMA pushed short-term interest rates as high as 20 per cent to stem the flood of capital pouring out of the city, causing asset prices to plunge as a result.\n\nBut, Bass argues that such forceful action is no longer possible. That's because most borrowers now have floating, rather than fixed-term, mortgages, and leverage has soared in the past two decades.\n\nIndeed, Hong Kong's banking system is one of the most leveraged in the world, at almost 900 per cent of GDP.\n\nA sharp rise in short-term interest rates aimed at defending the Hong Kong dollar would likely push the local economy into a savage recession, and trigger a resounding crash in property prices.\n\nOther investors believe that Bass is wrong, and that the HKMA will be prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to defend the peg.\n\nOne thing is certain. The longer the Hong Kong protests continue, the more bearish bets speculators are making against the currency, adding an overlay of financial fragility to the deepening political crisis.", "description": "Financial speculators are placing big bets that Hong Kong will be forced to jettison its currency peg with the US dollar as its political crisis deepens.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2627%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_86/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0e7a94a9a110d99d89651ac3f89ee25c3b81557f", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
