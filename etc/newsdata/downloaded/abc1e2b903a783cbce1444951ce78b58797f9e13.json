That was a while ago, I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, and nothing else.\n\nI told her I\u2019d see her tomorrow.\n\nWhen Michelle arrived the next day, I put the dogs in the yard so they wouldn\u2019t bother her. I\u2019d already picked up the kitchen as much as I could, putting away all the dishes and clutter. I\u2019d swept the floor. I\u2019d grimaced at the thought of scrubbing it, even though that\u2019s exactly what I had asked someone else to do. As Michelle walked into the kitchen, I fumbled through the story of hurting my back, and Michelle nodded, knowingly, and told me about her herniated disks. My hands found each other, and I fiddled with my ring.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll leave you to it. I have to check up on some emails today, so I\u2019ll just be in the next room.\u201d\n\nMichelle nodded and walked toward the front door to get more supplies.\n\nShe ended up cleaning for four hours that afternoon, and I chatted with her a bit whenever I grabbed a glass of water, or something from the fridge. I gazed at her yellow gloves; her bucket full of water, soapy from Murphy\u2019s Oil; and the scrubby sponge that looked to be on its last leg, but was new when she arrived. She was often on her knees or sitting when we talked, and I tried not to make a face. I remembered what it was like to talk to a client in the position Michelle was in: on her knees, looking up at a person the same age or younger who has hired you to clean a huge house by yourself , and I told her so, asking her if she needed anything.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, then asked how long I cleaned houses. We ended up talking for quite some time. I eventually told her about my book.\n\n\u201cOh, my daughter would love to read that! She wants to be a writer,\u201d Michelle said. I ran to get her a copy, pausing to personalize and sign it first.\n\nWhen she left, I wrote a check for $40 an hour instead of $30, and said I might need more help with cleaning out my old house for my landlord. She smiled, and we agreed to keep in touch.\n\nThat night my back went out completely, and I was in bed for three days. The pain was some of the most excruciating I\u2019d ever experienced; my left leg later went numb. By the time I saw Michelle again to do a walk-through at my old house, it was the third day I\u2019d been able to walk more than a few feet, and I told her so.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, rubbing her lower spine. \u201cI hurt my back carrying a cooler this weekend when we were camping.\u201d She\u2019d already had a long day. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was late getting here. Moving a little slower, I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh God, don\u2019t worry,\u201d I said, wanting to hug her, but refraining. \u201cI definitely know how that goes.\u201d I shifted my weight from my left leg, almost standing on one foot from the feeling of numbness and residual pain. \u201cSo,\u201d I began, \u201cyou won\u2019t have to do much here, I don\u2019t think,\u201d and I started to walk into the garage.", "description": "After cleaning houses for years, I swore I\u2019d never enlist help myself.
