Data showing slower job creation and weaker manufacturing output are indicating that the Trump administration\u2019s trade war is taking a toll on the U.S. economy.\n\nGlobal markets were further uneased after the U.S. announced late Wednesday that it planned to slap tariffs as high as 25% on $7.5 billion of European imports, after the WTO ruled the EU improperly favored Airbus AIR, +3.71% over Boeing BA, -2.02% in a long-running trans-Atlantic dispute.\n\n\u201cThe dreary economic data does perhaps suggest that traders could be better sellers in this risk-toxic environment,\u201d Stephen Innes, Asia-Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader, said in a note.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei NIK, -2.01% dropped 2% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index HSI, +0.33% slipped 0.4%. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 XJO, -2.21% fell 1.8% and New Zealand\u2019s NZX 50 NZ50GR, -1.19% slid 1%, while benchmark indexes in Taiwan Y9999, -0.66% , Singapore STI, -0.46% , Malaysia FBMKLCI, -0.61% and Indonesia JAKIDX, -0.42% all declined. Markets in mainland China and South Korea were closed for holidays.\n\nAmong individual stocks, SoftBank 9984, -2.02% , Fast Retailing 9983, -3.89% , Toyota 7203, -2.47% and Honda 7267, -2.68% all sank in Tokyo trading. Casino operator Galaxy Entertainment 27, +2.26% rose in Hog Kong, while Wharf Real Estate 1997, -1.37% and CNOOC 883, -0.51% declined. In Australia, Beach Energy BPT, -1.63% , BHP BHP, -3.17% and Westpac Banking WBC, -2.43% all fell.\n\nMarkets already were on edge about whether President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff battle with Beijing, which is weighing on trade worldwide, might tip the global economy into recession.\n\nU.S. and Chinese negotiators are due to meet this month for a 13th round of talks aimed at ending the fight over Beijing\u2019s trade surplus and technology policies. The two sides have made conciliatory gestures including postponing or lifting some punitive tariffs, but there has been no sign of progress toward settling the core issues in the dispute.\n\nAlso Wednesday, investors increased their bets the Federal Reserve will slash interest rates at its next meeting to shield the economy from slowing growth abroad and the effects of the trade war.\n\nMarkets are pricing in a 75% probability the Fed will cut short-term rates by half a percentage point at its Oct. 29-30 meeting. The Fed hasn\u2019t cut rates by that large a margin since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude CLX19, -0.02% gained 13 cents to $52.77 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged 98 cents on Wednesday to close at $52.64. Brent crude BRNZ19, -0.24% , used to price international oils, lost 6 cents to $57.63 per barrel in London. It fell $1.20 the previous session to $57.69.\n\nThe dollar USDJPY, +0.08% edged down to 107.14 yen from Wednesday\u2019s 107.19 yen.", "description": "Asian markets fell in early trading Thursday, following losses on Wall Street triggered by fresh worries about an economic slowdown.", "authors": ["Marketwatch", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GP385_tokyo0_ZG_20180902223214.jpg"}
