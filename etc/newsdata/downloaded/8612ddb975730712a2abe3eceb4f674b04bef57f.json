Three workers died that day when several floors of the multistory building pancaked. Only one body has been removed so far.\n\nThe cranes \u2014 one around 270 feet (82 meters) high, the other about 300 feet (91 meters) \u2014 weighed thousands of tons and were badly damaged in the collapse. They had been tilting dangerously, and officials had feared the towers would come down on their own, possibly smashing into nearby buildings or severely damaging underground gas and electric lines.\n\nBut once the dust had cleared Sunday, it appeared that none of those worst-case scenarios came to pass. The mayor said three windows at the historic Saenger Theater across the street were damaged but they hadn\u2019t received reports of other buildings damaged.\n\nA sewer line was damaged as well, but the mayor said padding that was designed to protect the gas and electric lines \u2014 a major concern \u2014 worked as expected.\n\n\u201cI do not think it could have gone much better,\u201d said Fire Chief Tim McConnell, flanking the mayor.\n\nHe added that one crane fell and got \u201chooked on the building like we wanted. It\u2019s very stable.\u201d He said \u201cit\u2019s way better than what it looks\u201d because of the way it is resting, adding it would now be cut away in pieces by workers using another crane and taken away.\n\nOfficials had repeatedly asked people not to come see the explosions but there were still throngs of people on the streets. Some had brought their own earplugs and masks to protect against the dust. Others had to be removed from nearby rooftops where they had gathered to gawk as police did their final checks.\n\nLoud alarms sounded, and a voice on the police radio said repeatedly \u201cPrepare for detonation!\u201d before explosions set off a thunderous boom. Flashes from the blasts could be seen as the explosives went off.\n\nOne crane that officials had been referring to as Charlie landed on Rampart Street \u2014 standing straight up \u2014 the blackened end visible where the explosives had been placed.\n\n\u201cWe did shake the building pretty good,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nCantrell told reporters that authorities will now begin focusing on bringing out the bodies of the two remaining workers. Already, workers were beginning to remove rubble from the streets shortly after the blasts, and engineers were going through the building to assess the situation as a drone flew overhead for an aerial view.\n\nThe mayor said a monitor had been placed near one of the bodies before the crane demolition so they would know where to locate it, and the demolition didn\u2019t seem to affect the areas where the bodies were.\n\nAuthorities cautioned that the building remains dangerous and unstable though it did not collapse further with Sunday\u2019s demolition. After the bodies are removed, Cantrell said, the building would be demolished.\n\n\u201cLet me be very clear. The expectation and the next mission after we remove our people from the site will be full demolition,\u201d she said.\n\nSince the building collapsed, the towering cranes had been the focus of officials\u2019 concern. Experts, including engineers who worked on demolitions following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, were called in to try to devise a plan before the cranes fell on their own.\n\nOn Thursday, officials announced plans to drop the cranes in a controlled demolition. Workers suspended in a small bucket attached small explosives to various locations on the two cranes, with the goal of causing a series of explosions that would weaken the cranes at key locations and cause them to collapse.\n\nOnce planned for Friday, the demolition was pushed back to Saturday, then Sunday.\n\nOfficials expanded an evacuation zone in the leadup to the detonation, and in an even wider area, vehicles were prohibited and people were told to stay indoors until the demolition was complete.\n\nThe cause of the collapse remains unknown. The Occupational Health and Safety Administration and police are investigating and, officials said evidence gathering began soon after the collapse.\n\n_\n\nFollow Santana on Twitter @ruskygal.", "description": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 Thundering explosions toppled two cranes Sunday that had loomed precariously for days over a partially collapsed hotel in New Orleans,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/20/3936a3_aptopix-crane-demolition-38477-two-large-cranes-hard-rock-hotel-construction-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
