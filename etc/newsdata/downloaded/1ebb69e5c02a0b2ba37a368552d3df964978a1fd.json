The devices, however, won't be impacted until just before midnight UTC on Nov. 3. If the deadline is missed, users will have to back up and restore their phones using a computer, Apple said.\n\nThe handful of users who still have the iPhone 4s or the iPad 4th generation will also be required to update their devices, according to Apple, though failure to do so will only mean that GPS functions on that device won't work.", "description": "Apple warns that those still using an iPhone 5 must update their iOS or lose access to many apps and the app store.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/apple-iphone-5-ap-aa-2-191029_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
