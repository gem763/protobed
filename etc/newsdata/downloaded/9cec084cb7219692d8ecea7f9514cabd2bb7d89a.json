REUTERS/Vincenzo Pinto/Pool\n\nVATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Sunday scolded countries that produce weapons for wars fought elsewhere and then refuse to take in refugees fleeing the very same conflicts.\n\nThe 82-year-old Argentine pope, whose parents were of Italian immigrant stock, has made the defence of migrants and refugees a plank of his pontificate and he has often clashed over immigration policy with U.S. President Donald Trump and populist anti-immigrant politicians in Europe.\n\nFrancis has also criticised the arms trade repeatedly and his sermon for 40,000 people in St. Peter\u2019s Square on Sunday linked the issues of war and migration as the Roman Catholic Church marked its World Day of Migrants and Refugees.\n\n\u201cWars only affect some regions of the world, yet weapons of war are produced and sold in other regions which are then unwilling to take in the refugees generated by these conflicts,\u201d Francis said.\n\nSunday\u2019s Mass was attended by many immigrants and groups helping them. It was also marked by a mix of African, Spanish and Portuguese music as well as traditional Church music.\n\nFrancis said the world is becoming increasingly \u201celitist and cruel towards the excluded\u201d, adding that it is the duty of Christians to look after all those left behind in a \u201cthrowaway culture\u201d taking root in society.\n\n\u201cThis means being a neighbour to all those who are mistreated and abandoned on the streets of our world, soothing their wounds and bringing them to the nearest shelter, where their needs can be met,\u201d he said.\n\nPeople could not remain indifferent to \u201cthe bleak isolation, contempt and discrimination experienced by those who do not belong to \u2018our\u2019 group\u201d, the pope said.\n\nFrancis then inaugurated a large statue in St. Peter\u2019s Square, showing dozens of migrants and refugees from different faiths and different periods of history.", "description": "Pope Francis on Sunday scolded countries that produce weapons for wars fought elsewhere and then refuse to take in refugees fleeing the very same conflicts.", "authors": ["Philip Pullella", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435173744&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0CE", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
