The Series 5 comes with an always-on Retina display for the first time, as well as improved health and emergency calling features. Apple will sell the Series 5 alongside the less pricey Series 3.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 5 has some features that might make an upgrade worth the money. Here, we broke down the differences between the models to help you decide.\n\nNow tell us what you think!\n\nThe Series 5 has an always-on Retina display.\n\nsource Stephen Lam/Reuters\n\nArguably the most important feature of the new model, the updated display shows a dimmed version of the screen at all times. Raising your wrist activates the screen to full brightness. Apple says that battery life should stay consistent with last year\u2019s model at around 18 hours per charge, thanks to a new high-efficiency processor.\n\nIn the Series 4, the display was off unless activated in order to conserve battery life.\n\nThe Series 5 has new health-tracking and safety features.\n\nsource Apple\n\nThe Watch OS 6 operating system, which comes with the Series 5 and will roll out to older models on September 19, includes new health features that will allow people to track their menstrual cycles and see fertility windows. It also comes with a sensor that can warn about potentially unsafe noise levels, like at a concert.\n\nThe watch can detect if the wearer falls, and on cellular models, can now place emergency calls in more than 150 countries.\n\nBoth the Series 5 and Series 4 have heart-rate tracking, including low-heart-rate notification and atrial-fibrillation detection, as demonstrated in an emotional video from the Apple keynote.\n\nThe Series 5 comes with a compass.\n\nsource Apple\n\nOn the Series 5, Apple added a built-in compass which will allow Apple Maps and other location apps to automatically orient correctly for easier navigation.\n\nThe Series 5 comes with more color and finish options.\n\nsource Apple\n\nThe cellular version of the Apple Watch Series 5 will be available in aluminum, stainless steel, titanium, and ceramic finishes, with options for gold, space black, space gray, silver, and white, depending on the material.\n\nRead more: Apple is set to launch 3 new health studies using data from the iPhone and Apple Watch. Here\u2019s what they plan to investigate.\n\nLike last year\u2019s models, the base GPS model starts at $399, and the GPS and cellular model starts at $499. Stainless steel costs $699, while the titanium case costs $799. On the higher end, a special black stainless steel Herm\u00e8s model of the watch starts at $1,249.\n\nThe Series 5 is more customizable.\n\nsource Apple\n\nBeyond the finish options, the variety of bands sold by Apple gives you nearly endless options to customize your Apple Watch. Collaborations with brands like Nike and Herm\u00e8s provide extra ways to coordinate your smartwatch to the rest of your look.\n\nPreviously, Apple Watches came with a preselected band and you could opt to buy additional bands of your choosing. But this year, Apple created a new service called \u201cApple Watch Studio,\u201d which allows you to create the whole package, either online or in stores.\n\nA basic nylon band will run you $49, but if you\u2019re looking for something more decadent, go for the $539 Hermes leather option.\n\nThese bands will also fit the Series 4, just make sure that you buy the right size.\n\nThe Series 5 and Series 4 come in 40 and 44 mm options, and share most of their other features.\n\nsource YouTube/MKBHD\n\nApple no longer sell the Series 4; it now carries the Series 5 and Series 3 only.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 5 is currently available for preorder, and will be available online and in stores on September 20.", "description": "Business Insider - The new Apple Watch is an updated version of 2018's Apple Watch Series 4, which Apple will no longer sell..
