However, overall demand didn't improve, and foreign demand declined notably, leading product inventories to grow,\" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group said.\n\nThe subindex for total new orders inched down in August though staying in expansionary territory. The subindex for new export orders remained in contractionary territory and further dipped to its lowest level this year, reflecting weakening demand amid intensifying trade dispute between China and the U.S.\n\n\"China's economy showed signs of a short-term recovery, but downward pressure remains a long-term problem. Amid unstable Sino-American relations, China needs to step up countercyclical policies,\" Mr. Zhong said.\n\nMeanwhile, China's official manufacturing PMI, the competing official gauge, which was released over the weekend showed a weaker result as the index fell to 49.5 in August, a tad slower than 49.7 in July.\n\nThe difference between the two gauges was because the Caixin PMI mainly tracks small private factories, while the official index reflects the big manufacturers' operating conditions. The official PMI has a larger sample base surveying 3,000 manufacturers nationwide, while Caixin polls 500 companies.\n\n-Grace Zhu\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 01, 2019 22:40 ET (02:40 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
