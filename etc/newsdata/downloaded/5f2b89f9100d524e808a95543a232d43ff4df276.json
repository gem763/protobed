Lamb hit a three-run double in the seventh inning as Arizona rallied for a 7-5 victory over the Miami Marlins.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret how I\u2019ve been playing,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cBut I feel like I\u2019ve done a pretty good job of coming to the yard every day, trying to get better and I just work, work, work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to come through in that situation. I\u2019ve always loved hitting in those situations.\u201d\n\nClinging to slim postseason hopes, remained 5\u00bd games back of the Chicago Cubs for the second NL wild card with 11 to play and also would have to leapfrog Milwaukee, Philadelphia and the New York Mets.\n\nAt 52-98, the NL-worst Marlins matched their loss total of last year and appear headed to their first 100-defeat season since 2013.\n\nArizona\u2019s Robbie Ray pitched 5 2/3 innings of no-hit ball before Starlin Castro sent the left-hander\u2019s 86th pitch up the middle for single. The Diamondbacks led 3-0 at the time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some tough losses so I just wanted to get the team out on the right foot in this series and set the tone,\u201d Ray said.\n\nRay was replaced in the seventh after walking the leadoff batter, and Yoan L\u00f3pez allowed a two-run homer to pinch-hitter Neil Walker.\n\n\u201cOne of the toughest things in all of baseball is pinch-hitting and in that situation you are just looking to get a pitch in the zone to do something with,\u201d Walker said.\n\nL\u00f3pez then gave up a single and a walk before being replaced by left-hander Andrew Chafin, who faced left-handed-hitting Magneuris Sierra. The speedy Sierra dropped a perfect bunt down the third-base line and Chafin - who wasn\u2019t going to get Sierra out anyway - made an errant throw to first that scored Lewis Brinson with the tying run.\n\nJon Berti hit a two-run single off right-hander Yoshihisa Hirano, the fourth pitcher of the inning, to push the Marlins ahead 5-3.\n\nThen it was the Marlins turn to have a pitching breakdown.\n\nArizona sent eight batters to the plate in the seventh, punctuated by Lamb\u2019s two-out double down the right-field line.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s working harder than Jake Lamb to make good moments happen,\u201d manager Torey Lovullo said. \u201cWe know what type of year he\u2019s having. It\u2019s been very frustrating. But to have him come through in that critical moment was a really good sign.\u201d\n\nKetel Marte hit an RBI double and Eduardo Escobar hit a solo homer for his 35th of the season.\n\nHirano (5-5) pitched a scoreless inning, and Kevin Ginkel got three straight outs for his first big league save. Tayron Guerrero (1-2) gave up three runs, two hits and a walk without getting any outs.\n\nOUCH\n\nArizona set a team record when Wilmer Flores, Josh Rojas and Jake Lamb were hit by pitches in the same inning by Pablo L\u00f3pez. Flores was hit on the shoulder while Rojas and Lamb were both hit on a foot by breaking balls. Lamb was hit with the bases loaded, scoring Flores for a 1-0 lead.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nMarlins: Miami claimed LHP Josh Smith off waivers from Cleveland and threw a scoreless eighth inning. The 29-year-old pitched eight games in relief this season for the Indians, striking out 12 over 8 1/3 innings.\n\nDiamondbacks: Ray pitched well after battling a blister on the middle finger of his throwing hand over the last two starts. He lasted just two-thirds of an inning against the Mets on Sept. 11, giving up five runs. \u2026 SS Nick Ahmed left the game in the eighth inning after a finger injury on his throwing hand. Lovullo said Ahmed\u2019s finger got hit by a bad hop and it peeled back his fingernail. \u2026 RHP Archie Bradley was unavailable to pitch on Monday because of back spasms.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMarlins: Miami sends LHP Caleb Smith to the mound. He\u2019s got an 8-10 record with a 4.13 ERA.\n\nDiamondbacks: Arizona LHP Alex Young will make his 14th start. He is 7-4 with a 3.38 ERA and set a club rookie record by striking out 12 against the Reds on Sept. 7.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jake Lamb has spent a big chunk of this season injured and even when healthy, his .199 batting average entering Monday was proof of a year gone awry.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Brandt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/marlins_diamondbacks_baseball_52081_c0-151-3600-2249_s1770x1032.jpg?86a0ad2941f4f8cac64fde118e16286d6ebd0c8d", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
