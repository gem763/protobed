But if you stop to think about it, do you have any idea exactly which book? Do you know what they\u2019ve already read? Do you know the celebrated authors they secretly hate and the unheard of ones they love? Luckily, you can avoid that mess by giving a book-adjacent gift, instead. We spoke to writers, editors, publishing people, and other avid readers to track down the best gifts for bookworms \u2014 that aren\u2019t books.\n\nGifts for keeping books tidy\n\nUmbra Conceal Floating Bookshelf, Small, Silver, Set of 3 $22 (was $30, now 27% off) Even book lovers who prefer minimalist home d\u00e9cor can easily enter Hoarders territory when it comes to their shelves. Rachel Krupitsky, who works on marketing strategy at Penguin Random House, said an unexpected gift helped her remedy this problem: \u201cMy husband installed floating bookshelves around our apartment as a surprise \u2014 so that I didn\u2019t have to stop buying and bringing home books.\u201d In small apartments without much floor space, floating bookshelves are an ideal solution to literary overcrowding. $22 at Amazon Buy $22 at Amazon Buy\n\nCeramic Dachshund Dog Bookends $57 (was $68, now 16% off) One of the best gifts Jen Bergstrom, senior vice-president and publisher of the Gallery Books Group, ever received was a pair of elephant bookends \u201cfrom one of my favorite authors, who knows that I have way too many books in my office and my apartment, and that the elephant is my spirit animal.\u201d For anyone whose spirit animal is actually a dachshund: We like this set of chartreuse bookends. $57 at Wayfair Buy\n\nMenagerie Whale Bookend Set If you\u2019re buying for someone whose style is more nautical, you could opt for these white whale stoneware bookends. $150 at Jonathan Adler Buy\n\nSwoop Black Marble Bookends Or if their spirit animal is actually Richard Serra, these brutalist black marble bookends will probably match up with their home d\u00e9cor. $60 at CB2 Buy\n\nGifts for not losing your page\n\nC.R. Gibson Leatherette Bookmark, Gold-Foil Lettering, Fur Pom-pom Accent $10 (was $11, now 9% off) The best book-ish gift Abbe Wright, editor of Read it Forward, ever received was a pink leatherette bookmark that read \u201cWhen something goes wrong in your life, just yell \u2018Plot Twist\u2019 and move on.\u201d She said, \u201cit was especially meaningful because [my former boss] gave it to me after my dad died. Whenever I look at it, I\u2019m reminded to not get mired in my grief but rather to keep putting one foot in front of the other.\u201d Wright\u2019s specific bookmark is no longer available, but C.R. Gibson makes others, like this one about a \u201cbook hangover.\u201d $10 at Amazon Buy $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nPostcards From Penguin: 100 Book Covers in One Box $16 (was $25, now 36% off) Instead of a bookmark, Nicole Lamy, New York Times Match Book columnist, likes to use one of these vintage book-cover postcards to keep her place in a book because she loves the imagery and meaning behind them. She\u2019ll also hang them on the wall for inspiration or mail one to another book-loving friend $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nIzola Be Right Back Brass Bookmark This understated metal bookmark \u2014 engraved with \u201cBe Right Back\u201d \u2014 is a sleeker option. $14 at Spring Buy\n\nGifts for people who lend out books\n\nGalison Bookplates for All Book Friends Book lovers enjoy lending out their favorite books to friends \u2014 as long as they get them back. Wright would love to be gifted bookplates because \u201cperhaps if my friends kept seeing that in the front of all the books they\u2019ve borrowed from me, the guilt would help the books get returned.\u201d Get a set for the friend whose books you\u2019re always borrowing. $6 at Amazon Buy $6 at Amazon Buy\n\nOration Rubber Stamps Library Embosser Like Wright, one of Bergstrom\u2019s best friends is \u201ca voracious reader who always loans out her books to people, and then complains when she never gets them back.\u201d She gifted her this elegant, personalized embosser so her friend can \u201cmark her territory, so to speak.\u201d The rubber stamp will emboss your friend\u2019s name on the page \u2014 no ink required. $26 at Neiman Marcus Buy\n\nCustom Ex Libris Oak Crown Bookplate Stamp You can also order this book stamp with your giftee\u2019s name and initials, so they can leave a scholarly mark on their book collection. $40 at Etsy Buy\n\nBest armchair-reading accessories\n\nPlantronics BackBeat PRO 2 Special Edition $150 (was $241, now 38% off) Krupitsky said her dream gift would be \u201ca vacation to a quiet island where I could read in peace,\u201d but she\u2019d gladly settle for nice noise-canceling headphones to simulate an oasis, even on the subway. Strat writer Steven John thinks these Plantronics headphones are the absolute best at \u201c[shutting] out all the background sound, from voices to vehicles to everything in between.\u201d Perfect for reading in solitude. $150 at Amazon Buy $150 at Amazon Buy\n\nCOWIN E7 Active Noise-Canceling Bluetooth Headphones For a more affordable pair, these wireless headphones got a rave review on Amazon: \u201cThe sound quality is crisp and enjoyable, trust me when I say the noise-canceling version is worth the extra money. If you\u2019re a fan of softer music like scores or jazz and hate that you can\u2019t listen to it well in public, that mode helps quite well with it.\u201d $60 at Amazon Buy $60 at Amazon Buy\n\nSofia Cashmere Woven Fringe Throw To go with the headphones, Emily Temple, senior editor at Lit Hub said the best gift she ever got was a gray cashmere throw: \u201cIt lives on my loveseat in my apartment, where I do most of my reading, and it\u2019s so soft and cozy that I think it has probably led to me finishing more books, because I am very rarely tempted to get up from under it, except to make more tea.\u201d $175 at Saks Fifth Avenue Buy\n\nBrooklinen Throw Blanket In gray plaid, this baby-alpaca throw is from one of our all-time-favorite bedding companies. $229 at Spring Buy\n\nUrban Outfitters Pieced Stripe Throw Blanket $40 (was $69, now 42% off) Far less expensive, a lot more colorful, but just as cozy, we like this lightweight warm-tone blanket. $40 at Spring Buy\n\nGifts for reading in the bathtub\n\nOver-Tub Caddy in Satin Nickel Reading in the tub is one of life\u2019s better luxuries, and this metal tray makes it easier. Temple said as a kid she \u201cdreamed that one day someone would invent a machine that would hold up my book and turn the pages for me so I could submerge completely while I read.\u201d In the meantime, she\u2019d love if someone gifted her ones of these trays: \u201cThey may not turn the pages for you, but they at least keep you from dropping your brand new hardcover in the water. Which yes, I have done, both as a child and as an adult.\u201d The stainless steel is rust-resistant and the book rack is adjustable to get just the right angle. $30 at Bed Bath & Beyond Buy\n\nTeak Bathtub Caddy Strat writer Verena von Pfetten once spent two and a half hours in the tub thanks to this tray which she said has \u201cthe naturalistic appeal of an expandable Danish secretary desk.\u201d Adjustable to the size of their tub, it\u2019s also designed to hold a stemmed wine glass and has a circular spot for soap \u2014 or their favorite candle \u2014 making for the best bath, ever. $40 at Bed Bath & Beyond Buy\n\nGifts for nocturnal readers\n\nMighty Bright Rechargeable Book Light Lamy recommended this book lamp from Mighty Bright that\u2019s perfect for reading in bed: \u201cIt has a flexible, really nice texture, it\u2019s a little bit squishy, compact and light, and has a flexible arm.\u201d It\u2019s rechargeable via an included USB cable. $24 at Amazon Buy $24 at Amazon Buy\n\nMOMO Wooden Folding Book Light Bergstrom said she\u2019d love to be gifted one of these book lamps for her nightstand. When it isn\u2019t opened up and glowing, the wood lamp closes shut to blend in with the other hardcover books on a nightstand. $33 at Amazon Buy $33 at Amazon Buy\n\nGifts for bookworms who love games\n\nPapercuts: A Party Game for the Rude and Well-Read $20 (was $25, now 20% off) From the website Electric Literature, this game is \u201cbasically a literary version of Cards against Humanity,\u201d says Halimah Marcus, executive director of the site. \u201cWe had a blast writing the clues.\u201d $20 at Electric Literature Buy\n\nThis Book Is a Camera This is technically a book, not a game, but it\u2019s unlike any other book because it\u2019s also a fully functional camera. It explains the fundamentals of photography while letting you practice taking and developing your own photos as you read. Gregory Sato, assistant manager of online sales for Housing Works bookstore, bought one for his niece and said, \u201ceven if she only uses it once, I just want to see how it works for my own sake.\u201d $27 at MoMA Design Store Buy\n\nExperiential gifts for book lovers\n\n\u2019One Story\u2019 Subscription Rather than buying someone a straightforward book or two, Lamy said she\u2019d love to be gifted a subscription to a literary magazine, to inspire her future reading. \u201cThat\u2019s how I make book discoveries,\u201d she said. \u201cI follow up on stories that I love and I know to watch for those authors publishing books.\u201d A subscription to One Story comes without too much commitment, since it publishes, yes, just one story each month. $21 at One Story Buy\n\nGreenlight Bookstore First Editions Club Another little cheat: this is a book gift but without the pressure of picking a book. A subscription to the First Editions Club from Brooklyn\u2019s Greenlight Bookstore comes with a signed copy of a newly published book each month. Luis Jaramillo, author of The Doctor\u2019s Wife and director of the school of writing at The New School, said the selection, \u201clike the bookstore itself, is extremely well-curated.\u201d $250 at Greenlight Bookstore Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
