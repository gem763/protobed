But because of the way things develop, my students can ask themselves what questions they would need to ask if they were a funder and what questions weren't asked in this case; it brings up really good discussion points on that front. It's also a book that leads to very good discussions about corporate responsibility and the things you should care about when you're running a company.\"", "description": "Among the top choices for professors at Stanford, Harvard, Kellogg, and more are \"Who Moved My Cheese?,\" \"Good to Great,\" and \"Bad Blood.\"", "authors": ["Robin Madell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d373cab100a24560454d285?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-08-29"}
