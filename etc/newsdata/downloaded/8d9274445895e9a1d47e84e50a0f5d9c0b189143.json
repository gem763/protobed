But when they started investigating day care centers in their neighborhood, the new parents experienced some serious sticker shock.\n\n\"The cost of day care was a big surprise,\" says Ian, who found that prices where they live in Jacksonville, Florida, ranged from $1,000 to $1,200 a month.\n\nAguilar, a certified financial planner, says having another child -- as they hope to -- will push their child care costs beyond their monthly house payments\n\n\"You add up the costs ... and pretty soon you're paying more toward child care than a mortgage, and that's less than ideal,\" says Aguilar.\n\nNikki and Ian Aguilar, with their daughter Emilia, were shocked at the cost of child care.\n\nOn a national level, Florida sits at the lower end of the child care cost spectrum with infant care costing an average $9,238 a year, or $770 a month, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
