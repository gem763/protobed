HKFP projected BTCPay as better service, stating that it would allow donators to remain anonymous, a feature that was missing in a more-regulated BitPay.\n\n\u201cHelp us eliminate processing fees or make a fully anonymous contribution by donating Bitcoin,\u201d wrote HKFP.\n\nHKFP has escaped the clutches of BitPay and \u2013 with the kind help of @LeoAW \u2013 now accepts Bitcoin again via BTCPay: https://t.co/RdUnfImJ5O Thank you Leo! \u2014 Tom Grundy (@tomgrundy) October 10, 2019\n\nThe Brawl That Started It All\n\nHKFP\u2019s announcement came a month after the agency complained about BitPay for blocking their bitcoin payments. Editor-in-chief Tom Grundy took to Twitter to explain how the US company was sitting atop their donations for almost three weeks. He added BitPay refused to process their financial transactions because it does not support IBAN, an internationally recognized, standardized method of identifying bank accounts during a money transaction.\n\n\u201cNever use BitPay, folks,\u201d Grundy tweeted, adding the firm offers \u201ctruly the worst experience you can imagine \u2013 poor reputation, abysmal communication, horrible customer service, *very* high fees.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlmost any alternative will be better,\u201d he said.\n\nGrundy also threatened to sue BitPay\u2019s co-founder & CEO Stephen Pair, stating that he is \u201cready to go to war.\u201d\n\nBitPay did not issue any official statement related to the controversy, which might have led Grundy & co to look for better, peer-to-peer alternatives.\n\nBitcoin to the Rescue\n\nNonprofit journalist groups have continuously relied on bitcoin for receiving donations. The cryptocurrency helps them bypass expensive \u2013 and often overly-regulated \u2013 banking systems. Even whistleblowers like Wikileaks, whose inbound contributions were once blocked by Visa and Mastercard, resorted to bitcoin. HKFP, which relentlessly offers non-biased reports out of Chinese and Hong Kong regions, therefore relies on the cryptocurrency for the very same reason.\n\nThe agency has so far received HK$15,000 worth of support in bitcoin. But, owing to the cryptocurrency\u2019s underlying price volatility, it had opted to hire BitPay, which instantly converts bitcoin payments to fiat for a fee. Nevertheless, with BitPay choking HKFP\u2019s payments, especially in times of ongoing protests in Hong Kong, the nonprofit thought it was better to either halt their bitcoin payment option or choose an alternative.\n\nThe event put BitPay in a bad light, specifically after similar incidents showed the US firm blocking payments to specific firms. The most controversial decision in the recent memory was of preventing donations that could have contributed groups fighting against the Amazon rainforest fires.", "description": "Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP) has fired BitPay, a US-based bitcoin payment processing service, over non-service.
