For this, the central government has provided assistance of Rs 1150 crore and 18,000 machines have been given to farmers in Punjab and Haryana. They will not need to burn the stubble. It will be broken and will be turned into manure,\" he said.\n\nAFP/ FILE\n\nJavadekar, however, said more needs to be done. \"There is a need to do it much more. Now it has started, earlier it had not even started.
