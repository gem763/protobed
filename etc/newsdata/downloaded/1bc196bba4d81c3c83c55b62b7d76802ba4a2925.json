It\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nThough Smith has drawn praise from other LGBTQ artists and advocacy groups, they\u2019ve received a fair share of backlash, too. Speaking on \u201cGood Morning Britain,\u201d British media personality Piers Morgan suggested that Smith had only shared their pronouns as a publicity stunt, calling the announcement \u201ca load of nonsense.\u201d\n\nIn the interview, Lambert also drew comparisons between his experiences as a gay pop artist and that of Smith.\n\nAfter he was named the Season 8 runner-up on \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d in 2009, Lambert ended media speculation over his sexuality when he came out as gay in a Rolling Stone cover story.\n\nLater that same year, Lambert stoked controversy after angering the Parents Television Council at the American Music Awards. While his rendition of the song \u201cFor Your Entertainment\u201d was tame by Madonna or Lady Gaga standards, it featured brief allusions to gay love, including a moment in which he and his male keyboard player shared an open-mouthed kiss.\n\n\u201cThe media loves something that feels new and 10 years ago \u2013 in America anyway \u2013 there wasn\u2019t a lot of mainstream music people identifying as gay, so it was a novelty,\u201d Lambert said. \u201cI feel there might be some parallels there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you stop for a minute and make it not about you and put yourself in the shoes of the person that\u2019s being talked about and try to understand their experience \u2013 just for a second \u2013 you\u2019ll realise what\u2019s being asked is just that you be a decent human being,\u201d he continued. \u201cPeople get defensive, saying: \u2018How dare you ask me to change the way I think!\u2019 and just a little empathy would help.\u201d\n\nLambert and Smith\u2019s friendship dates back to around 2016, when the pair shared photos of themselves hanging out together in London and Mykonos. Last year, Smith found themself in hot water after Lambert accidentally shared a video of them expressing their distaste for Michael Jackson on Instagram.\n\nLambert, of course, defended his friend, telling People, \u201cIt was a sliver of a fuller conversation that was actually quite interesting. I think people need to give [them] a break.\u201d", "description": "The gay \"American Idol\" veteran sees \"some parallels\" between his journey and that of Smith, who is genderqueer and nonbinary.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9d4c192100003107ac991d.jpeg?cache=jihhy8bznr&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
