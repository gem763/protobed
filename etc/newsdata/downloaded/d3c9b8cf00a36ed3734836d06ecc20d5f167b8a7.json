(Sorry.) But what Zuckerberg *has* done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform \u2015 and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump\u2019s checks,\u201d it adds. \u201cFacebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. Now, they\u2019re deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people. It\u2019s time to hold Mark Zuckerberg accountable.\u201d\n\nFacebook drew ire this week for refusing to pull an ad that makes false accusations about former Vice President Joe Biden, who is Warren\u2019s 2020 rival in the Democratic race. The platform has also faced heavy scrutiny over the role it played in the widespread dissemination of misinformation about candidates including Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election.\n\nIn audio that leaked last week, Zuckerberg said he was prepared to \u201cgo to the mat and ... fight\u201d lawmakers such as Warren who are keen to break up big technology companies.\n\nWarren, meanwhile, this week called out Facebook\u2019s \u201cincredible power to affect elections and out national debate\u201d in a lengthy Twitter thread, below:\n\nFacebook has incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. Mark Zuckerberg is telling employees that he views a Warren administration as an \u201cexistential\u201d threat to Facebook. The public deserves to know how Facebook intends to use their influence in this election. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 7, 2019\n\nFor instance, Trump and Zuckerberg met at the White House two weeks ago. What did they talk about? https://t.co/KqEi8LxkrS \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 7, 2019\n\nAfter that meeting, Facebook quietly changed its policies on \u201cmisinformation\u201d in ads, allowing politicians to run ads that have already been debunked by independent, non-partisan fact-checkers. Put another way, Facebook is now okay with running political ads with known lies. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 7, 2019\n\nThey\u2019re allowing Trump to spend over $1 million a week right now for ads on their platform\u2014including ones that air the same lies that TV stations won\u2019t. Here\u2019s an example of an ad that Facebook let Trump run despite being obviously untrue: https://t.co/sQdKCmrkOr pic.twitter.com/2X2S95Ep0H \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 7, 2019\n\nFacebook already helped elect Donald Trump once because they were asleep at the wheel while Russia attacked our democracy\u2014allowing fake, foreign accounts to run ad campaigns to influence our elections. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 7, 2019\n\nThere\u2019s no indication that Zuckerberg or Facebook executives have come to terms with the role their unpreparedness played in that successful attack, nor have they shown that they understand what needs to be done to prevent another attack in the 2020 election. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 7, 2019\n\nIn fact, this time they\u2019re going further by taking deliberate steps to help one candidate intentionally mislead the American people, while painting the candidacy of others (specifically: mine) as an \"existential\u201d threat. This is a serious concern for our democratic process. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 7, 2019\n\nWe need accountability. That should start with Congress and the appropriate state authorities opening investigations and conducting hearings to make Facebook executives explain the company\u2019s policies and practices\u2014under oath. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 7, 2019\n\nNick Clegg, the former deputy UK prime minister who is now Facebook\u2019s vice president of global affairs and communications, said last month that the company didn\u2019t believe \u201cit\u2019s an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician\u2019s speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why Facebook exempts politicians from our third-party fact-checking program. We have had this policy on the books for over a year now, posted publicly on our site under our eligibility guidelines,\u201d he added. \u201cThis means that we will not send organic content or ads from politicians to our third-party fact-checking partners for review. However, when a politician shares previously debunked content including links, videos and photos, we plan to demote that content, display related information from fact-checkers, and reject its inclusion in advertisements.\u201d", "description": "With her new ad, the Democratic presidential candidate is playing the platform at its own game.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da1a73e200000690550012a.jpeg?cache=pfobart84m&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
