The point to me, we are talking about now is not whether the game will take place on Sunday, that will be a purely meteorological issue.\n\n'The issue will be if it can't take place then we're really, really pressing the point that we need to have to get this game delayed 24 hours later.\n\nSRU chief Mark Dodson says Scotland will not become 'collateral damage' of the World Cup\n\n'We've had consistent dialogue since the last three or four days around this with senior people at World Rugby, but World Rugby seem to be determined to stick to its plan that the match is either played on Sunday or indeed it is cancelled, and to have it cancelled and have our ability to progress from this group put at peril, we believe is absolutely unacceptable.\n\n'World Rugby is pointing us back to the participation agreement. We've had legal opinion - from a leading QC - that challenges World Rugby's interpretation.\n\n'We don't know that (it's too late) - we have to challenge it.'", "description": "Sunday's clash, which is effectively a play-off match for a quarter-final place, may still be called off by World Rugby in the aftermath of Super-Typhoon Hagibis, which is set to hit on Saturday.", "authors": ["Harry Slavin For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/09/19578548-0-image-a-5_1570783430476.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
