He can appeal.\n\nHodge was cited for a shoulder-led hit on the head of Fiji flanker Peceli Yato that saved a try in the first half of their match last Saturday in Sapporo.\n\n\u201cThere was a high degree of danger,\u201d the independent disciplinary committee said in a statement.\n\nYato had to leave the field with symptoms of concussion, and missed Fiji\u2019s second pool game on Wednesday against Uruguay.\n\nAfter a four-hour hearing in Tokyo, World Rugby said Hodge was found guilty of a reckless high tackle to the head that was worthy of a red card. Hodge was not sanctioned on the field at the time by New Zealand referee Ben O\u2019Keeffe.\n\nThe committee considered a six-week sanction, the minimum in the laws, and reduced it to three after regarding Hodge\u2019s disciplinary record, character, and conduct.\n\nHe will be available to play in the knockout rounds.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Winger Reece Hodge will miss Australia's three remaining pool matches in the Rugby World Cup in Japan after he was suspended on Wednesday for a dangerous high tackle.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/japan_rugby_wcup_australia_fiji_59640_c0-121-2891-1806_s1770x1032.jpg?06869a14be0fc2ee8a69f81c9b8c5accdd673098", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
