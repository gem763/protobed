In fact, many clothing-industry professionals tend to be quite well-read because they need books to do their jobs well. Creative types can spend hours browsing through the photography and art sections of bookstores; research into sartorial history is conducted at specialty libraries; and fashion designers often have their own in-house libraries. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves lined the walls of the late Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s photo studio and that was only a fraction of his collection. When you\u2019re creatively stuck, printed matter can provide inspiration. Here are a few of the most interesting literary spots around the world for those who are interested in fashion.\n\nNew York\n\nDashwood Books\n\nThis subterranean lair has been one of the ultimate literary destinations for downtown hipsters since 2005. According to owner David Strettell, the pop star Rihanna once came by, stood at the door, took her shades off slowly and asked, \u201cDo you have anything for\u2014me?\u201d (A representative for the star did not confirm or deny the anecdote.) One presumes she was able to find something interesting among the stacks of collectible photography and illustration tomes that Mr. Strettell has accumulated. Dashwood started publishing books, too, over a decade ago, with artists such as Nobuyoshi Araki. dashwoodbooks.com\n\nPrinted Matter\n\nNew York\n\nPrinted Matter\n\nEach of the two New York branches of this offbeat retailer is full of one-of-a-kind, independently published books. Its executive director, Max Schumann, attributes the shops\u2019 success among those in the fashion world to an increase in \u201ccrossover\u2014for better and worse\u2014between the visual art world and commercial creative industries.\u201d Printed Matter is known for its artists\u2019 books, which often come in limited editions\u2014which can be less than 100 copies. The store has an \u201copen submission policy\u201d that allows any artist to submit a book for consideration. printedmatter.org\n\nParis\n\nLe Comptoir de l\u2019Image\n\nThis cramped, overflowing treasure trove of rare fashion books in a quiet corner of the art-gallery-heavy Marais district is worth a visit for such gems as Richard Avedon\u2019s coveted photo collection \u201cMade in France.\u201d Among the precarious piles of books (which are charmingly disorganized), a visitor may be fortunate enough to catch a glimpse of the owner, Michel Fink, a former photographer. When asked to describe his 25-year-old shop, he muttered, \u201cI guess everything here just has to do with imagery, and photographic imagery and also fashion photographic imagery.\u201d +33 1 42 72 09 17\n\nDonlon Books\n\nLondon\n\nDonlon Books\n\nLocated in the bustling Broadway Market\u2014more widely known for selling fruit and vegetables than rare books\u2014Donlon is a shop with volumes touching on everything from critical theory and counterculture to design and style. The bookstore is known for hosting eclectic events with the likes of fashion designer Matty Bovan and the hairdresser Steve Brooks of cult salon Cuts. Film director John Waters has also stopped by the shop a few times. The shop\u2019s walls are painted Yves Klein blue, and an inviting tiger-shaped rug on the floor make it feel homey. donlonbooks.com\n\nTokyo\n\nCowbooks\n\nLocated in the trendy Tokyo neighborhood of Nakameguro, Cowbooks may well be one of the most legendary bookstores for lovers of esoteric visual inspiration anywhere. Among the many books on offer include a Japanese version of Charles M. Schulz\u2019s iconic reference book \u201cThe Charlie Brown Dictionary\u201d; a vintage catalog from the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe, N.M.; and Richard Horn\u2019s \u201cMemphis: Objects, Furniture and Patterns.\u201d The store also offers souvenirs in the form of sturdy totes, practical pouches, book racks, stationery and clothing. cowbooks.jp", "description": "Cleo Le-Tan, whose tome \u201cA Booklover\u2019s Guide to New York\u201d is out in October, shares her favorite places to buy fashion books around the world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-EZ022_BOOKST_SOC_20190913124316.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
