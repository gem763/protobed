Wu also said Taiwan \u201crejects and strongly condemns\u201d Kiribati for disregarding the long-standing relationship and aid provided by Taiwan, reported CNA.\n\nTaiwan made the announcement before the Kiribati government formally announced its decision to cut ties with Taiwan in a pre-emptive move, as it did ahead of the Solomon Islands announcing their switch.\n\nThe move will be a \u201csignificant blow\u201d to Taiwan, says Jonathan Pryke, director of the Lowy Institute\u2019s Pacific Islands Program. Self-ruled Taiwan has lost seven allies since 2016 since the election of president, Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election in January amid rising tension with China.\n\n\u201cAnother one bites the dust in the Pacific,\u201d said Pryke. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not a good week for Taiwan, losing two of your remaining 17 diplomatic allies in one week, and two with the largest populations in the Pacific.\u201d\n\nTaiwan has been a de facto sovereign nation since the end of a civil war in 1949, but China still views the island as its territory and has vowed to bring it under central control. Taiwan is self-ruled, but China considers it a wayward province and will not have diplomatic relations with any country that recognises Taiwan as a state.\n\nOver the decades, dozens of countries, including the US and most western nations, have switched recognition to Beijing, leaving just a handful of countries loyal to Taiwan, largely in Latin America and the Pacific.\n\nThe south Pacific has been a diplomatic stronghold for Taiwan, where, until this week, formal ties with six island nations made up more than a third of its total alliances.\n\nKiribati (pronounced Kiribas), a country of 115,000 people in the south Pacific, was the largest of Taiwan\u2019s Pacific allies in terms of population after the Solomon Islands, a country of about 600,000 people, cut ties with the country earlier this week.\n\nKiribati\u2019s decision leaves Taiwan with four remaining Pacific allies: Tuvalu, Nauru, Palau and Marshall Islands as well as allies in the Caribbean and Latin America.\n\nChina\u2019s concerted attempt to peel allies away from Taipei could be seen putting pressure on Tsai, who is pro-Taiwanese sovereignty, ahead of the upcoming election in Taiwan in January.\n\nAfter the Solomon Islands cut ties with Taiwan, the US said it would consider cutting aid to the Solomon Islands in retribution.\n\nGloria Steele, acting assistant administrator of USAID\u2019s Asia bureau, told a House budget hearing: \u201cWe are reassessing our assistance to the Solomon Islands at this point.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting this is the hill the US has decided to die on in the Pacific,\u201d said Pryke. \u201cFor one, it\u2019s a pretty hypocritical position for them to be taking, considering they don\u2019t recognise Taiwan, they recognise China. But also, the US gives a paltry sum of money to the Solomon Islands; according to Lowy Institute Pacific Aid Map data they gave 0.3% of all foreign aid from 2011-2017 \u2026 I think they\u2019d be laughing at it in [the Solomon Islands\u2019 capital of] Honiara considering the lack of engagement they\u2019ve got from the US to date.\u201d", "description": "Pacific nation changes allegiance to Beijing just days after Solomon Islands also cut ties with Taipei", "authors": ["Kate Lyons"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc4c13431b0de5c9822d6f2ccff7f8f843481249/0_2429_3234_1939/master/3234.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3a29d0bb8766087261621670fe48fd27", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
