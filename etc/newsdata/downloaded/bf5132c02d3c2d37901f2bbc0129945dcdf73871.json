If Lew kept the old signature, it would have looked like this on the dollar bill\n\nLew, 57, \u2018has my complete trust\u2019, Obama said, arguing that the former White House budget director was the best man to help stabilize the US economy, not least because he had helped negotiate bipartisan deals in the 1980s.\n\n\u2018Jack has the distinction of having worked and succeeded in some of the toughest jobs in Washington and the private sector,\u2019 he said, citing Lew's work as a senior aide to legendary former House Speaker Thomas \u2018Tip\u2019 O'Neill and as budget director in the Clinton administration.\n\n\u2018As a congressional staffer in the 1980s, he helped negotiate the deal between President Reagan and Tip O'Neill to save Social Security. Under President Clinton, he presided over three budget surpluses in a row.\n\n\u2018So for all the talk out there about deficit reduction, making sure our books are balanced, this is the guy who did it three times,\u2019 as Lew and Geithner stood beside him.\n\nCommon problem: Lew wisecracked that he did not know that he shared a 'common challenge with outgoing Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, left, who had a similarly bad signature\n\nOld version: Outgoing Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner used to have a signature like the one seen here\n\nCurrently, the $20 bill features the face of seventh US president Andrew Jackson, who became much maligned due to this treatment of Native Americans\n\nObama said that a big reason for Lew's ability to get things done in Washington was that he was \u2018a low-key guy who prefers to surround himself with policy experts rather than television cameras\u2019 and grandstanding.\n\n\u2018Over the years he's built a reputation as a master of policy who can work with members of both parties and forge principled compromises. Jack has my complete trust. I know I'm not alone in that.\"\n\nSpeaking after Obama, Lew said he dreamed of \u2018making a difference in the world\u2019 as a child being raised Queens, New York, and he had been doing that in the Obama administration.\n\n\u2018It's really been a privilege to come to work every day as part of a team that's dedicated to building a sound economy and a safer world.\u2019\n\nLew also joked about his bizarre signature comprised of a series of loops, pictures of which spread virally across the Internet on Wednesday after news broke of his impending nomination.\n\nHe said that \u2018it was only yesterday that I discovered that we both share a common challenge with penmanship\u2019. Geithner has said he had to modify his own signature to make it readable on the currency.\n\nThe Senate is widely expected to confirm Lew as Treasury Secretary after already having confirmed him as budget director in 2010. Some Republicans, however, already are raising concerns that Lew's nomination signals Obama will be unwilling to agree to more deficit reduction.\n\nLew, 57, was managing director for Citigroup from July 2006 until the end of 2008, when he joined the Obama administration.\n\nA SIGN FOR SORE EYES: WHO DO THESE ODD SIGNATURES BELONG TO?\n\nCan you guess who these other bizarre signatures belong to? 1.
