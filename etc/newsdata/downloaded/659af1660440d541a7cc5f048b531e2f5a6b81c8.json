Our campaign gets its legs (and its heart!) from our network of FUNda Leaders who create opportunities every day for South African children to fall in love with books,\u201d Jade said.\n\nThe award comes after high praise from the DG Murray Trust and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) who supported Nal\u2019ibali in their quest to earn this award.\n\nDr. David Harrison, Chief Executive Officer of the DG Murray Trust reiterated his confidence in Nal\u2019ibali\u2019s vision of promoting literacy development through a culturally relevant, aspirational and effective campaign.\n\n\"Nal\u2019ibali\u2019s core aim is to spark and embed a culture of reading for enjoyment across South Africa, making reading, writing and sharing stories \u2013 in all South African languages \u2013 part of everyday life. The need in South Africa is dire. The 2016 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) revealed that 8 out of 10 nine-year olds in the country are unable to read for meaning in any language,\" says Harrison.\n\nTo date, Nal\u2019ibali has distributed over 30 million newspaper reading supplements, circulated almost 500 000 books, trained over 13 000 people to spark the joy of reading and reach millions of children through its World Read Aloud Day campaigns.\n\nWe'd say the recognition is well-earned.\n\nFor more information about the Nal\u2019ibali campaign, or to access children\u2019s stories in a range of South African languages, visit www.nalibali.org.
