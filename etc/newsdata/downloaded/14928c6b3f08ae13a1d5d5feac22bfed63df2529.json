A report released on Thursday by the Asia New Zealand Foundation questioned whether New Zealand had allowed its relationship with Japan to \u201cdrift\u201d, with more attention now being paid to China.\n\n\u201cPerhaps we have taken the relationship with Japan a little bit for granted,\u201d said the foundation\u2019s executive director Simon Draper. Japan is New Zealand\u2019s fourth-largest trading partner and worth NZ$8.8bn (\u00a34.45bn) per year.\n\nArdern is in Japan to discuss trade and tourism with the prime minister Shinzo Abe. She will also watch an All Blacks game at the Rugby World Cup.\n\nArdern is on the first leg of an overseas trip that will next take her to the UN leaders general assembly meeting in New York, where she will give the keynote speech at the climate action summit.\n\nWhile in New York, Ardern will hold her first ever formal meeting with Donald Trump and given the pair\u2019s chequered history she will no doubt be keen to avoid any further diplomatic muddles.\n\nIn November 2017, one month after Ardern took office, Trump allegedly mistook her for the wife of Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau at the east Asia summit in Vietnam.\n\nArdern later apologised for indiscreetly discussing the incident with a friend. The friend \u2013 comedian Tom Sainsbury \u2013 revealed in a radio interview that Ardern had told her Trump was \u201cnot as orange in real life\u201d.", "description": "New Zealand PM blames jet lag after hailing \u2018relationship with China \u2013 excuse me sorry, with Japan\u2019", "authors": ["Angela Cuming"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/885f2d0042afa8c0acd232bbb7d5251fc1a065b5/268_650_3156_1894/master/3156.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4c96795c546dc079a1c55610667a2705", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
