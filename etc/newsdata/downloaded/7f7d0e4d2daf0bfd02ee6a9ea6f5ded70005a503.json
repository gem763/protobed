I think we are losing something. It\u2019s very weird, you think VAR is helping football but then it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nAsked about Deulofeu\u2019s appeal for a spot-kick, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s a penalty, I have no idea (why it wasn\u2019t given).\u201d\n\nThe Spaniard also rued the fact that his side, who remain bottom of the table, could not take all the points after a mature display against last season\u2019s Champions League finalists.\n\n\u201cI think we deserved the three points because in the end we didn\u2019t concede very clear chances,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to come here and control the game. All we could do was defend well and limit the opponent and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d\n\nTottenham coach Mauricio Pochettino said the mistake on the VAR screen had nothing to do with his club and was a Premier League issue.\n\nHe also said the way his side managed to salvage a point might help steer them back on course after a rotten run, including a 7-2 thrashing at the hands of Bayern Munich and a 3-0 loss to Brighton and Hove Albion.\n\n\u201cAfter Bayern our confidence was on the floor. It was so important the way we achieved the point in the end, we kept fighting,\u201d Pochettino said.\n\n\u201cI hope this is the first step we need to build our confidence again.\u201d", "description": "Watford coach Quique Sanchez Flores said he is losing his faith in VAR as a force for good in the game after two decisive decisions went against his side in Saturday's 1-1 draw at Tottenham Hotspur, leaving them still without a win this season.", "authors": ["Richard Martin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442744992&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0IE", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
