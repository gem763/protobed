They have not forgotten about you.\n\nWashington today is largely focused on \u201cgreat power\u201d competition. What\u2019s next in the trade war with China or the tug of war with Russia? What\u2019s up with North Korea\u2019s missiles and the ayatollah in Iran?\n\nOf course, these struggles do matter. And America must stay on top of what these mighty but misguided nations are up to.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that we, our friends and our allies can afford to lower our guard against the terrorists lurking in the shadowlands who still seek to establish an Islamist dictatorship over a third of the Earth.\n\nThese terrorists have more than amply demonstrated their willingness to advance their cause, no matter how many innocents they may slaughter or sacrileges they may commit along the way.\n\nSure, there is no doubt that ISIS has taken a beating. Losing half of its self-proclaimed caliphate was deeply humiliating. Meanwhile, the U.S. and its allies continue to hunt down Al Qaeda\u2019s leadership and operatives.\n\nYet even a scattered and humbled enemy is still an enemy. The fundamental hate driving the Islamists burns fiercely still. Their terrorism isn\u2019t rooted in poverty, oppression, religious fervor or social injustice.\n\nRather, their terrorism is rooted in the rejection of the modern world and its promise of individual liberty and tolerance. As long as there is modernity, these haters will hate \u2013 and they won\u2019t stop trying to hurt the rest of us.\n\nCommitted vigilance is essential, because we don\u2019t know where the terrorists will try to strike next.\n\nThe Easter church bombings in Sri Lanka this year were a horrifying reminder that no place is out of bounds. ISIS is happy to kill anywhere, in any numbers, to demonstrate it is still a force to be reckoned with.\n\nA recent report by the United Nations concluded that ISIS could have tens of millions of dollars in cash reserves. Or not. Nor do we know where all the foreign fighters who flocked to the \u201ccaliphate\u201d are now hiding. Or what their plans are.\n\nAlso unclear is where the Islamist insurgency\u2019s next base of operations will be established. Syria remains a contender: some rebel forces that control territory in Idlib recently aligned with Al Qaeda.\n\nIn addition, both Al Qaeda and ISIS are operating in Yemen. And ISIS recently staged a high-profile, bloody bombing in Kabul in Afghanistan.\n\nTerrorists also still roam throughout Southeast Asia. Then there is the Sahel, where Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) operates. And in West Africa the Islamic State in Greater Sahara (ISGS) has become one of ISIS\u2019s most active affiliates.\n\nThe terrorists are not just a problem in the top half of Africa. ISIS also recently claimed credit for attacks in Mozambique and the Congo. Meanwhile, the U.S. is bombing Al Shabaab, Al-Qaeda\u2019s Somali affiliate.\n\nIn short, America can\u2019t take its eyes off terrorists.\n\nWashington can\u2019t get so wrapped up in competing with other nations that it loses interest or the capacity to manage the problem of non-state enemies. Indeed, we ought to anticipate that some hostile states will try to sponsor \u2013 or at least enable \u2013 transnational terrorists as another weapon to be used against us.\n\nThe global war on terrorism might be over, but the global watch, response, and preventative action campaign has to continue.\n\nThe U.S. must also figure out how dealing with domestic terrorism fits in. It is hard not to conclude that the left\u2019s obsession with domestic right-wing extremists is more rooted in political opportunism than public safety.\n\nPeople on the left were always uncomfortable with the war on terror. They fretted that it was an affront to Muslims everywhere and a threat to civil liberties anywhere. They are, on the other hand, ready to unleash all the resources of counterterrorism on anyone associated with the other half of the political spectrum here at home.\n\nIt is true that America has recently suffered more from domestic terrorists \u2013 on both sides of the political spectrum \u2013 than from the transnational Islamist terrorist movement. But that\u2019s because the U.S. has done such a remarkable job stifling overseas threats before they get here \u2013 not because the government has turned a blind eye to domestic terror threats.\n\nWhat we need to do is put the politics aside, and show a little maturity and proportionality on how we address terrorist threats.\n\nOver the last decade, the U.S. developed a remarkable capacity to address terrorism, and managed to do so without impinging on the civil liberties of Americans, as many feared. What we need to do is to continue to apply resources with prudence and determination and not be distracted by geopolitics or Washington\u2019s politics.", "description": "This is a warning to the civilized world: Don\u2019t forget about the supporters of Usama bin Laden and the\u00a0ISIS\u00a0caliphate.
