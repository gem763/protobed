It is big, grand, on hundreds of acres, next to MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, has tremendous ballrooms & meeting rooms, and each delegation would have its own 50 to 70 unit building. Would set up better than other alternatives. I announced that I would be willing to do it at NO PROFIT or, if legally permissible, at ZERO COST to the USA. But, as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!\u201d\n\n\u2026..its own 50 to 70 unit building. Would set up better than other alternatives.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2019\n\nOn Thursday, Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters Trump National Doral had been chosen to host the event.\n\nMulvaney downplayed the notion Trump will benefit financially from hosting the summit.\n\n\u201cI was aware of the political criticism,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t\u2019 profit from being [president],\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons he\u2019s not taken a salary since he\u2019s been here. He\u2019s given that salary to charity.\u201d\n\nThe chief of staff added the resort offered to host at a much less expensive rate than other potential sites \u2014 nearly 50 percent less.\n\nAnother candidate venue had been Mackinac Island in Michigan. The event is scheduled for next June 10-12.\n\nThe United States last hosted the G7 summit in 2012 at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland.\n\nHouse Democrats are expected to vote Tuesday in support of a resolution condemning President Trump\u2019s decision to hold the event at Doral, though the full text of the non-binding measure has yet to be released.\n\nThe UPI contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump announced Saturday evening that Trump National Doral Miami will no longer host next year's G-7 summit.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Doral-Resort-for-G-7-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
