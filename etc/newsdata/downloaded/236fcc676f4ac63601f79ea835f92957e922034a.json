I\u2019m sincere in regretting that she\u2019s not continuing her campaign.\n\nCramer, 67, appeared last week at a community forum and rejected out of hand the notion that there could be value in attracting a diverse population to her town, not far from the Canadian border and about 55 miles northeast of Detroit. Her racist response to the moderator\u2019s question stunned many in the audience and made national headlines.\n\n\u201cMy suggestion, recommendation: Keep Marysville a white community as much as possible,\u201d she said, without a trace of self-awareness to the insensitivity of her comment. \u201cWhite. Seriously. In other words, no foreign-born, no foreign people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a weekend of condemnation from embarrassed townsfolk and a barrage of negative attention from the national media, Cramer submitted written notification to the city withdrawing from the council race. Officials for Marysville in a Facebook post wrote that Cramer\u2019s name would remain on the ballot, because her withdrawal occurred after the April 26 deadline set by the State Elections Board.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Mayor Dan Damman applauded Cramer\u2019s decision to stop embarrassing the city.\n\n\u201cI had publicly asked her to withdraw the day after she made the initial statement, and public sentiment from our residents was swift and bold as they rejected her ideology,\u201d Damman wrote in an email to CNN. \u201cIt is my sincere hope that she withdrew because she recognized that her belief system and ideology have no place in public service; not in Marysville, not anywhere.\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s mayor pro tem, Kathy Hayman, was apoplectic about Cramer\u2019s comments, saying that she took them personally because her late father was a Syrian-born immigrant who ran a business and held elected office in the community for years. In fact, the very room that the meeting took place was named to honor her father, Joseph Johns.\n\n\u201cSo basically, what you\u2019ve said is that my father and his family had no business to be in this community,\u201d Hayman told Cramer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA reporter for the Port Huron Times-Herald approached her after the forum to ask if she wanted to clarify her earlier comments and respond to Hayman. She obliged by saying more racist and xenophobic things.\n\n\u201cAs long as, how can I put this? What Kathy Hayman doesn\u2019t know is that her family is in the wrong,\u201d she told the reporter. \u201cHusband and wife need to be the same race. Same thing with kids. That\u2019s how it\u2019s been from the beginning of, how can I say, when God created the heaven and the earth. He created Adam and Eve at the same time. But as far as me being against blacks, no I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nWhile I find Cramer\u2019s views repugnant, they are refreshingly honest and void of the mealy-mouth comments so often uttered by poll-tested politicians. Indeed, Cramer seemed more than willing to defend her racist views in follow-up interviews with local media. Maybe she would have stood by her comments to the bitter end, if not pressed out of the race.\n\nBut such is not to be. Without Cramer on the hustings, there\u2019s no way to know how the denizens of Maryville would have ultimately responded to her views. It\u2019s something every American might have dearly benefitted from knowing and understanding, especially in this racially fraught political moment.\n\nTo be clear, I would have loved to have heard Cramer debate her views and defend so overtly a racist opinion during the campaign. What\u2019s more, I\u2019m curious to know just how much support Cramer would have received in the community that\u2019s 95% white and located near the Canadian border about 55 miles northeast of Detroit.\n\nAfter all, she has lived in the community since 2012, according to property records. She was well-known enough to become a qualified candidate for the council, which means that a significant number of residents knew something about her public views. Presumably, many people in Marysville knew or shared her racist vision for the future of their town well enough to encourage her to run for office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI regret she\u2019s not continuing to campaign because hearing her views represents an excellent test of her city\u2019s values and a missed opportunity for those of us who don\u2019t live in Marysville to learn something real and candid about people who inhabit our nation.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1148479937.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
