Some detection mechanisms and sandboxes may whitelist such package names, in an effort to prevent wasting resources.\u201d\n\nThankfully, Google has now removed these apps from the Google Play Store, after ESET reported the issue.\n\nMr Stefanko added: \u201cSneaking unwanted or harmful functionality into popular, benign apps is a common practice among \u201cbad\u201d developers, and we are committed to tracking down such apps.\n\n\u201cWe report them to Google and take other steps to disrupt malicious campaigns we discover.\u201d\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nDangerous apps you should delete now\n\nSmart Gallery\n\nSaveInsta\n\nMini lite for Facebook\n\nFreed Radio FM Online\n\nFree Video Downloader\n\nFree Social Video Downloader\n\nFile Downloader\n\nWater Drink Reminder\n\nSmart Notes for You\n\nDU Recorder\n\nTank classic\n\nHeroes Jump\n\nSolucionario\n\nRingtone Maker\n\nVideo downloader\n\nRingtone Maker Pro\n\nBasketball Perfect Shot\n\nHikeTop+\n\nMP4 video downloader\n\nFlat Music Player\n\nFree Top Video Downloader", "description": "Researchers from ESET have warned users about 42 dangerous apps that were previously available on the Google Play Store that contain adware", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Bloomberg", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article11602471.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_The-Latest-Mobile-Apps-At-The-App-World-Multi-Platform-Developer-Show.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
