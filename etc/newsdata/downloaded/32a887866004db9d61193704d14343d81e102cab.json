Alex Schindelar, president of Energy Intelligence, said the Times' sponsorship drop accelerated plans to announce a conference\u2019s rebranding.\n\nEnergy Intelligence would like to announce that the Oil & Money conference will, from next year, be renamed the Energy Intelligence Forum. We are proud that the conference has been a platform for open and unbiased debate for the energy industry since 1979, and are committed to maintaining the standards and values that our delegates have come to expect. But the energy industry is changing, and as our conference program has evolved in recent years to address the challenges of climate change and the energy transition, we felt that our conference needed a new identity and a new mandate. The world needs energy, but the energy industry must find ways to meet those needs in a more sustainable way. The mission of the Energy Intelligence Forum will be to provide a place where energy leaders can come together to debate, collaborate and find low-carbon solutions for the world\u2019s energy challenges. We look forward to revealing details about the Energy Intelligence Forum at the Oil & Money conference, October 8-10 in London. Click here for further information on this year's conference.
