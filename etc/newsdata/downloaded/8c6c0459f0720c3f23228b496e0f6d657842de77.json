That\u2019s what we are thinking about, not about why the start has not been as you or Tottenham expected.\"\n\nHe added: \"From time to time, things don\u2019t work out. That\u2019s football.\n\n\"We saw in that midweek game, and even in the other games they had good moments.\n\n\"They didn\u2019t forget how to play football.\"", "description": "The 'Terminator' star is confident Jurgen Klopp's side will be able to continue their unbeaten start to the season on Sunday", "authors": ["Hassan Rashed", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Tolga Bozoglu Epa-Efe Rex", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20725078.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-ENTERTAINMENT-FILM-TERMINATOR-DARK-FATE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
