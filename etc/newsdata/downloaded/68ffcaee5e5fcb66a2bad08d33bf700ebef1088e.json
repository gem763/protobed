Joseph Caloiaro and Sgt. Scott Caloiaro, began requiring officers to not let any infraction off with a warning, according to NJ.com.\n\n\u201cThe advisement campaign is over. No more catch and release, revenue needs to go up,\u201d Lawrence Caloiaro allegedly said in March.\n\nThe suit also claimed cars would be impounded \u201cregardless of the criminal or motor vehicle offense\u201d and people were forced to pay $300 to retrieve their car which wouldn\u2019t be refunded regardless if they were found not guilty.\n\nThe suit states that an ATM in the impound lot\u2019s lobby was used by drivers to get cash, but would only dispense $200 at a time and charged high fees that went straight back to the township.\n\n\u201cTherefore, upon the issuance of a ticket, regardless of the guilt of a motorist, he/she is already required to pay the township close to $475 between impound fees and towing costs just to get his/her car back,\u201d the officers say in a court filing. \u201cThis is prior to a motorist being found guilty of an offense.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit states that if officers did not meet their quotas would be the target of \u201cfrivolous allegations and internal affairs complaints\u201d and put on the township\u2019s \u201chit list.\u201d\n\nOne officer even claimed that after he complained about the quota system, he had his assignments taken away and was \u201ctargeted for discipline and internal affairs investigations.\u201d\n\nLt. Joseph Caloiaro was also accused of abusing his power for chasing down, arresting and impounding the car of a driver who flipped him off.\n\nChief Caloiaro and the township did not respond to NJ.com for comment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
