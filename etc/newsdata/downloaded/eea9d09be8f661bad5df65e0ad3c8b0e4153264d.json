It might send the wrong signal, but it would certainly take a tool away from the Justice Department that it might to use in an individual case and for some reason. I don\u2019t know, there\u2019s some human trafficking component there. There might be some other reason why you want to prosecute somebody. But it is up to, I think, the Justice Department to use its discretion in an appropriate way.\u201d\n\nMr. Holder said he did not agree with many of the Trump administration\u2019s priorities, but that Democrats should concentrate on realistic and practical alternatives.\n\n\u201cI think that we need to look for solutions to the problems that we confront that are that are consistent with who were are as a party, consistent with the Democratic tradition, but also the kinds of things that we\u2019re going to be able to deliver to people,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t believe in government because they\u2019re promised so much and then we frequently don\u2019t deliver for them. So I hope that we\u2019ll just, as I said, realistic but consistent, again, with our progressive principles.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
