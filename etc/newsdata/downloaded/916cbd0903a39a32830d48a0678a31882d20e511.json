The online magazine recognized the award-winning director as a \u201ctrailblazer.\u201d\n\nDuVernay, whose Netflix limited series \u201cWhen They See Us\u201d told the stories of five Black and Latino men who were wrongly convicted of a brutal crime in New York\u2019s Central Park as teenagers, told Glamour that she hopes to \u201cdisrupt systems\u201d through her work.\n\n\u201cI am trying to disrupt systems \u2014 systems that we in this country take as gospel,\u201d the director said. \u201cWe\u2019re born into them. We abide by their rules without interrogating what the rules are meant to do, who they\u2019re meant to serve.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cAnd you can\u2019t disrupt what you don\u2019t understand. But once you understand, perhaps you engage with these things differently, no matter who you are. Perhaps you don\u2019t assume that, because it\u2019s a longstanding institution, it is right and fair, and you interrogate for yourself what you\u2019ve been taught and told, and you learn to relearn for yourself.\u201d\n\nI understood early on that it\u2019s about more than just one movie. https://t.co/k8Zh5cluna \u2014 Ava DuVernay (@ava) October 23, 2019\n\n\u201cWhen They See Us\u201d put the spotlight on the Exonerated 5 \u2015 Korey Wise, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana Jr., Yusef Salaam and Antron McCray \u2015 powerfully exposing how institutional injustices and racist sentiments in the public changed the trajectory of their lives. All five served time behind bars. Their convictions were vacated in 2002 after DNA evidence and a confession linked a convicted murderer and serial rapist to the Central Park crime.\n\nThe Emmy-winning series, which premiered on May 31, became the most-watched series on Netflix.\n\nDuVernay, who has also directed such acclaimed projects as \u201cSelma,\u201d \u201c13th\u201d and \u201cA Wrinkle in Time,\u201d told Glamour that when it comes to \u201cWhen They See Us,\u201d she doesn\u2019t focus on the fact that it scored 16 Emmy nominations.\n\n\u201cI think of the day that the men wept in my arms and I wept in theirs as they told me that I told their story better than they could have imagined,\u201d she said.\n\nGlamour\u2019s other 2019 honorees are activist Greta Thunberg, actors Charlize Theron and Yara Shahidi, soccer star Megan Rapinoe, writer Margaret Atwood, fashion designer Tory Burch and the women of RAICES, an organization that provides free and low-cost legal services to underserved immigrant families and refugees.\n\nRead DuVernay\u2019s entire interview with Glamour here.", "description": "\"I am trying to disrupt systems \u2013 systems that we in this country take as gospel,\" the \"When They See Us\" director said.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db0a065210000da28ad3b57.jpeg?cache=ppfeuaoqt7&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
