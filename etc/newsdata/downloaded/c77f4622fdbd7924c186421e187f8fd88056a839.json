Will Hurd speaks at a news conference on Capitol Hill, February 13, 2019. (Erin Scott/Reuters)\n\nThe spate of retiring Lone Star State Republican representatives is indicative of the GOP\u2019s weakening grasp on its most important bastion of support.\n\n\u2018I am a classically trained engineer,\u201d says Representative Will Hurd, a Texas Republican, \u201cand I firmly believe in regression to the mean.\u201d Applying a concept from statistics to the randomness of today\u2019s politics is problematic. In any case, Hurd, 42, is not waiting for the regression of our politics from the extreme ends of the ideological spectrum to something like temperate normality. He is leaving Congress at the end of this, his third term. And he sees portents that his blinkered party would be prudent to notice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHurd is one of six Texas Republican congressman who have decided not to seek reelection next year. Until this year, none of them had, since 2011, experienced the purgatory of being in the House minority. In the 2018 \u201cTexodus,\u201d five Texas Republican representatives retired (a sixth resigned) and two were defeated. Of the 241 Republicans in the House when Donald Trump was inaugurated, almost 40 percent are gone or going. See a trend?\n\nHurd, who is not foreswearing public life, insists, \u201cI\u2019m just getting started.\u201d Might he come back to electoral politics? \u201cFor sure.\u201d His \u201cpassion\u201d is \u201cthe nexus between technology and national security.\u201d He is, however, saying goodbye to the rigors of the \u201cDC to DQ\u201d tours that have regularly taken him to the far reaches of his district. For you effete coastal residents who are unfamiliar with the delights of flyover country, DQ means Dairy Queen. Hurd meets gatherings of constituents at DQs because \u201cevery town has one and everyone knows where they are.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2018, he was one of just three Republicans to win a district carried by Hillary Clinton. (She won his by three points.) His House race was the nation\u2019s fourth-most competitive: He won by 926 votes. But, then, his largest victory, in 2016, was by just 3,051 votes. His district, which includes 23 percent of Texas\u2019 land and extends from San Antonio\u2019s fringe to New Mexico\u2019s border, is the state\u2019s largest, encompassing all or parts of 29 counties and 820 miles of the U.S.\u2013Mexico border. It is 58,000 square miles \u2014 almost as big as Georgia and larger than Illinois and 25 other states. It is 69 percent Hispanic, and just 4 percent African American.\n\nHurd, an articulate, assertive 6\u20194\u2033 former CIA operative, and the only African-American Republican in the House, thinks voting trends \u201care moving so fast\u201d that 2020 \u201chas nothing to do with 2016.\u201d Just as \u201cU.S. economic and military dominance are no longer guaranteed,\u201d neither is Republican dominance in Texas, a state that is hardly immune to national trends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the 2016 U.S House of Representatives elections, no Republican incumbent from Texas lost and only one was elected with less than 55 percent. In 2018, two lost and ten received less than 55 percent. In 2016, four incumbent Republicans in Texas\u2019 House were defeated and only four won with majorities under 55 percent. In 2018, there were eight losers and 16 won with less than 55 percent. John Cornyn, who recently stepped down as the second-highest Republican leader (majority whip) in the U.S. Senate, has won three terms with majorities of 55.3 percent, 54.8 percent, and 61.6 percent but seems headed for a more competitive race next year. No wonder Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, says Texas is \u201cground zero\u201d for Democratic attempts to strengthen their hold on the House.\n\nNationally, Republicans are decreasingly strong where two generations ago they were especially robust \u2014 in suburbs. Texas ranks high among the states in terms of the percentage of the population that is suburban. And statewide, whites are a minority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2008, with the Great Recession under way, John McCain carried Texas by twelve points. In 2012, Mitt Romney carried it by 16. In 2016, Trump (whom Hurd did not endorse) won by nine points. In Texas\u2019s most important 2018 contest for a federal office, incumbent Republican senator Ted Cruz won by just three. See a trend?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the Democratic party can collect Texas\u2019s electoral votes \u2014 38 today, perhaps 41 after the 2020 census \u2014 as well as California\u2019s 55, it will reap 35.5 percent of a winning 270 from just two states. Then the GOP will have almost no plausible path to 270, and Democrats who are currently hot to abolish the Electoral College will suddenly say: Oh, never mind.\n\nAnd Hurd will repeat what he says today: Texas is \u201calready purple.\u201d Republicans \u201chave to get out of our own way\u201d because \u201cif the Republican party in Texas does not start looking like Texas there will not be a Republican party in Texas.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00a9 2019, Washington Post Writers Group", "description": "The spate of retiring Texas Republican representatives is indicative of the GOP\u2019s weakening grasp on its most important bastion of support.", "authors": ["George Will", "Jim Geraghty", "Alexandra Desanctis", "David French", "Mona Charen", "Rich Lowry", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Mairead Mcardle", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Read More"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/will-hurd-capitol-hill.jpg?fit=1200%2C700&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
