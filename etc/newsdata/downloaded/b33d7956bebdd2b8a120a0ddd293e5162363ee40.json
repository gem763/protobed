Its website calls it a \u201cconscious entrepreneurial school,\u201d offering students mentorship from WeWork employees, weekly trips to a farm, daily meditation and yoga, while preaching lofty goals about nurturing students\u2019 souls.\n\nHuffPost spoke with several people close to the school in the past few weeks to get a better sense of the institution. They described a school that is run like the company of WeWork, subject to constant changes or \u201cdisruption,\u201d sometimes without full consideration for the children these changes impact. However, they also described an idealistic learning space, where children for the most part seem to be happy and thriving. According to one former employee, the company recently redesigned part of the school, which they speculated cost up to several million dollars (a spokesperson for WeWork did not respond to questions about this).\n\nThe school is a casualty of the company\u2019s new efforts to downsize after the implosion of its planned public offering and a staggering reduction in its valuation. The past few weeks have been chaotic for the company, which rents out shared workspaces to businesses and entrepreneurs. Its CEO and co-founder Adam Neumann stepped down and there are rumors of mass layoffs that could impact thousands of employees.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nWeWork CEO Adam Neumann Steps Down Amid Failed Stock Sale\n\nWeWork Withdraws Stock Market IPO Filing\n\nAmid the chaos, WeGrow parents wondered whether the school would even make it through the year, lining up backup options in case of an abrupt shuttering.\n\n\u201cParents and administrators are exploring all options to keep WeGrow open,\u201d said parent Jessica Ducroux on Friday morning.\n\nThe school was the brainchild of WeWork co-founder and chief brand and impact officer Rebekah Neumann, who served as the school\u2019s CEO before stepping down from her roles at the company with her husband, Adam. Indeed, WeGrow mimicked WeWork, as the school\u2019s day to day was sometimes rejiggered on short notice, which could be incompatible with the needs of children, sources said.\n\nThe WeWork spokesperson did not comment on this characterization of school life at WeGrow. A representative for the Neumanns did not immediately have comment.\n\nBut by its second year, the school\u2019s enrollment had grown to about 100 students, including a number of children whose parents worked for the company. In 2018, Rebekah Neumann called the school \u2015 and the ability to bring company employees closer to their children \u2015 part of WeWork\u2019s core goals, according to CNN.\n\n\u201cWe want to make a world where people can work to make a life and not just a living, but that\u2019s part of a larger, more holistic mission to elevate the world\u2019s consciousness, to create a world where people are happy and fulfilled and living in a sharing state,\u201d she said.\n\nIndeed, the school employs staffers with titles like \u201ccreative expressions manager\u201d and \u201cmanager of wisdom cultures.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, teachers have worked to shield kids from the disarray enveloping the larger company, according to a WeGrow parent. This parent praised the school for nurturing children\u2019s social-emotional development, as opposed to perpetuating a rat race focused on test scores and achievement, and worries that the school\u2019s true successes \u2015 its focus on mindfulness and community building \u2015 will be overshadowed by schadenfreude over WeWork\u2019s shortcomings.\n\nThe school \u2015 like WeWork spaces \u2015 emphasizes design, and is complete with \u201cmodular classrooms, tree houses and a vertical farm,\u201d per the school\u2019s website.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Since 2018, the troubled office space company has operated an expensive private school in Manhattan.", "authors": ["Rebecca Klein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pvISqrn.lKQull4JXuGSvw--~B/aD0yMjU4O3c9NDAxNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9f8fd9210000e706343d7f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
