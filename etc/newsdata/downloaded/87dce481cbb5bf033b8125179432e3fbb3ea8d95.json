(Sarel van der Walt)\n\nDA leader Mmusi Maimane has congratulated former leader Helen Zille on her successful election as the party's new federal council chairperson.\n\nThe DA announced that Zille beat out other candidates Athol Trollip, Mike Waters and Thomas Walters to replace party veteran James Selfe in the important post as head of the party's internal machinery.\n\nThe party's 155 delegates met this weekend for a crucial federal council meeting, where the open vacancy and an all-important election results review report was among the agenda items.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, Maimane said the election of a new chairperson of the Federal Council presented an opportunity for renewal and change for the DA.\n\n\"I want to congratulate Helen Zille on her election as Chairperson of Federal Council, and I look forward to the new energy, ideas and vigour that Helen will bring to the leadership collective of the party,\" he said.\n\n\"Helen has served the party in various positions over the past years, and brings experience and political clout second to none.\n\n#DAFesCo Maimane now briefing the media.

The election and campaigns are over, and now is the time to unite behind our common purpose.\"\n\nMaimane also reserved words of praise for Zille's predecessor, who had served in the post for 19 years. He takes up a new position in the party as head of its new governance unit.\n\n\"The position was previously occupied by James Selfe, who chaired FedCo for just under 20 years with the utmost distinction. I want to again thank James for his leadership, support and friendship. James is an unsung hero of South Africa\u2019s democratic project and his valiant work has positively shaped our country.\"\n\nDA review recommendations adopted\n\nMaimane said the party had adopted 13 key recommendations based on a review panel report compiled by former leader Tony Leon, former policy head Ryan Coetzee, and Capitec founder Michiel Le Roux.\n\nAmong the recommendations included for the DA to hold an early elective congress \"as soon as constitutionally possible\" - a year before it is due.\n\n\"We want to go to congress in 2020 before local government elections in 2021,\" Maimane said on Sunday.\n\nThe recommendations also included that Zille - in her new role - establish a policy review committee, with a view to the party holding a \"policy conference\".\n\n#DAFedCo Zille says she will stay on her lane.
