Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nSix hours after lawmakers began grilling Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on his cryptocurrency plans, House members from both sides of the aisle expressed dissatisfaction with the lengthy testimony. Zuckerberg took questions from the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, three months after David Marcus, Facebook's cryptocurrency chief, failed in his testimony to give politicians confidence that the company would wait for a regulatory structure before launching its libra project. The top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee didn't see much advanced by Zuckerberg. \"Frankly, I'm not sure that we've learned anything new here,\" said ranking member Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., as the Facebook CEO wrapped up his testimony. That view was shared by several members of the committee, who had called on Zuckerberg to testify about the company's plans with libra. Last week, Facebook announced the 21 founding members of the crypto project as the group met in Switzerland to sign onto the Libra Association charter, which will govern the libra cryptocurrency. In June, Facebook announced plans for libra to transform the way money moves around the world and said it would be run by a nonprofit association supported by a range of companies and organizations. But Zuckerberg struggled to satisfy House members, who are concerned about regulation and the governance structure surrounding libra.", "description": "Members of the House questioned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for over six hours on Wednesday and weren't particularly satisfied with the answers.", "authors": ["Lauren Feiner"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106198621-1571843413479gettyimages-1177730202.jpeg?v=1571843436", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
