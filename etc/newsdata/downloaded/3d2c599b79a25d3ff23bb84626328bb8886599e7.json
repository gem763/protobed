It triggered a build-up of plaque around the rim of his tongue.\n\nThe unusual oral symptom is called uraemic stomatitis, and has barely been reported in scientific literature before.\n\nAn unnamed man lost his sense of taste and had smelly breath when plaque (pictured) built up on his tongue due to a rare kidney condition\n\nBecause waste was not being filtered by the kidneys, a 'chemical irritant' was formed in the mouth, which caused the membranes of the tongue to go white\n\nDr Hiroyuki Yano and Dr Mitsuyo Kinjo Medicine, of Okinawa Chubu Hospital, Uruma, detailed the story in BMJ Case Reports.\n\nOn arrival, the man was alert, but said he had been suffering with fatigue, a lack of taste and no appetite for a while. Doctors said: 'White plaque on the rim of tongue was notable.'\n\nThey swiftly conducted laboratory tests which looked at levels of sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphate, nitrogen and various other chemicals in the body.\n\nHe had abnormally high levels of urea nitrogen in the blood, a condition called uraemia.\n\nWHAT CAUSED THE MAN'S TONGUE TO GO WHITE? The man had kidney failure due to an unknown cause\n\nTherefore, chemical waste was not being flushed from his body properly\n\nElevated levels of urea nitrogen were in his blood, tests showed\n\nIt wasn't being broken down by the saliva properly, which created a compound called ammonia\n\nThis acted as a chemical irritant to the mucus on the tongue and mouth\n\nThe body forms urea nitrogen, a chemical waste product, in the liver, which travels to the kidneys through the bloodstream.\n\nHealthy kidneys filter urea and remove other waste products from the blood, which leave the body through urine.\n\nIf urea nitrogen levels are high, it signals that the kidneys, or liver, are failing to function.\n\nThe saliva is unable to break down the excess urea nitrogen, creating ammonia, which is a 'chemical irritant' in the mouth, the doctors explained.\n\nThis forms oral lesions or 'plaques' which are painful and white in colour, and a bad breath - sometimes which smells similar to urine.\n\nA CT scan showed both kidneys were smaller than usual indicating long-lasting kidney failure. At this stage, it was unclear why or when the man had got kidney failure.\n\nThe man's tongue returned to normal after treatment. He needs to continue haemodialysis three times a week, however\n\nExposure to environmental pollutants, toxins or certain medications, severe dehydration or chronic disease can lead to kidney failure.\n\nThe doctors noted the man had smoked five cigarettes per day for 17 years. Smoking lowers blood flow to important organs like the kidneys and can make kidney disease worse.\n\nAround one in 50 people will progress from chronic kidney disease to kidney failure, according to the NHS.\n\nDespite symptoms of kidney failure including irregular heartbeat and swelling of the legs, ankles and feet, the man had none of these.\n\nTreatment was started straight away, including haemodialysis, which removes excess waste from the body, effectively replacing the job of failed kidneys.\n\nWithin a week, the patient's appetite and taste returned to normal, and the white patches on his tongue disappeared, the doctors said,\n\nHe needs to continue haemodialysis three times a week, however.\n\nThe doctors wrote: 'Uraemic stomatitis is a rare complication of advanced renal failure.'\n\nThe number of people who are affected by uremia stomatitis or uraemia is unclear.", "description": "The Japanese man was found to have high levels of chemical waste in his blood, signalling\u00a0kidney failure, which reacted with mucus in his mouth.
