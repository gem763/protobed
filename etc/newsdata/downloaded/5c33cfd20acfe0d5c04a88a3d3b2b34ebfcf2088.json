They seemed meant to tamp down questions about Giuliani\u2019s status with a client famous for distancing himself from advisers when they encounter legal problems of their own.\n\nTrump, during a Saturday night appearance on Fox News, called Giuliani \u201ca great gentleman\u201d and said he is still his lawyer. \u201cI know nothing about him being under investigation. I can\u2019t imagine it,\u201d he told the host Jeanine Pirro.\n\nBefore the lunch, Giuliani and Trump spoke on the phone, according to two people familiar with the discussions. Also beforehand, Trump praised Giuliani on Twitter as a \u201clegendary \u2018crime buster\u2019 and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC.\u201d\n\nGiuliani \u201cmay seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer,\u201d the president\u2019s tweet continued.\n\nAnd Trump dismissed the investigation into Giuliani as a \u201ca one sided Witch Hunt\u201d carried out by the \u201cDeep State.\u201d\n\nThe president echoed language he had used to minimize the special counsel\u2019s investigation into whether he or his campaign worked with Russians who interfered in the 2016 election to try to help him win the presidency.\n\nGiuliani, a former federal prosecutor and New York mayor, was retained last year to help defend the president in the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nBut his efforts to undermine the investigation\u2019s origins and its conclusions helped lead Trump into an impeachment inquiry. The inquiry focuses on whether Trump, with assistance from Giuliani, abused the presidency to pressure Ukraine to pursue investigations for his political benefit, including into whether Ukrainians played a role in spurring the inquiry of the special counsel, Robert Mueller.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Manhattan are now investigating whether Giuliani\u2019s efforts in Ukraine may have run afoul of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, The New York Times reported Friday.\n\nGiuliani has defended his work in Ukraine and said it did not require him to register under FARA.\n\nTrump was not enamored with the negative publicity around Giuliani, people close to the president said, but he remains loyal because of his lawyer\u2019s willingness to aggressively defend him during the special counsel\u2019s inquiry.\n\nIt is not clear what was discussed at the lunch.\n\nThe lunch is unlikely to end speculation over whether the president will ultimately consider Giuliani a liability. Another of Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, Michael Cohen, met privately with the president in Florida in March 2018, a month before the FBI searched his home, hotel room and office. Trump publicly embraced Cohen, until it became clear he might speak against the president.\n\nA White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAsked over text message about the significance of the lunch, Giuliani directed a reporter to Trump\u2019s show of support on Twitter.\n\nHe said his relationship with Trump was \u201cthe same as ever\u201d but declined to answer additional questions, explaining he was watching the New York Yankees\u2019 playoff game against the Houston Astros.\n\nThe two people familiar with the discussions between Trump and Giuliani said they believed it would be difficult to prove that Giuliani violated FARA.\n\nThe law requires U.S. citizens to disclose to the Justice Department any contacts with the government or media in the United States at the direction or request of foreign politicians or government officials, regardless of whether they paid for the representation.\n\nGiuliani has acknowledged that he and two of his associates, who were arrested on campaign finance charges Wednesday, worked with Ukrainian prosecutors to collect potentially damaging information about targets of Trump and his allies, including a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and former Vice President Joe Biden and his younger son, Hunter Biden.\n\nGiuliani shared that material this year with U.S. government officials and a Trump-friendly columnist in an effort to undermine the ambassador and other Trump targets.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump had lunch Saturday with Rudy Giuliani amid revelations that prosecutors were investigating Giuliani for possible lobbying violations, and speculation that his position as the president's personal lawyer was in jeopardy.The lunch, at Trump's golf course in", "authors": ["Kenneth P.
