I told myself I could care less because I got bigger fish to fry,\" he said.\n\nChilton once worked as a poll clerk for the NDP, but lately he said he's been concerned about surviving.\n\nCBC News spoke with peer support worker Matthew Gaudet, Caroline Cox with Shepherds of Good Hope, and Robert Chilton, who recently became homeless, about the need for voting clinics geared toward Ottawa's homeless residents. 1:00\n\nThat's fairly typical of people with precarious housing, but government policies often have a huge impact on those people, said Matthew Gaudet, a peer worker with Inner City Health.\n\nThat's why Inner City Health set up a registration clinic in the soup kitchen for the first time.\n\nCase workers at the shelter regularly register their clients as voters, but workers at the shelter said this is a way to reach others in the community who may not sleep there.\n\nMatthew Gaudet with Ottawa Inner City Health said registering homeless people to vote is personal to him, as someone who once lived in a shelter. (Laura Osman/CBC)\n\n\"People are making decisions about their lives and how to spend money to help these people,\" Gaudet said.\n\n\"They should have a right to be able to vote for the people that are making decisions on their behalf.\"\n\nGetting informed a challenge\n\nElections Canada said there are few people studying the voter turnout of homeless people, but there's no doubt that group faces greater obstacles to voting.\n\nWithout a fixed address or government issued identification, registering is a challenge. Elections Canada provides some solutions, including letters declaring a shelter as a voter's address.\n\nThe person can also have someone vouch for them at the polling station.\n\nThat's why special registration clinics like the one at the Shepherds is so helpful, Gaudet said.\n\nHe was once homeless himself, and remembers what it was like casting his ballot after that experience.\n\n\"When I walked out of that polling station I felt like a person, like a citizen, again and I wanted to be able to give that same feeling to everyone else,\" he said.\n\nOf course, getting people registered is only half the battle. Helping people get informed about the issues is also a challenge.\n\nRobert Chilton said he's more concerned with survival than politics right now. (Laura Osman/CBC)\n\n\"If you don't have your laptop going or you don't have a television you kind of feel out of the loop,\" Chilton said.\n\nInner City Health put together a primer on party platforms, and the shelter has also invited candidates to come by the soup kitchen during the election.\n\nPeople on the street don't often talk about politics, Chilton said, and when they do it's often pessimistic \u2014 like their vote won't matter anyway.\n\nThat's why he's decided to vote after all \u2014 to fight that pessimism.\n\n\"We live in a great country. We've got choices,\" he said.\n\nPeer support workers from the shelter say they are planning to walk groups of people over to the polling stations on election day to help them cast their ballots.", "description": "Politics isn\u2019t usually the buzz at the soup kitchen at the Shepherds of Good Hope shelter, but a group of local organizations are trying to change that, in an effort to get more homeless people to the polls.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5318970.1570829867!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/shepherds-of-good-hope-voter-registration.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
