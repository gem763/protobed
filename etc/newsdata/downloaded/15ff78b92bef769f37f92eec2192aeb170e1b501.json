But at 74, the Blondie star is still irrepressibly creative, and happier than she\u2019s ever been\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until she was 31 \u2013 relatively old by pop-star standards \u2013 that Debbie Harry became famous. This goes some way to explain how she managed to cram in so much before she became the superstar frontwoman of Blondie. To name but a few of her experiences, as a child, she survived being in a coma as a result of pneumonia; as a young woman in New York, she worked for the BBC, hung out with Andy Warhol and other New York faces, escaped an abusive relationship, became a driver for the New York Dolls, started a girl band, formed Blondie and believes she had a lucky escape from the serial killer Ted Bundy. \u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have all my experiences on tap,\u201d Harry writes in her new autobiography, Face It.\n\nI meet her in a suite at the Savoy in London. She appears alone, wearing sunglasses. Harry is tiny (despite her platform trainers) and pale, with her instantly recognisable peroxide hair swept back. She looks as delicate and ethereal as a dandelion clock, but the sunglasses come off and her eyes are quick and determined. She seems warm and tries to ask me as many questions as I ask her \u2013 I can\u2019t decide if it is her enduring curiosity or a deflection technique. Perhaps it is both.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harry with David Bowie in 1980. Photograph: Nancy Kaye/AP\n\nShe remembers staying at the Savoy once with Chris Stein, her Blondie bandmate and then boyfriend, while Prince Charles and Diana were attending a party there. She recalls, with a laugh, that security came to interrogate them because of Stein\u2019s collection of ceremonial weapons.\n\nShe seems to have stories about everything, which makes Face It an often very funny read. Was it sometimes difficult looking back? Harry is 74, and has been through some traumatic events. \u201cSometimes, yeah. It wasn\u2019t something \u2026\u201d She pauses. \u201cI tend to move on, get interested in something and see what\u2019s about. I guess there were moments when I thought: \u2018God, you were such a fool.\u2019 You look back, and you think about all the mistakes you made: \u2018Why did I ever do that?\u2019\u201d She smiles. \u201cBut, all in all, I guess I\u2019ve been very lucky.\u201d\n\nHer biggest mistake, she says, was money. \u201cThat I didn\u2019t pay more attention to business, and that I was really only interested in making music and performing.\u201d\n\nIn the early 80s, Harry and Stein \u2013 they were in a relationship for 13 years \u2013 lost everything. Their debut album, the eponymous Blondie, came out in 1976, and for years they toured the world; they had six No 1 UK hits, including Heart of Glass and Call Me, and sold 40m records. When the US Internal Revenue Service hit them with a huge bill for unpaid tax, they lost their New York townhouse; the IRS even took some of her clothes, she writes. Worse, Stein was in hospital recovering from an autoimmune disease \u2013 Harry would spend the next few years looking after him \u2013 and they were not sure how they would pay his medical bills. It also meant the end of the band.\n\nAt the time, they were both on heroin. In her book, Harry, who would bring the drug to Stein in hospital, writes: \u201cI think that doctors and nurses knew that he was high all the time, but cast a blind eye because it kept him relatively pain-free and mentally less tortured.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harry with Andy Warhol in 1985. Photograph: Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nHarry had first tried heroin with an old boyfriend, but judging by old interviews it doesn\u2019t seem to have been a problem for her. How would she describe her relationship with it? \u201cI don\u2019t actually regret taking it, but I do regret the amount of time \u2026 it\u2019s a time-consumer. But I think at that point it was a necessary evil. To some degree, it was self-medicating. It was a rough, depressing time of life and it seemed to suit the purpose, but then it outlived its benefits.\u201d\n\nShe got off it, she says matter-of-factly, \u201cjust the way anybody does \u2013 go to a programme, or go into therapy. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d Her eyes widen and she changes tack. (She does this a lot.) \u201cNow, the whole opioid crisis [in the US] is even more serious,\u201d she says. Her aunt became addicted to painkillers. \u201cShe was a little bit older than I am today when she had this problem. It was hard for her to get off of all this.\u201d\n\nHarry, who was adopted as a baby, grew up in small-town New Jersey. She writes movingly about how a fear of abandonment has lasted all her life: \u201cI guess somewhere in my subconscious, a scene was playing on a loop of a parent leaving me somewhere and never coming back.\u201d\n\nWas it painful to revisit that in her book? \u201cNot at this point in my life because I\u2019m an adult. I think we all have a little area of clutter that\u2019s nagging sometimes and it\u2019s often hard to get rid of. Maybe this is my purge.\u201d Did it feel cathartic? \u201cWell, you know,\u201d she says with a sigh, \u201cI think I\u2019ve solved a lot of those problems that were hanging on and I\u2019m glad it\u2019s sort of done.\u201d\n\nShe spent a few years in New York after college, waitressing, failing at auditions and playing in bands. It wasn\u2019t working out, so she moved back to New Jersey and started a relationship with a man who was possessive and controlling; one night he broke into her flat, thinking she had another man there, put a gun to her head and threatened to rape her. \u201cThat was crazy, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d she says. She denies it had much of a lasting impact. \u201cI was just happy to get away from him and move on with my life. Fortunately, that\u2019s when I met Chris, so that was one of the best things in my life, if not the very best. We\u2019ve had a long run of great friendship and creative success so, my God, I can\u2019t ask for more.\u201d\n\nShe is similarly dismissive of another horrific incident. In the early 70s, when she and Stein were coming home after a gig, a man followed them and forced them at knifepoint to let him into their apartment. He was looking for drugs and equipment. He tied up Stein, then Harry. Once he had piled up the equipment he was going to take \u2013 guitars, Stein\u2019s camera \u2013 he raped her on the bed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harry and Stein in New York in 1978. Photograph: Roberta Bayley/Redferns\n\nIn her book, she writes: \u201cI can\u2019t say that I felt a lot of fear. In the end, the stolen guitars hurt me more than the rape.\u201d Can this be true? \u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, I was angry and I felt victimised. I wasn\u2019t beaten or harmed physically, it was all emotional or mental. Being raped \u2013 or fucked \u2013 by some stranger against my will at knifepoint, you know \u2026\u201d She pauses and sighs. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a happy moment in my life, but I really, seriously, empathise with women who are beaten. That would be something that [would lead to] emotional ramifications for the rest of my life. But this doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nShe knows it may seem hard to believe. \u201cIt is ludicrous,\u201d she says, \u201cand it is kind of funny that I would say it, but, truly, I wasn\u2019t physically molested. Afterwards, I was with Chris, and I was, you know \u2026\u201d She makes a sound to signal the horror she must have felt. \u201cI went on with my life. But as I say, I wasn\u2019t beaten or assaulted and I think that, coupled with being sexually violated, is truly awful. Then you are really made to feel powerless.\u201d But she was tied up at knifepoint. Didn\u2019t that make her feel powerless? \u201cYeah. Not the same. It wasn\u2019t for me anyway.\u201d She didn\u2019t have counselling, and says Stein was supportive \u201cand we moved on\u201d.\n\nPeople, me included, have found it hard to fathom her reaction. For this reason, she says: \u201cI\u2019m sort of wondering if I should have left it out [of the book], but it\u2019s part of the story.\u201d It feels wrong to push her on it too much. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it,\u201d she says, as she talks about whether it had any lasting impact. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to. I just said: \u2018I\u2019m not hurt, I\u2019m alive, I\u2019m doing what I want to do, I have a wonderful boyfriend\u2019 \u2013 and that was it. I had to consider what was important to me, and being a victim was really not who I wanted to be.\u201d Perhaps, I suggest, minimising it has helped protect her from it? She smiles. \u201cYeah. Absolutely.\u201d\n\nFew women have been objectified as much as Harry. Her face \u2013 those killer cheekbones and heart-shaped mouth \u2013 is immortalised on Blondie album covers and in Warhol\u2019s famous portrait. Was she always aware of men\u2019s reaction to her? \u201cI think we all have issues of self-esteem and I\u2019m not clear of that,\u201d she says, by way of an answer. \u201cI also think that because it\u2019s my occupation \u2013 to be a performer and to attract attention and to appeal to sexuality \u2013 it\u2019s sort of a given in showbiz.\u201d\n\nDid she feel objectified? \u201cThere was a time in the earlier Blondie years when I was trying hard to perform, sing and write, and all of those contributions would be overlooked [by critics]. And that was, well \u2026\u201d She doesn\u2019t finish the sentence. She was furious when Blondie\u2019s record label put out a poster with a picture of her wearing a see-through blouse. In the book, she writes: \u201cSex sells, that\u2019s what they say, and I\u2019m not stupid, I know that. But on my terms, not some executive\u2019s.\u201d\n\nDid she feel dismissed because of the way she looked? \u201cYes. A bit of fluff.\u201d Wasn\u2019t that infuriating? \u201cYes, but, you know, in a way it was good because I can sneak up on them unawares. I think times have changed in that respect. Women are serious wage-earners, and we create great things, and it seems clear to me that we can be supportive of one another regardless of what sex [we are].\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Blondie in 1976: (from left) Gary Valentine, Clem Burke, Harry, Chris Stein and Jimmy Destri. Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nI suspect the revelations from the #MeToo movement can\u2019t have come as any surprise \u2013 her book is full of incidences of being abused, stalked and generally mistreated by men \u2013 but she says incidences of harassment in her career were rare. \u201cI was working as a team and in a relationship. I wouldn\u2019t have felt comfortable being a solo artist and I\u2019m sure that those girls have a lot more to say about that than I do. I never went into meetings trying to get a record deal by myself, so it\u2019s a little bit different.\u201d The most important part of the #MeToo movement, she says, \u201cis that it makes men stop and think about their accepted behaviour\u201d.\n\nShe is pleased with how far women have come in the music industry, with more representation and power than before. \u201cIt\u2019s a radical change,\u201d she says. \u201cI always admire young women who are so gifted [at] writing and performing. It\u2019s wonderful and that\u2019s an inspiration for me, even though I\u2019ve gone over the hill, as it were.\u201d She laughs, mimicking clawing her way up. \u201cI\u2019m climbing up the other side.\u201d\n\nHow does she feel about getting older? \u201cIt sucks,\u201d she says with a laugh. But later, when I ask her when she was the happiest, she says: \u201cI\u2019m pretty happy now.\u201d\n\nThere was a time, just after 9/11, which she watched unfold from the window of her apartment, when she longed for the 70s. \u201cYou look back and everything looks a little bit rosier, but it was a good time. It was a good time to be a young person.\u201d And to be an artist because you could afford to live in pre-gentrified New York? \u201cAll of that,\u201d she says. \u201cEverybody in the 70s was living in squats and everything; it was kind of romantic.\u201d\n\nShe has outlived many of her friends and the New York characters who populate her book, such as David Bowie, Warhol and Joey Ramone. \u201cThere have been times when I\u2019ve had to face mortality and, as a person with strong survival instincts, I\u2019m blessed in that way,\u201d she says. Her numerous brushes with death include accepting a lift at about 2am in New York, from a man she believes was the serial killer Ted Bundy (people have said Bundy wasn\u2019t in New York at that time, but she is convinced it was him). \u201cI know that I\u2019m really lucky and the longer I live, the more I know it, so it has led me to do things that are not about myself,\u201d she says. She is \u201creally concerned\u201d about environmental issues and despises Trump: \u201cBeing stuck with the administration we\u2019ve got now, and the lack of decency, is appalling to me.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Andy Warhol\u2019s portrait of Debbie Harry. Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images\n\nHarry is a survivor. There isn\u2019t much she would have done differently, she says. \u201cWe all make mistakes, but the thing is to learn from them. And make different mistakes.\u201d\n\nIt is only recently, she says, that she has thought she might have liked to have had children (she is godmother to Stein\u2019s two daughters.) \u201cI sort of thought: \u2018Gee, maybe it wouldn\u2019t have been so bad to have kids.\u2019 But I don\u2019t know if I could have done it while I was working so much.\u201d Because she would have had to give up some of her freedoms? \u201cMy natural inclination is to really throw myself into things. It wouldn\u2019t be like I could hand over the baby. I would really want to be involved.\u201d\n\nShe is still working, writing and touring. She would quite like to do \u201ca real serious role in film or in TV, but that\u2019s sort of wishful thinking\u201d. There may be another solo album at some point, and another book.\n\nShe reaches into her bag and brings out two small notebooks \u2013 her \u201csnippet books\u201d, in which she writes ideas for songs, words and phrases. \u201cI\u2019m always coming up with ideas,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I\u2019ll be working, but I enjoy it \u2013 it\u2019s my life, and people still want to see me.\u201d She says, not for the first time: \u201cI\u2019m very lucky, and I think I know it more and more.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Face It, published by HarperCollins, is out on 1 October, price \u00a320.
