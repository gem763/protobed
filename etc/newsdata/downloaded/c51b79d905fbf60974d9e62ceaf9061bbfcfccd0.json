As they walk, they map blocked drains and piles of rubbish on their tablets. These are the \u201cinfection points\u201d that attract the rats and mosquitoes which, in turn, spread diseases like leptospirosis and the Zika virus, both prevalent here.\n\nStudent Alexandre Santos, 20, stops before a weigh-high tangle of wild plants overlooking a housing block. \u201cWe look at sewers, rubble, garbage. Now there is high vegetation,\u201d Santos says, tapping in the data. \u201cIt goes straight into the data bank.\u201d\n\nTourists flock to Salvador for its vibrant Afro-Brazilian culture and colonial architecture. But just 10km away, the health issues in its favelas are studied by doctors and researchers from international universities for the Urban Health Programme \u2013 an international project that recruits locals like Santos to research their own communities.\n\n\u201cPeople are impressed to find out about our work as we go through the neighbourhood or territory,\u201d says student Jonas Nascimento, 19, plotting infection points with Santos. \u201cThey can see we want to help.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018People can see we want to help,\u2019 says volunteer Jonas Nascimento.

Armed drug gangs operate here, their teenage lookouts scouting the neighbourhood for rivals and police for \u00a350 a week.\n\nIt is one of several neighbourhoods studied by the programme, which was set up in 2003 by academics and researchers from the Federal University of Bahia, Brazil\u2019s Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a government research institute, and the Yale School of Public Health in the US. It\u2019s funded by the National Institutes of Health in the US and Medical Research Council in the UK.\n\nIn Marechal Rondon, a young man leads a horse into a swamp covered in green vegetation into which raw sewage flows. Ricardo Lustosa, a postdoctoral researcher in public health at the Federal University of Bahia, who runs the programme in this community, warns him of the risk of catching leptospirosis if he has a cut in his bare feet. Lustosa gestures towards pieces of wood and broken plastic piled up beside a road. \u201cThis is the perfect place for mosquitoes and rats to reproduce,\u201d he says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Poor sanitation in favelas such as Marechal Rondon leads to the spread of disease. Photograph: Dom Phillips/The Guardian\n\nDeeper into the favela, three young men, one carrying a revolver, walk briskly down an alleyway beside a murky stream reeking with raw sewage. Adriana da Costa, 43, says it has often overflowed into the tiny house she shares with her children Eloa Sofia, nine months, Alana, 18, and Iago, 14, just a few metres away. \u201cI\u2019ve lost clothes. I\u2019ve lost a fridge. Bed, mattresses \u2013 my God,\u201d she says.\n\nLike many locals, she has a knee-high wall of bricks built across the door to keep the water out and has sealed the gap between the top of her walls and the roof to stop the rats jumping in. \u201cIt was full of rats. Rats on top of us,\u201d she says. \u201cI was scared for the children.\u201d Da Costa keeps her family with \u00a360 a month from the bolsa fam\u00edlia government cash transfer scheme and says she often misses meals.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Urban Health Programme research shows how leptospirosis cases are concentrated near an open sewer. Photograph: Ricardo Lustosa/Urban Health Programme and Nasa Worldview\n\nIn Marechal Rondon, 11% of the population has the leptospirosis bacteria. About 10% of people with the bacteria develop a severe form of disease causing multiple-organ dysfunction, which is fatal in 5-15% of cases. Salvador reported 113 suspected cases last year, of which 42 were later confirmed.\n\nOn a laptop, Elliott Rogers, a student from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, uses charts to show how leptospirosis and Zika cases are concentrated in low-lying areas of favelas. Later he will address an attentive circle of student volunteers before they head out to watch a demonstration on how a drone can help their work. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen research so connected to the community,\u201d he says.\n\nProgramme organisers hope young favela residents volunteering for the programme will also campaign for the structural changes needed to alleviate health problems.\n\n\u201cOur objective is to create activists and community leaders,\u201d says Lustosa.\n\nSantos says he would welcome such a role. As well as interning at the programme, he also founded his own tech start-up with Nascimento and other students. \u201cMany young people here have talents they can never show,\u201d he says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Adriana da Costa has lost count of the number of times sewage has overflowed into her tiny, two-room house. Photograph: Dom Phillips/The Guardian\n\nMiguel de Palma, 17, joined a drug gang after his parents separated. \u201cI got involved in this cruel world,\u201d he says. He started doing drug deliveries, moved up to dealing, and served time in juvenile prison. Then he heard about the Urban Health Programme and volunteered. \u201cThere was a person inside me I didn\u2019t know existed. I only found out when I came here,\u201d he says.\n\nWorking with local people has helped researchers study health issues in favela communities in detail. In the Pau da Lima favela, for example, research made possible by years of monitoring was valuable in understanding how people previously exposed to dengue fever may have been protected from the Zika virus.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The more you go down, the less money there is\u2019: Gielson do Sacramento, a field manager for the programme in Pau da Lima. Photograph: Dom Phillips/The Guardian\n\nResearchers also track inequalities within the favelas. On higher ground, streets are paved and houses solidly built. Down in the valleys these are replaced by shacks, muddy paths and open sewers. As a result, disease rates are higher.\n\n\u201cThe more you go down, the less money there is,\u201d says Gielson do Sacramento, a field manager for the programme in Pau de Lima favela, as he leads the way down a steep alley, greeting residents as he goes. Beside him is Albert Ko, professor of epidemiology and medicine and department chair at the Yale School of Public Health, who first began studying leptospirosis here in 1996.\n\nAt the bottom of the valley, they point out where a stream carrying raw sewage was finally piped underground a few months ago, following years of pressure from residents.\n\n\u201cWe worked with community associations and gave them data on leptospirosis and they gave it to government,\u201d says Ko, \u201cusing leptospirosis as a model of the neglect.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Albert Ko, from the Yale School of Public Health, works with communities to help them campaign for better sanitation. Photograph: Dom Phillips/The Guardian\n\nIn Pau da Lima, 15% of the population has tested positive for leptospirosis bacteria, including Alexsandro Santos, 42. He points to the muddy ground which the sewage now runs underneath. \u201cThey still need to pave it here,\u201d he says.\n\nA few dozen yards away, Vera de Oliveira, 40, says that since the sanitation has worked, raw sewage no longer floods the small house she shares with her youngest son Uanderson, 18. \u201cWe suffered a lot here,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are still rats.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Volunteers in Salvador\u2019s favelas are collecting data on deadly infections and inequality to help campaign for better sanitation", "authors": ["Dom Phillips"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/504036c30a0f3278e83e86a9a3188a01ccd678d1/0_62_2816_1690/master/2816.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=641ce78ab69db46eb326cc286ef2051b"}
