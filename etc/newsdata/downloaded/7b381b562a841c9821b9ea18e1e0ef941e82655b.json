Here's What They Did With The Cash.", "language": "en", "text": "Last month, while traveling through Iowa, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) stopped at a lemonade stand ran by two 11-year-olds, Sienna Michels and Audrey Billings. She bought seven cups of lemonade, which were $1 each, and let the girls keep the remaining $3 from the $10 she gave them.\n\nWarren tweeted about the stop:\n\nStopped for a quick drink at a lemonade stand in Harlan, Iowa. When life gives you lemons, make big structural change! pic.twitter.com/rp1PMyzwKX \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) August 8, 2019\n\nAs did a reporter from the Des Moines Register:\n\nJust happened to come across ?@ewarren? buying lemonade from some girls in Harlan. It was $7 \u2014 she gave them $10.\n\n\n\nThis is Iowa! pic.twitter.com/jdMFDSuAiv \u2014 Kim Norvell (@KimNorvellDMR) August 8, 2019\n\nFast forward six weeks later and the girls are now donating a portion of their money to a March for Life Education and Defense Fund, a pro-life organization. The reason? Because of Warren's stance on abortion, the Washington Free Beacon reported.\n\n\"Our daughters thought [Warren] was nice,\" Dan Michels, a Trump supporter and a father to one of the girls, told the Free Beacon. \"She came by and told us we should vote for her. And our daughters told us she was a nice person, but we don't align with her politically and \u2026 because she's pro-choice, we said we should donate her money to a pro-life [cause].\"\n\nAfter talking with his daughter about Warren's stances, particularly on abortion, they agreed to make the donation.\n\n\"My daughter told us she wanted us to vote for her,\" Michels recounted. \"We talked about the abortion part of things and said maybe we should donate money to stop abortion, and my daughter was all for that.\"\n\nAll-in-all, the girls raised $80 from 70 people. A few people, like Warren, donated extra to the two pre-teens.\n\nEarlier this summer, Warren announced her plan to protect abortion as part of a \"guarantee to protect reproductive health.\"\n\n\"Roe v. Wade established a woman\u2019s constitutional right to safe and legal abortion and has been the law of the land for over 46 years. These extremist Republican lawmakers know what the law is \u2014 but they don\u2019t care,\" Warrens proposal says. \"They want to turn back the clock, outlaw abortion, and deny women access to reproductive health care. And they are hoping the Supreme Court will back their radical play.\"", "description": "Hmm..09/23/2019 20:55:14PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Guy Benson", "Katie Pavlich", "Matt Vespa", "Reagan Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/248/bab1bd99-db67-496d-a3ec-fd074da0fdff.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
