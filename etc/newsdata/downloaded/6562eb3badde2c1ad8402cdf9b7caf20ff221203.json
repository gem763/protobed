(BAX) reported preliminary third-quarter results on Thursday in addition to disclosing that it may need to amend several years of financial statements.\n\nThe medical-products company reported global sales of about $2.85 billion for the quarter, slightly lower than the average analyst estimate on FactSet. Sales grew 3% compared with last year and 5% after adjustments, Baxter said.\n\nThe company also reported operating income of $503 million for the quarter. After adjustments, operating income totaled $555 million.\n\nShares of Baxter weakened in premarket trading after the company said it may need to restate results going back five years due to an accounting error connected to intra-company foreign exchange transactions.\n\nWrite to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 08:28 ET (12:28 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
