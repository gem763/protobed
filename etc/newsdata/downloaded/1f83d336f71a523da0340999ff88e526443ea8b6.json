It will also discontinue handgun sales in Alaska, marking its complete exit from handguns and allowing it to focus on hunting rifles and ammunition for those rifles only.\n\n\u201cWe have a long heritage as a company of serving responsible hunters and sportsmen and women, and we\u2019re going to continue doing so,\u201d according to a memo by Walmart\u2019s CEO Doug McMillon that will be circulated to employees Tuesday afternoon.\n\nWalmart is further requesting that customers refrain from openly carrying firearms at its stores unless they are law enforcement officers. Last month, a gunman entered a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, and killed 22 people using an AK-style firearm. Walmart already bans the sale of those firearms. Texas became an open carry state in 2016, allowing people to openly carry firearms in public.\n\nWalmart\u2019s latest move will reduce its market share of ammunition from about 20 percent to about 6 percent to 9 percent, according to the company memo. About half of its more than 4,000 U.S. stores sell firearms.\n\nThe nation\u2019s largest retailer has been facing increasing pressure to change its gun policies by gun control activists, employees and politicians after the El Paso shooting and a second unrelated shooting in Dayton, Ohio, in which nine people were killed. A few days before that, two Walmart workers were killed by another worker at a store in Southaven, Mississippi.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

But that fell well short of demands for the retailer to stop selling firearms entirely. Critics have also urged Walmart to stop supporting politicians backed by the National Rifle Association.\n\nThe retailer has long found itself in an awkward spot with its customers and gun enthusiasts. Many of its stores are located in rural areas where hunters depend on Walmart to get their equipment. Walmart is trying to walk a fine line by trying to embrace its hunting heritage while being a more responsible retailer.\n\nWith its new policy on open carry, McMillon noted in his memo that individuals have tried to make a statement by carrying weapons into its stores just to frighten workers and customers. But there are well-intentioned customers acting lawfully who have also inadvertently caused a store to be evacuated and local law enforcement to be called to respond.\n\nHe said Walmart will continue to treat \u201claw-abiding customers with respect\u201d and it will have a \u201cnon-confrontational approach.\u201d\n\nWalmart said it hopes to use its weight to help other retailers by sharing its best practices like software that it uses for background checks. And the company, which in 2015 stopped selling assault rifles like the AR-rifles used in several mass shootings, urged more debate on the reauthorization of the assault weapons ban. McMillon said Walmart will send letters to the White House and congressional leadership that calls for action on these \u201ccommon sense\u201d measures.\n\n\u201cIn a complex situation lacking a simple solution, we are trying to take constructive steps to reduce the risk that events like these will happen again,\u201d McMillon wrote in his memo. \u201cThe status quo is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nOver the past 15 years, Walmart had expanded beyond its hunting and fishing roots, carrying items like assault rifles in response to increasing demand. But particularly since 2015, often coinciding with major public mass shootings, the company has made moves to curb the sale of ammunition and guns.\n\nWalmart announced in February 2018 that it would no longer sell firearms and ammunition to people younger than 21 and also removed items resembling assault-style rifles from its website. Those moves were prompted by the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in which 17 people were killed.\n\nIn 2015, Walmart stopped selling semi-automatic weapons like the AR-15 style rifle, the type used in the Dayton shooting. The retailer also doesn\u2019t sell large-capacity magazines, handguns (except in Alaska) or bump stocks, nor the AK-style firearm that was used by the El Paso shooter.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Walmart stopped selling handguns except in Alaska.\n\n", "description": "The announcement comes just days after a mass shooting claimed seven lives in Odessa, Texas and two other back-to-back shootings last month.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d5/d3/ed954a4848a4bbe1b7dc23b41322/20190903-walmart-carts-gty-773.jpg"}
