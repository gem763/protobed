There was a lot. I was soaking wet \u2026 but I could see there was still a good amount of walnuts underneath the motor.'\n\nWith a task that overwhelming, the Persic's took their car to a nearby mechanic to finish the job.\n\nAmazingly, they found even more walnuts burrowed inside the vehicle.\n\n'They put it up on the lift and I guess there's a protective plate underneath,' Chris said, 'so when they took that off all the walnuts fell out all over the place.'\n\nThe mechanics reportedly found enough walnuts to fill half a trashcan.\n\nThe couple thinks the extreme amount of Walnuts were placed there by local rodents who were collecting a stash.\n\nLuckily, Holly's car didn't suffer extensive damage from the squirrel's nest.\n\nChris Persic (pictured): 'Here's a little PSA for everyone on this rainy Monday: Rodents and vehicles do not mix'\n\nBut a squirrel may have chewed through a fuel injector hose in Chris's new truck.\n\nSocial media users couldn't resist make a few puns about the funny situation.\n\nOne person said: 'Absolutely NUTS is right?'\n\nAnother said: 'Somebody will be going nuts looking for his walnuts.'\n\nThe post has attracted over 800 likes and nearly 900 shares.\n\n'Here's a little PSA for everyone on this rainy Monday: Rodents and vehicles do not mix,' Chris said in the post.\n\n'Long story short, if you park outside, do yourself a favor and check under the hood every once in awhile. My truck may have had a squirrel chew through/pull out a fuel injector hose, and Holly's looked like they were storing up for the next 3 winters.'\n\n'Was absolutely nuts...no pun intended.'", "description": "Chris and Holly Persic of Franklin Park, Pennsylvania got the surprise of their life when they discovered more than 200 walnuts stashed away in a squirrels nest inside the engine of their SUV", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/03/19521202-0-image-a-8_1570674056310.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
