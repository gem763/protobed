More needs to be done to achieve the ambitions of the Government's 25-year environment plan to reverse nature's decline so that our children can experience and benefit from a richer natural environment.'\n\nSophie Pavelle, a young conservationist who helped launch the report, said she had felt the loss of nature more acutely this year than any other, with 'a dawn chorus less deafening, hedgerows less frantic, bizarre, worrying weather'.\n\nEnvironment Secretary Theresa Villiers said the government valued UK ecosystem\n\n'People protect what they love, and if we can find quirky, empowering ways to encourage young people to connect with nature emotionally and see it as something they can truly champion, only then can we dig deep to find real hope for a brighter, sustained future for our natural world.'\n\nEnvironment Secretary Theresa Villiers said: 'We value our species and ecosystems in their own right, but they also contribute to our wellbeing and economic prosperity.'\n\nShe said the Government's 25-Year Environment Plan marks a step change in ambition for nature, and a new Environment Bill will contain 'ambitious measures to address the biggest environment priorities of our age, including restoring and enhancing nature for generations to come'.", "description": "Some of the country's most beloved and marveled at wildlife, such as the common harvest mouse, risks disappearing from their UK habitats, according to the State of Nature report.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/23/19274662-0-image-a-3_1570141667889.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
