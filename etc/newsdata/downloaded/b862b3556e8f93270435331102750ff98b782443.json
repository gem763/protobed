Shares Reena, \u201cI consciously chose to quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom but it made me little hateful towards my husband because I was left alone at home with the baby. I used to act out and I would call Dev when he was swamped with work and yell for no reason. Sometimes, he would return home hungry, I would choose that minute to argue. This affected our relationship.\u201d The two took steps to solve the issue, and have allotted talk-time. \u201cWe discuss the problem with each another over breakfast and sort it out in a calm and rational manner, which gives us mind space to reach a conclusion.\u201d While this may work for some, others should give their partner some time to cool off before they are ready to talk. Says Manjula MK, Chennai-based psychologist, \u201cDon\u2019t bring up arguments when your partner has a lot on his mind, and does not have the emotional bandwidth or time to focus and do justice to the argument. It will only make things worse. Either set aside time, or look for a moment when your partner is receptive to the idea of addressing issues.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nControl your emotions\n\nWhile it is tempting to have a go at your partner and let out the steam, don\u2019t let your emotions get the better of you. Advises Manjula MK, \u201cArguments are driven by negative emotions\u2014anger, dissatisfaction, conflict, sadness, and betrayal.\u201d Her advice is to focus on the reason behind the emotions rather than blow it up. \u201cIf you find that you\u2019re unable to let go, and that rage and emotion are clouding your thought process, it is better to take time out and compose yourself before continuing the argument.\u201d\n\n\n\nMind your words\n\nAn argument is never pleasant, and your partner and you are probably already hearing things that you don\u2019t want to. Says Chennai-based relationship counsellor Maria D\u2019 Mello, \u201cMeanness, contempt, and sarcasm are absolutely unwarranted in an argument, as they can compound the problem instead of resolving it. They serve no purpose other than allowing you to feel like you have the upper hand.\u201d She recommends keeping the conversation to the point, and also using words like \u2018I feel\u2019 or \u2018I believe\u2019 leading up to your opinions, so that your partner doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019ve already made up your mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet bygones be bygones\n\nIt\u2019s imperative that quarrels address only the issue at hand. Chennai based Kareena Patel*, a 32-year-old freelance photographer says, \u201cWhen my partner and I argue, we always sit and resolve matters without deviating from what\u2019s bothering us, or dredging up old issues that have been put to rest. I don\u2019t interrupt him or be dismissive of his viewpoint, and vice versa.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFind a middle ground\n\nArguments aren\u2019t about who\u2019s right or wrong, it is only a difference in perspective. Says Manjula MK, \u201cAn argument shouldn\u2019t be about one upmanship or winning. Instead, it should aim at finding a suitable resolution, enabling partners to sort out the differences, moving forward as a unit, and to make the relationship work. Most happy couples prefer to not lose sight, an choose to have a focussed, rational discussion instead.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits of constructive arguments\n\nConstructive arguments boost honesty, trust, communication and since negative feelings are out in the open, and discussed. Says D\u2019Mello, \u201cYou learn more about your partner, and they feel comfortable sharing their thoughts, and problems. You learn to see things from your partner\u2019s perspective, building empathy, and ultimately tend to feel closer to them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other side\n\nKeeping problems bottled up can be extremely toxic, as it leads to building feelings of resentment. If something is bothering you, it is best to address it in a logical way, and arrive at a solution. Also, if you don\u2019t address an issue, it may become repetitive, and you won\u2019t be able to nip it in the bud the minute it starts bothering you, and snowballs out of control. Says Manjula MK, \u201cPeople bottle up things for two reasons\u2013they\u2019re being childish and sulking, or they don\u2019t want their partner to see through the facade or persona they\u2019ve created. Both situations are unhealthy, and can lead to feelings of bitterness in both parties, which could build up over time and create lasting chasms in the relationship!\u201d", "description": "Not all disagreements have a negative impact on your bond with your partner.
