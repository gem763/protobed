A poll of 23 analysts compiled by Equinor forecast adjusted EBIT of $2.69 billion.\n\n\"We maintain strong cost and capital discipline, but our results are affected by lower commodity prices in the quarter. In addition, we have decided to use our flexibility to defer gas production to periods with higher expected prices,\" Equinor's Chief Executive Eldar Saetre said.\n\nNorway is Europe's second largest gas supplier after Russia, with Equinor accounting to the bulk of sales, which also includes volumes owned by the Norwegian state.\n\nEquinor's total equity oil and gas production was 1.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, down 8% from the same period in 2018.\n\nGas production off Norway alone fell by 17%, while average invoiced European gas prices were down 26%.\n\n\n\n\n\nCAUTIOUS ON SHALE\n\nEquinor had made impairment charges of $2.79 billion, with $2.24 billion related to its onshore shale oil and gas assets in North America on \"more cautious price assumptions\".\n\nThe impairments also included $206 million for repair costs and loss of revenue during repairs at its Bahamas oil terminal damaged by Hurricane Dorian in September.\n\nEquinor said earlier in October that is had managed to recover from the ground about a third of around 119,000 barrels of oil spilled when the hurricane ripped the roof of several tanks at its South Riding terminal.\n\nIn addition to the impairment, the results were impacted by the oil clean up and an onerous transportation contract costs of a total $537 million, of which the most significant part was provided for, Equinor said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(This story corrects to show costs were in addition to, not including, the impairment, paragraph 13)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Nerijus Adomaitis, editing by Terje Solsvik, Sherry Jacob-Phillips and Alexander Smith)", "description": "Equinor's  third-quarter profit fell by more than expected on Thursday after a significant decline in the volume and price of natural gas sold to Europe, although the Norwegian firm reiterated its forecast for flat 2019 production.
