This sweat leads to bacteria growth on the skin, socks, and shoes. The bacteria thrives in a damp, dark environment and ultimately produces the odor known medically as bromodosis.\n\nFeet have more sweat glands than any other part of the body and release sweat to keep the body cool throughout the day. While every individual is different, people who are on their feet all day, going through growth phases that increase hormones, or experiencing stress, as well as those who have certain medical conditions, tend to have sweatier feet. While everyone has bacteria on their skin and feet, those with more active sweat glands encounter more bacterial growth and odor. Poor hygiene and improper sock and shoe care can worsen the condition.\n\nThere are prescription treatments available that help control sweat production and treat infections caused by bacteria and fungi. But there are also simple steps and inexpensive products you can use at home to help keep odors under control.", "description": "Dealing with smelly feet can be a hassle.
