On several occasions, he has intimated that the Bidens have received millions of dollars from China, implying they capitalized on the then vice-president's political power and connections.\n\nDuring his remarks at the United Nations on Sept. 25 with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump said, \"When Biden's son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund, and the biggest funds in the world can't get money out of China, and he's there for one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two, I think that's a horrible thing. I think it's a horrible thing.\" Details on the deal that the President cited come from conservative author Peter Schweizer's newest book \"Secret Empires.\"\n\nA day later, in an exchange with reporters on Sept. 26, Trump implicated the elder Biden in his allegations, saying, \"But Adam Schiff doesn't talk about Joe Biden and his son walking away with millions of dollars from Ukraine and then millions of dollars from China. Walking away, in a quick meeting, walking away with millions of dollars.\"\n\nWe've already fact-checked the President's claims about the Bidens and Ukraine. Trump's newest allegations involving China are similarly misleading.\n\nThere is no evidence that former Vice President Joe Biden received money from China. Though when it comes to Biden's son Hunter, Trump's allegations are not thoroughly unfounded.", "description": "In attacking the Bidens, President Donald Trump has spent the majority of his time focusing on Ukraine, but he's also at times made vague allegations about the Bidens' ties to China.
