I went to Todd and asked, \u201cAre we playing this the way I think we\u2019re playing this?\u201d Todd responded with, \u201cWhat would be a compelling reason for the Joker to hate Batman so much?\u201d The idea that the Joker is an illegitimate child that didn\u2019t get anything from the Wayne family is a very compelling motivation for his character\u2019s hatred.\"\n\nHe also reveals that he played the character of Thomas Wayne as if he had had an affair with Penny Fleck.\n\n\"I asked Todd how Thomas Wayne would've know Arthur\u2019s mother,\" adds Cullen The backstory was that Arthur\u2019s mother had worked for Thomas in his home, and she was a beautiful woman who Thomas was attracted to and it led to a physical relationship. Later in life, she\u2019s in and out of mental institutions. And in my mind, Thomas Wayne put her there.\n\n\"What I like about the film is that it\u2019s about real people with real faults who make mistakes. Some are done out of protection, like moving Arthur and his mother out of the picture.\"\n\n(Image: WARNER BROS FILMS)\n\nVery intriguing!\n\nPerhaps this will be explored more if a sequel does end up happening - even if it seems unlikely right now.\n\nJoker is in cinemas now.\n\nDid you enjoy Joker?
