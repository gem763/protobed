Bill Maher, the boundary-pushing comedian, has branded the #MeToo movement \u201cscary\u201d and aspects of it \u201c#MeCarthyism\u201d whilst downplaying women\u2019s accounts of inappropriate touching at the hands of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, and the allegations against former congressman Al Franken.\n\nOn Friday night, Maher welcomed pal Tyson to his long-running HBO program Real Time. Tyson, who\u2019s managed to weather any professional ramifications from the sexual-misconduct allegations\u2014keeping his gigs with National Geographic\u2019s StarTalk, Fox\u2019s Cosmos and Hayden Planetarium\u2014joined Maher and his panel, which included The Daily Beast\u2019s politics editor Sam Stein, for an interview toward the end of the program. And sure enough, Maher joked about Tyson\u2019s planets tie; let him hawk his new book of published letters to and from his fans; debated the scientific evidence (or lack thereof) supporting the existence of God, as is the outspoken atheist\u2019s wont; talked flat-earthers; and acted generally chummy with one another.\n\nBill Maher Fails to Challenge The Federalist Publisher (and Mr. Meghan McCain) Ben Domenech\n\nJohn Oliver Thinks Rudy Giuliani Is Totally Screwed: \u2018Trump Will Abandon Him\u2019\n\nWhat Maher failed to do was even remotely probe the disturbing allegations against Tyson\u2014something that most interviewers of Tyson have failed to properly reckon with during his recent book tour (CBS This Morning sort of did, albeit via a soft line of questioning, asking what he\u2019s \u201clearned\u201d since the allegations surfaced.)\n\nIn addition to soft-pedaling the allegations against Biden, Maher voiced objections to the public outrage surrounding Dr. Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s sexual-assault allegation against Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee (now justice), Brett Kavanaugh. \u201cThere are social justice warriors who are crazy enough in this country, I fight with them all the time, who\u2026 they lend enough credence to this to make people think, \u2018Oh, you know what? They\u2019re going to go after my high school record. That\u2019s fair game now.\u2019 And it becomes sort of a privacy thing,\u201d offered Maher.\n\nLater on, the comedian added, \u201cIt does seem like things morphed from \u2018listen to any woman who says she\u2019s been wronged,\u2019 which is the right thing to do, to \u2018automatically believe.\u2019 That\u2019s what\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s frustrating about Maher\u2019s attitude toward #MeToo is that he appears to consistently downplay allegations of inappropriate touching or attempted sexual assault levied against certain men of power (usually Democrats), while regularly railing against those said to have been committed by President Trump, who\u2019s been accused of varying acts of sexual misconduct by over 22 women. While the attitude shouldn\u2019t be to \u201cautomatically believe\u201d women, it shouldn\u2019t take nearly two dozen accusers\u2014or hating the man\u2019s politics\u2014to either.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
