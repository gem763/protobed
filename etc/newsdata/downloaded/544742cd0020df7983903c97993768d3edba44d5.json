Schools and universities canceled classes.\n\nMany businesses closed, only accepted cash or had to guide customers with flashlights.\n\nA house in Paradise, California burns to the ground as a firefighter looks on during the Camp Fire in this November 8, 2018 file photo\n\nThe wildfires were believed to have been caused by PG&E's downed power lines.

This cannot happen again,' Johnson said.\n\nHe said he expected the precautionary outages would decrease in size and scope each year.\n\nTo reduce the need for them, the utility will create smaller sections of wires so that shutoffs can be more targeted, increase vegetation management and use new materials to cover power lines, Johnson said.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday urged the company to provide credits or rebates to affected customers.\n\nThe outage is the latest in a string of events for which PG&E has received widespread public criticism.\n\nThe utility filed for bankruptcy in January 2019, citing potential civil liabilities in excess of $30billion from major wildfires linked to its transmission wires and other equipment.", "description": "PG&E CEO Bill Johnson told a meeting with the California Public Utilities Commission in San Francisco that recent outages included lack of information and hardships that cannot be repeated.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/03/19909928-0-image-a-44_1571452726072.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
