The vulnerability reportedly affected all versions of Tendermint, on which Cosmos is built. All validators and service providers on Tendermint-powered networks are encouraged to update their software as soon as possible.\n\nBlockchain to blockchain communication\n\nThe Cosmos platform allows individual blockchains to communicate and transact with each other. Developed by the Tendermint team, it employs an inter-blockchain communication protocol to establish blockchain interoperability.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported in August, it is also one of the top staking projects in the crypto space today.\n\nRecent blockchain vulnerabilities\n\nThe Cosmos announcement caps a less than impressive week for blockchain security, with vulnerabilities also revealed in both ZCash and the Lightning Network.\n\nWhilst no further details of the Cosmos bug have been given, the vulnerability in Lightning Network was fully disclosed by a developer this week.\n\nLN nodes accepting funding transactions to open channels needed to check that the transaction was \u2018as promised\u2019, or an attacker could spend funds from the channel without paying.\n\nThe ZCash bug, announced Sept. 29, could have leaked metadata relating to the IP addresses of shielded full-nodes.", "description": "Blockchain interoperability platform Cosmos discloses a \u201chigh-severity security vulnerability\u201d in consensus engine Tendermint Core", "authors": ["Jack Martin"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNjRmZjVlMDY1NzcyZDkyYTRiNmM4Yjc5ZjU4Zjc0ZDkuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
