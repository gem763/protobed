In Sydney, 30 people have been arrested, including four protesters under the age of 16, The Guardian reports. Hundreds more were removed from a sit-in blocking a main road, according to the BBC. Another 100 protesters were arrested in Amsterdam. The actions are expected to continue across the US.\n\nMultiple #ExtinctionRebellion protestors have been arrested in the Sydney CBD pic.twitter.com/2SdTUMqzKL \u2014 Gus McCubbing (@GusMcCubbing) October 7, 2019\n\nThe actions were organized by Extinction Rebellion, a movement founded in the UK last year. The group rose to international prominence after nearly shutting down London with its demonstrations in April. The group says its strategy is to use nonviolent civil disobedience \u201cin an attempt to halt mass extinction and minimise the risk of social collapse\u201d due to climate change. That strategy included drenching the Treasury in Westminster with fake blood on October 3rd. On October 7th, protesters chained themselves to two cars blocking Westminster\u2019s Victoria Embankment. Video shows police cutting protesters free from the cars.\n\nExtinction Rebellion spray 1800 litres of fake blood outside the Treasury, which they say is failing to tackle climate change.\n\n\n\nBut a malfunction caused them to lose control of the hose which flailed across the road before it could be brought under control. pic.twitter.com/5duzoSWCNa \u2014 Channel 4 News (@Channel4News) October 3, 2019\n\nPolice are cutting two Extinction Rebellion protesters out of a car blocking off Victoria Embankment in #Westminster.\n\n\n\nThey\u2019re locked to a piece of concrete that\u2019s lodged in the vehicle.\n\n\n\nThe group\u2019s planning to take over 12 sites around Parliament for the next two weeks. pic.twitter.com/QanqTm4eNc \u2014 Helen Hoddinott (@helenhoddinott) October 7, 2019\n\nOrganizers expect today\u2019s London protests to draw five times as many people as the ones in April. Demonstrators occupying the Lambeth Bridge practiced yoga. While others were cuffed and taken away, onlookers documented the events on social media. Extinction Rebellion planned to protest in 12 sites around Westminster, each one representing a different cause like \u201cGlobal Food Justice\u201d and \u201cPeace.\u201d Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam, Madrid, and New York City were also major targets.\n\nProtestors from #ExtinctionRebellion now doing yoga on occupied Westminster Bridge. pic.twitter.com/dvYfCnlO8O \u2014 James Bickerton (@JBickertonUK) October 7, 2019\n\nCumulatively, since the Industrial Revolution, the United States has contributed the most planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and remains the second biggest polluter after China. \u201cIt\u2019s the Western countries, the European countries, North America that have got us into this mess,\u201d Jonathan Mintram, regional liaison coordinator with Extinction Rebellion in the UK, told The Verge. \u201cAnd so, personally speaking, I think we have a big responsibility to try and get us out of that.\u201d\n\n\u2018BLOODY\u2019 PROTEST: Aerial footage shows \u201cExtinction Rebellion\u201d climate change protesters demonstrating at the \u201cCharging Bull\u201d on Wall Street this morning, splattering the statue with red paint and with several playing dead; the NYPD reports 25 arrests. https://t.co/1qDL8vRwqi pic.twitter.com/IfyPmjio2K \u2014 World News Tonight (@ABCWorldNews) October 7, 2019\n\nIn New York City, protesters took aim at the famous Charging Bull statue near Wall Street, dousing it with fake blood. Police arrested the roughly 20 protesters covered in fake blood who staged a \u201cdie-in\u201d surrounding the bull as one woman stood atop it waving an Extinction Rebellion flag. More people were arrested in demonstrations on Wall Street and near the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nMaria and Ward Ogden traveled to New York City from their home in Vermont. \u201cWe\u2019re down in New York, specifically because we feel that we need to bring the protest to the areas where the power exists,\u201d Ward Ogden told The Verge. \u201cVermont is a beautiful rural state and I wouldn\u2019t leave it if I had a choice. But I don\u2019t have a choice. I\u2019m here to protest, where it\u2019ll be the most noticeable.\u201d", "description": "Arrests are underway as environmental protesters kicked off what they dubbed a \"global rebellion\" for the climate today.
