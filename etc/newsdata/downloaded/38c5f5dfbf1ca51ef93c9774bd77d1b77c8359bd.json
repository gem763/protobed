It's enough of the synthetic opioid to create four million lethal doses and has an estimated street value of more than $1.25 million. The Orange County Register reports the seizure last week yielded almost half the amount of fentanyl seized by authorities in the county during all of 2018 \u2014 a sign the drug is quickly growing into a substantial public threat.\n\nSheriff's officials say investigators served a search warrant and arrested Rudolph Garcia, 60, on multiple drug charges. It wasn't known if Garcia has an attorney.\n\nInvestigators also seized a semi-automatic handgun, heroin, methamphetamine and $71,000 in cash.\n\n#OCSDPIO The threat of fentanyl is increasing exponentially.
