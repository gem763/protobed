Mandatory Credit: Gregory J. Fisher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe leave, which can last up to seven days, is the first step while domestic violence allegations are investigated. An extension to the leave is possible after an initial investigation. Details of the alleged incident were not known.\n\nYankees manager Aaron Boone said Thursday that the MLB investigation will determine whether or not German is included on the postseason roster.\n\nGerman, 27, is 18-4 in 27 appearances (24 starts) with an .818 winning percentage that leads the majors. He has a 4.03 ERA and 153 strikeouts in 143 innings.\n\n\u2014Yankees reliever Dellin Betances, whose Achilles tendon injury on Sunday finished him for 2019, at least has reason to believe he won\u2019t need surgery to repair the partial tear after he received a second opinion on the injury.\n\nBetances, who was making his season debut in Toronto when he injured himself jumping on the mound after striking out the Blue Jays\u2019 Brandon Drury, spent the season\u2019s first five months recovering from shoulder and lat issues. He struck out both batters he faced on Sunday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be in a walking boot for another four weeks, and then they\u2019ll kind of re-evaluate where he is, but the belief is that he will not need surgery,\u201d Boone said. \u201cI guess that could possibly change, but they feel pretty confident that this is something that will not need surgery.\u201d\n\n\u2014First baseman Anthony Rizzo was back in the starting lineup for the Chicago Cubs and homered on Thursday, four days after leaving a game with a sprained ankle and subsequent reports that he could miss the end of the regular season.\n\nRizzo, who batted leadoff and went 1-for-3 in the Cubs\u2019 5-4, 10-inning loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. He is batting .289 with a .403 on-base percentage, a .521 slugging percentage, 27 home runs and 94 RBIs in 141 games.\n\nA three-time All-Star and two-time Gold Glove winner, Rizzo injured his ankle on Sunday while charging toward home plate to field a bunt. Earlier indications were that Rizzo would be in a walking boot for five to seven days before another evaluation.\n\n\u2014Baltimore Orioles left-hander Ty Blach was outrighted to Triple-A Norfolk, three days after he was designated for assignment and then cleared waivers.\n\nThe DFA on Blach allowed the Orioles to claim right-hander Eric Hanhold off waivers from the New York Mets.\n\nBlach, who was a waiver claim from the San Francisco Giants in August, went a combined 1-3 with a 12.00 ERA in seven appearances (five starts) for the Giants and Orioles this season.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Major League Baseball announced Thursday that New York Yankees right-hander Domingo German was placed on administrative leave under the joint domestic violence policy between the league and the MLB Players Association.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431851138&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J08L-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
