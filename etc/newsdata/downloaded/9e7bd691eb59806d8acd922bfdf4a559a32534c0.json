Speculation that Britain will avoid dropping out of the EU without a divorce accord lifted the pound last week to its biggest two-day gain in a decade, though both sides cautioned that much work remains to be done for Britain to leave by Johnson\u2019s October 31 deadline.\n\nAt issue are the prime minister\u2019s plans to take Northern Ireland out of Europe\u2019s customs union and give Stormont, its power-sharing assembly, a veto over the arrangement. The first would trigger the return of checks on goods crossing the frontier, something the Irish government and the EU oppose. The second would hand Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party an effective veto over the deal, something unacceptable south of the border.\n\nDUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds rejected any weakening of Northern Ireland\u2019s custom ties with the UK and said his party is awaiting the outcome of the talks in Brussels, Italy\u2019s La Repubblica newspaper quoted him as saying in an interview.\n\n'Our European friends'\n\nA possible compromise is a British idea for Northern Ireland to technically leave Europe\u2019s customs union but for the province to adhere to EU customs rules and tariffs, according to two officials. This would have the twin benefit of preventing a border on the island of Ireland and enabling the UK to strike trade deals around the world.\n\nIt\u2019s similar to a \u201ccustoms partnership\u201d plan the EU rejected in 2018, and would leave Northern Ireland with a different customs regime to the rest of the U.K. British authorities would have to collect tariffs on behalf of the bloc on goods crossing the Irish Sea. EU officials said the proposal is extremely complicated and needs work before it could be considered to be a solution, but didn\u2019t rule out that it could emerge as the compromise.\n\n\u201cGetting Brexit done by 31 October is absolutely crucial, and we are continuing to work on an exit deal so we can move on to negotiating a future relationship based on free trade and friendly cooperation with our European friends,\u201d Johnson said in a statement.\n\nEU officials view the only sure-fire solution as an arrangement that keeps Northern Ireland in the customs union, the so-called backstop. While there\u2019s no discussion yet of putting a time limit on that arrangement, something the EU has previously rejected, one EU official said that it could yet be considered.\n\nAny agreement would have to be backed by Parliament in London, where Johnson is reliant on the DUP. The party staunchly opposes subjecting Northern Ireland to different customs rules than the rest of the UK.\n\nAfter EU officials said Johnson indicated he was prepared to make sufficient concessions to allow detailed talks to begin, teams from both sides started work Saturday to explore whether they can arrive at the basis of an accord ahead of a summit of EU leaders that begins Thursday.\n\nIn a meeting with envoys of the bloc\u2019s remaining 27 countries on Friday, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, suggested that Johnson is softening his stance on both customs and Stormont\u2019s consent. In what would potentially be a significant climb-down, Johnson acknowledged there should be no customs border on the island of Ireland, two officials said. When asked in a pooled interview for British television, Johnson declined to say whether Northern Ireland will leave the EU\u2019s customs union.\n\nNot in 'full tunnel' yet\n\n\u201cThere is a joint feeling that there is a way forward, that we can see a pathway to a deal,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a done deal. There\u2019s work to be done.\u201d\n\nIn an article for the Sunday Telegraph, Jacob Rees-Mogg - whose hardcore anti-EU stance has peppered the airwaves since the 2016 referendum - suggested that some Brexiteers will have to come around to accepting Johnson\u2019s compromises.\n\n\u201cAs a Leaver, Boris can be trusted,\u201d Rees-Mogg wrote. \u201cIf he thinks the ship of state is worth an extra ha\u2019porth of tar, he deserves support.\u201d\n\nWhile negotiations are heading into a new intensive phase, they aren\u2019t headed into the full \u201ctunnel,\u201d the formal Brussels process by which the actual legal text of an agreement is thrashed out in secret.\n\nThis suggests that the EU still has reservations about the chances of getting a deal done, and that member states are unwilling to outsource the process entirely to Barnier and his team.\n\nThe European Commission will update the EU\u2019s national envoys Sunday, with the aim of having something concrete for EU affairs ministers to look at when they meet in Luxembourg on Tuesday to prepare for the summit.s\n\nPromising signals\n\nDUP Leader Arlene Foster fired a warning shot against trying to keep Northern Ireland in the EU customs union, though she stopped short of explicitly withholding support from the prime minister.\n\n\u201cThose who know anything about Northern Ireland will appreciate that these issues will only work with the support of the unionist as well as the nationalist community,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nFor all the optimism, there\u2019s still a long way to go.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said the UK hadn\u2019t yet \u201ccome forward with a workable, realistic proposal.\u201d\n\nBut there are \u201cpromising signals,\u201d he said.", "description": "The UK and European Union signalled a Brexit deal is in sight, with negotiators heading into intensive talks in Brussels as a potential compromise over the Irish border starts to emerge.", "authors": ["Ian Wishart"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4133/bd9548c8c146436e91edf45fe97615da.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
