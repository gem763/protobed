Neighborhoods and roads are flooded in parts of Connecticut.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Boston warned of \"very heavy rain\" and \"strong to perhaps damaging\" winds. The National Weather Service said there could be rough surf and flooding in the northeast U.S. and New England through Thursday.\n\nCBS News weather contributor Jeff Berardelli reported Thursday night that the storm had easily surpassed the threshold of bombogenesis, becoming a \"bomb cyclone,\" which is generally defined by a pressure drop of 24 millibars within 24 hours.\n\nWind gusts approaching 100 mph were recorded in Massachusetts. CBS Boston reports that the core of the strongest wind is now shifting across the Maine coast, as the rapidly intensifying storm moves northward. On the backside of this system, the wind has now shifted to the southwest and gusts will still range between 40-50 mph through the early evening.\n\nHurricane-Force Winds From Storm Topple Trees, Causing Extensive Damagehttps://t.co/JHX3kNcnhC \u2014 WBZ | CBS Boston News (@wbz) October 17, 2019\n\nMore than 400,000 customers in the Northeast are without power.
