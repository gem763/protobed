Yesterday I was more nervous, but today I was here to compete with the specialists. So I was much more relaxed.\"\n\nCarlos Edriel Yulo of the Philippines, who already made history in 2018 with his bronze medal on floor, became the Philippines' first world champion in any gymnastics discipline.\n\nXiao said that he noticed Yulo had made great progress in the recent years and his moves were always hard, but he was still surprised to see Yulo crowned.\n\n\"I thought Dolgopyat might be the best and I took him as the strongest competitor. Dolgopyat got a higher mark than me, which is predictable, and now I seem to have another top competitor,\" Xiao said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSilver medalist Israel's Artem Dolgopyat, left, gold medalist Philippines' Carlos Edriel Yulo, center, and bronze medlaist China's Xiao Ruoteng, right, shake hands during the medals ceremony in men's floor, October 12, 2019.
