Despite your best efforts \u2013 whether that\u2019s setting your Facebook account to \u2018private\u2019 or clearing your cookies every week \u2013 you actually only have to connect to the internet to forfeit anonymity.\n\nThis is largely because your identity is connected to your IP address \u2014 the numerical value given to any device you use to go online, tracking everything you do. It\u2019s a bit like a passport with unlimited pages, tying your activity to your name, email address, physical address, financial information, and more.\n\nWith increasing concerns over cyber security and user privacy, it\u2019s easy to see why this is a cause for concern, and many Brits are turning to virtual private networks to protect their identity.\n\nThese virtual private networks, or VPNs, not only prevent your IP address from exposing your identity but encrypt your personal data altogether.\n\nTo help you understand how VPNs are used and which service will offer the best VPN for your needs, read our handy guide:\n\nWhat is a VPN and what is it used for?\n\nWhen you sign up for a VPN, you sign up for increased cyber security. Virtual Private Networks (or VPNs) encrypt your data and mask your identity as you surf the web, providing a strong and simple privacy solution for those who don\u2019t want to be tracked by websites or service providers.", "description": "The internet probably knows more about you than you think.", "authors": ["Lela London", "Robin Pagnamenta", "Harry De Quetteville"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/10/14/best-vpns-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqnntzVh6i2V8vnWmVeYqabhk1mDTumCeH_NeArSD702I.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
