However, now there is definitive proof for the argument that girls do indeed run the world, as the great prophet Beyonce says. Per a 17-year-long study by S&P Global Market Intelligence, female CEOs and CFOs made their companies a whopping $1.8 trillion more than their male predecessors. This despite the fact that they led companies during the 2008 Global Recession as well!\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what the study revealed\n\nCalled When Women Lead, Firms Win, this study was done to examine the performance of companies which appointed female CEOs and CFOs as a part of an initiative called #ChangePays. It studied the benefits of having women in the workplace from 2002 to 2019.\n\nAmong the many things it found, the most noteworthy was the importance of female leadership and the difference it makes. These women, who took over from men, improved their companies\u2019 stock performance by an average of 20% compared to the men before them. This change was seen just 24 months after these women took on their roles.\n\nAdditionally, their presence also made the workplace more diverse in terms of gender, because companies with female leaders also had twice the number of women in their board of directors than the market average. The best part? Such firms were more profitable overall than firms with low diversity.\n\nThe sad part is that out of the 5,000-odd male leaders appointed during this time, only 500 were women. Imagine the difference if more women were appointed!\n\nWhy this study matters\n\nThe bleak truth is that the acceptance of women in positions of power is still a distant dream. Not only are women denied equal opportunities from the get-go, but numerous setbacks due to their gender and the bias against it holds women back. So, a study which gives proper evidence in support of supporting women is a good way to shut down naysayers and promote female leadership.\n\nHowever, equality shouldn\u2019t have to come from a place of utilitarianism\n\nThere is a small problem with promoting women because \u201cit pays.\u201d For those who refuse to see the moral imperative behind egalitarianism, such a utilitarian angle citing how profitable it is to have equal representation at the workplace might work, and this study is something like that. However, we shouldn\u2019t have to be making more money for a company than men to deserve a place at the table.\n\nWhy shouldn\u2019t women be given equal opportunities regardless of this? Why should we have to generate more money to be deserving of something men are handed on a silver platter? We shouldn\u2019t have to bend over backwards to get the chances men are freely given regardless of their merit. Equality should exist in any developed and morally-upright society without it having to be financially profitable.", "description": "According to a study by S&P Global Market Intelligence called #ChangePays, female CEOs and CFOs made 1.8 trillion dollars more in profits than their male predecessors, proving that women leaders actually make firms more money!", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://im.idiva.com/content/2019/Oct/iDiva_Indra_Nooyi_Roshni_Nadar_Social_5dad62f055246.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
