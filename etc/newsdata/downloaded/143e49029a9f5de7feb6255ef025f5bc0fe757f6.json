Trainer Phil D\u2019Amato\u2019s training and medication records need to be investigated and released to the public and the horses still in his barn should be thoroughly examined,\u201d animal rights group PETA said in a statement.\n\n\u201cD\u2019Amato also trained Satchel Paige, who died on October 19, and Formal Dude, who died on June 8.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Amato did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSanta Anita Park has been under scrutiny over its alarmingly high fatality rate.\n\nRacing at the track was canceled for more than three weeks in March following a series of fatalities.\n\nSanta Anita hired a consultant to lead a study of the track surface and the California Horse Racing Board also investigated, but the cause of the spike in fatalities remains unknown.\n\nFederal legislation has been introduced aimed at curbing the use of race-day medications in the sport.\n\nSome $22 million in prize money will be up for grabs at the two-day Breeders\u2019 Cup meeting on Nov. 1-2.
