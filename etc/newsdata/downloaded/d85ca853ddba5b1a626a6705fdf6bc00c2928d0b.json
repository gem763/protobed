Harvey Keitel shows up, as does Welker White, who was Henry Hill\u2019s babysitter in \u201cGoodfellas\u201d and is Jo Hoffa, Jimmy\u2019s wife, here. Pesci, who has been mostly absent from movies for the past 20 years, is the revelation. He\u2019s lost the strut and the shtick that used to define (and sometimes undermine) his performances, and does everything with his sad, watchful eyes and his lovely, walnut-shell face. When he and De Niro are onscreen together, you believe in the power of art.\n\nBut \u201cThe Irishman\u201d isn\u2019t sentimental about that, either. It\u2019s a gift for cinephiles, to be sure \u2014 it will arrive in theaters on Nov. 1, on Netflix Nov. 27 \u2014 but also a somber acknowledgment of limitations. Alongside the story of Frank\u2019s career runs another one, nearly invisible to him, about the price paid by the women in his life, in particular his daughter Peggy. Peggy (played as a child by Lucy Gallina and then by Anna Paquin), is fond of Hoffa and creeped out by Russell. Though she barely says a word, her silence delivers a damning verdict on her father and his world. It also represents a gesture on Scorsese\u2019s part toward some of the stories he hasn\u2019t chosen or known how to tell over the years. That\u2019s another kind of loss.\n\nTo watch this movie, especially in its long, graceful final movement, is to feel a circle closing. This isn\u2019t the last film Scorsese will make, or the last film anyone will make about the Mafia in its heyday, but it does arrive at a kind of resting place. Not an easy one, by any means, since what \u201cThe Irishman\u201d looks back on is a legacy of violence and waste, of men too hard and mean to be mourned. A monument is a complicated thing. This one is big and solid \u2014 and also surprisingly, surpassingly delicate.\n\nThe Irishman\n\nRated R. Everybody dies. Running time: 3 hours 30 minutes.", "description": "Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci star in Martin Scorsese\u2019s monumental, elegiac tale of violence, betrayal, memory and loss.
