We welcome you all with open arms.\u2019\n\nThe new restaurant is set to open on November 1 in Castle Cary, Somerset.\n\nWhat tube lines are affected by the Extinction Rebellion?\n\nDespite the negative start, Mr Bennett says he aims to have \u2018two AA Rosettes minimum\u2019 in five years time and possibly a Michelin star in the future.\n\nThe budding restaurateur has worked in a number of one and two Michelin starred establishments and has been employed as a private chef for several professional footballers.\n\nHe said: \u2018In five years\u2019 time, I would like two AA Rosettes minimum and would like to be known as the best eatery in the area.\n\n\u2018I think that\u2019s realistic, I think we can do it and I\u2019d like it to happen.\n\n\u2018A Michelin star would be nice, but baby steps. We\u2019ll tackle the rosettes first and then if we can we\u2019ll go as high as we can.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
