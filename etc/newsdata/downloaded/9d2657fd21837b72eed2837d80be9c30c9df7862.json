And every year, on the second Monday of October, a growing number of Americans use the holiday to honor indigenous people instead.\n\nSome in Congress say it\u2019s time for federal government to do this, too.\n\nA bipartisan group of House lawmakers introduced a resolution on Friday calling for designating the second Monday in October as \u201cIndigenous Peoples\u2019 Day,\u201d which would give Americans a chance to celebrate indigenous peoples and their shared history and cultural contributions.\n\nHere\u2019s a copy of the resolution, which is co-sponsored by Reps. Norma Torres (D-Calif.), Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), Don Young (R-Alaska), Sharice Davids (D-Kansas) and Betty McCollum (D-Minn.).\n\nHaaland, one of the first-ever Native American women in Congress, said the resolution is important because it\u2019s about correcting history.\n\n\u201cSome people are like, \u2018They\u2019re trying to erase history, blah blah blah.\u2019 It\u2019s not that,\u201d Haaland told HuffPost. \u201cColumbus Day is, to me, kind of a misnomer because really, indigenous people and the genocide they experienced and the displacement, the brutality that Columbus brought with him when he set the stage for a European presence on this continent \u2015 we should be celebrating the resilience and the survival of indigenous people on this continent.\u201d\n\nColumbus wasn\u2019t exactly the hero we all learned about in elementary school. He enslaved Native Americans. He ordered a brutal crackdown in which many Native people were killed, and he ordered their dismembered bodies to be paraded through the streets. He helped introduce new diseases to the continent that devastated Native populations.\n\n\u201cOh my god, he was horrible,\u201d Haaland said. \u201cHe killed people. He brought disease. You\u2019ve heard about the smallpox blankets and all the future eras that would happen within our U.S. government and our country. I\u2019m surprised that so many of us survived that. We need to start learning about the true history of our country, not the fiction that started with Columbus being some force for good.\u201d\n\nA growing number of cities and states already celebrate the second Monday in October as Indigenous People\u2019s Day. In the past year, at least five states and numerous cities and towns joined the list of municipalities officially recognizing it.\n\nBecause the congressional resolution is considered a commemorative resolution, it won\u2019t get a vote on the House floor. For now, it is just a step toward getting Congress to pass binding legislation.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\n5 Young Native Americans On What Indigenous Peoples Day Means To Them\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro Introduces Major Platform For Indigenous Peoples\n\nHere Are The States Celebrating Indigenous Peoples Day Instead Of Columbus\n\nLove HuffPost?
