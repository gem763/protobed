This time around, the conservative provocateur straight-up dismissed the notion that white nationalism is a problem.\n\nEarly on in Friday\u2019s hearing before the House Oversight Joint Subcommittee, Owens\u2014who late last year said Adolf Hitler was \u201cOK\u201d before he tried to go global\u2014downplayed the threat of white supremacy in the United States, calling it nothing more than a fringe issue. (Reminder: The El Paso mass shooting was less than two months ago.)\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to have a hearing on white supremacy, we are assuming that the biggest victims of that are minority Americans,\u201d Owens stated. \u201cAnd presumably this hearing would be to stop that and preserve the lives of minority Americans. Which based on the hierarchy of what\u2019s impacting minority Americans, if I had to make a list of 100 things, white nationalism would not make the list.\u201d\n\nOwens, meanwhile, went on to tally off a number of culture war issues that she felt were much more urgent for African-Americans, such as black-on-black crime, abortion, and the left\u2019s so-called war against men and masculinity.\n\nLater on in the hearing, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH)\u2014who was a late arrival\u2014ceded all of his time to Owens, who had largely been ignored by Democrats throughout the bulk of the proceedings. (Owens was invited to testify at the hearing by Jordan himself.) The former Turning Point USA communications director claimed she was being passed over because she was speaking truth to power that the issues of racism and white supremacy were overblown and being used for political purposes by Democrats.\n\n\u201cI also found it quite hilarious that when asked for actual numbers, nobody here could actually provide them because it\u2019s not actually a problem in America or a major problem that\u2019s facing black America,\u201d she declared.\n\n\u201cWhite supremacy and white nationalism is not a problem that is harming black America,\u201d Owens added before calling on the African-American community to start \u201cputting fathers back in the home\u201d and demanding a return to \u201cGod, religion and shrinking government.\u201d\n\nReacting to Owens\u2019 remarks, fellow panelist Dr. Kathleen Belew\u2014a professor and historian who has researched the rise of the white power movement\u2014took Owens to task for laughing off the current research into white nationalism.\n\n\u201cI object strenuously to your use of the word hilarious,\u201d Belew noted. \u201cTo me, this feels a lot like your reaction to being named in one of these manifestos. Now, you\u2019re of course not responsible for the words of someone writing that document, but I do think laughing at it is a real problem.\u201d\n\nOwens, after being named as an influence in the Christchurch shooter\u2019s manifesto, reacted by tweeting out \u201cLOL,\u201d sparking criticism that she was being insensitive in the wake of a mass shooting that left dozens of Muslims dead.\n\nThe conservative commentator insisting that white nationalism isn\u2019t a real problem in America echoes Fox News host Tucker Carlson\u2019s infamous assertion last month that white supremacy is \u201ca hoax,\u201d a claim the right-wing star made just days after a suspected mass shooter deliberately targeted Mexicans.\n\nFurthermore, in a Fox News appearance in June, Owens said that African-Americans were better off under Jim Crow laws and before the passage of the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act.", "description": "\u201cBased on the hierarchy of what\u2019s impacting minority Americans, if I had to make a list of 100 things, white nationalism would not make the list,\u201d Owens declared on Friday.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_344,w_611,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569001818/candace_ppntrw", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
