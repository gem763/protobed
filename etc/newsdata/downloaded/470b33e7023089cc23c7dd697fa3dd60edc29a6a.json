The question is whether there can be a mini-deal that comes out of it. Certainly nothing comprehensive,\" said Sherry Madera, a former Minister-Counsellor at the British Embassy in Beijing.\n\nFormer Deputy Assistant US Trade Representative Matt Gold said that if the talks went well, China might make additional agricultural purchases and the US might push back its planned tariff hike.\n\nBut he said neither Chinese President Xi Jinping nor US President Donald Trump seem to think ending their trade dispute is urgent.\n\nFor Mr Trump, it is an issue he can use in the upcoming Presidential election, while for Mr Xi, it's a waiting game, Mr Gold said.\n\n\"He wants to see Donald Trump fail and he's willing to dig in his heels to make it happen.\"", "description": "Without progress at the talks, the US will increase tariffs on $250bn worth of Chinese goods.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B44D/production/_109175164_6gllj7d2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
