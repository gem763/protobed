The problem was that Apple didn\u2019t make it clear that it had any actual humans listening in, much less random contractors who didn\u2019t even formally work at Apple itself.\n\nIn response, Apple issued an apology and suspended the program. It also changed its policies so that Siri recordings wouldn\u2019t be kept by default, and developed a new opt-in program for users who specifically want to give their recordings over to Apple to help improve Siri. It\u2019s that new program that\u2019s rolling out with the latest iOS 13.2 beta.\n\nAs promised earlier this year\n\nAdditionally, Apple promises that only Apple employees will be reviewing the audio clips, not contractors, although both contractors and employees will still be able to review text-only computer-generated transcripts from Siri.\n\nFurthermore, Apple is adding a new \u201cDelete Siri and Dictation History\u201d trigger, where users will be able to manually have Apple delete all data from past Siri requests. Data deleted within 24 hours of a Siri request won\u2019t be included in the grading program for users that did opt in, giving those users the option to prevent specific requests from being overheard.\n\nWith iOS 13.2 still in beta, it\u2019s possible that these features might be delayed until a later public release, but barring a sudden delay, it seems like it\u2019ll only be a short while before the new Siri opt-in feature is available for all iOS users.", "description": "Apple\u2019s promised Siri recording opt-in feature is starting to roll out with the latest beta for the upcoming iOS 13.2 update, allowing customers to decide if they\u2019d like to give audio recordings of requests to Apple to improve Siri.", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hKP3M7j1gHud50NYFbeFwL7yHeQ=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9438395/akrales_171006_1743_0129.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
