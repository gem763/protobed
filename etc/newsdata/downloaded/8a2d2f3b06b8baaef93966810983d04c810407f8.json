We'll plan it out and we've identified four or five who might be going out in January. Obviously, our first-team manager has a say.\n\n'Three lads could have possibly gone on loan \u2013 Angel Gomes, Tahith Chong and James Garner \u2013 but he wanted to keep them here and have a look at them on tour. So a decision will be made, no doubt, for January as well. Hopefully, all three will be in the first team and not going anywhere.\n\n'As we know at this club, lads have got into the first team and a lot of it has been through circumstances they've got no control over. They've been presented with an opportunity and they've taken the opportunity so now a couple of them are regulars on the teamsheet each week. We've had opportunities that have cropped up from nowhere. That's football.\n\n'Hopefully, some of the lads out on loan now will also catch the eye as some have gone out with a perception of their ability and where they'll end up but hopefully they'll come back and people will say maybe we've got a little diamond.'\n\nGomes, Chong and Garner have all played for the first-team but their route to becoming a regular is blocked by a number of more experienced, international-calibre players.\n\nJames Garner could also leave, with his path to first team currently blocked by other players", "description": "Despite Gomes, Chong and Garner all having enjoyed time in the senior set-up though, the club are considering sending them out on short-term loans to continue their progress to the first team.", "authors": ["Ben Nagle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/13/19739440-0-image-a-69_1571141985781.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
