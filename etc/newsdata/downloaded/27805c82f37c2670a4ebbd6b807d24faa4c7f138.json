The outcry has been overwhelming and has come from all sides.\n\nThe bank has been condemned by politicians from each of the main parties, including Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom, who told it to reconsider. So far, it is stubbornly refusing to do any such thing.\n\nScores of customers have contacted this newspaper or gone online to express their disgust and to say they will be moving their accounts.\n\n'The tin ear Barclays has shown in the Post Office affair makes you wonder how much it really cares about customers,' says Ruth Sunderland\n\nThis row has erupted at a time when memories of the financial crisis, and Barclays' behaviour during that era, have been rekindled. It coincides with the start of the trial of three former bosses for alleged fraud, when the bank raised billions of pounds from Qatari investors in 2008 in order to avoid a Government bailout.\n\nThe financial crisis exposed a culture of contempt that was rife at Barclays, both for the regulators and for its ordinary customers. Under former boss Bob Diamond, the interests of the 'casino' investment bank, a bonus-machine for those who worked there, were held paramount.\n\nThose bad old days are supposed to be over. But the tin ear Barclays has shown in the Post Office affair makes you wonder how much it really cares about customers.\n\nLike the other banks, it has been shutting branches, closing about a third of its network in the past five years, according to Which? The number of free-to-use cashpoint machines is also shrinking at an alarming rate, as customers are encouraged into online banking.\n\nThat may be fine for the young, the tech savvy and for urbanites \u2013 so long as they do not fall victim to online fraudsters \u2013 but not so much for vulnerable customers, who are often elderly and living in rural areas.\n\nThe bank has been condemned by politicians from each of the main parties, including Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom\n\nTwo years ago, to help protect those groups, 28 banks \u2013 including Barclays \u2013 signed up to an arrangement with the Post Office, allowing customers to withdraw cash, pay money in, deposit cheques and check balances.\n\nThis isn't a niche activity, by the way: the Post Office last year handled more than 130million banking transactions.\n\nBarclays denies it is trying to cut costs, and claims it has better ideas for making sure customers have access to cash.\n\nThese consist of a promise not to close down the last bank in town for the next two years \u2013 which is hardly a long-term solution \u2013 plus a new scheme to let people withdraw cash from local businesses. Initially, these will be 200 firms, most of which are customers of Barclays and have a Barclaycard terminal. The bank declined to say whether it expected to profit as a result, saying this information is 'commercially sensitive'.\n\nRegardless of whether it makes money, Barclays has driven a coach and horses straight through an arrangement that was simple and served customers well.\n\nThe bank's decision could also encourage others to follow suit, leading to the breakdown of the whole system. That would be a terrible shame, not only for customers but also for post offices, which are a vital part of the community. But many are struggling financially, and if they lose banking transactions it will weaken them further.\n\nJes Staley, Barclays chief executive, is a busy man. He has this year fought off an activist investor trying to make him shrink its investment bank. He has to deal with Brexit, remaining PPI problems and a host of other issues. But he should make the time to intervene personally and reverse this dreadful decision.\n\nIt has made his bank look socially irresponsible and heartless.", "description": "Barclays' decision to ban its customers from withdrawing cash from post offices has been a spectacular own goal.", "authors": ["Ruth Sunderland For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
