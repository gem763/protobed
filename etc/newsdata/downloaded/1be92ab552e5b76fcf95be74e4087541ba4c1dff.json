They are also components for wind turbines, electric vehicles, power tools and fridges.\n\nThe bilateral discussions build on talks between President Trump and Prime Minister Scott Morrison in Washington.\n\nAs well as seeking development capital from the US and other foreign allies, the Morrison government is exploring whether to deploy funds to early-stage projects from the export credit agency Export Finance Australia and the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility.\n\nArafura Resources seeks backing\n\nArafura Resources managing director Gavin Lockyer said he had pressed the Morrison government for Australia and the US to provide concessional government loans to help fund its planned $1.1 billion rare earths project located near Alice Springs.\n\n\"Most of these critical minerals projects require major capital but are being developed by small to medium sized miners,\" Mr Lockyer said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Governments can become an enabler by recognising it as a strategic project to send a confidence signal to private equity and debt investors.\"\n\nA US Studies Centre report on rare earths by David Uren questions whether the government should use taxpayer money to develop rare earths.\n\n\"Australia has at least half a dozen rare earth projects ready for development but needing commitments from potential customers and financiers,\" Mr Uren noted.\n\n\"However, it would have to go into any such commitment with its eyes open to the possibility of losses to the taxpayer \u2013 rare earths have often been in oversupply with poor prices.\"\n\nASX-listed Lynas, the biggest supplier of rare earths outside China, is edging closer to making a call on building a first-stage processing plant next door to BHP\u2019s Nickel West operations outside Kalgoorlie in Western Australia.\n\nArafura's Neodymium-Praseodymium rich deposit is targeting non-Chinese export markets and the company has held talks with the US Defence Department, according to the US Studies Centre report. Chinese investors also have a minority stake in the firm and it has a non-binding offtake agreement with a Chinese permanent magnet maker.\n\nArafura's Mr Lockyer said the project was going well since raising more than $20 million in July to progress engineering work, after earlier passing a feasibility study and environmental approvals.\n\nIf project finance is forthcoming, he said soil could be turned by late 2020 and producing by around 2023.\n\nMr Morrison said on Wednesday Australia was co-operating on international supply chains for critical minerals and rare earths with countries including the US, Japan, India and the Netherlands.\n\nMr Morrison will meet Mr Ross this week on his visit to Canberra and Sydney.", "description": "President Donald Trump's commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has discussed mining projects critical to national security with Australia's resources minister.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2659%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_8/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/329592cb067b2e00479124c1e6a8c969966c492a", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
