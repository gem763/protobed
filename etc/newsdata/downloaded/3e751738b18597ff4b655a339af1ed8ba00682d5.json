Milwaukee was undone by wildness from closer Josh Hader and an error by Grisham in right field that allowed the go-ahead run to score with two outs in the bottom of the eighth inning.\n\nIt added up to a gut-punch of a 4-3, season-ending loss to the Washington Nationals in the NL wild-card game Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to sting. It\u2019s going to sting for a long time. Essentially gifting the Nationals a Divisional (Series) berth,\u201d Grisham said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt. I expect it to hurt.\u201d\n\nHe is a 22-year-old rookie who debuted Aug. 1 and played in only 51 major league games this season, taking over in right primarily after 2018 NL MVP Christian Yelich went down for the year after fracturing his right kneecap on Sept. 10.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be magnified because of the big stage, but he\u2019s a huge reason that we\u2019re even playing in this game. He has a lot to be proud of in his first taste of the big leagues,\u201d Yelich said. \u201cI feel for him. If you play baseball long enough, you\u2019re going to be in these situations. You\u2019re going to come up short sometimes. It\u2019s part of being a professional athlete. He\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d\n\nEven without Yelich, Milwaukee managed to surge into the playoffs, winning 18 of 20 games during one stretch and relying on a strong bullpen.\n\nThat formula appeared set to work again Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIf you could have told me we\u2019d hand the ball with six outs to go (to) Josh,\u201d Counsell said, \u201cthat would have fit our script really, really well. It just didn\u2019t play.\u201d\n\nMilwaukee went to the bottom of the eighth leading 3-1, thanks to homers by Yasmani Grandal and Eric Thames. Starting pitcher Brandon Woodruff tossed four innings, Brent Suter threw one and Drew Pomeranz two.\n\nThen it was time for Hader, a hard-throwing All-Star lefty who saved 37 games this year. He loaded the bases with two outs, hitting one batter with a pitch, walking another and allowing a broken-bat bloop single.\n\nThat brought up Juan Soto, the Nationals\u2019 20-year-old cleanup hitter, who smacked a 96 mph fastball into right. Two runs scored easily on the play - and that would have been it had Grisham fielded the ball cleanly. But he missed it, letting it skip under his glove and past him.\n\nThat miscue let the go-ahead run score.\n\n\u201cCame in a little off balance,\u201d Grisham said. \u201cKind of took a little funky hop on me.\u201d\n\nSoon thereafter, a Brewers team that made it all the way to Game 7 of the NL Championship Series a year ago was done.\n\nLike so many of their teammates, Hader tried to let Grisham off the hook.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not anything on him,\u201d Hader said. \u201cIt comes down to me making my pitches.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP freelancer Bobby Bancroft contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Trent Grisham's eyes were still red, his cheeks stained by tears, as a group of Milwaukee Brewers teammates gathered near his locker in the visitors' clubhouse at Nationals Park to offer hugs and words of encouragement.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Howard Fendrich"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/02/brewers_nationals_baseball_62280_c0-185-4422-2763_s1770x1032.jpg?dcde3943ec23fe069c12b6dac24c188cd0d06d0f"}
