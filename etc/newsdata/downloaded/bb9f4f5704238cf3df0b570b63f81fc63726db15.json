And it\u2019s even harder when you\u2019re a single mom trying to keep your chrome dome stubble-free and your daw-dah alive. Granted, it\u2019s also true that, in Alpha\u2019s case, she\u2019s solo parenting because she murdered her husband. But he was a little too touchy-feely for the harsh realities of the new world. And Alpha likes her men mumbly, tall, and troubled, as we learned tonight in the origin story of the Whisperers (and the \u201cHave a Happy Day\u201d T-shirt).\n\nThis episode picks up where last season\u2019s Alpha backstory left off: She\u2019s fled her group after killing a few of them in front of poor Lydia, who\u2019s more like her Paw (i.e., a sane human being) than her Momma. We also know this flashback is seven years ago, because we\u2019re still doing the chapter titles thing and see \u201c7 Years Ago\u201d on the screen in big bold letters. There\u2019s Alpha and Lydia, walkin\u2019 with the dead, and in case you thought Alpha might be in the running for Mom of the Year, her response to Lydia\u2019s scream at the sight of a woman getting her face chewed off is to yell, \u201cYou almost got us killed again!\u201d And all you parents out there think you have it tough because your kid wants more time with the iPad?\n\nIt\u2019s revealing of Alpha\u2019s fearlessness that, upon encountering a huge dude with a sack over his face and machete in his hand, her instinct is to learn him somethin\u2019 right from the jump: She doesn\u2019t die easily and he\u2019ll have to kill her child, too, because Alpha ain\u2019t going anywhere without her. Lydia is understandably terrified by all of this \u2014 zombies outside, the butcher her mother\u2019s become, and now this poor man\u2019s Leatherface. When Lydia asks if the scary guy is a monster, Alpha delivers the line of the night, and what would totally be the Whisperers\u2019 slogan if they hooked up with a branding agency: \u201cWe\u2019re all monsters now.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s something I never thought we\u2019d see: Alpha and Beta\u2019s meet-cute, complete with flirting in the hallway of a psychiatric hospital and Alpha playing coy when asked about her name (\u201c\u201cThe dead don\u2019t have names,\u201d she tells him. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t either \u2026 those of us strong enough to be alive out here know each other on a primal level.\u201d) Big Man explains he ended up there because he \u201cgot into a tussle with the dead.\u201d He\u2019s also very goth, based on his love for the incessant rumble of growling zombies: \u201cIt\u2019s the only sound I never want to end.\u201d\n\nWe bounce between the past and present, with one key theme being Alpha\u2019s greatest strength: her talents as a master manipulator (something she shares with Negan). In the flashbacks, Beta is guarded, nearly cutting Alpha\u2019s hand off when she tries to touch his face. By the end, though, she\u2019s given him his name by positioning him as her subordinate. (\u201cIf I\u2019m B, what does that make you?\u201d he asks. \u201cA,\u201d she says.) She also liberates him from his last human attachment: That smiley-face tee Beta wears belonged to a now-zombified friend he was keeping alive, until Alpha knifed him. That sends Beta into a fit of rage until his new friends calm him down. \u201cThe world, it went dark so we could see a new path,\u201d Alpha tells him. \u201cWalk with me in the darkness. Walk with me and you will never be alone again, my B.\u201d That would be endearing and tender if these two weren\u2019t homicidal maniacs.\n\nCut to the present, as the Whisperers face a crisis in leadership. Ever wonder what happened to Thora Birch? We meet her and her younger sister, who both have a knack for rounding up walkers. But little sis is a bit flighty, and who can blame her \u2014 she\u2019s the mother of the baby Alpha gave up at Hilltop and suffering some serious separation anxiety. After a meltdown, she has a come-to-Bald-Lady-Jesus moment with Alpha in something called the Deeper Place, which is basically the tree in Dagobah where Luke Skywalker sees a vision of Darth Vader. The girl cries hysterically as Alpha spares the knife and instead strokes her hair. Sis tells Thora Birch that she\u2019s totally back on board with the boss lady. As far as cult leaders go, Alpha\u2019s up there with Manson and L. Ron.\n\nBut all it takes is the sight of a zombie wearing a Baby Bjorn for the girl to lose her shit again, and it\u2019s her big sister who throws her off Alpha\u2019s back and into a pack of hungry undead. Thora\u2019s reward for turning her kin into zombie jerky is a promotion and a name \u2014 Gamma, which places her third on the very limited Whisperers org chart. \u201cWe\u2019re strongest when we kill our own bluuuud,\u201d Alpha tells her during a (what else) creepy ceremony marked by chanting and close talking.\n\nBeta knows Alpha is having mommy issues of her own, though. He catches her sneaking off to a makeshift crib at their old camp, and in a rare turnabout, gets in Alpha\u2019s head, pointing out that Lydia isn\u2019t dead, and Gamma can\u2019t replace her own daughter. Alpha throws a fit just like Beta once did over the Happy Day guy (who, by the way, Beta carries with him, literally \u2014 it\u2019s his pal\u2019s face Beta wears. Kudos for setting a new standard for besties status, bro).\n\nBy the end, A and B have come full circle, rededicating themselves to \u201cthe cause\u201d and to Alpha\u2019s dirt-fisted leadership. They touch hands, chant their mission statement, and reveal themselves to basically be libertarians with less access to indoor plumbing and a more liberal view of murder: \u201cWe walk in darkness, we are free. We bathe in blood, we are free. We love nothing, we are free. We fear nothing, we are free. We need no words, we are free. We embrace our death, we are free. This is the end of the world. Now is the end of the world. We are the end of the world.\u201d\n\nWe are also at the end of the episode, as Alpha stands at the bottom of a ravine and faces off with another bad mother, Carol (who\u2019s killed a child herself and yet still looks like June Cleaver by comparison). Michonne may be the leader of the survivors, but this is going to be Carol\u2019s fight \u2014 mama a mama.", "description": "A flashback to the Whisperers\u2019 origin story reveals Alpha\u2019s talents as a master manipulator.
