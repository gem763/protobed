When a fan got the opportunity to ask Henry Winkler, 73, about the alleged conflict between him and Hanks during an episode of Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen on Thursday, the 73-year-old Happy days actor wasn't holding back\n\n'Is that a thing?' Cohen asks incredulously.\n\n'What did you say?' Winkler jokes, cupping his ear as if trying to hear better before going on to explain.\n\n'I was directing that movie for 13 days, and then I was called into [former Walt Disney Studios chairman] Jeff Katzenberg\u2018s office and he said \"Do you have everything with you? Go home,\"' he explained.\n\n'I got along great, great\u2026with that dog. That dog\u2026love that dog,' Winkler continued.\n\nDad jokes: 'What did you say?' Winkler jokes, cupping his ear as if trying to hear better before going on to explain\n\nIt was rumored, but never confirmed, that Hanks and Winkler often fought on set of the buddy cop film and it was Hanks who was responsible for his firing.\n\nAfter he was fired just 13 days into the shoot, Winkler was replaced by British-Canadian Director Roger Spottiswoode.\n\nTurner & Hooch tells the story of Detective Scott Turner (Hanks) who, after inheriting his friends' dog when he's mysteriously killed, sets out to find the murderer with his new canine friend.\n\nIt's been thirty years since the release of the film, and the Barry actor still refuses to admit if he's seen it, answering the second part of the question with: 'I don\u2019t remember the title of that movie.'\n\n30-year-feud: It was rumored, but never confirmed, that Tom Hanks, 63, and Winkler often fought on set of the buddy cop film and it was Hanks who was responsible for his firing (Turner and Hooch, 1989)\n\nAnd Winkler's answer has been pretty consistent. Back in 1993, Winkler told People, 'I got along better with Hooch than I did with Turner,' referencing Tom Hanks' character, Detective Scott Turner.\n\nHanks, 63, actually got his big break on Winkler's show Happy Days when he appeared as a guest star in 1982.\n\nIn a role that would foreshadow their eventual\u2014or continual\u2014feud, Hanks and The Fonz actually get in a bar brawl in the episode.", "description": "It's been rumored since 1989 that Henry Winkler and Tom Hanks don't get along.
