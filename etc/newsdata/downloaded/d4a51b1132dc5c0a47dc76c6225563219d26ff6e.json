Thibault, the WNBA's winningest coach, initially made his mark the Sun, taking them to back-to-back Finals in 2004 and 2005.\n\n\"A lot of people questioned why I went to a team that hadn't been to the playoffs in a while,\" said Delle Donne, who requested a trade from the Chicago Sky to the Mystics following the 2016 season. \"And I saw it in Coach, I knew he was building something reallys special. That's why this means so much to get this with him.\"\n\nWashington Mystics guard Kristi Toliver, left, shoots over Connecticut Sun guard Jasmine Thomas in the decisive Game 5 of the WNBA Finals.

In attendance: Wizards guards Bradley Beal and John Wall \u2013 both wearing Kristi Toliver jerseys \u2013 Wizards coach Scott Brooks and representing the highest court in the land, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan.\n\nWhile Delle Donne, who played a portion of this series with a herniated disk, had 21 points and nine rebounds, Meesseman was the star of the game and the series. The Belgian forward scored 15 of her team-high 22 points in the second half, including 11 in the third quarter, on her way to earning WNBA Finals MVP honors. Meeseman averaged 17.8 points and shot 57.1% from the field, including 9-for-13 in Game 5.\n\nConnecticut led 70-67 with 6:44 left in the fourth quarter. On Washington\u2019s next possession, Cloud drained a 3-pointer then followed it up with a two, giving Washington a 72-70 lead. Meesseman capped 13-2 run with another bucket, putting the Mystics up 80-72.\n\nCloud had nine of her 18 points in the fourth quarter, and Kristi Tolliver, who recovered from sloppy play early in the third quarter, added 17 points for the Mystics.\n\nAll-Star Jonquel Jones led the Sun with 25 points, and All-Star teammate Alyssa Jones had 21 points and 12 rebounds.\n\nWashington was playing in its second consecutive Finals after being swept by Seattle a year ago.", "description": "It was the Mystics\u2019 first championship,\u00a0the first title for Delle Donne and the first WNBA title for the league's winningest coach, Mike Thibault.", "authors": ["Jeff Zillgitt", "Published P.M.
