Therefore, I am contributing the amount of their contributions to charities that serve abused women and children and the elderly in Central Texas.\"\n\nTWO GIULIANI ASSOCIATES LINKED TO UKRAINE INVESTIGATIONS INDICTED ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE CHARGES\n\nFederal prosecutors say that one of the arrested men, Lev Parnas, urged an unidentified congressman to seek the ouster of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich at the behest of Ukrainian government officials. That happened about the same time that Parnas and his co-defendant Igor Fruman committed to raising more than $20,000 for the politician.\n\nAn indictment against Parnas and Fruman filed in the Southern District of New York does not accuse Sessions of wrongdoing or mention him by name, simply referring to the person as \"Congressman 1.\" But donations made by Parnas and Fruman match campaign finance reports for Sessions.\n\nSessions, who served in the House of Representatives for 11 terms before losing his seat to Democrat Colin Allred in 2018, announced recently that he will be throwing his hat in the ring for Texas' 17th congressional district seat after GOP incumbent Rep. Bill Flores announced he'd be retiring ahead of the 2020 election cycle.\n\nParnas and Fruman's shell company Global Energy Producers (GEP) allegedly contributed $325,000 and $15,000 to separate committees in May 2018, \u201cto obtain access to exclusive political events and gain influence with politicians,\u201d the indictment says. They allegedly incorporated GEP around the time the contributions were made.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAccording to FEC records, GEP contributed $325,000 in May 2018 to pro-Trump super PAC America First Action. In a statement, a spokesperson for America First Action noted that a complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in July 2018 over this contribution in addition to separate litigation in Florida. The statement said that the money was placed \"in a segregated bank account,\" was not used, and \"will remain in this segregated account until these matters are resolved.\n\nFox News' Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report.", "description": "A former Texas congressman who received at least $20,000 in campaign contributions from two associates of Rudy Giuliani\u00a0who\u00a0were arrested Thursday for campaign finance violations, has said he will donate the funds to local charities.", "authors": ["Vandana Rambaran", "Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News", "Politics At Foxnews.Com.
