It means so much to everyone. You can see at different periods someone wrestled it back into our favour.\u201d\n\nEngland made 294 in their first innings after being put into bat and Jofra Archer took six wickets as Australia were bowled out for 225 to give the hosts control of the match.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in this series we felt in front of the game all of the way through. We have to get used to it more and more,\u201d Root said.\n\nJoe Denly made a battling 94 to ensure England had a healthy lead and despite Matthew Wade\u2019s defiant century, fast bowler Stuart Broad and spinner Jack Leach took four wickets each on the fourth day to secure victory for Root\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cI thought we were brilliant,\u201d the captain said. \u201cTo bounce back from a very difficult emotional week, to come and play in the manner we have, the team has character in abundance.\u201d\n\nEngland had been criticised for some lacklustre performances in the Ashes following their World Cup victory on home soil and Root admitted they had not been good enough at times.\n\n\u201cThis was more of a template of how to play moving forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a step in the right direction. I am very proud of everyone\u2019s effort throughout the summer.\u201d\n\nArcher was part of the World Cup-winning side before making his test debut against the Australians at Lord\u2019s.\n\nHe hit Australia\u2019s Steve Smith with a short ball which forced the batsman to miss the third test, but Smith returned for the final two matches to take his tally for the series to 774 runs.\n\n\u201cFrom the moment I have put an England shirt on it has been exciting cricket,\u201d Archer said. \u201cI am glad we were able to draw the series. Jeez... bowling at Steve Smith was a task. I am glad to see the back of him.\u201d", "description": "England captain Joe Root spoke of his pride in his team after they won the final test against Australia by 135 runs on Sunday to draw the Ashes series 2-2.", "authors": ["Ed Osmond", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430187036&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0P9", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
