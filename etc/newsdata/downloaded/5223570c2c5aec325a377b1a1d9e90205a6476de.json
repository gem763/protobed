Now, \"Star Wars\" fans can look forward to an \"immersive hotel\" that will aim to make them feel like they're really living in \"a galaxy far, far away,\" with a new \"Star Wars\"-themed hotel at its Florida theme park and resort. Called Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, the hotel does not yet have a planned opening date, but Disney recently revealed the first details. Disney describes the hotel as a \"two-night experience\" where guests will spend roughly 48 hours interacting with \"Star Wars\" characters and other \"passengers\" on the Starcruiser, as the hotel will be built to resemble an intergalactic spaceship, called the Halcyon.\n\nA concept image of the Halcyon spaceship.

And Disney executives also teased the fact that the hotel's interactive experiences will include staged battles between the Starcruiser and enemy ships. Also featured in the Starcruiser hotel will be a \"Star Wars\"-themed bar, called the Silver C Lounge, as well as passenger cabins that include windows with views of the \"Star Wars\" galaxy. In addition to featuring an \"alien crew,\" every window on the Starcruiser offers views into deep space with \"ever-changing vistas as the ship progresses from place to place,\" Morrow Johnson said at D23.\n\nA model of the Halcyon spaceship on display at Disney's D23 Expo.
