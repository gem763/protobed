Although she didn\u2019t have experience as a singer and musical artist, she was eager to find a way to break in. Luckily, she found just the thing that would take her career to the next level.\n\nBut it almost didn\u2019t happen.\n\nAbdul\u2019s mom Lorraine, who worked in the film industry as an assistant to movie director Billy Wilder, had her own assistant whose boyfriend, musician and producer Elliot Wolff, had written a few songs.\n\n\u201cMy mother\u2019s young assistant walked up to my mother and said, \u2018Miss Abdul, my boyfriend\u2019s an aspiring songwriter.\u2019 And my mom said, \u2018Who\u2019s he written for?\u2019 And she goes, \u2018Well, nobody that\u2019s notable yet, but can I submit a song from him?\u2019 And my mom said, \u2018Sure,\u2019\u201d Abdul recalled in an interview with HuffPost at Build Series.\n\nShortly after that, Abdul made her weekly visit to her parents\u2019 house for \u201cchicken and Rice-a-Roni.\u201d Her mom told her about Wolff\u2019s demo, calling it \u201cthe most God-awful thing you\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d Still, her mom played Abdul the cassette.\n\n\u201cIt was like an eight-track recording with someone plunking on a computer and singing notes that I\u2019ve never heard of, like in-between notes. It was strange. We were laughing and crying, and my mother threw it in the trash can. And I dug it out of the trash can and said, \u2018There\u2019s something really cool about this song.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat song was \u201cStraight Up.\u201d\n\nJP YIM Paula Abdul has Las Vegas residency dates lined up at the Flamingo through the end of 2019.\n\nAbdul soon approached her record company with Wolff\u2019s demo.\n\n\u201cThey looked at me like, are you crazy?\u201d said Abdul. But she begged the label to let her record the song.\n\nWhen the record executives agreed, Abdul recorded the track, along with Wolff\u2019s other song, \u201cCold Hearted,\u201d inside his small apartment \u2015 in the shower, she said. Abdul told HuffPost that in the original master recordings, you could actually hear a neighbor banging on the wall next door and shouting \u201cShut up!\u201d\n\n\u201cStraight Up\u201d hit No. 1, and with the success of subsequent singles as well, Abdul became the first woman to notch four No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 singles off a debut album.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat changed my life,\u201d she said.\n\nMichael Ochs Archives via Getty Images Abdul's debut album, \"Forever Your Girl,\" came out in 1988.\n\nEternally grateful, Abdul doesn\u2019t tire of performing the song live, especially in Vegas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very interactive with the audience. It\u2019s a visual feast. Everyone\u2019s standing up and singing,\u201d she said of her stage show, which incorporates theatrics and storytelling. And yes, MC Skat Kat, the animated cartoon from Abdul\u2019s \u201cOpposites Attract\u201d video, also makes an appearance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different kind of show, and it\u2019s just very joyful. And it\u2019s funny,\u201d she said.\n\nStaying true to her core, Abdul showcases the familiar choreography from hits like \u201cStraight Up,\u201d alongside new moves throughout the concert.\n\n\u201cAnd in case you\u2019re wondering if I jump off of things, I do. And I get it over within the very first number!\u201d\n\nCheck out the full Build Series interview with Paula Abdul below, and go here to see her dates at the Flamingo Las Vegas.", "description": "The singer, who's currently doing a Las Vegas residency, knows a good thing when she hears it.", "authors": ["Editorial Director", "Entertainment - Huffpost"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daa1830210000aa1334a68f.jpeg?cache=od8ukuw2vh&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
