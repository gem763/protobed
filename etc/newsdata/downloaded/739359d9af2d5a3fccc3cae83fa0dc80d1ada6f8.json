underway as Typhoon Hagibis kills four in Japan", "language": "en", "text": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Japan\u2019s military scrambled Sunday to rescue people trapped by flooding in the aftermath of powerful Typhoon Hagibis, which killed at least four people, caused landslides and burst rivers.\n\nBy Sunday morning, the significantly weakened storm had moved back off land, but it left in its wake a trail of destruction and forced Rugby World Cup organisers to cancel another match.\n\nSerious flooding was reported in central Japan\u2019s Nagano, where a burst levee sent swollen waters from the Chikuma river gushing into residential neighbourhoods, flooding homes up to the second floor.\n\nJapan\u2019s military deployed helicopters to rescue people seen in aerial footage standing on balconies waving towels to attract attention.\n\n\u201cOvernight, we issued evacuation orders to 427 households, 1,417 individuals,\u201d Yasuhiro Yamaguchi, an emergency official at Nagano city, told AFP.\n\n\u201cIt is not clear how many of those households have been affected,\u201d he added, saying while the river level was no longer on the rise, water was still going higher in residential areas.\n\nAerial footage showed a row of bullet trains half-submerged in muddy waters at a depot in Nagano.\n\nOvernight Saturday, more than seven million people were placed under non-compulsory evacuation orders, with tens of thousands heeding the call and moving into government shelters to ride out the storm.\n\nHagibis caused transport chaos over a long holiday weekend in Japan, grounding all flights in the Tokyo region, and forcing the suspension of most trains and many bullet trains serving the capital.\n\nHagibis smashed into the main Japanese island of Honshu around 7:00 pm (1000 GMT) Saturday as one of the most violent typhoons in recent years, with wind gusts of up to 216 kilometres per hour (134 miles per hour).\n\n\u2013 Four dead, 17 missing \u2013\n\nWell before making landfall, the outer bands of the storm claimed their first victim, a driver whose van was flipped over in the strong gusts.\n\nThe second confirmed death was a man in his 60s killed in a landslide north of Tokyo.\n\nAnother man in his 60s was also confirmed dead after he was pulled from his flooded home in Kawasaki city, near Tokyo.\n\n\u201cThe house was two to three metres (yards) under water and the team rescued the man from there\u201d but he was confirmed dead later, local fire department official Kiichi Hayakawa told AFP.\n\nA fourth person, a woman, was in \u201ccardio-respiratory\u201d arrest \u2014 a term often used in Japan before an official doctor certifies death \u2014 after being pulled from a home engulfed by a landslide in Samigahara, southwest of Tokyo, local media said.\n\nNational broadcaster NHK said at least 99 people had been injured and 17 were missing after the storm, including several swept away in flood waters.\n\nWhile Hagibis packed intense winds that damaged homes in Chiba, east of Tokyo, even before it hit land, it was the hours of torrential rain that prompted the Japanese Meteorological Agency to issue its highest-level emergency warning, advising people to seek shelter.\n\n\u2013 Third rugby match cancelled \u2013\n\n\u201cUnprecedented heavy rain has been seen in cities, towns and villages for which the emergency warning was issued,\u201d JMA forecaster Yasushi Kajiwara told reporters.\n\n\u201cIt is important to take action that can help save your lives.\u201d\n\nAcross large swathes of the Tokyo region and central Japan, rivers burst their banks and authorities implemented emergency discharges from dams that had reached maximum capacity.\n\nThe storm wreaked havoc even before arriving in Japan, forcing the delay of Japanese Grand Prix qualifiers and the cancellation of two Saturday Rugby World Cup matches.\n\nOn Sunday morning, organisers said they had been forced to cancel a third fixture \u2014 Namibia-Canada \u2014 but gave the go-ahead to two others and were weighing up the fourth match scheduled, the crunch Japan-Scotland game.\n\n\u201cWe were left with no option but to cancel the match on safety grounds,\u201d said tournament director Alan Gilpin.\n\nThe cancellation is a blow for the northern town of Kamaishi, which was nearly wiped off the map by the 2011 tsunami disaster and has participated as a host city in a show of its recovery.\n\nAll eyes are now on whether the do-or-die match between hosts Japan and Scotland in Yokohama will go ahead, with the Scots threatening legal action if it is prevented from playing the game and automatically eliminated.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Japan\u2019s military scrambled Sunday to rescue people trapped by flooding in the
