Each training I\u2019m suffering because of pain. Every race I train hard. Training and riding and doing competition are medicine for me. I push so hard \u2013 to push literally all my fear and everything away.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2008, Vervoort signed documentation which would one day allow a doctor to end her life.\n\nShe said: \u2018I\u2019m really scared, but those [euthanasia] papers give me a lot of peace of mind because I know when it\u2019s enough for me, I have those papers.\n\n\u2018If I didn\u2019t have those papers, I think I\u2019d have done suicide already. I think there will be fewer suicides when every country has the law of euthanasia. I hope everybody sees that this is not murder, but it makes people live longer.\u2019\n\nVervoort lived with an incurable degenerative disease (Picture: Gareth Copley/Getty)\n\nIs euthanasia legal?\n\nEuthanasia \u2013 the act of deliberately ending a person\u2019s life to relieve them from suffering \u2013 is legal in Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Canada and Colombia.\n\nIt is not the same as assisted suicide \u2013 deliberately assisting or encouraging another person to kill themselves \u2013 however the latter is legal in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany and a number of US states.\n\nBoth euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal under English law with euthanasia considered manslaughter or murder, depending on circumstances, and assisted suicide punishable by up to 14 years\u2019 imprisonment.", "description": "Marieke Vervoort has ended her own life 11 years after signing documentation allowing doctors to do so through euthanasia.", "authors": ["Zaina Alibhai"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91394419_1571821516.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
