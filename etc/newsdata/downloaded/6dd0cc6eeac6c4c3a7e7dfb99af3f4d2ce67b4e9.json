REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\n(Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp has filed an antitrust lawsuit against a SoftBank Group Corp-owned investment company alleging the firm stockpiled patents to hold up technology companies with numerous lawsuits.\n\nThe complaint filed late Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Jose alleged that Fortress Investment Group, which SoftBank bought in 2017 for $3.3 billion, acquired control of more than 1,000 U.S. technology patents.\n\nIntel said that Fortress and other companies it owns or controls filed lawsuits against the Santa Clara chipmaker claiming that nearly every Intel processor made since 2011 infringed patents the companies had obtained control of from NXP Semiconductors.\n\n\u201cOne way in which Fortress has tried to turn around its performance and justify SoftBank\u2019s investment in it is through increased speculation on patent assertions,\u201d the lawsuit said.\n\n\u201cIntel brings this complaint to end a campaign of anticompetitive patent aggregation by Fortress and a web of (patent assertion entities) that Fortress owns or controls.\u201d\n\nSoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. SoftBank also owns Arm Holdings, a British chip firm whose technology is making inroads on key Intel markets such as personal computers and data centers.\n\nIntel said Fortress\u2019 efforts to gather patents constituted anticompetitive behavior because they were driven by the idea that its purchases would cost less than what technology companies would pay to avoid lawsuits.\n\n\u201cFortress\u2019 aggregation is intended for an anticompetitive purpose\u2014to invest in patents at costs lower than the holdup value of the patents,\u201d Intel wrote in its complaint.", "description": "Chipmaker Intel Corp has filed an antitrust lawsuit against a SoftBank Group Corp-owned investment company alleging the firm stockpiled patents to hold up technology companies with numerous lawsuits.", "authors": ["Stephen Nellis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1443939687&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L1TU", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
