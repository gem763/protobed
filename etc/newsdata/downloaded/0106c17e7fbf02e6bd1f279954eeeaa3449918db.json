That figure could not be immediately confirmed.\n\nThere are reportedly as many as 12,000 people held at the camp.\n\nBoth the SDF and U.S. military officials have warned that Turkey\u2019s incursion into northern Syria could result in the escape of ISIS soldiers. The SDF, a key American partner in the years-long fight against the group, is currently responsible for guarding captured ISIS fighters.\n\nBut the Kurdish-led SDF says it must pull personnel from prison facilities in order to battle the Turkish military, leading to the increasing likelihood of mass prison breaks.\n\n\u201cThe guarding is very weak now,\u201d said SDF spokesman Marvan Qamishlo, according to Reuters.\n\nPresident Trump last week pulled about 50 U.S. special forces personnel from key buffer zones along the Syria-Turkey border. Critics argue that removing those troops essentially gave Turkey a green light to invade, though the president and top Pentagon officials have publicly opposed the Turkish invasion.\n\nTurkey considers elements of the SDF to be terrorists and has vowed to remove what it views as a threat along its border.\n\nCritics of the president\u2019s decision, including many Republicans, have said that an Islamic State resurgence is likely as the SDF can no longer guard prison camps or conduct effective military operations against the group.\n\nU.S. military officials have stressed that it is now Turkey\u2019s responsibility to ensure ISIS prisoners and their supporters do not escape, but it\u2019s unclear whether Ankara will make that a priority.\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s Turkish responsibility to secure those prisoners,\u201d U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley told reporters at the Pentagon last Friday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
