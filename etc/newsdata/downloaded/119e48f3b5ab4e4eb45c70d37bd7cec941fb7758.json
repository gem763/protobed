Biles' U.S. teammate Jade Carey took the silver on 14.883, with Ellie Downie of Britain third on 14.816.\n\nThat took Biles to 23 career world championship medals, equaling the mark set by Belarusian Vitaly Scherbo for any gymnast, male or female.\n\nBiles has the chance to take the record outright in Sunday's balance beam and floor events.\n\n'I think it's impressive. Also, I don't really think of it going into the competition, because I feel that kind of weighs heavy on me,' Biles said. 'I just go in, do what I'm supposed to, and whatever the outcome is, I just kind of let it happen.'\n\nThe 22-year-old American had the chance to make it 24 in the uneven bars, but couldn't repeat her silver-medal performance from last year and finished fifth.\n\nSimon Biles won the vault in Germany on Saturday with a score of 15.399\n\nThe American star earned her 23rd championship title, tying the record set by Belarusian Vitaly Scherbo for any gymnast, male or female\n\nBelgian uneven bars specialist Nina Derwael retained her world title with a score of 15.233, ahead of Britain's Becky Downie on 15, one of two sisters to win medals Saturday. Sunisa Lee took bronze for the U.S. on 14.8.\n\nBiles scored 14.7, finishing by sticking the landing on a dismount with two flips and two twists.\n\nThe uneven bars has traditionally been her weakest event and was the only one in which she didn't win a medal at the 2016 Olympics.\n\n'Right now, I couldn't be more happy with the performances I put out today. Obviously no medal on bars, but I'm not even mad about it,' Biles said.\n\n'I knew going into today there was a very slim chance that I would even medal, but to make a bar final and get to represent the country, I feel really proud because this is not one of my strong suits. But it's getting up there and I just feel really proud.'\n\nOf Biles' 23 world championship medals, 17 are gold against 11 for Scherbo, who won his from 1991 through 1996. Scherbo competed at four world championships, against Biles' five, but the men's program contains more events.\n\nBiles' U.S. teammate Jade Carey took the silver on 14.883, with Ellie Downie of Britain third on 14.816\n\nBiles has the chance to beat the record in Sunday's balance beam and floor events\n\nI don't really think of it going into the competition, because I feel that kind of weighs heavy on me,' Biles said.

Xiao Ruoteng of China took bronze with 14.933.\n\n'Right now, I couldn't be more happy with the performances I put out today. Obviously no medal on bars, but I'm not even mad about it,' Biles said\n\nYulo said he hoped his win would improve the popularity of gymnastics in the Philippines.\n\n'Filipinos, they like basketball, but we're small. Maybe they should try gymnastics first. It's more fun,' said Yulo, who trains in Japan.\n\nWhitlock scored 15.5 with a high-difficulty routine in the pommel horse.\n\nLee Chih-Kai took silver for Taiwan on 15.433, while Rhys McClenaghan won the bronze on 15.4 as the first Irish gymnast ever to compete in a world championship final.\n\nIbrahim Colak won on rings for Turkey with 14.933, beating Italy's Marco Lodadio and French bronze medalist Samir Ait Said.
