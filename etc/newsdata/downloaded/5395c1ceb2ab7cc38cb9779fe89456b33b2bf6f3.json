We couldn't believe it!!!,\" they added.\n\n\"He ran past saying 'Sorry girls, sorry girls, sorry girls' over and over, and once we had passed him, he started covering his bare butt!!!!\"\n\nMs Price is said to have reported the man to the police, but was told he wasn't doing anything illegal.\n\nHowever, one officer did say that they would investigate the issue if further reports came in.", "description": "Hikers have recalled the bizarre moment they came across a jogger dressed only in a pink G-string and work boots", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20554158.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Wild-Horse-Mountain.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
