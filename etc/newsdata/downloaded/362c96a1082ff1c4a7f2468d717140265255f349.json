Now the inquiry has gone global.\n\nAs last week came to a close, Donald Trump was confronting the most serious crisis of his presidency, as Democrats moved forward with impeachment hearings in a serious scandal over his pressuring Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election.\n\nSeven days later, the scandal is even more serious, but it has metastasized. This is no longer a controversy about a whistle-blower complaint, an American ally in eastern Europe, and the president. It is now an all-encompassing scandal, involving many of the top officials in the Trump administration pressuring countries around the world, from Australia to Ukraine and China to Great Britain.\n\nWhat has changed is not the facts, but what the public knows. It\u2019s clear now that the president, his vice president, and several of his top, Senate-confirmed aides\u2014as well as his personal lawyer cum private foreign minister, Rudy Giuliani\u2014 have spent significant time over the past year trying to pressure foreign governments into producing stories that can aid in Trump\u2019s reelection.", "description": "Russia\u2019s election-hack gamble, God\u2019s plan for Mike Pence, and the case against college for everyone.
