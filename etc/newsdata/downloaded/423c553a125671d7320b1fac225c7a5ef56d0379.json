(Fred Lee/Getty Images)\n\nMister Roger Federer is usually coolness personified, but that certainly wasn\u2019t the case on this one night in Shanghai.\n\nPlaying a tightly contested, emotionally draining Masters quarterfinal against the up-and-coming Alexander Zverev, Federer showed some frustration just as it was all coming apart.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAfter saving five match points in the second set and then going on to force a deciding third, Zverev took a commanding 3-0 lead in the decider to push arguably the greatest player of all time to let off some steam. Falling behind 15-30 on his own serve after a missed backhand volley, Federer calmly sent a ball into the stands.\n\nAfter the ball reached its destination, chair umpire Nacho Forcadell called a code violation for violent conduct \u2014 Federer\u2019s second of the match since he had already sent another ball into the stands earlier \u2014 which cost the 38-year-old an additional point and handed Zverev two break point opportunities.\n\nSensing some injustice, Federer immediately made his way over to Forcadell to question the decision.\n\n\u201cHow did I hit the ball? With the frame. Was it in anger, for you?\u201d Federer said. To which Forcadell responded, \u201cMaybe it was not with full power ... but it was out of the court.\u201d\n\nFederer then angrily responded with, \u201cI\u2019ll show you what full is.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chair umpire then explained that it was not so much about where the ball ultimately landed, but the action itself. Federer argued he should have been made aware after his first violation that there was no margin for error, but to no avail. He never recovered and lost 3-6, 7-6(7), 3-6.\n\nRight decision?\n\nYes and no. By the rulebook, a ball being sent into the crowd is considered a violation as it\u2019s a measure to protect fans in the stands. If the rules are being enforced to the absolute letter of the law, as it seemed to be when Federer picked up his first violation, then sure, it was the right call. One could even argue that had he not made the call, another can of worms would have been opened with Zverev possibly questioning why there was no penalty.\n\nBut, chair umpires exist for a reason. They\u2019re human, they\u2019re supposed to be understanding of the tone and tenor of matches and the players involved. There is clearly no malicious intent in Federer\u2019s actions, just some frustration over an important match slipping away.\n\nConsidering all that he did to fight back after losing the first set and saving five match points in the second, Forcadell should have been able to recognize what was happening and let it go. Oh, perhaps cutting the 20-time Grand Slam winner a bit of slack would have been within his rights, too.\n\nIf there is anything to blame Federer for, it\u2019s perhaps not knowing Forcadell\u2019s tendencies before the match. It certainly appears the umpire is the strict type and follows the rules to a T, ironically penalizing Zverev earlier this year at the Madrid Open for taking too long to serve. The German was so angry about the decision he even called the match supervisor onto the court, but as in Federer\u2019s case, there was no changing the decision.\n\nNo talking mood\n\nFederer clearly had no intention of discussing the incident after the match, abruptly dismissing a question from a reporter about why he was unhappy with the umpire\u2019s decision during the post-match press conference.\n\n\u201cSo you can write on Twitter, you mean?\u201d Federer said. \u201cIt would be nice [for you] to write something nice once also about the game... Next question.\u201d\n\nI missed quite a Federer-Zverev match in Shanghai, huh.\n\n\n\nAnd after, too. I've never seen Federer snap at a [100% expectable and reasonable] question like this, that I can remember. pic.twitter.com/d6yplK1e8U \u2014 Ben Rothenberg (@BenRothenberg) October 11, 2019\n\nThis could have been more a case of Federer not wanting the spotlight to be on a point penalty rather than the great match and thoroughly deserving win for Zverev. Still, considering the usual grace and composure with which the Swiss conducts himself, it was a bit strange to see him so on edge after a match.\n\nMore tennis coverage from Yahoo Sports", "description": "Roger Federer let his emotions get the best of him during a loss to Alexander Zverev in the Shanghai Masters quarterfinal.", "authors": ["Vivek Jacob"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4s85qJBP8oXK8IB2fM8yZw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjEuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9dE9LgqxAfnqeFgThfP2mw--~B/aD0yMjAwO3c9MzkwODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/6048aac0-ec73-11e9-bf7f-ffe07176ca9d", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
