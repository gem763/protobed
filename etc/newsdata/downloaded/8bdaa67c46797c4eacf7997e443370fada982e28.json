(AP) - A new Republican attack ad slams Democrat Andy Beshear for backing the Affordable Care Act and opposing Gov. Matt Bevin\u2019s efforts to impose work requirements for some Medicaid recipients - the latest sign that health care looms large in Kentucky\u2019s race for governor.\n\nThe TV ad backed by the Republican Governors Association overlaps a Beshear campaign commercial in which the Democratic challenger touts his efforts to protect health coverage for pre-existing conditions as attorney general and promises to do the same if elected governor.\n\nThe GOP commercial lambasts Beshear for espousing \u201cradical views\u201d on health care.\n\nBeshear\u2019s campaign fired back Friday, calling it a desperate smear while accusing Bevin of trying to \u201crip health care away\u201d from tens of thousands of Kentuckians.\n\nWith Kentucky\u2019s election less than two months away, Bevin and Beshear are waging a bitter campaign being watched closely for potential trends that could carry over into the 2020 national election. The new RGA-backed commercial also shows the GOP\u2019s willingness to confront Beshear on health care - an issue the Democrat sees as one his family has championed.\n\nThe ACA, the health care law backed by former Democratic President Barack Obama, gave states the option of expanding Medicaid coverage to able-bodied adults. Beshear\u2019s father, former Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear, used an executive order to accomplish that. His order increased Medicaid rolls by more than 400,000 people, many getting coverage for the first time.\n\nIn a state plagued by high rates of cancer and other diseases, the uninsured rate dropped dramatically after the law, known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d was implemented.\n\nThe new GOP ad characterizes that law as a \u201cWashington takeover\u201d of health care that resulted in \u201ctoo many families paying more but getting less.\u201d\n\n\u201cAndy Beshear supported the government takeover of health care,\u201d the ad says. \u201cNow Beshear supports giving taxpayer-funded health care benefits to people who can work but choose not to.\u201d\n\nBeshear calls health care a \u201cbasic human right\u201d and says he\u2019ll push to insert ACA consumer protections into state law if he\u2019s elected governor. The health care law maintained job-based and private health coverage.\n\nBeshear\u2019s campaign said Friday that health care is \u201con the ballot\u201d in the governor\u2019s race and portrayed him as \u201cthe only candidate who can be trusted to do right by Kentucky families.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo amount of desperate smears from Matt Bevin\u2019s allies will let this governor escape his failed record of trying to rip health care away from Kentuckians,\u201d Beshear campaign spokesman Sam Newton said in a statement.\n\nBevin has said the Medicaid expansion by Beshear\u2019s father was too expensive. Bevin\u2019s administration won permission from the Trump administration to require some Medicaid recipients to get a job, go to school or volunteer to keep their benefits. The state also planned to impose small monthly premiums from those Medicaid recipients to mimic private insurance plans.\n\nA federal judge blocked the work requirements and Bevin\u2019s administration is appealing.\n\nBevin and Beshear already have clashed on the Medicaid issue. Beshear calls the governor\u2019s plan \u201ccallous\u201d and says it would hurt health care in rural Kentucky.\n\nBevin defended the Medicaid proposal after a forum this summer, telling reporters: \u201cI can\u2019t believe he (Beshear) would stand here quite seriously and say that it\u2019s inappropriate to ask able-bodied men and women, who have no children, to do something in exchange for free health care.\u201d\n\nBevin\u2019s administration has predicted the requirements would save the state hundreds of millions of dollars over several years. State officials estimated at least 95,000 people would lose coverage, either through not complying with the rules or by getting jobs and earning enough money to make them ineligible for the benefits.\n\nThe new GOP ad is the latest from outside groups trying to help sway Kentucky\u2019s election. The RGA started attacking Beshear right after the May primary.\n\nThe Democratic Governors Association countered with ads praising Beshear. A DGA-affiliated group recently signaled plans to pump nearly $4 million into advertising until Election Day.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A new Republican attack ad slams Democrat Andy Beshear for backing the Affordable Care Act and opposing Gov.
