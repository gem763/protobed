(NBC has denied that is \"spiked\" the story.)\n\nPage Six reports that execs at NBC at braced for major new claims to be made public about the network and Lauer's alleged inappropriate relationships with young women at \"Today.\"\n\n\"They\u2019re bracing for bombshells,\" an insider told the outlet.\n\nIn addition to reportedly featuring interviews with \"a number of women with new claims\" against the ousted \"Today\" co-anchor, Farrow's bombshell book will also contain new information from Lauer's initial accuser, whose claims of sexual misconduct resulted in his firing from NBC. She will also publicly identify herself for the first time in \"Catch and Kill.\"\n\nPage Six reports that the still-unnamed woman was former \"Today\" show co-anchor Meredith Vieira's ex-assistant who became a producer on the NBC morning show. She and Lauer reportedly had a long-term \"affair\" starting at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.\n\nAs for the rest of what \"Catch and Kill\" focuses on, the publisher Little, Brown and Company, said that it details the \"surveillance and intimidation deployed by wealthy and connected men to threaten journalists, evade accountability and silence victims of abuse. And it\u2019s the story of the women who risked everything to expose the truth.\"\n\nWhile NBC is braced for what the book has to say about its reported dealings with its author, other networks are also gearing up for its highly-anticipated release.\n\n\"It\u2019s a highly-anticipated release in other newsrooms,\" an industry insider told Page Six. \"Ronan usually does quite a bit of press for his reporting so you have to imagine the book will dominate the news cycle for several days.\"\n\n\"Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators\" will be released on October 15.
