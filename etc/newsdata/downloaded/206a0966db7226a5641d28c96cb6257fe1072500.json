He's only the second analyst to recommend selling the stock.\n\nHe thinks Beyond is overshooting its forecasts for how much market share it can capture from traditional meat.\n\nStill, he likes the potential in plant-based meat and says Beyond Meat has a distinct first mover advantage.\n\nWatch Beyond Meat trade live on Markets Insider.\n\nThe latest Wall Street analyst to weigh in on Beyond Meat thinks highly of the company and plant-based meat, but still thinks that at the current price it's a good time to sell.\n\nHolland initiated coverage in September with an underweight rating a price target of $130, a 15% discount from where Beyond currently trades. Holland says he believes in plant-based meat, just not Beyond's more than $9 billion valuation.\n\nHis price target is based off a five-year sales outlook plus a 50% premium to growth staples because of the long runway for plant-based meat.\n\n\"I think it's going to be a tremendous category is going to be one of the fastest growing categories in food,\" Brian Holland, a senior analyst at D.A. Davidson, told Markets Insider in an interview. \"But I think there are limiting factors\" to Beyond Meat's growth, he said.\n\nWall Street has been very hesitant on Beyond Meat during the short time its traded publicly \u2014 the company IPOed in May. Of the 10 analysts that cover the shares, seven have neutral ratings on the company. Only one analyst \u2014 Ken Goldman of JPMorgan\u2014 has a buy rating on shares. When Holland initiated coverage, he became the second \"sell\" rating.\n\nIn a recent investor presentation, Beyond Meat spelled out plans to capture 13% of the US market share of traditional meat, about $35 billion of the $270 billion industry in the US. The company arrived at this number by calculating how much of the dairy milk market has been captured by plant-based milk.\n\nRead more: These are Beyond Meat's 13 highest-profile partnerships in the food industry\n\nBut Holland is skeptical that Beyond can woo enough repeat consumers to grow that much.\n\n\"At the end of the day when you sell a food product, you only have the attention span of the consumer for as long as they have your package in their refrigerator or eating your sandwich at a restaurant,\" Holland said.\n\nAfter that, its can be difficult to keep consumers engaged. He argues that plant-based milk has been able to do this because there's a solid share of lactose intolerant people in the US, a need for an alternative that Beyond doesn't have.\n\nThere's also healthy competition in the plant-based meat space, and because of that Beyond's valuation \"demands higher barriers to entry than do exist here,\" he said. A number of other companies have recently gotten in the plant-based meat game, including larger food companies such as Tyson Foods, Hormel Foods, and Kellogg.\n\nThat said, Holland thinks Beyond Meat has a distinct first-mover advantage in plant-based meat. A majority of the plant-based milk category is controlled by two top players, Holland said, who were early movers \u2014 Danone, which owns Silk, and Blue Diamond, which owns Almond Breeze.\n\nGoing forward, Holland said that he's open to reevaluating his rating. \"I don't think any stock is permanently a buy or sell,\" he said. If the numbers were revised higher, \"we would look at what the math said,\" Holland said.\n\nHe also acknowledged that a deal with McDonald's would change things for Beyond \u2014 analysts have said it could boost the stock price as much as 30% and would represent a huge win for the company, which has a lot of partnerships with restaurants.\n\nBeyond Meat's shares are up 516% year to date.\n\nMarkets Insider", "description": "Brian Holland, the latest analyst to initiate coverage of Beyond Meat, likes the company but thinks it's overvalued at currently.
