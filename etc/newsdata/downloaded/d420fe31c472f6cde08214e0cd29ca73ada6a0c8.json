This year Congress set up a panel that\u2019s focusing on how to knock the institution itself back into shape.\n\nIn hearings that have unfolded during the current impeachment drama and months before it began, the House Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress has tackled a wide range of topics, including stopping a staff brain drain, increasing civility and collaboration, and improving the budget process.\n\nThe country\u2019s founders aimed to establish Congress as the strongest branch of government, but it has been the weakest for at least a decade because it\u2019s no longer independent, said former Virginia Republican Rep. Tom Davis in a recent interview. \u201cThe president\u2019s party is basically an appendage of the executive branch, and the minority party no longer views itself as a minority shareholder. Instead, they\u2019re the opposition party,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to restore that overnight without changes in behavior by the members and in the party structure. But one thing you can do is at least increase their knowledge base,\u201d he added. Davis testified in May before the modernizing panel, calling for raising salary caps for staffers for Congressional committees, as well as for more funding for the Congressional Research Service and the Government Accountability Office, key legislative branch agencies that serve as an in-house think tank and in-house auditor, respectively.\n\nThe 2017 tax-reform law, according to its critics, is a prime example of a measure that was shaped too much by lobbyists rather than by the diminished legislative branch, with provisions that favored brewers, citrus growers and other special interests. Legislation this year that aims to revamp the U.S. retirement system has drawn similar flak, with detractors saying insurers that provide annuities are having their way with it.\n\nRep. Derek Kilmer, a Democrat from the state of Washington who chairs the modernizing committee, said his experience at consulting giant McKinsey & Co. came up in discussions before he became the panel\u2019s chairman, though mostly he just has long expressed interest in having Congress function better.\n\n\u201cWhen I was at McKinsey, I only had one or two instances where I got to work on a turnaround project,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cThis is one of the more significant turnaround projects that I\u2019ve ever been assigned.\u201d\n\nStaff pay\n\nOne idea that has come up repeatedly at the modernizing panel\u2019s hearings has been raising the pay for staff in order to attract and retain experienced aides and advisers. Republican and Democratic proponents argue that higher compensation for Capitol Hill staffers, along with other improvements, would help make Congress more effective and better equipped to stand up to lobbyists and executive-branch officials, who tend to have greater experience and bigger salaries.\n\nThe median salary for House and Senate office staffers is $52,722 and has stayed at around that level for about a decade, according to nominal figures from research firm LegiStorm. That\u2019s as annual pay for lobbyists in Washington, D.C., averages around $124,000, per Salary.com data, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, a top-paying arm of the executive branch, has an average salary of about $185,000.\n\n\u201cThe differential is just too high. It\u2019s affecting policy,\u201d Davis said, regarding the disparities in pay. The former GOP congressman now works at law and lobbying firm Holland & Knight and is part of a ReFormers Caucus at Issue One, a nonpartisan nonprofit that aims to reduce the role of big money in politics.\n\nAn effort to raise the pay of members of Congress flopped in June, as some lawmakers feared that upping their own compensation would provide fodder for attack ads at re-election time that would resonate with voters. Davis believes voters would be more willing to accept pay raises for Hill staff. He sees a 25% chance of success for such a vote once the 2020 election is over.\n\nBetsy Wright Hawkings, a consultant who previously worked for 25 years as a chief of staff for Republican lawmakers, said she was able to pay an experienced legislative assistant around $60,000 a year in 2008, when she was in a chief role. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t going to make him wealthy, but it was enough to keep him,\u201d she said in a recent interview. \u201cHe is now a chief of staff on the Hill \u2014 he has made it his career \u2014 because we were able to pay him enough to keep him on board.\u201d After budget cuts, she was only able to pay a similarly capable legislative assistant about $40,000 a year in 2014, and that staffer eventually left to work as an industry lobbyist.\n\nA salary of $40K is \u201cmore than a lot of people make, but not a lot in Washington, D.C. \u2014 and not enough to keep someone who has broad experience and knows his way around the Hill, when he could go downtown and make two or three times that lobbying,\u201d said Hawkings, who is a senior strategic adviser at Issue One and managing partner at consulting firm Article One Advisors. \u201cThere are a lot of other stories that I could tell you, but that\u2019s sort of the epitome.\u201d\n\nBut she also stressed that giving raises to Hill staff hasn\u2019t been and shouldn\u2019t be the modernizing committee\u2019s first order of business.\n\nRelated: Elizabeth Warren says new tax would make lobbying more expensive for companies like Boeing and Comcast\n\nAnd see: Drugmakers\u2019 lobbying spending at 10-year high as Washington targets soaring prices\n\nBoosting civility and collaboration\n\nOn Sept. 26, as much of Washington focused on the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, the modernizing committee actually held a hearing on \u201copportunities for increased civility and collaboration in Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my scholarly view, Congress is a victim of a cancerous phenomenon, much more than it is a willful participant in discord,\u201d said Jennifer Victor, a political science professor at Virginia\u2019s George Mason University, as she testified about partisan polarization at the hearing. Her suggestions for fighting polarization included developing an internal Facebook-like FB, +0.60% platform for facilitating interactions among Republicans and Democrats, as well as shaking up seating arrangements on the House floor and encouraging participation in bipartisan caucuses.\n\nFormer Illinois Republican Rep. Ray LaHood testified at the Sept. 26 hearing in favor of holding a bipartisan retreat for lawmakers and their families, like one that he helped run in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to trash somebody on the other side when you know their spouse or you know their kids,\u201d said LaHood, who also was the Obama administration\u2019s transportation secretary and now works for law and lobbying firm DLA Piper.\n\nGetty Images/CQ Roll Call Democratic Rep.

Tom Graves (on left) take part in a meeting of the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress.\n\nTrying again on reforming the budget process\n\nThe modernizing panel last month also started talking about improving the budget and appropriations process. Last year, another congressional committee mostly struck out in its efforts in this area, so Kilmer\u2019s panel held a hearing that featured testimony from leaders of that earlier body as well as other experts.\n\n\u201cThe congressional budget process is dead,\u201d said Bill Hoagland, a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, during the hearing, which took place Sept. 19. \u201cOver the last 12 years, Congress failed to adopt eight times \u2014 two-thirds of the time \u2014 a budget-resolution blueprint for the upcoming fiscal year.\u201d\n\nHoagland, a former Hill staffer, said he\u2019s among those who support switching to a two-year budget cycle. He told the committee: \u201cIf you want to find consensus on reasonable, doable reforms to the budget and appropriation process, biennial budgeting should be given serious consideration.\u201d\n\nRelated: This past winter\u2019s government shutdown was the longest on record by a wide margin\n\nAnd see: Senate passes spending bill that delays possibility of another government shutdown\n\nPanel\u2019s recommendations to date\n\nSo far, the modernization committee\u2019s six Republicans and six Democrats voted unanimously in favor of nearly 30 recommendations, with some related to a new human resources hub, technology revamps and transparency. The committee didn\u2019t recommend raises for staff, but it did support regularly surveying employees on improving pay and benefits.\n\nThe dozen lawmakers are \u201ctrying to start with non-controversial wins,\u201d and there are political challenges to raising staff pay thanks to \u201cso much negative talk about how Congress is wasteful,\u201d said Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at New America, a center-left think tank, in a recent interview.\n\nThe group also endorsed putting technology expenses in a centralized account rather than in member offices\u2019 budgets, raising the cap on the number of staff in member offices, allowing freshmen members to hire and pay one transition staff member and making permanent a new House Office of Diversity and Inclusion. Taking tech costs out of member offices\u2019 budgets is viewed as a way to give lawmakers more room to provide raises.\n\n\u201cEvery one of these recommendations\u201d is aimed at \u201cimproving things for the American people,\u201d said Kilmer, the Democratic congressman who chairs the modernizing committee. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking at staff retention just for the purpose of looking at staff retention. We\u2019re looking at it because in the absence of solving for that, you\u2019ve seen an eroded ability of Congress to solve problems on behalf of the American people.\u201d\n\nThe committee, by design, may offer only recommendations to the House. Still, the goal is actual change, and the group has \u201cbuilt support for each and every idea\u201d among other lawmakers, said Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Graves, the committee\u2019s vice chairman, in a recent interview.", "description": "This year Congress set up a panel that\u2019s focusing on how to knock the institution itself back into shape.", "authors": ["Victor Reklaitis", "Money", "Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS438_congre_ZG_20191001164311.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
