Under Bolton\u2019s guidance at the NSC, combined with that of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the State Department, the Trump administration substantially undermined Iran\u2019s capacity to conduct terror abroad, intervene in foreign wars, and build its military capability. He advanced American interests and values at the United Nations, and he rightly placed strengthening the U.S.-U.K. alliance at the very heart of strategic thinking in the White House. He was also a powerful and effective adversary for Putin\u2019s Russia. Bolton was instrumental in shaping the U.S. response to the Venezuela crisis, pressuring NATO allies to invest more in the common defense, and bringing the U.S.-Taiwan relationship to its strongest standing in four decades.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has shown a determination to stand up to America\u2019s adversaries around the globe, and he is right to focus on preparing the nation to succeed in the era of great power competition. To that end, many of the policies advocated and advanced by Bolton will be key to winning in this burgeoning new era. We should be grateful as a nation for his lifetime of service.\u201d", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The Heritage Foundation's Executive Vice President, Dr. Kim Holmes,\u00a0released the following statement Tuesday about Ambassador John Bolton's public service:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAmbassador Bolton served with distinction as national security adviser, and significantly strengthened the strategic posture and outlook of the United States as the world's superpower.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png"}
