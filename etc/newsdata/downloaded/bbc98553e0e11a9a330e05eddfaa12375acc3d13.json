Quarterback Sam Darnold completed 11 of 32 passes for 86 yards and had four interceptions and a fumble for the Jets (1-5).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good to win,\u201d Patriots coach Bill Belichick told reporters. \u201cI think we\u2019re confident, but we\u2019ll have to start all over again. We emptied the tank tonight. We\u2019ll have to fill it up for next week and be ready to empty it again next week against Cleveland. That\u2019s the way it is every week in this league.\u201d\n\nPatriots quarterback Tom Brady completed 31 of 45 passes for 249 yards, a touchdown and an interception in the win. Running back Sony Michel scored three touchdowns for the Patriots.\n\n\u201cObviously, that was brutal,\u201d Jets coach Adam Gase said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t do anything right. We were bad in all three phases. It was just a bad performance. Can\u2019t play that way against these guys or else you\u2019ll look like that. It\u2019s just not good. We have a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nThis defense is ridiculous. @dharm32 | #GoPats pic.twitter.com/8VtWr6yx3w\u2014 New England Patriots (@Patriots) October 22, 2019\n\nMichel scored his first touchdown on the game\u2019s opening drive. The Patriots star finished off a 16-play, 78-yard possession with a 3-yard rushing score to give the Patriots a 7-0 lead. Devin McCourty intercepted Darnold on the following drive. Mike Nugent then hit a 34-yard field goal to give the Patriots a 10-0 edge. Brady found Phillip Dorsett with a 26-yard touchdown pass on the Patriots\u2019 next drive.\n\nMichel scored on a 1-yard run to give New England a 23-0 lead in the second quarter. The Patriots added a safety in the third quarter before Michel scored for a third time in the fourth frame. Neither team scored points over the final 12:36.\n\nThe Patriots host the Cleveland Browns at 4:25 p.m. EDT Sunday at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass. The Jets face the Jacksonville Jaguars at 1 p.m. EDT Sunday at TIAA Bank Field in Jacksonville.", "description": "Oct. 22 (UPI) \u2014 The New England Patriots moved to 7-0 by shutting out the New York Jets on Monday Night Football.
