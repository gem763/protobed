It is our duty to win. We must love each other and support each other. We have nothing to lose but our chains.\u201d\n\nThis sparked a furious response from New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, who wrote on Twitter : \"There are many inspirational leaders. Assata Shakur is not one of them. To invoke her words is to dishonor the State Trooper she was convicted of murdering.\"\n\n(Image: Bettmann Archive)\n\nMs Shakur, who published an autobiography in exile, which has been a bestseller worldwide, said she had no choice but to flee.\n\nShe wrote: \"Because of government persecution, I was left with no other choice than to flee from the political repression, racism and violence that dominate the US government's policy towards people of color.\n\n\"I am an ex political prisoner and I have been living in exile in Cuba since 1984.\n\n\"I have been a political activist most of my life, and although the U.S. government has done everything in its power to criminalize me, I am not a criminal, nor have I ever been one.\"\n\nThe FBI says differently, writing in an appeal: \"Chesimard and her accomplices opened fire on the troopers.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\"One trooper was wounded and the other was shot and killed execution-style at point-blank range.\n\n\"Chesimard fled the scene, but was subsequently apprehended.\n\n\"One of her accomplices was killed in the shoot-out and the other was also apprehended and remains in jail.\n\n\"In 1977, Chesimard was found guilty of first degree murder, assault and battery of a police officer, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault with intent to kill, illegal possession of a weapon, and armed robbery.\n\n\"She was sentenced to life in prison.\n\n\"On November 2, 1979, Chesimard escaped from prison and lived underground before being located in Cuba in 1984. She is thought to currently still be living in Cuba.\"\n\nThe fugitive is described by the bureau as \"armed and dangerous\".", "description": "In November Assata Shakur, who was convicted of murdering a cop, will have been on the run for 40 years, and she remains a deeply divisive figure", "authors": ["Dave Burke", "Image", "Newsday Rm Via Getty Images", "Bettmann Archive", "Fbi", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20168091.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JoAnn-Chesimard-photographed-in-Cuba.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
