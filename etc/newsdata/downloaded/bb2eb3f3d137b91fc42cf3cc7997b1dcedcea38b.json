Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast gross domestic product to slow to 1.6% from 2% in the second quarter. Consumer spending, the main engine of growth, rose a healthy 2.9%, but it was down from 4.6% in the spring. Businesses investment in structures sank 15% and spending on equipment dropped nearly 4%. Government spending also increased by a smaller 2% compared to 4.8% in the second quarter. In a surprise, inventory levels were barely changed. The change in the value of unsold goods slipped to $69 billion from $69.4 billion. Residential investment also added to GDP with a 5.1% increase - the first in seven quarters. Trade was a slight drag. Exports rose 0.7%, but imports rose a somewhat faster 1.2%. Inflation as measured by the PCE price index rose at a meager 1.5% annual rate, with the core rate up 2.2%.", "description": "WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - The U.S. economy expanded at a mild 1.9% annual pace in the third quarter, decelerating slightly from the spring owing to a...", "authors": ["Jeffry Bartash"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
