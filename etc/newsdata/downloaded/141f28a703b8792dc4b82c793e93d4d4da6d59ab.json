To celebrate, we gathered for a customary champagne toast in lieu of our 9:30 a.m. team standup. By this time, my non-drinker status was well-known amongst the team; I declined my colleague\u2019s offers of post-work drinks, beer from the office fridge. Of course, I\u2019d been peppered with a litany of questions, but had never felt unwelcome. As one of the founders was pouring the bubbly liquid into glasses, I quietly mentioned that I would be passing on the champagne, but could we just pour some water in the toasting glass for me? He was visibly irritated, giving me a disappointed look, and pushing it in front of the small handful of other employees.\n\n\u201cSeriously? You won\u2019t even have this small glass to celebrate with us? This is a huge deal for us.\u201d\n\nHe handed the glass to me. The only thing between me \u2014 a sober alcoholic, terrified of not fitting in \u2014 and my boss \u2014 a man, whom I deeply feared confronting \u2014 was a glass of alcohol.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a tiny drink. To celebrate.\u201d\n\nMy eyes circled the rim. I began to sweat. I could just take the drink. No one outside my colleagues would ever need to know. Surely it would not constitute a relapse. Certainly an exception existed for that kind of situation.\n\nI set the glass back on the counter. A meek rebuttal escaped my lips. \u201cI really never drink. Can I just have water please?\u201d\n\nSnatching the glass off the granite, he rolled his eyes. \u201cFine. Whatever.\u201d\n\nHe ceremoniously dumped my share of the pour down the drain. He refilled the glass with water and pushed it across the counter back at me. Meanwhile, one of my colleagues, an engineer, had stepped up to the counter next to me.\n\n\u201cYeah, I, um, really don\u2019t want to drink right now either. Can I have water too?\u201d\n\nThe founder glared at him, then exploded. \u201cAre you fucking serious? Really?\u201d He raised the glass high above the sink as he dumped the contents. Another engineer piped up, \u201cHey, don\u2019t waste it, I\u2019ll drink it!\u201d The founder replied, \u201cThat\u2019s not the point.\u201d\n\nAs we toasted our glasses and took our ceremonial sips, I swore I could still feel a recognizable sense of warmth as the liquid moved down my throat.\n\nI endured that environment for nine more months until burning out in a full mental collapse.\n\nI knew drinking was a staple of startup culture before I set foot in my first startup event. I had seen #startuplife Tweets about heavy partying following intense periods of overwork, boasts of inebriation at SXSW parties, the rotating craft brew kegs listed on perk pages. I had read various company\u2019s \u201cdrunkalog\u201d posts, recapping their beer pong matches or alcohol-fueled outings. I knew that if I worked at startups I would be around a lot of alcohol. But I had also decided early in my sobriety that if I was going to stay sober, I wouldn\u2019t be staying home waiting for the world to sober up with me. Besides, I regularly attended live music, meeting friends for happy hour, even dancing sober; all in environments built for heavy drinking. By the time I was hired at a startup I had become petrified that if anyone at the company found out that I was an alcoholic, I would be deemed unemployable and unfriendable. My plan was to play it cool when drinking came up at events or in the workplace. I\u2019d wait until disclosure was necessary, and would then say, \u201cNo thank you. I don\u2019t drink.\u201d Not make a big deal of it. But this would prove to rarely quell the inquiry. My abstinence almost always came with follow-ups:\n\n\u201cAre you pregnant?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo like never? Never ever? But what about\u2026\u201d \u201cNo. No. No.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you do for fun?\u201d \u201cLots of stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cI just don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSometimes it worked. Sometimes it didn\u2019t work at all.\n\nAtmy next startup gig, one year later, I decided I would fully disclose my alcoholism with my manager. Being candid about my past, I hoped, would help prevent another uncomfortable situation. The new role required regular travel to socialize with startups, investors, and other tech influencers around the world. I understood that part of my job was to be a good host to clients, which might entail attending events where alcohol was served. But I didn\u2019t have a problem with it: I felt strong in my sobriety and neutral toward alcohol; it simply was not for me. My first international trip was to Argentina, a country I had fantasized about visiting for years. The conference started with a client dinner at a nice steakhouse. We began placing orders for the family style meal, when my boss suddenly announced to the room that I wouldn\u2019t be eating meat. People began to chuckle, saying things like, \u201cHow can you be in Argentina and not try the meat!?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not going to try the beef? You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing!\u201d Then, my boss added, \u201cYeah, she doesn\u2019t drink either. I mean, what the fuck is wrong with her?\u201d Several people laughed alongside my boss.\n\n\u201cThanks for letting us know who\u2019s on asshole duty!\u201d I mustered. I quickly changed the subject, lest our dinner be deemed an awkward failure.\n\nThat evening I struggled to fall asleep, swimming in embarrassment and shame. The excitement around my new position had evaporated. I tried to cultivate compassion for my boss\u2019s comment. Surely it was a momentary lapse in judgement \u2014 maybe he was making up for his own insecurities? I could swear I had seen a tinge of immediate remorse in his eye. ____ I couldn\u2019t help but wonder, had I been naive to believe that others wouldn\u2019t care if I wasn\u2019t drinking?\n\nAfter that trip, my boss and I were never in sync again.\n\nThe first time I poured alcohol into my body seeking escape was on New Years Eve, 2001. The prior year had been a blur. I was in my sophomore year studying in industrial design at the University of Cincinnati when I began experiencing terrible migraines. An MRI revealed I needed brain surgery. It was serious, but not life-threatening, so I decided to have the surgery over Christmas break, planning to jump back into school for second semester. But six weeks after the operation, a new chronic pain set in to my occipital nerves, as well as a debilitating depression. Unable to resume normal life, my parents pulled me out of school and I returned to my childhood home in Cleveland for a miserable existence of shuffling between medical appointments. Almost a full year passed. I recall little of it.\n\nAs the holidays approached I convinced my parents that a trip to Cincinnati to ring in the New Year surrounded by my friends would be good for me. I arrived elated to spend time with them reconnecting, but it quickly felt bittersweet. I couldn\u2019t escape the feeling that things had changed. I had changed. My friends were now a year ahead of me in school. They were looking forward to exciting design co-ops in exotic locations. My outlook remained bleak. There was no plan in place for me to even return to college. I don\u2019t remember what it was I drank that night, because it didn\u2019t matter. I didn\u2019t care. I devoured alcohol with no regard for anything but a feeling: the moment at which everything would stop and the world would melt away. Respite. Relief. Escape.\n\nI chased the feeling I had that New Year\u2019s night for the next seven years. I put it above everything else: family, career, relationships, health. When the first boyfriend I truly loved suggested that marriage could be on the horizon, I sabotaged the relationship. I couldn\u2019t conceive how I would be able to drink the way I wanted locked into that kind of commitment.\n\nI dreamt of building a solid career, but couldn\u2019t muster the energy to start. I went from dead-end administrative job to dead-end administrative job. The longer I drank, the more elusive my desired sensation of relief and escape became, before slipping fully out of reach. Unable to control the amount I drank once I started drinking, I would breeze from sober to blacked out in less than 30 minutes. My life became formulaic: Wake up. Swear I\u2019m never drinking again. Throw up a few times. Choke back a few ibuprofen. Drive to work. Be miserable. Drive to the liquor store. Rush home to drink alone. Oblivion. Lather, rinse, repeat.\n\nYes, I\u2019m an alcoholic. In a way, I was born with it; the disease is hereditary. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m an alcoholic because of things that happened to me, but I do believe that for whatever reason, that New Year\u2019s night flipped the switch for my \u201calcoholic\u201d gene. I no longer had a choice in how much or when I drank. Up until this point, I\u2019ve been highly selective about whom I share this with and when I share, slowly opening up a little more, a little sooner. (If you know me and I\u2019ve never told you, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me. I swear. It\u2019s just that I was afraid.) I\u2019m not ashamed of being an alcoholic. It\u2019s a huge part of the crucible that\u2019s made me, me. It\u2019s etched somewhere deep into my DNA, a part of the building block of who I am. I just always seem to find a reason to let my hesitations win: I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t invite me to the party. Or happy hour. Or team-building wine tasting. Or the ski weekend. Or the party bus. Or SXSW.\n\nAs I dried out, I quickly learned that to maintain my sobriety and feel well, it was necessary for me to take a look at the causes and conditions of why I was willing to regularly poison myself to change the way I felt.\n\nStartups are hard. Really fucking hard. 95% of startups will fail. We work long hours in an attempt to innovate faster, ship products sooner, outrun competitors and preserve limited venture funding. We juggle multiple roles and responsibilities in an effort to keep teams small and nimble. When things go wrong, we pull sleepless nights, perform Herculean support feats and bend over backwards to retain early adopters. We forgo vacations, skip workouts, answer emails on our phones during family time and are expertly skilled at eating lunch while getting shit done. It\u2019s only natural that we would want to find convenient ways to blow off steam, de-stress, or ease fears.\n\nTo be clear, I am not anti-drinking. Plenty of companies, events and organizations use and serve alcohol in a perfectly healthy, adult fashion. What I am uncomfortable with is the prevalence of talk, events, and company cultures seemingly centered around heavy and/or binge drinking.\n\nIt\u2019s buying a keg or having a built-in bar instead of articulating company culture.\n\nIt\u2019s calling a happy hour to make up for a shift in company strategy.\n\nIt\u2019s a drinking-focused group outing \u2014 sailing with champagne, bowling with a beer in hand, an afternoon wine tasting \u2014 to quell feelings of burnout.\n\nIt\u2019s mandating that clients be taken out for a night of drinking to make things right after a glitchy product release.\n\nIt\u2019s the suggestion that a team member should have a drink to relax after sharing that they\u2019re overwhelmed and stressed out.\n\nThe problem is that when alcohol is your solution, you\u2019re playing a dangerous game. It\u2019s not a question of if a heavy drinking culture will result in HR violations or if capable, competent team members will feel ostracized, but when. To say nothing of the lost opportunity to create authentic, honest relationships amongst your team.\n\nAs a non-drinker, I\u2019ve been hesitant to say anything too loudly, too boldly lest someone label me an abolitionist. I\u2019m not. Truly. But the longer I work in startups, the more I hear from those around me that they are uncomfortable, too. I hear concerns from more drinkers than non, and those concerns are becoming more and more frequent. Friends and colleagues who enjoy having a glass of wine or beer from the office fridge mention they are uncomfortable that there are events that feel like getting drunk is a company mandate. If they\u2019re not drinking hard enough, they\u2019re not dedicated. Is it okay not to feel comfortable, or safe, when their colleagues are drunk around them?\n\nI think it\u2019s time for a broad, honest discussion around alcohol and work. So, you tell me: Do startups have a drinking problem? Tell me why or why not. What is the role of alcohol in your work life? Do you or your colleagues turn to alcohol when stressed or burnt out? Do you or your company use alcohol to avoid hard conversations? Do you feel comfortable drinking heavily around your coworkers? How do we support colleagues who struggle with a drinking problem?If you\u2019ve worked at a startup \u2014 or another company with an alcohol-fueled culture \u2014 and have experienced anything like what I shared, tell me about it. And if you disagree with me, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts, too.
