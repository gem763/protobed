But because their abilities and interest in reading at this age can vary like crazy, Leigh Fox, a children\u2019s librarian with the Brooklyn Public Library, \u201chighly encourages\u201d parents and caregivers to continue to read aloud to their 6-year-olds, even as they learn to flip through pages themselves. When reading aloud, Fox suggests incorporating a \u201cvariety of stories and formats,\u201d including longer chapter books, nonfiction, graphic novels, and picture books, \u201cto best excite them about reading and make it a positive experience.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to books the 6-year-old in your life reads on their own, Carly Lemire, head of youth services at Blackstone Library in Branford, Connecticut, recommends using the \u201cfive-finger test\u201d (rather than grade level) to more accurately choose titles that help instill confidence in young readers. Conducting the five-finger test is simple, she explains: \u201cOpen a book to any page and have your 6-year-old read that page. If there are five or more words that they have difficulty with, then that book is a little too hard for them,\u201d in which case you should either pick something a little easier or read it aloud to them until they are ready to read it themselves.\n\nIn terms of subject matter, our experts generally agreed that the best books for any 6-year-old are the ones they love the most \u2014 no matter how silly the story may seem. \u201cAny book that a kid likes to read is one that is going to help make them a lifelong reader,\u201d explains Maggie Levine, a children\u2019s librarian with the Boston Public Library. To help narrow the field, however, we talked to Fox, Lemire, Levine, and five other librarians and educators about their favorite books for 6-year-olds. Read on for their picks, which include books to read together, easy-reader books, early chapter books, and even some of the most popular titles as determined by actual 6-year-olds.\n\nBest books to read to a 6-year-old\n\nDon't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus! by Mo Willems $9 (was $17, now 47% off) Four of the people we talked to \u2014 Lemire; Faith Ward, a middle-school librarian at Baltimore\u2019s Gilman School; Rouhama Garelick, the director of Walder Education; and Emily Levitt, VP of education at Sylvan Learning \u2014 specifically recommend Willems\u2019s picture book about a grumpy pigeon as one to read aloud to a 6-year-old. Levitt loves how the pigeon\u2019s behavior mirrors that of many 6-year-olds, and how the bus-driver character breaks the fourth wall to involve the reader. \u201cI love it for this age because the concept is zany and the story is hilarious. Both parent and child will relate to Pigeon\u2019s pleas to drive the bus. It has all the necessary ingredients for a winning 6-year-old children\u2019s book.\u201d Although only half of our experts chose this specific title, nearly all of them recommended reading something written by Mo Willems aloud, raising this to the top of our read-aloud list. Lindsy Serrano, a librarian at St. Francis School in Kentucky, credits Willems\u2019s use of catchy graphics paired with minimal text in different sizes \u201cto display different emotional levels.\u201d $9 at Amazon Buy $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nAda Twist, Scientist by Andrea Beaty $14 (was $18, now 22% off) Andrea Beaty\u2019s picture book about a burgeoning scientist is the third in her series of best-selling STEM-themed children\u2019s books and, like the Willems title above, also came recommended by four of our experts as a wonderful read-aloud book for any 6-year-old. \u201cAda questions everything and experiments constantly,\u201d says Levitt, who told us she appreciates the book\u2019s \u201cup-close view of the scientific method and excellent representation of children of color engaged in STEM.\u201d Lemire; Brooklyn Public Library librarian Yesha Naik; and Mollie Welsh Kruger, a professor at the Bank Street College of Education who teaches a course in children\u2019s literature, all suggested Ada Twist as well. $14 at Amazon Buy $14 at Amazon Buy\n\nJuli\u00e1n Is a Mermaid by Jessica Love $10 (was $17, now 41% off) Also recommended by four of our experts \u2014 Naik, Ward, Lemire, and Serrano \u2014 is this story about a boy who loves mermaids. Naik loves the book\u2019s \u201cfluid, colorful illustrations,\u201d and Serrano says she uses it during story time because of the way it \u201cdefies male expectations and stereotypes.\u201d $10 at Amazon Buy $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nDog Man: The Epic Collection #1-3 Boxed Set by Dav Pilkey $22 (was $30, now 27% off) For 6-year-olds who are fascinated by anything for older kids, the Dog Man series by Pilkey \u2014 the author of the wildly popular Captain Underpants franchise \u2014 is a great set of books to grow into, according to Lemire, Serrano, Fox, and Lisa Goldstein, another librarian with the Brooklyn Public Library. They all say 6-year-olds love Dog Man because of its big-kid feel and subversive humor. Even though these books are probably a bit too hard for most 6-year-olds to read on their own, graphic novels like these are really popular at this age, according to Serrano, and are generally a fun way to excite young readers. Goldstein agrees, calling the Dog Man books \u201can exciting boundary-pusher for younger kids.\u201d $22 at Amazon Buy $22 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe Book with No Pictures by B.J. Novak $10 (was $18, now 44% off) Another book 6-year-olds find hilarious is The Book With No Pictures, which was written by The Office star turned kids\u2019 author B. J. Novak and came recommended by Levitt and Serrano. Devoid of illustrations and designed to be read aloud or in groups, this book is popular because it\u2019s full of onomatopoeia and alliteration, forcing the person reading it to say silly things. Levitt likes that it teaches vocabulary while encouraging children to use their imaginations. Serrano says that when she reads it at story time, \u201ckids are rolling on the floor laughing.\u201d $10 at Amazon Buy $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nWe Don't Eat Our Classmates by Ryan T. Higgins $11 (was $18, now 39% off) This book, by award-winning author-illustrator Ryan T. Higgins, came recommended by Welsh Kruger and Lemire. We Don\u2019t Eat Our Classmates is also one of the four 2019 winners of the Irma Black Award, an honor determined by an annual vote cast by first- and second-grade children from around the world. Welsh Kruger says that in the past few years, humorous books like this and Novak\u2019s have had \u201ca bit of a winning streak, because kids at that age particularly like humor.\u201d $11 at Amazon Buy $11 at Amazon Buy\n\nGaston by Kelly DiPucchio $11 (was $18, now 39% off) Levine told us that she loves the illustrator Christian Robinson, and that this picture book and DiPucchio\u2019s sequel entitled Antoinette \u2014 both of which feature Robinson\u2019s artwork \u2014 are her favorite books to give as gifts. Serrano also recommends Gaston, which tells the story of a French bulldog and a poodle switched at birth, because it has sparked interesting conversations among her kindergarteners about what makes a family. $11 at Amazon Buy $11 at Amazon Buy\n\nWhere the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak $7 (was $9, now 22% off) Both Ward and Lemire recommend Maurice Sendak\u2019s classic title as one you should still make space for on your 6-year-old\u2019s bookshelf. Ward likes that it shows how children and parents sometimes disagree and how, using his imagination, protagonist Max finds a way to escape when angry. But, in the end, when that anger has passed, he just wants to be back home. $7 at Amazon Buy $7 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest fiction books for a 6-year-old to read\n\nFrog and Toad are Friends by Arnold Lobel $4 (was $7, now 43% off) Fox, Lemire, Levine, and Welsh Kruger all recommend Frog and Toad Are Friends for children starting to read alone. Welsh Kruger told us that this book, and the whole Frog and Toad series, were part of a study that she and a colleague conducted on the best books for early readers. \u201cWe were trying to see what makes early readers worthwhile; in the end, this book seems to have hit the nail on the head.\u201d Levine calls the Frog and Toad series an \u201cabsolute classic\u201d and says that she loves how the gentle adventures play out across several short stories, which helps encourage beginner readers who might feel overwhelmed by longer chapter books. $4 at Amazon Buy $4 at Amazon Buy\n\nWe Are in a Book! (An Elephant and Piggie Book) by Mo Willems $7 (was $10, now 30% off) Another early-reader series that stars a memorable duo is Mo Willems\u2019s Elephant and Piggie books. Fox, Lemire, Serrano, and Levine told us that these books, which have no more than ten words per page, are easy and incredibly popular titles for new readers. Lemire says she can\u2019t keep them on the shelves, and Fox says kids love the \u201cfun-filled antics between the beloved Gerald and Piggie.\u201d Serrano specifically recommended this book from the series because it\u2019s designed to introduce all kinds of good reading habits to kids, including predicting outcomes and the concept of reading a book more than once \u2014 therefore encouraging reading for pleasure. Like Frog and Toad, these familiar, funny characters and their recurring adventures make learning new words less scary to 6-year-olds, according to our experts. $7 at Amazon Buy $7 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest nonfiction book for 6-year-olds to read\n\nActual Size by Steve Jenkins Levine, Welsh Kruger, Fox, and Lemire recommended this title by Steve Jenkins, an author they say is known for his nonfiction children\u2019s books. Fox says Actual Size is the perfect mix of attention-grabbing story and STEM concepts \u201csuch as size comparison and animal behavior,\u201d Levine adds that \u201cJenkins\u2019s books make animals and bodies accessible to kids.\u201d Welsh Kruger recommends this book for animal lovers in particular because of its \u201cbeautiful, ripped-paper collage\u201d illustrations. $8 at Amazon Buy $8 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
