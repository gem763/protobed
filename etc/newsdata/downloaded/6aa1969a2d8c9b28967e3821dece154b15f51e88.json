Announces Enhancements to Credit Facility", "language": "en", "text": "Increased from $189.5 million to $310 million\n\nInterest Rate Reduced by 25 bps\n\nMISSISSAUGA, Ontario, Oct. 30, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- goeasy Ltd. (TSX: GSY), (\u201cgoeasy\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a leading full-service provider of goods and alternative financial services, is pleased to announce that on October 29, 2019 it completed an amendment to its senior secured revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) provided by a syndicate of banks. The amendment increased the maximum principal amount available by $120.5 million in borrowing capacity, increasing the limit from C$189.5 million to C$310 million.\n\nThe interest rate on advances from the Credit Facility was also reduced from the previous rate of Canadian Bankers\u2019 Acceptance rate (\u201cBA\u201d) plus 325 bps to BA plus 300 bps (reduced 25 bps). There was no change to draws where the Company selects the lender\u2019s prime rate (\u201cPrime\u201d) plus 200 bps. Based on the current 90-day BA rate of approximately 2.03% and the current Prime rate of 3.95% as of October 29, 2019, the interest rate on the principal amount drawn would be 5.03% or 5.95% respectively, at the option of the Company. The Company intends to use borrowings under the Credit Facility to expand its consumer loan portfolio.\n\n\u201cThe increase to our credit facility, accompanied by a further reduction in the interest rate, demonstrates the continued confidence our lenders have in the ability to execute on our business strategy,\u201d said Jason Mullins, goeasy\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cWith this amendment, our weighted average interest rate when our facilities are fully drawn reduces from 6.8% to 6.5% and the liquidity to fund our growth plan is extended through to the first quarter of 2021.\u201d\n\nBased on the cash on hand and the borrowing capacity under the Company\u2019s amended revolving credit facility, the Company has approximately $215 million in funding capacity, which will allow it to achieve its targets for the growth of its consumer loan portfolio through to the first quarter of 2021. The Company has historically been able to obtain the additional financing required to fund the growth of its business at steadily lower costs of borrowing and increasing rates of leverage. However, the Company also estimates that once its existing and available sources of capital are fully utilized, the Company can continue to grow its loan portfolio by approximately $150 million per year solely from internal cash flows.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nAll figures reported above with respect to outlook are targets established by the Company and are subject to change as plans and business conditions vary. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the foregoing guidance. Actual results may differ materially.\n\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements about goeasy, including, but not limited to, its business operations, strategy, expected financial performance and condition, the estimated number of new locations to be opened, targets for growth of the consumer loans receivable portfolio, annual revenue growth targets, strategic initiatives, new product offerings and new delivery channels, anticipated cost savings, planned capital expenditures, anticipated capital requirements, liquidity of the Company, plans and references to future operations and results and critical accounting estimates.
