But a former top U.S. envoy to Ukraine has said the DOJ never actually asked the White House for that help.\n\nMulvaney has since tried to walk back his claim, saying the administration only held up military aid to Ukraine because of the country\u2019s corruption and because other countries weren\u2019t giving more aid as well. But the fact that his initial version of events differed so far from the testimony of another main player in the Ukraine saga highlights the White House\u2019s struggle to defend itself.\n\nDuring his congressional deposition earlier this month, former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker said that the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Justice never officially asked Ukrainian law enforcement for help probing 2016 election interference or the company where Hunter Biden was a board member, according to sources familiar with what Volker said. Trump himself asked Ukraine\u2019s president to scrutinize that company, Burisma, according to a memorandum of their conversation. But Volker has said that to his knowledge the Justice Department never officially made its own ask.\n\nA DOJ spokesperson and a lawyer for Volker both declined to comment for this story.\n\nVolker said the topics of Burisma and election interference came up as he, Rudy Giuliani, and European Union Amb. Gordon Sondland worked with a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on a statement about U.S.-Ukraine relations. Zelensky wanted to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House after having recently been inaugurated, and Volker and Sondland also wanted Trump and Zelensky to meet. But Giuliani\u2013\u2013Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and close outside advisor\u2013\u2013said the Ukrainians should first release a public statement on corruption. And he wanted it to mention two things: alleged Ukraine meddling in the 2016 election and Burisma.\n\nThe Zelensky aide, Andrey Yermak, wanted to know if the U.S. Justice Department had officially asked Ukraine for help on those two matters. Volker told Congress that he reached out to Bruce Swartz, a senior DOJ official who deals with international issues, but that he didn\u2019t hear back. He said that he was later told that DOJ made no such official request.\n\nThe Ukrainians and Volker ultimately agreed that it was best not to release a statement, in part because the DOJ hadn\u2019t officially asked them for help on 2016 interference or Burisma. Volker has said that, at the time, he was not aware that Trump had directly asked Zelensky about the Bidens.\n\nThe narrative of events appears to counter Mulvaney\u2019s Thursday press conference, during which the acting chief of staff said that the administration temporarily withheld military aid from the Ukrainians for three reasons.\n\n\u201cThree issues for that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe corruption in the country, whether or not other countries were participating in the support of the Ukraine, and whether or not they were cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our Department of Justice. That\u2019s completely legitimate.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department pushed back against Mulvaney\u2019s comments shortly after his press conference on Thursday. \u201cIf the White House was withholding aid in regards to the cooperation of any investigation at the Department of Justice, that\u2019s news to us,\u201d one senior DOJ official told reporters.\n\nAnd on Sunday, Mulvaney insisted he never actually said there were three issues for holding up aid. \u201cAgain, that\u2019s not what I said, that's what people said I said,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201c Here\u2019s what I said\u2026 there were two reasons that we held up the aid.\u201d\n\nVolker\u2019s testimony is consistent with the DOJ statement, and goes further\u2013\u2013indicating that, as far as one of America\u2019s top envoys to Ukraine knew, the Justice Department under the Trump administration never officially asked the Ukrainians for help probing Burisma and 2016 election interference.\n\nBut while DOJ may not have made the ask, the president himself certainly did. On their July 25 phone call, Trump pushed Zelensky to talk with Giuliani about the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had scrutinized Burisma.\n\n\u201cI will ask him [Giuliani] to call you along with the Attorney General,\u201d Trump told Zelensky, according to the White House\u2019s memo on their call.\n\n\u201cI will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it,\u201d Trump added.\n\nVolker has maintained that he did not know Trump offered to have Barr and Giuliani call Zelensky until the public knew. If Volker\u2019s understanding of the issue is accurate, then the DOJ did not officially follow up with Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Justice regarding Burisma and 2016. According to The Wall Street Journal, the DOJ has said Trump didn\u2019t ask Barr to reach out to Kyiv\u2013\u2013despite telling Zelensky he would do so.", "description": "Kurt Volker told Congress that DOJ never asked Ukraine to scrutinize election interference.
