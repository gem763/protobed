In his keynote address, ScoMo said that he wants to see more women running for parliament in the next federal election, which will likely be held in 2022.\n\nWomen only made up 23% of the Liberal\u2019s lower house MPs and Senators as of the 2019 federal election. In contrast, the Labor party displayed a 47% female representation at the same time, according to the ABC. Women also outnumbered men in the Senate for the Labour party.\n\nScoMo called upon the NSW representatives to work with him to increase the amount of women running for federal positions.\n\n\u201cI want to see at the next election more women in our parliament, and I want to see the NSW division work with me and my team to deliver that \u2014 on merit, that\u2019s the key,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to deliver it. No point in having targets when you don\u2019t have a plan to meet them. We\u2019ve got a target for growing jobs in this country. But we\u2019ve also got a plan in creating those jobs.\u201d\n\nHe also pointed out that it\u2019s not his job to actually achieve this, likely to avoid any responsibility if it doesn\u2019t actually happen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for me or my parliamentary colleagues or (Premier) Gladys (Berejiklian) and her parliamentary colleagues to be telling you, the members of the NSW division, how those issues should run in terms of how you should select candidates \u2014 that\u2019s up to you \u2014 but we need to lift that representation and that\u2019s your job.\u201d\n\nScott Morrison, who last week lost his marbles over a gender inclusive sign on a bathroom door, has suddenly decided care about womens equality.\n\nAt an International Women\u2019s Day address in Perth earlier this year, ScoMo made it clear that he doesn\u2019t understand what feminism actually is, suggesting that women can only get ahead at the expense of men.\n\n\u201cWe want to see women rise. But we don\u2019t want to see women rise only on the basis of others doing worse,\u201d he said in the address, despite the fact that feminism is trying to achieve equality, not superiority.\n\nSo basically, he wants more women in parliament, but not if they\u2019re taking opportunities from men.\n\nIn his address in Sydney on Saturday, Scott Morrison said it wasn\u2019t his job to tell NSW members how to increase female representation, only that it needs to be done. So, you know, make it happen.\n\nIs this the part where Scott Morrison starts to do something good for the nation? Or is it simply another big show to make it look like Scott Morrison cares about something other than signs on toilet doors? Who knows?\n\nScott Morrison surprisingly won the recent federal election in May this year, and isn\u2019t expected to face the polls again until 2022.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/20190907001417599285-original-1024x683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
