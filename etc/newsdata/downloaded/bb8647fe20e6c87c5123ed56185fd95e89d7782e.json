And the revelation of a second whistleblower with first-hand knowledge could further undermine the Trump administration's efforts to discredit the complaint.\n\nRead more: Newly revealed text messages show Trump diplomats' internal turmoil over his pressure on Ukraine\n\nThe New York Times on Friday reported a second intelligence official with concerns about Trump's interactions with Ukraine was also considering filing a formal complaint and testifying to Congress, but Zaid told ABC News he doesn't know if the second whistleblower he represents is the person identified in this report.\n\nThis news also came just several days after US House Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, and Foreign Affairs Committees released a pile of text messages between US diplomats \u2014 obtained as part of the impeachment inquiry \u2014 that point to a broad effort to urge Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. The messages included discussions of military aid and the possibility of a meeting between Trump and Zelensky, and questions on whether these things were conditioned on investigations in the former vice president and his son.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint that has spared the impeachment inquiry alleges Trump used the power of his office to \"solicit interference from a foreign country\" in the 2020 US election.\n\nTrump ordered his administration to withhold a nearly $400 million military-aid package to Ukraine days before the phone call with Zelensky, and combined with the complaint, the White House memo on the call, and the text messages this has raised questions about the possibility of a quid pro quo among the president's critics. Trump has denied there was any quid pro quo linked to his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden, a top political rival and leading contender for the 2020 Democratic nomination.", "description": "Attorney Mark Zaid says he is now representing both the first whistleblower who sparked the Trump impeachment inquiry and the second whistleblower.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d99f6c20977cd26bd0b8b89?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
