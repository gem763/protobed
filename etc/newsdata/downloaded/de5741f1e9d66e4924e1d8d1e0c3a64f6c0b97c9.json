This could go two ways: Very boring or totally batty.\n\nThe last time there was a schedule like this was 23 months ago and the result was the latter. Seven ranked teams lost to unranked teams, six playing on the road and three that were favored by at least two touchdowns.\n\nThe craziness started on Oct. 13, 2017 - a Friday the 13th, just like this week - when Syracuse beat No. 2 Clemson 27-24 at the Carrier Dome. Later that night, No. 8 Washington State was blown out at California, 37-3.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe beat went on the next day, though not all could be considered upsets. No. 24 Texas Tech and No. 25 Navy lost road games and were never ranked again that season.\n\nSome of the results had serious postseason implications. No. 10 Auburn lost at LSU and then did not lose again until the SEC championship.

The Tigers are favored by four touchdowns, one of four top-six teams favored by at least two touchdowns on the road this weekend.\n\nThe picks (FBS-FCS matchups not included):\n\nFRIDAY\n\nNo. 20 Washington State (minus 9) at Houston\n\nThe Cougars playing a Friday night road game.
