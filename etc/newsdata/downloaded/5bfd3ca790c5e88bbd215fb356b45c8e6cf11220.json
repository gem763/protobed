REUTERS/Eric Thayer\n\nPresident Donald Trump said the United States was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to hit back after Saturday\u2019s attack, which knocked out more than half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production and damaged the world\u2019s biggest crude processing plant.\n\nIran denied U.S. accusations it was to blame and said it was ready for \u201cfull-fledged war.\u201d\n\nU.S. lawmakers, especially Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, were quick to blame Tehran.\n\nMitch McConnell, the Senate\u2019s Republican majority leader, called it \u201ca brazen attack\u201d with significant implications for the global energy market and said he welcomed Trump\u2019s preparation to potentially release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to stabilize markets if necessary.\n\n\u201cI hope our international partners will join us in imposing consequences on Iran for this reckless destabilizing attack,\u201d McConnell said as he opened the Senate.\n\nMany lawmakers stressed that Congress, not the president, has the right to declare war and warned against any quick military action.\n\nCongress, with backing from both Republicans and Democrats, has passed - but Trump has vetoed - four bills seeking to push back against Trump\u2019s strong support for the Saudi government, despite its human rights record and steep civilian casualties in the war in Yemen.\n\nSenate aides said the administration was expected to begin providing classified briefings on Saturday\u2019s attack for congressional staff and members as soon as Monday.\n\nSenator Chris Murphy, a Democrat who is on the Senate Foreign Relations committee, noted that the United States has long been wary of getting involved in conflicts between nations in the Middle East. He noted that Washington does not have a defense treaty with Riyadh.\n\n\u201cWhy should the United States get dragged into a conflict that has more to do with Saudi and Iranian power in the Middle East than American power?\u201d Murphy, a critic of Saudi Arabia on rights issues including its role in the Yemen war, told Reuters.\n\nSenator Jim Risch, the Republican chairman of the foreign relations panel, warned of U.S. retaliation in case of an attack on U.S. troops.\n\n\u201cIran should not underestimate the United States\u2019 resolve,\u201d he said. \u201cAny attack against U.S. forces deployed abroad must be met with an overwhelming response - no targets are off the table.\u201d\n\nRepublican Senator Rand Paul, another foreign relations committee member, said on CNN that any attack on Iran would constitute a \u201cneedless escalation\u201d of war.", "description": "Members of the U.S. Congress blasted Iran after the attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, but expressed wariness about U.S. military action, especially before they have a clearer picture of who was behind it.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430578738&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1LK", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
