Obama\u2019s action, along with a heroic intervention by Kurdish fighters, saved tens of thousands of Yazidi lives.\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\n\u201cWhile America has never been able to right every wrong, America has made the world a more secure and prosperous place,\u201d Obama declared at the time. \u201cAnd our leadership is necessary to underwrite the global security and prosperity that our children and our grandchildren will depend upon.\u201d\n\n\n\nContrast Obama\u2019s move, successfully working with allies to avert a genocide, with President Trump\u2019s betrayal this month of those same Kurdish partners in a way that handed a victory to the Islamic State, Turkey, Syria, Iran \u2014 and, of course, Russia, because almost everything Trump does seems to end up benefiting Moscow.\n\n\u201cWho can trust Trump\u2019s America?\u201d The Economist magazine asks on its newest cover. Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, added: \u201cWhat we have done to the Kurds will stand as a bloodstain in the annals of American history.\u201d\n\nTrump doubled down by saying that the Kurds were \u201cno angels\u201d and compared the fighting in Syria that he unleashed \u2014 with hundreds dead and 300,000 displaced \u2014 to a couple of kids fighting in a vacant lot. His own former special envoy, Brett McGurk, responded on Twitter: \u201cThis is an obscene and ignorant statement.\u201d\n\nGiven the Kurdish heroism in arresting genocide against the Yazidi in 2014, it is savagely ironic that Trump\u2019s betrayal has now put the Kurds themselves at risk of war crimes and ethnic cleansing by Turkey. Gunmen backed by Turkey dragged a female Kurdish politician, Hevrin Khalaf, from her car by her hair, beat her and broke her legs, facial bones and skull, and then shot her dead. When a friend called her phone afterward, a man answered and said, \u201cYou Kurds are traitors,\u201d according to Amnesty International, which also said Turkish military forces and a coalition of Turkey-backed Syrian armed groups have carried out war crimes.\n\nThere also are reports of Turkish-backed forces using white phosphorus or napalm on civilians, and that\u2019s after the supposed cease-fire that Vice President Mike Pence claimed to have reached with Turkey. It\u2019s nauseating to hear Trump claim that this cave-in represents \u201ca great day for civilization\u201d and that \u201cmillions of lives will be saved.\u201d\n\nA former United Nations official emailed me, aghast, to compare the deal to the 1938 Munich Agreement \u201cpeace for our time.\u201d He added that even Neville Chamberlain never agreed to help move the Czechs out of Sudetenland.\n\nTrump has emphasized his desire to bring American troops home, and that\u2019s a perfectly reasonable aspiration if undertaken in a prudent way. But even as Trump abandoned the Kurds and unleashed this disaster, he was actually increasing the number of American soldiers in the Middle East \u2014 sending some 3,000 additional troops to Saudi Arabia.\n\nSo we\u2019re sending more troops to Saudi Arabia to help a misogynist dictatorship that kills a journalist for an American newspaper, even as we betray the Kurds who have been trying to build a democratic enclave that empowers women; we\u2019re sending troops to Saudi Arabia to confront Iran, even as we give Iran a helping hand in Syria.\n\nThis is where incoherence and inhumanity converge.\n\n\u201cForeign policy is what I\u2019ll be remembered for,\u201d Trump boasted in 2017 to my colleague David E. Sanger. Well, um, yes.\n\nBy failing to prepare for a phone call with Turkey\u2019s leader, and then allowing himself to be manipulated, Trump undid years of work in the Middle East. But he also is corroding the entire 75-year-old American postwar international order, built on American credibility and values. Everyone knew that the United States did not always live up to its rhetoric but also that its ideals and commitments counted for something. Until now.\n\nI began this column with a note of praise for Obama for confronting the Yazidi genocide and saving many lives. It\u2019s also true that Syria was Obama\u2019s greatest foreign policy failure, and I repeatedly criticized his passivity as hundreds of thousands were killed.\n\nYet at least Obama was always wrestling deeply with the issues, seeking out expert opinions and trying to make the most informed decisions possible. While I questioned his judgment on Syria, I never doubted his seriousness, compassion or integrity.\n\nTrump in contrast is callow, reckless and indifferent. What he has done in Syria is not foreign policy. It is vandalism.\n\n...\n\nEvery December I publish a \u201choliday gift guide\u201d column that offers ideas for readers looking to contribute to great causes, and now there\u2019s an exciting twist: One reader has committed $1 million for a $100,000 award to my top charity for each of the next 10 years.
