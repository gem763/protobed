Trump has stopped pretending to care | Mohamad Bazzi", "language": "en", "text": "A year after Saudi agents murdered the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Donald Trump\u2019s administration is eager to rehabilitate the reputation of the kingdom\u2019s brutal crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. This week, Steven Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary, and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, will attend a lavish investment conference in the Saudi capital intended to burnish the prince\u2019s image as a reformer.\n\nThe conference, nicknamed \u201cDavos in the desert\u201d, is expected to draw dozens of US and western business executives who stayed away from last year\u2019s gathering, which took place only weeks after Khashoggi\u2019s assassination inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Last year the CIA concluded, with \u201chigh confidence\u201d, that Prince Mohammed had ordered the killing of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and US resident.\n\nBut today, the Trump administration and Wall Street executives are sending a clear message: Saudi Arabia is open for business, and US firms don\u2019t want to miss out on billions of dollars being dangled by Saudi leaders. They\u2019re hoping that the international outrage over Khashoggi\u2019s murder and the kingdom\u2019s human rights record has died down, and that there won\u2019t be a political cost to attending the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh.\n\nMnuchin and Kushner are scheduled to take part in panel discussions during the three day conference, which runs from 29 to 31 October. Top executives from JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Blackstone and other financial firms will also attend.\n\nAftershocks from Jamal Khashoggi's murder still shake the Middle East Read more\n\nPrince Mohammed and his advisers have been wooing these banks with the prospect of underwriting the world\u2019s largest initial public offering. The prince has promised to sell a portion of the state-owned oil monopoly, Saudi Aramco. US and European bankers could earn fortunes in fees.\n\nAfter Khashoggi\u2019s murder, US and European firms did not stop doing business with Saudi Arabia, though many kept a low profile. But Trump and members of his administration \u2013 especially Kushner, who became friends with Prince Mohammed soon after Trump took office \u2013 never wavered in their support for the Saudi regime. Trump\u2019s support signaled to other world leaders and business executives that they could continue working with Saudi Arabia, albeit quietly. Mnuchin withdrew from last year\u2019s summit; this year the Trump administration has dropped even the pretense of protest.\n\nWhen he toured the US in the spring of 2018, Prince Mohammed was treated like a rock star. The prince met Silicon Valley titans, Wall Street financiers and Hollywood royalty on a three-week, cross-country tour. He was celebrated as a reformer committed to modernizing the repressive kingdom.\n\nBut the prince\u2019s record was always clear. After his father\u2019s ascension as king in 2015, Prince Mohammed consolidated power, removing his rivals and extending unprecedented control over the security establishment. He launched a disastrous war against Houthi rebels in Yemen and cracked down on internal dissent. Yet politicians and business executives in the west continued to praise the young prince. They were eager for investments from the kingdom\u2019s $320bn sovereign wealth fund, which Prince Mohammed controls.\n\nWhether from naivety or self-interest, the western political class often mistakes a leader\u2019s interest in technology and entrepreneurship as support for political reform. But as Prince Mohammed has shown, a leader can invest billions of dollars in Uber and still maintain a police state.\n\nSince he rose to power, Prince Mohammed has presided over a series of destructive policies that destabilized the Middle East. The Saudi-led war in Yemen has killed tens of thousands of civilians; instigated the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis; and implicated the United States, Britain and France in likely war crimes. The kingdom has imposed a blockade against its smaller neighbor, Qatar; and the prince ordered the arrests of hundreds of activists and political opponents. Those internal dissidents have received far less attention because they\u2019re not as well known or connected as Khashoggi.\n\nDespite the prince\u2019s dismal record, US business executives still couch their dealings with Saudi Arabia as an attempt to promote reform. Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, pulled out of last year\u2019s conference after Khashoggi\u2019s murder. But he attended another conference in Saudi Arabia in April; his firm recently opened an office there; and he plans to attend this week\u2019s summit.\n\n\u201cThe murder of Jamal Khashoggi was horrifying,\u201d Fink wrote on LinkedIn in April. He argued that \u201ccorporate engagement and public dialogue\u201d could help the kingdom undertake reform. \u201cAs I have said repeatedly to Saudi leaders, for Saudi Arabia to be on the world stage, it must act like a world leader.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s naive and hypocritical of business executives to think that the presence of foreign companies will change Prince Mohammed\u2019s regime. The prince and his advisers have made it clear that they can withstand international condemnation as long as they have leverage over those who do business with Saudi Arabia.\n\nAt least Trump doesn\u2019t bother with niceties about reform and rule of law. Last October, Trump was asked whether he would cancel billions of dollars in weapons sales to Saudi Arabia if its leaders were implicated in Khashoggi\u2019s murder. The president responded: \u201cWe don\u2019t like it even a little bit. But whether or not we should stop $110bn from being spent in this country \u2026 That would not be acceptable to me.\u201d\n\nTrump dropped any pretext that the US-Saudi alliance is more than a transactional relationship based on maintaining weapons deals, stable oil prices and regional security interests. After all: why would he isolate the reckless crown prince \u2013 and lose sales to America\u2019s largest weapons buyer?", "description": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s dismal record isn\u2019t deterring Mnuchin, Kushner and a flock of executives from attending \u2018Davos in the desert\u2019", "authors": ["Mohamad Bazzi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f468605e5bb22b3099e7ee86de9461626daf79c4/0_382_4826_2896/master/4826.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3b847c853801c46b0d97c0d7ae64d504", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
