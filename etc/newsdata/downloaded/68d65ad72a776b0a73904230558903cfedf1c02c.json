REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nTariff-vulnerable industrials helped keep the blue chip Dow in positive territory, which was on track for its eighth straight daily advance, its longest winning streak since May 2018.\n\nAll three major U.S. stock indexes looked set to post their third straight weekly gains, capping a week that saw signs of a potential thaw in the trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies that has gripped markets for months.\n\nApple Inc (AAPL.O) was the biggest drag on the major stock averages, dropping 1.8% after Goldman Sachs cut its price target for the iPhone maker\u2019s shares.\n\nBeijing announced it would exempt some U.S. agricultural products from additional tariffs after President Donald Trump suggested he could be open to an interim deal, the latest in a series of conciliatory gestures by both sides of the trade war ahead of next month\u2019s negotiations in Washington.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had these small concessions back and forth, which at minimum gives investors some confidence that things are moving in the right direction,\u201d said Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint in Atlanta. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Chinese are going to roll over on trade but they recognize there is a mutual benefit to keep the U.S. from escalating the trade war.\u201d\n\nOn the economic front, U.S. retail sales increased in August at twice the rate analysts expected, according the Commerce Department, suggesting that strong consumer spending will continue to support the longest-ever U.S. economic expansion.\n\nEbbing trade jitters and upbeat retail sales data helped U.S. Treasury yields reach multi-week highs.\n\n\u201cInvestors will reevaluate their appetite for equities at the next big catalyst event, which will be the Fed meeting,\u201d Sroka added.\n\nIndeed, the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points at the conclusion of its monetary policy meeting next week.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 56.58 points, or 0.21%, to 27,239.03, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 1.06 points, or 0.04%, to 3,008.51 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 16.24 points, or 0.2%, to 8,178.23.\n\nOf the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, seven were in the red, with real estate .SPLRCR suffering the largest percentage loss.\n\nMaterials .SPLRCM and financial .SPSY stocks were the biggest gainers, up 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively.\n\nChipmaker Broadcom Inc (AVGO.O) slipped 2.5% after the company missed quarterly revenue estimates late Thursday and said that while semiconductor demand has likely hit bottom, the timing of a recovery remains uncertain.\n\nProgressive Corp (PGR.N) fell 5.3% after the insurer reported a 36% year-on-year drop in August net income.\n\nLumber Liquidators Holdings Inc (LL.N) plunged 12.1% after founder Thomas Sullivan told Bloomberg he was holding off on plans to take the company private.\n\nTyson Foods Inc (TSN.N), the largest U.S. meat processor, advanced 2.3% on China\u2019s tariff exemption announcement.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.38-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 19 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 77 new highs and 19 new lows.", "description": "Wall Street was mixed on Friday, with the S&P 500 and the Dow hovering just below all-time highs as cautious optimism regarding easing U.S.-China trade tensions was held in check by a drop in Apple stock.", "authors": ["Stephen Culp", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429453101&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C10Z", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
