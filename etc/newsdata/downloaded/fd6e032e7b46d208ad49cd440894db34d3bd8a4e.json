Most of those gathered wore face masks to shield their identity because of concerns about official retaliation. Secondary schools in Hong Kong were also planning a mass class boycott in response to the shooting.\n\nPlay Video 1:44 Hong Kong protester shot as China National Day demonstrations intensify \u2013 video\n\nOther protesters gathered on Wednesday at a courtroom West Kowloon, where 96 people arrested at the weekend were expected to be charged with rioting. It will be the largest mass hearing in the city since the handover from British colonial rule, according to writer and activist Kong Tsung-gan.\n\nA previous court hearing in July for 44 people arrested during protests that month sparked fresh stand-offs with police outside the courtroom.\n\nThe lobby of the courtroom was crammed with relatives and supporters lining up for tickets, many also wearing face masks to shield their identity. The courtroom has only 100 spaces, far too few for the gathering crowds.\n\nA mother of one young detainee said she had only seen him at a distance in hospital since he was arrested, because he was receiving treatment for shoulder and arm injuries. She added that she believed all the defendants were facing the same charge of rioting.\n\nHong Kong protesters rain on China\u2019s anniversary parade Read more\n\nOn Wednesday the city was still reeling from the worst political violence it has seen since a controversial extradition bill first sparked protests in early June.\n\nPolice had refused a permit to organisers of \u201cday of grief\u201d protests, called to mark the 70th anniversary of communist rule in China, but people defied the official ban to turn out in their thousands for gatherings across the city.\n\nMarches that began peacefully had slipped by mid-afternoon into raging battles between protestors and police who deployed tear gas, water cannons and ultimately six rounds of live ammunition.\n\nAt least 66 people were injured, four of them seriously, and over 180 people arrested, police said. The demonstrations also paralysed much of the city, forcing the shut down of nearly half its metro stations as authorities tried to prevent larger crowds reaching protest sites.\n\nThe chaotic scenes over-shadowed a carefully-choreographed military parade and evening gala meant to celebrate China\u2019s rise to global super-power status, and showcase the rule of strongman president Xi Jinping.\n\nThe shooting of Tsang caused particular outrage in Hong Kong and around the world, with the UK calling the use of live ammunition \u201cdisproportionate\u201d and Amnesty International calling for an urgent independent investigation.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Students stand outside the Tsuen Wan Public Ho Chuen Yiu Memorial College during a demonstration held to show solidarity with the injured student in Hong Kong Photograph: J\u00e9r\u00f4me Favre/EPA\n\nPolice said the officer feared for his life on a day that saw his colleagues fire five warning shots from their pistols throughout the city.\n\nBut protest groups hit back, saying the officer charged into the melee with his firearm drawn, and condemned the increasing use of live rounds.\n\n\u201cHK (has) fallen into a de facto police state,\u201d prominent democracy activist Joshua Wong tweeted. \u201cThe paramilitary security forces completely took over this city.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Hong Kong police have gone trigger-happy and nuts,\u201d pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo said.\n\nA friend and classmate among the crowds demonstrating at his school, who gave his first name Marco, said the 18-year-old victim was a keen basketballer who was infuriated by sliding freedoms in Hong Kong and the police response to the protests.\n\nABC News (@ABC) Students protest outside school of 18-year-old protester shot in chest by police in Hong Kong. https://t.co/LuMREgMvOG pic.twitter.com/qdoc4o37Ns\n\n\u201cIf he sees any problems or anything unjust, he would face it bravely, speak up against it, instead of bearing it silently,\u201d Marco told AFP.\n\nOn Wednesday morning Tsang was in a critical but stable condition after surgery to remove the bullet, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nLeaked scans showed it had \u201cbarely missed the heart\u201d but Tsang now had relatively good hopes of recovery, medical sources told the paper. \u201cGiven his age and good general condition, there is a good chance that he will survive.\u201d\n\nPolice have arrested Tsang for assaulting a police officer, and said the use of a fire arm was \u201clawful and reasonable\u201d, with the officer who fired trying to protect another policeman who was being attacked by protestors.\n\nTwenty four opposition lawmakers strongly condemned police for \u201cunnecessarily escalating the use of force\u201d, in a joint statement. \u201cThe policeman\u2019s close-range shooting seems to be an attack rather than self-defence.\u201d it said.\n\nVideo footage of the incident showed the officer run towards the group with his pistol drawn, even though he was also armed with pepper spray and a gun that fires non-lethal beanbag rounds.\n\n", "description": "Class boycotts held after 18-year-old hit with live ammunition, as dozens of protesters face court charged with rioting", "authors": ["Emma Graham-Harrison"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19e72931019397797a92ac2671ff3dfc4a65e851/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=db5f91988efb579dedd9c6ca52702e99"}
