More than 9,000 restaurant meals on the job can take their toll on a critic. A current (and honest) rendering would reveal an extra chin and a fuller suit.\n\nNot that I\u2019m complaining. Everyone should be so lucky to be paid to pursue their passion. My great fortune over two decades has been to document the Washington dining scene for a discerning audience \u2014 to chew and tell, so to speak.\n\nBesides, time flies when you\u2019re having pho \u2026 and lamb vindaloo, baby goat, steamed mussels, Peking duck, doro wat, chicken peri-peri, a daiquiri animated with Pop Rocks, pasta tinted with squid ink, \u201cbreakfast for dinner,\u201d vegetable charcuterie, 100-day-old kimchi and more dishes of whole fish and grilled meat than I can count.\n\nSpeaking of steak, my debut review put me at the Prime Rib on K Street. The restaurant was far from new even then, but it occupied a place along a power corridor and served something I figured a lot of readers could relate to, in a dining room so formal it kept a closet of coats and ties for gentlemen who didn\u2019t know better. Back then, patrons sought out steakhouses, or looked to French or Italian restaurants, to mark special occasions.\n\nNow, I\u2019d no more launch a column with one of those flavors than wear skinny jeans. As a world capital, Washington has always offered dozens of cuisines, but only recently have the non-European examples risen to broad prominence. A younger me would have raised an eyebrow at the idea that people would stand in line, sometimes for hours, for northern Thai food in a basement (Little Serow, introduced in 2011) or even an American restaurant where the signature is a bowl of pork, litchis and chiles (Rose\u2019s Luxury, opened in 2013).\n\nBut a younger me also worked in a different Washington. Dupont Circle, Georgetown and later Penn Quarter hosted many of the best tables. The idea of \u201cdowntown\u201d dining pretty much stopped with the seafood-themed DC Coast at 14th and K streets. (There were exceptions, including Rupperts, a trendy taste of Berkeley on Seventh Street NW.) Toward the end of 2000, the game changed markedly with the arrival of a sprawling Fresh Fields (now Whole Foods Market) in Logan Circle. Once known for bulletproof windows and greasy carryouts, the neighborhood gained instant cachet. \u201cWith the cars double-parked outside,\u201d wrote Anne Hull in The Washington Post a year later, \u201cit became apparent there was a new drug on P Street. It was called food.\u201d\n\nThe Brooklyn cake from Brothers and Sisters (Laura Chase de Formigny; food styling and production by Jennifer Beeson Gregory).\n\nBack then, the leaders of the chef pack were mostly white men with some age on them: O\u2019Connell in the hinterland and Jeff Buben (Vidalia), Roberto Donna (Galileo), Bob Kinkead (Kinkead\u2019s) and Michel Richard (Citronelle) in the District. \u201cIf one wanted to become a chef,\u201d says Amy Brandwein, a protege of Donna\u2019s who went on to open the beloved Centrolina in 2015, \u201cthose were the restaurants you went to work for. Nowhere else.\u201d\n\nThe headliners these days are apt to be younger people of color and women: Kwame Onwuachi, Erik Bruner-Yang and Marjorie Meek-Bradley, among others. Motivated at least for a time by agreeable rents and a desire to cook where customers actually live, a new generation of chefs and restaurants has turned Shaw and H Street NE into dining meccas. More recently, the Navy Yard and the Wharf have added to the area\u2019s embarrassment of restaurant riches \u2014 and rooms with views.\n\nDining out is a bigger sport than ever. Last year, consumers spent an estimated $4.4 billion in the District alone, according to the Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington. That\u2019s almost double the amount from 2006, the last time I referenced local food and drink sales.\n\nThe sport has gotten more expensive, but affluent and well-educated Washington diners are willing to pay the price. \u201cIs okra the new truffle?\u201d Eric Ziebold wondered in a recent email to me. The chef at Kinship and M\u00e9tier had just seen the vegetable selling for almost $7 a pound at a farmers market. The gist: Diners are willing to pay for their choices. \u201cThey do want better products, they do want to eat more responsibly, and they do have the means to pay for it,\u201d he wrote.\n\nD.C.\u2019s Iron Gate reopened in 2014 with, from left, pastry cook Whitney Schwanda, sous-chef Jim Diecchio, executive chef Tony Chittum and sous-chef Seth Wells. (Scott Suchman)\n\nSince my maiden dining guide, in which I told readers where I spent my own money (and got lambasted by some for the $19,000 I dropped that year), we\u2019ve come a long way, baby. Flipping through fall roundups past felt like perusing a memory book. Here I am in 2004, talking about chef-to-watch Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, improved bread baskets and neighborhood spots offering amuse-bouches \u2014 a fine-dining accent \u2014 but also complaining about the plight of vegetarians. Three years later saw me describing spinoffs from prominent chefs, street corners peddling more than hot dogs, and Logan Circle and the Atlas District as dining destinations. On my 10th anniversary as food critic, the news included an uptick in female sommeliers, farmers being hailed as heroes, destination suburban restaurants and celebrity chefs lured to open outposts in Washington.\n\nVeteran tastemakers point to a couple of pivotal factors in the past 20 years. One was the 2008 recession, which hit fine-dining establishments especially hard. Seemingly overnight, linens and flowers got 86\u2019d. We\u2019ve been eating differently ever since. Take lunch. When\u2019s the last time you actually reserved an afternoon table anywhere? A fleet of food trucks and a small army of homegrown, fast-casual operators, among them Cava and Sweetgreen, diverted our attention and budgets away from seated, multicourse lunches.\n\nEqually profound was the widespread reliance on the Internet, followed by social media, which changed the game for diners, chefs and critics alike.\n\nThe paying public could get a taste of a place before it stepped inside. All they had to do was click on a restaurant\u2019s website or scroll through a Yelp review. Ziebold recalls returning to Washington from California in 2004 and hearing good things about Ethiopian food. He enlisted staff from that part of the world to serve as guides. That\u2019s how it worked then. Fast forward: \u201cI just did a Google search of Ethiopian cuisine, which turned up 23,900,900 results in .98 seconds,\u201d he emailed.\n\nArmed with more knowledge, today\u2019s diners are primed to document their every bite, behavior that has changed what happens in the kitchen and elsewhere. One reason hot food might be cold by the time you get it is because young chefs in particular know you might be photographing it and they want it to look its best. Minibar by Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s this year replaced its high-sheen oak counter in the open kitchen with a cherry wood surface \u2014 the better backdrop for Instagrammers, of course.\n\nSpike Gjerde in 2013; the Line hotel, which opened in 2017, is home to his restaurant A Rake\u2019s Progress.

Chef Johnny Monis at his no-reservations Little Serow (Scott Suchman).\n\nAs for my profession, the saying is true, notably in the years after Yelp made its debut in 2004: Everybody is a critic. Not only are amateur reviewers sharing with the world their thoughts about their dining experiences, they\u2019re commenting on professional critics. Frankly, I\u2019m fine with any competition. The more people talking about food, the merrier. Plus, competition tends to keep people on their toes.\n\nAt the dawn of my tenure, I got dozens of calls a day and baskets of letters a month. Now, readers are comfortable instant messaging me at all hours of the day on social media \u2014 alas. (I heart you, gang, but I host a weekly online chat to address any burning restaurant questions.)\n\nThirteen years ago, I declared Washington a top-tier restaurant city, evinced in part by my travels around the country: \u201cThe more I sample the handiwork of chefs outside the region, the more I admire what\u2019s on the menu right here at home.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until 2016, however, that national media seconded my vote of confidence. That\u2019s the year Bon App\u00e9tit anointed Washington the restaurant city of the year and the Michelin Guide began evaluating our dining establishments (not well or widely, perhaps, but the District lapped up the attention).\n\n\u201cBorn here, I\u2019d always considered D.C. a one-horse town,\u201d recalls veteran restaurateur Jackie Greenbaum, a champion of underdog neighborhoods. Three years ago, she visited a bunch of new spots in Los Angeles and says she couldn\u2019t wait to come home. \u201cI couldn\u2019t figure out why for a bit, then I realized it was because D.C. was just as cool as L.A., if not cooler, and lacked the pretense.\u201d\n\nShe has a point. Just look at all the good things in small packages, and all over the city. As far as fine dining is concerned, no market in the country does it better than Washington, which has replaced the form\u2019s traditional stuffiness with whimsy while remaining delicious. The Inn at Little Washington got the ball rolling here, with word plays on its menu and a cheese cart that moos, but successive high-end players keep the bar high. Witness the tiny (and oft-stolen) hammers used to shatter toffee at Kinship, the cocktails whipped up tableside at Pineapple and Pearls, the everything at Minibar.\n\nThe more I think about it, O\u2019Connell and my illustrated mug aren\u2019t the only constants on the Washington food scene. Look up from your bowls of ramen, your plates of pizza and your pavlova \u2014 this year\u2019s \u201cit\u201d dessert \u2014 and you\u2019ll see plentiful examples of that old standby, steak.\n\nFor years, some of us have tried to erase this city\u2019s out-of-date reputation as a meat market. We are more than steakhouses! But here we are in 2019, with plenty of new brands to try, and I\u2019m not going to dwell on it, because the grill-forward arrivals are outflanked by dozens of more compelling styles of cooking. In my mash note to Washington four years ago, Andr\u00e9s summed up the landscape when he said, \u201cWe are not one thing, but so many things at once.\u201d The sentiment is truer than ever today. Eat on.\n\n2000\n\nWhere I spend my own money\n\nIn the news: Phyllis C.
