A partisan operative?\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted Friday, kicking off a weekend of attacks on Democrats looking to impeach him over his interactions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nAlthough the whistleblower\u2019s identity is unknown to the public, a New York Times report identified the person as a man who works for the CIA who had been detailed to the White House for a time. In the complaint, the whistleblower does admit that the information is largely secondhand and that multiple officials supplied the information.\n\nCapitol Hill Republicans, in language mimicking Mr. Trump\u2019s, are seizing on that admission as they attack Democrats pursuing impeachment.\n\nThey say they\u2019re amazed that Democrats are moving to oust the president based on what they\u2019ve characterized as an interagency game of telephone \u2014 rather than firm evidence of an alleged \u201cquid pro quo\u201d involving $250 million in military aid to Ukraine and information about a political opponent.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re talking about impeaching the president based on an accusation based on hearsay,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, Ohio Republican, said the House Oversight Committee looks at two things when it assesses whistleblower accounts.\n\n\u201cFirst, did they have firsthand knowledge? And, second, what is their motivation? Was there some kind of bias? This guy has problems on both counts,\u201d Mr. Jordan told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nYet Democrats say they\u2019re on solid ground.\n\nThey cite a transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s July 25 call, available for all to see, in which Mr. Trump asks Mr. Zelensky to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d and look into what became of Democratic National Committee servers that were hacked in 2016.\n\nThe president also asked Mr. Zelensky to look into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, under the theory he called for a Ukrainian prosecutor\u2019s ouster in 2016 to help his son Hunter, who had business ties in Ukraine.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision to raise a political opponent in the conversation is a key part of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, which accurately highlights three main parts of the Trump-Zelensky call.\n\nJim Manley, a Democratic strategist who served as a spokesman to former Sen. Harry Reid, said Democrats will have an easier time leveraging this narrative than the Russian-meddling saga, which focused on the mysterious work of Robert Mueller\u2019s prosecutors behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cThe key difference is that what we are dealing with now is much easier to understand than the results of the Mueller investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, [Mr. Trump] has admitted to so much already. Support for impeachment is already beginning to tick up.\u201d\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries, New York Democrat, told CNN that Mr. Trump \u201chas been caught red-handed trying to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election by pressuring a foreign leader to target Joe Biden, an American citizen, for political gain.\u201d\n\nJoseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, told Congress that the whistleblower \u201cdid the right thing\u201d and followed the law.\n\nMr. Trump clearly disagrees, though, and hasn\u2019t been shy about saying so. He says the whistleblower was too far removed from the action, spoiling Exhibit A in the Democrats\u2019 zeal to impeach him.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018whistleblower\u2019 had NO direct knowledge of the call AND he is in favor of one of the corrupt 2020 Democrats,\u201d Mr. Trump told supporters in a fundraising email. \u201cTotal political bias!\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
