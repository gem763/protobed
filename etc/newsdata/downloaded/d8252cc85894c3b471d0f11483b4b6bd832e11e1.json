It originally appeared on scmp.com on Sept. 13, 2019.\n\nChina has announced that it will exclude imports of U.S. soybeans, pork and other farm goods from additional trade war tariffs, opening the door for significant purchases of agricultural products.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe official Xinhua News Agency reported on Friday that China's National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce made the exemption in response to the U.S.\u2019 decision of postpone an increase in the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese goods from October 1 to October 15.\n\nIt comes after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke on Thursday of the possibility of an \u201cinterim trade deal\u201d over the coming weeks.\n\nBeijing will allow Chinese businesses to purchase a \u201ccertain amount of farm products such as soybeans and pork\u201d from the United States, according to the Xinhua report. \u201cChina\u2019s market is big enough and there\u2019s great potential to import high-quality U.S. farm products.\u201d\n\nIt added that Chinese authorities hoped that \u201cthe U.S. will honour its word and fulfil its promises to create favourable conditions for cooperation for the two countries in the agriculture sector\u201d.\n\nHua Changchun, an economist at Guotai Junan Securities, a brokerage, said Beijing's move has increased the likelihood of a narrow trade deal.\n\n\u201cBut it's a small deal,\u201d Hua said. \u201cIt means that there would be no escalation of tariffs as China has agreed to make more purchases. It could provide a certain level of comfort to U.S. farmers and give Trump something to brag about.\u201d It marks the latest in series of rapid-fire developments this week that suggest a concerted effort by China to push for a partial, or interim, trade deal.\n\nIt also comes just hours after Reuters reported that private buyers in China bought \u201cat least 10 boatloads of U.S. soybeans on Thursday\u201d, the biggest mass purchase since June.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Commerce had not responded to a request for confirmation of exactly what the exemption would look like, with Friday being a public holiday in mainland China.\n\nHowever, both pork and soybeans have been subject to heavy duties, imposed during successive rounds of Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods.\n\nChina has levied three rounds of additional tariffs on U.S. frozen pork, including 25 percent in April 2018, 25 per cent in June 2019 and another 10 per cent in September 2019, bringing the final tariff to 72 per cent. If all the trade war tariffs were removed, the rate would return to 12 per cent, the \u201cmost favored nations\u201d duty paid by China\u2019s other trading partners.\n\nChina has also imposed 30 per cent in tariffs on yellow soybeans \u2014 the sort the U.S. grows in abundance \u2014 including 25 percent in June and 5 per cent on September 1, bringing the current tariff level to 33 per cent. If the additional tariffs are removed, tariffs on U.S. soybeans would return to 3 percent \u2014 the same rate paid by importers of Brazilian soybeans, which have largely filled the gap left by the U.S.\n\nProspects for a trade deal between the world\u2019s two biggest economies had already brightened after China and the U.S. exchanged \u201cgoodwill\u201d gestures ahead of a new round of trade talks scheduled in Washington next month.\n\nTrump said on Thursday he preferred a broad deal, though he left open the possibility of a limited version when asked whether he would agree to an interim deal.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are talking about, and I see a lot of analysts are saying: an interim deal, meaning we\u2019ll do pieces of it, the easy ones first,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cBut there\u2019s no easy or hard. There\u2019s a deal or there\u2019s not a deal. But it\u2019s something we would consider, I guess.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments came a day after he made a \u201cgoodwill\u201d gesture of postponing the planned 5 percentage point increase in the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese goods to October 15 from the originally planned October 1, a big day for Beijing as it will be celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nEarlier in the week, China had exempted 16 categories of U.S. products \u2014 including medicines \u2014 from import tariffs.\n\nLiu He, China\u2019s lead trade negotiator and the top economic aide to President Xi Jinping, welcomed Trump\u2019s postponement in a Thursday meeting with Evan Greenberg, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, a lobby group.\n\nLiu said working level trade meetings would take place next week to pave the way for the October meeting of top trade officials, who will focus on issues of \u201ctrade balance, market entry and investor protection\u201d. This suggests the negotiations would be mainly about trade and investment issues instead of structural changes in Chinese economy or security.\n\n\u201cThe whole world is expecting to see progress in China-U.S. negotiations,\u201d Liu said.\n\nShen Jianguang, chief economist at JD Digit and a veteran Chinese economy watcher, said neither side is in the mood for a further escalation of the trade dispute.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. could step back a bit on tariffs and China could offer to buy more U.S. farm products,\u201d Shen said. \u201cHowever, it will still be difficult to reach a broad agreement over structural issues.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Hua Changchun, an economist at Guotai Junan Securities, a brokerage, said Beijing's move has increased the likelihood of a narrow trade deal.", "authors": ["Zhou Xin", "South China Morning Post"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fa/2c/6a24cdf648d2a3cfb81b735b8455/190913-soybeans-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
