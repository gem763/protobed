Then the impeachment inquiry happened.", "language": "en", "text": "Trump has since hemmed, hawed and hedged on the issue. But last month, he dispatched his top advisers to Congress to try to forge a bipartisan pact.\n\nOn Sept. 18, Attorney General William P. Barr moved around the House and Senate with senior White House aides at his side, trying to negotiate a complicated deal. That shuttle diplomacy provided a glimmer of hope for gun-control advocates, even as some Trump aides said Barr wasn\u2019t speaking for the president.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s interested in exploring meaningful solutions that will actually protect people, make people safer,\u201d Barr told reporters in an impromptu briefing in the Capitol basement that day.\n\nThen the Trump news cycle, as it so often does, intervened. The national attention shifted from mass shootings to mass scandal, complete with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) formally declaring an impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure foreign allies and rivals to conduct investigations that would benefit him politically.\n\nNow, the energy behind a compromise on gun legislation has faded into the background, clustered with so many other legislative issues onto the back burner.\n\nAD\n\nThe story of a Virginia swing district town hall: From cheers to jeers\n\nAcross the country, voters also seem to be struggling with priorities. Two weeks after Barr\u2019s press briefing, The Washington Post attended a series of town hall meetings and found that people are concerned about many different issues, from impeachment to climate change, and that the gun safety focus blended in with the rest.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nAt a pair of constituent meetings in central Michigan, freshman Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) faced no questions about gun violence. Outside Detroit on Wednesday night, Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D) mentioned Democratic efforts to thwart gun violence in her opening remarks but never faced a question from a constituent in the 70-minute meeting.\n\nAt a long town hall 60 miles north of Philadelphia, Rep. Susan Wild (D) faced roughly three dozen questions from constituents, according to reports. Just one dealt with guns.\n\nAD\n\nThe issue has surfaced at some events, but mostly at meetings billed in advance as a discussion of gun rights. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Mich.), who supports many of the gun proposals advanced by House Democrats, had an angry clash with constituents at an event entirely devoted to guns and held in a building that also housed a gun club.\n\nAD\n\nOutside Houston, freshman Rep. Lizzie Fletcher (D-Tex.) held a gun forum Friday, focused entirely on ways to stop mass shootings and stem gun violence.\n\nAnd in southeastern Virginia, close to where 12 municipal employees were killed by a disgruntled ex-employee in May, Rep. Elaine Luria (D) included guns as one of four key issues to discuss at Thursday night\u2019s town hall. According to The Washington Post\u2019s Jenna Portnoy, the issue received 15 minutes of attention.\n\nAD\n\nNot surprisingly, the first portion of Luria\u2019s event was devoted to her decision to come out as a leading advocate for impeachment proceedings against Trump after he acknowledged that he pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to conduct investigations into former vice president Joe Biden, one of his potential 2020 rivals.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t spend 20 years defending our country in uniform to watch something like this happen,\u201d Luria, a retired Navy commander who served on nuclear ships, told the crowd.\n\nAD\n\nA big gun-control law always seemed a long shot, given the GOP\u2019s strong embrace of the NRA and with Democrats less inclined to settle for modest compromises given the huge public support for several of their proposals.\n\nAD\n\nBut some Democrats hold out hope that Trump would view the House\u2019s impeachment proceedings as a chance to show the public that he is concentrated on doing the work of president and not just focused on his own political survival.\n\n\u201cI think the president\u2019s got to make a calculation as to how he\u2019s going to manage through impeachment and other ways \u2014 that he can show he\u2019s still relevant,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (Conn.), one of the lead Democratic negotiators on guns, told reporters in Las Vegas at an event on the two-year anniversary of the nation\u2019s worst mass shooting. \u201cI\u2019ve made this point directly to the president a couple of times.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nProponents of stricter gun control face a reality check in the Senate\n\nBill Clinton\u2019s impeachment in 1998, followed by an acquittal in the Senate, offers one example of how things could play out. With a booming economy, Clinton famously declared he could \u201ccompartmentalize\u201d defending himself, while continuing to perform the normal work of chief executive.\n\nAD\n\nThe public continued to support him throughout. But at the same time, some politically risky moves \u2014 like revamping expensive entitlement reforms \u2014 got tossed aside. His liberal base would have blown up, and during an impeachment process retaining your base is critical for survival.\n\nIn the same way, Trump may now be even more inclined to tend to his conservative base to avoid flaming tensions that might weaken his standing, damaging prospects for a bipartisan gun deal. His Twitter feed and regular comments to the media make clear this is not someone looking for a bipartisan group hug on the White House lawn.\n\nAD\n\nAs a result, proponents of more gun control might have to go back to the political drawing board and try to keep up the pressure and defeat their opponents at the ballot box next year to truly change the law.\n\nDoing that, in the midst of the constant Trump media storm, will be their greatest political challenge.\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\n\nAD", "description": "Like so many other issues, the debate over guns has been moved to the back burner.", "authors": ["Paul Kane", "Senior Congressional Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://washingtonpost.com/pf/resources/images/favicon.ico?d=120", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
