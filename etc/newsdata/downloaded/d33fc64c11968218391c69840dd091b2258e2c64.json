Her work as a scholar shows that this is part of a pattern \u2014 when employees don't feel valued, they're less likely to stick around.\n\n81% of nonprofits can't get their staff to stay \u2014 and that may be due to the fact that they're not making employees feel valued.\n\nManagers should include employees in decision-making, emphasize openness to feedback, bring them into a sense of purpose, and value their growth.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nBefore I began to study and teach how to shape workplace relationships, I was a social worker. For about six years, I worked at a variety of nonprofits that served the needs of people with substance use problems, adolescents with mental health challenges, and children who had been abused.\n\nAt every job, I noticed a pattern. All my colleagues felt unappreciated and wanted to quit.\n\nAs a scholar, I've learned that this dynamic isn't unusual. Whether they are hospitals, museums, food pantries, churches, or environmental groups, all nonprofits constantly struggle to attract and retain qualified staff. Research I've conducted suggests that when employees feel valued and that their colleagues and bosses appreciate them, talented staff members become more likely to stick around.\n\nFeeling appreciated\n\nIn a national survey of 420 nonprofit organizations conducted in 2017, 28% of nonprofits said the top challenge they faced was hiring qualified staff, and 81% of nonprofits said they can't get the staff they do hire to stay.\n\nThis same survey indicated that nonprofits may not do enough to address these problems. Two out of three had no systematic way to recruit qualified staff and vet new hires. And four out of five did little to encourage employees to stick around, such as helping them feel valued by expressing appreciation for the unique talents they bring to the workplace, or giving them raises and paying salaries commensurate with their skills and experience.\n\nIn addition, the top three reasons employees give for leaving nonprofits, according to the results of a different survey, are dissatisfaction with their career opportunities, compensation and benefits, and workplace culture \u2014 or what it feels like to work there.\n\nThese results suggest that salaries \u2014 which can be lower in nonprofits than in comparable private-sector jobs \u2014 are not the only factor that makes it hard to keep talented people on board.\n\nMaking workplaces inclusive\n\nTo get a clearer view of how this works, I recently completed a study regarding how managers at hospitals can improve employee performance through greater inclusivity.\n\nInclusion, a term that generally refers to making all people feel welcome regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disabilities, is also about helping employees feel appreciated as unique individuals and helping them feel valued as key members of their team.\n\nCharacteristics such as your childhood economic status, where you went to school, your current neighborhood, or political views may have an effect on how comfortable and accepted you feel on the job.\n\nMore than half of all nonprofit jobs are in the healthcare field. And even though nonprofit hospitals generally pay their workers better than other nonprofits, they also have trouble hiring and retaining qualified staff, according to the 2018 State of the Nonprofit Sector survey.\n\nAs I explained in an article published in the Nonprofit Management & Leadership academic journal, when hospital managers and top leaders helped employees feel more included, they became more committed to stay and felt better about their performance.\n\nAdopting best practices\n\nResults from my hospital study and other research suggest that there are several things employers can do to create an inclusive workplace. Not only does this approach make good business sense, it is also the right thing to do by valuing all employees as human beings.\n\nHere are some practices I recommend for employers based on my research.\n\nEngage all employees to weigh in on important work-related decision-making.\n\nExpress appreciation for feedback given from employees of all job positions, not just when suggestions come from managers or leaders.\n\nTreat each employee as a unique individual, offering coaching, feedback, and opportunities that build on their own talents.\n\nCommunicate a shared sense of purpose and inspire a collective vision of the future.\n\nAnd making workplaces more inclusive may be the key to making not just nonprofit jobs more desirable, but any kind of workplace \u2014 including those in the private and public sectors.\n\nLike what you've read?
