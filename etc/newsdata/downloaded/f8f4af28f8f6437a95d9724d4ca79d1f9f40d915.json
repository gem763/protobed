REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo\n\nWith other major central banks easing monetary policy, Germany at risk of falling into recession and euro zone governments doing little to prop up the bloc, the ECB was left alone once again as the \u2018only game in town\u2019, forcing policymakers to deploy most of their few remaining tools.\n\nThe ECB cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points to a record low of -0.5%, promised that rates would stay low for longer and said it would restart bond purchases at a rate of 20 billion euros a month from Nov. 1.\n\n\u201cThe Governing Council expects (bond purchases) to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates,\u201d it said.\n\nSuch a formulation suggests that purchases could go on for years. Markets do not expect rates to rise for nearly a decade.\n\nThe rate cut will increase the cost to commercial banks of parking their more than 1 trillion euros worth of excess reserves at the central bank. The ECB said it would compensate lenders for part of this charge to ensure they continued to lend to the real economy.\n\nThe ECB also eased the terms of its long-term loan facility to banks and said it would introduce a multi-tier deposit rate facility to help them.\n\n\u201cThe Governing Council now expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2%,\u201d the ECB added.\n\nApproving fresh asset buys just nine months after a 2.6 trillion bond purchase scheme was halted suggests that policymakers fear recession risks are rising.\n\nData earlier on Thursday showed euro zone industrial production fell for a second month in July, while Germany\u2019s Ifo institute predicted a recession in Europe\u2019s economic powerhouse in the third quarter.\n\nAlthough markets had priced in a revival of asset purchases, over half a dozen conservative policymakers spoke out in public against such a scheme, leaving markets in doubt about how bold the ECB\u2019s measures would be.\n\nThe decision suggests that many of these skeptics eventually agreed, giving ECB President Mario Draghi a comfortable enough majority.\n\nThe single currency EUR=, which had fallen 3.5% against the dollar since the ECB began signaling an easing of its monetary policy in June, initially surged then quickly reversed course to ease. Yields on euro zone government bonds fell sharply.\n\nAttention now turns to Draghi\u2019s 1230 GMT press conference at which he will also reveal the bank\u2019s new economic projections.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\n\nWith just six weeks left before Draghi hands power to Christine Lagarde, he was all but certain to push through a big stimulus package, even if each of the measures come with complications, from limited potency to negative side-effects.\n\nThe ECB has persistently undershot its inflation target of almost 2% since 2013 so stimulus was essential to maintain credibility. But policy easing by central banks around the globe, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, also put the ECB in a bind.\n\nNot easing in sync with the Fed risked pushing the euro higher, which would then dampen inflation and put the bank even further away from its targets.\n\nBut Draghi\u2019s critics argue that the euro zone\u2019s biggest troubles \u2014 a global trade war, Brexit and China\u2019s slowdown \u2014 are outside the ECB\u2019s control, so any stimulus would have a limited impact.\n\nThey also argued that the bloc is merely experiencing a slowdown, not a recession, and that bond purchases, the ECB\u2019s most powerful tool, should be reserved for real crises, especially since the ECB has already used up much of its firepower in past rounds of stimulus.\n\nWith Lagarde taking over on Nov. 1, some also argued that the ECB should refrain from making long-term commitments that would tie the hands of the bank\u2019s next president.", "description": "The European Central Bank approved fresh stimulus measures on Thursday to prop up the ailing euro zone economy, cutting rates deeper into negative territory and relaunching an extended bond purchase scheme.", "authors": ["Balazs Koranyi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428838094&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1WB", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
