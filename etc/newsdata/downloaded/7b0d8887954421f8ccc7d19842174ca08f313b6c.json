Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), accusing her of equivocating on the central question of whether taxes would have to be raised on the middle class to pay for her \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan.\n\n\u201cYour signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this,\u201d Buttigeig said.\n\nThe South Bend mayor had set himself on a collision course with Warren in recent weeks, taking positions to establish himself as a centrist who is not afraid to take on the progressive wing of the party.\n\nLate in the debate, Buttigieg pivoted off of a Medicare for all squabble to accuse Warren of promoting \u201cinfinite partisan combat\u201d and to criticize former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenSupport drops for Medicare for All but increases for public option Bolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Federal prosecutors in New York examining Giuliani business dealings with Ukraine: report MORE for believing that Washington can return to normal after President Trump Donald John TrumpBusiness school deans call for lifting country-specific visa caps Bolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Federal prosecutors in New York examining Giuliani business dealings with Ukraine: report MORE leaves office.\n\nButtigieg also memorably clashed with Rep.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) faced a barrage of attacks from several of her rivals over some of the most defining issues of her presidential campaign. And she came out largely unscathed.\n\nWhether it was former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s (Texas) accusation that she appeared \u201cmore focused on being punitive\u201d than on healing the country\u2019s divisions or Sen.

And she swiftly pushed back at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s accusation, dismissing \u201cthe notion that anyone thinks I\u2019m punitive.\u201d\n\nIndeed, her performance in the debate showcased some lingering challenges for Warren. She will almost certainly continue to face questions about whether she would raise taxes on the middle-class to pay for a Medicare for All-type system. And the party\u2019s moderate wing will likely stoke skepticism in the practicality of her policy prescriptions.\n\nBut by the end of the night on Tuesday, Warren had showed that she was capable of standing up to attacks as a newfound frontrunner in the Democratic nominating contest. What\u2019s more, the barrage of criticism suggests that Warren has steadily supplanted Sen.

(Yang has warned that automation, not trade policy, is the primary culprit in the decline of manufacturing and other jobs in the U.S.).\n\nAnd his Freedom Dividend proposal, a form of universal basic income (UBI) that calls for giving every American over the age of 18 a $1,000-per-month stipend, got nods from some other candidates on stage.\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro said he was \u201cwilling to pilot something like UBI and see how that would work.\u201d And Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) suggested that she would consider a similar program if elected president.\n\nThat Yang\u2019s signature issues got so much attention in the debate suggests that, even if he\u2019s not a frontrunner, his presence in the Democratic primary field is having an effect.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.)\n\nKlobuchar has at times struggled to stand out in the crowded field of big personalities, but on Tuesday night she left a mark with a string of surprise attacks against Warren.\n\nOn Medicare for all, Klobuchar told Warren that \u201cat least Bernie is being honest\u201d about how he\u2019d pay for his plan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of being told this is a Republican talking point,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re making Republican talking points right now in this room.\u201d\n\nLater, Klobuchar ripped Warren for accusing the other contenders of seeking to protect billionaires.\n\n\u201cReality check, Elizabeth, not even the billionaire [Tom Steyer Thomas (Tom) Fahr Steyer2020 primary debate guide: Everything you need to know ahead of the October showdown The Hill's Campaign Report: Impeachment fight to take center stage at Dem debate CNN LGBTQ town hall interrupted by protesters MORE] wants to protect billionaires,\u201d Klobuchar said.\n\n\u201cJust because you have different ideas doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re fighting for regular people,\u201d she added.\n\nThe Minnesota Democrat has met the fundraising requirement for the November debate but still needs to meet the polling threshold to qualify. Tuesday night might be a step in that direction.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\n\nThe longtime frontrunner was not a winner or a loser on Tuesday night, largely melting into the background of a debate that centered around Warren.\n\nThat might not be a bad place for Biden to be, considering his polls numbers dipped after previous debates in which he was the focus of attacks.\n\nBiden\u2019s standout moment on Tuesday came when he blasted Trump\u2019s foreign policy.\n\n\u201cWe have an erratic, crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates out of fear,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBut at other times, it seemed that Biden flubbed his remarks.\n\nBiden is holding strong in the polls despite Warren\u2019s momentum, and it\u2019s unlikely that Tuesday night\u2019s debate will change that.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)\n\nTwo weeks after suffering a heart attack that raised new questions about his health and age, Sanders needed a debate performance that showcased his vigor and vitality.\n\nFor the most part, he appeared to rise to the challenge.\n\nHe got to riff on some of his core talking points, at one point even getting asked a question about whether billionaires should exist. (He responded with a condemnation of the amount of wealth controlled by the richest Americans, calling it a \u201ca moral and economic outrage\u201d).\n\nAnd at another point, he reassured the audience that he was \u201chealthy\u201d and \u201cfeeling great,\u201d prompting loud applause, and vowed to demonstrate his vitality through his work on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is how I think I can reassure the American people.\u201d\n\nBut Sanders was also uncharacteristically quiet at times, registering noticeably less speaking time than his two top-tier rivals, Warren and Biden.\n\nHis best moment of the night came after the debate, when he landed endorsements from Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Alexandria Ocasio-CortezObamas' first Netflix project nominated for Critics' Choice Documentary Awards Sanders wishes Ocasio-Cortez happy birthday Democrat launches primary challenge to Ocasio-Cortez MORE (D-N.Y.), Ilhan Omar Ilhan OmarIlhan Omar raises .1 million in third quarter New California law bans school lunch debt shaming The Hill's 12:30 Report \u2014 Presented by USAA \u2014 Ex-Ukraine ambassador testifies Trump pushed for her ouster MORE (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib Rashida Harbi TlaibTrump labels Tlaib 'a despicable human being' Tlaib says Democrats have discussed detaining White House officials who don't testify The 13 House Democrats who back Kavanaugh's impeachment MORE (D-Mich.). Support from members of the \u201cSquad\u201d will give his campaign a much-needed shot in the arm.\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii)\n\nIt was a strange week for Gabbard in the run-up to the debate.\n\nThere is enormous online interest in the Hawaii Democrat, who has angered many in her own party for accusing Democrats of being complicit in \u201cendless regime change wars\u201d and alleging that the Democratic National Committee is \u201crigging\u201d the primary against outsider candidates, such as herself.\n\nA New York Times story that ran over the weekend \u2013 the paper co-hosted Tuesday night\u2019s debate \u2013 detailed support for Gabbard on the far right and insinuated that Russia is actively promoting her campaign.\n\nGabbard accused the New York Times and CNN \u2013 a CNN panelist questioned Gabbard\u2019s loyalty to the U.S. on the air earlier in the day \u2013 of \u201csmearing veterans such as myself.\u201d\n\nAnd she had a strong moment where she accused \u201cboth parties and the mainstream media\u201d of \u201cchampioning and cheerleading for regime change war.\u201d\n\nHowever, it\u2019s unclear whether there\u2019s a big enough cross-section of Democrats to propel her into the next debate, particularly in a field that is flush with outsiders, including Yang and Sanders.", "description": "Twelve Democratic presidential candidates squared off at a debate on Tuesday night in Columbus, Ohio, where Sen.
