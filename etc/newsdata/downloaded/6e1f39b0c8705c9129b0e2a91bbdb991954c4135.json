It\u2019s cause for optimism.", "language": "en", "text": "Many factors account for these improving numbers, which are laid out in a report by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Economic growth is one: More than a quarter of the decline in child mortality over the past 28 years occurred in booming India, where 1.2 million fewer children died in 2017 than in 2000. Actions by governmental and nongovernmental agencies, to distribute lifesaving technology and medicines more widely, also were essential. Political stability and the relative absence of major war helped, too; only in Syria, scene of a horrific conflict since 2011, has the rate of child mortality not improved.\n\nChild mortality is far from the only area of improvement. In fact, the Gates Foundation\u2019s report notes, \u201cHealth and education are improving everywhere in the world.\u201d The share of the world\u2019s population living on $1.90 or less per day stood at 8 percent in 2018, down from 36 percent in 1990. The U.N.\u2019s goal was to bring to zero the number of people living in extreme poverty by 2030; that seems unlikely, according to the Gates Foundation report, but the wonder is how close the world may come.\n\nThere is no cause for complacency. The report\u2019s title, \u201cExamining Inequality,\u201d is properly intended to emphasize that people\u2019s life chances are still far too often a matter of such factors as geography and gender. Child mortality, along with other forms of suffering, continues to be highest in a band of countries in the drought-prone region of Africa known as the Sahel. And the southwest corner of one Sahel country, Chad, has a child mortality rate \u2014 about 15 percent \u2014 that is even higher than in the rest of the country. Awareness of these differences can and should help focus resources, including what must be sustained U.S. government support, on those areas where the need is greatest.\n\nStill, amid much justified concern about the warming planet\u2019s future, alarm must be leavened by recognition of what can be, and has been, accomplished, even in the face of seemingly in\u00adtrac\u00adtable problems. Optimism is not unrealistic.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Millions have come out of poverty. It\u2019s a reason to hope.\n\nFareed Zakaria: We have a bleak view of modern life.
