As you likely know, the people of that country have been facing starvation conditions for months on end, as well as being lacking in potable water and basic medical supplies. Fortunately, some aid has been arriving but almost all of it is immediately confiscated by the government so they can distribute it themselves. Good news, right?\n\nWell\u2026 yes and no. There are food relief boxes being given out (known as CLAP boxes) to some of the hungry people, but there\u2019s a catch. If you want to get one from the local brute squad, you are first required to sign a petition denouncing the United States and Donald Trump, specifically denouncing sanctions on the nation. It\u2019s part of the government\u2019s \u201cNo More Trump\u201d campaign. And if you don\u2019t sign, you don\u2019t get the food. (from Agence France Press)\n\nThe Maduro government has been gathering signatures among Venezuelans as part of its \u201cNo More Trump\u201d campaign\u2026 But the opposition says that the Maduro government has gathered the signatures through extortion over desperately needed nutritional assistance. Videos recently posted by the citizen journalism site Reporte Ya and elsewhere showed what appeared to be Venezuelans refusing orders to sign in exchange for receiving the aid, known locally as a CLAP box. \u201cIf you don\u2019t sign against Trump and sanctions, there won\u2019t be any CLAP food boxes,\u201d a municipal woman is quoted as saying by La Patilla, a prominent news site close to the opposition. The US State Department described Maduro\u2019s effort as a \u201cstarvation petition\u201d and said it was evidence that he could not win a fair election.\n\nThe fact that the dictator of the nation is forcing starving people to sign a petition in order to receive food doesn\u2019t exactly instill one with a lot of confidence as to the sincerity of the people opposing the United States. But then again, that tends to fit in well with the usual maneuvers of a socialist dictator, so there you go.\n\nBut why bother collecting petition signatures in the first place? As it turns out, the annual UN General Assembly is coming up later this month. There have been rumors that Maduro plans to attend and if so, he would like to present the petition to the United Nations and ask them to intervene on his behalf. Considering the number of UN nations that have already recognized Juan Guaido as interim president, his prospects probably aren\u2019t great.\n\nBut this scenario does bring up another fascinating if unlikely possibility. Let\u2019s just say that Maduro does travel to the UN General Assembly. He will be coming to New York City. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already guessing what I\u2019m about to suggest and saying I\u2019m crazy, but hear me out. All of the dignitaries traveling to the UN for these events are supposed to be essentially untouchable. I get that. But the United States, along with most of the world, no longer recognizes Maduro as the President of his country. We\u2019ve formally recognized Guaido\n\nIf Maduro isn\u2019t the President, he isn\u2019t the official representative with a seat at the conference. In fact, he holds no official position at all. He\u2019s just some guy from Venezuela riding through Manhattan in a limo who probably has a list of war crimes as long as your arm trailing behind him. What would happen if the FBI, CIA or some other agency just pulled his car over for a \u201ctraffic infraction,\u201d threw a bag over his head and shipped him off a secure holding facility?\n\nYes, yes\u2026 you\u2019re right. It would probably start a war, so we probably shouldn\u2019t do it. But if nothing else, it would make for the plot of a great Tom Clancy novel.", "description": "Playing some hardball", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Maduro-constitution.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
