REUTERS/Christinne Muschi\n\nAndrew Scheer, trying to defeat Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, insisted he had no plans to reopen the abortion debate if he won the election.\n\n\u201cNothing on this issue has changed for our party. We have always made it very clear ... that a Conservative government will not reopen this issue,\u201d Andrew Scheer told a televised news conference in Toronto.\n\nTrudeau kicked off the election campaign on Wednesday with polls showing him only slightly ahead of the Conservatives.\n\nWomen voters are particularly important for the Liberals. A Mainstreet poll conducted for the iPolitics website late last week showed 41.2% of women backed the Liberals with only 29.4% favoring the right-of-center Conservatives.\n\nThere are few restrictions on abortion and the Conservatives have traditionally steered clear of the topic, fearing they could alienate progressive voters. In Canada, unlike in the United States, abortion has not been a major political issue.\n\nScheer made his remarks after the Liberals circulated a video showing Rachel Willson, a Conservative candidate in Toronto, saying she was shocked at the lack of limits on abortion.\n\nLiberal cabinet minister Carolyn Bennett, writing on Twitter, asked \u201cIs the abortion debate really closed, Andrew Scheer?\u201d and noted he had decided to start his Toronto campaign alongside Willson.\n\nTrudeau did not attack Scheer directly, telling reporters in British Columbia that every Liberal candidate would \u201cdefend women\u2019s rights unequivocally.\u201d\n\nScheer accused his opponents of fear-mongering in a bid to deflect attention from \u201ctheir scandals and corruption.\u201d\n\nLast month, a top watchdog ruled Trudeau had breached ethics rules by pressuring the former justice minister to ensure a major construction firm would avoid a corruption trial.\n\nIn brief remarks, Willson said she had never made a secret of her views on abortion but would be focusing on issues that united Canadians.\n\nPolls show affordability is one of the main issues worrying voters and Trudeau announced that if reelected, the Liberals would introduce a 1% tax on non-resident non-Canadians to help prevent foreign speculation from driving up housing prices.\n\nTrudeau will skip a debate hosted by Macleans news magazine that starts at 8 p.m. eastern time (midnight GMT) although Scheer and other party leaders will attend.\n\nThe Liberals were forced to charter a new campaign plane after the bus carrying reporters following the campaign scraped the wing of Trudeau\u2019s Boeing 737. Party officials said the travel schedule would not be affected.", "description": "The leader of Canada's main opposition Conservative Party on Thursday distanced himself from comments by a candidate opposing abortion, remarks that could hurt his chances with women voters in an Oct. 21 election.", "authors": ["David Ljunggren", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429111246&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B1GG-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
