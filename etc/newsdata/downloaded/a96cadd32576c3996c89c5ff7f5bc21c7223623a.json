Does He Have Room to Grow?", "language": "en", "text": "Welcome to Poll Watch, our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election.\n\nWith former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren jockeying for the top spot in the Democratic presidential race, we decided to take a look at another candidate who\u2019s been quietly climbing out of the lower rung: Pete Buttigieg. Are there signs that he could grow into a leading candidate, ultimately rivaling \u2014 maybe even beating \u2014 Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren?\n\nThe 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., Mr. Buttigieg began his presidential campaign with a bang last winter and picked up a head of steam in the spring. But for the last several months he has been largely treading water among the second tier of candidates.\n\nA recent batch of polling suggests that could soon change.\n\nPositioning himself as a Midwestern realist who could unify voters across the aisle, Mr. Buttigieg has focused much of his campaign\u2019s formidable war chest on Iowa. He has opened more campaign offices than any other candidate in that state, which is less than four hours west of South Bend on Route 80 and will host the Democrats\u2019 first nominating contest in February 2020.", "description": "The mayor of South Bend, Ind., has opened more offices in Iowa than any other Democratic presidential candidate.
