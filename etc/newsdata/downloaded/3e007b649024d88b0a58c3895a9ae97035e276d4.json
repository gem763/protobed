And so, to say that somehow a venue that Barack Obama paid $20,000 for is now escalating to $500,000-plus really tells you everything you need to know about what the motivation is here,\" he told Hemmer on Wednesday.\n\nTRUMP TAKING 2020 CAMPAIGN TO ILHAN OMAR'S DISTRICT WITH MN RALLY\n\nThe Trump campaign announced on Twitter that, after threats of a legal battle, the Target Center was no longer a point of contention: \"The arena in Minneapolis is fully approved...President Trump's Keep America Great rally will go on as scheduled,\" campaign manager Brad Parscale wrote to supporters.\n\nSecurity costs for former President Barack Obama's health care rally at the Target Center in 2009 hovered at around $20,000, according to police estimates.\n\nSpicer noted that while it's possible to inflate the cost over time, \"$500,000 is pretty out of proportion for what inflation has been over those years.\"\n\nIn a news conference on Tuesday, Frey said that \"it's not extortion to expect someone to pay their bills.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We will show with bracing clarity that Minneapolis is a world-class city and we will not take the bait. We've all seen the rhetoric that is pushed out at these Trump campaign rallies. It is hateful. It is divisive, and we do not welcome that kind of rhetoric here in Minneapolis,\" he told reporters.\n\nThe president took to Twitter later in the day to complain that \"Presidents Clinton and Obama paid almost nothing!\" and that \"Radical Left Dem Mayor of Minneapolis Jacob Frey\" is \"doing everything possible to stifle Free Speech despite a record sell-out crowd at the Target Center.\"\n\nHe also tweeted in favor of dumping both Frey and Democratic Congresswoman and \"Squad\"-member Ilhan Omar.\n\n\"Minnesota is a great state and great people and the idea that the mayor is trying to silence the president's campaign from going in there and bring his message really speaks to how scared I think the Democrats are that the president could pick up those 10 electoral votes,\" Spicer declared.", "description": "Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that\u00a0Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and city officials engaged in \"political intimidation\" by trying to\u00a0hinder\u00a0Thursday's 2020 Trump campaign rally at the Target Center.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/spicer-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
