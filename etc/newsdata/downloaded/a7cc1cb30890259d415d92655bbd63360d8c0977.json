But the studio\u2019s also game to bring some fresh blood into the dinosaur-laden fray.\n\nVariety reports that She\u2019s Gotta Have It\u2019s DeWanda Wise has joined the cast of the third Jurassic World film in a leading but currently-undescribed role. The news comes just after Sorry for Your Loss\u2019 Mamoudou Athie signed on for another leading role in the film, though details of who he\u2019ll be playing also remain a mystery.\n\nAside from the fact that Drs.
