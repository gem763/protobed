We took over from him and quickly dealt with the blaze.\n\n\u201cIt soon transpired that it was Jason Donovan who noticed the fire from his property over the road.\u201d\n\nJason Donovan in the foreground of the picture in his underwear.

This is a good reason to always wear PJ s to bed ( in case of emergencies ) but much more importantly to have fire extinguishes at hand in the home. https://t.co/SlawIuRxwt pic.twitter.com/4rqGpSFZjh\n\nWolfe said the fire, believed to have been caused by a fault in electrical cabling, was under control just before 4.30am.\n\nDonovan has recently been playing Pharaoh in a revival of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat in the West End, 28 years after he played the lead role in the musical.\n\nNeighbours has been on British screens for 33 years, although its viewing figures have plummeted since its heyday when the wedding of Scott and Charlene (played by Minogue) attracted a UK audience of 19.1 million people.\n\nNevertheless, its popularity in Britain has kept it going, with Channel 5 signing a four-year deal for more episodes and a series of specials in 2017, when its future in Australia was under threat.\n\nAs well as Donovan and Minogue, it has made stars out of the likes of Guy Pearce, Delta Goodrem, Jesse Spencer, Natalie Imbruglia, Margot Robbie and Liam Hemsworth.", "description": "Australian soap star pressed his fire extinguisher into action to tackle blaze near his UK home", "authors": ["Haroon Siddique"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2ba66c1f2be793c213f7465e218335c185378f3/0_34_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=00fe40d949622f5295a56d9e3336e426"}
