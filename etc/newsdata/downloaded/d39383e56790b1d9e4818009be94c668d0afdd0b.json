Like when did that ever happen?,' the 40-year-old Cougar Town actress told Eve Rodsky of Harper's Bazaar.\n\nBusy considered divorce after getting frustrated raising daughters Birdie, 11, and six-year-old cricket with little help from Marc, 48.\n\nProud mom: Busy Philipps nearly left her husband Marc Silverstein because she felt he was not pulling his weight parenting their daughters Birdie, 11, and Cricket, six\n\n'My thinking was that if I leave, at least then maybe I'd get two days off a week,' Busy said.\n\nMarc averted the divorce by agreeing to 'be the one to stay home with the kids,' and according to Busy they wound up 'creating our own system.'\n\nWhen she floated divorce: 'Marc was like: 'I'll do anything.' And I was like: 'Okay, then do everything. Because I have done it all, all by myself, and I'm done, dude.''\n\nThe Freaks And Geeks alumna said of her husband: 'And he made the call: He should be the one to stay home with the kids.'\n\nForthright: The 40-year-old Cougar Town actress told Eve Rodsky (right) of Harper's Bazaar: 'My thinking was that if I leave, at least then maybe I'd get two days off a week'\n\nShe shared: 'I was fully out the door. I wasn't expecting anything from him, but what we ended up doing was creating our own system.'\n\nIn this 'system,' arranging Birdie and Cricket's meals became Marc's responsibility, as did getting them to school in the morning and to bed at night.\n\n'He now loves his mornings with the girls. He'll make my Bulletproof coffee and bring it into the bedroom while I'm still sleeping, and then leave to take the kids to school.'\n\nBusy went on: 'He has conversations with them that I'm jealous of. The closeness he now has with these girls, it's really special.'\n\nSave: Marc averted the divorce by agreeing to 'be the one to stay home with the kids,' and according to Busy they wound up 'creating our own system'; pictured last April\n\nShe confessed: 'Sometimes I've wondered about Marc taking over Birdie's bedtime. I've thought to myself: 'Is this the right thing for her?' But I'm not going to call him out on what I think is right or wrong because he's doing it!'\n\nBusy dished during the interview: 'You know what they say about divorce, right? In friend groups, divorce is a house of cards.'\n\nThe Illinois-born TV star explained: 'In friend groups, if you're all married, you have a silent agreement to be miserable together. And a lot of times the person who decides to leave is vilified in the group because you've upset the status quo. Like: 'How dare you? We had a f***ing agreement to be miserable.''\n\nBusy recalled that 'here was the thing I kept saying to myself, I am not certain that I will ever be happy, but I know for certain I do not have to feel miserable all the time.'\n\nShe has been married since 2007 to Marc, who with his work partner Abby Kohn has written such movies as Never Been Kissed and He's Just Not That Into You.\n\nIn her 2018 memoir This Will Only Hurt A Little, Busy wrote that her Oscar-nominated pal Michelle Williams gave her some advice when she was mulling divorce.\n\nSide by side: She has been married since 2007 to Marc, who with his work partner Abby Kohn has written such movies as Never Been Kissed; the married couple are pictured in May\n\n'It would be really awful for two years and then you would find a new normal but honestly, if you can keep your family intact, I think you should do it,' said Michelle.\n\nBusy also wrote that around the time she was on the brink of leaving Marc, she had developed an emotional attachment to another man.\n\n'There was a man I was friends with, another dad. We'd been having lunch and stuff. Texting. Talking on the phone a lot.... Honestly, I had a crush on him. I like him. Maybe I even loved him? He clearly liked me too,' she wrote in the book.", "description": "The 40-year-old actress revealed that after her husband Marc Silverstein, 48, avoided divorce by pulling his weight parenting that their daughters now sometimes call her 'Dad'.", "authors": ["Sameer Suri For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/23/19275754-0-image-a-14_1570143526670.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
