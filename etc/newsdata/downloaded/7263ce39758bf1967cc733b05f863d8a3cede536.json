One of them shows a busty woman in a revealing outfit being handed a bottle of American whiskey\n\nThe content of the paintings had initially led staff to believe that the room may formerly have been used as a gentleman's lounge\n\nOne of them shows a busty woman in a revealing outfit with a smutty-looking man handing her a bottle of rye - a type of American whiskey.\n\nAnd a second painting depicts what appears to be a bulldog holding a bone next to a musical stave.\n\nHistorian Anthony Beeson said they were the work of American G.I's from Wolrd War Two as Englishmen would not have referred to rye\n\nHartford Care, the home's managing firm, was intrigued by the discovery and put out an appeal to a local history group.\n\nBristol-based historian Anthony Beeson soon came forward and said that the murals are 'certainly' the work of American G.I's who were stationed in the building during Wolrd War Two.\n\nHe added: 'Several of the large houses in the area like Pitch and Pay were requisitioned for troops.\n\n'Note that the bottle has 'rye' written on it which no Englishman would do.\n\n'I suspect it was their mess room or the like.\n\n'The bulldog probably refers to the song Knick Knack Paddywack... which would be very appropriate for a bar and also account for the notes.'\n\nAlex Mazur-Kruszynska, the manager at the Stokeleigh Care Home, said it was a 'really exciting' discovery and 'the best thing' to happen to the home.\n\nShe added: 'We had no idea they were there until we started refurbishing the room and our maintenance man was taking the woodchip off the walls.\n\n'We thought at first it might have just been used as a gentleman's lounge.\n\nA second painting depicts what appears to be a bulldog holding a bone next to a musical stave\n\nIt is thought that this mural refers to the song Knick Knack Paddywack which would have been appropriate for a bar setting\n\nThe home said that it will need to continue with the refurbishment but will try to preserve the murals as much as possible. Pictured: Staff member David Parton showing a resident, Jan, the paintings\n\n'It was very interesting to find out what they really were.\n\n'Finding the murals is the best thing, really. The residents find it fascinating as well.'\n\nSadly, Alex said that the home will need to continue painting over the murals in order to prepare the room for its next resident.\n\nBut added: 'We're planning on putting plasterboard over the mural and painting on to that, so that we can preserve the painting itself.'", "description": "The risque murals were found during refurbishment\u00a0at the Stokeleigh Residential Care Home in Stoke Bishop, Bristol.", "authors": ["Raven Saunt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/10/19829580-0-image-a-78_1571304744259.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
