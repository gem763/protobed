Photos from the event show crowds of attendees drinking copious amounts of alcohol, stripping their clothes and some even bathing in the mud.\n\nThe event, in its 21st year, attracted more than 20,000 ute lovers, who celebrated with two days of live music, ute parades, whip-cracking, drinking and animal displays.\n\nBut wild videos, shared by ute muster attendees on social media over the weekend, show the muster late at night, when the official program of entertainment and country western music acts had finished.\n\nThe festival, known for hard drinking as much as it is for utes, mud and leather boots, appears to have its own \u201cafter dark\u201d program of events run by wild festivalgoers.\n\nVideos show the crowd getting more and more rowdy, standing around a pit of mud, egging pairs of men on to run at one another and fight in a large mud pit.\n\nThe challenge soon escalated, as those in the scrum put traffic cones on their heads, running at each other at full speed until they collided and fell heavily on the ground to the raucous applause of the hundreds who\u2019d gathered to watch.\n\nMeanwhile, a smaller group shared videos of themselves online heating a rod of metal and attempting \u201cblacksmithing Deni style\u201d around a fire.\n\nThey heated the metal until it was bright red with heat, and then began hitting it with various objects, and pouring more oil on the fire to increase the heat.\n\nFires are permitted at the muster, but have to be contained inside a drum \u201cno bigger than half a 44-gallon drum\u201d, according to the festival site. The organiser also imposed controls on the size of wood brought inside the festival.\n\nAnother video showed a man sleeping in the dirt who is unresponsive when his friend shines a light on him and jokes, \u201cMe and him are doing a beer bong!\u201d\n\n\u201cRighto, where\u2019s the stomach pump,\u201d the man says as the young man rolls over in the dirt and continues sleeping on the ground.\n\nThe muster does boast a number of different events and attractions for the tens of thousands of attendees, including wood chopping, bull ride displays, pig and piglet racing, helicopter rides and numerous amusements for children.\n\nThe festival also attracts some of the biggest names in country and western music, with Tim McGraw and Lee Kernaghan performing over the weekend.\n\nThe festival was originally founded in 1999 to attract visitors to the struggling town of Deniliquin, when the area was badly ravaged by drought. The town now boasts the title of the Ute Capital of the World, and after the festival became successful, a ute was erected on a pole in the town, to commemorate the success of the event.\n\nNews.com.au contacted the organisers of the Deni Ute Muster for comment but did not receive a response.\n\nNews.com.au contacted NSW Police regarding the event but did not receive a comment.\n\n@dollyybird | phoebe.loomes@news.com.au", "description": "Videos from a rural Aussie ute muster have shown wild and rowdy crowds jeering men to mud wrestle with traffic cones on their heads and groups of festivalgoers hammering at searing hot metal.", "authors": ["Phoebe Loomes"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8f9fcf361f1f2f3d94c8fa477c0a8d1e?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
