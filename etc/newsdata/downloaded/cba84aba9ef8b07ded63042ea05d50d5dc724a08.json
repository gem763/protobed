In 1992, the journal Nature rejected Peter J. Ratcliffe\u2019s article, telling him that \u201cwe have sadly concluded, on balance, that your paper would be better placed in a more specialized journal, particularly given the competition for space.\u201d Twenty-seven years later, judges praised Ratcliffe and fellow winners William Kaelin Jr. and Gregg Semenza for discoveries that could lead to \u201cpromising new strategies to fight anaemia, cancer and many other diseases.\u201d\n\nRatcliffe\u2019s vindication is an old Nobel tradition, and not just for medicine. Several science winners, from Enrico Fermi to Murray Gell-Mann, had their findings initially rejected. Hans Krebs was informed by Nature in 1937 that there was no space for his paper on the citrus acid cycle, now better known as the Krebs Cycle, and the basis for his 1953 medal. Rosalyn S. Yalow, winner of a Nobel in 1977, was informed years earlier by The Journal of Clinical Investigation that her landmark findings on insulin and antibodies were \u201cdogmatic\u201d and \u201cnot warranted by the data.\u201d\n\nIn literature, some of the most celebrated writers were once considered too strange, too limited or just too boring. Several publishers turned down Toni Morrison\u2019s first novel, \u201cThe Bluest Eye,\u201d and she was chastised for years by white critics for focusing too much on black characters. The novelist Reynolds Price would cite her for \u201cthe understandable but weakening omission of active white characters,\u201d an opinion he later withdrew about the 1993 laureate.\n\nErnest Hemingway was at the center of American letters when he won the Nobel, in 1954, but at the start, he was criticized for his minimalist style and libertine characters. In turning down \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d Hemingway\u2019s landmark novel about the 1920s \u201clost generation,\u201d Moberley Luger of publisher Peacock & Peacock called Hemingway\u2019s work \u201cboth tedious and offensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou really are a man\u2019s man, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Luger told the author in 1925, the year before Scribner\u2019s released his book. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to hear that you had penned this entire story locked up at the club, ink in one hand, brandy in the other. Your bombastic, dipsomaniac, where-to-now characters had me reaching for my own glass of brandy.\u201d\n\nOther literature winners enduring initial discouragement were Pearl Buck, Isaac Beshevis Singer and 1983 laureate William Golding, whose Dystopian classic \u201cLord of the Flies\u201d was rejected numerous times. Faber & Faber editor Charles Monteith described the book as an \u201cAbsurd & uninteresting fantasy.\u201d It was \u201cRubbish & dull. Pointless.\u201d\n\nThat was Monteith\u2019s reaction after the first chapter. He then kept reading, suggested that he and Golding meet and worked on some revisions.\n\n\u201cI have just finished reading the galleys of \u2018Lord of the Flies\u2019 and I\u2019m even more enthusiastic about it than I was before,\u201d he eventually told the author, whose book was released by Faber in 1954. \u201cThough I must have read it through four or five times by now, I still simply couldn\u2019t put the proofs down until I had finished them. It\u2019s had precisely the same effect on several other people here; indeed, in two cases I have had complaints that it resulted in nightmares! What a terrific book it is.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Some of the world's most innovative ideas and creations have started out in a rejection pile.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Hillel Italie"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/britain_nobel_prize_medicine_92243_c0-202-4683-2933_s1200x700.jpg?94be4edb58b3d72fc61cecf8d353a973e2af925f", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
