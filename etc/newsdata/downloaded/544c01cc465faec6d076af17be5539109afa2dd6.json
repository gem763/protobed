But up until recently he'd been praying for a second shot.\n\nWith Khloe also single after ex-boyfriend Tristan Thompson allegedly cheated with Kylie Jenner's best friend Jordyn Woods, in May Lamar admitted he was still waking up every day \"hoping\" to get back with the \"love of his life.\"\n\nBut in early September it was revealed he'd suddenly moved on with trainer and life coach, Sabrina Parr.\n\nAnd Khloe was forced to endure a run-in with the pair as they all partied at the Hyde Lounge in West Hollywood last Wednesday.\n\n(Image: NGRE / BACKGRID)\n\n(Image: NGRE / BACKGRID)\n\nLeaving the venue, Khloe, 35, could be seen staring out of the car window with her finger clasped to her mouth in an apparent bid not to cry.\n\n\"Her eye expression looks sad and she\u2019s gazing off into the middle distance, suggesting she\u2019s having a very serious conversation in her own head,\" body language expert Judi James told Mirror Online.\n\n\"Her index finger is placed over her top lip in a signal of evaluation that can also be a self-comfort gesture. This pressing of the finger to the base of the nose can also occur when someone\u2019s trying not to cry and Khloe could be getting rather tearful here,\" she added.\n\nKhloe has certainly been on an emotional rollercoaster with Lamar. They married after just one month of dating in 2009.\n\n(Image: Photographer Group/MEGA)\n\nAnd while everything was perfect at first, the marriage disintegrated under the pressure of Lamar's serial cheating and spiralling drug addiction, forcing Khloe to file for divorce in December 2013.\n\nShe briefly stopped proceedings to make medical decisions when he suffered a near-fatal overdose at a Nevada brothel in 2015.\n\nSadly though, their issues could not be fixed and the divorce was finalised a year later. And Judi says the trauma Khloe suffered would have made their meeting even more distressing for her.\n\n(Image: Rex)\n\n\"Meeting an ex can always be painful, even when you've both moved on,\" she explains.\n\n\"But meeting an ex who was once unmanageable but now seems to have formed a solid, loving relationship with another woman can be especially upsetting,\" she continued.\n\nAnd she believes seeing Lamar looking happy and healthy with another woman may have given her second thoughts.\n\n\"Khloe could even be wondering if she tried hard enough or quit too soon on their own time together. She could also be considering rebooting their relationship. It's often too easy to blame yourself in a situation like this that is linked to feelings of control,\" Judi said.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\n\"Lamar\u2019s behaviour at the time was probably out of Khloe\u2019s control but as a strong woman this could be a difficult message to absorb.\"\n\nLast week Lamar was accused of taking a pop at Khloe when he boasted that his new girlfriend was 'all natural'.\n\n\"Scrollin through @getuptoparr page like DAMN!!! My baby is an extremely hard worker. All NATURAL and real from the inside out,\" he gushed on Instagram .\n\n\"God has bought her in my life for me to reach my full potential and that\u2019s to be Great. I got nuttin but Love for this woman.\"\n\nBut just weeks before, Khloe was the focus of his affections when he described their marriage as \"bliss\".\n\n\"I was the happiest I\u2019ve ever been,\u201d he wrote in his 2019 autobiography, Darkness To Light.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: FilmMagic)\n\n\" At the start of our marriage, I was faithful to her. I could not handle the lethal cocktail of the spotlight, addiction, a diminishing career, and infidelity. Oh, did I mention the paranoia, anxiety, depression?\n\n\"I couldn\u2019t keep my d**k in my pants or the coke out of my nose. Drug addicts are incredibly skilled at hiding their habit. I\u2019d get defensive, and Khloe would just drop it.\u201d\n\nAfter his overdose, Khloe admitted she still loved Lamar deeply but had to cut ties for the sake of her own emotional wellbeing.\n\n\"It definitely makes me sad because I still believe he is my soulmate, but sometimes we lose our soulmates and that\u2019s okay,\" she said on Keeping Up With the Kardashians in 2015. \"Right now I have to do what\u2019s best for me.\u201d", "description": "Khloe Kardashian cut a sombre figure after partying at the same club as Lamar Odom and his new girlfriend, Sabrina Parr", "authors": ["Frances Kindon", "Image", "Ngre", "Backgrid", "Photographer Group Mega", "Rex", "Daily Record", "Getty Images", "Filmmagic"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20532159.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_PAY-Khloe-Kardashian-looks-deep-in-thought-after-attending-the-same-party-as-her-Ex-Husband.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
