The four automakers, by contrast, are acting in the public interest.\n\nThat the government of the United States would fight to loosen emissions standards in the face of the growing threat posed by climate change also boggles the mind. Not content to fiddle while the planet burns, Mr. Trump is fanning the flames.\n\nFord, BMW North America, Volkswagen Group of America and Honda struck a deal with the State of California in July. They agreed to reach an average fuel efficiency standard of at least 51 miles per gallon by 2026 . That falls short of an Obama administration rule that would have required average fuel efficiency of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. But it is certainly better than the goal of 37 miles per gallon favored by the Trump administration.", "description": "The Justice Department is roughing up Mr. Trump\u2019s political enemies and threatening the environment.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/06/opinion/06Antitrust2/06Antitrust2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
