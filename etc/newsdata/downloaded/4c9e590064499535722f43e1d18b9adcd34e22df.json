She decided to get breast implants, she told MarketWatch, after consulting with a plastic surgeon and being told they were safe.\n\nBut three months later, she had fatigue and swelling in her arms and legs, as well as numbness, weakness and pain in her left hand and arm. Migraines and anxiety set in, and it became hard to function on a daily basis. The implants also appeared to exacerbate her Graves\u2019 disease, an autoimmune disorder. She hadn\u2019t been advised of the link between autoimmune conditions and potential poor breast-implant outcomes, she said.\n\nAll told, Valoras\u2019s hospital and emergency-room visits; specialist visits to rule out conditions like aneurysm, herniated disc and nerve damage; pain management including physical therapy and chiropractors; and the cost of the implants themselves totaled about $100,000. ***To date, she has paid more than $55,000 out of pocket, she said.\n\nOn Oct. 31, 2017, Valoras had her implants removed and immediately felt about \u201c80% better.\u201d\n\n\u201cA fully informed consent would have prevented these issues, or at least given me a choice around these issues,\u201d said Valoras, 52, who now advocates for women with breast implant-related illness. \u201cBut I was not fully informed.\u201d\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday recommended that breast-implant manufacturers help make sure patients are wise to the risks and benefits associated with the devices, having heard \u201cloud and clear\u201d the clamor for increased awareness.\n\nThe agency\u2019s draft guidance advised that manufacturers lay out risks relating to symptoms like joint pain and fatigue, as well as a link between breast implants and a rare cancer of the immune system, in a boxed warning, also known as a \u201cblack-box warning,\u201d that would appear on product labels.\n\nSuch boxed information would warn that \u201cbreast implants are not lifetime devices,\u201d the agency added, and that complications become increasingly likely over time, potentially prompting the need for additional surgery.\n\n\u201cWe have heard from many women that they are not fully informed of the risks when considering breast implants,\u201d FDA principal deputy commissioner Amy Abernethy and Jeffrey Shuren, the director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement. \u201cThey\u2019ve stated that they need more information to facilitate meaningful conversations with their doctors and to make appropriate decisions for themselves.\u201d\n\nThe agency\u2019s draft guidance will be open for public comment for the next 60 days; manufacturers can then choose to follow the finalized guidance or opt for their own FDA-compliant labeling methods.\n\nPatients may have to pay for surgery more than once\n\nThe recommended warning about implants not being a \u201clifetime device\u201d is an important piece of information for patients who are budgeting and planning for the procedure, said Andrea Pusic, a reconstructive-surgery expert who is the chief of plastic surgery at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. Younger patients may need additional surgery related to their devices in perhaps five, 10 or 15 years.\n\nBreasts can change for a variety of reasons, including pregnancy, nursing, weight changes and hormonal changes like menopause.\n\n\u201cIt is helpful to plan from a financial perspective that you\u2019re not just paying the cost of that one surgery,\u201d she said. \u201cImplants are devices \u2014 they need surveillance, and sometimes they need to be replaced.\u201d\n\nBreasts can change for a variety of reasons, including pregnancy, nursing, weight changes and hormonal changes like menopause, added Herluf Lund, a St. Louis-based plastic surgeon and member of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, in a statement sent to MarketWatch.\n\n\u201cAs the breasts change through life, the breast implants that were selected at an earlier stage of life may not longer meet the needs or the desires of the patient, meaning the patient may need to exchange her breast implants for a different size or shape to meet her goals,\u201d he said.\n\nBreast augmentation was the most popular cosmetic surgical procedure in 2018, with 313,000 procedures performed, according to data from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, another trade group. Breast-augmentation surgery costs $3,824 on average, according to the organization, while the average cost for implant-removal surgery is $2,566.\n\n***Valoras estimates her implant procedure cost around $7,400. While she says her removal would normally have cost another $6,150, she paid only $1,650 for anesthesia and room time and wasn\u2019t charged for other parts of the procedure.\n\nBoxed warnings call attention to \u2018serious or life-threatening risks\u2019\n\nA boxed warning is one of the FDA\u2019s most serious warnings. It typically appears in a bold font in a black box on prescription drug labels and is designed to \u201ccall attention to serious or life-threatening risks,\u201d according to the agency.\n\nFor example, the agency added boxed warnings to some prescription opioid pain medicines and some drugs that treat anxiety in 2016 after discovering that combining the two medicines could result in death.\n\nThe FDA also recommended that breast-implant manufacturers provide a \u2018patient-decision checklist\u2019 along with informational brochures or booklets.\n\nThe FDA also recommended that breast-implant manufacturers provide a \u201cpatient-decision checklist\u201d along with informational brochures or booklets, for use during a patient-surgeon consultation.\n\nA sample checklist published by the FDA included information on considerations for a successful breast-implant candidate, surgery risks, cancer risk, long-term impacts of implants, and systemic symptoms some women have reported following their procedures.\n\nManufacturers could also include easy-to-grasp product ingredient information on labels and provide more information on the patient \u201cdevice card\u201d that contains details on the specific implants they have, the FDA further advised.\n\nMeanwhile, patients with silicone gel-filled implants should receive screenings for ruptures to their implants after five or six years, then every two years following the initial screening, the agency suggested.\n\nPatients have been asking for better warnings of the risks\n\nWomen who said they had endured complications related to their breast implants, among them Valoras, urged the FDA during a March advisory-panel meeting to provide better warnings of the risks.\n\n\u201cWhat is amazing is that they\u2019re listening,\u201d Valoras said. \u201cI wish my story was an anomaly.\u201d\n\nAllergan AGN, +0.24% also voluntarily recalled its Biocell textured breast implants and tissue expanders at the FDA\u2019s request in July, after the agency cited increased risk of breast implant-associated anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), a kind of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma linked to the products.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard loud and clear from the public advisory panel meeting we held earlier this year and from the information we\u2019ve gathered from other ongoing efforts to engage with patients and stakeholders that there is a distinct opportunity to do more to protect women who are considering breast implants,\u201d Abernethy and Shuren\u2019s statement said.\n\n\u2018Previous communications to patients interested in breast implants for either reconstruction or augmentation purposes were felt to be overly lengthy and confusing.\u2019\n\nLund said that the measures prescribed by the FDA were \u201cmeant to enhance the process by which patients receive and understand the information needed as part of the informed consent process.\u201d \u201cPrevious communications to patients interested in breast implants for either reconstruction or augmentation purposes were felt to be overly lengthy and confusing,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd Pusic urged consumers to consider the FDA\u2019s new recommendations within the larger context of risks and benefits surrounding such procedures. Breast implants, particularly in cases of post-mastectomy reconstruction, can boost a woman\u2019s body image and quality of life, she said.\n\n\u201cThe more we can ensure that systematically women are being informed of the risks and benefits of surgery, that\u2019s good,\u201d Pusic added.\n\nImplant patients would not actually see the boxed warning, because they don\u2019t typically interact with an implant\u2019s device packaging, Pusic said. So it\u2019s important that the woman get information on risks and benefits early on, when she\u2019s discussing the procedure with her doctor during a consultation.\n\nAsked about how the boxed warning might help inform patients, an FDA spokeswoman said, \u201cThe patient checklist contains the same info as in the boxed warning. So the patient would check off item by item.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Allergan, a leading breast-implant manufacturer, told MarketWatch in a statement: \u201cAllergan fully supports ensuring patients are informed about the risks and benefits of breast implants. Allergan will continue to work with the FDA to ensure patient materials are clear and informative.\u201d\n\nMentor, a Johnson & Johnson JNJ, -0.04% subsidiary that makes breast implants, recently launched a new patient website with an \u201cenhanced safety section,\u201d a company spokeswoman said. \u201cThough Mentor is still reviewing the proposed draft guidance in detail, we look forward to actively participating in the discussion on the proposed guidance,\u201d she added.\n\nAnd a spokeswoman for the manufacturer Ideal Implant said that the company \u201cwill always adhere to the guidelines the FDA requires.\u201d \u201cWe did participate in the FDA hearings and listened to the women reporting various types of health issues related to every type of implant,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have advocated for stronger long-term incident reporting on all breast implants to allow women to make more educated decisions based on the scientific data.\u201d\n\nSientra SIEN, +0.00% \u2014 the one other manufacturer of approved breast implants in the U.S., according to the FDA \u2014 did not immediately return a request for comment on the agency\u2019s recommendations.\n\nBut Valoras feels the latest moves by the FDA could help prevent others from experiencing what she went through. \u201cI applaud the FDA for stepping up to the plate,\u201d Valoras said, \u201cand I look forward to them holding the companies accountable for proper safety testing and looking closer at the breast-implant illnesses that do occur.\u201d", "description": "\u2018There is a distinct opportunity to do more to protect women who are considering breast implants,\u2019 FDA officials said.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT873_implan_ZG_20191023133838.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
