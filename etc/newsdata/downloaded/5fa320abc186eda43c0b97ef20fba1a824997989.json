The review embargo is this Friday, 1 November.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Hideo Kojima owes Death Stranding success to his bank manager being a fan\n\nMORE: Death Stranding Bridge Baby speaks through PS4 controller\u2019s speaker reveals Hideo Kojima\n\nMORE: Death Stranding explained in massive 48 minute Tokyo Game Show demo", "description": "As the PS4 launch fast approaches, Hideo Kojima has announced a rough release date for Death Stranding on the PC.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/death-stranding-main-85f0_1572280660.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
