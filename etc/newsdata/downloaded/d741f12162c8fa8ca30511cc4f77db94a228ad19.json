REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nJust two days before the third Brexit deadline of Oct. 31 will be missed despite Johnson\u2019s \u201cdo or die\u201d promise to deliver on the divorce on that date, his bid to hold an election before the end of this year was approved by 438 to 20 votes in the House of Commons.\n\nThe first Christmas-season election in Britain since 1923 will be hard to call.\n\nBrexit has variously fatigued and enraged swathes of voters while eroding traditional loyalties to the two major parties, Johnson\u2019s Conservatives and Labour.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to unite the country and get Brexit done,\u201d Johnson told a meeting of Conservative lawmakers late on Tuesday shortly after securing an election to cheers from a parliament he said had stopped him delivering Brexit.\n\nJohnson, 55, hopes to win a majority to push through the last-minute Brexit deal he struck this month with the European Union while his main opponent, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, is pitching a radical socialist government and another EU referendum.\n\nThe election result will be announced on Friday Dec. 13. If no party wins conclusively, the future of Brexit will be thrown up in the air again with options ranging from a tumultuous no-deal exit to another referendum that could scupper the whole divorce.\n\nCorbyn cast the election as a chance for real change. He frames Labour as a socialist alternative to the inequality and close relations with U.S. President Donald Trump that he says characterise Johnson\u2019s premiership.\n\n\u201cA Labour government will be on your side, while Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives \u2013 who think they\u2019re born to rule \u2013 will only look after the privileged few,\u201d Corbyn, 70, said.\n\nHe promised to nationalise rail, water and energy companies while taxing high earners to fund public services.\n\nConservative lawmaker Robert Halfon said that beside Brexit, domestic issues would play large.\n\nJohnson told lawmakers he was going \u201cto take the argument to Corbyn on One nation policies - spending on schools and hospitals and police... It wasn\u2019t just about Brexit,\u201d Halfon said.\n\nWhen Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May, bet on an early election in 2017, she lost her slender majority - a failure that ultimately prevented her from ratifying her Brexit deal in parliament and sank her political career.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Conservatives are ahead of Labour by an average of about 10 percentage points in polls this month, though pollsters underestimated the support for Brexit in 2016 and admit that the models they use are wilting beside the Brexit furnace.\n\nBoth major parties will have to fight on at least three fronts: against each other while the Brexit Party led by Nigel Farage seeks to poach Brexit voters and the Liberal Democrats seeks to win over opponents of Brexit.\n\n\u201cAt last the deadlock in parliament is broken. Brexit now has a chance to succeed,\u201d Farage said.", "description": "Britain will hold its first December election in almost a century after Prime Minister Boris Johnson finally won parliamentary approval for a gamble on a snap ballot that he hopes will break the deadlock over Brexit.", "authors": ["Alistair Smout", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446444563&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0F0", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
