There's also this element of rising purchase prices [as a result of which] landlords may want to seek higher rents in order to get better returns.\" Ms Owen said.\n\nThe latest housing construction figures on Wednesday showed a 21 per cent jump in new apartment starts in the June quarter, but economists say the home-building downturn still has further to go before it bottoms out.\n\nFurther drop to come\n\nEven so, AMP Capital's chief economist Shane Oliver said that while the 0.9 per cent drop in rents over the quarter was modest, he expected to see a further drop in Sydney.\n\n\"The problem is there is still a lot of supply to hit the property market, so things are still getting worse, but they might just be getting worse at a slower rate.\"\n\nOver the September quarter house rents were steady in Melbourne, Canberra, Adelaide and Hobart while prices grew by 1.3 per cent in Brisbane, 1 per cent in Darwin and surprisingly, the biggest rise of 1.4 per cent in Perth.\n\n\"Perth house rents have seen the strongest increase since before the collapse of the iron ore sector. An almost 6 per cent increase in Perth over the year shows demand is returning to the market,\" Ms Owen said.\n\nHobart recorded the biggest increase in unit rents over the year of 12.9 per cent, or 3.9 per cent over the quarter, making it more expensive than Brisbane and Darwin for tenants.\n\n\"In Hobart the vacancy rate was just 0.5 per cent at the end of the September quarter, that's the lowest vacancy of all the capital city markets and it represents just about 120 properties available for rent,\" Ms Owen said.", "description": "House rents in Sydney fell by 4.5 per cent over the year, while unit rents surged in Hobart.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_26/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a54ab64302deb54ca49bfe8ebb09a462b2cd2f95", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
