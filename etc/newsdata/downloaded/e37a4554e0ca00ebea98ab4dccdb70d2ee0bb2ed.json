General Assembly next week.\n\nMr. Trump also said he doesn\u2019t think he needs to tap the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve \u2014 an option he placed on the table after Saturday\u2019s attacks in Saudi Arabia disrupted oil production and increased crude prices.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I need to, but I\u2019m willing to do it. We\u2019re the undisputed champion of energy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are now way ahead of number two and three, which is Saudi Arabia and Russia.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet people do what they have to do, and they\u2019ve done it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can really step it up a lot more if we have to. So I don\u2019t believe I need to, but if we want to use strategic oil reserves, I would open them up.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration is attempting to pin down blame for the oil-field attacks over the weekend.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo is on his way to Saudi Arabia, and Vice President Mike Pence said the administration has no intention of easing off its \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran.\n\nThe unrest is occurring in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to part ways with his national security adviser, John Bolton, who pushed for a hard line against Iran.\n\nMr. Trump said he\u2019s narrowed his list of possible replacements to five candidates: Robert O\u2019Brien, Rick Waddell, Lisa E. Gordon-Hagerty, Fred Fleitz and Keith Kellogg.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
