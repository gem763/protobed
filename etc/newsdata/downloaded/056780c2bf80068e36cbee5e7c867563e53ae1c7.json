Jim Jordan (R-OH) on Saturday posed a series of questions to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) regarding the partisan-fueled impeachment inquiry, asking why she is \u201cscared to have a vote to open an official impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nPelosi told impeachment-hungry Democrats over the summer that they needed to wait and \u201cfollow the facts\u201d before pursuing impeachment.\n\n\u201cWe do believe that it\u2019s important to follow the facts. We believe that no one is above the law, including the president of the United States. And we believe the president of the United States is engaged in a cover-up,\u201d she told reporters after meeting with House Democrats in June.\n\nThe speaker reiterated her position of waiting for the \u201cfacts\u201d during a caucus-wide call in August, telling her colleagues, \u201cThe public isn\u2019t there on impeachment.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your voice and constituency, but give me the leverage I need to make sure that we\u2019re ready and it is as strong as it can be,\u201d she said.\n\nJordan, ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, posed a series of questions Saturday afternoon on Twitter regarding the House Democrats\u2019 support of an impeachment inquiry, noting that Pelosi opted to announce the inquiry without having or examining sufficient facts.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of noise since @SpeakerPelosi decided to call for impeachment before having the facts. Here are a few important questions,\u201d Jordan tweeted.\n\nHis questions are as follows:\n\nWhy did the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d write an 800+ word memo describing President Trump and [Ukrainian] President Zelensky\u2019s call based on second-hand information gleaned from a conversation that lasted just a few minutes?\n\nWhy did the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d wait 18 days to file the complaint after describing the call as \u201cfrightening\u201d in their memo?\n\nWhy and when did the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d communicate with @RepAdamSchiff \u2019s staff before filing the complaint?\n\nWhy did the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d hide from the ICIG that they met with @repadamschiff \u2019s staff by not checking the box on the whistleblower form indicating they had spoken to Congress?\n\nWhy didn\u2019t @RepAdamSchiff tell us his staff had met with the \u201cwhistleblower?\u201d\n\nWhy didn\u2019t the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d just give his memo to the Inspector General, instead of a seven page complaint dressed up with extraneous citations and media references?\n\nWhy is @RepAdamSchiff holding hearings, depositions, and interviews behind closed doors?\n\nWhy won\u2019t @RepAdamSchiff release the transcripts of these interviews, instead of leaking cherry-picked information that fits his narrative?\n\nnarrative? Why won\u2019t @RepAdamSchiff take questions from the press after these interviews, like Republicans have done?\n\n@RepAdamSchiff take questions from the press after these interviews, like Republicans have done? Why does @SpeakerPelosi think we need to \u201cstrike while the iron is hot,\u201d instead of taking time for serious and thorough investigative fact-finding?\n\nWhy is @SpeakerPelosi scared to have a vote to open an official impeachment inquiry like it\u2019s been done every other time?\n\nWhy do Democrats keep making up the rules as they go along, instead of following a fair process?\n\nWhat work did the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d do with a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate?\n\nWhy did the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d write an 800+ word memo describing President Trump and President Zelensky\u2019s call based on second-hand information gleaned from a conversation that lasted just a few minutes? \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhy and when did the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d communicate with @RepAdamSchiff\u2019s staff before filing the complaint? \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhy didn\u2019t @RepAdamSchiff tell us his staff had met with the \u201cwhistleblower?\u201d \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhy is @RepAdamSchiff holding hearings, depositions, and interviews behind closed doors? \u2014 Rep.

Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhat work did the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d do with a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate? \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nWhy don\u2019t Democrats trust the American people to choose the President? The election is less than 13 months away. \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 12, 2019\n\nJordan slammed House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff (D-CA) on Wednesday for keeping key aspects of the inquiry under wraps.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to try to get the facts and figure out more about what took place with this whole complaint and when it started and continue to tell the American people the truth,\u201d Jordan said, according to TownHall.\n\n\u201cThere were 67 pages of text messages. Adam Schiff took a few of those text messages and released them. Release them all, release them all, and more importantly release the entire transcript,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about impeaching the President of the United States thirteen months before an election based on an anonymous whistleblower with no firsthand knowledge who has a bias against the President,\u201d he added.", "description": "Rep.
