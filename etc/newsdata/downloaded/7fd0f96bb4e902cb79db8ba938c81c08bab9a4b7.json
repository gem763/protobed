I started being concerned after Mabuya told me that the chairperson and the deputy chairperson were behind a proposal to invest the surplus funds with VBS.\u201d\n\nMabuya, who was suspended along with Letele in August last year, told City Press last week that Mehana and Memani had exerted pressure on him to invest in VBS.\n\n\u201cIt is true. They did put pressure on me to invest in VBS. That is why we invested there.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that Memani kept demanding to know how much in levies the CSOS had collected from body corporates.\n\n\u201cShe demanded information about finances. She wanted to know when we were investing, in VBS in particular. One day she summoned me to her house and introduced me to a VBS agent. She stressed why it was important that we invest at VBS.\u201d\n\nI never pressured the former CFO to invest in VBS. All I can say is that Mabuya was always shifting blame whenever he was cornered with questions. Nomazotsho Memani\n\nMemani denied the claim, saying that the VBS agent was introduced to her by Mabuya.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that I was the chairperson of the finance committee. Mabuya must just tell the truth. Why did he deposit the money into an FNB account?\n\n\u201cI never pressured the former CFO to invest in VBS. All I can say is that Mabuya was always shifting blame whenever he was cornered with questions.\u201d\n\nApproached with the allegations, Mehana said: \u201cThat is total nonsense. Why did she [Letele] keep quiet all along. They [Letele and Mabuya] have made statements. What evidence do they have that I pressurised Themba [Mabuya]. Do they have an email or something to that effect?\u201d\n\nDocuments seen by City Press show that Mabuya first made the allegation that Memani put him under pressure to invest in VBS in November last year when the probe into the bank started.\n\nMemani had responded by threatening to sue Mabuya if he did not withdraw the allegation.\n\nMabuya did not withdraw the allegation. Memani said her term ended and she left CSOS.\n\nThe court ruled that the application was not urgent.\n\nLetele and Mabuya were subjected to a disciplinary hearing in March. Letele said the hearing found that the CSOS did not have powers to discipline them as they were appointed by the department, and not its board.\n\nMabuya\u2019s contract lapsed at the end of March and he is now challenging his former employer at the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration.\n\nIn response to her court challenge, human settlements director general Mbulelo Tshangana accused Letele of employing delaying tactics which saved her from \u201cfacing disciplinary inquiry and a finding of guilt\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt [the court application] is a continuation of Letele\u2019s frolics, which has seen her taking opportunistic technical points to ward off the attempts to discipline her. Her intention is to force the [department\u2019s] hand \u2026 to offer her the position of chief ombud, despite her misconduct and her failure to perform her duties with diligence while acting in that position. This has to be rejected.\u201d\n\nTHE COVER-UP\n\nA status update report published by the CSOS in July, reveals that R80 million was withdrawn from the FNB account between August and December last year.\n\nBut Anoosh Rooplal, appointed by the Reserve Bank to take care of business when VBS was placed under curatorship in March last year, disputed this.\n\nRooplal\u2019s spokesperson, Louise Brugman, said records show that the money was withdrawn from the FNB account a few hours after being deposited \u2013 on both occasions.\n\n\u201cThe funds were transferred out of the accounts well before VBS was placed under curatorship,\u201d Brugman said.\n\nIn January, the CSOS lodged an urgent court application to compel FNB to freeze the VBS account.\n\nThe court dismissed the application, saying it was not urgent since the money was no longer in the account.\n\nA source close to the matter told City Press that the CSOS was aware that the money was no longer in the account when it lodged the application.\n\n\u201cIt was a grandstanding exercise aimed at fooling the public into thinking that the CSOS was concerned about the loss. That money was stolen with the full knowledge of a few people in the former board.\u201d\n\nThe report shows that in March, the CSOS laid a criminal charge against \u201cthe persons concerned\u201d.\n\nThe CSOS\u2019 acting head Ndivhuo Rabuli said they had taken various steps to recover the money.\n\n\u201cThe board has taken various steps to locate and recover the monies and hold those persons found to have been culpable accountable,\u201d Rabuli said.\n\nLetele, according to Tshangana\u2019s papers, also sought a condonation of the irregular and unlawful investments from the department.\n\nFIGHT FOR TOP JOB\n\nIn her application, Letele argues that the department of human settlement\u2019s decision to re-advertise her post is wrong as she still occupies the position.\n\nIn February last year, in a post-Cabinet briefing, government announced that Letele had been appointed as CSOS\u2019 chief ombud.\n\nFollowing the VBS scandal, in June last year former human settlements minister Nomaindia Mfeketo froze Letele\u2019s appointment, pending an investigation by SizweNtsalubaGobodo Grant Thornton, into financial irregularities, including the VBS investments.\n\nIn July this year the CSOS\u2019s chairperson Mthobi Tyamzashe, wrote to new Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, asking for permission to appoint a new ombud.\n\nHe said Letele had been implicated in financial irregularities by two forensic reports \u2013 one by SNG Grant Thornton and another by Knowles Hussain Lindsey attorneys, which had been appointed by Mehana\u2019s board following the VBS investments.\n\nHowever, in October last year Mfeketo raised concerns about the probe instituted by Mehana and his board. She appointed SNG Grant Thornton to conduct another probe, the findings of which have not been released to the public.\n\nIn her court papers, Letele argues that Mfeketo did not have the powers to place her appointment on hold.\n\nIn his replying affidavit, Tshangana argues that while Cabinet may have announced Letele\u2019s appointment, only the minister had the powers to make the appointment and sign the contract.\n\nThis did not happen.\n\nHe also argued that Letele\u2019s contract with the department, from where she had been seconded to the CSOS in March 2017, expired in April this year.", "description": "The ANC\u2019s controversial chaplain general Reverend Vukile Mehana has been accused of putting pressure on officials of a government\u2019s statutory body to invest money in the now defunct VBS.", "authors": ["Sipho Masondo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/94/5fc4cf0ac8944649b219a7b5b289735f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
