We have to be ruthless away from home and you have to be clinical in attack.\n\n\u201cOur home form is fantastic but to win our away games we have to be more aggressive and more solid so that we do not concede easy goals.\u201d\n\nEverton began strongly in the south-coast sunshine with Calvert-Lewin being denied by a brave save from Aaron Ramsdale and Brazilian Richarlison unleashing a dipping pile-driver that thudded against the angle of post and crossbar but minutes later Bournemouth were ahead.\n\nEverton keeper Jordan Pickford made a smart save, tipping over Dominic Solanki\u2019s strike.\n\nBut from a corner Everton allowed Solanki to connect with a glancing header that was then sliced up in the air by team mate Josh King and Wilson was well placed to head it in.\n\nRicharlison was a continual danger to Bournemouth and his superb cross was headed home by a towering Calvert-Lewin in the 44th minute to restore parity.\n\nBournemouth were again indebted to Ramsdale after the break as he denied Gylfi Sigurdsson.\n\nThe hosts went back in front though when substitute Fraser\u2019s dangerous delivery into the area should have been hacked clear by Delph but the former Manchester City midfielder opted to use his wrong leg and sliced past a helpless Pickford.\n\nIf that was bad, Bournemouth\u2019s third goal was embarrassing for Everton\u2019s defence who were caught out by a hopeful ball forward and Wilson advanced alone before shooting confidently home.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nBournemouth boss Eddie Howe said it had been a vital three points for his side.\n\n\u201cPsychologically, it was hugely important to win that first home game which is why today was a huge moment in our season,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCallum [Wilson] took his goals really well and he pressed really well. He was an all-round threat and his second goal was a brilliant finish.\u201d", "description": "Callum Wilson scored twice for Bournemouth as they enjoyed a 3-1 home victory over a defensively fragile Everton side to move into mid-table in the Premier League on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430175358&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0O1", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
