He said two of the Peshtigo\u2019s crewmen were lost, while survivors were rescued by another passing schooner.\n\nThe shipwrecks were lost to history.\n\nONE OF THE LAST US WARSHIPS SUNK BY A GERMAN SUB DURING WWII REVEALS ITS SECRETS IN EERIE IMAGES FROM SEABED\n\nThat is until diver Bernie Hellstrom, 63, of Boyne City, Michigan, came across to an obstruction on his depth sounder about 200 feet down to the bottom of Lake Michigan near Beaver Island about 10 years ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made hundreds of trips to Beaver Island and every trip I go out the sounder is on,\u201d he told the AP on Friday. \u201cBut if you happen to see something that\u2019s not normal, you go back.

What he found was the two ships lost to history.\n\nThe Peshtigo and St. Andrews were about 10 feet apart with their masts atop one another. The hull of one of the ships has a huge gash.\n\nSHIPWRECK OF CAPTAIN JAMES COOK'S 'ENDEAVOUR' POSSIBLY DISCOVERED OFF RHODE ISLAND, RESEARCHERS BELIEVE\n\nHellstrom brought technical divers in to record video of the wrecks and Baillod was recruited to help them identify the ships.\n\nAccording to historians, an estimated 6,000 shipwrecks sit on the bottoms of the Great Lakes. It had actually believed for many years that the Peshtigo and St. Andrews were two ships that sank farther east in Lake Huron.\n\nWayne Lusardi, Michigan\u2019s state maritime archeologist, told the AP that finding the actual resting place of the two ships was a \u201cfantastic discovery.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can argue that any new discovery is important because it really gives you a first-time look at something that has been lost and missing for such a long time,\u201d he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe added that the two ships \u201chad been mistakenly identified as two vessels up in the Straits (of Mackinac) for decades.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, it begs the question: What are those wrecks?\u201d Lusardi said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Two Civil War-era\u00a0schooners that collided and sank into Lake Michigan more than 140 years ago were found thanks to a diver and maritime history buff looking for shipwrecks.", "authors": ["Lucia Suarez Sang"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/AP19263787126241.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
