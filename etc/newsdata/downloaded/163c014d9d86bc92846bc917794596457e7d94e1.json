At 4 370ml/d, everyone has supply and in the past few months, we have been operating at this demand level,\" said Mohale.\n\nHe added the current demand at 4 900ml/d was 530ml/d more than what was required.\n\nMohale said the current demand was unsustainable and would result in water supply interruptions.\n\n\"This is aimed at ensuring equitable supply and system stability. Consumers too must also play their part by using water sparingly and protecting this vital commodity.
