REUTERS/Javier Verdin /File Photo\n\nMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Murders in Mexico jumped in the first half of the year to the highest on record, according to official data, underscoring the vast challenges President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador faces in reducing violence in the cartel-ravaged country.\n\nThere were 14,603 murders from January to June, versus the 13,985 homicides registered in the first six months of 2018, according to data posted over the weekend on the website of Mexico\u2019s national public security office.\n\nMexico is on course to surpass the 29,111 murders of last year, an all-time high.\n\nFor years Mexico has struggled with violence as consecutive governments battled brutal drug cartels, often by taking out their leaders. That has resulted in the fragmentation of gangs and increasingly vicious internecine fighting.\n\nVeteran leftist Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, has blamed the economic policies of previous administrations for exacerbating the violence and said his government was targeting the issue by rooting out corruption and inequality in Mexico.\n\n\u201cSocial policies are very important - we agree they\u2019ll have positive effects. But these positive effects will be seen in the long term,\u201d said Francisco Rivas, director of the National Citizen Observatory, a civil group that monitors justice and security in Mexico.\n\nThe complexity of fighting criminal groups is a major test for Lopez Obrador\u2019s young administration, which has vowed to try a different approach than that of his predecessor.\n\nHis administration last month launched a new militarized National Guard police force tasked with helping to fix the problem.", "description": "Murders in Mexico jumped in the first half of the year to the highest on record, according to official data, underscoring the vast challenges President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador faces in reducing violence in the cartel-ravaged country.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190721&t=2&i=1410515969&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF6K0RW", "published_at": "2019-07-21"}
