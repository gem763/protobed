MetaProp has invested in the coworking operator Spacious, which WeWork bought last month.\n\nFinegold highlighted WeWork CEO and avid surfer Adam Neumann's 2016 purchase of a wave-pool company as a particularly egregious example of WeWork's governance leading the company astray. He thinks the governance practices are indicative of \"something about the core values of the company.\"\n\n\"When a company is acting this way, I don't really care what they print on their T-shirts,\" Finegold said.\n\nOne day before the changes in governance were announced, Finegold said he would need to see a \"total and fundamental\" change to feel confident.\n\nFinegold was also concerned by WeWork's switch toward enterprise businesses, which now make up 40% of its members, according to the company.\n\nConventional wisdom in the space holds that demand from enterprise customers is more stable than that from startups and small businesses. Still, Finegold doesn't think that means big businesses are necessarily more stable customers.\n\nAccording to Finegold, enterprise businesses are often using flexible office space for special products and to expand without making a long-term lease commitment. This makes their use of WeWork, which is more expensive per head for a large business than a traditional lease, temporary by nature.\n\n\"A recession could obviously cull this \u2026 even in a continued expansion. At some point, they're going to start saying that they've stabilized,\" Finegold said. WeWork's flexible lease lengths could quickly become a disadvantage.\n\nFinegold also noticed that WeWork's S-1 allocated very little for depreciation, which could be a big risk for a company that fits five times as many people into a space as a typical office. The company's focus on current design trends may be an asset in attracting customers now but could also mean high costs a decade from now if they want to keep up with the trends.\n\n\"They provide a product that is super hip, of the moment, highly utilized, and to people who, if it were a car, would say it's just a rental and would hit the curb,\" Finegold said.", "description": "The people we talked to credited WeWork with showing that office space could be a brand but blasted the company's governance, model, and CEO.", "authors": ["Alex Nicoll"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7c12412e22af0a962cf3f5-1136-568.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
