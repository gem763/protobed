We\u2019re trying to make sure the museum remains publicly accessible,\u201d said Mayor Justin Wilson (D). \u201cWe\u2019re willing to work with any partner that can make that happen.\u201d\n\nThe local Urban League\u2019s board chair, Diane McLaughlin, declined multiple requests for comment.\n\nFrom the outside, 1315 Duke St. looks like an ordinary four-story rowhouse \u2014 except for the historic marker that hints at its chilling history. Between 1828 and 1836, it served as headquarters for Franklin and Armfield, at the time the richest and most successful slave traders in the country.\n\nAD\n\nThey were once America\u2019s cruelest, richest slave traders. Why does no one know their names?\n\nAfter being herded off boats at the city\u2019s port and marched to the property, enslaved people were held in the dingy basement or in cells behind the house before being forced to walk in chains or sail on packed ships to bondage, primarily in Mississippi and Louisiana. John Armfield lived above the squalid quarters, where the local Urban League now has its offices.\n\nOnce Armfield and Isaac Franklin closed their company, other slave-trading firms operated there until Union troops arrived in Alexandria in 1861. Those soldiers found a lone black man still chained by the leg in the basement.\n\nAD\n\nIt is the nation\u2019s original sin. But few schools teach much about it.\n\nThe small museum, which includes shackles and recordings of slave narratives, is open only on Friday and Saturday afternoons and attracts about 300 visitors a month paying $5 each, according to Gretchen Bulova, the director of the Office of Historic Alexandria.\n\nAD\n\nThe Northern Virginia Urban League, one of 94 affiliates of the national organization, focuses its efforts on providing scholarships and services. In 2018, then-board chair Tracey Walker said that the organization nearly defaulted on its $1.5 million mortgage in 2017 but worked out a temporary accommodation with the bank. The city provided a $63,000 interest-free loan to stabilize finances in early 2018, established an entrance fee and sent city historians to operate weekend tours.\n\nSupporters had hoped a revitalized museum could capi\u00adtal\u00adize on the surge of interest in African American history that followed the opening of the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture \u2014 particularly this year, the 400th anniversary of when slaves were first brought to the U.S. mainland.\n\nAD\n\nBut the museum shut down for three weekends this summer after a heavy rainstorm flooded the basement. Bulova said the city paid to pump out three inches of water, tear out the flooring and repair damage to the exhibits.\n\nAD\n\nThe building\u2019s finances still appear precarious. Property taxes, about $19,000 per year, have been unpaid for past three years, according to city records. Alexandria City Manager Mark B. Jinks estimated the house needs at least $2 million to $3 million in repairs.\n\nFormer treasurer Muriel Garr, who left the board of the Northern Virginia Urban League last year, said the group\u2019s membership voted in the spring to sell the property because it was not part of the league\u2019s core mission. She also said that while she held the treasurer\u2019s office, the mortgage was paid on time.\n\nMcLaughlin declined to answer questions about the group\u2019s finances.\n\n\u2018Like we descended from Hitler\u2019: Coming to terms with a slave-trading past\n\nLyn Hoyt, an indirect descendant of Franklin who has joined other relatives in trying to reconcile his slave-trading past, said she hopes the building will be purchased by an entity willing to operate it \u201cas a museum that recognizes its historical significance.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe hate to see the Urban League have to give it up,\u201d she said. \u201cA sustainable solution is what we would hope for in order to establish the Freedom House permanently as a place that matters in the bigger national discussion around our country\u2019s enslavement history.\u201d\n\nThe real estate advertisement for the house describes its \u201chistoric charm\u201d and \u201cwalkable amenities.\u201d It does not mention the historic easement, which requires that the public have access to it once a year and will remain in place even if the building is sold. Nor does it picture the basement, where the names, ages, occupations and sale prices of slaves once held there are painted on the walls.\n\nMichael Porterfield, the real estate agent handling the sale, said the property would be a good investment for someone seeking a historic building, despite its ties to \u201can ugly chapter in our country\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA couple of associations have expressed interest, but none have toured the house so far, Porterfield said. There\u2019s a \u201ca fair amount of deferred maintenance . . . and old buildings are expensive to run,\u201d he added.\n\nJinks, the city manager, said he expects the city to determine its next steps by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from the public . . . the museum needs to remain open,\u201d Jinks said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more [history] to tell.\u201d\n\nHistoric mansion on land owned by George Washington set to be demolished\n\nShe was captured, enslaved 400 years ago.
