Now, after reading the speech, Anderson believes the attorney general, in revealing his devotion to an especially conservative branch of Catholicism, is a \u201cthreat to American democracy\u201d.\n\nHe described the speech as a \u201cdog whistle\u201d to ultra-conservative Catholics who, he says, have aligned themselves to Donald Trump in a campaign to limit the rights of LGBTQ Americans, immigrants and non-Christians, especially Muslims, and to criminalize almost all abortions. \u201cThe attorney general is taking positions that are essentially un-Democratic\u201d because they demolish the wall between church and state, Anderson said.\n\nRelated: US justice department resumes use of death penalty and schedules five executions\n\nIn the hallways of the justice department in Washington, there has been a similar furor among some Catholics employees who answer to Barr. \u201cI was shocked by the speech and all this fire and brimstone,\u201d said a senior department career official who considers himself a devout Catholic, speaking on condition that he not be identified for fear of losing his job.\n\n\u201cAt least it helps me understand why Barr has been so willing to put his own reputation on the line to defend Trump so fiercely in every battle,\u201d beginning with the congressional investigation that is likely to end in the president\u2019s impeachment, he said. \u201cTrump is Barr\u2019s imperfect vessel in serving a much higher cause: the gospel.\u201d\n\nIn the speech, delivered to an invitation-only crowd at Notre Dame, one of the nation\u2019s largest and best known Catholic universities, the attorney general described threats to religious freedom.\n\nHe warned that Catholicism and other mainstream religions were the target of \u201corganized destruction\u201d by \u201csecularists and their allies among progressives who have marshalled all the force of mass communications, popular culture, the entertainment industry and academia\u201d.\n\nHe insisted that \u201cthe traditional Judeo-Christian moral system\u201d of the United States was under siege by \u201cmodern secularists\u201d who were responsible for every sort of \u201csocial pathology\u201d, including drug abuse, rising suicide rates and illegitimacy.\n\nBarr did not address the fact that many of the policies of the Trump administration are strongly opposed by the Vatican. Pope Francis has repeatedly pleaded for the United States to open its doors to more refugees, even as Barr has defended policies that turn away or imprison immigrants seeking refugee status at the US-Mexico border, even separating parents from their children.\n\nThe reaction to Barr\u2019s address came as another Trump cabinet member, secretary of state Mike Pompeo, was drawing fire from civil liberties groups over the state department\u2019s decision this week to promote his recent speech titled Being a Christian Leader on the department\u2019s online homepage.\n\nThe speech by Pompeo, an evangelical Christian, was delivered on Friday, the same day as Barr\u2019s speech, to a meeting of the American Association of Christian Counselors in Nashville.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly fine for secretary Pompeo to be a leader who is a Christian,\u201d the group Americans United for Separation of Church and State said in a statement. But the decision to promote Pompeo\u2019s speech on the department\u2019s official website sends \u201cthe clear message that US public policy will be guided by his personal religious beliefs\u201d.\n\nBarr\u2019s speech at Notre Dame was a reminder of a fact often overlooked in analysis of Trump\u2019s political base \u2013 that while the president enjoys the support of many high-profile right-wing Christian evangelical leaders, he has also surrounded himself with conservative Roman Catholics associated with organizations that some others in the faith consider extreme.", "description": "Attorney general\u2019s recent address at Notre Dame is a \u2018dog whistle\u2019 to conservatives who have aligned themselves with TrumpWilliam Barr, US attorney general, speaks to students at the University of Notre Dame law school on 11 October.
