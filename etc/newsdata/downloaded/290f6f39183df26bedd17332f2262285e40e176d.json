The plan is currently being reviewed by the Arlington Planning Commission and will then be reviewed by the county board.\n\nAmazon had announced its plans to build its second headquarters in Virginia in 2017, about the time when the Pentagon was drafting a request for proposals from prospective bidders to build its Pentagon cloud program, known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI).\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos has been also steadily increasing his presence and influence in the area in the years prior, buying the Washington Post in 2013 and buying a home in Washington, DC, in 2016.\n\nThe company has also been increasing its donations to local politicians of both parties in recent months, according to news reports.\n\nVirginia's statehouse elections are just two months away, and Amazon is making its presence felt with $23,000 in campaign contributions. https://t.co/ZsJXUIcZC0 \u2014 Washington Business Journal (@WBJonline) October 22, 2019\n\nFriday\u2019s announcement that the contract would go to Microsoft sent Microsoft shares up three percent in after-hours trading on Friday and Amazon\u2019s stock down 0.8 percent, according to a Market Watch article on October 28.\n\nAmazon earnings fall for first time in more than two years, stock drops in late trading https://t.co/dXdUhG1Z7n pic.twitter.com/OdKe1OSh98 \u2014 West Virginia Topics (@dubvNOW) October 25, 2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big loss for [Amazon Web Services], which drives most of Amazon\u2019s profit \u2014 and a surprise, given that AWS was the favorite to win by most industry watchers,\u201d according to a Business Insider article published on Saturday.\n\nAmazon is expected to challenge the Pentagon\u2019s decision as early as next week on the basis that President Donald Trump influenced the decision by being critical of Amazon\u2019s owner Jeff Bezos, according to Reuters.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper recused himself from the decision, citing a conflict of interest because his son worked for IBM, one of the contract\u2019s earliest bidders. Esper delegated authority over the contract to Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist.\n\nHowever, Amazon is still a leader in providing cloud services, and its new headquarters will bring the company closer to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which it already provides cloud services for and has a $600 billion contract with.\n\nIn the future, Amazon will likely focus on winning cloud contracts from the CIA, which is reportedly looking to ramp up its reliance on the cloud.\n\nCurrently, Amazon is valued at $870 billion, while Microsoft is valued at $1 trillion, according to Barron\u2019s.\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019 @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Amazon decided to open a second headquarters in Virginia ahead of what was expected to be the award of a massive contract from the Pentagon.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/10/Amazon-Employee-Warehouse-Ross-D.-Franklin-file-AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
