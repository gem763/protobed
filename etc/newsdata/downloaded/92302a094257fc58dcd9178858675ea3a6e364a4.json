USA TODAY\n\nSay it ain't so, Joe.\n\nOr, say it is so, Joe.\n\nJoe Giudice and Teresa Giudice of Bravo's \"The Real Housewives of New Jersey\" sit down Sunday night with \"RHONJ\" show producer Andy Cohen at 8 p.m. ET for \u201cJoe and Teresa: Unlocked.\u201d\n\nJoe Giudice was a star of \"RHONJ,\" but he hasn't been on the show for more than four years as he's been in federal prison, for tax fraud, and in ICE custody, as an immigration court ruled Giudice was to be deported back to Italy upon the completion of his federal sentence.\n\nJoe went to Italy, the country of his birth, on Oct. 11 as he continues to appeal his deportation. That's where he talks to Cohen and Teresa from. He's wearing an orange jacket in teasers released by Bravo.\n\nWe have a few questions for Teresa and Joe that we hope will be answered on \"Unlocked\":\n\nTeresa, will you and the girls move to Italy if Joe is deported?\n\nTeresa has stated in the past that she, and their four children, will not relocate to Italy if Joe is deported.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like starting a whole new life, and (my kids) have been through so much already,\u201d said Teresa on a \u201cRHONJ\u201d reunion which aired March 6. \u201cSo, I mean, I\u2019m not doing a long-distance relationship. I\u2019m just not doing it. You know, I want somebody with me every day. And I know exactly what happens, like, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be with other women. It happens. So, if we do the long-distance thing, it\u2019s not going to work. I\u2019d be like, bye-bye.\u201d\n\nSo, Teresa, is it still \"bye-bye?\"\n\nJoe Giudice released from ICE custody, headed to Italy\n\nTeresa, do you blame Joe for your going to prison?\n\nTeresa served 11 months in federal prison for a related tax fraud charge. She hinted that Joe was to blame for her sentence, and she was angry that her being behind bars took her away during her mother's final days on the Feb. 27 \"Reunion\" show.\n\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m angry with him. I went to jail. I went to jail. Of course I\u2019m angry!\u201d Teresa said. \u201cI have a small family, I only have my brother, my mother, my father, and my four daughters. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s my family. So I\u2019m angry that I came home, eight months later, I lost my mom. I do throw it in his face when I get mad. I\u2019m like, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t have screwed up.\u2019 \"\n\nThis anger may be part of the reason they don't seem to be a happy family now.\n\nTeresa, were you faithful to Joe while he was in prison?\n\nTeresa was photographed hand-in-hand with Totowa realtor Blake Schreck, who is 20 years her junior, in February, and her camp has denied that there's anything going on since. The infidelity question is a plotline for Season 10 of \"RHONJ\" Season 10, according to the trailer.\n\nIn the teaser for \u201cUnlocked,\u201d infidelity is discussed on the edges.\n\n\"Do I feel like he was faithful?\u201d Teresa says, replying to herself, \u201cno.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were photographed with women, also,\" says Teresa to Joe.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I made it OK for you,\u201d says Joe to Teresa, implying that he thinks she cheated.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of guy friends,\u201d says Teresa.\n\n\u201cThat you hold hands with?\u201d Cohen quips.\n\nCohen wraps it up by saying: \"This relationship, it kind of seems like you're speaking about it in the past tense.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/27/teresa-giudice-joe-giudice-andy-cohen-interview/2479083001/", "description": "\"Real Housewives of New Jersey\" stars Teresa and Joe Giudice sit down Sunday night with show producer Andy Cohen to talk Joe's deportation appeal.", "authors": ["Chris Jordan", "Published P.M.
