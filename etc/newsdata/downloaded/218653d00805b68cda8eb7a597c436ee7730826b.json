The network has provided Sandy Hook Promise free air-time to showcase the public service announcement (PSA).\n\n\u201cThis is what our kids are experiencing now in school,\u201d she added. \u201cWe wanted to focus on this back-to-school time because parents still think of it as this rosy time where you're getting your staplers, shoes, folders and binders \u2026 Whereas, it's back to a time of violence for a lot of kids.\u201d\n\nThe PSA arrived amid a rise in recent years of school shooting nationwide. Last year was reportedly the worst year on record for deadly gun violence in US schools since at least 1970.\n\nStudents across the country have since staged nationwide walkouts in protest of what they describe to be a lack of gun control legislation in the wake of frequent mass shootings.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

A lot has changed since Sandy Hook,\" she said. \u201cThe recent back-to-back shootings are so heartbreaking. The conversation continues to happen. More people are getting involved. Legislation is available in Congress right now that can start to chip away at these acts of violence. Prevention, plus legislation, that's the cure to this.\"\n\nShe added: \u201cI always have hope. I absolutely know that we can prevent this \u2026 I know we can stem this tide. We just need to keep chipping away.\"", "description": "A\u00a0shocking new\u00a0advert\u00a0warns families about the persistent threat of school shootings across the United States, with a back-to-school advertisement that takes a disturbing and sadly realistic turn.", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/18/16/school-psa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
