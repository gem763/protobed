It would have been an odd time to leave town: The next day he was opening a new restaurant, the Fulton, in Lower Manhattan, on the waterfront facing Brooklyn. But Vongerichten wasn\u2019t flying anywhere. He was going to check in on another restaurant, this one opening on Wednesday, inside the new TWA Hotel at J.F.K.\n\nOpening two restaurants back to back, on consecutive days, would be impressive for a Chipotle or an In-N-Out Burger. It\u2019s absolutely unheard-of for a fine-dining chef like Vongerichten. It also wasn\u2019t part of the plan. The two openings had been years in the making, both tied up in larger redevelopment projects that the chef had no control over, so he could do little but watch as the deadlines slowly converged on each other: The opening date for the Fulton kept getting pushed back, while the other, for the Paris Caf\u00e9, didn\u2019t budge. As late as mid-April, Vongerichten still thought he would have a few days\u2019 buffer between them, but then that, too, disappeared.\n\nThe 62-year-old Vongerichten looked grumpy, or whatever grumpy turns into when it\u2019s deployed on the face of a man whose default mode is glee. He squirmed in his seat and kept glancing out the window distractedly. The developers of the TWA Hotel had only turned the Paris Caf\u00e9 kitchen over to Vongerichten the day before, which was ridiculously late. At the Fulton, the kitchen was ready six weeks before opening, and Vongerichten and his team had been training nonstop since then. The goal for both restaurants was to stage an opening night that felt like nothing of the sort, as if the restaurant had been up and running perfectly for months. At this point it looked as if only the Fulton would make it. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive pressure,\u201d Vongerichten said.\n\nThe Fulton and the Paris Caf\u00e9 would give Vongerichten 14 restaurants in New York and 38 around the world. In the time it took to report and write this article, he added two more, both in the new Four Seasons Hotel in Philadelphia. Four restaurants in three months \u2014 it\u2019s a lot, but 2019 will probably still be slower than 2017, when he opened seven, in New York, Los Angeles, Singapore, S\u00e3o Paulo and London. This pace is intentional. \u201cMy dream,\u201d he told me, \u201cwould be to open a restaurant a month and then get rid of it.\u201d", "description": "In the era of the auteur chef, Jean-Georges Vongerichten has figured out how to create high-end restaurants by the dozen.
