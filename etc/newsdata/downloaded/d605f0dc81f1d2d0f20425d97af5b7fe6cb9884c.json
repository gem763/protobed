It\u2019s like buying a fleet of planes with no pilots to fly them.\u201d\n\nEmma Greenwood, Cancer Research UK\u2019s director of policy, said: \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that so many people are diagnosed late. Although survival has improved, it\u2019s not happening fast enough. More referrals to hospital mean we urgently need more staff.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s inaction on staff shortages is crippling the NHS, failing cancer patients and the doctors and nurses who are working tirelessly to diagnose and treat them.\u201d\n\nLast year, the government pledged to have three in four cancer patients diagnosed at an early stage by 2028, which could save thousands of lives.\n\nBut Cancer Research UK warned that that means diagnosing over 100,000 more people than current levels every year \u2013 with the ageing of the population and cancer becoming more common, the number of cancer patients is expected to rise.\n\nAccording to calculations released by Cancer Research UK, by 2027 the NHS would need approximately 1,700 additional radiologists, who currently number around 3,000 in England; nearly 2,000 more therapeutic radiographers, who are currently 2,800; and to triple its number of oncologists, currently just over 1,100.\n\n\u201cBy 2035, one person every minute will be diagnosed with cancer but there\u2019s no plan to increase the number of NHS staff to cope with demand now or the growing numbers in the future,\u201d said Ms Greenwood. By that year, Cancer Research UK estimates that some 500,000 people per year will be diagnosed with cancer in the UK, compared with 360,000 today.\n\n\u201c[The government] must commit to investing in vital NHS staff now to ensure no one dies from cancer unnecessarily,\u201d Ms Greenwood added.\n\nCancer Research UK said that other factors for late diagnosis include hard-to-spot symptoms, GPs having too little time to investigate people thoroughly, low uptake of screening programmes or the cancer being advanced when detected.\n\nSaffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said: \u201cWorkforce shortages are severe. It leaves trusts struggling to ensure they have the range of specialists needed to carry out tests and report the outcomes within the expected timeframe.\n\n\u201cThe shortages of endoscopists and radiologists are particularly serious.\n\n\u201cThe NHS is committed to improving cancer care and outcomes as part of its long-term plan. But to do this, we must see investment in education and training to make sure we are safeguarding these skills within the service.\n\n\u201cWe also need to see more capital investment in the equipment needed to both diagnose and treat cancer.\u201d\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cCancer is a priority for this government \u2013 survival rates are at a record high and in the NHS Long Term Plan, we committed to detecting three-quarters of all cancers at an early stage by 2028.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by PA", "description": "About half of all cancer patients in England failed to be diagnosed with cancer in its early stages in one year, a charity has said, sounding the alarm that NHS staff shortages are contributing to a loss of life.", "authors": ["Alessio Perrone"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/26/11/boris-johnson-ambulance.jpg"}
