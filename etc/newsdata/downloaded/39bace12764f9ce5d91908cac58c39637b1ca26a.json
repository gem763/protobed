Here are a few thoughts that should help you take it to the max.\n\nCulture shock\n\nArriving in Japan there's a sense of culture shock. Everything is a bit different and however much you've prepared, it takes a while to get used to.\n\nLanguage, signs, the people may at first seem unusual but you soon come to appreciate the contrasts that make Japan such a great place to visit. Teeming streets and crowded bars are matched by serene shrines and temples right beside the main streets as little oases of calm where people refresh themselves for the day ahead.\n\nGo with the flow -- make the most of your time here but find moments to be quiet and think about it too.\n\nWhat: Kobe Misaki Stadium Capacity: 30,132 Where: Kobe City Matches: England vs USA; Scotland vs Samoa; Ireland vs Russia; South Africa vs Canada\n\nWhat: Kobe Misaki Stadium Capacity: 30,132 Where: Kobe City Matches: England vs USA; Scotland vs Samoa; Ireland vs Russia; South Africa vs Canada\n\nWhat: Oita Stadium Capacity: 40,000 Where: Oita Prefecture Matches: New Zealand vs Canada; Australia vs Uruguay; Wales vs Fiji; Quarterfinals 1 & 3\n\nWhat: Oita Stadium Capacity: 40,000 Where: Oita Prefecture Matches: New Zealand vs Canada; Australia vs Uruguay; Wales vs Fiji; Quarterfinals 1 & 3\n\nWhat: Hanazono Rugby Stadium Capacity: 32,228 Where: Higashiosaka City, Osaka Prefecture Matches: Italy vs Namibia; Argentina vs Tonga; Georgia vs Fiji; USA vs Tonga\n\nWhat: Hanazono Rugby Stadium Capacity: 32,228 Where: Higashiosaka City, Osaka Prefecture Matches: Italy vs Namibia; Argentina vs Tonga; Georgia vs Fiji; USA vs Tonga\n\nWhat: Shizuoka Stadium Ecopa Capacity: 50,889 Where: Shizuoka Prefecture Matches: Japan vs Ireland; South Africa vs Italy; Scotland vs Romania; Australia vs Georgia\n\nWhat: Shizuoka Stadium Ecopa Capacity: 50,889 Where: Shizuoka Prefecture Matches: Japan vs Ireland; South Africa vs Italy; Scotland vs Romania; Australia vs Georgia\n\nWhat: City of Toyota Stadium Capacity: 45,000 Where: Toyota, Aichi Prefecture Matches: Wales vs Georgia; South Africa vs Namibia; Japan vs Samoa; New Zealand vs Italy\n\nWhat: City of Toyota Stadium Capacity: 45,000 Where: Toyota, Aichi Prefecture Matches: Wales vs Georgia; South Africa vs Namibia; Japan vs Samoa; New Zealand vs Italy\n\nWhat: Tokyo Stadium Capacity: 49,970 Where: Tokyo Metropolitan Matches: Japan vs Romania; France vs Argentina; Australia vs Wales; England v Argentina; New Zealand vs Namibia; Quarterfinals 2 & 4; Bronze final\n\nWhat: Tokyo Stadium Capacity: 49,970 Where: Tokyo Metropolitan Matches: Japan vs Romania; France vs Argentina; Australia vs Wales; England v Argentina; New Zealand vs Namibia; Quarterfinals 2 & 4; Bronze final\n\nWhat: International Stadium Yokohama Capacity: 72,327 Where: Yokohama City, Kanagawa Prefecture Matches: New Zealand vs South Africa; Ireland vs Scotland; England vs France; Japan vs Scotland; Semifinals 1 & 2; Final\n\nWhat: International Stadium Yokohama Capacity: 72,327 Where: Yokohama City, Kanagawa Prefecture Matches: New Zealand vs South Africa; Ireland vs Scotland; England vs France; Japan vs Scotland; Semifinals 1 & 2; Final\n\nNew Zealand beat Australia 34-17 to win its second straight Rugby World Cup at Twickenham Stadium, London in October 2015. Four years on, the focus will shift to Japan, where 12 stadiums throughout the country will host the tournament from September 20 to November 2.\n\nNew Zealand beat Australia 34-17 to win its second straight Rugby World Cup at Twickenham Stadium, London in October 2015. Four years on, the focus will shift to Japan, where 12 stadiums throughout the country will host the tournament from September 20 to November 2.\n\nWelcome\n\nYou might wonder what sort of welcome you'll get in this country which seems so different. The Japanese are naturally polite, friendly and welcoming people and the fact that their call for volunteers was many times oversubscribed will mean that you get a very warm welcome both to the Rugby World Cup and to the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics.\n\nJapan's 'No-Side' volunteers are expected to match those at London 2012 which set a benchmark for major sporting events. The phrase 'No-Side' is used at the end of a match and has become a symbol of respect, hospitality and solidarity.\n\nDon't be afraid to ask for help. And to make sure of a warm welcome here are a few tips.\n\nPedestrians cross an intersection in Tokyo's Ginza district\n\nDo\n\nOpen your mind and your eyes and embrace the very different culture\n\nEnjoy the differences -- Japan is unlike anywhere else in the world\n\nLearn a few words -- as in most countries just saying please and thank you makes a positive impression\n\nBe polite and respectful of different ways of doing things -- washing your hands at shrines for example\n\nUse the wonderful convenience stores -- there are over 50,000 and they do snacks, coffee and all sorts of things you may need\n\nTravel by train as they are a phenomenon\n\nGet reception to give you a card or write the name and address of your hotel and any restaurants you plan to visit by taxi -- English is limited among taxi drivers\n\nDon't\n\nBe afraid of hi-tech loos -- a down-below wash and blow dry is amazing\n\nWorry about signs -- train, subways, major street signs are in English -- but see above with regards to addresses\n\nWear shoes indoors where there are tatami floors\n\nHot water toilet seats for sale in a Tokyo department store.\n\nEat in the street except right by the stall where you bought your street food\n\nMiss out on the experiences that await beyond the stadium -- here are a few ideas\n\nGo see\n\nApart from the match venues try to take in some quintessential aspects of Japanese culture:\n\nTake time to visit a shrine or temple or both\n\nStroll in a Japanese garden or city park\n\nRelax in a hot spring or onsen\n\nBook a karaoke session in one of the hi-tech studios\n\nFeast your eyes and your stomach in a department store food hall\n\nEat and drink in a neighborhood bar or izakaya they are much more fun than the standard restaurants, good as those may be with more Michelin stars than any other country.\n\nJUST WATCHED Rugby in Japan: Japan's rugby Mecca Replay More Videos ...

Oh and it's not all about raw fish although sashimi is one of my favorite dishes.\n\nTry set meals -- many places offer these combination trays with rice, pickles, soup and a main dish\n\nDrink some sake -- you may need advice as there are many types. The higher the positive number, the drier the sake.\n\nLook out for craft beer outlets -- it's a fast growing sector in Japan and very good beers abound\n\nEat noodles -- ramen, soba, udon all delicious inexpensive meals with many sauces and toppings\n\nTry to find some okonomiyaki -- a kind of pancake cooked in front of you it's delicious and fun\n\nIn the street takoyaki (octopus balls), yakitori (chicken skewers), gyoza (dumplings), dorayaki (pancakes), senbei (rice crackers) and mochi (sweet rice cakes) are all well worth a try\n\nHida beef soba noodles\n\nSport\n\nThe Japanese enjoy their sport. They love the success that Kei Nishikori and Naomi Osaka are having in tennis. Baseball is the big one with players switching to and from the USA major leagues.\n\nThey are proud that the Samurai Blue have been at the last six FIFA World Cups and they are mad for sumo wrestling and golf.\n\nLos Angeles Angels' Shohei Ohtani has been dubbed the Japanese Babe Ruth\n\nRugby is growing fast and will become really big with Japan being the first Asian country to host the World Cup. It already has over 3,600 clubs and with 125,000, the fourth largest number of players of any country.\n\nIt's appropriate that the first recorded game was in Yokohama in 1866 where this year's final will be held. An early version of the game called kemari played from about 600 AD using a ball made of deerskin with the hair facing inside and the hide on the outside.\n\nJapanese players celebrate defeating South Africa at the 2015 Rugby World Cup\n\nLocations\n\nAll the venues are in great stadiums and in interesting cities. Sapporo on the northern island of Hokkaido which hosted the 1976 Winter Olympics is a lively city with great shopping, eating and nightlife.\n\nKamaishi has a brand new stadium built as part of its recovery from the tsunami of 2011. It's in the north of Honshu, the main island in a city set amid fabulous coastal scenery.\n\nTokyo\n\nTokyo is a city with so much to do and see it's hard to know where to start but here are a few things you shouldn't miss.\n\nGo up the Tokyo Skytree and see the metropolis from the air, it's breathtaking. Alternatively do the same from the Metropolitan Government Building in Shinjuku, it's free and on a good day you can see Mount Fuji. Stay on in Shinjuku for the neon extravaganzas of Kabuchiko Street and the thousands of bars, restaurants and clubs in the streets surrounding the world's busiest railway station.\n\nJUST WATCHED Rugby in Japan: Cherry blossoms rise up Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Rugby in Japan: Cherry blossoms rise up 03:16\n\nCross the road in Shibuya at the famous scramble crossing where 3000 people cross the junction at each change of lights at busy times.\n\nAfter the hustle of the busier parts of Tokyo spend some time in the peaceful surroundings of the Meiji Shrine or in the north of the city very close to the Skytree, visit the Senso-ji Temple at Asakusa with access via the crowded and fascinating stalls of Nakamise Street.\n\nJapan is famed for its gardens. You can experience these in Tokyo as well by going to the Shinjuku Gyoen which has a traditional Japanese, French and English gardens all in the middle of one of the busiest parts of the city. Other great parks are Hibiya, Ueno and the Imperial Place East Garden.\n\nKansai\n\nThe region south of Tokyo is called the Kansai and here you'll find the venues in Osaka, Japan's third-largest city, and Kobe.\n\nBoth are great port cities with excellent food, shopping -- Osaka has the longest indoor shopping street, Tenjinbashi, in Japan -- visitor attractions and entertainment.\n\nJUST WATCHED Rugby in Japan: Michael Leitch exclusive Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Rugby in Japan: Michael Leitch exclusive 02:07\n\nKyushu\n\nThere are three venues on the most southerly of the four main islands. It'll be warm down here in September. Like most of the country Kyushu is very mountainous with the active volcano Mount Aso, last eruption 2016, in the center. Kyushu grows 60% of all Japan's bamboo and they use a lot of it.\n\nThe venues are further north with Fukuoka a busy city with excellent shopping, eating and interesting museums. It's full of sea air and green spaces, friendly, safe and clean.\n\nOita is on the east coast looking across to Shikoku and Honshu. It is in the highly prized area for hot springs centered on Beppu so don't miss a chance to get in the hot tub. Oita is also famous for toriten -- southern fried chicken -- so try that in an izakaya.\n\nSmoke rises from Mount Aso, Japan's largest active volcano.\n\nKumamoto is a bit further inland and surrounded by mountains. It has one of Japan's best castles, a former samurai mansion and the peaceful Suizenji garden which includes the old route from Kyoto to Tokyo and a miniature Mount Fuji.\n\nThe town has two extensive examples of shopping arcades which are a feature of so many towns with chain and individual stores, coffee shops and bars. The city had huge success with a bear mascot it launched in 2010 so you are bound to come across Kumamon.\n\nTaboo Tattoo\n\nYou may not see many of these. Players have been asked, and have agreed, to cover up tattoos, although some public places are considering relaxing this policy during the World Cup\n\nJapan has a long tradition of intricate tattoos but in the 1960s they became associated with crime syndicates known as yakuza and since then everyone else avoids tattoos or keeps them covered up in public.\n\nTattoos are popular amongst Oceanian rugby players, including All Blacks star Sonny Bill Williams\n\nMore than half of the hot springs and resort hotels ban people with visible tattoos from using their facilities. It's a case of 'when in Rome' respecting local preferences when it comes to showing off your tatts.\n\nAnd finally\n\nIt may seem weird at times and it's certainly wonderful so just embrace the differences and enjoy a great experience of sport, cuisine and culture.", "description": "If you're off to Japan for the Rugby World Cup or thinking about making the trip, here are a few thoughts that should help you take it to the max.", "authors": ["Mike Raggett", "For Cnn"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190315154129-rugby-world-cup-travel-guide-mount-fuji-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-01"}
