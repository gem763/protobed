The Washington Post is still covering itself with glory in the form of this absurd piece published Friday evening. It\u2019s impossible to ridicule something this silly so I\u2019ll just quote it:\n\nNiquel Johnson paid for three drinks in Philadelphia on Sunday, and in typical Starbucks fashion, an employee asked for his name. Johnson, 40, told them \u201cAziz,\u201d his Islamic name pronounced ah-zeez. He has used it for 25 years \u2014 and \u201ccountless\u201d times at that particular store. But three unusual things happened on this occasion, he said. When his order was ready, a staffer announced them by drink type, not his name. The second unusual part was the employee wrote his name as \u201cISIS\u201d \u2014 the acronym for the Islamic terror group \u2014 in the printout attached to all three drinks\u2026 \u201cI was shocked and angry. I felt it was discrimination,\u201d Johnson told The Washington Post on Friday.\n\nThe backstory here is that a year ago a Starbucks manager in Philadelphia called the police on two black customers who used the bathroom and then sat without ordering. That led to a boycott and Starbucks\u2019 CEO apologized and ordered all 8,000 stores to hold mandatory bias training. The incident was a very bad moment for the company. But so far, Starbucks is saying that they don\u2019t believe this incident involved any bias: \u201cAfter investigating, we don\u2019t believe this was a case of discrimination or profiling. The customer approached and provided the name Aziz. The barista mistakenly spelled it incorrectly.\u201d\n\nThat sounds like a pretty reasonable explanation to me. The barista misheard the name and put down ISIS. After all, it\u2019s not exactly unheard of for Starbucks baristas to get someone\u2019s name wrong. Now, if Johnson had said his name was \u201cNiquel\u201d and the cup said \u201cISIS\u201d then maybe you\u2019d have reason to suspect profiling but Aziz and Isis do sound pretty similar.\n\nThis story of possible bias was also covered by The Philly Inquirer. Unlike the Post, the Inquirer story explains how this minor dustup became news in the first place:\n\nSunday after leaving work, Philadelphia resident Abdul Aziz Johnson stopped at a Chestnut Hill Starbucks on Germantown Avenue with two friends and ordered three iced drinks, according to Jacob Bender, the executive director of CAIR-Philadelphia, the local chapter of the Council of American-Islamic Relations\u2026 In a press release, Bender asked, \u201cWas this an innocent mistake, or a sick joke associating Mr. Aziz and his friends, who were wearing traditional Muslim clothing, with the extremist group responsible for tens of thousands of deaths in Iraq and Syria, thus perpetuating the lie that Muslims are uniquely prone to violent behavior and terrorism?\u201d Timothy Welbeck, the lawyer representing Johnson, met with his client on Wednesday, who said he has ordered from this Starbucks before and no other barista had any problem with his name. The barista, like Johnson, was African American, Welbeck said.\n\nSo the Post story is basically a rewrite of this CAIR press release only the Post doesn\u2019t tell you that. That\u2019s an odd choice given that CAIR has a vested interest in seeing stories of anti-Islamic bias make the news. Also, the Inquirer quotes the line from the CAIR press release which acknowledges that this might have been an innocent mistake. The Post never mentions that even though it seems like a significant admission, one that matches with the explanation given by Starbucks.\n\nThe Post is literally pushing the bias incident angle harder than CAIR. Let that sink in a moment.", "description": "\"Was this an innocent mistake, or a sick joke...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard", "Karen Townsend", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ISIS-coffee.jpg"}
