As recently at three years ago, NBC held discussions with Wolff on the rebranding of the Oxygen cable channel as a crime and punishment themed service. Some conversations included branding it with Wolf's name -- Wolf Net.\n\nDick Wolf (Arnold Jerocki/WireImage)\n\nNow with a huge library in hand, speculation is underway in Hollywood whether Wolf will take some of the crazy money that services like Netflix and HBOMax have thrown at the likes of Jerry Seinfeld or the makers of \"Friends\" or some wonder if the Wolf Net idea could return possibly as its own streaming service.\n\n\"He\u2019s become very sought-after and he\u2019s as familiar to viewers as some of the actors on his shows \u2013 if not more so \u2013 so why not leverage that brand?\u201d asks media consultant Brad Adgate, \"I would suggest he would probably do a streaming service because it's probably a lower bar of entry than a cable network.\"\n\nThe media landscape has changed to the benefit of uber producers like Wolf.\n\n\"I think that the people behind the cameras are becoming, in some instances, as big a celebrity - or brand - as those people in front of the cameras,\u201d said Adgate. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting when you have (producers) like J.J. Abrams and Shonda Rhimes and Brian Grazer and Ron Howard, these people have become kind of celebrities unto themselves, and they\u2019re making a lot of money by putting themselves out there, and with all the competition out there for their services, they\u2019ve become what I\u2019d call, like, a hot property, and I think Dick Wolf is certainly one of them.\"\n\nRhimes parlayed her brand into a massive production deal with Netflix in 2017 that also allowed her to keep producing shows for ABC, where she is known for hits including \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cHow To Get Away With Murder.\u201d She also created a lifestyle-focused web outlet, Shondaland, hosted by Hearst Magazines, to connect to her fans.\n\nWolf Entertainment is ramping up their efforts as speculation rises that the streaming rights to the original \u201cLaw & Order\u201d series empire would fetch millions from one of the many new subscription-video services trying to gain a foothold on market share. The only \u201cL&O\u201d series on a streaming service is \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victim's Unit,\u201d which is on Hulu and Netflix but is scheduled to leave the latter's menu.\n\nWith new entrants to the field of streaming services - including CBS All Access, Apple TV+ , Disney+ and Peacock from Comcast - there have been many lucrative deals for hit programs in recent weeks, such as \u201cBig Bang Theory\u201d landing on WarnerMedia's HBO Max and Netflix's major deal with \"Seinfeld\" last week.\n\nWolf is \"as familiar to viewers as some of the actors on his shows \u2013 if not more so \u2013 so why not leverage that brand?\u201d Media consultant Brad Adgate\n\nWolf\u2019s catalog of programs is estimated to total 72 seasons and 1,568 total hours. Even though sitcoms have commanded the high prices of late and Wolf's hallmark is drama content, the sheer volume of Wolf Entertainment will make it interesting to see how much streaming companies value a drama brand.\n\n\u201cThe key, I think, and what\u2019s unusual - in particular with \u2018Law & Order\u2019 - is that, for a one-hour drama, they\u2019ve always repeated well,\" says Adgate. \"The whole \u2018Law & Order\u2019 franchise, it\u2019s one of those comfort foods; you see it and you\u2019ll spend an hour or two watching a show, and you don\u2019t get that with dramas as much. He had the foresight to create these one-hour self-contained dramas that had a beginning, a middle, and an end. I think that a key to the success of these franchises is the shelf life that they have.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Renowned producer Dick Wolf rebranded his production company, could his own streaming service be upcoming in the future?", "authors": ["Jason Schott"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Dick-Wolf-GettyImages-1156232554.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
