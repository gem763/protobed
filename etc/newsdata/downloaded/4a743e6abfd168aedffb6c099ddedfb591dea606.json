He just doesn\u2019t talk politics,\u201d said Bob Eatinger, a former CIA deputy general counsel who is friends with Zaid after often debating him when in government. \u201cAnybody who says he\u2019s doing this for political slant is just making it up.\u201d\n\nSteven Cash, a national security lawyer at Day Pitney in Washington, D.C., echoed Eatinger, saying he has \u201cno idea what his politics are, to tell you the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cLawyers represent clients. They don\u2019t usually represent causes,\u201d Cash continued. \u201cMark represents clients, he doesn\u2019t represent causes.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHaving graduated from Albany Law School of Union University in 1992, Zaid moved to Washington by July 1993 and started representing victims in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, filing the first civil suit against the Libyan government in 1993.\n\nZaid counts among his accomplishments drafting legislation that enabled U.S. victims to file civil lawsuits against terrorist states, which passed as an amendment to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act in 1996.\n\nZaid has also worked on a number of prominent Freedom of Information Act lawsuits, including representing Mohamed al Fayed when he sued the CIA in 2000 to obtain files on Britain\u2019s Princess Diana.\n\nThe Washington attorney was also part of the legal team that successfully sued to halt the Pentagon\u2019s compulsory anthrax vaccination program in the early 2000s.\n\nWhen asked what motivates him in his work, Zaid explained that it\u2019s about holding the government accountable, though he was careful to note that he doesn\u2019t consider himself an enemy of the government.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not ideological. We think our government does a lot of things right. I\u2019m not an enemy of the CIA. I sue it all the time, I criticize it all the time, because it deserves it. But we work closely at times with it because it\u2019s in the best interest,\u201d Zaid said.\n\nWhen Zaid\u2019s cases have drawn political attention, he says he focused on representing his clients and not getting sucked into the political fray. He noted that, when he was representing clients in the Benghazi congressional investigation, Republicans were friendly to him.\n\nZaid recalled drinking port with Rep.
