At a time of unprecedented political and constitutional upheaval, the outcome will be hard to predict.\n\nThe U.K. is still unable to complete its tortured divorce from the European Union, and Johnson has failed to get Parliament to ratify his withdrawal agreement. The election may now turn into a proxy referendum on Brexit, the last chance for voters to choose between politicians campaigning to stay in the EU or leave it immediately.\n\n\u201cThere is only one way to get Brexit done in the face of this unrelenting parliamentary obstructionism,\u201d Johnson told the House of Commons on Tuesday. \u201cThat is, Mr Speaker, to refresh this Parliament and give the people a choice.\u201d\n\nJohnson Versus Corbyn\n\nThe campaign will pit Johnson, the charismatic and controversial face of the pro-Brexit movement, against the radical left-wing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who defied pundits and pollsters and nearly won power two years ago.\n\n\u201cThis is a once in a generation chance to build a country for the many, not the few,\u201d Corbyn said on Twitter to announce Labour\u2019s support for the early poll. \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nWhile Johnson is seeking to cash in on his fame and commitment to delivering on the 2016 vote to leave the EU, Corbyn offers a socialist alternative of raising taxes on the rich and nationalizing railways and utilities.\n\nThe last time the country went to the polls, in 2017, Labour and the Conservatives won more than 80% of the vote between them as the smaller parties faded away. This time, with Brexit still unresolved, both main parties face challenges from marginal movements that have grown in popularity.\n\nNo Brexit Camp\n\nOn the pro-EU side, the Liberal Democrats have surged in opinion polls and lower profile elections recently, on their platform of clear opposition to Brexit. That is a threat to Corbyn, in particular. Many of his supporters want him to adopt a clearer anti-Brexit stance.\n\nFor Johnson, the main peril comes from the veteran euro-skeptic Nigel Farage. He launched his Brexit Party in January to campaign for a clean, quick split from the EU. It then won popular vote in the European Parliament elections in May. With Johnson having failed to deliver his core mission to complete Brexit by Oct. 31, the door is open to Farage to take votes away from the Conservatives.\n\nOn Monday, the EU agreed to postpone Brexit day until Jan. 31 to give Johnson more time to persuade members of Parliament to ratify the deal he struck on Oct. 17. That gave Corbyn the justification he needed to back a poll.\n\n\u201cFor the next three months, our condition of taking no-deal off the table has now been met,\u201d Corbyn told his top team on Tuesday, according to a party statement. \u201cWe will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Johnson won a vote in the House of Commons for a law enabling a Dec. 12 election to take place. That law must be approved in the House of Lords before it comes into force, but it is now unlikely to be blocked.\n\n--With assistance from Greg Ritchie and Alex Morales.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Tim Ross in London at tross54@bloomberg.net;Robert Hutton in London at rhutton1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Flavia Krause-Jackson at fjackson@bloomberg.net\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. will hold an emergency election in six weeks\u2019 time, in a critical poll that will shape the country\u2019s destiny for decades to come.Prime Minister Boris Johnson won backing in Parliament to trigger the snap vote in an attempt to resolve the Brexit crisis that has paralyzed the country", "authors": ["Tim Ross", "Robert Hutton"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/x8YmN40g3KYOgA6wJzv2Mw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/bloomberg_politics_video_969/615b634703e19d9cce1b9877ca0a3622", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
