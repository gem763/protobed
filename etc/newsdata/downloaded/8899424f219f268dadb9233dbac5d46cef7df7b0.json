Dick Durbin (D-Il.) threatened to call on the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s acting commissioner to resign if he didn\u2019t take immediate action on the recent surge of vaping-related deaths and severe illnesses, which have now impacted hundreds of people across the country.\n\nIn an angry letter to the federal official Friday, Durbin accused acting Commissioner Dr. Ned Sharpless of refusing to do his job to protect the public from the risks linked to e-cigarettes and vaping. The senator gave Sharpless 10 days before he calls for resignation.\n\nDurbin said that this \u201cpublic health crisis\u201d could have been avoided altogether if the FDA had done more to regulate these products, adding that the agency had 10 years to do so. The senator also said he and several health groups have been warning the agency of vaping\u2019s health risks and marketing tactics, which are \u201centicing and hooking young people\u201d on the products.\n\n\u201cAs Acting Commissioner of the FDA, you alone have the power to stop this vaping epidemic, which now has reached the point where children and young adults are getting sick and dying,\u201d Durbin said.\n\nThe vaping epidemic has now reached the point where multiple people have died and over 450 have been hospitalized, but @FDACommissioner is sitting on his hands. If Dr. Sharpless doesn\u2019t take action in the next 10 days, I plan to call for his resignation. Enough is enough. pic.twitter.com/6yXbu3TxSn \u2014 Senator Dick Durbin (@SenatorDurbin) September 6, 2019\n\nOn the day Durbin sent his letter, the number of cases of severe breathing illnesses linked to the new-age nicotine products spiked to 450 across 33 states. As many as three deaths have also been reported, with a fourth fatality currently under investigation.\n\nThis week, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued several warnings urging people to stop vaping while they investigate what\u2019s causing these problems. So far, they have not identified a single common product or ingredient that is causing problems across all cases.\n\nIn response to Durbin\u2019s letter, an FDA spokesperson told HuffPost that the agency has been keeping members of Congress informed of the ongoing investigation and has sent a warning to the vape industry.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to engaging with Senator Durbin, along with all members of Congress, on this ongoing and very serious situation,\u201d FDA press officer Stephanie Caccomo said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put the industry on notice: If the disturbing rise in youth e-cigarette use continues, especially through the use of flavors that appeal to kids, we\u2019ll take even more aggressive action,\u201d Caccomo added.\n\nShe did not provide further details on what that specific action might be.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also urged the FDA to take action on Friday, specifically calling on banning flavors added to the devices and \u201cslick marketing tactics\u201d employed by vape companies.\n\nVaping sickness is surging\u2014with deadly consequences. Teens & adolescents need to know what dangerous components make up e-cigarettes\u2014a toxic stew of unknown chemicals & addictive nicotine. The FDA needs to act, banning flavors & slick marketing tactics. https://t.co/ZxqXlYkAwf \u2014 Richard Blumenthal (@SenBlumenthal) September 6, 2019\n\nEarlier Friday, the commissioner said the agency was \u201cworking tirelessly\u201d with other federal and state agencies to understand these cases and find a solution.\n\nSharpless, along with CDC Director Robert R. Redfield and Secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II, wrote an op-ed in USA Today Thursday vowing to make the vaping illnesses a top priority.\n\nIn that op-ed, the federal officials again warned people against buying off-market vaping products or modifying their vape products in any way.", "description": "Sen.
