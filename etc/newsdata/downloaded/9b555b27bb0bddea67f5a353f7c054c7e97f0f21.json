He was 85.\n\nRussian space agency Roscosmos Space Corporation announced his passing Friday. State news agency RIA-Novosti reported he'd been chronically ill before his death.\n\nThough Leonov wasn't the first man on the moon ( a goal he wasn't shy about ), he earned his own \"first\" in the space race between the US and Soviet Union. On March 18, 1965, he embarked on the first spacewalk, spending 12 minutes outside the Voskhod 2 capsule.\n\nThe first American to walk in space, Ed White , wouldn't do so until June that same year.\n\nOn the Apollo-Soyuz mission in 1975, Leonov met with US astronauts in space and gave TV viewers tours of their respective crafts, the first time Soviet and US cosmonauts collaborated in space. The mission is credited with kick-starting eventual international cooperation aboard the International Space Station.\n\nRead More", "description": "Alexei Leonov, the first person to perform a spacewalk, died this week.
