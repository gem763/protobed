What I really wanted was to spark industrial creativity, to set up new modes of behaviour in our industry and services.\n\nTaking advantage of the support the scheme offers interior architect Thibaut Gilgquin and graphic designer H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Hoyois created a business making verrines, little edible food baskets.\n\nThey were given a launch fund of 40,000 euros and access to the expertise of an agency that helps innovative start-ups get going in Wallonia.\n\n\u201cWe came with just an idea. For three months, from 8am to 8pm, we worked with two coaches who sped things up,\u201d said Gilgquin. \u201cAnd that enabled us to build up our company, to have a business model, a business plan, to study the market and really build the firm.\u201d\n\nSelf-belief was a key element in getting their project, \u2018Do Eat\u2019, off the ground.\n\n\u201cWe learned how to defend our project, to do a pitch in less than a minute to convince investors, said Hoyois. \u201cSeparately, we managed to raise a first cash injection of 60,000 euros.\u201d\n\nThe results were very encouraging. Production levels soared. Two acclaimed chefs came on board and the product went on sale little by little in Europe. The verrines were made in a workshop in Hainaut, one of the Wallonia regions hit hardest by the recession.\n\nThe pair had a particular reason for basing themselves there.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very attached to our region and we\u2019d like to develop the product and automise the production process, but also to continue working with local workshops around here. They will help us both grow, us and them,\u201d said Gilquin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to continue with this facilitation service, because we meet lots of other start-ups with whom we connect and get advice, particularly on the development of our website,\u201d added Hoyois.\n\nTo better understand how it all works Business Planet went to Brussels to meet the man behind the initiative. It was in 2011 as the Wallonian economy minister that Jean-Claude Marcourt launched the Creative Wallonia project, believing that the innovation and creativity of individual entrepreneurs would make it a success. .\n\n\u201cCreativity is often seen as limited to the creative industries; cinema, design, said Marcourt. \u201cWhat I really wanted was to spark industrial creativity, to set up new modes of behaviour in our industry and services.\u201d\n\nToday there are some 20 initiatives up and running in Wallonia, among them a start-up facilitator agency, co-working services, specific training for young people and a trend observatory .\n\nMarcourt explains how the scheme encourages people to work together: \u201cAn entrepreneur friend of mine recruited an anthropologist who had no clue about accounts or income statements. In return he gave my friend a different way of looking at his clients\u2019 needs and how to respond to them.\u201d\n\nSo what are the keys to success in this entrepreneurial context? For Thibaut Gilquin and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Hoyois they are \u201cto have confidence in yourself, to have confidence in others and, above all, to not be afraid to talk about your ideas\u201d.", "description": "The Belgian region of Wallonia and Tuscany in Italy are officially designated as the EU\u2019s two 'creative districts' \u2013 areas with specific policies to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/294538/1000x563_294538.jpg", "published_at": "2015-01-09"}
