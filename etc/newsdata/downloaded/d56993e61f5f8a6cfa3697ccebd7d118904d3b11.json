He insists, despite evidence to the contrary, that the standard phrase is an \u201cideological term\u201d invented later.\n\nKrenz has long dismissed as \u201cvictor\u2019s justice\u201d and \u201cpolitical persecution\u201d his post-reunification jail term of over six years for the regime\u2019s shoot-to-kill policy against those trying to flee it.\n\nIn this anniversary year, he has also called for a bit more gratitude for the German Democratic Republic (GDR), which he briefly presided over before it disappeared.\n\nThe most notable point was that \u201cno shot was fired,\u201d he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily.\n\n\u201cThat champagne flowed that evening and not blood, that is not the legacy of Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl, that is the legacy of the GDR!\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Why such big teeth?\u2019 \u2013\n\nA classic Eastern bloc party soldier, Krenz rose through the youth wing of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), served in the army, studied in Moscow, held top posts in security and propaganda and finally entered the powerful politburo \u2014 the centre of political power.\n\nHe was long considered the crown prince to his mentor, veteran leader Erich Honecker, and succeeded him as head of state and party leader in 1989.\n\nBritain\u2019s Independent newspaper has judged that Krenz, having risen through the one-party system \u201clike gas in a stagnant pond\u201d, ironically \u201cgot to the top just as the party was over\u201d.\n\nIt fell to Krenz in the turbulent days of 1989, as peaceful street protests rocked the detested Soviet-backed regime, to take the helm as the youngest general secretary of the ruling party.\n\nTaking over on October 18, he promised democratic reforms to match the glasnost and perestroika policies of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nBut his reassurances inspired little confidence with protesters who had heard him describe as \u201crestoring order\u201d communist China\u2019s Tiananmen Square massacre in June of that year.\n\nA famous protest placard portrayed Krenz as the wolf from the \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood\u201d fairytale, lying in bed with a toothy grin, with the words \u201cGrandmother, why do you have such big teeth?\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Unlucky crown prince\u2019 \u2013\n\nKrenz, facing a spiralling economic crisis, was soon abandoned by patron Moscow. He was powerless to stop the collapse of the state apparatus less than a month after taking office.\n\nIn the end, people power consigned the regime to history and swept away Krenz, who was pushed out of the SED hierarchy in December 1989.\n\nWithin less than a year the police state had vanished with Germany\u2019s national reunification of October 1990.\n\nTo an extent, Krenz himself had accelerated the GDR\u2019s collapse when he asked a member of the central committee to prepare to announce the liberalisation of travel abroad.\n\nIt was Berlin party boss Guenter Schabowski\u2019s clumsy delivery at a November 9 press conference that sent huge crowds surging to Berlin border points, where overwhelmed guards eventually relented and opened the gates.\n\nTo historians, Krenz is a tragic Cold War figure, an \u201cunlucky crown prince,\u201d said Stefan Bollinger, political scientist at Berlin\u2019s Free University.\n\n\u201cHe came to power too late and was too inconsistent to have any real influence on the course of history.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Ostalgie\u2019 champion \u2013\n\nIn 1997, a Berlin court sentenced Krenz to six and a half years prison, finding that he shared responsibility for the deaths of at least four people who had tried to escape to the West between 1984 and 1989.\n\nAfter multiple appeals, Krenz served just under four years behind bars from 2000.\n\nAfter his early release in late 2003, he retired to the small town of Dierhagen on the Baltic Sea coast.\n\nHe soon returned to public life, with speeches that defended politics in the vanished country, making him a standard-bearer for \u201cOstalgie\u201d \u2014 a play on words for nostalgia about the former country called Ostdeutschland.\n\nThe Berliner Zeitung daily once labelled him the \u201cincorrigible comrade\u201d.\n\nIn his book \u201cPrison Notes\u201d, Krenz wrote of his hope that future generations would want to rediscover truths about the GDR, instead of \u201ctotally condemning\u201d the country and \u201cmarginalising those who have defended it\u201d.", "description": "Berlin (AFP) \u2013 East Germany\u2019s last hardline communist leader, Egon Krenz, would like to set the historical record straight: the Berlin Wall", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/b474cb_german-democratic-republic-gdr-communist-leader-egon-krenz-no-apologies-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
