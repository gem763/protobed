The ageless pop icon and media mogul is reportedly in talks to perform at this February\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe promise of Lopez on stage for the biggest NFL game of the year is certainly enticing, especially as last year\u2019s halftime selection, Maroon 5, was a considered to be a bit underwhelming in their performance. Lopez remains one of the biggest stars in the world, with a broad reach that goes beyond music and touches her movie empire, lifestyle as well as her connection with the Latin audience.\n\nOn NBC\u2019s \"Today\" show, Lopez was asked about the possibility of performing at the Super Bowl halftime show. She didn\u2019t confirm discussions with the NFL.\n\nBut no cold water was poured on those rumors either by a somewhat coy Lopez.\n\n\u201cIt is something obviously that I would love to do - it would be an honor to do and it would be a lot of fun,\" Lopez said. \"I feel like more than anything, we would have a ball doing it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot that she needs to push her global brand any further, but the potential exposure for Lopez in headlining the halftime show is tremendous. Two years ago, Lady Gaga\u2019s halftime show was watched by 117.5 million television viewers. That number trails Katy Perry\u2019s performance in 2015, whose performance at the halftime show was watched by a record 120.7 million viewers.\n\nThe decision to choose Lopez makes plenty of sense for the NFL, given that this year\u2019s Super Bowl will be hosted by Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. Lopez is an avowed lover of the city to the point where she is a minority owner of the Miami Dolphins.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear likely though that Lopez will be cheering on her Dolphins in the Super Bowl, however. Following a 59-10 home loss in Week 1 to the Baltimore Ravens, the Dolphins have the longest odds in the NFL to win the Super Bowl.", "description": "Jennifer Lopez, a co-owner of the Miami Dolphins, is in talks with the NFL to perform in the Super Bowl halftime show.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/07/0/0/jlo-alex-rodriguez-1-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
