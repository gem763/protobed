Boone Pickens dead at 91", "language": "en", "text": "T. Boone Pickens, the billionaire tycoon who made his fortune in fossil fuels \u2014 only to spend his latter years advocating passionately for alternative energy \u2014 died on Wednesday, his office confirmed. He was 91.\n\nPickens, who began his career in oil and gas, became a titan of his industry, and helped to pioneer shareholder activism in the 1980s. Yet his thinking eventually evolved in a way that led him to embrace wind, solar, and other forms of natural energy to chip away at the dominance of fossil fuels.\n\nPickens actually didn\u2019t become a billionaire until after age 70. During a TV appearance, he was asked at what point he felt like he had made it.\n\nTo that, he responded: \u201cWhen I realized I had 12 bird dogs.\u201d\n\nHe later elaborated in a blog post: \u201cOK, it was a little tongue in cheek. But I\u2019ve always felt that to be wealthy is to have an abundance of something you really love. And for me that something would be bird dogs.\u201d\n\nBorn on May 22, 1928 to Thomas Boone Pickens and Grace Molonson Pickens, the tycoon was considered a miracle baby. During the long and complicated labor, the doctor told Pickens\u2019 father that he could either save the mother, or the child \u2014 but not both.\n\nPickens\u2019 father urged the doctor to try a Caesarean section using a one-and-a-half page description in a medical textbook. Pickens was the first baby successfully delivered by C-section in Holdenville, a small railroad town in eastern Oklahoma.\n\nT.

After graduation, Pickens went to Texas A&M on a basketball scholarship. After losing his scholarship, he transferred to Oklahoma A&M, now known as Oklahoma State University. He graduated in 1951 with a degree in geology, and never stopped being a die-hard booster for OSU sports.\n\nU.S. Senator Bob Dole (R) is presented a bullwhip April 12 by T.

After more than three years, he struck out on his own as an independent geologist in the Texas Panhandle.\n\nTwo years later, in 1957, he would build an oil and gas company that eventually became Mesa Petroleum \u2014 a company he took public and led for four decades. After leaving Mesa in 1996, he started a commodities hedge fund, BP Capital, at age 68.\n\nPickens transitioned BP Capital into a family-office in December 2017. Shortly after, his legacy in the energy space continued as the NYSE Pickens Oil Response ETF (BOON), though it was not managed by him. The BOON ETF recently moved away from fossil fuels into renewables.\n\nPickens was among the big activist shareholders of the 1980s. Among his famous deals and attempted deals were Cities Service, Gulf Oil, and Unocal.\n\nIn 1986, he formed the United Shareholders Association, a lobbying organization for shareholders. During a speech at the Economic Club of Detroit in 1988, he highlighted a \"transformation of Corporate America\" that \"focused on results, not size\" and one that would \"create value, not empires.\"", "description": "An oil tycoon who transformed corporate America.", "authors": ["Julia La Roche"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hEFBxEZbi_byCjiqvmDJqw--~B/aD0yMzMzO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/3c41fb70-d4bf-11e9-abff-3e480a2da94c", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
