Today, let\u2019s talk about the inverse of that \u2014 how even the brightest, most glittery silver linings can have clouds lurking nearby.\n\nWhat I\u2019m talking about is the downside of the amazingly low long-term interest rates that we\u2019ve got in the U.S. these days.\n\nOn the surface, they\u2019re a total blessing. But look beneath the surface and you can see all sorts of problems affecting pension funds; people trying to live off the interest on the savings they\u2019ve accumulated over their lifetimes; and the future of Social Security.\n\nLet me explain.\n\n[Trump says \u2018Boneheads\u2019 at Fed should cut interest rates to zero \u2014 or even set negative rates]\n\nAs I write this, 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds carry an interest yield of about 2.25 percent, and corporations are lining up to sell billions of bucks of low-interest, long-term bonds before the debt markets come to their senses.\n\nThose lower interest costs are great, right? They make it cheaper for the federal government to finance its trillion-dollar (and growing) budget deficits. They make it possible for companies to use low-cost money to expand (if they\u2019re willing to risk doing that in the uncertain environment created by President Trump\u2019s trade wars and general unpredictability) or buy other companies or buy back their own stock or just to keep around.\n\nBut there are problems associated with these ultralow rates.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with pension funds. The lower interest rates fall, the deeper the financial hole in which funds find themselves.\n\nAccording to Piscataqua Research, a New Hampshire investment firm, by the end of next year, ultralow yields will have added about $1.25 trillion to the funding deficit faced by the 127 public employee pension systems that Piscataqua analyzes. This would increase the systems\u2019 total shortfalls to about $6.5 trillion.\n\nWhat\u2019s the problem? It has to do with how pension funds are supposed to calculate how many dollars they need to have on hand today to cover the payments they\u2019re obliged to make to workers past and present. The lower the rates, the more dollars a fund needs to have today to handle tomorrow\u2019s obligations.\n\nFor example, if a plan expects to have to make a $10,000 payment in 20 years and uses a 3 percent discount rate, today\u2019s obligation for that future payment is $5,537. But if it uses a 2 percent rate, today\u2019s obligation jumps to $6,730.\n\nThen there\u2019s a second pension-plan problem. Low bond yields make it more difficult for pension funds to meet their assumed investment returns on their assets, which Piscataqua says averages 7.23 percent for the funds that it covers.\n\nThat puts pressure on funds to offset the low income on their bond holdings. So it\u2019s natural for the funds to be tempted to put more money into risky, high-cost investments such as private-equity and venture capital funds.\n\nLoading up on such assets can make things look better awhile, because you can make all sorts of optimistic assumptions about the return these assets will make. However, history shows that just shoveling lots of money into high-cost, high-risk assets tends not to end well. \u201cLow interest rates are killing everybody who relies on income from investments,\u201d says Steve Church, president of Piscataqua Research.\n\n[How borrowers like Trump could use negative-rate deals]\n\nIndeed. As I\u2019ve said before (and will probably say again), very low rates like the ones we have now are bad for retirees who want to generate safe, reasonable income on the savings they spent a lifetime accumulating. That\u2019s especially true for retirees of modest means.\n\nAbout a decade ago, with the U.S. stock market reeling and the world financial system threatening to implode, the Federal Reserve drove down interest rates to stimulate the economy and nudge investors to put more money into stocks.\n\nThat worked out great for people who had financial staying power to handle the risks of buying stocks when markets were in disarray and the Great Recession was upon us.\n\nThese days, with the economy strong but interest rates falling, people are being nudged into stock markets again \u2014 although this time, I don\u2019t think the Fed is doing it on purpose.\n\nBut unlike a decade ago, stock prices are quite high. That makes stocks a riskier investment than they were back then, because they\u2019ve got less upside and more downside.\n\nAnd finally, lower yields on Treasury securities mean less income for the Social Security Trust Fund, whose $2.9 trillion of assets consist entirely of Treasury securities. The lower the trust fund\u2019s income, the earlier the fund risks running out of money.\n\nSo enjoy low interest rates if you\u2019re a borrower or would-be borrower.
