After a century of favouring the smooth industrial efficiency of mass production over the idiosyncrasies of craftsmanship, taste-makers around the world are rediscovering the pleasure to be derived from the hand-touched, the artisanal.\n\n\u201cCraft is an innate human expression,\u201d says Jonathan Anderson, creative director of Loewe, the 173-year-old Madrid-based fashion and accessories brand. \"I think it is underappreciated, but I believe it is more important and influential than ever.\"\n\nAnderson, who also helms the eponymous London fashion label JW Anderson, inaugurated the Loewe Foundation Craft Prize three years ago as a platform to champion little-known creatives and to highlight Loewe\u2019s roots in fine leather craftsmanship.\n\nCraggy Block Seat by Jim Partridge and Liz Walmsley. Supplied\n\nWorks by this year\u2019s 29 finalists (from more than 2500 entries) were shown in July at the Heaven stone garden in Tokyo, which was designed by Isamu Noguchi in 1977. These included a seat carved from a block of charred oak \u2013 as humble as a stool, mighty as a throne \u2013 and an ethereal, tripodal vessel made from copper, hand-beaten until skin thin using a 4000-year-old hammering technique.\n\nSurface Tactility #11 by Genta Ishizuka won this year's Loewe Foundation Craft Prize. Supplied\n\nThe prize was awarded to Genta Ishizuka, a 37-year-old sculptor from Kyoto who specialises in the ancient urushi lacquer technique using sap of the tree of that name, prized for the hardness of its finish. His otherworldly piece, titled Surface Tactility #11, is like an amorphous blob of haemoglobin, the many layers of blood-red lacquer at once transparent and glossy, appearing almost liquid. \u201cThe most beautiful thing about lacquer is its tactility,\u201d Ishizuka said at the awards ceremony.\n\n\u201cIshizuka\u2019s work stood out because it felt like it was breaking new ground and opening up new frontiers for craft,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cHis mundane starting point, a bag of oranges, combined with his use of ancient Japanese lacquer techniques ended up producing a truly modern object that defied conventions. I love this freedom of creation.\u201d\n\nThe conversation (not to say battle) between design and craft dates back to the first Industrial Revolution, which began in Europe in about 1760. Until then, furniture and objects were conceived and made by the same artisans, but as conception became increasingly separated from production, the new role of \u201cdesigner\u201d was invented for the people who developed the ideas. John Flaxman, the British sculptor who devised ceramics for Wedgwood in the late 1700s, was the prototypical designer.\n\nThe influential Arts and Crafts movement of the late 19th century was the first widespread backlash against the rigours of industrial production. But the innovations driven by military investment in World War I gave rise to a victorious modernist movement that sought to rationalise production and standardise consumption \u2013 along the way assuming the mantle of inevitability.", "description": "The annual Loewe Foundation Craft Prize shows that quirkiness and contemporary luxury can be one and the same, writes Stephen Todd.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.188%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_96%2C$y_198/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d31f3b46d85fd62d3321126a753b8a6c2e71a1b8", "published_at": "2019-07-12"}
