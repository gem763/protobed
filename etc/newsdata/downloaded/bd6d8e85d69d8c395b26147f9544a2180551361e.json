In the end it earned him his walking papers.\n\nCardenas began his live broadcast from the car show by saying he felt like a kid in a candy store with no one around to enforce any rules.\n\nIt was hours before the show was to open, he added, and no one was there to keep him off the cars, many of which he reported were off-limits.\n\n\"So I'm just going to live on the wild side,\" he said before climbing onto the trunk of a yellow T-bird convertible.\n\nNext up, he yanked open the door of a pink 1957 T-Bird, accidentally dinging its door against a green T-Bird parked next to it.\n\n\"Oh no, I hit that other car,\" he said.\n\nThen, looking around furtively, he quickly added, \"I don't think anyone saw it.\"\n\nHe ended the segment with a grand finale of sorts, ignoring a \"keep off\" sign placed in front of a new Ford hybrid SUV and leaping onto its hood. The result was a loud crashing sound and the voice of someone off camera yelling, \"Get off.\"\n\n\"Oh boy, I'm going to get in trouble,\" Cardenas says.\n\nThe car show's producer, Stacey Castle Bascom, told the Sacramento Bee that KMAX officials told her Monday Cardenas had been fired.\n\nKMAX and Cardenas did not immediately respond to emails from The Associated Press on Tuesday, and Cardenas was not pictured as among the \"Good Day Sacramento\" staff on the station's website.\n\nCardenas says on his personal website he's worked in all forms of broadcast news, including as reporter, anchor and camera operator in a career of more than a dozen years at several TV and radio stations.\n\nBascom said none of the cars were damaged but that the show's producers were outraged nonetheless.\n\nIndeed, Cardenas, who seemed to admire the cars, had violated a key tenet of the classic car community: You don't touch another person's ride without their permission, let alone jump all over it.\n\n\"These are antiques, and in many ways, objects d'art,\" one poster explained. \"One doesn't do this in a museum.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
