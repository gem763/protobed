The company said it would appeal.\n\nAmerican Airlines jumped 3.1 percent as it said a key benchmark on revenue rose to 2.5 percent from 1.5 percent in the third quarter, indicating strong demand despite a hit from Hurricane Dorian and the continued effect of the grounding of Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX planes.\n\nAmerican again pushed back the timeframe for resuming flights on the MAX, this time through mid-January.\n\n\u2013 Key figures around 2050 GMT \u2013\n\nNew York \u2013 Dow: UP 0.7 percent at 26,346.01 (close)\n\nNew York \u2013 S&P 500: UP 0.9 percent at 2,919.40 (close)\n\nNew York \u2013 Nasdaq: UP 1.0 percent at 7,903.74 (close)\n\nLondon \u2013 FTSE 100: UP 0.3 percent at 7,166.50 (close)\n\nParis \u2013 CAC 40: UP 0.8 percent at 5,499.14 (close)\n\nFrankfurt \u2013 DAX 30: UP 1.0 percent at 12,094.26 (close)\n\nEURO STOXX 50: UP 0.9 percent at 3,459.14 (close)\n\nPound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2205 from $1.2219 at 2100 GMT\n\nEuro/pound: UP at 89.89 pence from 89.67 pence\n\nEuro/dollar: UP at $1.0972 from $1.0957\n\nDollar/yen: UP at 107.49 yen from 107.09 yen\n\nTokyo \u2013 Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.6 percent at 21,456.38 (close)\n\nHong Kong \u2013 Hang Seng: DOWN 0.8 percent at 25,682.81 (close)\n\nShanghai \u2013 Composite: UP 0.4 percent at 2,924.86 (close)\n\nBrent North Sea crude: UP 0.1 percent at $58.32 per barrel\n\nWest Texas Intermediate: DOWN 0.1 percent at $52.59 per barrel\n\nburs-jmb/dg", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 European and US stock markets rebounded Wednesday, helped by reports that China was open to a partial trade deal with the United", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/1bd16c_can-deal-limited-one-delivered-stocks-recover-on-us-china-trade-talks-optimism-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
