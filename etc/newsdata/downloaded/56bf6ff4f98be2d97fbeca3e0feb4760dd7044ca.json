(Andrew Mills/NJ Advance Media via AP)\n\nWhen Maryland\u2019s offense stepped onto the field against Rutgers, the unit needed to show meaningful progress. Against an inferior opponent, the Terrapins had a prime opportunity to provide reassurance that the sluggish, error-prone performances in the previous two outings would not persist.\n\nSo when Dontay Demus Jr., the standout sophomore wide receiver, caught an 80-yard touchdown pass on Maryland\u2019s first offensive play, it appeared to be the emphatic first step in creating the critical confidence-inspiring performance. In doing so, Demus reminded everyone of the bursts that fuel this offense: explosive plays, in the air and on the ground, that quickly generate chunks of yards \u2014 and frequently touchdowns.\n\nBut the next 12 plays, spanning four drives that ended in punts, also showed a key characteristic of Maryland\u2019s offense. The Terps have been as inefficient as they are explosive, a troubling throwback to last season. In those 12 plays that followed the dynamic start, Rutgers sacked Josh Jackson twice and Maryland lost three yards.\n\n[As LSU revels in a newly brilliant offense, it can thank the coaching cradle of William & Mary]\n\nThe solution, Coach Michael Locksley said as his team prepares for its Saturday matchup at Purdue, is to be more effective on first down. Especially in the two losses and even at times during the successful offensive showings, Maryland has struggled to do so, which leads to more difficult second-down calls and ultimately third-and-long attempts. During those sluggish early drives against Rutgers, Maryland needed to gain at least five yards on every third down. The offense failed each time.\n\n\u201cOur first-down efficiency needs to get back to where it was earlier in the year, and we can help that some with how we call it,\u201d Locksley said. He added that better execution from the offensive line and blocking on the perimeter would help: \u201cAll those little things really show up on first down.\u201d\n\nIn the three wins, the Terps\u2019 median gain on first down was three yards. The typical first-down outcome was just one yard in the Temple loss and no gain in Penn State\u2019s rout. The Terps have lost or gained no yardage on 38 percent of their plays in 2019, a slightly worse mark than last season\u2019s 34 percent.\n\nBut the Terps have survived \u2014 and dominated three of their five opponents \u2014 by leaning on their abundance of athletes who take turns triggering huge plays.\n\nRunning back Anthony McFarland Jr., the team\u2019s most prolific big-play creator, frequently explodes down the sideline after eluding defenders. Despite a minor ankle injury, he scored on an 80-yard run against Rutgers.\n\nMcFarland has \u201cprobably one of the more unique combinations of speed and quickness that I have seen in a long time with the football in his hands,\u201d offensive coordinator Scottie Montgomery said before the season began.\n\nIt\u2019s not simply McFarland\u2019s speed that makes him elusive. Montgomery credited the way McFarland is so efficient in the way he cuts. He tucks the ball quicker than most, Montgomery said, so if McFarland catches the ball on the perimeter, he \u201chas a chance to eye up linebackers at six yards away versus three to four yards away, which gives him a much better chance to make them miss.\u201d\n\nFellow running back Javon Leake becomes a threat in space thanks to his speed. He returned a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown against Rutgers after he dropped the ball in the end zone and then ran toward the opposite side of the field. On top of his special teams bursts, Leake has run for a gain of at least 30 yards three times this season.\n\n[Miami has the Turnover Chain. Maryland has a throne of towels.]\n\nOnce Leake breaks through the last few defenders, he said his only thought is, \u201cJust don\u2019t get caught.\u201d He knows he has the necessary speed, so \u201cthat would be the worst.\u201d\n\nMaryland\u2019s No. 3 running back, Tayon Fleet-Davis, offers ability of a similar level. All of the running backs have become more involved in the passing game under Locksley, but Fleet-Davis became the back who showed off this skill set against Rutgers. On consecutive plays, he caught a pass for a 50-yard gain and then scored on a 23-yard reception.\n\n\u201cThat was my first time\u201d catching a long pass like that, Fleet-Davis said this week. \u201cIt was actually fun, just getting that receiver feeling and being that open in the open field. I got excited.\u201d\n\nParticularly in the first two games, with quarterback Josh Jackson playing well, Maryland made massive gains through the air, as well. Demus, along with fellow receivers DJ Turner, Darryl Jones and Brian Cobbs, made contributions to this year\u2019s offensive machine that generates explosive plays at a high rate.\n\nBut the passing game will miss a few important pieces against Purdue: Turner, who has also returned a kickoff for a touchdown this year, is still suspended as a result of his Sept. 20 charges for driving while under the influence. Backup quarterback Tyrrell Pigrome will replace Jackson (high ankle sprain).\n\nIn all of Maryland\u2019s wins, the offense has combined for at least six plays of at least 20 yards. In the loss against Temple, the Terps had three such plays. Against Penn State, a 59-0 blowout, they didn\u2019t generate any.\n\nWhenever a player such as McFarland gains massive yardage at once, it helps mask the offense\u2019s occasional inefficiencies. A few quick scores make the previous futile drives seem irrelevant.\n\n\u201cEverybody can do everything,\u201d Leake said of the running backs. \u201cFleet can catch. Ant is fast. I'm fast. We all can do all those things and show our versatility. I just feel like all three of us are a complete package.\u201d\n\nJust consider the Rutgers win: Immediately after those four early drives generated no promising offensive moments, Maryland scored on three straight plays. First came the three-play drive that included Fleet-Davis\u2019s back-to-back long receptions. The next offensive snap became a 42-yard touchdown run from Leake. Then an interception and long return from Ayinde Eley gave McFarland the chance to punch in the score from the 2-yard line.\n\nThe slow start no longer mattered because the Terps suddenly led by two scores. Few will look back at that game and feel concerned about the prolonged stretch when Maryland couldn\u2019t move the ball. Because with explosive plays as their fuel, the Terps won. And they did so easily.\n\nRead more about college football:\n\nFeinstein: Wake Forest football is 5-0 and acting like it\u2019s been there before\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the worst way to get the job,\u2019 but Tyrrell Pigrome is again in line to be Maryland QB\n\nCollege football\u2019s offer next weekend?
