The family has since alleged that not only was she terrifying and dangerous, but also in her 20s.\n\nAs charges against her adoptive parents make their way to court, the girl has reportedly been living with a Christian family in the same state in Indiana.\n\nA family friend told the Daily Mail that Barnett is \"in a really awkward position\" and normal things like schooling have been complicated by the drama from her previous adoptive parents.\n\nVisit Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nAmid the controversy and mixed accounts surrounding Natalia Barnett, the Ukrainian orphan at the center of an adoption scandal, she has reportedly been living with a Christian family in the same state where she was left by a family who fled to Canada.\n\nThe Daily Mail reported that Barnett is living with 36-year-old Antwon Mans, a recently ordained pastor, and his wife Cynthia, 39, after her previous set of adoptive parents alleged she is actually a 20-something woman with a short stature as a result of a condition called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, Insider previously reported.\n\nKristine and Michael Barnett adopted Ukrainian-born Natalia in 2010, whom they then believed was around six years old, according to reports from Fox 59 and the Daily Mail.\n\nThe Barnetts legally changed the girl's age to 22 and left her in Indiana but moved the rest of their family to Canada, where their son, a child prodigy with mild autism, would pursue a physics graduate degree, according prosecutors cited by the Lafayette Journal & Courier.\n\nThe bizarre story first hit headlines when a five-year investigation concluded in September 2019 and authorities charged the Barnetts with neglecting a dependent.\n\nKristine and Michael Barnett. Tippecanoe County Jail\n\nCourt documents reported by WISH-TV, an Indianapolis CW affiliate, indicate that the girl's age was changed from 8 to 22 in 2012, the same year a scan at Peyton Manning Children's Hospital concluded she was 11.\n\nHowever, other documents including an Indiana University Health report from 2016 indicate Natalia was an adult. The document, which is currently unverified, alleges that she \"made a career of perpetuating her age facade.\"\n\nRead more: Parents who are accused of abandoning an 8-year-old Ukrainian girl they adopted say she was actually a 22-year-old mentally disturbed adult\n\n\"Natalia was a woman,\" Barnett told the Daily Mail after the charges were revealed. \"She had periods. She had adult teeth. She never grew a single inch, which would happen even with a child with dwarfism. The doctors all confirmed she was suffering a severe psychological illness only diagnosed in adults.\"\n\nDespite the drama, pictures posted to the new adoptive parents identified by the Daily Mail show Barnett is one of five children and dresses like a child.\n\nThough it's unclear if the Mans are the initial family that took over Natalia's care in 2013, they officially moved to become Natalia's legal guardians in 2016 but later withdrew their petition after the court upheld an earlier ruling that she was born in 1989 and not 2003, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nMultiple pictures posted to Facebook portray the family as close-knit and welcoming of Natalia. A family friend told the Daily Mail that the Mans \"already tried to speak to Natalia's adopted parents and tried to go through the courts,\" but \"they are just not getting anywhere and now this is escalating.\"\n\n\"She is just in a really awkward position and they are trying to help her out,\" the friend told the Daily Mail. \"There's actually very limited things they can do for her because people are saying she's 30. She can't even go to high school.\"\n\nThe family's cozy appearance on social media stands in sharp contrast to Barnett's accusations that Natalia was a terrifying and dangerous presence in their family that tried to stab them while they were sleeping, once tried to push her toward an electric fence, and poison her coffee.\n\nThe Mans did not immediately reply to Insider's request for comment.\n\nRead more:\n\nPeople are calling out double standards after Cardi B wore a full body-covering outfit in Paris, where Muslim women are banned from doing the same thing\n\nFans are calling out an Iranian music streaming site for erasing women from their own album covers\n\nHere's how Princess Beatrice's wedding to property tycoon and single dad Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi will change the royal family", "description": "As the case makes its way to court, plenty of questions remain about Natalia Barnett, the orphan at the center of an adoption scandal.", "authors": ["Ellen Cranley"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d927ed0f4fc2469b47c70ac?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
