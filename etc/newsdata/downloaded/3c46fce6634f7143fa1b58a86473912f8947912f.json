Absent any surprise change of heart from the Trump administration, the WTO\u2019s appellate body will be paralyzed in 10 weeks.\n\nThat could mean a return to an unconstrained environment of international trade conflicts which incoming EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan has likened to the \u201claw of the jungle.\u201d", "description": "Outlook for Global Commerce Darkens in New WTO Warning", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/piced2db4f656815308f2eb8a57f1508af4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
