'It was very random.'\n\nLucy Yorke-Long (left) become engaged to one of Britain's most eligible men, Bobby Worcester, heir to the Duke of Beaufort (pictured right with his mother Tracy\n\nBobby, 30, stands to inherit his father's estimated \u00a3315 million fortune, which includes the 52,000-acre Gloucestershire estate Badminton House (pictured)\n\nBobby, 30, who is currently titled the Marquess of Worcester, stands to inherit his father's estimated \u00a3315million fortune, which includes the 52,000-acre estate in Gloucestershire which hosts the Badminton Horse Trials and is where the sport badminton was invented.\n\nLucy, the 33-year-old daughter of a divorce mediator, adds: 'Bobby and I were seated next to each other at a dinner.\n\n'The person who put us next to each other would claim it was a set-up but, who knows, it might have just been luck.'\n\nBunter and Tracy divorced in 2018 and he has since married journalist Georgia Powell (pictured)\n\nThe colourful Duke, who is known as Bunter and plays in a rock band, tells me: 'I am absolutely delighted.'\n\nBobby's mother, the Duke's ex-wife, Tracy Worcester, was protesting with Extinction Rebellion this week.\n\nShe tells me: 'My kids and I are thrilled to have Lucy as part of our family \u2013 we all adore her.\n\n'She is sunny, intelligent and thoughtful - a joy to be with. Lucky Bobby.'\n\nTracy has recently separated from the Duke and is a keen eco-campaigner and committed Corbynista\n\nThe 52,000-acre estate in Gloucestershire hosts the Badminton Horse Trials and is where the sport badminton was invented\n\nTracy separated from Henry Somerset, 65, her husband of 30 years, the ebullient, larger-than-life 12th Duke who has since married.\n\nDespite the divorce, Tracy retained her title of Duchess of Beaumont for her eco-campaigning.\n\nShe left behind a glamorous career in modelling and acting, during which time she appeared in the Eighties detective series C.A.T.S. Eyes, in order to focus on her environmental activism.\n\nFor Tracy, a committed Corbynista in a high-vis cycling jacket, is Britain's least likely duchess, a woman who nurtures uncompromising views on farming and animal welfare.\n\nThe former actress once 'invaded' a pig farm, and thinks little of raising hackles at country-house dinner tables with her refreshingly pungent views.\n\nShe loves nothing more than discussing pigs \u2013 as well as the folly of an elite she believes is addicted to cruel factory farming at the expense of small farms and animal welfare.\n\nTo spread her message, she makes films for social media and fundraises with celebrity supporters such as Zac and Ben Goldsmith, actor Dominic West, model Jasmine Guinness and Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason.\n\nBobby's father Henry - better known as Harry \u2018Bunter\u2019 Beaufort, on the other hand, sings with seven-piece progressive rock band The Listening Device, described by Jools Holland as a 'cross between Ray Charles and Nick Cave'.\n\nIn 2017, the death of his 89-year-old father, the Duke of Beaufort, meant Harry succeeded the title as the 12th duke.\n\nWith it came one of England\u2019s most historic estates, a \u00a3315 million fortune and ownership of Badminton House, a Palladian mansion with 40 bedrooms, multiple staircases and walls hung with masterpieces, including a brace of Canalettos either side of the fireplace.\n\nLily James and Laura Carmichael cosy up\n\nDownton Ladies have a knees up\n\nLily James may not be in the big-screen version of Downton Abbey, but she's remained very close to the cast of the hit film nevertheless.\n\nThe actress, who played Lady Rose MacClare in the ITV costume drama, cosied up to Laura Carmichael \u2014 her on-screen cousin Lady Edith Crawley \u2014 at a party at Quaglino's restaurant in St James's, London.\n\nLet's hope Downton creator Julian Fellowes writes Lily into the sequel.\n\nFergie gets 60th party started early\n\nSarah, Duchess of York was presented with a selection of tiny treats prior to her birthday.\n\nFergie, 60 this coming Tuesday, blew out the candle on a plate at The Ivy in London, where she helped launch socialite Heather Kerzner's app, discover.film.\n\nShe tells me: 'I'm delighted to enjoy an early birthday celebration with my friend Heather.'\n\nFergie, 60 this coming Tuesday, blew out the candle on a plate at The Ivy in London\n\nDoes Nicole Scherzinger have her eye on another famous sportsman?\n\nThe pop singer, 41, whose exes include F1's Lewis Hamilton and tennis star Grigor Dimitrov, appears to have taken a shine to rugby hunk Ben Foden.\n\nFoden, 34, appears on Simon Cowell's new reality show The X Factor: Celebrity, on which Nicole's a judge. Foden's formed a group called Try Star with fellow rugby players Thom Evans and Levi Davis for tonight's opening show.\n\nAs they snake through their moves to R&B number No Diggity for the judges, Scherzinger is seen purring seductively: 'I'm single and ready to mingle.'\n\nSeated beside her, Cowell rolls his eyes and tells her: 'It's time to leave the sports stars alone, babe.'\n\nAs Newsnight's chief inquisitor, Emily Maitlis is used to cutting off long-winded politicians.\n\nAnd her husband, Mark Gwynne, appears to have learned from the master.\n\n'He's limited me to just four minutes a day on Brexit,' she says at the Wimbledon Book Festival.\n\n'When I come back from work, I like to tell him everything that's happened and then this beep goes off: 'Miss Maitlis, your Brexit time has ended.''\n\n(Very) modern manners\n\nWhat's the best way to consign an ill-fated relationship to the past?\n\nSocialite Alexandra Tolstoy, who split up with Russian billionaire Sergei Pugachev, has done so by selling off her entire 'oligarch wardrobe', as she calls the clothes he bought her.\n\nAlexandra held a house sale this week of clothes and shoes, including Louboutins at \u00a3140 a pair and a Dolce & Gabbana cardigan for \u00a3280. A fifth of the proceeds will go to charity, she pledges.\n\nAlexandra has three children with Pugachev \u2014 once known as 'Putin's banker' \u2014 who's been holed up in the South of France since he was accused in Russia of embezzling more than \u00a3655 million. 'Back to basics,' she says. 'So much cooler.'", "description": "EDEN CONFIDENTIAL: Top estate agent Lucy Yorke-Long has sold some desirable properties in her time, but none so magnificent as her future home, Badminton House.", "authors": ["Richard Eden For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/22/19608498-0-image-a-28_1570828452243.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
