Here are highlights from the report:\n\n--The producer-price index, a measure of prices businesses pay for goods and services, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in August from the previous month, the Labor Department said Wednesday.\n\n--Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected no change from July.\n\n--The gain/loss was primarily due to a 0.3% increase in service prices. Goods prices fell 0.5% on the month.\n\n--Excluding food, energy and trade services, all volatile categories, prices rose a robust 0.4%.\n\n--The producer-price measure typically tracks the same trends as other broad inflation gauges, though it does not always translate into what consumers pay.\n\nThe Labor Department's producer price index report can be accessed at: http://www.bls.gov/ppi\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 11, 2019 08:45 ET (12:45 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
