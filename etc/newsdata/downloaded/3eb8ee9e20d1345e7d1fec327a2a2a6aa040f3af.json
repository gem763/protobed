Some burst through security cordons to briefly enter the National Assembly on Tuesday afternoon, waving flags, pumping their fists and chanting: \u201cWe are the people!\u201d\n\nElsewhere in Quito and other flashpoints, masked and stick-wielding protesters hurled stones and battled with security forces, who responded with tear gas.\n\nFacing the biggest challenge yet to his 2-1/2-year rule, President Lenin Moreno has declared a state of emergency here and relocated government operations to the coastal city of Guayaquil where there has been less trouble.\n\nIn a written decree on Tuesday, Moreno ordered that authorities restrict movement in areas close to government buildings and strategic installations between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m. to maintain public order while the state of emergency remains.\n\nEarlier in the day, his government sought mediation from the United Nations or Roman Catholic Church to resolve the crisis. \u201cWe encourage dialogue as the necessary route to find a common cause that prioritise the national interest and social peace,\u201d Moreno said.\n\nProtests erupted last Thursday when the government cut fuel subsidies here as part of a package of economic reforms, in keeping with a $4.2 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan.\n\nIndigenous groups and others have been barricading roads with burning tires, rocks and branches. Police have deployed armoured vehicles and water cannon.\n\nNearly 600 people have been arrested, authorities say, including a legislator who supports Moreno\u2019s predecessor Rafael Correa.\n\nMoreno has accused the leftist Correa, his one-time mentor and boss when he was vice president, of seeking a coup with the help of Venezuela\u2019s President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nMoreno had enthusiastically backed Correa during his decade-long rule but broke with him after winning a 2017 election to succeed him, and moved economic policies to the right.\n\nDemonstrators take part in a protest against Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno's austerity measures, at the entrance of the National Assembly building, in Quito, Ecuador, October 8, 2019. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins\n\nSpeaking in Belgium, where he lives in self-imposed exile, Correa scoffed at the accusation.\n\n\u201cThey are such liars ... They say I am so powerful that with an iPhone from Brussels I could lead the protests,\u201d he told Reuters, holding up his mobile telephone.\n\n\u201cPeople couldn\u2019t take it anymore, that\u2019s the reality,\u201d he said, referring to economic belt-tightening measures.\n\nCHAOS\n\nMaduro, who has presided over an economic implosion and political crisis in Venezuela, denied on Tuesday that he had helped foment the protests and said Ecuador was rejecting the IMF\u2019s \u201csavage capitalist model.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why the Ecuadorean people are in the streets, not because of Maduro, because of survival,\u201d he said on state television.\n\nWith protesters swarming around Quito, various government buildings were attacked overnight, authorities said, adding to looting and the destruction of ambulances and police vehicles in recent days.\n\nIn one incident, two people appeared to have fallen from a bridge in Quito during confrontations between police and protesters. Videos on social media showed their bodies lying motionless on the ground, and the government promised an investigation. Indigenous groups have also captured some soldiers.\n\nThe unrest has affected oil output in the OPEC member. Ecuadorean state-run Petroamazonas estimates it could lose some 165,000 barrels-per day (bpd), or one-third, of crude production due to unrest at its facilities.\n\n\u201cThere are groups bent on causing chaos and confrontation, endangering democratic order,\u201d a government statement said.\n\nDialogue was necessary, the statement added, citing possible measures to compensate the impact of fuel price rises, such as credit lines for farmers and transport cooperatives.\n\nSlideshow (53 Images)\n\nAlthough he enjoys the support of business and the military, Moreno\u2019s popularity has sunk to under 30%, compared with 70% after his 2017 election.\n\nIndigenous-led protests brought down three presidents in the years before Correa\u2019s rule.\n\nSeven Latin American countries accused Maduro\u2019s \u201cregime\u201d in Venezuela of seeking to destabilize Ecuador and expressed their backing for Moreno in a statement. Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, whom many nations recognise as president, also accused Maduro of financing the protests in Ecuador.", "description": "Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno on Tuesday ordered a curfew around government buildings after six days of anti-austerity protests that have pushed his administration out of the capital Quito and brought hundreds of arrests amid violent protests.", "authors": ["Alexandra Valencia", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438591140&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF971SQ", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
