Authorities say they have killed several militants in gun battles and intercepted weapons.\n\nAuthorities on Thursday also released three low-ranking politicians who along with hundreds of other local lawmakers, activists and others have been detained since August 5.\n\nThose still in detention include three former Kashmir chief ministers: Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti.\n\nFarooq Abdullah, 81, was formerly arrested in mid-September under a law allowing him to be held for up to two years without charge that has been widely used, and criticised, in Kashmir.\n\nMore than 250 people have been sent to jails outside Jammu and Kashmir, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.\n\nUN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said last month she was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d while Washington has called for a \u201crapid\u201d lifting of restrictions.\n\nThe issue has clouded preparations for a two-day \u201cinformal summit\u201d between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping beginning in India on Friday.\n\nIndia\u2019s August move to split Jammu and Kashmir state in two irked China because it will make the Ladakh region \u2014 claimed in part by Beijing \u2014 of the state a separate administrative territory.\n\nChina has given diplomatic backing to Pakistan, while part of its Belt and Road infrastructure initiative passes through Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which is claimed by India.", "description": "Srinagar (India) (AFP) \u2013 India lifted on Thursday restrictions on tourists visiting Kashmir, but for hotels around the picturesque lake in Srinagar", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/9f8fb2_hotels-picturesque-lake-in-srinagar-are-shuttered-kashmir-hotels-or-shut-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
