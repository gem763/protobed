It seems they were trying to imply that Charles had not in fact worked on the palette for months as he claimed, but simply slapped his name on an existing product \u2013 a process known as \"private labelling\".\n\nCharles clapped straight back at the brand, calling the suggestion \"beyond unprofessional\" and saying Jiaxing Huasheng was simply the palette's manufacturer.\n\nDespite the YouTuber's obvious frustration, many seemed to find the whole feud pretty amusing.\n\nWhile the palettes do look similar, it's unclear whether this would constitute a copyright infringement. Charles has yet to threaten legal action, something many YouTubers are quick to do in these cases.\n\nHowever, others have pointed out that Charles himself has been accused of copying smaller influencers without giving proper credit in the past.\n\nEarlier this year Charles was accused of using a musical group's arrangement of the US national anthem and trying to pass it off as his own. In 2017 he was also accused of copying a smokey eye look originally created by influencer Lauren Curtis.\n\nThe Independent has reached out to James Charles, Morphe and Wet'n'Wild for comment.", "description": "It's been a while since James Charles has got himself involved in drama, but he's back with a vengeance, this time threatening legal action against make-up brand Wet'n'Wild.
