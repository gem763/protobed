We should feel able to say so | Yomi Adegoke", "language": "en", "text": "The silence surrounding the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s treatment by the press has become a roar. More than 70 female MPs signed a letter this week in \u201csolidarity\u201d with Meghan after she spoke about her treatment by sections of the media. The letter outlined attempts \u201cto cast aspersions\u201d on her character. It also attempted to address the nature of these attacks: \u201cWe are calling out what can only be described as outdated, colonial undertones to some of these stories,\u201d it read.\n\nHowever, this treatment can be described as only one thing: racist. Not saying so explicitly is part of a growing trend \u2013 the word \u201cracist\u201d is now dodged with more fervour than racial slurs themselves.\n\nAt one point, there was concern that \u201cracist\u201d was being used willy-nilly; now, it feels as if those in power are thumbing through a thesaurus with kid gloves, searching hastily for synonyms. The phrasing has become almost comically creative: take \u201cracially charged,\u201d \u201cracially loaded,\u201d \u201cracially divisive\u201d and \u201cracially tinged\u201d, as if bigotry is administered in doses with a pipette. \u201cHomophobically tinged\u201d and \u201csexistly charged\u201d sound equally ludicrous, but I am yet to see them used in lieu of the real terms.\n\nWhen Trump tweeted that some of the people of colour in Congress should \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,\u201d Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary at the time, resolved not to \u201cuse the R-word\u201d (his censoring of it, as if it were akin to the N-word, says it all). But who will resolve to use it? And if Trump\u2019s tweets didn\u2019t call for it, what occasion does?\n\nMany journalists are grappling with editorial guidelines that are making their jobs more difficult. Look at the censuring of the BBC presenter Naga Munchetty, after she said, in relation to Trump\u2019s comment, that every time she had been told to \u201cgo back to where [she] came from, that was embedded in racism\u201d. Attempts at impartiality lead to inaccuracy \u2013 when the Republican congressman Steve King asked why the terms \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d and \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d were offensive, NBC News originally told its staff to \u201cbe careful to avoid characterising [King\u2019s] remarks as racist.\u201d\n\nAlmost no behaviour seems to merit the descriptor, bar donning a Ku Klux Klan costume (except at Halloween, of course, when its white supremacist roots are apparently neutralised by \u201cbanter\u201d) and using the N-word (but not in song lyrics, of course, when its white supremacist roots are apparently neutralised by the beat).\n\nMore and more, it feels as if racism is being defined by those least likely to experience it \u2013 namely when they themselves are targeted. Apparently, calling rightwing, red-faced, middle-aged white men \u201cgammon\u201d is racist, yet golliwogs, according to 63% of Britons in a survey, are not racist.\n\nAs we tiptoe around the semantics and the word \u201cracism\u201d morphs into hate speech, hate crimes continue to soar. Unless something changes, this cycle will continue until \u201cracially tinged\u201d becomes equally as offensive and we replace it with another useless euphemism to protect the feelings of perpetrators.\n\n\u2022Yomi Adegoke is a Guardian columnist", "description": "The MPs who condemned the press attacks on the Duchess of Sussex should be praised, but tiptoeing around the language only protects perpetrators", "authors": ["Yomi Adegoke"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49e8e6c55fc59767d45529c8dfcb7152f1ac234a/0_0_3321_1993/master/3321.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8abd1471777f0a0821b8b240396a5ad6", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
