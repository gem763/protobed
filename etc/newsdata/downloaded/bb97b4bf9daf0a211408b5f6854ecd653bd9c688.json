Trade War Could Cool Them Down.", "language": "en", "text": "The rise of e-commerce has pushed up warehouse rents and made industrial buildings one of the hottest sectors in real estate. Now, a slowing economy and trade dispute between the U.S. and China threaten that boom.\n\nIn a new report, trade group NAIOP forecasts that less new industrial space will be occupied over the next two years, compared to the past two years. The group says the difference between new space being occupied and old space being vacated will drop to 37 million square feet per quarter over the next two years, down from 60 million over the past two years.\n\nA shortage of new developments explains part of the slowdown, said New York University economist Joshua Harris, one of the report\u2019s authors. But slowing business investment, weaker growth, and uncertainty brought by the trade dispute are also weighing on absorption, he said.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How do you see the industrial real estate market changing in the near future? Join the conversation below.\n\nThis was the first time in recent years that \u201cthe market didn\u2019t lease to its full potential,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Mr. Harris views the sector\u2019s long-term outlook as bright, \u201cindustrial is uniquely exposed to trade activity and manufacturing activity, which are very much impacted by the tariffs,\u201d he said, referring to the tariffs on Chinese imports imposed by the Trump administration\n\nManufacturing activity in the U.S. contracted for the first time in three years in August, according to the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index.\n\nMr. Harris said that some types of industrial real estate, most notably last-mile logistics facilities in major cities, are still in high demand. Meanwhile, construction of new industrial properties fell to a quarterly average of 42 million square feet in the first half of 2019, according to NAIOP, down from 54 million square feet in 2017 and 2018.\n\nInvestors have been undeterred. The dollar volume of industrial properties sold in the U.S. is on track to break its 2017 record this year, according to a July report from Real Capital Analytics. Property sales prices increased by 12.8% between July 2018 and July 2019.\n\nAs the decline of brick and mortar retail rolls on, commercial real estate developers are left with massive abandoned properties. Who will fill that underutilized space? A series of recent acquisitions by associates of Amazon in Northeastern Ohio provides some clues.\n\nIn June, the Blackstone Group agreed to buy a U.S. logistics portfolio from Singaporean investment firm GLP for $18.7 billion\u2014the most expensive private real estate deal in history. Other investment firms such as Ivanhoe Cambridge and Oxford Properties have also made big bets on warehouses over the past year.\n\nGina Szymanski, portfolio manager for real-estate securities at AEW Capital Management, said industrial real estate is less vulnerable to an economic slowdown than it used to be, largely because of the spread of e-commerce. \u201cThat structural change has added a demand driver that wasn\u2019t there 10 years ago,\u201d she said.\n\nWrite to Konrad Putzier at konrad.putzier@wsj.com", "description": "A trade group has forecast a decline in demand for new industrial properties in the next two years.", "authors": ["Konrad Putzier", "Konrad.Putzier Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107701/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
