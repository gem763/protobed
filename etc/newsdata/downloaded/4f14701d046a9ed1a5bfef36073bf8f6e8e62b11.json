Trump could still eke out a narrow victory, but with support for impeachment rising, there is now the possibility of the Democratic nominee winning a historic landslide \u2014 as House Democrats did in 2018 \u2014 if they play their cards right.\n\nWords cannot express the danger to democracy of a reelected Trump with a Republican majority in Congress marching in lockstep behind his dark vision of anti-democratic impulses, repeated claims that his major opponents are treasonous, and crony capitalist corruptions that must never again be allowed to dominate American politics and poison American democracy.\n\nBiden needs to convince a majority of Democratic delegates that he will fight for causes and values that Democrats deeply believe in, and that while he will seek national unity and bipartisanship when possible, he will fight like hell against the obstructive partisanship of Republicans such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellSusan Rice calls Trump decision to pull troops from Syria 'batshit crazy' Overnight Defense: Republicans urge Trump to reverse course on Syria | Dems subpoena Pentagon in impeachment probe | North Korea talks falter Trump defends Syria move: 'It's time to come back home' MORE (Ky.) \u2014 who began acting to destroy the presidency of Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaTrump's former ISIS envoy slams Syria decision: 'Donald Trump is not a Commander-in-Chief' Where are questions of economic and political inequality in the Democratic debates?

To call out abuse of power Democrats subpoena Pentagon, budget chiefs in impeachment push MORE for parading around the world trying to pressure intelligence services of democratic nations to support partisan GOP slanders of Biden or the Russian-promoted lie that Ukraine and not Russia interfered in the 2016 election. They should say that such partisan behavior is a grotesque abuse of the Justice Department and should constitute a firing offense.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBiden and Warren should directly and aggressively confront Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoUS moves to blacklist Chinese tech companies, agencies accused of repressing Muslim minorities The Hill's 12:30 Report \u2014 Presented by USAA \u2014 Trump sparks firestorm over Syria Democrats subpoena Pentagon, budget chiefs in impeachment push MORE for using his department to revive partisan attacks against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPoll: Trump gains among independents against Biden, Warren Hillary Clinton calls Trump's Syria pullout a 'sickening betrayal' of allies Where are questions of economic and political inequality in the Democratic debates?

They should drive home the truth that true capitalism creates fair competition in a just society that lifts workers, farmers and consumers which lifts investors and markets far more effectively than crony capitalism and mammoth tax cuts for the super wealthy.\n\nBiden must convince progressives he will fight hard for their values and visions. Warren must convince hundreds of millions of voters that she will give them vastly improved health care through Medicare without involuntarily stripping them of private insurance if they choose to have it.
