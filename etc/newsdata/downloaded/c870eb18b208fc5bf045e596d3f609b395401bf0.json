The region is a hotspot for violence linked to turf wars between drug cartels.\n\nMexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has been trying to tackle drug crime since he took office last December.\n\nWhat happened in El Aguaje?\n\nPolice patrol vehicles were ambushed as they passed through the town.\n\nReports say the convoy was surrounded by heavily armed men in a number of pick-up trucks who then fired on the officers and set their vehicles on fire.\n\nAt least 14 police officers were killed and three others injured.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mexico's drug war: Has it turned the tide?\n\nEl Aguaje is considered to be of strategic importance between two battling cartels: the Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n Cartel (CJNG) and a splinter group of the Knights Templar called Los Viagras.\n\nA message left at the site suggested the attack was carried out by gunmen connected to the CJNG.\n\nThe supposed leader of the CJNG was killed by Michoac\u00e1n police less than a week ago.\n\nIn Michoac\u00e1n in August, nine people were found hanging from a bridge with seven other corpses found on the road.\n\nThe federal government offered assistance to the state authorities after Monday's attack.\n\nMichoac\u00e1n Governor Silvano Aureoles Conejo said there would be \"no impunity\" for the attack on his officers.\n\nHowever, the Jalisco cartel has grown much more powerful in recent years and there have been no significant victories against them by either the state or federal government, the BBC's Will Grant in Mexico City reports.\n\nWhat's the background to this?\n\nDespite the government's efforts to tackle drug crime, last year saw a record number of murders with over 29,000 recorded.\n\nWorse still, this year could be set to surpass that figure.", "description": "The attack is believed to have been carried out by a drug cartel in western Michoac\u00e1n state.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/179B/production/_109234060_mexicopolice.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
