Jury selection in the drug trafficking trial of Tony Hernandez began Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2019, in U.S. federal court in Manhattan. U.S. prosecutors allege the 41-year-old used his government connections to smuggle U.S.-bound cocaine through Honduras. (AP Photo/Fernando Antonio, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A Honduran former mayor and drug trafficker testified Monday that Mexican kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n personally gave $1 million to the brother of Honduras' president in 2013 for the politician's presidential campaign.\n\nThe longtime Sinaloa cartel boss made the payment to be able to smuggle cocaine through Honduras to Guatemala, Am\u00edlcar Alexander Ard\u00f3n alleged in testimony on the fourth day of the Manhattan drug trial of Tony Hern\u00e1ndez, brother of President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2013 Tony Hern\u00e1ndez sold drugs to \"El Chapo\" and alleged helped him move shipments thanks to information he obtained from top Honduran officials, Ard\u00f3n said.\n\nJuan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez has vehemently denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged. Tony Hern\u00e1ndez's defense argues there is no evidence proving the charges.\n\n\"Any accusation that @JuanOrlandoH as a candidate for president may have received or accepted money from El Chapo directly or indirectly is 100% false, absurd and ridiculous,\" the Honduran presidency tweeted Monday. \"It is craziness like Alice in Wonderland.\"\n\nProsecutors said last week at the start of the trial that jurors would hear testimony about the purported bribe from Guzm\u00e1n.\n\nIn hours of testimony, Ard\u00f3n gave details of dozens of meetings with traffickers including with Guzm\u00e1n, whom he said he first met in 2007 and had seen six times through 2013.\n\nArd\u00f3n testified that in 2013, $1 million in bundles of $50,000 and $100,000 was put on the table during a meeting in the municipality of El Paraiso, where he was mayor, and delivered there to Tony Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\n\"We counted it,\" he said. \"It was in plastic bags.\"\n\nArd\u00f3n said several others were present at the meeting.\n\nHe also alleged that Guzm\u00e1n used six trucks from the broadcaster Televisa to transport drugs, and each vehicle had a capacity to carry 6,000 kilograms of cocaine.\n\nTelevisa said in a brief statement that the company was not aware of the specific nature of the testimony, \"but it would not be the first time they try to pass vehicles off as those of Mexican businesses. When we have been aware, the respective complaints have been presented.\"\n\nThe witness also said he met with the president and ex-President Porfirio Lobo to discuss payments.\n\nHe alleged that in 2008 Lobo asked for $2 million for his presidential campaign and for Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, who at the time was running for president of Honduras' congress.\n\nLobo has previously denied allegations against him, calling them \"falsehoods from criminals who are trying to reduce their sentences.\"\n\n\"I have not received money, I have not been, nor am I, nor will I be a friend, partner or much less a collaborator with any criminal,\" the ex-president said Friday on Twitter.\n\nArd\u00f3n, dressed in his prison uniform, acknowledged being responsible for 56 murders.\n\nThe trial is expected to last two weeks.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Peter Orsi in Mexico City contributed to this report.", "description": "A Honduran former mayor and drug trafficker testified Monday that Mexican kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n personally gave $1 million to the brother of Honduras' president in 2013 for the politician's presidential campaign.
