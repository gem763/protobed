He said the hastily announced U.S. pullback this time could prove a boon to an ISIS movement that had been on the run.\n\n\u201cMaybe Trump should have thought about this before he basically made a decision that unraveled the tapestry that had been working pretty well,\u201d said Mr. McGurk at an event hosted by the Foundation for Defense of Democracy.\n\nMr. Trump says he withdrew troops to fulfill his campaign pledge of bringing troops home from foreign entanglements, yet the soldiers are being reassigned to new places in the region.\n\nMr. McGurk\u2019s comments came as Mr. Trump insisted that the cease-fire along the Turkey-Syria border is \u201cholding\u201d and hinted at a potential deal with oil companies or some other kind of \u201ccash flow\u201d to safeguard oil resources inside Syria.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper suggested Monday that a small U.S. force may stay behind to guard oil fields in the region, the bulk of the 1,000 American troops are now exiting Syria and heading to Iraq.\n\nMr. McGurk hit back at the notion that the U.S. could employ a company to \u201cexploit\u201d the region\u2019s oil resources \u201cunless we want to be oil smugglers, and that\u2019s not something the United States of America is into.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur ability to affect the course of events in Syria, particularly now, are extremely limited,\u201d Mr. McGurk added. \u201cAnd trying to do more I think, we\u2019re going to dig the hole even deeper.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
