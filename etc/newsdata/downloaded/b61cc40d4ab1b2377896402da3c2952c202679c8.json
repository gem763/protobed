Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in Corona, New York, on Thursday took an unexpected turn when a woman\u2014allegedly a constituent\u2014began talking about the dire state of the climate during the Q&A and how the only remedy is cannibalism.\n\n\"We're not going to be here for much longer because of the climate crisis! We only have a few months left! I love that you support the Green Deal but getting rid of fossil fuel is not going to solve the problem fast enough,\" she said.\n\n\"I think your next campaign slogan has to be this, we got to start eating babies.\"\n\nThe woman then took off her outer coat to reveal a t-shirt that said \"Save the Planet, Eat the Children\".\n\n\u201cYou are so great. I\u2019m so happy that you really support the Green New Deal,\u201d she told AOC. \u201cBut it\u2019s not enough, you know. Even if we would bomb Russia, we still have too many people, too much pollution.\n\n\u201cSo we have to get rid of the babies \u2013 that\u2019s a big problem. Just stopping having babies is not enough. We need to eat the babies.\u201d\n\nOne of Ocasio-Cortez's constituents loses her mind over climate change during AOC's townhall, claims we only have a few months left: \"We got to start eating babies!

We need to eat the babies!\" pic.twitter.com/uVmOnboluI \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 3, 2019\n\nWhile Ocasio-Cortez looked uncomfortable during the situation, she never condemned the woman, later explaining on Twitter that she was \u201cconcerned\u201d about the \u201cwoman in crisis\u201d and made sure to \"treat the situation compassionately.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis person may have been suffering from a mental condition and it\u2019s not okay that the right-wing is mocking her and potentially make her condition or crisis worse,\u201d she said. \u201cBe a decent human being and knock it off.\u201d\n\nThis person may have been suffering from a mental condition and it\u2019s not okay that the right-wing is mocking her and potentially make her condition or crisis worse. Be a decent human being and knock it off. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 4, 2019\n\nDuring the event, she responded by reassuring the woman we have \u201cmore than a few months.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we all need to, to understand that there are a lot of solutions we have, that we can pursue. And that if we act in a positive way, there\u2019s space for help. There\u2019s \u2013 we are never beyond hope.\u201d\n\nThe incident set Twitter ablaze, with some believing the woman was sincere, while others thought she was a GOP troll.\n\nDon. Jr and President Trump even commented on the story.\n\nAOC is a Wack Job! https://t.co/LU3hIeek0c \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2019\n\nIf she actually beleived what she was saying, she wouldnt have covered up the shirt till then. It's completely a plant by the GOP \u2014 Fastr (@fastr7) October 4, 2019\n\nAOC:\n\n\n\n-We only have 12 years left!\n\n-People should not have kids because of the climate!\n\n-Need to get rid of cows!\n\n-Miami might be destroyed soon!\n\n-This is our WWII!\n\n\n\n*One of AOC's constituents has a meltdown over the climate, suggests eating babies*\n\n\n\nAOC: Don't talk about it! pic.twitter.com/95Bg5sKIPg \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 4, 2019\n\nThis woman was absolutely a plant from the Republican Party \u2014 Greg C (Bernie 2020) (@greg06897) October 4, 2019\n\nI like how she doesn\u2019t explicitly rule out the baby eating ?? \u2014 Allie Beth Stuckey (@conservmillen) October 4, 2019\n\nLook at those people's expressions sitting near her when she says all of this--nothing, no emotion at all. That is what is scary. \u2014 Missy Johnson ???? (@MissyJo78926609) October 4, 2019\n\nThis is how far gone the Democratic Party is. This is what climate alarmism leads to. She looks dead serious about eating babies as a way to solve climate change. Even IF she ends up proven to be a troll, how sad is it that this is plausible & AOC responds as if it\u2019s real? \u2014 Robby Starbuck (@robbystarbuck) October 4, 2019", "description": ".10/04/2019 8:29:03AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/277/533cc6d8-1ab1-47bc-9832-80bf830d4aab.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
