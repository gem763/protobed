Our conclusion is sobering: debt owed by firms unable to cover interest expenses with earnings, which we call corporate debt at risk, could rise to $19tn. That is almost 40% of total corporate debt in the economies we studied.\u201d\n\nRegulations for banks have been tightened up since the financial crisis of 2008 but the IMF says risk has migrated elsewhere, including to the corporate sector. It believes countries need to look again at giving tax breaks on debt interest payments, which it believes encourages companies to raise money through borrowing.\n\nAdrian and Natalucci said the cheap money policy adopted by central banks was helping to boost financial markets in the short-term but, by encouraging investors to take more chances in the quest for higher yields, risked instability and lower growth in the medium-term.\n\n\u201cInvestors have interpreted central bank actions and communications as a turning point in the monetary policy cycle. About 70% of economies, weighted by GDP, have adopted a more accommodative monetary stance. The shift has been accompanied by a sharp decline in longer-term yields. In some major economies, interest rates are deeply negative. Remarkably, the amount of government and corporate bonds with negative yields has increased to about $15tn,\u201d the pair said.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\n\n\nOver the past six months, they added, vulnerability had increased among financial institutions that are not classified as banks, such as pension funds and insurance companies. Risks were \u201celevated\u201d in 80% of economies, as measured by GDP, with systemically important financial sectors \u2013 a similar level to the height of the financial crisis.\n\n\u201cVery low rates have prompted institutional investors like insurance companies, pension funds and asset managers to reach for yield and take on riskier and less liquid securities to generate targeted returns,\u201d Adrian and Natalucci said.\n\n\u201cFor example, pension funds have increased their exposure to alternative asset classes like private equity and real estate. What are the possible consequences? Similarities in portfolios of investment funds could amplify a market sell-off, and illiquid investments by pension funds could constrain their traditional stabilising role in markets. In addition, cross-border investments by life insurers could provoke spillovers across markets.\u201d", "description": "Update on markets lists eight leading countries, including US, China and UK, as vulnerable", "authors": ["Larry Elliott", "Kenneth Rogoff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b881cd3bc9be5126bb567b11151895ba28a5d57/9_60_1279_767/master/1279.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=619fd777fb32cab399732c096da783b2", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
