Her advice to colleagues: \u201cIf you\u2019re not on a committee of jurisdiction, go and work on legislation.\u201d\n\nMs. Spanberger made a similar pitch. \u201cWe are focused on all of these top priority issues,\u201d like education and health care, she said. \u201cMy appeal to my colleagues is just: Let\u2019s make sure that is known.
