The numbers are actually higher this week, most of which XRP spent trading sideways. Since the rally we last discussed, it\u2019s up 8.83%, but the rise is particularly prominent in the last 24 hours \u2013 or the last several hours to be more precise \u2013 during which the price went up by 5.83%.\n\nXRP now (7:35 UTC) stands at USD 0.29, which is its highest price in the past week. The lowest is USD 0.26, which it hit several times during the course of the past seven days. Nevertheless, when we observe its last month, there is a clear, though irregular rise starting at the end of September, having rallied on September 30th, then again on October 7th, but still being on an upwards trajectory, despite the drops following each rally.\n\nXRP price chart:\n\nComparing XRP to the other coins on the entirely green top 10 list, we find Binance Coin (BNB) leading the list with the highest and the only double-digit percentage climb in the last week of 20%. The least to appreciate is Bitcoin Cash (BCH) with 0.83%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is somewhere in the middle, being up 5.37%.\n\nThe situation is different when ranking these coins based on their performance in the past 24 hours. XRP clearly leads here, with BNB in the second place with 4.39%. While BTC is unchanged, the only one in the red here is Bitcoin SV (BSV), which dropped 1.22%.\n\nIn the last week, Ripple came out with several announcements:\n\nRipple partnered with London-based financial technology company Finastra ; Ripple\u2019s blockchain technology will be offered through Finastra\u2019s payments solutions to support fast cross-border payments. Finastra\u2019s customers will have access to RippleNet, hence to On-Demand Liquidity too, and they\u2019ll be able to connect and transact with more than 200 financial institutions worldwide that are RippleNet partners, the announcement says, while the partners can access Finastra\u2019s global footprint.\n\n; Ripple\u2019s blockchain technology will be offered through Finastra\u2019s payments solutions to support fast cross-border payments.
