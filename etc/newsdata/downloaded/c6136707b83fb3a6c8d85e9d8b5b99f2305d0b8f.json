If they want to b***h about movies it\u2019s certainly their right. It seems so disrespectful to all the people who work on those films who are working just as hard as the people who are working on their films and are putting their creative souls on the line just like they are,\u201d Iger said of filmmakers\u2019 comments. \u201cAre you telling me that Ryan Coogler making \u2018Black Panther\u2019 is doing something that somehow or another is less than anything Marty Scorsese or Francis Ford Coppola have ever done on any one of their movies? Come on.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Jon Favreau on Scorsese and Coppola's Marvel Criticism: 'They Can Express Whatever Opinion They Like'\n\nIger says he holds Coppola and Scorsese in \u201cthe highest regard,\u201d but he took issue with Coppola\u2019s characterization of the films as \u201cdespicable,\u201d and that he\u2019d only reserve that word \u201cfor someone who had committed mass murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Francis uses the words \u2018those films are despicable,\u2019 to whom is he talking? Is he talking to Kevin Feige who runs Marvel, or Taika Waititi who directs or Ryan Coogler who directs for us or Scarlett Johansson,\u201d Iger said. \u201cI don\u2019t get what they\u2019re criticizing us for when we\u2019re making films that people are obviously enjoying going to because they\u2019re doing so by the millions.\u201d\n\nScorsese recently doubled down on his comments when he said that Marvel movies were not cinema and compared them to \u201ctheme parks.\u201d He ultimately said that Marvel\u2019s films were \u201cinvading\u201d movie theaters and replacing what young people\u2019s idea of cinema is, even driving out smaller films and more human stories from the popular culture.\n\nAlso Read: After Coppola Slam, James Gunn Defends Marvel Movies as Cinema (Again)\n\nKen Loach, the British director behind \u201cKes\u201d and the recent \u201cSorry We Missed You,\u201d more specifically attacked the commercialism of Marvel films rather than their content specifically.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re made as commodities like hamburgers, and it\u2019s not about communicating, and it\u2019s not about sharing our imagination,\u201d Loach told Sky News. \u201cIt\u2019s about making a commodity which will make a profit for a big corporation \u2013 they\u2019re a cynical exercise. They\u2019re a market exercise, and it has nothing to do with the art of cinema. William Blake said, \u2018When money is discussed, art is impossible.'\u201d\n\nIger however had a response for that as well, saying that there\u2019s a mutual benefit in the success of the Marvel films and other blockbusters that allows movie theaters to exhibit movies that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be as financially successful.\n\nCheck out Iger\u2019s full comments via WSJ.\n\nRead original story Bob Iger Compares \u2018Black Panther\u2019 to Scorsese and Coppola Films in Defense of Marvel Movies At TheWrap", "description": "Disney CEO Bob Iger was the latest to leap to the defense of Marvel movies in the recent civil war among filmmakers over the blockbusters, pointing to Ryan Coogler\u2019s Best Picture-nominated \u201cBlack Panther\u201d as worthy as being called \u201ccinema\u201d as any film Martin Scorsese or Francis Ford Coppola have made.Iger", "authors": ["Brian Welk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zRqpSBE43SIOTdRPbjV39w--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thewrap.com/22cb0ed1ddcee537ed1cb4888393402d", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
