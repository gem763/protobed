But quizzed by ITV's Good Morning Britain, she defended the royals.\n\n(Image: Good Morning Britan)\n\nMs Villiers said: \"I think the international work done by our royal family has huge benefits, both in terms of campaigns like climate change and in terms of promoting the UK overseas.\n\n\"So I wouldn't want to discourage the royal family from taking flights.\n\n\"But absolutely, as a country as a whole, we need to find solutions which decarbonise our economy. And one of the ways we get to net zero is by nature-based solutions, by planting more trees and protecting biodiversity which is exactly what this Bill is designed to do.\"\n\nThe royal couple took four private jets in 11 days earlier this summer - while speaking about the dangers of climate change.\n\nPrince Harry later said he used the private jets \"occasionally\" when there was \"a unique circumstance to ensure that my family are safe.\"\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAsked again about Prince Harry's use of private jets, Ms Villiers said: \"I think the important thing is that our royal family are able to travel the world to promote the UK.\n\n\"Whether they do it in private jets or in other forms of aviation, I don't think is the most significant issue.\n\n\"It's a matter for the royal family how they choose to travel.\"\n\n(Image: Good Morning Britan)\n\nQuizzed again she claimed: \"Any one individual, ourselves, through our own personal choices, is not going to make the difference one way or the other.\n\n\"That's why we need a concerted plan to protect our environment and the legally binding targets we're going to be setting under the legislation published today.\"\n\nTargets to curb toxic air pollutants will be among a series of legally binding goals to improve the environment in the new Bill.\n\nAnd a new watchdog - the Office of Environmental Protection, based in Bristol - will scrutinise laws, investigate complaints and take enforcement action against public authorities to uphold standards.\n\nYet the long-awaited Bill is not likely to make progress in Parliament because a general election is expected to be called in the coming weeks or months.", "description": "Theresa Villiers said it doesn't matter what type of plane the Royals use, hours after unveiling a flagship Environment Bill to help the planet", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Good Morning Britan", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20582840.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Tory-Environment-Secretary-says-its-fine-for-Prince-Harry-to-use-private-jets.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
