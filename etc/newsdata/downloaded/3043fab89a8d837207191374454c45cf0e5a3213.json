It's up to you whether you take money to promote lies.\"\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nFacebook appears to have a new strategy to deal with the criticism from one of its highest-profile critics, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate \u2014 but it doesn't seem to have had the intended effect.\n\nDays after Warren called out Facebook's decision to allow political ads containing misinformation by running one of her own, Facebook made the unusual move of tagging her in a tweet about how broadcast stations across the country also aired an anti-impeachment Trump campaign ad containing misinformation about Joe Biden, a Democratic candidate.\n\nThe interaction is notable, as Facebook is not known for engaging directly with presidential candidates on public platforms.\n\nWarren recently criticized Facebook's policies that don't allow politicians to swear on the platform but do allow them to run ads that don't pass a third-party fact-check.\n\nThe ad Facebook referenced in its tweet \u2014 and currently allows on its platform \u2014 claimed that Biden \"PROMISED Ukraine $1 BILLION DOLLARS if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son's company.\"\n\nWarren, seeing an opportunity after Facebook tagged her in the tweet, seized it.\n\n\"You're making my point here,\" she responded. \"It's up to you whether you take money to promote lies.\"\n\nWarren said the ad violated Facebook's own misinformation policies prohibiting information debunked by fact-checkers.\n\nSince 2016, Facebook has had a \"newsworthiness exemption\" allowing content that violates community standards if the company believes that \"the public interest in seeing it outweighs the risk of harm.\" Notably, this exemption does not apply to swearing, and Facebook's policies for ads aren't as strict as those for the rest of its content. Facebook removed a Trump campaign ad that referred to Biden as a \"b----\" because it violated profanity standards for ads on the platform.\n\nIn response to Warren's and Facebook's tweets, some Twitter users pointed out that Facebook compared itself to broadcast networks, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission and legally liable for the content they air \u2014 something Facebook isn't on the hook for.\n\nFacebook's tweet did not seem to garner the response it had hoped for. Many replied that Facebook's comparing its practices to those of a broadcast network didn't make sense, as it has painstakingly tried in recent years to tell the tech press and regulators that it isn't a media company. Others said they wanted to delete Facebook.\n\nFacebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment.", "description": "Facebook tried to make a point about freedom of speech, but Warren shot back, saying, \"It's up to you whether you take money to promote lies.\"", "authors": ["Mary Meisenzahl"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da496a0cc4a0a5abe099cc4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
