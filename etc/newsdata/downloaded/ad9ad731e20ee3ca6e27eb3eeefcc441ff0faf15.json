Just nine high school football players out of every 10,000 will get drafted by a pro team. Shaquem Griffin didn't just beat those odds, he made history. Griffin became the first one-handed player in the modern era of the NFL. You may have heard some of his story, but what you may not know is how Shaquem Griffin ended up playing on the same NFL team as his twin brother, Shaquil. As we first reported last fall, it wasn't by chance. The brothers made a secret pact as children. A promise no one would have blamed them for breaking.\n\nThere's nothing complicated about Shaquem Griffin's approach to football. Number 49 zeros in on his opponents with the speed and impact of a tomahawk missile.\n\nShaquem and Shaquill Griffin CBS News\n\nSpend some time looking at his college highlights and you can see how the absence of a left hand forced Griffin to develop an ideal tackling technique.\n\nHe targets the ball carrier's hip and drives his shoulder in as he whips his arms around him to make the tackle. Once his sights are set. There is no escape.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: People can't believe how good you are with one hand. How good would you be with two hands?\n\nShaquem Griffin: I probably wouldn't be that good.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Why?\n\nShaquem Griffin: I thought about it. I was like, \"If I had two hands I don't think I'd be good as I am now.\" I think me having one hand made me work even harder than many other people.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: What do you mean by that?\n\nShaquem Griffin: I feel like if you only put one hour in, I probably need to put in an hour and 30, or I need to put in two hours.\n\nShaquem Griffin plays linebacker and on special teams for the Seattle Seahawks. His teammate in Seattle, and in life, is his identical twin Shaquill.\n\nThey can be hard to tell apart.\n\nShaquem is on the left of your screen and that's Shaquill on the right. He is one of the best cornerbacks in the league.\n\nShaquem Griffin: As a brother, he's very protective and he takes his being a big brother role very seriously.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: But how much of a big brother is he? You're twins.\n\nShaquem Griffin: 60 seconds. Be he makes it feel like its been years since he's been born. he does good at his job I guess because he thinks it's a job being a big brother.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Do you think it's a job being a big brother?\n\nShaquill Griffin: Yes, well, if you're his big brother. It's definitely a job.\n\nWe first met the twins at a family reunion in Atlanta, where they were sporting matching t-shirts and smiles.\n\nTangie Griffin\n\nBut back at the home they shared in Seattle, they bickered like only brothers can. It took all of five minutes before a friendly ping pong match became an argument over the score.\n\nShaquem Griffin: So what I got?\n\nShaquill Griffin: I got 8-3. I got one more serve.\n\nShaquem Griffin: 8-3? No it's my serve. It's 8-4. I knew you would try to lie. Give me the ball.\n\nShaquill Griffin: You said you got five.\n\nShaquem Griffin: Yeah, I thought you had seven.\n\nThis constant competition has been going on since they were toddlers.\n\nShaquill Griffin: You know, I'll give you an extra point.\n\nShaquem Griffin: So it's on me.\n\nShaquill Griffin: I got points to spare.\n\nShaquem Griffin: That's five.\n\nShaquill Griffin: I was just te-- You see? You see what I go through? You see what I go through?\n\nSharyn Alfonsi:: What were they like as two-year olds?\n\nTerry Griffin: Whooey. One'd go that way. One'd go that way.\n\nTerry Griffin is their dad. Tangie is their mom. When the twins weren't pounding on each other they were wrecking their house in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nTerry and Tangie Griffin CBS News\n\nTerry Griffin: Sports was more or less s-- something to take some of that energy.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: You needed to run them out.\n\nTerry Griffin: I needed to run them. I needed to run them. And they were so excited. They were like, \"Dad, can I--\" \"Run, boy. Run, (LAUGHTER) run, run, run. Matter of fact, you can run some. Give me a call when you're finished.\" (LAUGHTER)\n\nNothing slowed Shaquem down, including the birth defect that deformed his left hand. During pregnancy, small strands of tissue constricted his fingers. It's called amniotic band syndrome. The undeveloped hand caused him pain until it was amputated when he was four.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Did you ever think about getting him a prosthetic?\n\nTangie Griffin: I thought about it. And then I said, \"You know what? I'm-- I'm not gonna do it.\"\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Why?\n\nTangie Griffin: Because he started working and he didn't need it. You know, he was able to button up his shirt, and button up his pants, tie his shoes.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: How did you teach him, and I guess you probably taught him, how did you teach him to catch a ball without a hand?\n\nTerry Griffin: When you get hit in the face about five, six, seven, times, (LAUGH) you-- he used to, like--\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: You're going to figure it out real quick.\n\nTerry Griffin: Yeah, you'll-- you'll start catching. He wanted it. You have-- you gotta want it.\n\n\"We promised each other. Nothing will stop us. Nobody will interfere in what we want. And that's to be together.\"\n\nBut the Griffins told us not everyone wanted Shaquem on the field. Some opposing coaches didn't want a kid with one hand out there and told their players to target him. And then there were the looks.\n\nTangie Griffin: You have adults, they'll just stare instead of asking. And then the kids will ask, \"Well, what happened to your hand?\" \"Oh my daddy, we went fishing and a shark jumped up and bit my (LAUGH) hand off.\" So every time, he would always make a joke out of it. And that's just growing up. But Shaquill wasn't okay with it. Shaquill didn't think it was something to be teased about. He didn't even like the fact that when Shaquem would joke about it. And Shaquill protects him right now. He's very protective of his brother.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Shaquem is now 6'1\", 230-some pounds. Does he need protecting?\n\nTangie Griffin: He doesn't need protecting, but Quill doesn't feel like he doesn't.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Still.\n\nTangie Griffin: Still.\n\nBy the time they were teenagers, Terry Griffin was designing contraptions to allow his one-handed son to do the same demanding weightlifting as his twin brother. This one was called \"the book.\"\n\nShaquem Griffin: It's literally like-- a block of wood, a book, and then a sock over it.\n\nShaquill Griffin: On top of it.\n\nShaquem Griffin: And then, like, a small block on top of the sock-- where it kinda-- kinda clips or hooks to the bar. My brother can hold-- hold it and guide it.\n\nLifting was followed by daily backyard drills dreamt up, and directed, by their father.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: What did the neighbors think was going on at the Griffin (LAUGH) house?\n\nShaquem Griffin: Like we're getting ready for war. There was so much stuff (LAUGH) going around. You got us in the backyard jumping over bricks. And--\n\nShaquill Griffin: A lotta yelling.\n\nShaquem Griffin: A lotta (LAUGHTER) yelling. And oh my goodness. The dog was screaming.\n\nShaquill Griffin: They knew we were training for something serious.\n\nShaquem Griffin: Yeah!\n\nShaquem Griffin with correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi CBS News\n\nThe twins became high school football stars: Shaquill with finesse, Shaquem with the speed of a running back and a ferociousness that earned him the nickname \"beast.\"\n\nTerry Griffin: Quem would tackle you on top of the Gatorade and give you a cup.\n\nBut when college scouts came calling, they only offered a football scholarship to Shaquill. What those coaches didn't know is that Shaquill wasn't going anywhere without Shaquem. The twins had made a pact to stay together.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: When did this happen? How old were you?\n\nShaquill Griffin: We probably had to be, like, eight.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Okay, but eight-year-olds say a lot of things and don't mean it. That-- that made perfect sense when you were eight years old. But the offers start coming in. And what did-- you wanted to go to Miami. Is that right?\n\nShaquill Griffin: Yeah.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: That was the dream?\n\nShaquill Griffin: Uh-huh.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: And?\n\nShaquill Griffin: I remember doing the interview. And I was talking about, you know, \"Just don't offer me. If you don't offer my brother, don't offer me. Because I'm not leaving him.\"\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Why wouldn't you leave without him?\n\nShaquill Griffin: I don't know. I think I wouldn't be the same if I went alone.\n\nTangie Griffin: And he was offered Florida State, Miami--\n\nTerry Griffin: LSU.\n\nTangie Griffin: LSU. The-- the top schools in the country. And Shaquem was like, \"Look, man. Go ahead. I'll be all right.\" And Quill said, \"No, we made a pact. We promised each other. Nothing will stop us. Nobody will interfere in what we want. And that's to be together.\"\n\nBrotherly love: Shaquem and Shaquill Griffin's pact\n\nIt was the University of Central Florida that gave the Griffins what they wanted: twin scholarships. But while Shaquill became a star, Shaquem was stuck on the bench and told by coaches he'd only be a shadow of his brother.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: How close were you to quitting?\n\nShaquem Griffin: I was really close.\n\nShaquill Griffin: You get to a point where he said, \"I was leavin',\" and I was gonna leave too. And then I think he ended up staying because he knew how much it would affect me. I said, \"If you leave then you's just breaking everything we promised to each other.\"\n\nIt took a coaching change to give Shaquem a fresh start. He spent his last two years in college playing like a man possessed, determined to destroy doubt or anything else in his path. His stats were phenomenal: 18 sacks, 195 tackles and this fumble recovery he scooped up for a touchdown. The one-handed player also made three interceptions.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Show me how you do it.\n\nShaquem Griffin: I mean, it's no, like, science to it. Catch it, got it in, and put pressure against it. Because obviously when you catch a ball you're going to put pressure with this hand, and then with this one I gotta make sure I compensate it. So I put pressure against it and make sure I grab it, squeeze, hold on tight to it.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: And bring it on in.\n\nShaquem Griffin: Bring it on in.\n\n\"Whatever there was that might have held him back, he overcame it in some other way.\"\n\nDespite being named the defensive player of the year in his conference, Shaquem Griffin was not invited to the NFL combine, a showcase for players looking to go to the pros. Shaquill was furious. He had graduated a year earlier and was a star rookie on the Seahawks.\n\nShaquill Griffin: I feel like everything he accomplished, if he did it with two hands, he would have gotten invited to the combine first, he probably would have been a first-round pick.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: If he had two hands.\n\nShaquill Griffin: Every-- yeah, every box that you're supposed to check off that you want out an athlete, he did that.\n\nShaquill was determined to honor their pact. He went to work publically, he demanded his brother get a chance. Privately he lobbied his coaches in Seattle. The NFL recognized a good story when it saw one and invited Shaquem to the combine, where the strength, agility and speed he first developed in his backyard would face its most important test.\n\nShaquem Griffin: Once I got to that line, I thought about everything I-- that it took for me to even get there. From the doubt, to the negativity, to the coaches saying I wasn't going to be nothing. This is what gonna make your name right now.\n\nHe blew the doors off the place, the fastest 40-yard dash ever for a linebacker at the tryout. And the exact same time his brother ran a year earlier.\n\nSuddenly there was talk Shaquem Griffin would be selected by an NFL team as soon as the third round of the draft, but that came and went.\n\nShaquem Griffin: People don't wanna take a chance. And I just feel like that's what it was, it's like that in every single level I've been in, from little league to high school and college.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: How often do people underestimate you?\n\nShaquem Griffin: I get underestimated every single day.\n\nSeattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll CBS News\n\nBy the fifth round of the draft the family had retreated to a hotel. That's when the call finally came.\n\nTangie Griffin: So he gets up and goes to the bathroom. Soon as he went to the bathroom, phone started ringing. Shaquill looked down at the phone and he recognized the area code. And he jumped up. He grabbed the phone, jumped over some of my grandkids, and busted the door. He was like, \"I'm using the bathroom.\" He said, \"I don't care. I know this area code. Answer this phone!\"\n\nIt was Seattle coach Pete Carroll with news that Shaquem Griffin would join Shaquill on the Seahawks.\n\nPete Carroll: Shaq \u2013 you ok?\n\nShaquem Griffin: I can't breathe right now, I'm not going to lie to you.\n\nPete Carroll: He still can't breathe.\n\nShaquem Griffin: Oh my god.\n\nPete Carroll: This is a great moment--\n\nShaquem Griffin: Thank you so much.\n\nPete Carroll: --and we are really excited about it and we're expecting you to come in here and bust ass now, you know that, right?\n\nShaquem Griffin: Yes, sir. I'm going to give everything I got.\n\nPete Carroll: Congrats to your brother too and your family. I know everybody's really excited about this.\n\nJust watch this moment. Once again, nothing could come between the Griffin brothers.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: You've done this a long time. If anybody had said to you, you're going to draft a guy and he's got one hand. Would you have believed it?\n\nPete Carroll: No, I would not-- I would not have been able to imagine that. We studied him-- as hard as you could study a guy, we found that whatever there was that might have held him back, he overcame it in some other way.\n\nShaquem Griffin played every game last season. Mostly on kick returns, but he's bulked up and hellbent on earning more game time. It's a page right out of the griffin brothers playbook.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: When will you say, \"I've been successful?\"\n\nShaquem Griffin: To the point where, you know \u2013 it's not about me having one hand, it's about me being a great football player. Don't matter if I am playing on special teams, don't matter if I am playing linebacker, I want to be the best at what I am doing.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Not being known as the guy with one hand. You wanna be known as the guy who--\n\nShaquem Griffin: Yeah, three, four or five-time Pro Bowler, guy who-- the guy who's known for just having a nose for the ball. Like, that's the guy I wanna be.\n\nProduced by Guy Campanile and Lucy Hatcher.
