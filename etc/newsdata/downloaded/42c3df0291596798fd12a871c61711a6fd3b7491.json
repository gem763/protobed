He will be scarred for life\n\nPhotographs taken from the scene of the assault show the blood-soaked duvet and cushions inside the victim's flat.\n\nThe brute left the man in a pool of his own blood inside the flat before the victim's partner discovered him and contacted police, who scrambled an ambulance.\n\nTopp was arrested hours after the savage attack and later charged with wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm.\n\nA second man, aged 33, had also been arrested in connection with the attack but died before charges were brought in the case.\n\nIt could not be proved which of the men was responsible for biting off the victim's ear.\n\nIn a victim impact statement read out in court, Topp's victim said he had been unable to sleep as he 'could have died' in the brutal beating.\n\nThe 40-year-old said: 'This has affected me, when I go out I am watching as I don't want to be assaulted again.\n\nPhotographs taken from the scene of Topp's assault show the blood-soaked duvet and cushions inside the victim's flat\n\n'I have not been able to sleep. I was being friendly letting people stay in the flat and they have repaid me by attacking me.\n\n'The injuries I suffered left me in intensive care for four days on a ventilator and I realise I could have died if my partner had not have kicked the door in.'\n\nDetective Constable Emma Beadle, of Northumbria Police's Central CID, led the investigation and today branded Topp a 'dangerous offender'.\n\nShe said: 'I am delighted with the lengthy custodial sentence handed to Bradley Topp and I know the victim in this case is too.\n\n'This was a sustained attack on a man inside his own home and when it had come to an end, Topp left his victim there to die.\n\n'Thankfully the victim has been able to make a full recovery but he has been left scarred for life with part of his ear missing.\n\n'The physical injuries have since healed but this would be a traumatising incident for anyone and I know it has deeply affected him.\n\n'I hope he can take comfort from knowing that this violent and dangerous offender is behind bars and cannot do him any further harm.\n\n'The streets are safer with Bradley Topp in prison and I hope this sentence reassures the public about our commitment to putting violent offenders before the courts.'", "description": "Bradley Topp, 28, launched a frenzied assault on the unnamed 40-year-old victim inside his own flat on Barford Court, Gateshead, in February.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/09/20365926-0-image-a-6_1572426265897.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
