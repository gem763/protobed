USA TODAY\n\n\"Beat L.A.! Beat L.A.!\"\n\nPhoenix fans broke out a favorite chant as the Suns handed Kawhi Leonard and the Los Angeles Clippers their first loss of the season. Devin Booker scored 30 points, Kelly Oubre Jr. added 20 and the Suns prevailed 130-122 for their first win in the series in more than three years.\n\nPhoenix snapped a 12-game losing streak to the Clippers and won for the first time since losing starting center Deandre Ayton to a 25-game suspension after he tested positive for a diuretic.\n\nLos Angeles was led by Montrezl Harrell's 28 points. Leonard added 27 points, eight rebounds and 10 assists.\n\n\"Even if we had won the game, we had no business winning the game tonight,\" said Clippers coach Doc Rivers. \"They just played so much better. They were so much more committed to what they were doing. In every aspect of the game, I just thought they were better.\"\n\nHere's Doc Rivers' reaction to a tough loss to the #Suns in Phoenix.#ClipperNationpic.twitter.com/2Dko0bRmNf \u2014 FOX Sports West (@FoxSportsWest) October 27, 2019\n\nPlayer of the game: Booker. He battled through foul trouble, went nose-to-nose with top NBA defensive bulldog Patrick Beverley and led the Suns to an early statement victory that said they won\u2019t be a pushover this season.\n\nBooker finished with 30 points on 10-of-20 shooting with eight assists and six rebounds. He scored 16 points in the fourth quarter and hit all the clutch shots to lead Phoenix to the upset win.\n\nDevin Booker hits the 3 over Patrick Beverley and lets him hear it\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfa5: @HoHighlightspic.twitter.com/9eHCG1rn54 \u2014 USA TODAY NBA (@usatodaynba) October 27, 2019\n\nKey moments: Phoenix went on a 22-10 run to turn a slim 93-90 lead into a 115-100 advantage with 5:09 left in the game. That was the game closer.\n\nA minute later, fans started chanting, \"Beat L.A.! Beat L.A.!\"\n\nWhat did we learn about the Suns? The Suns are showing some serious resiliency early in the season.\n\nNo Deandre Ayton, who is out with the suspension. No Ricky Rubio, who injured his left knee in Friday night\u2019s overtime loss at Denver.\n\nNo rest as this was the second of a back-to-back, but the Suns took down perhaps the favorites to win it all this season \u2014 and did so with foul trouble all game. The Suns were called for 34 fouls, and four players had at least four, but they outworked the Clippers in this one.\n\nDario Saric showed he can shoot, hitting 3-of-6 from 3-point range after going 1-of-7 from deep in the first two games.\n\nAron Baynes remained solid in the post, reserve guard Jevon Carter had an eight-point stretch that changed the game in the third quarter, and Frank Kaminsky is perhaps the biggest surprise of the team, scoring inside and outside on the way to 18 point, eight rebounds and six assist.\n\nThen there\u2019s Booker.\n\nNow in his fifth year, he\u2019s often said that he\u2019s seen it all, but this isn\u2019t the same Booker. He\u2019s showing far more patience than even a season ago.\n\nHe's getting to the rim, not settling and trusting his teammates. He\u2019s also working out of the post and finding open shooters for 3s. The post-up game could really take his game to even another level because Booker is forcing the defense to adjust and has the option to either shoot or find an open man.\n\nBooker may have the luxury this season to have a bad shooting night while the team stays within striking distance to win. That happened Friday night in Denver.\n\nA day later, Booker scored 16 points in the fourth quarter and won the mano-a-mano matchup with Beverley.\n\n\"They played extremely hard. I give them a lot of credit,\" Beverley said. \"A team like this, you come into games and of course the bulls-eye is on our back. ... We needed this. It is not the end of the world. We have to get better and we will. We will get better for sure.\"\n\nThey started trash talking in the third quarter. Beverley dug in, but so did Booker. He didn\u2019t back down and got the last word when hitting a fadeaway jumper over Beverley, who picked up his sixth foul on the play midway through the fourth.\n\nBooker jumped up, screamed and celebrated with his teammates.\n\nThat was after getting called for four fouls, missing shots and having things not go his away. A season ago, Booker would\u2019ve let his emotions get the best of him, take bad shots and take himself out of the game.\n\nSo far this season, he\u2019s smiled through those moments and kept playing. Now, Booker has had a few chats with the officials, but he\u2019s finding a way to keep engaged in the game even when things aren\u2019t going his way.\n\nThe Arizona Republic is part of the USA TODAY Network.", "description": "Phoenix fans broke out the \"Beat L.A.!\" chant as Devin Booker and the Suns beat Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers their first loss of the season.", "authors": ["Duane Rankin", "Published A.M.
