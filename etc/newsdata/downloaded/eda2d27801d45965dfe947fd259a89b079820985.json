No areas of the fire have been contained yet.\n\nA man in his late 50s died in the hospital on Friday morning after going into cardiac arrest while talking to firefighters, the Los Angeles Times reported. One firefighter suffered a minor eye injury.\n\nMandatory evacuations around Sylmar\n\nThe mandatory evacuations affect neighborhoods north of the 118 freeway, according to the Los Angeles Times. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) has marked those areas on a live online map. The locations under urgent mandatory evacuation orders are highlighted in red, while \"evacuation warning\" areas are in yellow.\n\nThe area of Los Angeles under mandatory evacuation is highlighted in red, and evacuation warning areas are in yellow. Lafd maps\n\nIn a tweet, the LAPD said in those who live in the yellow zones should \"be prepared to evacuate immediately if needed.\"\n\nFour evacuation centers are available to people leaving their homes: Mason Park, Granada Hills Recreation Center, Lanark Recreation Center, and Northridge Recreation Center. Three of them had gotten full earlier on Friday morning but have since re-opened their doors.\n\nThe Sylmar Recreation Center closed its doors to new arrivals as of Friday around noon.\n\nPortions of four major freeways (the 5, the southbound lanes of 14, northbound 405, and the 210 in both directions) have been closed. Service on the Metrolink and Surfliner trains has been disrupted.\n\nLos Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore told the LA Times that he had seen some residents fighting flames with garden hoses on their properties. He urged residents to evacuate instead.\n\n\"Those individuals placed not only themselves in imminent peril, but they placed first responders such as police and fire officials in that same perilous condition because of our need and desire to go in and try to rescue them,\" Moore said.\n\nHotter temperatures fuel bigger fires\n\nIn recent years, warmer temperatures across the western US have caused more land to burn. Of the 10 largest wildfires in California history, nine have occurred since the year 2003.\n\nThe 2018 wildfire season was the deadliest and most destructive in California history: A total 7,500 fires burned over 1,670,000 acres \u2014 more land than any previous fire season. The Camp Fire, the deadliest wildfire in California history, killed 85 people and burned the entire town of Paradise in November.\n\nThat fire was caused by electrical transmission lines belonging to Pacific Gas & Electric, California's largest electric utility, Cal Fire determined after an investigation in May. To prevent another such disaster, PG&E shut off power to 800,000 residents in northern California ahead of dry, windy conditions this week.\n\nThe wreckage of a vehicle is seen along the road in the aftermath of the Camp Fire in Paradise, California. Reuters\n\nCalifornia fire experts say the entire concept of a wildfire season might be outdated, since dangerous fires can occur at any time of year now.\n\n\"We're responding to wildland fires year round now,\" Cal Fire spokesman Scott McLean told the Sacramento Bee last year.\n\nExperts say that trend will continue as the effects of climate change keep getting worse. California's 2018 Climate Change Assessment report estimated that the average area burned in wildfires will increase 77% by the year 2100 if greenhouse-gas emissions continue to increase.\n\nA study published Tuesday also showed that warm, dry conditions are fueling more severe fires in the Sierra Nevada region.\n\nFlying embers cross over the hillsides from the Saddleridge wildfire in Sylmar, California, October 11, 2019. REUTERS/ Gene Blevins\n\n\"Our data show that climate has been the main driver of fire on a regional scale,\" Richard Vachula, the study's lead author, said in a release. \"We find that warm and dry conditions promote fire, which in light of climate model predictions suggests that future fires may be more extensive than we have observed in the last century.\"\n\nWhat's more, exceptionally wet winters are no longer tempering catastrophic summer fires, according to a study published in January.\n\n\"We're in uncharted territory,\" California Governor Jerry Brown said last year. \"Since civilization emerged 10,000 years ago, we haven't had this kind of heat condition, and it's going to continue getting worse.\"", "description": "No portion of the fire has been contained.
