Here\u2019s Some of the High Points\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Following is a set of extracts from the Political Declaration that forms part of the European Union and U.K.\u2019s Brexit deal. You can view the document in full here.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis declaration establishes the parameters of an ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership across trade and economic cooperation with a comprehensive and balanced Free Trade Agreement at its core, law enforcement and criminal justice, foreign policy, security and defence and wider areas of cooperation.\n\nThe Parties are agreed that the future relationship should be approached with high ambition with regard to its scope and depth, and recognize that this might evolve over time.\n\nTrade agreement\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Parties agree to develop an ambitious, wide-ranging and balanced economic partnership. This partnership will be comprehensive, encompassing a Free Trade Agreement, as well as wider sectoral cooperation where it is in the mutual interest of both Parties. It will be underpinned by provisions ensuring a level playing field for open and fair competition.\n\nTariffs\n\nThe economic partnership should through a Free Trade Agreement ensure no tariffs, fees, charges or quantitative restrictions across all sectors with appropriate and modern accompanying rules of origin, and with ambitious customs arrangements that are in line with the Parties\u2019 objectives and principles above.\n\nServices and Investment\n\nThe Parties should conclude ambitious, comprehensive and balanced arrangements on trade in services and investment in services and non-services sectors, respecting each Party\u2019s right to regulate. The Parties should aim to deliver a level of liberalisation in trade in services well beyond the Parties\u2019 World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments and building on recent Union Free Trade Agreements (FTAs).\n\nThe arrangements should therefore cover sectors including professional and business services, telecommunications services, courier and postal services, distribution services, environmental services, financial services, transport services and other services of mutual interest.\n\nFinance\n\nThe Parties are committed to preserving financial stability, market integrity, investor and consumer protection and fair competition, while respecting the Parties\u2019 regulatory and decision-making autonomy, and their ability to take equivalence decisions in their own interest. This is without prejudice to the Parties\u2019 ability to adopt or maintain any measure where necessary for prudential reasons. The Parties agree to engage in close cooperation on regulatory and supervisory matters in international bodies.\n\nNoting that both Parties will have equivalence frameworks in place that allow them to declare a third country\u2019s regulatory and supervisory regimes equivalent for relevant purposes, the Parties should start assessing equivalence with respect to each other under these frameworks as soon as possible after the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the Union, endeavouring to conclude these assessments before the end of June 2020. The Parties will keep their respective equivalence frameworks under review.\n\nThe Parties agree that close and structured cooperation on regulatory and supervisory matters is in their mutual interest.\n\nCapital movements and payments\n\nThe Parties should include provisions to enable free movement of capital and payments related to transactions liberalized under the economic partnership, subject to relevant exceptions.\n\nMobility\n\nNoting that the United Kingdom has decided that the principle of free movement of persons between the Union and the United Kingdom will no longer apply, the Parties should establish mobility arrangements, as set out below.\n\nIn this context, the Parties aim to provide, through their domestic laws, for visa-free travel for short-term visits.\n\nParties agree to consider conditions for entry and stay for purposes such as research, study, training and youth exchanges.\n\nThe Parties also agree to consider addressing social security coordination in the light of future movement of persons\n\nIn line with their applicable laws, the Parties will explore the possibility to facilitate the crossing of their respective borders for legitimate travel.\n\nLevel playing field\n\nGiven the Union and the United Kingdom\u2019s geographic proximity and economic interdependence, the future relationship must ensure open and fair competition, encompassing robust commitments to ensure a level playing field. The precise nature of commitments should be commensurate with the scope and depth of the future relationship and the economic connectedness of the Parties.\n\nThese commitments should prevent distortions of trade and unfair competitive advantages. To that end, the Parties should uphold the common high standards applicable in the Union and the United Kingdom at the end of the transition period in the areas of state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environment, climate change, and relevant tax matters.\n\nThe future relationship should also promote adherence to and effective implementation of relevant internationally agreed principles and rules in these domains, including the Paris Agreement.", "description": "What\u2019s in the Brexit Deal?
