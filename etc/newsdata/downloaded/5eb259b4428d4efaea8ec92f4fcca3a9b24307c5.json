Tattoos are often associated with organized crime in Japan, and people with tattoos are often banned at some bath houses and swimming pools.\n\n\u201cWe had someone coming in and giving us a heads-up about what we could expect in Japan,\u201d Lam said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of similarities in our cultures but when it comes to the tattoos \u2026 it\u2019s quite normal in our culture.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we are respectful and mindful to what the Japanese way is. We will be making sure that what we are showing will be OK.\u201d\n\nSamoa team manager Va\u2019elua Aloi Alesana told the Rugby World Cup website that the word tattoo originates from the Samoan word \u201ctatau, which means \u2018a must\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cSo every young boy, when he gets to a certain age, he gets a tattoo as a kind of passport to get into the group and serve the chiefs.\u201d\n\nAlesana said the wearing of the skin covering will depend on the training site.\n\n\u201cThere are some training venues that have allowed us to show our tattoos and some places where we can\u2019t, and for those places, we\u2019ve been given \u2018skins\u2019 to wear to cover our tattoos,\u201d he said. \u201cThe extra skins are only for when we go to the (swimming) pools though, at the training we can wear our normal clothes.\u201d\n\nSamoa will play Russia, Scotland, Japan and Ireland in Pool A, opening against Russia on Sept. 24 at Kumagaya.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Samoan rugby players will wear skin suits to cover their traditional tattoos during some training sessions at the World Cup in order not to offend their Japanese hosts.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
