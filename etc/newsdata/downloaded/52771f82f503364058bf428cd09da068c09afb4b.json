I just wanted the best for her and to be as happy as possible. It was all go go go, I had to do it,' she said in an interview.\n\nAsked if she had something to say to her child, she replied: 'I would say I'm so, so sorry.'\n\nIn cross-examination, Garda Declan Hartley agreed with defence counsel Patrick Gageby SC that the woman was a very good mother to her children and put them first.\n\nDr Sally Linehan, a consultant psychiatrist from the Central Mental Hospital, gave evidence that the woman first experienced mental health frailties in college.\n\nWhen her daughter was diagnosed with autism, she said she felt like it was the end of the world and could not accept she had a mild diagnosis, the court was told.\n\nThe woman's husband said that in the weeks prior to the event, she started texting everybody and saying the situation was catastrophic, explained the witness.\n\nShe had been experiencing depressive symptoms in the months leading up to the killing and experienced a 'morbid preoccupation' with the issue of her child's diagnosis, as well as irrational thoughts.\n\nThe woman's mental health deteriorated when her child's autism was diagnosed and she developed a conviction that she must kill her, said the witness.\n\nShe was experiencing a relapse of her depressive illness and was suffering from a mental disorder at time of the offence, she said.\n\nThe woman did not know what she was doing was wrong and was unable to refrain from committing the act, Dr Linehan continued, adding that she was satisfied the accused fulfils the criteria of not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\nThe trial continues today.", "description": "The woman, from Ireland, had googled 'mothers killing autistic children' and 'sentence for murder' on her phone before the incident in February 2018, the Central Criminal Court heard.", "authors": ["Sophie Law For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/09/20072914-0-image-a-6_1571819199912.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
