Each day, The Independent will be publishing a new story to shed light on people\u2019s experiences.\n\nIndividuals who have not experienced pregnancy or baby loss may have a basic understanding of what a miscarriage or stillbirth entails. However, there may still be a lot they don't know, perhaps due to the misconceptions that continue to surround miscarriage and stillbirth.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

That\u2019s the technical line where after that, it becomes a stillbirth,\u201d Karen states.\n\nRuth Bender-Atik, national director of the Miscarriage Association, explains that while many adults are aware of how common miscarriage is \u2014 occurring on average in one in four pregnancies \u2014 \u201cmost people assume everything is ok\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe never expect it to happen to us. That\u2019s part of the reason why actually miscarrying comes as such as terrible shock, because you really don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen to you,\u201d Ruth states.\n\nThe shock of miscarriage also leads some parents to assuming they may be at fault in some way, Tommy\u2019s midwife Kate Pinney explains.\n\n\u201cWe know the chances of it being something the parents did is almost negligible, but the first thing parents do is blame themselves,\u201d Kate says.\n\nA mother may not realise she has suffered a miscarriage\n\nThose who are aware of what a miscarriage entails may expect a woman who is suffering one to experience early symptoms such as spotting.\n\nHowever, it is possible for a pregnant woman to have experienced a miscarriage without realising, having not exhibited any symptoms. This is called a \u201cmissed miscarriage\u201d.\n\nI found out the baby had stopped developing at seven weeks\n\n\u201cA \u2018missed\u2019 or \u2018silent miscarriage\u2019 occurs when the baby has died but the pregnancy hormones are still ongoing,\u201d Ruth outlines.\n\nNicola Rash, a 33-year-old lab manager from Suffolk, experienced two miscarriages. The first, which occurred on the same day Meghan Markle announced her pregnancy during Baby Loss Awareness Week in October 2018, was a missed miscarriage.\n\n\u201cEverything had seemed perfectly normal. I\u2019d got to 12 weeks pregnant and I\u2019d had all the symptoms of being pregnant. Then one day I was going to a meeting at work and I just felt like something wasn\u2019t right,\u201d Nicola says. \u201cI went to the loo and wiped and there was blood, so obviously I was quite alarmed, and then I started to have cramps.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Nicola called her early pregnancy unit and went in for a scan. \u201cI found out the baby had stopped developing at seven weeks. So I\u2019d been carrying it around in there for five weeks without knowing,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen a woman experiences a missed miscarriage, they are offered the option to take medicine to help speed up the process. This is called \u201cmedical management\u201d.\n\nAccording to baby charity Tommy\u2019s, medical management is a successful method in 85 per cent of cases of missed miscarriage. However, for some, like Nicola, surgery may also be required.\n\n\u201cI had to be rushed into surgery because I had retained tissue, which is something I didn\u2019t know could happen,\u201d Nicola says. \u201cIt\u2019s where your body hasn\u2019t expelled everything the first time round. It was all quite traumatic.\u201d\n\nStillbirth is more common than many may think\n\nAlyx Elliott, director of strategy at Petals, experienced the stillbirth of her daughter, Skye, at 37 weeks in 2017. Prior to her experience, Alyx was of the belief that stillbirth was something that no longer occurred in today\u2019s day and age.\n\n\u201cBefore I was pregnant with Skye, I thought stillbirth was something from the Victorian age and before that. I had no idea that it still happened,\u201d Alyx says. \u201cIt staggers me when you actually do look into it just how common it is.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, one in every 238 births in the UK was a stillbirth, charity Sands outlines. This equates to nine stillborn babies a day and around 3,200 stillbirths that year.\n\nDr Clea Harmer, chief executive of the stillbirth and neonatal death charity, explains that many people are under the assumption that the deaths of babies is \u201cjust one of those things\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe know that many other countries have lower rates of perinatal mortality than the UK and that there are things we can do to reduce the number of babies dying,\u201d Dr Harmer states.\n\nI completely thought I was safe\n\n\u201cOnce this misconception is addressed, we will be able to work together to better understand the reasons babies die and to put the necessary changes in place to reduce the perinatal mortality rate.\u201d\n\nAlice Bailey, a paediatric nurse, and Dave Bailey, an IT professional, experienced the stillbirth of their daughter Vera at 38 weeks in 2016. Dave says he believes the main cause of the \u201cstigma\u201d that surrounds stillbirth is that the fact people \u201cstill think it\u2019s rare\u201d.\n\nAlice adds she was previously \u201cguilty\u201d of thinking pregnant mothers in their last trimester were automatically \u201csafe\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf I saw someone who was in the last trimester I\u2019d be like, \u2018You\u2019re safe now, not far to go\u2019,\u201d Alice says. \u201cI remember when I was 37 and a bit weeks with Vera thinking, \u2018I\u2019m so uncomfortable, I just need to get this baby out.\u2019 I completely thought I was safe.\u201d\n\nEvery pregnancy and baby loss experience is different\n\nOne of the things that struck Nicola most about miscarriage through her own experiences was how different they can be.\n\n\u201cI always thought that it was just you get the impression that something\u2019s not right, and then you start cramping and you bleed, and then you pass the pregnancy,\u201d Nicola says.\n\n\u201cWhat I didn\u2019t realise was that it can drag on for so long, or that you can have miscarried so long before and not have a single clue. There\u2019s so many options and medical things you have to think of and deal with, like going for blood tests and choosing how to get rid of your pregnancy, and I just had no idea.\u201d\n\nRuth, of the Miscarriage Association, explains that it is important to consider the fact that not everyone reacts to miscarriage in the same way.\n\n\u201cFor many people, miscarriage is deeply distressing, it may be the worst thing that\u2019s happened to them so far in their life. But there are some people who simply say, \u2018You know what, I know miscarriage happens, it\u2019s one of those things. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be ok next time\u2019,\u201d she states.\n\nRuth also outlines how the portrayal of pregnancy and baby loss in film and TV can leave viewers with a misleading idea of what it can entail.\n\n\u201cYou get some really powerful portrayals, but I think the thing that people find the most difficult is when you have a highly dramatic miscarriage scene, which tends to show someone falling down the stairs or falling down in the street clutching their stomach in a pool of blood, which generally isn\u2019t how miscarriage happens,\u201d Ruth says.\n\nIn Alice\u2019s opinion, stereotypical depictions of baby loss in soap operas are frequently void of the emotional aftermath.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen it in a couple of soaps, and I just think it happens and then the couples always seem to recover very quickly,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThey never talk about the recovery side of things, there\u2019s never any counselling or anything. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve truly nailed how much it breaks you.\u201d\n\nMaternity wards have rooms dedicated to pregnancy and baby loss\n\nWhen one pictures a maternity ward, they would presumably visualise a hospital ward filled with pregnant women, their families and the sounds of crying, newborn babies.\n\nHowever, unless an individual has experienced pregnancy or baby loss, they may not realise that it is also the place where some parents first learn of and suffer the deaths of their babies.\n\nI could hear other babies being born and other babies crying\n\nPetals CEO Karen first started working as a baby loss counsellor in 2009. The early stages of her work involved working on the same maternity unit where she had given birth to her children several years prior.\n\n\u201cI suddenly walked through these places seeing through different eyes,\u201d Karen says. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise that part of the maternity ward where people were having their babies were one or two rooms where parents go whose babies are going to die, or have died.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a separate area of the maternity ward for this, but I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\nFollowing the death of her daughter Vera, Alice was looked after in the hospital for a few more days, an experience that she found very upsetting.\n\n\u201cI stayed in the hospital for I think another three days while I recovered, which was horrific because I was on the labour ward,\u201d Alice says.\n\n\u201cI could hear other babies being born and other babies crying. Horrific.\u201d\n\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, you can contact stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands on 0808 164 3332 or email helpline@sands.org.uk.
