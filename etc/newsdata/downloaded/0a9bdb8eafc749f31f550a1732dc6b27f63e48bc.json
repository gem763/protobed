They also said the siblings were raised by an abusive and bullying mother in a home with no beds, bare walls and little furniture.\n\nO\u2019Neill has already been sentenced to life imprisonment. The question for the judge to determine now is the what the minimum term should be before he is eligible for parole.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDefence barrister Greg Berry said that throughout the killer\u2019s childhood, and into adult life, he suffered manipulation, intimidation, bullying and threats by his mother.\n\nAnne was said to be extremely controlling (Picture: Northcliffe Collection)\n\nThe court heard that Anne was murdered between 6am and 7am with neighbours woken to the sounds of banging and screams for help.\n\nShortly later the first officer arrived and found Anne, 51, face down at the bottom of the garden in a pool of blood, hair and teeth.\n\nHer death, which a postmortem examination concluded was caused by a bleed to the brain with multiple skull fractures, was \u2018rapid but not immediate\u2019 pathologist Jack Crane concluded.\n\nHe added: \u2018She had been struck repeatedly on the head with a heavy blunt object and the back of her head had been pummelled against the edge of the tiles steps, and her face had been thrust against a hard, uneven surface such as the concrete path or patio,\u2019 Belfast Live reported.\n\nO\u2019Neill was arrested on suspicion of murder and taken to Musgrave Street police station where he was interviewed 19 times. He denied killing his mother until the 14th interview, when he broke down and said: \u2018I didn\u2019t mean to, I just couldn\u2019t take any more.\n\nDeclan\u2019s sister told the court he had no right to kill their mother but had no anger towards him (Picture: Northcliffe Collection)\n\n\u2018You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like. Every day thousands of pounds debt in my name. She keeps taking more money off me. Wants all my time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We [he and his partner] are not allowed any time together.\u2019\n\nAnne\u2019s blood was found in O\u2019Neill\u2019s Ford Fiesta. Also found in his flat were items stained with his mother\u2019s blood, including a rubber face mask, a metal chisel, shoes and gloves.\n\nDescribing the killing as \u2018brutal\u2019, Prosecutor Neil Connor said Anne\u2019s physical impairment made her vulnerable.\n\nHe also spoke of the level of pre-planning required on her son\u2019s part, highlighting the weaponry, mask and gloves. Though he did accept Anne\u2019s \u2018extremely controlling personality\u2019.\n\nAs youngsters Declan was not allowed to have friends and as an adult Anne would repeatedly phone him hospital (Picture: Metrograb)\n\nO\u2019Neill\u2019s lawyer told Mr Justice Colton that four medical assessments found the killer suffered from a depressive disorder.\n\nHe also said his client was \u2018struggling to come to terms with the consequences of his actions\u2019 and missed his mother.\n\nGovernment pauses \u00a3100,000,000 Brexit ad campaign to leave EU on October 31\n\nAnne\u2019s mother said in a statement that she believed her grandson did not intend to murder her daughter and that his \u2018mind must have just snapped\u2019.\n\nHis sister said: \u2018Declan has done wrong and he had no right to kill my mother, but I have no anger or resentment towards him.\u2019\n\nMr Berry also said as youngsters the siblings were not allowed to have any friends and that as an adult, when O\u2019Neill went to work as a doctor, Anne would repeatedly phone the hospital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Justice Colton said he would set the minimum term O\u2019Neill has to serve on November 4.
