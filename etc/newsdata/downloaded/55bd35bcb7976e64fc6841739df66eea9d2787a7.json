Pyongyang's top negotiator said he was \"greatly disappointed\" with Washington's inflexible approach.\n\nThe first substantive nuclear negotiations in months between North Korea and the U.S. broke down after just one day in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nNorth Korea's top nuclear envoy says the talks failed because the U.S. would not abandon its old approach. The U.S. quickly disputed that characterization, saying the 8-and-a-half-hour talks went \"good\" and that the U.S. brought \"creative ideas.\"\n\nThe breakdown raises the possibility North Korea will intensify its provocations, days after testing a new medium-range ballistic missile.", "description": "N.Korea Walks out of Nuclear Talks, Blaming U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/07/2019100700483_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
