Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nThe Republican Party controls the White House, the United States Senate, and the majority of governorships and state legislatures. Champions for the political project of conservatism \u2014 specifically, the people focused on shaping law and policy and winning elections for the GOP \u2014 control the Supreme Court and the most watched network on cable television, Fox News. From this perch, they\u2019ve pursued an agenda dedicated, in large part, to demonizing immigrants from Central America, the Caribbean, Africa, and the Middle East, while extolling the virtues of those from Europe; curtailing voting rights and seeking to reduce political representation for black and Hispanic people, for the express purpose of winning elections; and criminalizing abortion and reducing affordable health-care options in states where maternal and infant mortality rates are worse than in many less developed economies, especially for black women and children.\n\nThey\u2019ve advanced their cause by uniting behind a president, Donald Trump, who spouts racism and xenophobia as a matter of routine, but whose approval ratings among Republican voters nevertheless consistently top 80 percent. Whenever they\u2019re polled on the subject, large shares of these voters express bigoted views \u2014 40 percent think black people are \u201clazier\u201d than whites, nearly half think black people are more \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201cviolent,\u201d and close to 60 percent hold unfavorable opinions about Islam. This is to be expected: Racism has been fundamental to American conservatism, and the GOP in particular, since the mid-20th century realignment of the parties \u2014 even as its purportedly defining tenets have proven to be negotiable, from small government to antagonism toward autocrats to reduced deficit spending. None of this precludes the existence of non-racist conservatives, to be sure. It just makes them some of the least influential people in their movement, and renders their claims to broader relevance akin to shouting into a void.\n\nBut the void got slightly louder on Wednesday. Two op-eds by conservative columnists were published with essentially the same theme: American conservatism has a racism problem, and conservatives who care must build a movement that is unwelcoming to racists. The first, by Ross Douthat at the New York Times, uses this argument to qualify the real purpose of his piece, which is to lambast a handful of liberal commentators for falsely accusing four individual conservatives of being racists. The second piece, by Timothy P. Carney at the Washington Examiner, is more soul-searching. It documents his dismay at realizing the conservative movement has been an alarmingly hospitable home for racists; his recognition that racial disparities in America stem from racism; and his belief that \u201cthe right thing\u201d to do for conservatives is to scare away racists and make the best interests of nonwhite people central to their politics. Both cite Hannah Gais\u2019s Splinter expos\u00e9 about white nationalism run amok at conservative institutions, especially the Daily Caller, as evidence that the problem has gotten out of hand. And both call for inward-facing solutions: Douthat and Carney both insist that liberals will invent racism where it doesn\u2019t exist and call conservatives racist no matter what; conservatives therefore need to fight racism on their own terms, for and among one another, without worrying about what the other side says.\n\nThis casting of liberalism hinges on the belief that liberal accusations of racism are as cynical as conservative denial of them. It\u2019s an odd way of dismissing the very people who sounded the alarm about where the GOP was headed when much of the conservative intelligentsia was busy using op-ed pages and cable-news appearances to launder its descent. It\u2019s a tall order to thank one\u2019s political opponents for their honest assessment of you, to be fair. But the bigger problem for Douthat and Carney is that there\u2019s little evidence that a market for the brand of conservatism they\u2019re proposing exists \u2014 at least not in significant enough numbers to win elections and influence policy. Even assuming theirs is purely a moral imperative \u2014 one concerned more with doing the right thing than with victory \u2014 both writers are strikingly focused on minutiae: Their personal discomfort, the presence at once-respected conservative think tanks and online publications of individual white nationalists, and their dogged insistence that these realities don\u2019t actually represent conservatives, many of whom, they insist, aren\u2019t actually racist.\n\nChange has to begin somewhere, of course, and eradicating toxic elements from one\u2019s political movement is laudable, especially when you\u2019re fighting uphill against the majority. But the flagrant racism conveyed in Trump\u2019s speeches and Jonah Bennett\u2019s emails at the Daily Caller is less intractable than a movementwide mobilization behind a racist agenda. That Republicans have built a reliable coalition of racists and purported non-racists by pairing tax cuts and abortion restrictions with the subordination of black civil rights to states\u2019 rights suggests that even those who oppose racism are willing to overlook it for their own self-interest. They\u2019re fairly unremarkable in this respect \u2014 supporting a political movement often requires making peace with ideological differences.\n\nBut it also undermines the notion that conservatism\u2019s racism problem stems from infiltration by a few bad eggs. On the contrary, it\u2019s been apparent since the Nixon administration that the Republican Party would collapse without support from racists. Perhaps such a demise is Douthat and Carney\u2019s unstated goal. In any case, the GOP hasn\u2019t been able to convince most voters that corporate welfare, reduced protections for marginalized people, and diminished health-care options for all but the most financially secure are good things on their own terms, without using racism to sweeten the deal. This wouldn\u2019t matter if conservatism was a fringe ideology. But the writers\u2019 portrayal of their movement as one victimized by unfair smears and mischaracterization belies its status as the most powerful political movement in America today, and that conservatives control most of the country\u2019s most powerful political institutions.\n\nAs a result, the implementation of conservative policies means that migrant children are dying in cages, black voters are being purged from voter rolls by the thousands, Native lands are being plundered for oil infrastructure, and black mothers are losing their lives and babies because adequate health care is out of reach. It\u2019s unlikely that many of them are moved by the gradual awakening of some conservatives to what they\u2019ve known all along, or by Douthat and Carney\u2019s insistence that a more benign conservatism, of which they\u2019ve personally seen no evidence, exists. The mid-century black exodus from the GOP was no fluke or paranoid manifestation. It was a response to sustained antagonism toward their rights by Republicans. Rectifying this history will be a long and arduous task, as Carney acknowledges. But it starts with convincing everyday conservatives that it\u2019s a worthwhile pursuit. It will mean convincing majorities of Republican-leaning voters \u2014 most of whom currently deny racism\u2019s role in shaping society outright \u2014 that focusing on bigotry and its eradication is now a productive use of their time. But perhaps most important, it means reckoning with the fact that the movement\u2019s racism problem is not the result of a hijacking or a coup, but of popular will. There are no innocents among today\u2019s Republicans. There\u2019s only the ugliness they\u2019ve unleashed, and whether they\u2019ve the courage to risk political ruin in order to eradicate it.", "description": "A conservative movement that rejects racism is Tim Carney\u2019s goal, as his new Washington Examiner op-ed outlines.
