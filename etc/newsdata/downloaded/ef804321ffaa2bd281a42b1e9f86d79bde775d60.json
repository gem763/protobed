The residents find it fascinating as well,\u2019 she added.\n\nBristol-based historian Anthony Beeson told Stokeleigh that the works are \u2018certainly\u2019 the work of American G.I\u2019s.\n\nHe said: \u2018Several of the large houses in the area like Pitch and Pay were requisitioned for troops.\n\nDavid Parton, a staff member at Stokeleigh Care Home, who discovered a series of paintings (Picture: SWNS)\n\n\u2018Note that the bottle has \u2018rye\u2019 written on it which no Englishman would do. I suspect it was their mess room or the like.\u2019\n\nA second painting shows what appears to be a bulldog holding a bone, beside a musical stave with some musical notes painted on to it.\n\nMr Beeson added: \u2018The bulldog probably refers to the song \u2018Knick Knack paddywack\u2026give a dog a bone, this old man came rolling home\u2019, which would be very appropriate for a bar and also account for the notes.\u2019\n\nSadly, Alex said that the home will need to continue painting over the murals in order to prepare the room for its next resident.\n\nBut she said: \u2018We\u2019re planning on putting plasterboard over the mural and painting on to that, so that we can preserve the painting itself.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
