We will pause here to recall that Eric and Donald Trump Jr. make their living by running around collecting millions in hotel business from Republican supporters. Rudy Giuliani\u2019s son is serving as a public liaison assistant to President Trump. Moving forward.\n\nDuring his unending march through TV interviews, Giuliani declared that Trump never threatened to withhold Ukrainian aid unless he was given the goods on Joe Biden. Then added that he couldn\u2019t really \u201ctell you if it\u2019s 100 percent.\u201d The president\u2019s main confidant appeared to be saying there\u2019s a chance \u2014 10 percent? 30? 97? \u2014 that Trump actually did inform the head of a foreign government he wasn\u2019t going to get the military funding Congress had authorized unless he came up with some dirt on a potential presidential opponent. Wow.\n\nRudy and Donald have a lot in common. They\u2019ve both been married three times. Giuliani is now being sued for divorce by his latest spouse, who said he had turned into a \u201cdifferent man.\u201d A presumably less reliable version than the one who, as mayor, held a press conference to announce he was breaking up with his then-wife without ever notifying the person in question.\n\nAnyhow, current wife Judith Giuliani claimed that he had taken up with another woman, and that she could testify to his failings as \u201ca spouse and a nurse.\u201d Some Rudy-watchers wondered if that was a reference to his drinking. All we know for sure is that this is a guy who must make Donald Trump feel as if he\u2019s had an exceptionally righteous personal life.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot Trump likes about his pal. Undoubtedly including the way he\u2019ll yell \u201cShut up, moron!\u201d at a fellow panelist \u2014 even on Fox News.\n\nTrump forcefully defended Giuliani Wednesday when he was meeting with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky, a seemingly cheerful 41-year-old former TV star who very reasonably said he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to be involved\u201d in American politics. The two presidents seemed to get along very well. This was possibly because Zelensky has learned the importance at flattering Trump at every turn.\n\nOr maybe it\u2019s their joint show business background. Zelensky starred in a TV series about an idealistic teacher who winds up becoming \u2014 yes! \u2014 Ukraine president. Our experiment with entertainers hasn\u2019t been quite as successful. If only we\u2019d elected, say, Homer Simpson instead. The First Pal would have been an underemployed barfly, and the whole world would be much happier.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
