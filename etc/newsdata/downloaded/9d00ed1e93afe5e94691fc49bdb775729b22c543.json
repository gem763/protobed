Will others follow suit?", "language": "en", "text": "Some travelers would prefer to avoid sitting near a baby when they fly. Now, Japan Airlines has introduced a baby map to help.\n\nThe airline notes on its website that when passengers who travel with young children \u2014 those between the age of eight days and 2 years \u2014 choose on the site where they want to sit, a \u201cchild icon\u201d will be displayed on those spots on the seat selection screen.\n\n\u201cThis lets other passengers know a child may be sitting there,\u201d the website says on its \u201cbaby travel support service\u201d section.\n\nThe feature came to light when traveler Rahat Ahmed took an image of the baby map and thanked the airline on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThis really ought to be mandatory across the board,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThank you, @JAL_Official_jp for warnings me about where babies plan to scream and yell during a 13 hour trip. This really ought to be mandatory across the board.\n\n\n\nPlease take note, @qatarairways: I had 3 screaming babies next to me on my JFK-DOH flight two weeks ago. pic.twitter.com/kQYQFIqqCD \u2014 Rahat Ahmed \u2708\ufe0f Tokyo (@dequinix) September 24, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when the carrier introduced the feature. Japan Airlines has not responded to questions about the origin of the child icon or which flights it is used on. It is listed under domestic flights on the website, along with information about child seats, strollers, changing tables and blanket rentals. The airline also warns that the icon will not be shown if seats are booked as part of a tour, using award tickets or by some method other than the airline\u2019s website.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether any other airlines offer the same type of guidance: \u201cIt\u2019s a new one for us, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d says Natalie Arney, spokeswoman for the online travel agency Alternative Airlines. \u201cTo have that when you\u2019re booking just, like, blows you away, really.\u201d\n\nHer site offers a list of airlines that boast child-free zones, all of which are in Asia. They include the budget carriers AirAsia X, which sells a quiet zone where children under 10 are not allowed to sit, and Scoot, which advertises a \u201cScootinSilence\u201d zone on its Boeing 787 Dreamliners. The Singapore-based carrier promises an \u201cexclusive and silent cabin (no kids under 12 allowed here)\u201d in the section.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just being able to have somewhere quiet where you can sleep or where you can get on with your work and stay away from children,\u201d Arney says.\n\nTracy Stewart, content editor of TripAdvisor\u2019s family travel site Family Vacation Critic, said in an email that Japan Airlines\u2019 move was new and the first example he\u2019d seen of an airline showing where a child would be sitting on a map. He said quiet zones were not likely to become a global trend.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll likely never see something similar in the U.S. for fear of backlash,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nHow my wife and I have traveled with our kid, from 12 weeks old to toddler\n\nThe completely correct guide to reclining on an airplane\n\nHow did clapping on planes become such a divisive issue?", "description": "Japan Airlines' website puts icons on the plane seats where babies will be.
