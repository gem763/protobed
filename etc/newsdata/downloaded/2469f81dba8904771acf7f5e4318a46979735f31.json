Council President Kurt Wright, one of the two council members to vote against the measure, said he voted against the resolution because he believes voting is a privilege reserved for American citizens.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s important. I would not expect to move to another country and not become a citizen and expect to be voting in their elections,\u201d said Wright, a Republican. \u201cWe voted on this just a few years ago and the citizens of Burlington voted significantly against it so I\u2019m not supportive of this proposal.\u201d\n\nBurlington, which is the hometown of 2020 Democrat presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), is home to 42,000 people and is considered the largest city in Vermont, according to estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nIt also hosts the University of Vermont, which hosts at least 10,000 undergraduate students.\n\nThe resolution needs approval from the state legislature before it can become law, the Associated Press reported.", "description": "City council members in Burlington, Vermont, passed a resolution on Monday, which would allow non-citizens to vote in local elections.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/polling-day-voting-voters-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
