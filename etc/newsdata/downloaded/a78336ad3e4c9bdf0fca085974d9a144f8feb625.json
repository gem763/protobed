The FOMC is expected to cut rates this week, which is also market positive.\n\nThe Stats\n\nIt a quiet day on the Eurozone economic calendar on Monday. There were no material stats from the Eurozone to provide the EUR with direction on the day.\n\nFrom the U.S, stats were skewed to the positive providing support to the majors late on.

There are no material stats on the day to provide the majors with direction.\n\nThrough the early part of the European session, geopolitics will be in focus.\n\nLater in the day, economic data from the U.S will have some influence on the European majors.

We can also expect market reaction to Alphabet Inc\u2019s earnings release from Monday.
