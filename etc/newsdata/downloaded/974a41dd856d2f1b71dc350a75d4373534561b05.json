Hamza bin Ladin was responsible for planning and dealing with various terrorist groups,\" Trump continued.\n\nHamza Bin Laden's death was first reported last month, with reports citing anonymous U.S. officials. Trump had refused to comment on the matter.\n\nBin Laden was introduced as a voice of al-Qaida in August 2015 as \u201ca young lion to carry forth the cause.\u201d\n\nHis father, al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, was killed by U.S. forces in Pakistan in 2011.\n\nShortly after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept.11, 2001, that killed nearly 3,000 people, President George W. Bush declared that U.S. forces would get the al-Qaida leader \u201cdead or alive.\u201d", "description": "\"Hamza bin Ladin was responsible for planning and dealing with various terrorist groups,\" Trump said.", "authors": ["Christian Vasquez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lzvcW_4kyiatWztmbLVLOQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/slick_thumb/yahooNews-306384-1568469943610.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
