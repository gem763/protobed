The lawsuit was based on a German ancillary copyright law in force since August 2013.\n\nThe German court subsequently sought guidance from the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), Europe\u2019s highest.\n\nGermany has to notify the EU executive first for its ruling to take effect, ECJ judges said.", "description": "Google won a victory on Thursday after Europe's top court said Germany has to notify the European Commission of a rule allowing publishers to demand a copyright fee from the U.S. tech giant for using news snippets.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428984888&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0GB", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
