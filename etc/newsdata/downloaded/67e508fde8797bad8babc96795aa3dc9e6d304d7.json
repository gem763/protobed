Reduced mortgage availability after the financial crisis, and the need for buyers to find higher deposits, caused a sharp fall in the number of first-time buyers.\n\n\"People who have been renting privately and comfortably making their monthly payments are struggling to obtain a mortgage with the same or even lower monthly payments, while the near-disappearance of interest-only as a route to managing affordability has cut the number of options for first-time buyers.\u201d\n\nIn repsonse, IMLA has called on the Government to commission a new analysis to find out if the current mortgage rules are making things worse for renters by stopping them becoming first-time buyers.", "description": "Paying a mortgage works out an astonishing \u00a3352,500 cheaper than renting for 30 years, while a lifetime of rent is enough to buy three homes", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Getty", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article9373381.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/PROD-House-Prices-Are-Stagnant-In-London.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
