I allowed that October 1, the last day candidates can qualify for the next scheduled debate(s), would be a good time to begin putting a big ol\u2019 L out there for some of these people.\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t thinking about Bill de Blasio, who in this cycle is the exception to most rules, particularly those suggesting that having some sort of feasible electoral base is a prerequisite to a presidential run. The time to tell BDB to get out of the race was last month at the latest.\n\nThere\u2019s fresh evidence, in case it was needed, of Hizzoner\u2019s lack of presidential pizzazz, even (or particularly) among those who know him best: A new Siena College survey of the Democratic field shows him at zero percent in both New York City and New York State. Technically, I guess, he is tied for tenth in the city; three other candidates specifically mentioned in the poll also came across the line at zippo, nada, zilch in de Blasio\u2019s town. In case you were wondering, the mayor matched that zero percent showing in the New York suburbs and upstate. And he has achieved a remarkably even level of support pretty much everywhere: Morning Consult\u2019s large, influential tracking poll has him at the same zero percent nationally and in the early states. But this prophet\u2019s lack of honor in his hometown really is special.\n\nSo go ahead and nag de Blasio to get out of the race right now. But be aware: He massively ignored such advice both before and after he announced for the presidency. He\u2019s in it to lose it.", "description": "A new Siena College poll shows New York mayor Bill de Blasio with zero percent in both New York City and New York State, making him the rare candidate with absolutely no electoral base who is somehow still in the Democratic-primary race.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/17/17-bill-de-blasio.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
