It offers \u201cmobile app solutions for the enterprise,\u201d but there is little indication the company\u2019s website has been updated since 2015, when the last entry was posted to its sparsely populated corporate news section. Visitors are invited to contact the company, but the form is broken. The only substantial information on the site comes in the form of a list of patents it offers for license.\n\nOver the last four years, Express Mobile has filed dozens of lawsuits in courts on both U.S. coasts demanding compensation, alleging that some of the internet\u2019s most popular website-building platforms have infringed on those patents. Earlier this year, however, Express found itself on the other end of a lawsuit involving a major software firm.\n\nTalking Point Shopify has asked a Delaware court to declare it isn\u2019t infringing the patents of Express Mobile, a small California firm that has sued dozens of large software companies over its website-building and mobile inventions. The Ottawa-based e-commerce giant has become an increasing target for intellectual property litigation since going public in 2015.\n\nThe Ottawa-based e-commerce giant Shopify is suing the smaller firm, in an attempt to pre-empt a possible action from Express by having a jury declare Shopify is not infringing on patents held by the obscure company with what it calls a \u201clitigious history.\u201d\n\nShopify filed its suit in March in a district court in Delaware, where both Express and Shopify\u2019s U.S. subsidiary are incorporated. The Canadian firm wants a judgment that it has not and is not infringing on four Express patents. Two are for browser-based tools with a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) interface that allow users to create websites, while the others cover ways of displaying content on mobile devices.\n\nShopify went to court after a December 2018 letter from Express\u2019s lawyer accused it of infringing on the four patents \u201cthrough its business of building web sites and web pages for customers.\u201d Shopify\u2019s complaint also claims that Express has \u201cembarked on an industry-wide patent litigation campaign\u201d over the last four years against competitors including BigCommerce.\n\n\u201cIt is a wise strategy to get out ahead of an infringement suit and seek a declaratory judgment under [U.S.] law,\u201d said Myra Tawfik, a professor of intellectual property (IP) commercialization at the University of Windsor\u2019s law faculty. The action suggests Shopify \u201cfeels that it has a strong position on the merits (or at least a strong strategic position) and that it has the financial resources that it is willing to use to take an aggressive stand.\u201d\n\nWhile filing first allowed Shopify to choose the jurisdiction in which it will fight Express, \u201cit\u2019s still a very reactive, entirely defensive play,\u201d said Jim Hinton, a patent lawyer and founder of Own Innovation, a Kitchener, Ont. IP agency. \u201cIt\u2019s not a purely nuisance litigation,\u201d he said, noting that Express\u2019s patents have been tested successfully in previous cases, and the company has shown it\u2019s not afraid to go to court.\n\nShopify has long anticipated that it might be the target of lawsuits. The prospectus for its 2015 initial public offering noted that there are many patents in the software business, and litigation is common. As the company gains \u201cgreater visibility and market exposure, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims,\u201d the prospectus reads.\n\nThat prediction has come to pass. At least five companies have sued Shopify for patent infringement in U.S. district courts since 2016; one of them was dismissed at Shopify\u2019s request, another at the plaintiff\u2019s, but the other three are ongoing.\n\nIn its response to Shopify\u2019s suit, Express claimed the e-commerce firm\u2019s theme editor\u2014which allows online merchants using its platform to modify the layout and sections of their storefronts\u2014infringed on all four patents, while its widget and plug-in authoring tools violated two. In September, Express added a fifth patent to the suit. It\u2019s asking for a judgment that Shopify infringed on all five, and financial damages to compensate it.\n\nShopify denies violating Express\u2019s patents. Neither company responded to multiple requests for comment.\n\n\u201cExpress Mobile [and similar firms] won\u2019t be going after companies until they have a good amount of money to start paying up,\u201d said Hinton, noting that litigation can cost hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, depending on how long it takes. \u201cYou have to have that much money to lose.\u201d\n\nSoftware developer Steven Rempell, who founded Express in 2006, is the sole or co-inventor of all five patents in the Shopify case, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization database. The patents were granted between 2003 and 2018.\n\nSince 2015, Express has launched more than 80 lawsuits in federal courts across four states. Its targets have included major website-building platforms like Weebly\u2014since acquired by Square\u2014and BigCommerce, as well as smaller app-development software firms like AppGyver and digital agencies like Domani Studios.\n\nThe cases rarely make it to trial. Nearly half were dismissed at Express\u2019s request, with the company agreeing not to sue again. Hinton said that suggests the company either chose to abandon the case because it couldn\u2019t prove infringement or decided going forward wasn\u2019t worth it, or \u201cit had its desired effect and came out with a settlement.\u201d Such financial agreements are usually confidential.\n\nShopify hasn\u2019t generated any patents of its own, according to its 2018 annual report. But in September, it announced the US$450-million acquisition of robotics startup 6 River Systems, which has five patents for its warehouse-automation technology.\n\nTawfik said Shopify\u2019s case against Express acts as a statement of intent for would-be pursuers. \u201cIf it didn\u2019t fight back in this way and just settled the claim, it risks becoming an easy target for future trolls,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Hinton said Shopify\u2019s suit won\u2019t \u201cfrighten anybody with a strong case of infringement.\u201d Firms like Express \u201cthat are out to monetize patents are ready to enforce their rights and happy to go to court, because it\u2019s painful for a company [like Shopify] to have to play that game.\u201d\n\nShopify is the second major e-commerce platform to take Express to court before it itself could be sued. In May 2017, Magento asked a California court to declare that it hadn\u2019t infringed on the WYSIWYG patents, and that they were invalid. It said Express had also sued 13 companies that use Magento\u2019s technology to create online shopping sites and strategies for businesses, as well as a \u201cnumber of other providers of website building tools.\u201d\n\nShare the full article!

The case against Express is ongoing, but 12 of those against Magento\u2019s agency partners have been dismissed.\n\nExpress, meanwhile, isn\u2019t slowing down. It\u2019s lodged 18 cases in 2019, including two October filings against publicly traded software companies Wix.com and GoDaddy.com. The Shopify-Express suit is also proceeding in Delaware. Shopify has asked the court to subpoena documents related to Express\u2019s patents; the files were due this week.", "description": "Express Mobile has sued many of the e-commerce giant\u2019s competitors", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Shopify.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
