Mark Meadows said he is surprised by the lengths to which U.S. Attorney John Durham is going to conduct his review of the origins of the Russia investigation.\n\nWith little public knowledge about the monthslong inquiry, the North Carolina congressman said Wednesday the prosecutor of Connecticut is \"doing a lot of work behind the scenes.\"\n\n\"I can tell you, they're reaching people that I thought only I had talked to, and it\u2019s going to be a good day for America and a good day for justice,\" Meadows told Fox Business host Lou Dobbs.\n\nEarlier this year, Attorney General William Barr tasked Durham with leading the review of the Justice Department's and FBI's conduct in the early stages of the Russia investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Barr has also said he is working closely with DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who is wrapping up an investigation into alleged government surveillance abuses.\n\nMeadows, a lead GOP investigator in Congress, said he believes Barr and Horowitz are doing a \"good job\" and hopes for accountability, naming Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson and former FBI officials James Comey, Andrew McCabe, and Peter Strzok.\n\n\"If people do not go to jail, and this is all about just talking and rhetoric and people are not held accountable. The American people will be disillusioned and say 'enough is enough,'\" Meadows said.", "description": "Rep.
