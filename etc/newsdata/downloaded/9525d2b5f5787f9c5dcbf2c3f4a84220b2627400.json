As food decides national prosperity and the people's wellbeing, food security is a major prerequisite for national security. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, China has always prioritized food security in state governance. Despite a weak agricultural foundation and extreme poverty, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has led an unremitting campaign of hard work over the past 70 years that has made China basically self-sufficient in food supply. China now has enough food to feed its nearly 1.4 billion population, and has remarkably improved the people's nutrition and life quality. China's food security is a success of worldwide significance.\n\n\n\n\u515a\u7684\u5341\u516b\u5927\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73\u540c\u5fd7\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u515a\u4e2d\u592e\u628a\u7cae\u98df\u5b89\u5168\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6cbb\u56fd\u7406\u653f\u7684\u5934\u7b49\u5927\u4e8b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u201c\u786e\u4fdd\u8c37\u7269\u57fa\u672c\u81ea\u7ed9\u3001\u53e3\u7cae\u7edd\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u201d\u7684\u65b0\u7cae\u98df\u5b89\u5168\u89c2\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u4ee5\u6211\u4e3a\u4e3b\u3001\u7acb\u8db3\u56fd\u5185\u3001\u786e\u4fdd\u4ea7\u80fd\u3001\u9002\u5ea6\u8fdb\u53e3\u3001\u79d1\u6280\u652f\u6491\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u7cae\u98df\u5b89\u5168\u6218\u7565\uff0c\u8d70\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u4e2d\u56fd\u7279\u8272\u7cae\u98df\u5b89\u5168\u4e4b\u8def\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u575a\u6301\u7acb\u8db3\u56fd\u5185\u4fdd\u969c\u7cae\u98df\u57fa\u672c\u81ea\u7ed9\u7684\u65b9\u9488\uff0c\u5b9e\u884c\u6700\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8015\u5730\u4fdd\u62a4\u5236\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u201c\u85cf\u7cae\u4e8e\u5730\u3001\u85cf\u7cae\u4e8e\u6280\u201d\u6218\u7565\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u63a8\u8fdb\u519c\u4e1a\u4f9b\u7ed9\u4fa7\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6539\u9769\u548c\u4f53\u5236\u673a\u5236\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u7cae\u98df\u751f\u4ea7\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u7cae\u98df\u6d41\u901a\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7cae\u98df\u4f9b\u7ed9\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u65ad\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7cae\u98df\u4ea7\u4e1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7a33\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u66f4\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u7cae\u98df\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u4f53\u7cfb\u9010\u6b65\u5efa\u7acb\uff0c\u56fd\u5bb6\u7cae\u98df\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u66f4\u52a0\u6709\u529b\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u7279\u8272\u7cae\u98df\u5b89\u5168\u4e4b\u8def\u8d8a\u8d70\u8d8a\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u8d8a\u8d70\u8d8a\u5bbd\u5e7f\u3002\n\nSince the CPC's 18th National Congress in 2012, the CPC Central Committee with Xi Jinping as its core has treated food security as a top state issue. The central leadership has introduced a food security policy of \"ensuring basic self-sufficiency of grain and absolute security of staple food\". The Chinese government has established a national strategy on food security featuring self-sufficiency based on domestic grain production, guaranteed food production capacity, moderate imports, and technological support. Abiding by the principle of basic food self-sufficiency based on domestic grain production, China practices the strictest farmland protection system and a strategy of sustainable farmland use and innovative application of agricultural technology to increase farmland productivity. Through supply-side structural reform and institutional innovation in agriculture, China has raised grain productivity, modernized grain circulation, improved food-supply structure, and achieved steady development in the grain industry. Step by step, China has established a food security guarantee system at a very high level characterized by quality, efficiency and sustainability. China's food security has a stronger guarantee, along a steadier and wider path with Chinese characteristics.\n\n\n\n\u7cae\u98df\u5b89\u5168\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u5e73\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u4eba\u7c7b\u547d\u8fd0\u5171\u540c\u4f53\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5173\u7cfb\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c38\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u524d\u9014\u547d\u8fd0\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u5927\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u548c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5927\u56fd\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u59cb\u7ec8\u662f\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e16\u754c\u7cae\u98df\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u529b\u91cf\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u79ef\u6781\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e16\u754c\u7cae\u98df\u5b89\u5168\u6cbb\u7406\uff0c\u52a0\u5f3a\u56fd\u9645\u4ea4\u6d41\u4e0e\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u575a\u5b9a\u7ef4\u62a4\u591a\u8fb9\u8d38\u6613\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u843d\u5b9e\u8054\u5408\u56fd2030\u5e74\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e16\u754c\u7cae\u98df\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5171\u540c\u53d1\u5c55\u4f5c\u51fa\u4e86\u79ef\u6781\u8d21\u732e\u3002\n\nFood security is an essential guarantee for world peace and development, a significant foundation for a global community of shared future, and an influential factor for the development and future of humanity. As the world's largest developing country, and a major country that shoulders its responsibilities, China has always been a positive force in safeguarding world food security. China has been an active part of global food security governance, enhancing international exchanges and cooperation, supporting the multilateral trade system, and implementing the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In this sense, China has made a positive contribution to improving global food security and promoting common development.\n\n\n\n\u4e3a\u5168\u9762\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e2d\u56fd\u7cae\u98df\u5b89\u5168\u6210\u5c31\uff0c\u589e\u8fdb\u56fd\u9645\u793e\u4f1a\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u7cae\u98df\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4e86\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u53d1\u5e03\u672c\u767d\u76ae\u4e66\u3002\n\nThe Chinese government is publishing this white paper to provide a full picture of how food security operates in China, in order to increase the international community's understanding in this important field.\n\n\n\n\u4e00\u3001\u4e2d\u56fd\u7cae\u98df\u5b89\u5168\u6210\u5c31\n\nI.

Data from the National Health Commission shows that the average daily energy intake of a standard person in China is 2,172 kcal, and the intakes of protein, fat and carbohydrate are 65g, 80g and 301g. Chinese citizens have an adequate supply of dietary energy, with sufficient intake of the three major nutrients - proteins, fat and carbohydrates. The proportion of carbohydrate intake has fallen, and those of fat and quality protein intake have risen.\n\n\n\n\uff08\u4e94\uff09\u8d2b\u56f0\u4eba\u53e3\u5403\u996d\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\n\n5.

The Chinese government has always attached great importance to eliminating hunger and poverty. Since the 18th National Congress of the CPC, in particular, it has explored ways to develop the rural economy, increase farmers' incomes, and eliminate hunger and poverty. Remarkable results have been achieved in targeted poverty alleviation and eradication. According to China's current poverty standards, as of the end of 2018 there remained 16.6 million people living in poverty in China. This represented a reduction of 82.39 million compared to 2012, and the incidence of poverty was down from 10.2 percent to 1.7 percent. The government has helped 750 million people out of poverty since 1978, when a staggering 770 million people were struggling for the means to live. According to the World Bank's poverty line of 1.9 US dollars per person per day, China has contributed more than 70 percent of the global poverty reduction effort. China has lifted more people out of poverty than any other country, and is the first country to reach the poverty reduction goal in the UN's Millennium Development Goals.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u91cd\u70b9\u8d2b\u56f0\u7fa4\u4f53\u5065\u5eb7\u8425\u517b\u72b6\u51b5\u660e\u663e\u6539\u5584\u30022018\u5e74\uff0c\u8d2b\u56f0\u5730\u533a\u519c\u6751\u5c45\u6c11\u4eba\u5747\u53ef\u652f\u914d\u6536\u5165\u8fbe10371\u5143\u4eba\u6c11\u5e01\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u589e\u901f\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5168\u56fd\u519c\u67511.7\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002\u6536\u5165\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8d2b\u56f0\u5730\u533a\u7684\u7cae\u98df\u83b7\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8d2b\u56f0\u4eba\u53e3\u7cae\u8c37\u7c7b\u98df\u7269\u6444\u5165\u91cf\u7a33\u5b9a\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u8d2b\u56f0\u5730\u533a\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u5b66\u751f\u8425\u517b\u6539\u5584\u8ba1\u5212\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u5a74\u5e7c\u513f\u8425\u517b\u6539\u5584\u53ca\u8001\u5e74\u8425\u517b\u5065\u5eb7\u8bd5\u70b9\u9879\u76ee\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u513f\u7ae5\u3001\u5b55\u5987\u548c\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u7b49\u91cd\u70b9\u4eba\u7fa4\u8425\u517b\u6c34\u5e73\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u3002\n\n- Nutrition for key groups in poverty has improved markedly. In 2018 the per capita disposable income of residents in impoverished rural areas reached 10,371 yuan, an actual increase of 1.7 percentage points higher than that of rural areas in general. This increase in income has enabled poor areas to acquire more food, and the intake of grains among poor groups has grown steadily. The government has carried out extensive nutrition improvement programs in poor areas for young students, infants, children, pregnant women, and the elderly, as a result of which there have been noticeable improvements in their nutrition and health.", "description": "\u6c11\u4e3a\u56fd\u57fa\uff0c\u8c37\u4e3a\u6c11\u547d\u3002\u7cae\u98df\u4e8b\u5173\u56fd\u8fd0\u6c11\u751f\uff0c\u7cae\u98df\u5b89\u5168\u662f\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/15/5da55f34a310cf3e97a14f23.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
