It claimed them as citizens of its hard-line state, but in reality they were hostages. The way most Syrians and Iraqis experienced the group was as a brutally effective intelligence agency. Neighbors informed on one another; dissent was punished. Even in southern Turkey, where I met the rebel commander in question, Syrians were afraid to discuss the group, wary of retribution. Conversations about ISIS in the region\u2019s hotels and caf\u00e9s were hushed and nervous, as people worried about\u2014even in Turkey, a NATO member state\u2014who might be listening. Just as in Syria and Iraq, ISIS had established underground cells throughout the country.\n\nThe shadowy, lurking aspect of Baghdadi also defined his image internationally. He gave just a single public speech: a sermon in Mosul\u2019s Great Mosque of al-Nuri in July 2014, during which he claimed the restoration of the caliphate, an idea that was an abomination to all but a tiny fraction of the world\u2019s 1.8 billion Muslims. Citizens of Europe, the United States, and other places that were subject to Baghdadi\u2019s terrorist ambitions experienced him less as the self-styled Caliph Ibrahim than as a purveyor of murky, senseless violence.\n\nRead: The kingpin problem\n\nWhere Osama bin Laden focused his efforts on spectacular attacks, Baghdadi stood out for promoting the idea that any sort of violence would do. ISIS carried out horrific mass-casualty attacks: killing more than 100 in Ankara in October 2015 and in Paris the following month, as well as dozens more in Brussels in March 2016, in Istanbul in January 2017, and in Manchester in May 2017. It also carried out an endless series of lower-grade atrocities: stabbing passersby, driving vehicles into crowds. And it encouraged lone wolves, such as the Orlando, Florida, nightclub shooter, to carry out attacks in its name.\n\nThe sum of all this was to promote the idea that anyone could be a threat. It was designed to make people suspicious of their neighbors, or of newly arrived refugees. It pitted people against one another.\n\nThis is worth remembering as Donald Trump takes credit for Baghdadi\u2019s death, because Trump himself helped advance this part of Baghdadi\u2019s cause. As the journalist Murtaza Hussain argued in the wake of the Paris attacks, ISIS was seeking to eliminate what it called the \u201cgray zone\u201d of co-existence between Muslims and the West. \u201cBy launching increasingly shocking attacks against Western targets, the Islamic State is pursuing a specific goal\u2014generating hostility between domestic Muslim populations and the broader societies that they live in,\u201d Hussain wrote. \u201c[It] is consciously seeking to trigger a backlash by Western governments and citizens against the Muslim minorities living in their societies. By achieving this, the group hopes to polarize both sides against each other, locking them into an escalating spiral of alienation, hatred and collective retribution.\u201d", "description": "The instincts and strategy attributed to the ISIS leader illustrate why his terror group is likely to survive his death.", "authors": ["Mike Giglio"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2T55I/facebook.jpg?1572271812", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
