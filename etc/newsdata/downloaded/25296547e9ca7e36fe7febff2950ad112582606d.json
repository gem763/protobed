Photo: Courtesy of STX\n\nLast year at the Toronto International Film Festival, I attended a raucous premiere screening of a film about a diverse group of women achieving self-actualization by stealing from rich, white men. I came away convinced that this socially conscious, expertly crafted thrill ride would be a player in the awards race, but experts I spoke to were unconvinced \u2014 was this movie really the kind of thing the Academy would go for?\n\nThat film was Widows, and I covered that debate in a post called \u201cIs Widows an Oscar Movie?\u201d which just goes to prove the old adage that the answer to every question in a headline is \u201cno.\u201d Steve McQueen\u2019s crime caper was roundly ignored by most awards bodies, and went on to achieve exactly zero Oscar nominations, a major letdown for a director whose previous movie had taken home Best Picture. Now, 12 months later, the same debate is happening again.\n\nOne of my favorite films of this year\u2019s TIFF was Lorene Scafaria\u2019s Hustlers, the real-life story of a gang of New York City strippers who moved from playing with Wall Street guys\u2019 hearts to relieving them of their credit cards. More than one critic at Toronto called the movie \u201cGoodfellas, with sex workers,\u201d and the films do share a similar propulsive energy, as well as a knack for the perfect music cue. As Hustlers is based on a 2015 New York magazine article, I have no choice but to be completely in the tank for it, and were I an Oscar voter, I would choose it in every category, even some that don\u2019t exist yet. (Julia Stiles for Best Performance by an Actor in a Role Based on Journalist Jessica Pressler!)\n\nBut despite film\u2019s strong box office and outstanding reviews, Oscar-watchers are hesitant to put the film on their shortlists just yet. As with Widows, there is the lingering sense that Hustlers might not be \u201can Oscar movie,\u201d a mental distinction that is no less real for being almost impossible to define. (Never forget that Suicide Squad is an Oscar winner.) In the season\u2019s early days, when very few of the year\u2019s contenders have screened, those kind of judgments matter; I\u2019ve heard that over the summer Hustlers wasn\u2019t even an option on GoldDerby\u2019s back end, though that has since changed. Even after the premiere, not everyone is convinced. \u201cIs it an Oscar contender? Don\u2019t believe the hype,\u201d pundit Anne Thompson wrote at Indiewire, adding that the film \u201cis far more likely to play for the Hollywood Foreign Press than the more tony Academy voters, who want their Oscar contenders to shine with the patina of art.\u201d\n\nGetting voters to reconsider the film will come with some challenges. Hustlers is being distributed by STX, a mid-sized studio that, as one critic reminded me, has only one Oscar nomination to its name. (Best Adapted Screenplay for Molly\u2019s Game.) A full-bore awards campaign is an expensive proposition, and compared to its deep-pocketed rivals, STX\u2019s resources are slightly more limited. I\u2019ve also seen the opening of a slight generation gap in how Hustlers has been received. The movie floats, if not outright endorses, the notion that many of the womens\u2019 victims had it coming, an argument that doesn\u2019t seem to be troubling younger viewers versed in an online culture where scamming is an aspirational goal. However, I\u2019ve heard older female festival-goers say they thought the film was \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201coffensive,\u201d complaints that may be echoed in Sherman Oaks come awards time.\n\nRelated: How to Hustle With Cardi B\n\nWhat may ultimately sway voters to sidle up to Hustlers, appropriately enough, is money. Last year, one Oscar strategist pin-pointed to me where Widows went wrong: The film was so afraid of being pegged as \u201cjust a genre movie\u201d that its marketing took great pains to emphasize its serious, socially conscious side. The result was a fairly dour campaign, and when audiences didn\u2019t show up, Widows stumbled. Hustlers, meanwhile, is selling itself as unabashed fun, and after pulling in over $30 million on opening weekend looks like a hit. Now, having already established its box-office bonafides, the film can lean into its political message without seeming like vegetables \u2014 a pivot pulled off just last year by Bohemian Rhapsody.\n\nAnd Hustlers also has something Widows lacked: a truly breakout performance from Jennifer Lopez as the ringleader of the gang of grifters. The part calls for Lopez to use every ounce of her star power \u2014 never more so than in her introduction, a powerhouse pole dance sequence set to Fiona Apple\u2019s \u201cCriminal\u201d \u2014 but she also invests the role with previously unseen layers. \u201cShe\u2019s doing the best work of her career,\u201d our own Angelica Jade Basti\u00e9n writes, \u201cweaponizing an undeniable charisma and turning it into something hard, pointed, righteous, even angry.\u201d\n\nThe film hasn\u2019t yet announced which category Lopez would run in, but outside Laura Dern in Marriage Story, the supporting actress category feels open this year, and a savvy campaign for Lopez would not have to stretch STX\u2019s budget to be effective. But this is a year with few early locks, and Lopez\u2019s path to her first nomination will have some hurdles. The multi-hyphenate star is rumored to be a leading choice to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show, and while getting the gig would keep her name percolating (crucial for a September release), it would also pull her away from the trail during the shortened season\u2019s home stretch. And as Kyle Buchanan notes in the Times, Lopez\u2019s star image might be a hard sell for voters who prefer their Oscar first-timers to bring a touch of humility to the circuit: \u201cIf a crucial part of Lopez\u2019s mystique is how she flaunts her hard-won success, academy members may sniff that she\u2019s not doing much acting in Hustlers.\u201d\n\nStill, her character\u2019s closing argument \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s all a strip club: You have people tossing the money, and people doing the dance\u201d \u2014 may ring true to voters accustomed to pleasing their own paymasters, and the actress has cannily appropriated the line for herself on the Hustlers promo circuit. If enough viewers dig the message, Lopez remains the movie\u2019s best chance at hearing its name read from a very different kind of stage next year. It\u2019s just a shame many of her best scenes will never make a TV-broadcast clip package.", "description": "\u201cHustlers\u201d has been receiving rave reviews, and was a surprise box-office hit.
