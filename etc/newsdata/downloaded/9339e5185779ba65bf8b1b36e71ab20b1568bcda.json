Within the country\u2019s overlooked hinterland, conditions are desperate, with unemployment in some areas thought to be as high as 30 per cent.\n\nDespite a much vaunted war on corruption, spearheaded by presidential candidate and current prime minister Youssef Chahed, the perception across much of the country is one of an entrenched elite getting richer, while many are left to languish in poverty.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The result was television on a scale rarely seen in Tunisia\u2019s modern history, with 11 of the country\u2019s television channels carrying the debate, alongside 20 radio stations.\n\nFrom an initial field of almost 100, including the Middle East\u2019s first openly gay candidate, the field has been whittled down to 26, all of whom now vie for the position of head of state.\n\nAppearing alongside relative outsiders, such as idiosyncratic law professor Kais Saied and Abir Moussi, an avowed apologist for Tunisia\u2019s pre-revolutionary regime, were establishment stalwarts, Chahed, defence minister Abdelkarim Zbidi and the first presidential candidate to be fielded by moderate Islamists Ennahda, Abdelfattah Mourou.\n\nIn cafes around the capital, crowds spilled out onto the street as Tunisians gathered to watch their potential leaders trade in soundbites for the chance to proceed to the second round of voting, the date for which has yet to be announced.\n\nNevertheless, despite Karoui\u2019s absence, rumours of private polls conducted by various international agencies suggest the momentum of his insurgent campaign may not have been dented by his absence. Across the country, the same anger that sparked the country\u2019s 2011 revolution continues to fester and continues to fuel Nabil Karoui\u2019s populist campaign.\n\nKaroui has remained in detention since his arrest on 23 August, and he lost the second of two appeals for conditional release on Friday.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In the febrile atmosphere of the presidential campaign, much of the substance of the charges against Karoui and his brother, which were initially brought by anti-corruption watchdog, IWatch, in 2016, are often overlooked\n\nIn the build-up to the campaigning period, his television station Nessma TV made great play of images of Karoui distributing aid via his charitable association, Khalil Tounes, to the overlooked interior regions while railing against the shortcomings of Chahed and his government.\n\n\u201cPopulists and outsiders benefit from the general discontent about the bad economic conditions,\u201d Tunisian political analyst Youssef Cherif tells The Independent.\n\n\u201cThey promise to change things and they point to the fact/claim that they have nothing to do with the current conditions, that they\u2019ll do better. So people, in search of hope, believe them and fall for their rhetoric.\u201d\n\nAlways perceived as something of a maverick, Riahi has yet to greatly trouble Tunisia\u2019s political conscience.\n\nHe fled the country in November after he accused of Chahed and his immediate circle of plotting a coup d\u2019etat. The charges were swiftly dismissed by the military court Riahi had lodged them with.\n\nPopulists and outsiders benefit from the general discontent about the bad economic conditions Youssef Cherif, political analyst\n\nHowever, the accusation reinforced the perception among parts of Tunisia\u2019s political class who sought to portray the prime minister as a tyrant, a perception Karoui\u2019s team made much play of during his campaign, significantly ratcheting up their denunciations of official complicity in the businessman\u2019s arrest on 23 August.\n\nInstead, Karoui\u2019s supporters cast them, and the delay in bringing them to court, as further evidence of an orchestrated campaign to silence their \u201cNelson Mandela of Tunisia\u201d.\n\nTheir claims are not entirely without substance.\n\nIn May, the outspoken television mogul had his channel taken off air after armed police raided his offices in central Tunis alleging breaches of broadcasting guidelines.\n\nIn July, shortly after Karoui established his lead in the last of the official polls, the government passed an electoral amendment that would have essentially precluded him and a small number of rival candidates from running for president, legislation that former President Essebsi declined to either sign into law or return to parliament before his death.\n\nIrrespective of the claims of either camp, after years of marginalisation many within Tunisia are choosing to see the coming contest as one between the establishment class that has consistently overlooked them, and a fresh tranche of anti-system politicians that, like so many around the world, promise to rewrite the rulebook in their favour.", "description": "Drama continues to define the build-up to Tunisia\u2019s presidential elections on Sunday, with the polls\u2019 populist frontrunner and media mogul\u00a0Nabil Karoui currently on hunger strike in prison, where he languishes\u00a0on charges of tax evasion and money laundering, while another candidate, Slim Riahi, previously the general secretary of the country\u2019s former ruling party, skulks in", "authors": ["Simon Speakman Cordall"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/18/tunisia-election.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
