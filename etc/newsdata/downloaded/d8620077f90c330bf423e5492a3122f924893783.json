Osuna was acquired by the Astros in 2018 while serving a 75-game suspension under Major League Baseball\u2019s domestic violence policy.\n\nAD\n\nTaubman reportedly turned to the reporters, one of whom was reportedly wearing a purple domestic violence awareness bracelet, and repeatedly yelled: \u201cThank God we got Osuna! I\u2019m so f------ glad we got Osuna!\u201d The reliever had blown a save opportunity in the ninth inning of the decisive game against the New York Yankees before Houston\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Altuve hit a two-run home run in the bottom of the frame to set up a World Series matchup with the Washington Nationals.\n\nAD\n\nSports Illustrated reported that Taubman\u2019s outburst \u201cwas offensive and frightening enough that another Houston staffer apologized.\u201d\n\nThough the report was later confirmed by multiple other reporters who were in the clubhouse, the Astros issued a statement Monday night describing the Sports Illustrated story as \u201cmisleading and completely irresponsible.\u201d The Astros said a Houston player was \u201cbeing asked questions about a difficult outing,\u201d and their \u201cexecutive was supporting the player during a difficult time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHis comments had everything to do with the game situation that just occurred and nothing else \u2014 they were also not directed toward any specific reporters,\u201d the Astros said in the statement. \u201cWe are extremely disappointed in Sports Illustrated\u2019s attempt to fabricate a story where one does not exist.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAfter the Astros released their statement, the Houston Chronicle reported that two of its reporters were able to confirm the claims made by Sports Illustrated. A reporter for Yahoo Sports also said she could provide confirmation.\n\nThe Chronicle cited two eyewitnesses in reporting that Taubman was \u201cholding a cigar and standing with two or three other men when he yelled his comments,\u201d and that the group of female reporters was \u201capproximately eight feet away and one was visibly shaken by the comment.\u201d The Chronicle also reported there were no players in the area and no interviews were being conducted at the time, disputing the team\u2019s claim.\n\nAD\n\nThe Astros called this @stephapstein report misleading. It is not. I was there. Saw it. And I should\u2019ve said something sooner.\n\n\n\nhttps://t.co/aE4WEgUJox \u2014 Hunter Atkins (@HunterAtkins35) October 22, 2019\n\nThree eyewitnesses \u2014\n\nincluding two Chronicle reporters \u2014 confirm @stephapstein's reporting of Brandon Taubman's conduct in the Astros' ALCS clinching clubhouse - https://t.co/ukRn8TQcFY \u2014 Chandler Rome (@Chandler_Rome) October 22, 2019\n\nOsuna, 24, was traded to the Astros from the Toronto Blue Jays in July 2018, as he was nearing the end of a suspension levied in May of that year. Houston was viewed at the time as having filled a need for a closer by acquiring the talented pitcher, a 2017 all-star, at a relative discount because of his notoriety.\n\nAD\n\nOsuna was charged in May 2018 with assault in a case allegedly involving the mother of his young child. Prosecutors eventually dropped the charge when she communicated to them that she would not travel from Mexico to Canada to testify against him. The case ended with Osuna signing a peace bond, with no admission of guilt, plus an agreement by him to stay away from the woman and continue counseling.\n\n\u201cThe Astros remain committed to increase our support regarding the issues of domestic violence and abuse of any kind,\u201d the team said in a statement at the time.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "The report accused assistant general manager Brandon Taubman of deliberately yelling supportive comments about reliever Roberto Osuna to a group of female reporters.
