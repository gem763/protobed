That\u2019s compared with the Treasury\u2019s 4.5% February estimate and would be the biggest gap since 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nPower shortages and policy uncertainty have damped economic growth and plunged business confidence to multi-decade lows, while the revenue service has struggled to meet tax estimates. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni reiterated in July that the bailouts will come at a cost to taxpayers, who have faced a series of tax hikes since 2015, including the first increase in VAT since 1993.\n\n\u201cWe cannot rely on fiscal policy to stimulate the economy,\u201d Lullu Krugel, the chief economist at PwC, said by phone from Johannesburg. \u201cIf we see a global economic downturn, we don\u2019t have any buffer against it. There\u2019s no chance of spending ourselves out of it like we did in 2008 and 2009.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s R128bn three-year package for power producer Eskom - the utility that\u2019s seen as the biggest risk to the economy -- will add to state liabilities and widen the deficit, Moody\u2019s Investors Service said last month. It\u2019s the only major ratings company that still assesses the country\u2019s debt at investment grade.\n\nJunk risk\n\nAnalysts are speculating that Moody\u2019s may cut the stable outlook on the Baa3 rating to negative because of rising debt and lower economic-growth projections, putting the country on the verge of another junk rating.\n\nA downgrade would leave South Africa without an investment-grade ranking for the first time in 25 years, and see the nation fall out of key debt gauges including the FTSE World Government Bond Index, prompting capital outflows.\n\nMboweni\u2019s policy statement needs to \u201csend a signal to rating agencies that the state remains committed to fiscal consolidation,\u201d said Jeffrey Schultz, a senior economist at BNP Paribas South Africa. The economy needs non-interest spending cuts of more than 2% of GDP to stabilize debt metrics \u201ctoday\u201d although a 0.5% reduction within a solid macroeconomic plan would make for a credible budget, he said.\n\n\n\nWeak growth\n\nThe National Treasury has asked government departments to propose how to reduce expenditure in a way that has the least impact on service delivery. It sought cuts of 5% for 2020-21, and 6% and 7% for the next two years. That could be as much as 300 billion rand over three years.\n\nFailure to narrow the budget gap could raise debt, including guarantees to Eskom, to more than 70% of gross domestic product in the medium term, said Moody\u2019s. Fitch Ratings Ltd. sees state debt increasing to 68% of GDP by 2021-22 from about 56% now, it said in July.\n\nWeak economic growth remains a major constraint to the fiscal outlook. A Bloomberg survey of 28 economists sees GDP expanding 0.6% this year, in line with the central bank\u2019s forecasts. That would be the lowest annual rate since 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNext year, if the global economy doesn\u2019t hit the brakes too severely, we could get up to 1.5% or thereabout - but the bottom line is if we keep on in this region of 1%-1.5%, it\u2019s not enough, it\u2019s not going to work,\u201d PwC\u2019s Krugel said. \u201cWe need some serious structural changes.\u201d", "description": "Billions in bailouts for South Africa\u2019s power utility will probably widen the budget deficit to the biggest since the financial crisis, threatening the nation\u2019s remaining investment-grade credit rating.", "authors": ["Minutes Ago - Prinesha Naidoo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7335/730bc18143ba4ea296af6541d3f05edd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
