We are aligned on strategy and direction.\"\n\nSmith said in a memo to employees he was actively involved in the succession planning process.\n\n\"To be clear, I'm not planning to go anywhere soon,\" Smith said. \"Please know that when the time comes to hand over the reins, you will hear it from me.\"\n\nThe Financial Times cited four unnamed sources as saying Thomson Reuters, which owns the Reuters news agency, had hired search firm Spencer Stuart to put together a list of internal and external candidates. The search was at an early stage, the newspaper said.\n\nIn a statement, Thomson Reuters said: \"The Board of Directors considers succession planning and benchmarking for all key executives a matter of good governance. Hence, the Board and management continuously assess internal candidates and work with search firms to scan the external market.\"\n\nSpencer Stuart declined to comment and a spokesman for Thomson Reuters declined to comment specifically on whether it had engaged Spencer Stuart.\n\nSmith oversaw the sale of a majority stake in the news and information provider's financial-data business to a Blackstone Group Inc-led (N: ) consortium last year. Earlier this year, Blackstone agreed to sell the financial-data business, now called Refinitiv, to London Stock Exchange Group (L: ) for $27 billion.", "description": "Thomson Reuters says engaged in CEO succession planning", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9J0R0-OCABS_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
