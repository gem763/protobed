A subsequent Dutch-led probe into the tragedy has been heavily criticized, particularly because Ukraine, a suspect in the incident, was part of the international investigative team.\n\nThe Dutch-led investigators listed three Russians and a Ukrainian as suspects in the incident, but their findings have been criticized by the Malaysian government.\n\nAlso on rt.com MH17 probe didn\u2019t look for causes of tragedy, opted to impulsively blame Russia \u2013 Malaysian PM\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t really looking at the causes of the crash and who was responsible, but already they have decided that it must be Russia. We can\u2019t accept that kind of attitude,\u201d Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said in an interview in July.\n\nRussia has maintained that it had nothing to do with the aircraft\u2019s downing. It supplied radar data and evidence from experiments to the Dutch-led experts proving that the missile that destroyed the Malaysian plane belonged to the Ukrainian military, but this data has been brushed aside.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
