REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nOnce the \u201cpolitical craziness\u201d in Britain has played itself out, Europe\u2019s largest low-cost carrier does not expect an impact on its business, O\u2019Leary said at a Reuters Newsmaker event in London.\n\n\u201cIf you look out long enough, I don\u2019t think Brexit has any effect on our business,\u201d O\u2019Leary said, on the basis that ultimately Britain would have no choice but to make a trade deal and retain the Open Skies aviation agreement with the EU.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nuts to leave (the EU), but if you are going to leave, the first thing you\u2019ve got to do on the day after you leave is renegotiate a trade deal with the European Union.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Leary campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU in the June 2016 referendum and was one of the most vocal airline executives highlighting the risks of Brexit to the sector.\n\nSince then, Britain and the European Union have agreed a deal to allow flights to continue in the short-term and O\u2019Leary has come to the conclusion that the damage of a British no-deal exit would be too severe.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody who would want to be the UK Prime Minister who leads the UK out on a no-deal scenario. There will be food shortages, there will be medicine shortages,\u201d he said, adding that ports would also be disrupted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to fall apart at Dover and Calais. And I can\u2019t imagine that even (Boris) Johnson would want to be the Prime Minister who visited that on the UK.\u201d\n\nBut long-term optimism does not diminish the threat of uncertainty in the coming weeks, he said.\n\n\u201cAm I confident of anything in the next 5-10 weeks? No. I have no idea what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said, adding that the government would ultimately be forced to return to a deal along the lines of that brokered by former British Prime Theresa May but rejected in parliament.\n\nO\u2019Leary, who lives around 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the Northern Ireland border said any introduction of border infrastructure could lead to violence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how you can go back to checks... anywhere, on the border, 5 miles away from the border, that won\u2019t ultimately become a target for a tiny minority of misguided individuals,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe should be very careful,\u201d he added.", "description": "Britain has no choice but to agree an orderly exit from the European Union because the disruption of a hard Brexit would be too damaging to the British economy and to peace in Ireland, Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Conor Humphries", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435847149&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902C7", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
