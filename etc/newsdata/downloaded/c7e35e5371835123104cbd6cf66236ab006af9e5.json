These are cosmetic surgery patients who document their desires and results on Instagram, but only for other patients or prospective clients, most of them say. They use names and hashtags that connect the work to their provider. So, for example, KathySmithDoll would be a woman who underwent surgery with a Dr Kathy Smith.\n\nIn an era of patient empowerment, these pages \u2013 they\u2019re called \u201cSx pages,\u201d with \u201cSx\u201d mimicking the prescriptive \u201cRx\u201d \u2013 form a just-out-of-sight Instagram community. They serve as a cosmetic surgery shopping guide, a best-practices education system, and can also sound the alarm about bad experiences with practitioners. Some pre-surgery doll pages are more like inspiration pages or mood boards, collecting images of desired shapes.\n\n\u201cOther girls doing research can find someone with a similar build to theirs and follow their journey for a glimpse at what they might look like if they got similar procedures,\u201d explains Tai Hall, a massage therapist in Maryland. On her Instagram, she showcases before-and-after body-contouring results; in her Facebook group she teaches postoperative self-massage and how people can best take care of themselves while healing.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThese Instagram pages \u201care really big deals\u201d, she says. The Sx Instagram pages are private and anonymous, to some extent, and follow strict rules to stay that way, particularly since many feature nudity (as a social media practice, Sx pages are fairly similar to teenagers\u2019 private \u201cfinsta\u201d friends-only accounts. They are, similarly, unverified and what they report is unverifiable). Many of the bios on these pages indicate they won\u2019t allow access to men.\n\nEach Instagram page bio often unveils elaborate details, often including height and weight. The patient \u2013 the doll \u2013 will list surgery dates and tag her surgeon, recovery house, any post-op care specialists or private nurses, and her post-op massage therapist. Recovery houses, surgery providers and massage therapists also use the hashtags to promote their services. Some of these are flooded with ads or spam. Some are used by practitioners for education about surgery.\n\nThe surgery age\n\nAccording to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, more than 1.8 million cosmetic surgeries were performed in the United States in 2018. Breast augmentation and liposuction accounted for about a third of those.\n\n1.8m Cosmetic surgeries performed in the US in 2018\n\nAnd the number of \u201ccosmetic minimally invasive procedures\u201d \u2014 Botox, laser hair removal, soft tissue fillers and more \u2014 has grown rapidly in the United States. There were fewer than five million procedures in 2000. In 2018, there were nearly 16 million. Almost half of those procedures were Botox treatments.\n\nCosmetic procedures are also becoming more popular among people of colour. The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery reports that cosmetic augmentation, like liposuctions and buttocks lifts, increased 56 per cent among African-Americans from 2005 to 2013, and is still rising.\n\nAs the number of savvy customers grows, doll pages provide a useful glimpse into the less glamorous side of before and after \u2014 the details that people like to overlook, like bruising, drainage and the often painfully long process of healing after significant surgeries.\n\nPatients become online advertisements for their surgeons. Surgeons develop a reputation on social media for being the best at certain procedures, for delivering a desired look, or for working with certain ethnic groups and body types.\u201cThey\u2019ll cry and upload videos of pain and success and their struggles, or whatever they\u2019re going through, and their surgery sisters help uplift them,\u201d says Hall.\n\nAnd there is a lot to talk about, from surgeons to procedures to recovery houses to advice on how to travel with the least hassle from airport security or airline staff when patients are clad in fajas (a kind of post-op girdle) or other foam paddings.\n\nHow we shop for surgeons now\n\n\u201cSx pages can be an effective patient empowerment tool if done honestly and fairly,\u201d says Dr Alan Matarasso, a plastic surgeon in New York and the president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. \u201cIt makes sense, because this is a small group of people,\u201d he adds. \u201cNot a lot of doctors do Brazilian butt lifts, but patients need to realise that they are not rating a restaurant.\u201d\n\nPatients need to realise that they are not rating a restaurant Dr Alan Matarasso\n\nMatarasso encourages prospective patients who rely on Sx pages to research and prepare in other ways as well. \u201cThe standards have to be even greater than if you had a sick gallbladder, because you don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is not like vetting a hotel room. You have to be careful.\u201d\n\nMatarasso recommends that prospective patients ask to see the surgeon\u2019s best results and worst results, or a random case \u2013 say, the 37th case they did that year. He suggests that prospective clients visit the American Board of Plastic Surgery websites to do research and that patients query the licensing state and find out what, if any, violations a surgeon may have had. Patients can ask board-certified surgeons their speciality and whether they are certified in it.\n\nHall, the massage therapist, warned that patients may see women who heal faster or achieve different results than they might. As is often the case on Instagram, people tend to post fewer of their struggles and more of their highlight reels.\n\nPatients taking care of patients\n\nSx pages may be even more valuable for patients who plan to travel internationally for their surgery. Many people in the United States do this to save money. Doll pages serve to warn prospective patients about problems that surgeons and hospitals don\u2019t disclose.\n\nAfter surgery, especially if extensive travel is needed, patients may recuperate at recovery houses for a few days. Procedures like fat transfer to the buttocks leave patients unable to move around or sit; doctors may install drains to help remove fluid after surgery. In a recovery house, a caretaker can tend to their incisions, help with bathing, food, pain medications and even perform regular post-op massages.\n\nIn May, the mother of an Instagram model named Yatnaa Rivera died during a procedure in the Dominican Republic. Rivera took to Instagram to ask for help and to warn others. The doctor who performed the operation, Hector Cabral, had been fined for operating in the United States without a license. He is linked to several deaths and is still practising (Cabral did not respond to enquiries via social media; his office answered calls but said he was on vacation). Instagram accounts used his doll hashtag (#CabralDoll) to spread the message.\n\nEvery day women are bombarded with images of beauty. With filters and editing apps, and the army of social media influencers who receive money or free cosmetic services in exchange for their Instagram posts, it\u2019s often hard to know what\u2019s real. Authentic depictions of what cosmetic surgery entails can be a reality check on what is attainable with cosmetic surgery.\n\nIn May, the American College of Surgeons released voluntary ethical guidelines for social media by surgeons. Many of them address patient privacy, but they also advise practitioners to provide trustworthy medical advice and to be cautious around these \u201cpowerful educational tools\u201d. Even so, now a real-time, crowdsourced system allows patients to cut through.\n\nThis article was produced in collaboration with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
