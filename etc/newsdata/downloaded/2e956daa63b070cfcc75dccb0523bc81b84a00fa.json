Hoping for the same luck with Week 8! USA TODAY\n\nA quick rundown on items of interest as Week 8 rolls on in the NFL:\n\nWho\u2019s hot: Christian McCaffrey. Something has to give at Levi\u2019s Stadium on Sunday. The 49ers (6-0) haven\u2019t lost all season, and neither has Carolina Panthers quarterback Kyle Allen (4-0) since filling in for the injured Cam Newton. Allen\u2019s been a great storyline in this season of alternative QB success. He hasn\u2019t thrown a pick, and his 106.6 passer rating is fourth-best in the NFL. Still, McCaffrey, the multi-dimensional running back, looms as the biggest barometer for what goes down in Santa Clara as the former Stanford star returns to the Bay Area.\n\nMcCaffrey, who ranks second in the NFL with 923 yards from scrimmage and is tied for the league lead with nine TDs, is the engine who drives Norv Turner\u2019s offense. He proved right away as a rookie in 2017 that he was sturdy enough to endure as an every-down back and run between the tackles, dismissing pre-draft rumblings to the contrary. And he\u2019s having his best season yet, critically for Carolina (4-2) as it survives without the bread-and-butter component that Newton possessed.\n\nNow comes maybe the biggest test of his young career: The emerging 49ers defense has turned in three consecutive games without allowing 200 yards of offense, which is like Steel Curtain stuff. If McCaffrey can produce as he has against that backdrop, the Panthers \u2013 and Allen \u2013 just might pull off the shocker of the week.\n\nCarolina Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey returns to his native Bay Area on Sunday.

The woes that the Philadelphia Eagles take to Buffalo extend beyond the quarterback, who has yet to recapture the MVP-like groove he was on two years ago before blowing out his knee. Wentz hasn\u2019t been the one with the drops and fumbles that his receivers have committed at an alarming rate. He doesn\u2019t cover in the leaky secondary. Can\u2019t shore up the linebacking crew. And he wasn\u2019t the coach (Doug Pederson) guaranteeing a win at Dallas that turned out to be an embarrassing loss.\n\nBut there are whispers about his game and leadership (\u201cWhere there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire,\u201d just-released cornerback Orlando Scandrick insisted on FS1). This is what happens when you\u2019re the face of the franchise, getting $128 million on the four-year extension. The shots keep coming, fair or not. And the Eagles\u2019 8-10 record with Wentz since he returned is attached to the quarterback, like always, for better or for worse because they are best positioned to make a difference. The Eagles\u2019 crisis \u2013 best reflected by back-to-back blowout road losses \u2013 presents an opportune time for Wentz to inject hope with some game-changing brilliance. If he can.\n\nKey Matchup: Jarvis Landry (and Baker, OBJ, et al) vs. Patriots defense. Landry and his running mate, Odell Beckham Jr., formulate the best, most explosive set of bookend receivers that New England\u2019s top-ranked defense and ball-hawking secondary has seen all season. By far. A test! The Patriots D, allowing a league-low 6.9 points per game, has proceeded on this historic trek (to this point) against one awful offense after another. The Jets rank 32nd, and they played them twice, in addition to Miami (31st), Washington (29th), Pittsburgh (28th) and the Giants (24th). Buffalo (17th) marks the best offense New England has faced. Buffalo?\n\nThe Bills (5-1) are the only Patriots victim this season with a winning record. Maybe that\u2019s why Landry was moved to utter, then walk back, what sounded like a victory guarantee for his talented squad. No matter -- the Browns head to Foxborough with Baker Mayfield leading the NFL with 11 INTs. On paper, that\u2019s a bad matchup against a unit that has collected an NFL-high 18 picks and made Sam Darnold see ghosts. This could be a four-pick game.\n\nNext man up: Matt Moore. As reigning MVP Patrick Mahomes rehabs a knee injury, the Kansas City Chiefs head into a showdown against the red-hot Green Bay Packers with a quarterback who wasn\u2019t even in the NFL last season. Moore, 35, who was helping coach at his old high school in California after his seven years in Miami, will make his first start in nearly two years. That\u2019s a tall order with Aaron Rodgers on the other side.\n\nBut at least Moore has Andy Reid, and the Chiefs\u2019 coach has an impressive track record for improvising with fill-in quarterbacks. See Jeff Garcia, A.J. Feeley, Koy Detmer and Nick Foles. All had winning records as emergency sub QBs under Reid, who is extremely adept at tailoring game plans around the capabilities of the passers at hand. Still, the Chiefs\u2019 magic with Mahomes included downfield strikes that brought to life the speed of KC\u2019s skill players (including Tyreek Hill). And even if the offense clicks with Moore, Reid & Co. will still need to tailor something to slow down A-Rod to avoid a third consecutive loss at Arrowhead.\n\nRookie watch: Ty Johnson. With workhorse back Kerryon Johnson on IR after undergoing left knee surgery this week, the Detroit Lions turn to another Johnson to pick up the slack. This illustrates how quickly stock can change in the NFL. The Maryland product wasn\u2019t even invited to the NFL combine last winter and joined Detroit as a sixth-round pick. Here\u2019s what he could provide as the Giants visit Ford Field: Explosiveness. That was Johnson\u2019s calling card in the Terps\u2019 backfield, and the potential was confirmed during his pro day workout last spring when he clocked a 40-yard dash time of 4.26 seconds \u2013 better than not only any running back, but a better time than any player overall at the combine.\n\nThe workload shouldn\u2019t be overwhelming for the rookie. Detroit\u2019s offense, built around Matthew Stafford\u2019s arm, ranks 19th in the league for rushing attempts. And J.D. McKissic is the go-to back on passing downs. But there\u2019s always a need for the ability to move the chains with the run in a pinch, and any offense will take the big chunk plays when they can get them.\n\nStomach for an upset: Raiders at Texans. It has been six weeks since the Raiders played a game on their home (and next year former) turf at the Coliseum, but they head into their fifth consecutive game away from Oakland remaining relevant (3-3) to the playoff picture. At the moment, Houston (4-3) holds the final AFC playoff slot. The Raiders can flip that on Sunday. It will take shaking off their worst outing of the season in the blowout last weekend at Green Bay. It\u2019s possible.\n\nIt\u2019s the NFL, where the team you saw last week isn\u2019t necessarily the one you\u2019ll see this week. Remember, in addition to beating the Bears in London, Jon Gruden\u2019s team stung the Colts at Indy. The same Colts who punished the Texans last week. The same Texans who took it to the Chiefs at Arrowhead (as did Indy). Yeah, those Chiefs, who hammered the Raiders when the NFL nomads were last seen before the Black Hole crowd. What gives? The Texans are 6 \u00bd-point favorites, way too big of a margin to trust.\n\nIf the playoffs were today\u2026 Matt LaFleur would be in the mix for NFL Coach of the Year honors. This will be sorted out during the second half of the season, with veterans Bill Belichick, Sean Payton, John Harbaugh and Mike Zimmer also on the radar for the award. And Frank Reich is not to be overlooked. In Belichick\u2019s case, it\u2019s the hand\u2019s on-work with the NFL\u2019s best* defense.\n\nFor Reich, it\u2019s guiding a team that didn\u2019t flinch after Andrew Luck\u2019s surprise retirement. Harbaugh has progressed with the Lamar Jackson plan contrary to conventional NFL wisdom. Zimmer\u2019s vision of offense has come to life, aided by his enlistment of consultant (and run guru) Gary Kubiak. And Payton, my top choice at the moment, has won through the disaster of Drew Brees\u2019 broken thumb, resurrecting Teddy Bridgewater in the process.\n\nYet LaFleur is certainly due some love in his first season. People wondered whether he\u2019d coexist with Aaron Rodgers. Well, the Packers (6-1) are now the team to beat in the A-North. Rodgers has been Rodgers. Spectacular. And with a better defense that conceivably could travel if need be in January, Green Bay looms as a tough out, regardless of how it is seeded. The other rookie coach in this lineup is Kliff Kingsbury. He doesn\u2019t have A-Rod, but he has helped his rookie QB, Kyler Murray, proceed quickly along the learning curve. And the undefeated Kyle Shanahan \u2013 knock on wood that Jimmy Garoppolo stays healthy -- lurks as another possibility.", "description": "Christian McCaffrey is the engine who drives Panthers' offense.
