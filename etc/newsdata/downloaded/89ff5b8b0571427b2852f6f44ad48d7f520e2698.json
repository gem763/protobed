Saban's holdings have slid in value to 753 million shekels ($214 million).\n\nThe Calcalist daily said Saban had lost $175 million on his investment in Partner and would return the shares by the end of the year. It noted that Saban had used his holdings in Partner, whose market value stands at 2.5 billion shekels, as collateral for the loan.\n\nHutchison founded Partner in the late 1990s and sold its stake to Scailex in 2009 before Scailex sold it to Saban.\n\nLike its peers, Partner's (O: ) revenue and profit have plunged in the wake of a 2012 reform that opened the mobile market to new players, sharply reducing prices. It is seeking new revenue streams and pushing to become an integrated multi-service telecoms group.", "description": "Saban to return controlling stake in Israel's Partner Comms: media", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8L09U_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
