It's now $21.3 trillion. That's up 25 times,\" he said. \"All you had to do was believe that this country was going to survive and invest then and you would have made 25 times your money.\"\n\n\"I'm thinking the next 50 years is going to be similar to the last 50 years. That would be 25 times your money if you invest now,\" he said, adding that currently \"extraordinarily\" low interest rates provide even more incentive to invest.\n\n\"Technology is making businesses grow faster,\" compared with the traditional, capital intensive ways of building physical structures in hopes they will pay off over time, Baron said. \"It's making the costs be lower.\"\n\nThe founder of Baron Capital, with $29.6 billion in assets under management, also said, \"Knowledge is growing at the fastest pace it's ever grown.\"\n\nNearly a year ago, Baron had predicted the Dow would reach 500,000 in a half-century.", "description": "The buy-and-hold billionaire says \"fear is evident\" in the stock market, but that should not deter people from investing in stocks.", "authors": ["Matthew J.
