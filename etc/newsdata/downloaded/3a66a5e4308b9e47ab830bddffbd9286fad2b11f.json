Add Interest\n\n\"We are looking at vaping strongly, it's very dangerous, children have died and people have died,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"We're going to have some very strong rules and regulations.\"\n\nThe president said kids are coming home from school and saying, \"Mom, I want to vape.\"\n\nRichard Vogel/AP, FILE\n\nTrump was meeting Wednesday with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Food and Drug Administrator Ned Sharpless who joined him and the first lady in the Oval Office, to discuss the proposed regulation, which they said might not be finalized for several weeks.\n\nThe FDA said the move would mean \"clearing the market of unauthorized, non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products.\"\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nEarlier this week, Melania Trump tweeted about vaping, saying she is \"deeply concerned about the growing epidemic.\"\n\n\"That's how the first lady got involved,\" Trump said. \"She's got a son ... together, that's beautiful young man and she feels very strongly about it.\"\n\nI am deeply concerned about the growing epidemic of e-cigarette use in our children. We need to do all we can to protect the public from tobacco-related disease and death, and prevent e-cigarettes from becoming an on-ramp to nicotine addiction for a generation of youth. @HHSGov \u2014 Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) September 9, 2019\n\nThe FDA is in charge of regulating e-cigarettes, which have recently gained in popularity. The CDC has advised against people using e-cigarettes, also known as vaping pens. Azar said that the FDA plans to finalize a guidance document to start enforcing flavors other than tobacco to be removed from the market, as children are particularly attracted to those flavors.\n\n\"Vaping is becoming a big business as I understand it, like a giant business in a short period of time. We can't allow people to get sick and we can't have our youth be so effected,\" Trump said.\n\n\"A lot of people think vaping is wonderful and it is great. It is not wonderful. That's one thing I think we can say, definitely.\"\n\nIt's unclear how much teeth this announcement would actually have. The FDA has issued warnings already about using flavors to target young people and companies have said they made changes to address the FDA's concerns.\n\nCraig Mitchelldyer/AP, File\n\nThe proposed FDA move drew sharp criticism from the head of the American Vaping Association, a a non-profit that advocates for sensible regulation of vaping products but is not a trade organization or industry spokesperson.\n\n\"We are deeply disappointed in the President\u2019s decision to take direction from anti-vaping activists like Mike Bloomberg by attempting to ban the sale of nearly every vaping product on the market. A ban will remove life-changing options from the market that have been used by several million American adults to quit smoking,\" said Gregory Conley, the AVA president. \"In the history of the United States, prohibition has never worked. It didn\u2019t work with alcohol. It hasn\u2019t worked with marijuana. It won\u2019t work with e-cigarettes.\"\n\nA spokesperson for industry leader JUUL Labs said in a statement to ABC News: \"We strongly agree with the need for aggressive category-wide action on flavored products. We will fully comply with the final FDA policy when effective.\"\n\nABC News' Stephanie Ebbs contributed to this report.", "description": "The Trump administration says it will move to ban flavored e-cigarette products amid a spate of deaths across the country.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/trump-vaping-white-house-01-ap-jc-190911_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
