Picture taken February 14, 2019.\n\nLONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Sony\u2019s \u201cBe Moved\u201d slogan does not apply when an activist investor is applying pressure. The Japanese entertainment conglomerate on Tuesday rejected a proposal from Dan Loeb\u2019s Third Point to spin off its chips business and offload its financial unit. Its defence is only partly convincing.\n\nThe pushy hedge fund firm\u2019s second run at Sony emerged in early April. Its letter in June \u2013 some six years after it last confronted the company, unsuccessfully \u2013 mostly lauded the studio, video gaming and music operations. It made a reasonable case, however, that the broader portfolio of holdings could do with some tidying up.\n\nThe ideas seemed to receive a warm reception from investors. Sony shares are up 40%, outpacing Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 Index, since right around the time Loeb arrived on the scene. It helped that the $75 billion company decided last month to sell its 5% stake in Olympus, the medical equipment and camera maker, suggesting that boss Kenichiro Yoshida might be open to more restructuring.\n\nInstead, he is arguing that image sensors, mostly used in smartphones but which will have wider applications in self-driving cars and other technology, are an essential part of Sony\u2019s future. It\u2019s not obvious why it makes sense to keep the capital-intensive unit housed with \u201cSpider-Man\u201d films and PlayStation consoles. Nor is it clear whether it will ever be properly valued alongside those other businesses. It\u2019s also true, however, that now may not be the best time to separate the division. For one thing, operating profit in the semiconductor division surged 70% last quarter.\n\nLess persuasive is Sony\u2019s decision to hang onto more than half of $9.5 billion life insurance peddler Sony Financial. Trying to improve the outfit, as Yoshida says he aims to do, will come at a cost, including in terms of management distraction.\n\nSony may get some credit for being less stubborn than big portions of Japan Inc. In truth, though, its response to Loeb outlines routine steps, such as continuously reviewing its portfolio, that any sensible company ought to be doing. In terms of creating value, it sometimes pays to be moved.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - Sony\u2019s \u201cBe Moved\u201d slogan does not apply when an activist investor is applying pressure.
