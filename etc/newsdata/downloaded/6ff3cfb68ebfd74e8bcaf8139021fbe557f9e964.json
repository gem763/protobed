The hard contact caused his car to bounce back into the race track, where it was hit in by American driver Juan Manuel Correa's car, which was going an estimated 160 mph.\n\nThe collision split Hubert's car into two pieces and debris littered the track, while Correa's car was flipped upside down by the impact. Medics rushed to reach them as other driver sweved around the wreckage of both cars. The race was canceled a few minutes later.\n\nHubert was taken to an emergency center where the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), said he was pronounced dead at 6:35 p.m. local time.\n\nDALE EARNHARDT JR. SHARES HARROWING NEW DETAILS OF FAMILY'S PLANE CRASH\n\nCorrea, 20, is in stable condition and is being treated at CHU Liege hospital in Belgium, while a third driver involved in the crash, Giuliano Alesi of France, was unharmed, according to the FIA.\n\nHubert, a Renault academy driver from Lyon, began racing in 2004 and won the French F4 Championship title in 2013. He eventually worked his way up to Formula 2, debuting this past January for the British-owned Arden team and winning races in Monaco and France. He was eighth in the championship standings entering Saturday's race.\n\nHe is the first Formula 1 or Formula 2 series driver to die as the result of a racing accident since French F1 driver Jules Bianchi died in July 2015, after a head-on collision with a track-side crane at the rain-soaked Japanese GP at Suzuka in October 2014.\n\nONE ARRESTED IN EASTERN FRANCE KNIFE ATTACK THAT LEFT 1 DEAD, 9 INJURED\n\nFive-time Formula One World Champion Lewis Hamilton and Dutch driver Max Verstappen expressed their sadness about Hubert's passing on social media.\n\n\u201cIf a single one of you watching and enjoying this sport think for a second what we do is safe you\u2019re hugely mistaken,\" Hamilton said. \"All these drivers put their life on the line when they hit the track and people need to appreciate that in a serious way because it is not appreciated enough. Not from the fans [or] some of the people actually working in the sport.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Anthoine is a Hero as far as I\u2019m concerned, for taking the risk he did to chase his dreams.
