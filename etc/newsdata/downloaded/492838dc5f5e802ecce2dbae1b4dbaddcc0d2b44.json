Otherwise, it retains the same familiar design as before. The internals have been upgraded with Intel\u2019s latest-generation processors, but the Surface Pro still has a 12.3-inch display \u2014 and the Surface Type Keyboard and Surface Pen continue to be essential accessories.\n\nThe Surface Pro 7 will launch on October 22nd starting at $749. It still comes in either black or silver, but Microsoft is adding new colors of the Surface Type Color.\n\nOther products, including the Surface Go, have already integrated USB-C, but Microsoft waited the longest with its Surface Pro. The USB-C port takes the place of the Mini DisplayPort found on previous models, which allowed Microsoft to stick with its proprietary Surface Connector on the Surface Pro 7. It\u2019s worth noting that the USB-C port is not Thunderbolt 3, which might disappoint those who were hoping to plug in an external GPU.\n\nMore to love from the Pro you know.
