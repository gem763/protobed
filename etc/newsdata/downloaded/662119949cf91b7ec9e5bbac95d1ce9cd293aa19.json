Mitch McConnell has weighed in on the latest attacks on Justice Kavanaugh, suggesting that the new push for impeachment is just the latest in a series of threats against the Supreme Court by the progressive left:\n\nMcConnell, R-Ky., took to the Senate floor Monday afternoon to decry what he described as a familiar \u201cpattern\u201d involving Kavanaugh allegations: \u201cShoot first, correct the facts later.\u201d He accused Democrats of \u201crushing to exploit\u201d the new accusations and \u201chysterically\u201d demanding his impeachment, but maintained that a majority of senators were right to confirm him last year\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s just as transparent and self-serving today,\u201d McConnell said. In his blistering floor speech, he went on to rebuke several Senate Democrats for a recent brief that urged the Supreme Court to \u201cheal itself\u201d or face restructuring \u2013 which was widely seen as a threat of court-packing. \u201cThis is not normal political behavior,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nMcConnell called the NY Times story which launched the calls to impeach Kavanaugh \u201cpoorly sourced\u201d and \u201cthinly reported.\u201d You can see his full statement below. The court-packing threat he references in his speech was made last month by Democrat Senator Sheldon Whitehouse. Whitehouse submitted a brief in a New York gun case in which he suggested court-packing was coming if the court didn\u2019t rule the way Democrats wanted. \u201cThe Supreme Court is not well. And the people know it. Perhaps the Court can heal itself before the public demands it be \u2018restructured in order to reduce the influence of politics,'\u201d Whitehouse wrote.\n\nSen. Grassley also reacted to the NY Times\u2019 story about Kavanaugh yesterday on Twitter:\n\n2. Despite 7 attempts by staff, Ms. Ramirez' lawyers declined to provide documentary evidence referenced in the article/witness accounts to support the claims. They also declined invitations for Ms. Ramirez to speak with committee investigators or to provide a written statement. \u2014 Sen. Grassley Press (@GrassleyPress) September 15, 2019\n\n4. The committee's review found no verifiable evidence to support the claims. The @nytimes' own reporting at the time noted that it couldn't find anyone with firsthand knowledge & that Ms. Ramirez told friends she couldn\u2019t be sure Kavanaugh was involved: https://t.co/e1B4ckSGhr pic.twitter.com/Wj1g9dCleo \u2014 Sen. Grassley Press (@GrassleyPress) September 15, 2019\n\nRegarding the Times\u2019 story, Grassley also made a statement today on the Senate floor. \u201cI frequently refer to reports, journalists as the police of our democratic system, but today I\u2019m reminded of a very old adage: Who will watch the watchmen?\u201d He added, \u201cWe now have an uncorroborated accusation, rooted only in unnamed sources, with no direct knowledge of the event, and that the alleged victim doesn\u2019t even remember.\u201d \u201cWhen did this stuff I described become something fit to print by the supposed American paper of record?\u201d he asked.\n\nHere\u2019s McConnell\u2019s full statement:", "description": "\"This is not normal political behavior.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mitch-McConnell.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
