How do you bag an island? You just go there, really.\n\nWhere? To an island \u2013 a British one.\n\nAny island? Well, it needs to be a proper one. That means 74 acres (30 hectares) in area, or 100ft (30 metres) high, of which there are apparently 706.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it, island bagged? Yes, a bit like Munro bagging.\n\nIsn\u2019t that what Tony Curtis did in Some Like It Hot? You\u2019ve got the wrong Monroe. Munro bagging is climbing mountains in Scotland over 3,000ft, then ticking them off. People also bag lesser mountains, called Corbetts, Grahams, Marilyns \u2026\n\nMarilyn! Are you sure this has nothing to do with Norma Jeane? Quite sure: it\u2019s about mountains.\n\nI thought you said it was about islands? Sorry, you\u2019re right, it is.\n\nSo are islands the new mountains? I suppose so, in a way.\n\nAnd bagging them is the latest craze? Craze might be pushing it, but it\u2019s certainly a thing. Last year, the Highland and Islands Transport Partnership looked into launching an island passport scheme, whereby tourists would earn a stamp for each one they visit.\n\nAre the passports red? I want one: where do I apply? That\u2019s not actually up and running, but people are doing it anyway. A book called Scottish Island Bagging by Helen and Paul Webster is published next month. There are also plenty of baggable isles south of the border and in Northern Ireland. The Sunday Times reported that the leading island bagger is Rob Woodall, on 518. The leading female bagger has 130. Bee Leask, who has bagged 60 islands, has nearly 100,000 followers on her Bumblebambi Instagram account.\n\nI\u2019m in. How do I get to these islands? That\u2019s the beauty of it: it is entirely up to you. By ferry, swim, luxury yacht, stand-up paddle board, walk \u2026\n\nWalk? And if it turns out I\u2019m not the Messiah? Loads of Britain\u2019s islands can be reached on foot at low tide, probably most famously St Michael\u2019s Mount in (and sometimes off) Cornwall and Holy Island (AKA Lindisfarne) in Northumberland. Just make sure you get back in time, and don\u2019t disturb the puffins at Lindisfarne.\n\nBrilliant, especially as soon no one will be able to go abroad, because of visas and the pound being worth diddly squat. Plus no flying, so the environment wins, too.\n\nDo say: \u201cSave the planet, with a gannet.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t say: \u201cBut I just want to go somewhere hot, with a pool and paella ...\u201d\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
