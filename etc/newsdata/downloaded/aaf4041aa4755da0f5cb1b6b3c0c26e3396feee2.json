I see hundreds of male patients with the same challenges. Although I know it\u2019s embarrassing to talk about, my suggestion is that you visit your doctor and ask them to test you for two things: your heart function and your hormone levels. Erectile dysfunction can actually be a strong warning sign of blood vessel dilation problems (endothelial dysfunction) and hardened, narrowed arteries (atherosclerosis). These conditions affect not only the arteries that feed the heart, but blood vessels throughout the body\u2014including those in the penis.\n\nTestosterone: Your best friend\n\nLess drive or ambition\n\nExhaustion first thing in the morning\n\nTiredness by mid-afternoon\n\nSleepiness after dinner\n\nLess sex drive and decreased sexual performance\n\nMuscle loss\n\nWeight gain without a change in daily habits\n\nIrritability or grumpiness\n\nLack of energy\n\nDecreased strength or endurance\n\nSadness or depression\n\nDeteriorated sports ability\n\nDecreased work performance\n\nSleep disturbances\n\nLost height\n\nBone loss\n\nHot flashes, in some cases\n\nTestosterone Alone is not Enough\n\nTestosterone is a key player in sex drive and the body\u2019s ability to initiate an erection. So, much of the time, a testosterone boost is all you need overcome ED. Maybe you\u2019ve seen the television ads explaining that \u201clow T,\u201d or low testosterone levels, can be a health risk. Although the ads are by a pharmaceutical giant selling a prescription product, low testosterone is not a fake health concern created by drug companies to increase sales. In fact, low testosterone does indeed cause significant health complications that extend far beyond concerns over sex life. Healthy levels of testosterone go hand in hand with overall good health and stamina, including a leaner body, greater strength, better cholesterol management, less chance of heart disease or diabetes, better sex, and a more positive outlook on life. In a sense, this hormone is a man\u2019s fountain of youth. In the past, testosterone levels primarily declined as men aged, earning the condition the nickname \u201cmale menopause.\u201d More recently, I\u2019m seeing very low testosterone among young men, too. This is most likely caused by environmental toxins and substances in plastic packaging, but it may result from eating foods that increase estrogen levels. As my patient Sean learned, simple changes in these areas can make a big difference. Regardless of the cause, low testosterone and overall hormonal imbalances are issues that can, and should, be corrected. Surprisingly, both of these conditions also affect women, but to a lesser degree. Look at these symptoms and judge for yourself how important hormonal balance is to your health and well-being.But testosterone is not the only hormone in your body. And if one of these substances is low, the others may need support, too. That\u2019s why the best solution to the \u201clow-T\u201d problem begins with a comprehensive hormone test. Raising your testosterone levels while ignoring all the other hormones is like putting air in one tire when all four are flat. In other words, it may make a little difference, but in the end, it\u2019s not a great solution. That\u2019s why I recommend hormone testing for ALL my male patients, no matter their age.With the graying of the Baby Boomers, testosterone levels are clearly becoming a more widespread issue. As you would expect, pharmaceutical companies saw an opportunity to gain millions of new customers, so they have targeted low T with assorted testosteroneand other options. While these solutions may work at first, they are not sustainable in the long run. In fact, this is the kind of remedy that often backfires, leaving a patient worse off than they were before starting the medication. In this case, for example, taking testosterone without other related hormones sends a signal to the testes that they no longer need to make testosterone. The result: shrunken testes \u2013 exactly what most men do not want! This is not a joke \u2013 I have seen lots of patients who have made this mistake before they came to see me. How did Big Pharma get it so wrong? Once again, they\u2019re seeing dollar signs and ignoring the fact that using a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to hormone care does not work.\n\nNatural Remedies for Better Hormonal Balance\n\nAvoid or Eliminate Toxins.\n\nSkip Sugar and Starch.\n\nEat More of the Good Fats.\n\nTestosterone is just one of a number of hormones that needs to be balanced with others for best results. So simply taking testosterone by itself adds to the imbalance your body is already dealing with.You can boost your production of testosterone and related hormones with the following steps:Foods grown with all-too-common pesticides lower testosterone production and sperm counts, even in younger men. Pesticides and other toxins are hormone disruptors, and numerous animal studies show that they reduce testosterone production. Clearly, eating more organically grown food can help reduce your exposure to these testosterone thieves. To further reduce your toxic load, I highly recommend using nontoxic cleaners in your home. Don\u2019t forget that a water filter for both the faucet and shower can dramatically reduce your exposure to chemicals, toxins, and even pharmaceuticals. By filtering your drinking water, you can help eliminate exposure to chemicals in plastic water bottles. A shower filter provides even more protection. Although your skin is a protective barrier, it can absorb substances in water. I also recommend using fragrance-free personal-care products for the same reasons, something I\u2019ll be writing about more in the near future.The right combination of protein, fat, and carbohydrates helps your body produce more optimal levels of all hormones. Yet often in my practice, I find that patients eat far too much sugar and starch. Why is sugar so bad? Here\u2019s an example: One recent study found that testosterone levels fell and blood sugar levels soared after a group of men consumed just one sugar-sweetened beverage \u2014 and testosterone remained depressed for at least two hours afterward. This means that if a man consumes sugary soda or food throughout the day, his testosterone levels will be continually suppressed. Snacking on starchy foods \u2014 chips, pretzels, or crackers, for example \u2014 can have a similar effect. Cutting back on sugar and starch can also help with weight management, which, in turn, increases testosterone by reducing excess body fat. If weight is a problem, I urge you to look into weight-reduction strategies, since excess fat increases levels of the feminizing hormone estrogen.Good fats\u2014especially the omega-3 fats found in certain types of fatty fish\u2014are building blocks for healthy cell membranes. Unfortunately, roughly four out of five adults are woefully lacking in omega-3 fats . This sets the stage for hormonal dysfunction because a starved cell membrane can easily fail. Damaged cell membranes are an underlying reason for hormonal problems and many diseases, including prediabetes, diabetes, and weight problems. So you\u2019re doing more than improving your hormonal profile when you provide your body with healthy fats. In fact, according to research led by the Harvard School of Public Health, nearly 100,000 Americans die each year from too few omega-3 fats in their diets. At the same time, it\u2019s smart to reduce your intake of bad fats known as trans fats. The same Harvard study I mentioned above also found that up to 97,000 people die annually from eating too many trans fats. How much is too much? Any amount. Trans fats are vegetable oils transformed from their natural liquid state into a solid one to increase shelf life and improve the texture of processed foods. On labels, look for \u201cpartially hydrogenated\u201d oils. These could be soy, palm, or another oil \u2014 the type doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s the partial hydrogenation that makes it deadly. Trans fats are found in just about all frozen, packaged, and fast food, including pre-prepared baked goods, such as breads, buns, cakes, cookies, crackers, and snack foods. But they also turn up in salad dressings, cereals, nutrition bars, sauces, soups, ready-to-eat popcorn, and any type of boxed or frozen entr\u00e9e or side dish. Although it may take a little extra effort, try to replace bad fats with good ones through the following steps:\n\nEat cold-water fish, such as wild salmon, once per week. Take an omega-3 supplement Look for salad dressings with extra virgin olive oil, grapeseed oil, or other oils that are not particularly hydrogenated; or just use olive or grapeseed oil and vinegar or lemon juice on salads. Read the ingredients label on packaged foods, and avoid all those containing any partially hydrogenated oils. If you regularly eat out at certain restaurants, check the ingredients of your favorite dishes on the company\u2019s website, or ask at the restaurant to find options that don\u2019t contain trans fats.\n\nGet In the Exercise Habit.\n\nburns calories and helps maintain a healthy weight\n\nthins the blood and encourages healthy circulation\n\ndisposes of waste material and toxic substances in the body\n\nimproves sleep and mood\n\nstrengthens the heart and immune system\n\nreduces the risk of cancer and other serious illnesses\n\nrelieves stress\n\nfortifies muscles, joints, and bones\n\nGet Sufficient Shut-Eye.\n\nWatch Your Waist\n\nStress Less\n\nI recommend exercise of one type or another to just about all my patients, whether they have a hormonal imbalances or not. That\u2019s how important it is. Moderate exercise has many benefits:With a list of benefits like that, it\u2019s surprising that people are reluctant to get moving. If you\u2019re telling yourself you\u2019ll start working out tomorrow\u2014which, as we all know, never comes\u2014I urge you to rethink that decision and start today, particularly if you have a testosterone deficiency. While exercise is beneficial for nearly everyone, it\u2019s an especially good way to elevate testosterone levels. Of course, if you have existing medical issues, it\u2019s wise to get your doctor\u2019s okay before beginning to work out. But just about everyone can go for a 20- to 30-minute walk each day. If that\u2019s too taxing, start small. Walk around the block or down the street, and work on increasing the distance you travel each day. You may be surprised by how much being active can improve your health.Lack of deep, restorative sleep slows down natural production of both testosterone and growth hormone, which also helps to build up and maintain muscle mass and keep you lean. I recommend 7 to 8 hours nightly, preferably without prescription sleep aids that can have serious side effects. I encourage my patients who are dealing with sleep issues to look into another hormone\u2014melatonin\u2014which also works as an antioxidant. You\u2019ll not only sleep better but you\u2019ll improve your overall health at the same time.Gaining weight doesn\u2019t just make your pants too tight; it also robs you of testosterone. There are a lot of ways to lose weight. Remember, focusing on nutritious whole foods \u2013, and\u2013 is the way to go. That means avoiding processed or fast foods, with high levels of sugar, fat, and salt. As my patient, Rick, found, even confirmed \u201cburger-holics\u201d can change \u2013 and get their lives back at the same time.Most male patients are surprised when I tell them thatis one of the biggest testosterone thieves around. Here\u2019s another surprising fact\u2014a poor, low-nutrition diet can be as stressful for your body as emotional ups and downs, financial problems, job insecurity, and other situations that we usually consider to be responsible for stress. Fortunately, there are remedies for both poor diet and situational stress. For the first point, I suggest reviewing\n\nWhat supplements will boost my testosterone?\n\nmy earlier newsletters on healthy food choices . For help combating chronic stress, I urge you to look into tried-and-true solutions like mindfulness meditation, yoga, deep breathing, or regular, moderate exercise . Many patients tell me they turn to favorite hobbies as a way of reducing stress, too. The key is finding a stress reduction method that works for you and then using it regularly. Testosterone is essential for good health and stamina. In addition to its important role in sexual health, testosterone also helps maintain muscle and bone, manage cholesterol, and ward off diabetes and depression. Similarly, we now know that testosterone helps reduce inflammation and soothes pain, two vitally important benefits that can make a huge difference to your health. Taking steps to maintain sufficient levels of the hormone\u2014whether you\u2019re a man or woman\u2014has very real pay-offs for your health and happiness. Which reminds me to remind you that taking good care of yourself\u2014healthy diet, exercise, meditation\u2014is your best assurance of good emotional and cardiovascular health, which are intimately linked to a good sex life.Many men with ED have been able to regain their sexual vigor thanks to erectile dysfunction medications such as sildenafil (Viagra). These popular drugs definitely work, but not without risk. The most serious side effects include erections that do not go away (trust me, this is not as fun as it may sound) and sudden changes in vision or hearing. More commonly, though, users are often troubled by headaches, flushing, stuffy or runny nose, nausea, or dizziness. Even so, I think most men would suffer through that headache or congestion as a small price to pay for the end result. Maybe the risk of cancer will change their minds\u2026 New research has revealed a link between sildenafil and melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. In 2000, researchers questioned 25,848 men about their use of the drug. Ten years later, they established that those who took sildenafil at the start of the study\u2014and any time, really\u2014had much higher risk of melanoma. Sildenafil, which works by relaxing the muscles in the penis (leading to increased blood flow and erections), also mimics the effects of a mutant form of BRAF, a protein found in 50 percent of melanoma cases. Therein lies the problem. I can appreciate wanting to have a healthy, active sex life. But I don\u2019t think Viagra is worth the temporary or long-term risks\u2014especially when I can show you plenty of natural remedies for erectile dysfunction, and safer, equally effective options that are readily available. While supplements can\u2019t replace a healthy lifestyle, they can significantly improve testosterone functions and overall health when combined with a whole-foods diet and my other recommendations above. Some prescription meds and the supplements I recommend to my patients share a common ingredient: the amino acid l-arginine. It serves as a vasodilator that becomes the gas nitric oxide (NO)\u2014which gently, naturally relaxes all of your blood vessels, including those in the penis, where you want a strong flow of oxygen-rich blood. Below are listed several supplements that can not only boost testosterone, and increase your sexual drive and performance, but also improve your health in several other ways:\n\nOmega-3 essential fatty acids (EFAs):\n\nCoenzyme Q10 (CoQ10):\n\nCurcumin:\n\nMelatonin:\n\nPycnogenol:\n\nL-citrulline:\n\nVitamin D:\n\nDHEA:\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, omega-3s are essential for building strong cell membranes, decreasing inflammation, and fighting heart disease. I recommend taking 1 to 3 grams daily, and taking a stable, purified product, like Calamarine, which is free of toxins and chemicals.This substance is produced in the body and plays a role in energy production in the cells. Unfortunately, production slows as we age, so I recommend supplements to anyone over the age of 40. Take 100 mg daily or up to 300 mg if you suffer from high blood pressure or cholesterol, any type of heart disease or diabetes, or if you\u2019re overweight.A well-documented inflammation fighter, curcumin reduces chronic inflammation that underlies diabetes, heart disease, and aging. It also reduces body aches and pains stemming from inflammation. Take 500 mg one to three times daily.This hormone is a superstar when it comes to easing insomnia and related sleep problems. Adequate sleep is essential for healthy testosterone production as well as cell repair. 3 mg of a single-dose pill 20 minutes before bed, or 3 mg of a time-released version 30\u201360 minutes before bed. In both cases, take it with a full glass of water, and don\u2019t take both forms on the same day.Our bountiful planet comes through once again with a plant extract called pycnogenol. It works with l-arginine to lift that success rate from 12 to as high as 80 percent. And unlike the one-time meds you take when you\u2019re planning to have sex, and which wear off in time, the longer a man takes a daily supplement with both pycnogenol and l-arginine, the more the benefits add up. An Italian study clearly showed that overall satisfaction was significantly higher after three months, and higher still after six months. As an added bonus, pycnogenol is also a powerful antioxidant. What\u2019s not to like? You can take 150 milligrams daily, and safely boost that up as far as 450 milligrams.L-citrulline is an amino acid that supports healthy circulation for sexual/erectile function by helping in the creation of that nitric oxide you read about earlier. Now throw in the welcome systemic benefits\u2014a healthy arterial and cardiovascular system overall, and antioxidant powers to reduce bad LDL cholesterol. This is good medicine\u2014natural, safe, and proven effective and side-effects free. Try 1.5 grams a day.Vitamin D is the beloved \u201csunshine vitamin\u201d that our bodies produce with the help of the sun. It\u2019s also one of the essential health-makers that almost every patient I see is deficient in. If you\u2019re a D-deficient man, you\u2019re prone to low testosterone and reduced sex drive. If you\u2019re a D-deficient woman, it can cause low estrogen, which can mean low sex drive. So, if you\u2019re looking to get \u201cbusier\u201d, be sure you both have adequate levels of D. There\u2019s a simple test to find out. If you\u2019re moderately deficient, I recommend 1,500 IUs per day, man, woman, and child. Very deficient? Up to 4,000 IUs of vitamin D daily, and up to 30 minutes of direct sunlight.DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) is a hormone our bodies make that contributes to creation of sex hormones, including testosterone and estrogen. Our levels of these hormones begin to decline at age 30 or so. DHEA supplements, with the same vasodilator effect as Big Pharma and other herbal offerings, can help ensure testosterone levels are high enough for great sex. Try 25\u201350 mg daily, depending on your size, and aim for a lab test result of 250 mg present in your system.\n\nAshwagandha:\n\nHorny Goat Weed:\n\nYohimbe:\n\nTongkat Ali:\n\nThe market is flooded with cheap, dangerous frauds. Many include what are called analogues of the same potent ingredients as in Big Pharma\u2019s offerings, created by ingenious but diabolically unscrupulous chemists. These analogues often appear in potentially deadly overdose levels, and are often accompanied by useless or dangerous other drugs, such as those for treating diabetes. If there\u2019s an upside to these frauds, it\u2019s that they almost always have ridiculous names, like Mojo Rising or Night Boom. Do not go there. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to ensure the manufacturer and the formulations of any options are legitimate. As with any supplement, there can be dangerous, unwanted interactions between even the most reputable supplements and any other prescription or OTC meds you\u2019re taking.\n\nDo not take DHEA if you have cardiovascular problems.Ashwagandha is a plant-based healer that\u2019s been around forever. So it\u2019s had plenty of time to be studied extensively for its broad-spectrum benefits, including as an aphrodisiac and male performance enhancer. Research has found that ashwagandha can help boost healthy testosterone levels, essential for sexual health, energy, endurance and overall well-being, especially as we age. Aim for 675 mg daily.A 2008 lab study found that a compound in the herb horny goat weed neutralizes an enzyme that slows the healthy blood flow you need for satisfying sex\u2014an effect similar to some Big Pharma drugs. Indeed, there was evidence that horny goat weed works better than those drugs, and with fewer side effects. I recommend 900 mg daily per 150 pounds of body weight.The bark of a tree grown in western Africa, yohimbe, gives us an extract long considered a natural male enhancement ingredient. It increases blood flow, as do Big Pharma\u2019s offerings, so effectively that higher doses are available by prescription, as well as over the counter. I recommend 2.5\u20135 mg daily to start, a little more at a time if you see no improvement.A 2012 study of Tongkat Ali, a traditional Malaysian remedy for men experiencing flagging sexual performance, gave the herb to a group of men, only 35 percent of whom had normal testosterone levels. After one month, the percentage of men with normal levels jumped to more than 90 percent. A different study found that men who consumed Tongkat Ali daily experienced improvements in erectile function, libido, and volume of ejaculate. Try 200\u2013450 mg daily. These supplements should give you plenty of options. Be sure to discuss your situation with your doctor before trying or changing any supplement(s). And please, be acutely aware of two things:Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a legitimate medical issue for millions of men, and the dominant Big Pharma medications are household names for a reason: the benefits seem worth the trouble\u2014the headaches, dizziness, nasal congestion, racing pulse, pre-planning, waiting time, and so on. But there\u2019s medical need\u2026and there\u2019s just wanting a more satisfying sex life. As I mentioned, life after 40 isn\u2019t like the good old days. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re bad days, and doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t get better. So when there are safe, natural, pleasure enhancing alternatives that work perfectly well\u2014without the trouble\u2014I say go for it. Especially when what\u2019s good for your sex life is good for the entire body, and vice versa. And in some cases, an unexpected outcome can be a real blessing. Atherosclerosis, for example, causes blood-restricting fatty deposits to build up inside the arteries\u2014including those that supply the penis. Those buildups can lead to ED-type symptoms\u2014troublesome in themselves, but also maybe an invaluable warning mechanism. Because the small vessels that supply the penis are affected much sooner than the larger vessels leading to the heart, ED in younger middle-aged men can be an early sign of atherosclerosis. Knowing that can mean making behavioral changes that head off danger before it arrives. If your ED problem is a testosterone problem, not a heart problem, and you can't adjust your levels through behavior and supplements, talk with your doctor about bio-identical hormones. If your physician does not prescribe bio-identical hormones, I strongly urge you to find one who does. A prescription for a custom blend of balanced hormones, based on your individual needs (usually delivered in a cream or lotion form), may be fundamental to correcting the situation. Healthy help is here if you\u2019re careful. Take good care and enjoy the outcomes!", "description": "If you\u2019re struggling with ED, first understand that you\u2019re not .09/02/2019 3:21:00AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
