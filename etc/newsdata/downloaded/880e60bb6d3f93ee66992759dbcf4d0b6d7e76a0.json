It is not a question of us comparing ourselves versus another club.'\n\nExactly nine years ago Fenway Sports Group - then New England Sports Ventures - completed their \u00a3300million purchase of the club.\n\nJohn Henry's Fenway Sports Group took over a club crippled with debt in October 2010\n\nLIVERPOOL'S LEAGUE POSITIONS UNDER FSG 2010-11: 6th\n\n6th 2011-12: 8th\n\n8th 2012-13: 7th\n\n7th 2013-14: 2nd\n\n2nd 2014-15: 6th\n\n6th 2015-16: 8th\n\n8th 2016-17: 4th\n\n4th 2017-18: 4th\n\n4th 2018-19: 2nd\n\nTheir first job was paying off the \u00a3237million owed to major creditors Royal Bank of Scotland - ruling out any threat of the club's holding company being put into administration.\n\nThey inherited a club, unthinkably, in the Premier League's bottom three with six points from their opening seven matches during the short-lived reign of Roy Hodgson.\n\nSustained investment in the squad and infrastructure has elevated the American group to the highest point of their ownership, with the club posting \u00a3125m record profits - re-invested back into the squad even before the financial results were announced in February - winning the Champions League and starting this season brilliantly.\n\nIt has not all been plain sailing with walk-out protests over ticket price rises in 2016 and a recent issue over the failed attempt to trademark the word 'Liverpool' but on-field success has appeased fans.\n\n'From a prestige perspective it (the Champions League victory) kind of gets us back to where we once were in what we liked to call 'European royalty', so the impact is massive,' said Moore.\n\n'When we look at the health of the club our revenues have doubled in the last five years and been reinvested back into the squad. We have steadied the ship from some dark days nine years ago.\n\n'We take great pride in our business model: a self-sustaining football club.\n\n'Simply, you drive revenues as best you can to invest on the pitch and that investment on the pitch pays off and global sponsors and advertisers want to be a part of that.\n\n'They continue to give the football club revenue which will again drive investment on the pitch and we win more games.\n\n'It is a virtuous cycle and that is the modern business model for high-performing football clubs: invest, invest, invest for success.\n\nVirgil Van Dijk is Liverpool's club-record signing after his \u00a375million move in January 2018\n\n'Yes, we had that headline, \u00a3125million, but all of that money, by the time we had announced that, had been reinvested in players like Virgil Van Dijk, Alisson Becker, Naby Keita and Fabinho. But the club is in fine shape financially.\n\n'I think, as you saw from Jurgen's comments, he has the squad he likes and we have locked this squad up on long-term contracts, which is important.\n\n'He has built the chemistry and these players are content, motivated and excited to win - not just for Jurgen and the coaching staff but for the people of Liverpool and broader global fanbase.'", "description": "A sixth European Cup was secured in June, less than a month after the Reds were narrowly pipped by Manchester City to the Premier League by a point despite finishing on 97 points.", "authors": ["Carl Markham", "Press Association Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/11/19732878-0-image-a-2_1571134294760.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
