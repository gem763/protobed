Pikachu, Eevee, Charizard, Meowth, and Butterfree have been supersized with special abilities to suit players who don\u2019t want to just humiliate opponents through normal victory, but literally make them feel impossibly small.\n\nOnce in Gigantamax form, each pok\u00e9mon gets a G-Max move, like the ability to damage opponents past a single turn or paralyze opponents. Before you get too excited, know that some will take extra effort outside of Sword or Shield (and possibly $$$) to unlock. Play records from Pok\u00e9mon: Let\u2019s Go, Pikachu! and Let\u2019s Go, Eevee! on the Switch will grant you access to whichever lorge mascot version you had. Meowth is an early purchase bonus for players who select the \u201cGet via Internet\u201d option in \u201cMystery Gift.\u201d The window for Meowth is November 15th, 2019, to January 15th, 2020.\n\nWhile pok\u00e9mon like Pikachu look to be an affectionate callback to the early days of the series (or perhaps its physical merch mishaps), Meowth takes on the extremely online appearance of a longcat. I mourn for the chonker with neck rolls we could have had, but I guess this one has its perks.", "description": "Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield are upping their big boi quota with new Gigantamax forms.
