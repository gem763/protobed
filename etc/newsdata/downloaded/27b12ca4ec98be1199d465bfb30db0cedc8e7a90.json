It was a lot of things that played into this decision, and the big one was just the opportunity,\u201d Hardy told TMZ on Tuesday. \u201cThis is a big-time fight. This is a high-level competition. This is what any \u2018Prince of War\u2019 or future king of war could ever hope for.\u201d\n\nWhen Hardy (5-1 MMA, 2-1 UFC) steps into the cage Nov. 9, it will be for his fifth fight of 2019, which will set the record for most fights by a heavyweight in a calendar year. And he\u2019s well aware of the criticism he\u2019s received so far for his level of opponents and is out to prove his worth against a challenge like Volkov (30-7 MMA, 4-1 UFC), who\u2019s lost only once in the UFC and boasts 20 career knockouts.\n\n\u201cAfter this Ben Sosoli guy, he\u2019s supposed to be the huge, tough guy, and he was, and everybody\u2019s like \u2018Oh he\u2019s a can, give him some competition,'\u201d Hardy said. \u201cIt\u2019s time. It\u2019s time to make a statement. It\u2019s time to step up and put my mettle to the test as the \u2018Prince of War.\u2019 Stop talking, put the hands up, and fight with an actual monster, fight with a top-ranked, elite assassin.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since Volkov last stepped into the cage, when he suffered a dramatic third-round knockout loss to Derrick Lewis at UFC 229, a fight he was clearly winning before being finished.\n\nThe way Hardy sees it, if Lewis, whom he discredits for his punching power, was able to knock out Volkov then he likes his own chances.\n\n\u201cThe last one, soft Derrick Lewis knocked his (expletive) out,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cIf pillow hands Lewis can do it, for sure I feel like I can go in there and compete and knock this guy out. He\u2019s a monster, too.\u201d", "description": "Greg Hardy says he's ready to make some noise and turn some heads with a huge step up in competition for his fifth UFC fight.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Samano", "Abbey Subhan", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/greg-hardy-juan-adams-ufc-on-espn-4-12.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
