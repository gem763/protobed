(AP) - Mark Dantonio made it clear this week that No. 19 Michigan State needs to approach this next game with a sense of urgency.\n\n\u201cI think our guys will have motivation this week,\u201d the Spartans\u2019 coach said. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\nDantonio could smile as he said that on Tuesday, because he\u2019d spent much of his news conference voicing his dissatisfaction with last week\u2019s season-opening performance against Tulsa. The Spartans won that game 28-7, but they didn\u2019t exactly take full advantage of their opportunities. Dantonio wants to see improvement when Michigan State hosts Western Michigan on Saturday night.\n\nThe Spartans (1-0) lived up to expectations on defense in their opener, holding Tulsa to minus-73 yards rushing. That was the lowest total for an FBS team since Mississippi State held Florida to minus-78 in 2000. Michigan State also blocked a punt and forced three turnovers, so the final score could have been a lot more lopsided.\n\nIt was the offense that held the Spartans back last season, so it\u2019s understandable that Dantonio is running low on patience with that group. But Michigan State still won the game comfortably, which is an indication of how dominant the defense can be.\n\n\u201cThey present a lot of problems, and everyone\u2019s trying to solve them,\u201d WMU coach Tim Lester said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a great challenge.\u201d\n\nWMU (1-0) beat Monmouth 48-13 in its opening game. The Broncos play Michigan State regularly, and they\u2019ve been reasonably competitive recently, losing by 13 in 2013 and 2015 and by 14 in 2017. The school\u2019s last win in the series, however, was in 1919.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for the Spartans to win ugly early in the season, and Dantonio did make sure to acknowledge the stout defensive showing. He\u2019ll hope for a more complete performance this weekend.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re 1-0. There are a lot of people out there that are 0-1,\u201d Dantonio said. \u201cA lot of people wish they could have played poorly a little bit and still won. That\u2019s the message, as well. We won the football game, and we won the football game decidedly, I felt. But you\u2019re chasing perfection, and you\u2019re always trying to get better.\u201d\n\nMore things to watch when the Spartans host the Broncos:\n\nRECORD\n\nDantonio needs one win to tie Duffy Daugherty\u2019s school record of 109. He can also tie Daugherty for 13th on the Big Ten\u2019s career list.\n\nBIG PLAYS\n\nKeith Mixon had kickoff returns of 52, 26 and 65 yards for WMU in its opener. The Broncos may need plays like that on special teams if they\u2019re going to pull off the upset.\n\nPENALTIES\n\nWMU had eight penalties for 74 yards against Monmouth. Michigan State was even worse, committing 14 for 122 yards against Tulsa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve obviously got to be much more productive this week,\u201d said Brad Salem, who was promoted to offensive coordinator for the Spartans in the offseason. \u201cGrowth has to occur every week in the game of football.\u201d\n\nHEALTHY\n\nOne big bright spot for Michigan State last week was the play of Kenny Willekes, who was back after breaking his leg in the Redbox Bowl last season. Willekes recovered two fumbles, including one for a touchdown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to point to anybody on defense who did not play well,\u201d Dantonio said. \u201cThey all graded at winning level.\u201d\n\nPRODUCTIVE\n\nWMU quarterback Jon Wassink matched his career high with five touchdown passes in the opener. This next game will obviously be a tougher test.\n\nWassink threw for only 79 yards when he faced Michigan State two years ago. The Broncos did not score an offensive touchdown in that game.\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mark Dantonio made it clear this week that No. 19 Michigan State needs to approach this next game with a sense of urgency.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Noah Trister"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/michigan_st_dantonio_record_football_68320_c0-148-3536-2209_s1770x1032.jpg?0b7aa9db7f6999e4f13eb3c3edeefe1335f66a40", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
