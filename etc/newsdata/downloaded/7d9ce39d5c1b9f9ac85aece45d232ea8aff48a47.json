But it has mushroomed into a broader outcry against social economic woes including a big gap between rich and poor in a country normally considered one of the most stable in Latin America.\n\nThe conservative Pinera declared over the weekend that the country was \u201cat war against powerful, implacable enemy,\u201d but he adopted a more conciliatory tone Monday and said he wanted a \u201csocial agreement\u201d to address people\u2019s grievances.\n\nHe said the meeting with political parties was to work on \u201ca social agreement that will allow us all together to rapidly, efficiently and responsibly approach better solutions to the problems afflicting Chileans.\u201d\n\nThe violence \u2014 with widespread looting and arson and clashes with police \u2014 is the worst to hit Chile since it returned to democracy after the 1973-1990 rightwing dictatorship led by General Augusto Pinochet.\n\nThe army has been called out to provide security as part of a state of emergency and a curfew has been in force the past three nights.\n\n\u201cThis is not happening because they raised the metro fare by 30 pesos,\u201d said a man who gave his name only as Orlando, taking part in Monday\u2019s protests. He cited gripes including low salaries and pensions, waiting lists at hospitals and high prices for medicine.\n\n\u201cThis has been going on for 30 years,\u201d the 55-year-old said.\n\nThe metro fare increase has been suspended but that has not stopped the violence.\n\n\u2013 Transport scarce \u2013\n\nThe government raised the death toll by three on Tuesday, taking it to 15.\n\nEleven of the fatalities were in the Santiago region and caused by looting and arson, mainly targeting shopping centers, Deputy Interior Minister Rodrigo Ubilla told a news conference.\n\nThree of the deaths outside the capital were from gunshots, he said.\n\nAs people returned to work Monday, transport was a problem because only one of the metro\u2019s seven lines were running. Many stations were heavily damaged in the first night of violence.\n\nMany schools and universities have cancelled class.\n\nThe violence overnight Monday was less intense than other nights. A drive through the city in the early hours of Tuesday showed it largely deserted except for military vehicles and police on patrol.\n\nEarlier in several parts of the capital, protesters defiantly ignored the order and faced off with security forces.\n\nA young man died after being hit by a military truck during the looting of a fishing company in the southern city of Talcahuano, the prosecutor\u2019s office said Monday.\n\nSince the unrest began more than 2,600 people have been detained.\n\nOnce again on Monday, security forces \u2014 some 9,500 of which have been deployed \u2014 used tear gas and water cannon on the most unruly demonstrators.\n\nThousands of protesters gathered peacefully in the main Plaza Italia square in the capital on Monday, chanting \u201cPinera Out!\u201d and \u201cGet out military!\u201d\n\nArt teacher Camila Rojas, 29, said protesters had many demands, but \u201cPinera\u2019s resignation is the first thing.\u201d\n\nAnd while some broke up curbs to throw stones, smashed bus shelters, looted shops, set up barricades and started fires, the vast majority in the capital were in festive mood, chanting, banging drums, paying music and dancing.\n\n\u201cWe have to have a party to cancel out in a way those who are doing the excesses,\u201d Marcelo Gonzalez, 25, an engineering student with a drum, told AFP.", "description": "Santiago (AFP) \u2013 President Sebastian Pinera was to meet Tuesday with leaders of Chile\u2019s political parties in hopes of finding a way to end", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/22/4adf1d_demonstrators-clash-riot-police-protests-in-santiago-on-20-2019-chile-president-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
