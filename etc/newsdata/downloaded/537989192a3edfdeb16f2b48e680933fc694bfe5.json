I was married at the time, but the marriage wasn\u2019t good, so I started seeing this guy as a friend and, in the interim, told my husband it was over and divorce proceedings started.\n\nI was not intimate with this new man until everything was out in the open with my husband. We had a \u00adlong-distance relationship at first, as I lived in one county and he another and I also waited to tell my children.\n\nThings are still good between us. He started to drink more and more the longer we were together and, \u00adinevitably, arguments began. But we always make it up.\n\nAt the beginning, like any \u00adrelationship, the sex was often and great, but over the past year it\u2019s every three months or so. I have now moved my children and myself nearer to him, so we can be together.\n\nHowever, he\u2019s still more interested in going to the pub with his mates and getting drunk then he is in making sure I\u2019m happy. I feel that, at 50, my sex life is over because he still wants to behave like a single guy. It seems\n\nI made all the sacrifices while he\u2019s made none.\n\nShould I just grin and bear the \u201cno sex any more\u201d, as I\u2019ve raised the issue with him and he can\u2019t offer an \u00adexplanation for it.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\nColeen says\n\nNo, I don\u2019t think you should just grin and bear it. You had certain \u00adexpectations because you uprooted your life (and your kids\u2019 lives) to be with him and he must have led you to believe he was on board and committed.\n\nIf his feelings have changed, then he needs to be honest with you about that.\n\nAsk him for a straight answer, but you have to be prepared that you might not like what he has to say. But it\u2019s still better to know how committed he is, so you can make decisions for yourself and your children.\n\nAs far as sex goes, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good enough to just tell you he can\u2019t explain why he\u2019s not up for it.\n\nYes, it\u2019s normal for things to calm down the longer you\u2019re together \u2013 it\u2019s true of any relationship \u2013 but if you\u2019re not happy and feel he\u2019s avoiding the conversation, then you mustn\u2019t just put up with it.\n\nIt sounds as if he\u2019s doing a lot of avoiding \u2013 retreating to the pub, for example \u2013 so you have to get to the bottom of why.\n\nYou made the brave decision to leave an unhappy marriage, so you just have to find the same courage to face these worries and try to work through them.
