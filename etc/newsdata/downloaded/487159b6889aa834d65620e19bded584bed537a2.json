In trading conditions that have seen others retailers punished, JB rose 6.77 per cent to close at $36.45 following a positive update released this morning ahead of the company's annual general meeting later in the day.\n\n\"I was a bit nervous going into the AGM given the Nick Scali downgrade and a view that perhaps people weren't spending,\" said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management.\n\n\"But we're quite surprised at the sales growth at JB Hi-Fi, that's why the stocks up... today.\"\n\nAlso in retail, Myer entered a trading halt pending an announcement related to the Federal Court of Australia\u2019s judgement relating to a shareholder class action.\n\nThe judgment found that Myer misled shareholders over its forecast profits for the financial year 2015 and breached its continuous disclosure obligations.\n\nHowever, the court also ruled that shareholders had not suffered any loss because of \"the hard-edged scepticism\" of analysts who doubted the department store giant's projected profits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWiseTech woes continue\n\nWiseTech, despite mounting a partial share price recovery yesterday, took another battering in trade on Thursday.\n\nWith investors mulling over the company's dismissal of concerns raised by US short sellers J Capital, WiseTech's share price dropped 6.83 per cent over the day's trade to $26.58.\n\nWhile the stock remains 61.97 per cent above where it was 12 months ago, since the controversial J Capital report was released last week, investor concern has pushed the share price down more than 30 per cent.\n\nBut WiseTech was not the only loser in information technology. The sector was the worst performer on Thursday as valuation concerns spread through other key stocks.\n\nAfterpay slid 2.59 per cent to $29.01, Nearmap dropped 5 per cent to close at $2.82 and EML Payments shed 2.93 per cent to finish at $3.98.\n\nQantas shares also took a hit after the company warned of difficult conditions ahead, which saw it lose 3.7 per cent to $6.28.\n\nA strengthening in commodity prices saw the majority of the big miners post gains. BHP added 1 per cent to $35.75, while Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals added close to 0.5 per cent to close at $90.39 and $8.75.\n\nNewcrest mining weighed on resources stocks however, after it dropped 1.6 per cent to close at $32.02.", "description": "A fourth day of gains on the local market saw energy and resources stocks rise while concerns of valuations continued to weigh on tech stocks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c773480f29bd49c638908c71a08b3a0226155358", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
