Specifically, Trump talked up the possibility of hosting the event at his Doral, Florida, golf resort, not far from Miami International Airport.\n\nAs the Washington Post reported at the time, \u201cIf Trump does choose Doral, he would be directing six world leaders, hundreds of hangers-on and massive amounts of money to a resort he owns personally \u2013 and which, according to his company\u2019s representatives, has been \u2018severely underperforming.\u2019\u201d\n\nTake a wild guess what happened next.\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney announced Thursday that next year\u2019s Group of Seven summit meeting of world leaders will be held at President Donald Trump\u2019s Miami-area resort. [\u2026] \u201cThis is the perfect physical location to do this,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters Thursday, adding that the White House advance team visited multiple potential locations and reported back that it was \u201calmost like they built [Doral] to host this type of event.\u201d\n\nJust so we\u2019re all clear, world leaders who wish to participate in the G7 gathering will now have no choice but to spend considerable funds at the American president\u2019s own struggling business. It\u2019s a recipe for an Emoluments Clause nightmare.\n\nThis is, of course, the same American president who claims to be deeply concerned about \u201ccorruption,\u201d even as his own White House awards a lucrative contract to one of his failing enterprises.\n\nIndeed, the resort has been in \u201csharp decline\u201d for a while: \u201cAt Doral, which Trump has listed in federal disclosures as his biggest moneymaker hotel, room rates, banquets, golf and overall revenue were all down since 2015. In two years, the resort\u2019s net operating income \u2013 a key figure, representing the amount left over after expenses are paid \u2013 had fallen by 69 percent.\u201d\n\nThe venue has especially struggled in the summer months, when it\u2019s \u201cusually empty.\u201d\n\nThe G7 summit will be held in June 2020, which means Trump\u2019s business will suddenly have a lot of customers, right when they\u2019re needed most.\n\nDid I mention Doral\u2019s \u201clengthy history of health-code violations\u201d? Because that\u2019s probably relevant, too.\n\nI\u2019m sure the president\u2019s Republican allies will once again shrug their shoulders. They\u2019ll say the conflicts of interest don\u2019t matter. They\u2019ll say it doesn\u2019t matter if Trump uses his office to help the business he still owns and profits from. They\u2019ll say the foreign money flowing into the president\u2019s private-sector enterprise only looks unconstitutional. They\u2019ll say it\u2019s only a coincidence that the White House is doing a lucrative favor for Trump\u2019s struggling business.\n\nI\u2019m less sure why they think anyone would find their arguments persuasive.", "description": "World leaders who wish to participate in the G7 gathering will now have no choice but to spend considerable funds at the American president's own business.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_bwms_doral_190826_1920x1080.jpg?itok=3uhw48R2", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
