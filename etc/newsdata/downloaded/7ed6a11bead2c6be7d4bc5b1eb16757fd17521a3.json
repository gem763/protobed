His reluctance to answer questions about the family separation policy made it difficult for me to assess his record and impeded my constitutional duty to evaluate his fitness to serve as a judge.\n\nAfter careful consideration of Mr. Menashi\u2019s nomination with these concerns in mind, I do not believe he is well-suited to serve on the federal bench.", "description": "She is the first Republican senator to come out against Trump's court pick, who has a record of opposing rights for women, LGBTQ people and minorities.", "authors": ["Senior Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db087a82100005f2534ad7b.jpeg?cache=iqxzel03tp&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
