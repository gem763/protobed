Luigi carried a Game Boy Horror in the series\u2019 GameCube debut. It was a riff on the Game Boy Colour, which was slightly outdated even in 2001.\n\nWhen the series made its long-awaited return on the 3DS for 2013's Luigi\u2019s Mansion: Dark Moon, Luigi upgraded to the Dual Scream, which was based on the quickly-discontinued \u201cfat\u201d model of the Nintendo DS.\n\nAnd of course Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 on the Switch has its own take on this, one close to my own heart. Nintendo actually discussed this and showed it off a bit during a Treehouse Live segment at this year\u2019s E3, but the news hasn\u2019t really propagated much, so I\u2019m going to err on the side of caution here and call it a spoiler. Turn back if you don\u2019t want to know!\n\nEarly on in the game, Professor E. Gadd gives Luigi a way to communicate with him as he trawls the many floors of the hotel. It\u2019s his latest invention\u2026 the Virtual Boo.\n\nScreenshot: Nintendo, Kotaku\n\nNearly 25 years later, the Virtual Boy still fascinates video game likers for its sheer ridiculousness; a \u201cvirtual reality\u201d system that projected monochrome red graphics in a headset to create a rudimentary 3D effect. It was pure out-of-left-field Nintendo, but this time it was way over the foul line, and Nintendo had to discontinue Virtual Boy within a year of its release.\n\nScreenshot: Nintendo, Kotaku\n\nI don\u2019t think the Virtual Boo is going to do much better commercially, regardless of what Gadd thinks.\n\nScreenshot: Nintendo, Kotaku\n\nWhen Luigi gets a call from Gadd, he pops the headset on his face, where everything is rendered in shades of harsh LED red.\n\nScreenshot: Nintendo, Kotaku\n\nActually, the game\u2019s entire menu is Virtual Boy style, an excellent example of \u201ccommitting to the bit.\u201d\n\nScreenshot: Nintendo, Kotaku\n\nLater, when you become able to spend money on extra parts for the Virtual Boo, they even come in authentic Virtual Boy cartridge casings.\n\nScreenshot: Nintendo, Kotaku\n\nI think we can all agree that as the years go on, E. Gadd\u2019s gadgets are becoming much better, and also much, much worse.", "description": "Luigi\u2019s heading back to another haunted mansion (well, a haunted hotel) in Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 this Halloween, and he\u2019s got many more tricks up his sleeve for busting ghosts, including one gadget that\u2019s a wonderful reference to a classic Nintendo console of yore....", "authors": ["Sarah Basford", "Cecilia D'Anastasio"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/ms62qn3cygjym2qv8iaj.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
