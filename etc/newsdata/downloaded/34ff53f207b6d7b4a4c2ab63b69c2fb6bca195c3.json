The good news for Republicans is that two \u2014 and maybe three \u2014 of their core complaints about the House process are being addressed here.\n\nOne: They objected that there was no formal vote authorizing the inquiry. This resolution, affirming that the ongoing inquiry is fully authorized, will be voted on tomorrow.\n\nTwo: They objected that Trump isn\u2019t allowed to have his lawyers present. This resolution does create a role for the president\u2019s attorneys \u2014 potentially. Section 4(a), which grants the House Judiciary Committee power to conduct impeachment proceedings, provides that it will be bound by rules promulgated by the Rules Committee \u201cincluding such procedures as to allow for the participation of the President and his counsel.\u201d Note that that does not mean that Trump\u2019s lawyers get to participate in questioning witnesses during testimony before the House. They\u2019ll get to cross-examine witnesses later, at the Senate trial. As I understand it, their participation in the House would begin only after Nadler\u2019s committee finally begins weighing final articles of impeachment. Two Democratic aides tell WaPo that Trump\u2019s lawyers will have the same rights as Bill Clinton\u2019s did in 1998.\n\nThree: They objected that House Republicans had been denied the power to call witnesses of their own. Everyone whom the House has heard from to date has been called by the Democratic chairs of the various committees. When does the GOP gain the power to bring in witnesses who might challenge the Democratic narrative?\n\nSoon, according to this resolution. But there\u2019s a catch: Any request to invite a witness to testify or attempt to subpoena him offered by the GOP\u2019s ranking member, Devin Nunes, must be approved by the chair of the relevant committee. That would be Adam Schiff.\n\n\u201cWith the concurrence of the chair.\u201d If Schiff rejects a subpoena, Nunes can take his request to the full committee \u2014 but since Democrats have a majority on every House committee, there\u2019s near-zero chance of Schiff\u2019s decision being overruled.\n\nAlthough that reminds me: Who, exactly, does the GOP want to subpoena? Which witnesses to Trump\u2019s Ukraine behavior are they itching to have testify but which Democrats supposedly are refusing to call? Mick Mulvaney? That might not go so well. Don\u2019t say Rudy either. If you\u2019ve seen a single Giuliani interview over the past six weeks, you know why Republicans should be terrified of putting him under oath in front of a microphone.\n\nYou may be wondering why it\u2019s Schiff and Nunes, the heads of the Intelligence Committee, who are tasked with holding these hearings instead of Jerry Nadler, the head of the Judiciary Committee. It\u2019s normally Judiciary that handles testimony on impeachment matters, right? Indeed \u2014 but Pelosi has her reasons for leaving this in Schiff\u2019s hands instead:\n\nPelosi, D-Calif., has reportedly been underwhelmed by the handling of Trump-related hearings by Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y, for some time, culminating with the embarrassing testimony of former Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski\u2026 [T]he decision to hold the most dramatic hearings in Schiff\u2019s committee is a strategic move to try to keep the impeachment process focused. The Intelligence Committee is much smaller than most other House committees, with only 22 members compared to 41 in Judiciary and many other committees. The Judiciary Committee is also home to some of the most outspoken and confrontational Republicans, such as ranking member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs, R-Ky., and others.\n\nSchiff may also be more comfortable than Nadler is in telling Republicans no, as he\u2019s had years of practice from clashing with Nunes on the Intel Committee. Just today, allegedly, he blocked several Republican questions during Alexander Vindman\u2019s testimony which he thought were aimed at unmasking the whistleblower. \u201cAccording to two knowledgeable people, a top staffer to Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) has been circulating the identity of a person believed to be the whistleblower among House Republicans,\u201d says the Daily Beast. Apparently some of the queries put to Vindman were aimed at trying to \u201cput a universe of individuals who had been communicated with on the table,\u201d per Debbie Wasserman Schultz, to try to narrow the possible suspects. There\u2019s not a lot that could make the Ukraine ordeal worse politically for the GOP at this point but outing the whistleblower despite the law\u2019s offer of anonymity is one of them. Especially now that the original complaint has become less relevant to the inquiry thanks to firsthand testimony from the likes of Sondland, Bill Taylor, and Vindman.\n\nOne last noteworthy tidbit from the resolution:\n\nSchiff now has the power to release full transcripts of witness testimony. I\u2019ll be curious to see how aggressively he does or doesn\u2019t exercise it given Republican complaints that he\u2019s been distorting witness testimony via selective leaks to make Trump look as bad as possible.", "description": "Power.", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/s-6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
