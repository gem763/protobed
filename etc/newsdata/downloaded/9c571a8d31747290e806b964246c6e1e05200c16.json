Last month proved disappointing for money managers betting on rising stocks and stronger currencies amid trade tension and a resurgent dollar. September may not be much better, with Argentina imposing capital controls amid a currency crisis.\n\n\u201cFor EM prospects to improve, we would need to see the Fed turning more proactively dovish and/or trade tensions abating,\u201d Morgan Stanley strategists including James Lord in London wrote in a note. \u201cNeither of these outcomes seem likely for now.\u201d\n\nMorgan Stanley said it expects developing-nation currencies to depreciate about 2% against the greenback in the coming month.\n\nListen here for the emerging markets weekly podcast.\n\nThe erratic U.S.-China trade narrative was still in the spotlight as U.S. tariffs on about $110 billion of Chinese goods went into effect Sunday, as did Beijing\u2019s countermeasures. Data at the weekend showed a further deterioration in manufacturing output from the world\u2019s No. 2 economy.\n\nCapital Controls\n\nArgentina\u2019s central bank set a limit of five days for exporters to repatriate foreign currency, while institutions will need need authorization of the bank to buy dollars in the foreign exchange market, except in the case of foreign trade. Individual Argentines will be limited to dollar purchases of no more than $10,000 a month\u201cThis\u2019ll add to the volatility and will add to the confusion over what\u2019s going on in Argentina,\u201d said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at Natalliance Securities in New York. People have become more risk averse as the volatility increased all through the month of August when it comes to emerging markets, he said\n\nEye for an Eye\n\nOn Monday, China\u2019s Caixin Manufacturing PMI showed a surprise expansion to 50.4 in August compared with a consensus estimate of 49.8 and a reading of 49.9 in the previous month. A score above 50 signals expansion, while less than 50 a contractionThe Caixin PMI\u2019s surprise jump back into expansion shouldn\u2019t be seen as a genuine improvement in China\u2019s export sector as the latest wave of U.S. trade-war tariffs will put more pressure on exporters, according to Chang Shu, chief Asia economist for Bloomberg EconomicsAugust PMI reported on Monday by China\u2019s trading partners such as Taiwan, South Korea, and Indonesia indicate contractions, as trade uncertainty works its way up and down the value chainMalaysia\u2019s trade numbers are due on Wednesday, which will be one of the last key data points before Bank Negara Malaysia\u2019s monetary policy meeting on Sept. 12. Meanwhile, South Korea will release final figures for its second-quarter GDP on TuesdayPoland will announce official FX reserves for August on Friday\n\nMore Cuts\n\nRussia is expected to deliver its third quarter-point cut in a row on Friday as inflation slows and the economy sputters. While all but one of the 16 economists polled by Bloomberg predict a reduction to 7%, traders will be on the lookout for any hawkish signals after the ruble\u2019s monthly slideIn Chile, the central bank will probably carry out its second interest rate reduction in the past three months as growth stalls and inflation slows dramatically\n\nEconomic Data\n\nInflation data are due from a slew of Asian countries. Thailand and Indonesia on Monday reported slower-than-estimated figures. South Korea follows on Tuesday, Philippines on Thursday and Taiwan on FridayBrazil is expected to show a sustained decline of consumer price inflation in Friday\u2019s reading of August data, which could increase the odds of another rate cut in mid-SeptemberData in Colombia will probably show consumer prices picked up for a sixth month, leaving the central bank scant leeway to cut borrowing costs at its September meetingTurkey\u2019s economy expanded 1.2% in the three months through June, from 1.3% the quarter before, well above the median of six estimates Traders will be bracing from a raft of data from South Africa. The country probably avoided its second recession since the beginning of 2018, data may show on Tuesday. Gross domestic product probably expanded 2.5% in the second quarter, after contracting the quarter before, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The current-account deficit probably widened to 3.1% of GDP in the same quarter, from 2.9%, data may show on ThursdayNigeria\u2019s economic growth probably quickened in the second quarter to 2.5%, from 2% the quarter before, data may show on Tuesday\n\n--With assistance from Lilian Karunungan and Emily Barrett.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Sydney Maki in New York at smaki8@bloomberg.net;Robert Brand in Munich at brandr@bloomberg.net;Marcus Wong in Singapore at mwong547@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Julia Leite at jleite3@bloomberg.net, Alec D.B.
