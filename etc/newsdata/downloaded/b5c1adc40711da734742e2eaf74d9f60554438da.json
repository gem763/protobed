We had hope for the future.\u2019\n\nHe continued: \u2018She was very fit and active and a fantastic mum to Harry. At work, she was like a mother figure to a lot of people that worked there.\n\nDave Bithell is battling incurable cancer (Picture: BPM MEDIA)\n\n\u2018Aneurysms just come on really quickly, it can just happen like that \u2013 and it did \u2013 it just happened out the blue.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m up and down like a yo-yo, one minute I\u2019m alright, the next I\u2019m in floods of tears. It\u2019s like a bad dream. It\u2019s the last thing we expected.\n\n\u2018Sharon was going to be the breadwinner when I was going through all my treatment, so we just didn\u2019t have any indication of this happening.\u2019\n\nCatering team leader Sharon was born in Chelmsley Wood, and later moved to Solihull, where she attended Lode Heath School.\n\nShe then settled down in Southampton with Dave and the pair focused on raising their son.\n\nThe couple have a son, Harry, together (Picture: BPM MEDIA)\n\nDave was later diagnosed with incurable stage four mantle cell lymphoma and started chemotherapy treatment in the hope of extending his life by up to a decade.\n\nHowever, he says it\u2019s possible he could be given just two more years to live.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is unable to work until his treatment finishes in July next year, and both his and Sharon\u2019s parents have moved into the area to help the family out.\n\nDave said: \u2018[The cancer] is incurable so at some point, I might go into remission.\n\nPensioner survives despite getting crushed under lorry on mobility scooter\n\n\u2018One of the consultants said to me: \u201cIf you had this five years ago your chances of survival would be poor, but now its quite likely that we can give you another five years.\u201d\n\n\u2018Maybe I might get ten years, I might get five \u2013 I might get two, we just don\u2019t know.\u2019\n\nFamily friend Louise Facey set up a GoFundMe page shortly before Sharon died, which has so-far raised nearly \u00a39,500.\n\nBefore her death, they recorded her progress, with Dave reported as saying: \u2018I only got 20 minutes with Sharon awake today in four hours, but it was worth it.\n\n\u2018I put the earphones in and played her these tunes below. Sharon was smiling, singing badly and her leg was going like Billy-o. It was pure joy.\u2019\n\nLouise also noted that Sharon had \u2018put her name on the organ donation list twice\u2019 because it was the \u2018kind of person she was\u2019.\n\nYou can donate to the GoFundMe page here.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
