Bush at game: 'Be kind to one another'", "language": "en", "text": "Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres defended herself Tuesday against criticism when a photo showed her sitting next to former President George W. Bush.\n\nAfter a photo went viral Sunday showing the two sitting next to each other during Sunday\u2019s football game between the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys, Ms. DeGeneres \u2014 who is lesbian \u2014 responded to criticism that it was \u201cpathetic\u201d for her to sit next to someone who \u201cworked against the LGBT community.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the game, they showed a shot of me and George laughing together. And so, people were upset,\u201d Ms. DeGeneres told the audience of her show \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show.\u201d \u201cThey thought, \u2018Why is this gay Hollywood liberal sitting next to a conservative Republican president?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing. I\u2019m friends with George Bush. In fact, I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have. We\u2019re all different, and I think that we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s OK,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhen I say \u2018be kind to one another,\u2019 I don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone. Doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Ms. DeGeneres added.\n\nShe discussed how the daughter of Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, invited her and her wife \u2014 \u201cArrested Development\u201d actress Portia La Rossi \u2014 to the \u201cfancy\u201d VIP area of the team\u2019s stadium, and they accepted the invite because they \u201cwanted to keep up with the Joneses.\u201d\n\nMs. DeGeneres said she knew this \u201cvery fancy suite\u201d with \u201cfancy friends\u201d would be filled with people who disagree with her on her beliefs, but she said they still had \u201cso much fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we were invited, I was aware that I was going to be surrounded by people with very different views and beliefs. And I\u2019m not talking about politics. I was rooting for the Packers,\u201d Ms. DeGeneres joked, before ending with a message to Mr. Bush.\n\n\u201cYou owe me $6 for the nachos.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
