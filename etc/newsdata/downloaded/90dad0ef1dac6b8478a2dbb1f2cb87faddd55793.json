Purdue Pharma, L.P., et al., Case No. 17-OP-45004; and The County of Summit, et al. v. Purdue Pharma, L.P., et al., Case No. 18-OP-45090 (collectively, the \"Track 1 Cases\").\n\nMallinckrodt logo More\n\nThe settlement fully resolves the Track 1 Cases against all named Mallinckrodt entities that are currently scheduled to go to trial in October, 2019, in the MDL. The Track 1 Cases assert various claims related to the opioid business operated by SpecGx LLC.\n\nUnder the agreement, Mallinckrodt will pay $24 million in cash and provide $6 million in generic products, including addiction treatment products. It also will provide a $500,000 payment in two years in recognition of the counties' time and expenses. Further, in the event of a comprehensive resolution of government-related opioid claims, Mallinckrodt has agreed that the two plaintiff counties will receive the value they would have received under such a resolution, less the payments described above. All named Mallinckrodt entities will be dismissed with prejudice from the lawsuit. The value of the settlement should not be extrapolated to any other opioid-related cases or claims.\n\n\"Mallinckrodt is pleased to finalize this settlement agreement with the Cuyahoga and Summit Counties,\" said Mark Casey, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer of Mallinckrodt. \"With the Track 1 Cases resolved, we look forward to focusing our efforts on achieving a global resolution of all the opioid lawsuits.\"\n\nFor more information on Mallinckrodt's work to combat prescription drug abuse and misuse, please visit www.mallinckrodt.com/solutions .\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT MALLINCKRODT\n\nMallinckrodt is a global business consisting of multiple wholly owned subsidiaries that develop, manufacture, market and distribute specialty pharmaceutical products and therapies.
