And it is that. But the fleshy, dazzling surface of \u201cHustlers,\u201d written and directed by Lorene Scafaria, cloaks an empowering feminist tale about a sisterhood of women who turn the tables on a male-controlled industry.\n\n\u201cPeople go into the movie expecting something because stripper is a word that has so many connotations and preconceived notions,\u201d says Scafaria. \u201cThat\u2019s the hustle. Hopefully we\u2019re subverting expectations but subverting them in a way that has some nuance to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHustlers,\u201d opening in theaters this week following its well-received premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, stars Jennifer Lopez as Ramona, a veteran stripper in New York who takes a young dancer (Constance Wu) under her wing. Ramona organizes a scam to drug Wall Street guys and max out their credit cards. It\u2019s loosely based on a true story, chronicled in a 2015 New York magazine article, and set in the years after the 2008 financial crisis - when far greater, white-collar swindles went largely unprosecuted.\n\nThe transactional world of strip clubs - so commonly depicted from a male viewpoint in movies - has seldom been viewed through a female gaze like it is in \u201cHustlers.\u201d It\u2019s a microcosm, Lopez says, of America.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a strip club,\u201d says Lopez. \u201cYou have people tossing the money and people doing the dance.\n\n\u201cThis film says something about the inequality that we\u2019ve been yelling and screaming about for a while now and kind of making some headway,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd I hate saying that so broadly because I love men and there are so many great, supportive beautiful men in the world. But there is this thing that exists that we can\u2019t deny.\u201d\n\n\u201cHustlers\u201d might be Lopez\u2019s most radiant and regal screen performance, too, since Steven Soderbergh\u2019s 1998 film \u201cOut of Sight.\u201d As Ramona, she\u2019s the matriarchal ringleader of an improvised family of strippers-turned-hustlers. (Cardi B makes her big-screen debut, alongside a cast including Lili Reinhart and Keke Palmer.)\n\nLopez is, like Ramona, an entrepreneur from the Bronx. She instantly identified with the role, even if the stripping scenes gave her pause.\n\n\u201cIt was scary. I saw the script and it wasn\u2019t like boobs everywhere. That wasn\u2019t (Scafaria\u2019s) thing,\u201d says Lopez. \u201cBut I also knew I was playing a stripper and I\u2019m a mom and what does that all mean? But I felt good about how Lorene wanted to tell the story and that it was something I could be proud of it.\u201d\n\nScafaria, the 41-year-old writer of \u201cNick & Norah\u2019s Infinite Playlist,\u201d observed how much training Lopez put into the part. As experienced a dancer as she is, pole-dancing was something else entirely. Lopez\u2019 resplendent entrance in the movie is a stage dance set to Fiona Apple\u2019s \u201cCriminal\u201d while being showered with bills.\n\n\u201cIt was like acrobatics. I had to start lifting more weights. I had to change my body,\u201d says Lopez. \u201cI told her, \u2018I have to change my body if I do this.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Please don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about,\u2019\u201d retorts Scafaria, laughing.\n\nIn just the past two years, Lopez has released new Spanish-language tracks, launched a cosmetic line, got engaged to former baseball player Alex Rodriguez and recently concluded a 38-concert tour. Time Magazine has ranked her among the 100 most influential people in the world. \u201cSecond Act,\u201d released in 2018, proved movie audiences still love her. It grossed $72.2 million worldwide. She\u2019s also a producer on \u201cHustlers.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople think \u2018Oh, she\u2019s not a serious recording artist.\u2019 Or, \u2018she\u2019s not really a serious actress,\u2019 or \u2018She\u2019s not really a serious entrepreneur.\u2019 No, I\u2019m very serious about all of them. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve spent most of my life doing as many of those things as possible,\u201d says Lopez. \u201cBecause I do all those things, I don\u2019t get the credit at times - which is fine, I don\u2019t care. I love what I do. I have the most amazing life. I feel good about my life. I feel good about where I am.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve had to kind of give myself that pat on my back: \u2018You\u2019re doing good,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cOnce I started doing that, my whole life changed.\u201d\n\n\u201cHustlers,\u201d however, already has a lot of people heaping praise on Lopez. Scafaria says the part of Ramona \u201cfits her like a glove - even if it\u2019s not a glove she\u2019s tried on in the same way.\u201d\n\nThe performance has catapulted Lopez into the awards conversation this fall. \u201cHustlers\u201d may be about a broken value system, but it\u2019s brought renewed appreciation for Lopez as an actor. Lopez, who turned 50 in July, says an Oscar would be \u201ca tremendous moment in my life.\n\n\u201cYou dedicate your whole life to doing what you love, and you do it because you love it. But it\u2019s also nice when somebody says, \u2018Hey, we think you do it great,\u2019\u201d says Lopez. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to think about it. I usually get tears in my eyes.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP\n\n___\n\nFor complete coverage of the fall film season, visit: www.apnews.com/FallFilms\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"Hustlers\" is, in itself, a hustle.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jake Coyle"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/film_review_-_hustlers_95045_c0-72-1728-1079_s1770x1032.jpg?52ad6eb5bd0c9c41e562c9ace710d45a7bc40fe5", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
