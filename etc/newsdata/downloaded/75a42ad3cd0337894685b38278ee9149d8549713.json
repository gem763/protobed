(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nThey arrived by foot, car, Uber and scooter. Some wore their best interview suits, others wrinkled T-shirts.\n\nMany already had jobs \u2014 no surprise in an era of historically low unemployment and a booming national economy. But now Amazon, the world\u2019s largest Internet company, was beckoning. And these folks wanted in.\n\n\u201cI really want someone to give me a chance. Everyone wants to work here,\u201d said Leo Versel, 26, of Rockville, one of hundreds, maybe thousands, of people in a line that snaked down 12th Street South and around the corner onto Army Navy Drive in Arlington on Tuesday morning.\n\nAlso hopeful was John Mackell, 26, of Bladensburg, Md., who works in security and graduated two years ago from Towson University. \u201cI feel like they\u2019re very diverse in their hiring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Amazon is one of the leading companies out there.\u201d\n\nThe retail giant\u2019s first Career Day drew a racially, ethnically and age-diverse crowd to the Northern Virginia neighborhood where the company plans a second headquarters that should employ 400 by year\u2019s end and 25,000 jobs within a decade.\n\nEvent organizers opened the doors early and extended hours until 8 p.m. once they gauged the numbers.\n\nThis \u2014 these lines of eager job-seekers, the newly polished r\u00e9sum\u00e9s \u2014 was the reception they were hoping for when Amazon chose Arlington for the headquarters campus last winter. Similar events were being held in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Nashville and Seattle, where Amazon is based (company founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos also owns The Washington Post.)\n\n\n\nInside a giant tent in Crystal City, thousands interested in working for Amazon learned more about the company. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for a job in user experience or user interface or front-end development,\u201d said Amalia Cowan, 27, of Rockville, a year out of college and \u201clooking to get my foot in the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone else has tech and human resources, and I pretty much fit the bill on the legal side,\u201d said retired attorney Benny Estorga, 68, a Los Angeles-area resident who is visiting his son\u2019s family in the Washington region and wants to be able to spend more time with them.\n\nAmazon \u201cmay make me a mail clerk, but I don\u2019t care,\u201d Estorga said. \u201cIf I can get a job, I will move out here.\u201d\n\nTo the disappointment of some, Amazon wasn\u2019t offering jobs Tuesday, or officially taking r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. Rather, the event was an chance for potential applicants to talk to recruiters, get tips on how to advance, and learn about jobs and businesses within the company.\n\n\u201cI had high expectations,\u201d Morteza Loghmani, 52, said as he left the event about 11 a.m. \u201cIt was encouraging, but it looks like it\u2019s more selling of Amazon \u2014 it seemed like they mostly were promoting their brand.\u201d\n\nInside the tent housing the event, scores of employees wearing blue-branded T-shirts talked to small clusters of hopefuls, explaining the culture and attitude that is rewarded within the company.\n\nBaskets of fruit and bottled water were available outside and inside. People wandered among booths labeled military recruiting, Alexa services, training and certifications, warehouse-drivers-shopping and more.\n\n\u201cYour supervisor may ask what was your bias toward action,\u201d senior recruiter Justin Joseph told a half-dozen anxious job-seekers. \u201cWe look for focus on customers. ... You may have applied online and that\u2019s great, but I\u2019m taking hard copies as well because we\u2019re going to go through them all.\u201d\n\nSix hands thrust forward with neatly printed r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.\n\n\n\nKevin Ahearn, second from right, gives r\u00e9sum\u00e9 advice to Chris Young, center, of Annandale, at Amazon Career Day in Arlington. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cI want a part-time job, because I\u2019m a mom with a special-needs kid who\u2019s going to kindergarten this year and I\u2019d like to find a place where I can feel good about myself for five hours a day,\u201d Liana Pidlusky, 42, of Alexandria, told a reporter. She worked in finance before becoming a mother and hopes to return to the field.\n\nThe company is facing heightened scrutiny over antitrust issues and has been criticized for poor working conditions in warehouses, harsh productivity quotas and an overreliance on contract workers.\n\nBut those who turned out Tuesday weren\u2019t focused on the negative.\n\nRane Om, 33, of Stafford, Va., who is between jobs, said she would work \u201cwherever they think I belong.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me, where you need me?\u201d she said. \u201cI like cybersecurity, or physical security.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, a woman wheeled a baby carrier through the crowd, her child adorned in an Amazon onesie. Others lined up for r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reviews and interview tips.\n\nThe line continued to wind down the block throughout the afternoon, and as the sun came out, Amazon contractors handed out bottles of water. By 6 p.m., Amazon officials said, about 4,000 potential job-seekers had entered the tent. Others were still waiting.\n\nMark Clinard, a manager at a wine importer who arrived in the morning, said he believed he had strategies and know-how that Amazon needs.\n\n\u201cAlcohol sales. Because they don\u2019t have an alcohol sales plan. They\u2019ve tried and failed three times, and I think I have the solution,\u201d Clinard said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only section of the direct consumer market they\u2019re missing.\u201d\n\nJaida Hodge, 24, said she was \u201clooking for a complete career change.\u201d The Capitol Heights, Md., resident had worked for an Amazon vendor and now wants to become \u201ca receptionist, or maybe something in the IT field.\u201d\n\nRobert Williams, 30, came from New York specifically for the event.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in finance now, and I like Amazon as a growth company,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it would be a cool opportunity.\u201d\n\n\n\nLianjie Shan, left, of Crystal City, shows his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to Amazon\u2019s LaDavia Drane at the Career Day event Tuesday.
