On this week\u2019s podcast, Lithgow says that he wasn\u2019t the likeliest person to write a book addressing contemporary politics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m basically a fairly spineless person, politically,\u201d Lithgow says. \u201cI have my passionate politics but I keep them to myself. There\u2019s something in me that edits myself because I\u2019m an actor, because I feel hesitant to trade on my celebrity \u2014 to the extent that I have any \u2014 to put forth my own political opinions. But the Trump era has sort of changed that. I think it\u2019s happened with a lot of people. You just become more vocal because you\u2019re more distressed by the situation.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nLeigh Bardugo, who\u2019s written best-selling books like \u201cSix of Crows\u201d for young adults, visits the podcast this week to discuss her first novel for adults, \u201cNinth House.\u201d The novel, set at a fictionalized Yale, is about a young woman with a very troubled past who has the rare ability to see ghosts. \u201cFantasy almost always operates as some kind of metaphor for what we\u2019re experiencing in the real world or real life,\u201d Bardugo says. The character\u2019s \u201cability to see through the veil, to see things that other people can\u2019t, is very much a metaphor for the way that women are ignored and not believed when they speak.\u201d", "description": "The actor talks about \u201cDumpty: The Age of Trump in Verse,\u201d and Leigh Bardugo discusses \u201cNinth House.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/books/25dumpty/25dumpty-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
