Brexit campaign insiders lamented the destruction of Johnson\u2019s \u201chead of steam,\u201d and an end to the momentum created by his unlikely success in securing a deal from Europe.\n\nAfter another vote that went against Johnson last month, the prime minister is now legally mandated to write to the EU asking for an extension to January 31. The government formally asked for the extension Saturday night, but also sent a letter from Johnson arguing against the delay.\n\nEU Council President Donald Tusk said in a tweet that he had received the request. \u201cI will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson is expected to bring the withdrawal legislation to the floor of the House of Commons early next week, so he may only have to wait a few days to secure victory but Labour opponents\u2014and nervous No. 10 insiders\u2014believe that potential support for the deal may ebb away once lawmakers get the chance to fully examine the fineprint.\n\nJust two days after Johnson was back-slapping European counterparts and clasping hands with fellow leaders, his precarious grip on power was underlined once again in a vote that went against him by 322 to 306.\n\nIn response, Johnson stood up and said he would refuse to \u201cnegotiate\u201d a further extension with the EU. He stopped short of saying he would refuse to comply with the law and send the extension letter, although he reiterated his hopes that the EU would not immediately grant an extension. \u201cI don't think they'll be attracted by delay,\u201d he said.\n\nAs lawmakers continued to debate the result, Johnson sat slumped on the frontbench shaking his head.\n\nIt was a sharp contrast to his mood two days earlier. Tickled pink with the deal he had unexpectedly secured from the EU, Johnson had sought to rush back to Westminster and bounce parliament into agreeing.\n\nOne of his own long-term colleagues, Sir Oliver Letwin, had other ideas.\n\nLetwin is a veteran Conservative right-winger who has been in the heart of Conservative thinking for decades. He was a member of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Downing Street policy unit in the 1980s and entrusted by David Cameron to write the Tory manifesto in 2010.\n\nHe was kicked out of the party last month by Johnson after voting to ensure there wouldn\u2019t be a No Deal Brexit.\n\nHe exacted his revenge on Saturday by wrecking Johnson\u2019s chance for a victorious homecoming.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
