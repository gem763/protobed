REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe Commerce Department\u2019s snapshot of gross domestic product on Wednesday will likely sketch a picture of an economy that is losing speed, but not tipping into recession as financial markets had feared earlier this year. The economy is being hamstrung by the Trump administration\u2019s 15-month trade war with China, which has eroded consumer and business confidence.\n\nThe fading stimulus from last year\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut package and weakening growth overseas is also crimping the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year.\n\nThe GDP report will be published hours before Fed officials wrap-up a two-day policy meeting. The U.S. central bank is expected to cut interest rates for the third time on Wednesday. The Fed cut rates in September after reducing borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008.\n\n\u201cA continued loss of momentum not only justifies earlier action taken by the Fed, but further perpetuates the need for additional policy stimulus to stave off a continued downward trend in domestic activity,\u201d said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel in Chicago.\n\nGross domestic product probably increased at a 1.6% annualized rate in the third quarter, also because of a smaller inventory build, according to a Reuters survey of economists, after rising at a 2.0% pace in the April-June period.\n\nThe trade deficit was probably less of a drag on GDP growth last quarter. The gap, however, likely narrowed because the flow of goods was restricted by import tariffs and weakening global growth to levels that economists said suggested a further loss of speed in domestic activity.\n\nThe anticipated third-quarter growth pace would mark a further deceleration from the 3.1% rate logged in the first quarter, indicating the economy will again miss the White House\u2019s ambitious goal of 3.0% annual growth. Growth peaked in the second quarter of 2018, when it was jolted by the tax cuts and increased defense spending.\n\nThe economy grew 2.9% in 2018 and growth this year is expected to be below 2.5%. Economists estimate the speed at which the economy can grow over a long period without igniting inflation at between 1.7% and 2.0%.\n\nWhile President Donald Trump this month announced a truce in the trade war with China, delaying additional tariffs that were due in October, economists say growth remains in danger without all duties being rolled back. A Trump administration official said on Tuesday the interim trade agreement might not be ready for signing in Chile next month as expected.\n\n\u201cThe interim trade deal with China is really a stop-gap measure,\u201d said Sung Won Sohn, a business economist at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. \u201cTrump, facing a tough reelection battle wants to show some progress and China needs to boost its economy. The real hard work is ahead.\u201d\n\nThe GDP report is also expected to show inflation quickening last quarter, though the overall trend likely remained moderate.\n\nBROAD SLOWDOWN\n\nGrowth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, is expected to have decelerated after surging at a 4.6% pace in the second quarter, the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\nDespite the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years, which has buoyed spending, some economists are starting to question the resilience of the consumer after retail sales fell in September for the first time in seven months. Consumer confidence has been trending lower and wage growth is stalling.\n\n\u201cIf consumer spending misses a beat in the fourth quarter, there is little other support for the economy to fall back on,\u201d said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.\n\nBusiness investment likely contracted further after falling by the most in 3-1/2 years in the second quarter. In addition to trade tensions, which have weighed on capital expenditure, cheaper oil has undercut spending on oil and gas drilling.\n\nDesign problems at aerospace giant Boeing (BA.N) have also hurt business investment, with some spillover to exports. The world\u2019s largest planemaker last week reported a 53% drop in quarterly profit because of the grounding of its best-selling 737 MAX jets. The planes were pulled out of service in March following fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.\n\nThe trade deficit probably narrowed relative to the April-June quarter. Economists, however, view the shrinking deficit as masking underlying weakness in the economy.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. trade volume is slowing and slower global growth and U.S. trade policy are likely behind this,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief economist at Barclays in New York.\n\nGapen noted that the drop in trade volume was nearing levels seen during the 2015-16 industrial recession, which he said \u201csuggest the potential for further deceleration in U.S. activity.\u201d Trade subtracted 0.68 percentage point from GDP growth in the second quarter.\n\nBusiness probably accumulated inventory at a measured pace in the last quarter after building stocks at a $69.4 billion rate in the April-June period. Inventories sliced 0.91 percentage point from GDP growth in the second quarter.\n\nThe slower inventory build is also a factor in weak manufacturing production. Government spending is expected to have cooled after rising at its fastest pace in 10 years in the second quarter. Spending on homebuilding likely rebounded after contracting for six straight quarters.", "description": "The U.S. economy likely slowed further in the third quarter, held back by a moderation in consumer spending and declining business investment, which could spur the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again to keep the expansion on course.", "authors": ["Lucia Mutikani", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446397840&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T066", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
