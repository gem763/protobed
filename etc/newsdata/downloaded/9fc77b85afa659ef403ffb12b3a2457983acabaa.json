But even though he only needs 34 Senate Republicans to keep him in office, that outcome is hardly preordained. Far from standing behind him, the Senate is keeping the backdoor unlocked.\n\nThe latest machinations in Congress are designed to create the appearance of staunch partisan support for President Trump. In reality, it indicates the opposite. Senator Lindsey Graham, who has positioned himself as one of Trump\u2019s most debased sycophants, has tried to assemble a show of support. But Graham has only been able to get 44 of the 54 Republicans to sign his resolution. And even mustering that rather tepid showing, reports Jonathan Swan, required negotiating with Mitch McConnell to soften the wording.\n\nThe resolution itself, tellingly, contains no substantive defense of Trump\u2019s behavior whatsoever. It merely complains that the House impeachment has been conducted in secrecy, and urges some procedural changes. Trump should be permitted \u201cto call witnesses on his behalf, and have a basic understanding of the accusations against him that would form any basis for impeachment.\u201d (Of course, if Trump having a \u201cbasic understanding\u201d of the charges is necessary to impeach him, he\u2019s in the clear, since he seems to lack the capacity to understand the offense.) It likewise calls for the House \u201cto vote to initiate a formal impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nTaken literally, Trump\u2019s staunchest defenders are literally asking the House to vote to impeach Trump. That can\u2019t be the defense he wants.\n\nOnce the House is finished with its initial process of collecting testimony, it will move to open hearings and likely hold a formal vote, which will moot all the process complaints. As the New York Times reports, Republicans are \u201ckeenly aware that there is an expiration date on that approach.\u201d The whole purpose of these talking points is to give loyalists a way of not confronting the extremely damning set of facts that has emerged.\n\nIt is notable, as well, that Trump\u2019s Republican critics are focusing on the facts of the case, while his supporters are focusing on Trump\u2019s feelings. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to be a harder choice for more people. Whether that\u2019s enough for enough senators to take decisive action \u2026 every single move has been in the wrong direction for\u201d Trump, a source close to McConnell tells Josh Kraushaar, adding, \u201cThis is shaping up to be a very dark moment for the Trump White House.\u201d Senator John Thune, normally an automatic partisan vote, tells NBC, \u201cThe picture coming out of it based on the reporting we\u2019ve seen is, yeah, I would say is not a good one.\u201d\n\nThe defense of Trump, meanwhile, boils down to acknowledging that he is going through a lot of emotional turmoil. \u201cHe feels like it never stops, that he\u2019s been in office for, what, three years now, and every time he turns around there\u2019s another reason that his family, his friends have to pay legal bills,\u201d Graham tells the Times. \u201cHe keeps telling us he did nothing wrong.\u201d Yes, Trump certainly has committed a lot of crimes.\n\nNational Review editor Rich Lowry warns that, if removed from office, \u201cHe will vent his anger and resentment at every opportunity. It will be \u2018human scum\u2019 every single day.\u201d Well, then, by all means, let\u2019s keep this unstable vessel of resentment in the most powerful office on Earth, and work to extend his term another four years!\n\nLowry\u2019s argument against removal is a solid reason to bet that, at the end of the day, Republicans will not probably risk the party schism that would come if they join together and pull the rip cord on Trump\u2019s shambolic presidency. On the other hand, the fact that Lowry even has to devote a column to arguing against this course of action is evidence that what once seemed like a completely fantastical scenario can no longer be dismissed.", "description": "Senate Republicans are making only lukewarm defenses of President Trump against impeachment in the Ukraine scandal.
