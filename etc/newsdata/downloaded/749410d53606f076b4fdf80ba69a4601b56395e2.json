Prices are flat in London and falling by 0.5 per cent in Oxford.\n\n'There is a continued polarisation in housing market conditions across the country set by underlying market fundamentals, albeit Brexit uncertainty has been a compounding factor for lower market activity in some areas', says Richard Donnell of Zoopla.\n\n'A General Election seems to be a growing possibility ahead of any Brexit resolution; however, once the political outlook becomes clearer, we would expect a modest bounce-back in demand for a six \u2013 12-month period.'\n\nHowever, Donnell stressed that, more than Brexit, it is housing affordability which is really having an impact on sales across southern England.\n\nThe report comes as house price growth has been moderating, remaining below 1 per cent for the 11th month in a row, according to the latest figures by Nationwide.", "description": "Slower house price growth and weaker demand means that the average time to sell a property is now at a three-year high of 12 weeks, up from eight weeks in September 2016, said Zoopla.", "authors": ["Camilla Canocchi For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
