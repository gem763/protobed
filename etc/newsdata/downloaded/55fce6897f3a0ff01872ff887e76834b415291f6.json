Why serving whisky in a capsule is a novelty too far", "language": "en", "text": "The Glenlivet claims it is \u2018redefining how whisky can be enjoyed\u2019 with its edible pods, which are wrapped in seaweed. True whisky lovers will scotch the notion\n\nNever mind whisky fumes \u2013 here is a notion to truly addle your mind: edible cocktail capsules, bearing a remarkable resemblance to those quick-dissolve pods you bung in the dishwasher. Tempted? Nor am I.\n\nThis genius invention comes to us courtesy of the Glenlivet. Its tagline, \u201cOriginal by Tradition\u201d, is nearly as puzzling as its decision to enclose its whisky in a transparent casing (made of seaweed, apparently), to avoid the need for glasses.\n\nI wasn\u2019t aware that glasses were so hard to come by; in fact, lots of whisky brands actually supply them. Johnnie Walker Gold Label gift packs come with two tumblers; last year, the Macallan offered a limited-edition duo engraved to your specifications. Gorgeous art deco whisky glasses are for sale all over the internet, and no seaweed was harmed in their making.\n\n\u201cNo ice. No stirrer. No glass. We\u2019re redefining how whisky can be enjoyed,\u201d the brand tweeted as it launched its Capsule Collection. I\u2019m not convinced it is enjoyment that they are redefining. Warm whisky squirted straight into your mouth, with no time to swirl or sniff, to enjoy colours, aromas and flavours, has as much to do with enjoyment as Willy Wonka\u2019s chewing gum in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory \u2013 or possibly less, since the gum that turned spoilt Violet violet was supposed to contain a three-course meal. Perhaps the Glenlivet\u2019s next set of capsules could incorporate a salty snack and an aspirin in each handy pod.\n\nAnd who is to say that they will be consumed as intended? \u201cGuys, I don\u2019t know how to tell you this,\u201d tweeted one user: \u201cTeens are going to put these in their butts.\u201d It quickly became a running joke on the site. Perhaps the wild-eyed Dr Frankenstein behind these monsters will point out that teens, in the country that says \u201cbutts\u201d (the US is the Glenlivet\u2019s primary market), are forbidden to drink alcohol. To which it is reasonable to respond: who said anything about drinking?\n\nMultinationals such as Pernod Ricard (which owns the Glenlivet) are fixated on novelty, which has nothing to do with the slow enjoyment of good whisky. If we want people to drink responsibly, it isn\u2019t enough to put anodyne health warnings on websites and bottles. What is needed is an education in appreciation, and that doesn\u2019t come in a consumable capsule.", "description": "The Glenlivet claims it is \u2018redefining how whisky can be enjoyed\u2019 with its edible pods, which are wrapped in seaweed.
