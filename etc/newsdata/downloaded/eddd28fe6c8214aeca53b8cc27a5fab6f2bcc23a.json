Narrow staircases from the sleeping quarters and showers led to the galley.\n\nIt remains unclear what started the fire. But Mr. Brown said \u201cyou couldn\u2019t have asked for a worse situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a vessel in the open sea that is in the middle of the night,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sleeping compartment was on the bottom deck of the ship. They would have been sound asleep when this fire started.\u201d\n\nIt was too early on Monday to say whether negligence had played any role in the fire. \u201cThe vessel has been in full compliance,\u201d Capt. Rochester said at a news conference. The boat was equipped with a fire suppression system in the engine room. The vessel also had an onboard, built-in barbecue, according to the website.\n\nAfter picking up the mayday call at about 3:15 a.m., the Coast Guard dispatched two helicopter crews and several boats to the scene, where they were met by partner law enforcement agencies.\n\nAt the time of the fire, the Conception was moored in Platts Harbor, north of Santa Cruz Island. At sunrise it was smoldering but still afloat, according to a photograph posted by the Santa Barbara Fire Department. It sank later that morning, around 20 yards from shore.\n\nThe Hansens\u2019 account testified to the panic in the initial moments after the fire struck.\n\nThe crew members who escaped the fire had reached the couple\u2019s boat on an inflatable tender boat.", "description": "Five crew members were rescued, but the Coast Guard said the passengers were believed to have been asleep below deck.
