There\u2019s another day, another baseball game,\u201d Soto said. \u201cIt\u2019s just business. I\u2019m still happy it\u2019s my birthday, and tomorrow\u2019s another day. We\u2019ll come in, play baseball and try to enjoy.\u201d\n\nBefore the game, former sluggers Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz presented Soto with a cake near home plate prior to batting practice.\n\nThen, Soto was serenaded with \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d by fans in left field while warming up for the second inning. He tipped his cap in return.\n\nThose were the highlights. If he\u2019s lucky, that\u2019s what Soto will remember about his milestone birthday. What he would like to forget is going 0 for 4 with three strikeouts and an error in left field.\n\nHis teammates were not much better. The Nationals stranded 12 and went 0 for 10 with runners in scoring position.\n\n\u201cWe just missed when we needed it,\u201d Soto said.\n\nPlaying in front of a packed crowd at the first World Series game in Washington since 1933, Soto and the Nationals put on a disappointing performance that gradually quieted the crowd and got the fans to pocket their red rally towels.\n\nIn the first inning, Soto hit an infield grounder with two outs and a runner on second. He walked in the third, struck out with a man on in the fifth and struck out again in the seventh.\n\nWorst of all, he made the final out, keeping the bat on his shoulder while looking at a third strike from Roberto Osuna.\n\nHe was also uncharacteristically ineffective on defense. Soto sailed a throw from left field over the catcher trying to get a runner at the plate in the second, and was charged with an error in the third when he fumbled a ball into the corner, allowing Jos\u00e9 Altuve to reach third base on a double.\n\nSoto became the first player to make an error on his birthday in the World Series since Atlanta shortstop Rafael Belliard in 1995.\n\nOnly one player has homered on his birthday in the Series: Willie Aikens for Kansas City in 1980.\n\nBefore the game, someone mentioned that Soto \u2014 now 21 \u2014 would be able to toast himself with champagne. He said yes, he could.\n\nThere was nothing much to celebrate on Friday night. But there\u2019s still a chance Soto can drink and spray plenty of bubbly at the end of the Series, which now is assured of going at least five games.\n\nNo matter how it turns out, it\u2019s been one heck of a year. After batting .282 with 34 homers and 110 RBIs in the regular season, Soto helped the Nationals win the NL wild-card game with a clutch single against Milwaukee.\n\nHe hit a key home run off Clayton Kershaw in the deciding Game 5 of the NL Championship Series victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers and was instrumental in helping the Nationals win the first two games against Houston.\n\nSoto said his talk with Big Papi and A-Rod was productive, hearing advice from players who had already been in these big-game situations.\n\nBorn in the Dominican Republic, Soto said his upbringing made him the person he is today.\n\n\u201cNot just my father. My entire family has been incredible,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Juan Soto found that playing in the World Series on his birthday was no piece of cake.
