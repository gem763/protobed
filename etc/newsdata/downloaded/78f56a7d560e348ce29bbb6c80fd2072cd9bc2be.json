An astronaut is also shown receiving a delivery in space.\n\nMeanwhile a voice-over states: \"Order what you want; where you want; when you want it\" while text at the bottom of the screen reads: \"Some restrictions apply, obviously\u2026\"\n\nThere were 22 complaints from people who, knowing that Deliveroo did not deliver to their areas, said that the ad was misleading.\n\nDeliveroo's parent company, Roofoods, said that the exaggerated scenes in the ad showed it was not meant to represent real life - simply that it was possible to order from Deliveroo in different everyday locations.\n\nIt also said customers could check their app to see whether their area was covered without incurring any cost.\n\nBut the ASA said that without any additional explanation, viewers were likely to take the claim \"Order what you want; where you want; when you want it\" literally.\n\nImage copyright Youtube Image caption A woman is also shown receiving a delivery during a car chase\n\n\"Because we considered the ad suggested delivery was unrestricted throughout the UK when that was not the case, we concluded that it was likely to mislead,\" it said.\n\nThe ad must not appear again in its current form and Roofoods has been told to ensure that similar claims do not appears in its marketing again.\n\nA Deliveroo spokesman said: \"Deliveroo designed a playful advert to show that, through our service, people are able to order food to a wide range of places, whether home or work, for a range of occasions.\n\n\"We know some will be disappointed that their local area isn't currently served by Deliveroo, but we are expanding rapidly across the UK.\"", "description": "The ad implied the food delivery firm could deliver anywhere in the UK at anytime.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15206/production/_108743568_capture1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
