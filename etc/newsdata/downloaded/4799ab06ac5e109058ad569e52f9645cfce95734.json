Egg freezing dates back to 1986 when the first pregnancy from a frozen egg was reported in the Lancet Journal. Collected eggs were preserved in cryogenic tanks after being frozen 'slowly' for many years. In the early 2000s, scientists began experimenting with an 'ultra-rapid' freezing technique called vitrification. Using this process, the temperature of an egg plummets thousands of degrees per minute, resulting in a glass-like cell structure that is stronger than other crystalline ice forms. They are then stored in cryogenic tanks, for up to 25 years. In preparation for having her eggs retrieved, a woman must undergo the first stage of an IVF cycle, which uses hormones to stimulate more eggs into maturity, then another set of hormones to trigger the eggs' release. Patients inject these drugs at home and are usually closely monitored by their doctors. There are many different forms of these hormone treatments, ranging in cost from about $800 (\u00a3625) to $6,000 (\u00a34,675) per cycle, and six to 10 weeks in duration. Then, the eggs are surgically retrieved in a minimally-invasive procedure.\n\nWomen who are prematurely infertile, for example experiencing an early menopause, can store their eggs for 55 years under the same laws.\n\nPET says women deciding if they should freeze their eggs, which costs around \u00a35,000 in the UK, must weigh up a complex set of odds.\n\nThe success rate for conceiving is higher the younger you are when you freeze eggs, and so experts recommend doing so before the age of 35.\n\nHowever, women who freeze their eggs in their 20s are more likely to conceive naturally, making it a waste of money.\n\nFor example, if a woman was to freeze her eggs at 25, the eggs would be destroyed at the age of 35, before she has possibly considered having a family.\n\nShe may also find out she is infertile at the age of 37, and at this point be advised to use donor eggs at another cost.\n\nBut if a woman was to wait and freeze her eggs at the age of 35, her fertility would already be in decline, making the process possibly less successful.\n\nUK fertility regulator the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said the 'time might be right' to look at changing the current law.\n\nFigures show there were more than 1,400 fertility cycles using frozen eggs in 2017 \u2013 almost seven times higher than the 234 in 2010.\n\nFrozen eggs are stored in tanks of liquid nitrogen as soon as they are collected, and are thawed when they are needed.\n\nSharon Jones, who decided to freeze her eggs more than a year ago, said there is 'really no need' for the 10-year limit.\n\nShe told the BBC: 'The longer you wait, the longer you give yourself to meet someone. But the earlier you do it, the more likely the eggs are to be viable.'\n\nThe 35-year-old HR manager said she was left with a 'real conundrum' when making the decision to freeze her eggs, which has cost her \u00a35,000.", "description": "Women's eggs can be frozen for a long time with latest technology - but current laws in the UK say they should be destroyed after a decade for women who are not prematurely infertile.", "authors": ["Stephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/09/20271578-0-image-a-3_1572253702101.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
