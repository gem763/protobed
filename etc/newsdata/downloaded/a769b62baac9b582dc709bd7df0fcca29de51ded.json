REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party said on Thursday it could not support the Brexit deal being proposed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the European Union.\n\n\u201cAs things stand, we could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues and there is a lack of clarity on VAT,\u201d DUP leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work with the Government to try and get a sensible deal that works for Northern Ireland and protects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nThe support of the DUP, which backs Johnson\u2019s government, is crucial as some hardline Brexiteers in his party say they will be swayed by its stance on the most difficult part of any agreement - the Irish border riddle.\n\nJohnson, who has no majority in the 650-seat parliament, needs 320 votes to get a deal ratified. The DUP have 10 votes.\n\nSterling slid as much as 0.6% to $1.2748, and also declined 0.5% versus the euro to as low as 86.81 pence, before steadying and recouping some of those losses.", "description": "Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party said on Thursday it could not support the Brexit deal being proposed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the European Union.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441759127&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0DQ", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
