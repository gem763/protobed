People on the eastern side of the fire and in neighbouring Lake County also were given evacuation warnings to be prepared to leave because of changing winds.\n\nThe flames didn't discriminate. In wine country, farm-workers who toil in the vineyards were among those displaced. In Los Angeles, James and former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger were driven from their homes.\n\n\"Man these LA [fires] are no joke,\" the Los Angeles Lakers star tweeted, using an emoji for the word \"fires\". \"Crazy night.\"\n\nThe Hollywood premiere of Schwarzenegger's Terminator: Dark Fate was cancelled on Monday night (local time).\n\nOthers who own homes in the evacuation zone include Senator Kamala Harris, a Democrat running for president, who was not home at the time; Walt Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger; and rapper and producer Dr Dre.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnxious residents made their way down steep hillsides in the middle of the night in Range Rovers, Teslas and Maseratis. They left behind homes decorated for Halloween - skeletons hanging from homes, goblins sitting on front steps, cobwebs draped over bushes - as a plume of smoke glowed like a giant pumpkin.\n\nDavid Boyle, 78, awoke at 3 am to his doorbell ringing and police officers pounding on the front door. They warned him the wildfire was advancing toward his house near the Getty complex.\n\n\"They said, 'You need to evacuate.' I'm like, 'When?' They said, 'Now',\" Doyle said.\n\nTens of thousands of people were ordered to clear out as the fire spread to more than 600 acres and burned at least five homes, authorities said.\n\nThe evacuation area extended west into Pacific Palisades, encompassing some of the most exclusive real estate in California, where celebrities and wealthy professionals live in estates nestled in canyons or on ridgetop retreats that cost tens of millions of dollars but are surrounded by tinder-dry vegetation.\n\nThe Getty, with its collection of priceless art, was not threatened, fire officials said. The museum gave assurances that its artworks were protected by state-of-the-art technology.\n\nIn northern California, some 40 school districts in Sonoma County cancelled classes, as did the University of California, Berkeley, which had no power because of the outages.\n\nWith no rain and more wind in the forecast, the coming days could be grim.\n\nAAP", "description": "A wildfire swept through the star-studded hills of Los Angeles, destroying several large homes and forcing LeBron James and thousands of others to flee.
