Also of note, the umpire referenced for the game was Jeff Rice.\n\n(On the helmet-to-helmet contact with Tracy Walker, it appeared he was going for the ball. Does the defensive back have the right to go for the ball? Does that offset any incidental helmet-to-helmet contact?)\n\nBlakeman: \u201cThat\u2019s a good question, but the reality is, it is a strict liability for a defensive player. In this case, he may be going for the ball and not intending to hit the helmet, but when there\u2019s helmet contact, it is a foul in that situation.\u201d\n\n(Even if he had come up with the interception, that doesn\u2019t change the ruling in any way?)\n\nBlakeman: \u201cEven if he did impact the helmet and then intercepted the ball, it would still have been a foul.\u201d\n\n(On the two hands-to-the-face penalties on Detroit defensive end Trey Flowers. I don\u2019t know if you were the one who actually threw the flag there, but when discussing with the crew, what did you guys see on those calls?\n\nStory continues\n\nBlakeman: \u201cThe umpire threw both of them. The last one was really the only one I\u2019ve discussed with him. Basically, it\u2019s for illegal use of the hands, hands-to-the-face foul. To be a foul, we basically need some forceful contact that\u2019s prolonged to the head and neck area of the defender, So, in his mind he had pinned him back, it was prolonged, and that\u2019s what created the foul.\u201d\n\n(You said head or neck area?)\n\nBlakeman: \u201cHead or neck area, yes.\u201d\n\nWalker was not attempting to level a hit on Allison. Instead, he was obviously trying to intercept a pass from Aaron Rodgers that been thrown in front of Allison.\n\nFlowers\u2019 two illegal hands to the face penalties came on third downs that enabled the Packers to score a touchdown to close the gap to 22-20 with nine minutes remaining and the game-winning field goal as time expired.", "description": "The head referee is available to a lone pool reporter after each NFL game if there are questions about the application of the rules in a given contest.
