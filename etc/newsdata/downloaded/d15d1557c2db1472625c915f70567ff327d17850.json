Our friendship and our daughter is priority.\"\n\nSince then, rumours had flown about their break-up, with many fans willing them to get back together for the sake of their little girl.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Getty Images for The Met Museum/)\n\nBut insiders are insisting the split is a permanent one, as Kylie and Scott want completely different things in life.\n\n\"Kylie and Travis are still not back together,\" one source told Us Weekly.\n\n\"It doesn't look like they will immediately reconcile anymore. They have differing objectives and two different lives.\"\n\nAnother insider revealed the most contentious issue between the exes was whether or not to have a second child, with Kylie reportedly pushing to expand their family.\n\n(Image: Getty Images for Netflix)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"There were several issues that made them decide to take a break,\" said People magazine's mole. \"Kylie is all about family life and really wants a second baby.\"\n\nThere were also issues with trust, after Kylie dumped Travis briefly in February this year after finding suspicious DMs on his phone, prompting fears he had cheated on her.\n\n\"She still has trust issues with Travis. He hasn't been giving her the commitment that she needs,\" the source added.\n\n\"Travis isn't ready to give her all that she wants.\"\n\n(Image: FilmMagic)\n\nAt the time of their split, Travis was linked to Instagram model YungSweetRo , who he has known as a friend since November 2013.\n\nBut the model branded the rumours \"lies\" and begged her fans to stop sharing them.\n\n\"None of these rumors are true. It's just the internet creating a false narrative,\" she wrote on her Instagram Story.\n\n\"Please stop spreading lies and leave him, her & I alone because it's affecting our real lives.
