The World Cup season opens Nov. 29 in Park City, Utah.\n\nHumphries could be wearing the stars and stripes at Canada's World Cup stop Dec. 13-14 in Whistler, B.C.\n\n\"It has been my pleasure and the greatest honour of my life to represent you on the world's stage wearing the Maple Leaf,\" Humphries said in her statement.\n\n\"No words can adequately describe what is going through my head and my heart.\"\n\nThe pilot and brakewoman Heather Moyse won back-to-back gold in 2010 and 2014 making them the first women to repeat as Olympic champions.\n\nThe duo carried Canada's flag at the 2014 closing ceremonies.\n\nStrained relationship\n\nHow did it get to the point where one of Canada's most decorated Olympians wanted out and was willing to go to court to leave?\n\nMere months after winning an Olympic bronze medal with Phylicia George at the 2018 Winter Games, Humphries filed a harassment complaint Aug. 22 alleging the head coach verbally and mentally abused her and accusing BCS management of mishandling her concerns in violation of the organization's own policies.\n\nBCS handed the complaint to a third-party company that specializes in investigating such matters.\n\nHill Advisory Services concluded in its report made public earlier this month that \"in the investigator's opinion there has been no breach to relevant policy.\"\n\nHumphries did not compete for Canada in 2018-19. She submitted a list of conditions in May under which she would return to the national team.\n\nThe list included a new coach and her own high-performance director, coverage of a suite of travel, training and competition costs, no direct contact with BCS management and backpay of Sport Canada Athletes Assistance money for the 2018-19 season, which amounted to $21,180.\n\nBCS countered its policy is not to negotiate with individual athletes on conditions for them to compete for Canada.\n\nHumphries asked for her release Aug. 3.\n\nBCS said it would defer a decision until after the independent review of her harassment complaint was complete.\n\nWith a deadline looming, Humphries took BCS to court to force the issue with a multi-million-dollar lawsuit \u2014 which she said Sunday she will drop \u2014 and a request for an injunction forcing her release.\n\nA Calgary judge turned down Humphries' request for an injunction Sept. 17, stating there were sports tribunals better equipped to handle the dispute.\n\nBCS high-performance director Chris Le Bihan stated at the courthouse the organization still wanted Humphries on the national team, but it seemed the relationship had devolved past the point of no return.\n\nHumphries took her case to the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada (SDRCC) that offers mediation and arbitration services for sport organizations that receive federal funding.\n\nBut before an arbitrator made a ruling, BCS decided to cut ties with Humphries.\n\nAs to whether the culture around the national team was \"unsafe\" as Humphries said, or this was a case of a personality clash, people with knowledge of the situation were reluctant to comment publicly because their livelihoods are still tied to the sport and its athletes.\n\nThe Canadian Press heard divergent opinions from people who gave them on the condition they not be identified. Humphries' claims were both confirmed and refuted.\n\nCanadians athletes have competed for other countries before, but the emotional breach between Humphries and the organization that has overseen her career for a decade and a half is confounding.\n\n\"To all of those that are upset with me, I'm asking only that you try to understand how difficult this has been and I would have loved to continue to compete for Canada,\" Humphries said.", "description": "Athlete\u00a0Kaillie Humphries wrote an open letter to Canada on Sunday, calling the series of events that ultimately led to the Canadian bobsleigh team giving her the release she sought in order to compete for the United States \"the most difficult process\" of her life.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5302144.1569787469!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bob-calgary-stampede-marshal-20150603.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
