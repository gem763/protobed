Western Digital said it is combining its nine-disk mechanical platform and energy assisted recording to meet data center requirements of customers like Dropbox.\n\nFlash storage: A guide for IT pros | High-end storage for enterprise, small business, and home users\n\nWestern Digital previewed the 20TB SMR (Shingled Magnetic Recording) drive in June. The storage giant is betting that SMR drives will represent half of its HDD exabytes shipped by 2023. SMR drives are expected to offer cost savings over PMR (Perpendicular Magnetic Recording) drives. For the last year, Western Digital has been working to make SMR performance equal to PMR drives.\n\nThe drives that are being sampled will join Western Digital's portfolio of HDDs ranging from 10TB to 14TB to 18TB to 20TB drives in various configurations. Those HDDs and capacities come in six-, eight- and nine-disk platforms.\n\nMore storage:", "description": "The company's 18TB CMR Ultrastar DC HC550 and 20TB Ultrastar DC HC650 SMR hard disk drives are designed to give hyperscale data centers more density and total cost of ownership to handle exabytes.", "authors": ["Larry Dignan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/02/2bb88ad8-d438-46a8-ab78-0e9fcbf82577/thumbnail/770x578/acd0447755f58c4eb90568dd104621e0/wdc-ulrastar-20tb.png"}
