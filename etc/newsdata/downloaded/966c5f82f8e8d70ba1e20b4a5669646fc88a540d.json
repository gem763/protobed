You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal.\u201d\n\nDays after millions of young people took to the streets worldwide to demand emergency action on climate change, leaders gathered for the annual United Nations general assembly aiming to inject fresh momentum into efforts to curb carbon emissions.\n\nBut Thunberg predicted the summit would not deliver any new plans in line with the radical cuts in greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say are needed to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown. \u201cThe eyes of all future generations are upon you,\u201d a visibly emotional Thunberg said. \u201cAnd if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line.\u201d\n\nAs the summit spooled through about 60 speeches from national representatives, it became clear that Thunberg\u2019s forecast was prescient. Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, told delegates that \u201cthe time for talking is over\u201d in announcing a plan to ramp up renewable energy but didn\u2019t announce any phase-out of coal \u2013 a key goal set by Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general who convened the summit.\n\nAngela Merkel, the German chancellor, did set out the end of coalmining in her country but only by 2038 \u2013 a lengthy timeframe that disappointed environmentalists.\n\nMeanwhile, China declined to put forward any new measures to tackle the climate crisis.\n\nEmmanuel Macron, the French president, called for the European Union to deepen its emissions cuts and said that France would not make trade deals with countries not signed up tor the landmark Paris climate agreement. \u201cWe cannot allow our youth to strike every Friday without action,\u201d Macron said, in reference to Friday\u2019s global climate strikes.\n\nDespite Guterres\u2019 efforts, the summit was somewhat overshadowed by its absentees \u2013 most notably the US, and Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil, whose representatives were reportedly not selected to make a presentation there because of Brazil\u2019s failure to outline plans to strengthen its efforts to counter climate change.\n\nDonald Trump did visit the UN on Monday but only briefly dipped into the climate summit to see Modi\u2019s speech before attending a meeting which he had called on religious freedom.\n\nAs he arrived at the UN, Trump crossed paths with Thunberg, who fixed the president with a hard stare.\n\nPlay Video 0:18 Greta Thunberg sees Trump as he arrives for UN climate action summit - video\n\nThe summit was designed to accelerate countries\u2019 ambition to address the climate crisis amid increasingly urgent warnings by scientists. A new UN analysis has found that commitments to cut planet-warming gases must be at least tripled and increased by up to fivefold if the world is to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement of holding the temperature rise to at least 2C above the pre-industrial era.\n\nThe world is currently on track to warm by as much as 3.4C by the end of the century, the UN warned, a situation that would escalate disastrous heatwaves, flooding, droughts and societal unrest. Major coral reefs and many other species face extinction.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big dissonance between every leader saying to Greta \u2018we hear you\u2019 and the commitments they are putting on to the table,\u201d said Isabel Cavelier, a former climate negotiator for Colombia who is now senior adviser at the Mission 2020 climate group. \u201cChina said absolutely nothing new, India mentioned commitments made in the past, the US, Canada and Australia aren\u2019t here. We are seeing governments showing up empty-handed. There\u2019s a feeling that the big emitters are holding things back.\u201d\n\nThere were a few signs of progress. A group of nearly 90 large companies promised to reach net zero emissions by 2050, while a handful of countries said they will be winding down coal use. But it became apparent that most of the ambition was coming from developing countries, rather than the major polluters.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Thunberg speaks at the summit. Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThunberg\u2019s speech was \u201cvery emotional and grounded in science\u201d, said Alden Meyer, director of strategy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cIf I were a world leader I\u2019d feel very uncomfortable. But we\u2019ve seen nothing from the big national leaders, the G20 players. It\u2019s hard to say the summit moved the needle on the emissions curve.\u201d\n\n\u201cOther countries must follow our lead,\u201d said Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands, a country situated on coral atolls in the Pacific that is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise. \u201cFalling short will represent the greatest failure humanity has ever seen. The summit must be the moment we choose survival over selfishness.\u201d\n\nIn his opening remarks, Guterres tried to capture the urgency of climate change and called out the fossil fuel industry.\n\n\u201cNature is angry. And we fool ourselves if we think we can fool nature, because nature always strikes back, and around the world nature is striking back with fury,\u201d Guterres said.\n\n\u201cThere is a cost to everything. But the biggest cost is doing nothing. The biggest cost is subsidising a dying fossil fuel industry, building more and more coal plants, and denying what is plain as day: that we are in a deep climate hole, and to get out we must first stop digging,\u201d he said.\n\n'Save us, save the world': Pacific climate warriors taking the fight to the UN Read more\n\nOver the past year, Guterres has called for no new coal plants to be built after 2020, urged a phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies and asked countries to map out how to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nWhile some countries have made progress, some of the biggest-emitting countries remain far behind, even as wildfires, heatwaves and record temperatures have provided glimpses of the devastation that could lie in store in a warmer world.\n\nPope Francis, in a message broadcast to the conference, called for honesty, responsibility and courage to face \u201cone of the most serious and worrying phenomena of our time\u201c.", "description": "Thunberg, 16, says governments have betrayed young people by their climate crisis failure: \u2018You are still not mature enough to tell it like it is\u2019", "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90343c734a633b9b66732dfe1f532e36a8a40e46/0_131_3200_1921/master/3200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1defa7f674efbc2dc6433a970e7eee25", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
