Beyond the White House\u2019s initial opposition statement to the bill back in May, however, Democrats\u2019 demands have been largely ignored.\n\nBut when Swift called out the Trump administration at the MTV Video Music Awards last Monday night, accepting the award for Video of the Year for her queer anthem, \u201cYou Need To Calm Down,\u201d and asking the White House to respond to a petition she\u2019d promoted supporting the Equality Act, the response came less than 24 hours later.\n\nThe White House\u2019s gay deputy press secretary, Judd Deere, repeated the Trump administration line that it \u201csupports equal treatment for all\u201d but doesn\u2019t support this bill because of \u201cpoison pills\u201d\u2014a bogus argument meant to cover up President Donald Trump\u2019s bowing to religious extremists and their desire to discriminate based on their religious beliefs.\n\nOn Fox News, Kellyanne Conway tried to make light of Swift's clarion call by literally singing the lyrics to Swift\u2019s song, while Fox And Friends\u2014which has acted as an arm of the administration\u2014brought on a guest who mocked Swift.\n\nEven anti-LGBTQ evangelical leader and loyal Trump supporter Franklin Graham clearly felt he had to go into high dudgeon, accusing Swift of promoting,\u201cthe most crushing threat to religious liberty in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nThe immediate reactions were for good reason. The 29-year-old pop phenomenon who has sold more than 50 million albums has a massive fan base among a young demographic nationally\u2014people who follow her lead. When Swift broke her silence on partisan politics and endorsed Democrats in 2018 in a post to her more than 112 million Instagram followers, a surge in voter registrations followed, enough to scare any seasoned GOP strategist.\n\nMadonna, Lady Gaga and other recording artists and Hollywood figures have of course championed LGBTQ civil rights too\u2014long before Swift\u2014and have certainly influenced millions of Americans on the issue.\n\nBut unlike most of them, Swift didn\u2019t rise up from an urban or counterculture music scene, which can be too easily marginalized by GOP politicians and voters. Rather she emerged out of red state America, within a comparatively traditional conservative music world.\n\nBorn in Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville with her family as a teen. By the time Swift was 20 years old she became a country music sensation. Soon enough she had crossover hits that brought international stardom, widened her audience astronomically and helped her gain enormous influence.\n\nWhen Swift spoke out against Republican candidates in 2018, Trump\u2019s response revealed Swift\u2019s superpowers. Just about every well-known woman who crosses Trump, after all, is vilified by him in misogynistic tirades.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s only response to Swift was that he would \u201clike Taylor\u2019s music about 25% less now.\u201d\n\nFor Trump, that was about as respectful\u2014and careful\u2014as you get. Sen. Corey Booker, Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic presidential candidates signed Swift\u2019s petition to the White House on the Equality Act earlier this summer, acknowledging her power and might, following her lead rather than the other way around.\n\nSome inside and outside the LGBTQ community have questioned the sincerity of Swift's advocacy, raising concerns that she\u2019s profiting from it or, in the case of the \u201cCalm Down\u201d video, which is filled with queer icons and rainbow flags, engaging in appropriation. That has often been claimed about Madonna, Gaga and others too.\n\n\u201c When the White House must continually repeat that it supports \u2018equal treatment for all\u2019 but that the Equality Act has \u2018poison pills\u2019 that \u2019undermine parental and conscience rights,\u2019 it draws the ridiculousness of the argument\u2014and its political calculus\u2014out into the open \u201d\n\nWhatever the case, Swift is also giving major heartburn to the enemies of equality. It\u2019s true that embracing celebrities as leaders on causes can be a double-edged sword\u2014we have only to look to Jussie Smollett on that, after all\u2014and activists should be wary and know when to create distance. But when someone is giving you an enormous platform, you don\u2019t turn it down.\n\nAnd in this case that platform extends right into the GOP and the voters Trump covets. When the White House must continually repeat that it supports \u201cequal treatment for all\u201d but that the Equality Act has \u201cpoison pills\u201d that \u201cundermine parental and conscience rights,\u201d it draws the ridiculousness of the argument\u2014and its political calculus\u2014out into the open.\n\nThe Trump campaign\u2019s goal is to appease suburban straight voters who are repelled by blatant bigotry\u2014and that includes many that are part of the huge Swift fan base\u2014while not deviating from evangelical leaders demands. As Swift herself said in an open letter back in June, however, you can\u2019t claim to support equality while supporting discrimination.\n\nShe articulates that point repeatedly and loudly\u2014enough to make them jumpy in the White House and on the religious right. That\u2019s why, for them, perhaps more than anyone else on the issue, Swift represents a clear and present danger.", "description": "When Taylor Swift called out the Trump administration over the Equality Act at MTV\u2019s Video Music Awards, the president\u2019s supporters returned fire\u2014revealing how much they fear her.", "authors": ["Michelangelo Signorile"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567193702/190830-signorile-trump-taylor-swift-tease_qpup0h"}
