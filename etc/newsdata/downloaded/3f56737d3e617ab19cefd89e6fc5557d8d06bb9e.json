In four more years\u2019 time, who knows what levels they could reach.\n\nWorld Cup semi-finals England v New Zealand (26 Oct) Wales vs South Africa (27 Oct)", "description": "Makazole Mapimpi scored twice as South Africa ended Japan's run in the Rugby World Cup with a 26-3 victory in their quarter-final clash.", "authors": ["James Gray"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1166237970_1571574988.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
