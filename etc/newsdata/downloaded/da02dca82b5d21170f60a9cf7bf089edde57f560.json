The woman who lost her eminently winnable 2016 presidential election traveled all the way to Venice, Italy to sit behind a replica of the Oval Office desk for an hour \u2026 and leaf through printouts of e-mails from the secret server that almost resulted in her prosecution.\n\nIt\u2019s moves like this that are making political satire obsolete (via Twitchy):\n\nHillary Clinton leafs through her emails for nearly an hour at resolute desk in art exhibits https://t.co/OYwn6MNMgL pic.twitter.com/UZw1hhIqSf \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) September 11, 2019\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spent nearly an hour leafing through some of her emails on display at an art exhibit in Italy. In photos surfacing online, the former Democratic presidential nominee could be seen looking through stacks of some of her past emails, which came under scrutiny during the presidential campaign in 2016. More than 60,000 pages of emails were printed out and assembled in large stacks on a mock presidential resolute desk for the exhibit, which was held at the Venetian Teatro Italia in Venice. The exhibit, titled \u201cHILLARY: The Hillary Clinton Emails,\u201d was created by artist Kenneth Goldsmith. Francesco Urbano Ragazzi, who curated the show, said in a statement that Clinton visited the former movie theater for the exhibit Tuesday. Urbano Ragazzi said that Clinton sat down the exact replica of the resolute desk in the Oval Office, where she spent roughly an hour looking through her emails.\n\nWell \u2026 the e-mails she and her legal team didn\u2019t delete, that is. Let\u2019s not forget that the FBI and the State Department only got about half of the e-mails that went through the server, thanks to Clinton\u2019s own \u201ccuration.\u201d Clinton apparently wanted to amplify the artist\u2019s message that the e-mails were \u201cboring,\u201d as she reportedly put it, but her culling of the e-mails made sure of that.\n\nPresumably, the printouts didn\u2019t contain the e-mails with classified information that the FBI found, too. That might have made them a little less \u201cboring.\u201d\n\nHowever, the photo op itself is finger-kiss perfect \u2026 if Clinton and her team want to remind everyone just how obsessed she is with the Oval Office. She traveled halfway around the world to sit behind a replica of the Resolute Desk and read her own e-mails, or some of them, anyway. Then she sat for pictures behind the desk, mimicking a presidential pose, knowing they would go global. Look what you\u2019re missing is what the effort screams out, when what it really reveals is Hillary\u2019s self-absorption.\n\nThe Daily Wire asks an easily answered question:\n\nWhat stage of grief is this? https://t.co/9ZULRyuEwJ \u2014 The Daily Wire (@realDailyWire) September 12, 2019\n\nDenial, my friends, denial. And maybe bargaining, because at this point it\u2019s tough to believe that Hillary Clinton won\u2019t give one more try at running for president \u2014 not if she travels halfway around the world to indulge in this performance art. It\u2019s worse than Jan Brady at the coffee shop.
