It is the second international series filmed outside America, but the first to be fronted by host RuPaul or long-serving judge Michelle Visage \u2013 who is currently mastering the rumba on Strictly Come Dancing.\n\nRecently renewed for its 12th US season, with four All Stars seasons along the way, RuPaul\u2019s franchise now has a lasting legacy: catapulting drag into the mainstream. It is understandable, though, that die-hard fans of the show would feel nervous at the prospect of Drag Race sissying that walk across the Atlantic. Can the BBC meet their high expectations?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nConsidering one of RuPaul\u2019s mantras is \u201cdon\u2019t f*** it up\u201d, it seems that the BBC have listened carefully. Drag Race UK\u2019s premiere is a triumph that captures the \u201ccharisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent\u201d which made the franchise a worldwide phenomenon. Immediately, the familiar presence of RuPaul and Visage (a self-confessed \u201cBritish culture addict\u201d) puts us at ease. Fellow judge Alan Carr joins them alongside guest judge Andrew Garfield, with the show replicating the structure and hyper-saturated aesthetic of its US counterpart.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Best comedy shows on Netflix 1/10 Elder Millenial, Iliza Shlesinger If you didn\u2019t think you could possibly laugh at more joke about the trials of womanhood, think again. New York native Iliza Shlesinger brings a fresh take on topics from modern dating to wedding planning headaches. Her show is a delightful mix of reality checks and insightful takes. Standout line: \u201cThere\u2019s no secret [to meeting your future spouse], just so we\u2019re clear. Don\u2019t buy the books, don\u2019t buy the hype. There\u2019s no secret, OK? I\u2019m gonna be 35 when I get married. If there was a secret, I would have f****** used it. There\u2019s no secret. There\u2019s no special magic to it. I\u2019m never going to be like, \u2018GATHER ROUND, LADIES! Off the 405, lies a toad hole. You must go to it.\u2019\u201d Netflix 2/10 Nanette, Hannah Gadsby In 2018, Nanette pushed the boundaries of the stand-up special \u2013 and indeed it\u2019s so, so much more than a comedy show. In a little more than an hour, Hannah Gadsby deconstructs the makings of a good joke, explains why she\u2019s done with self-deprecation, and delivers an unforgettable, incredibly powerful take on the trauma she\u2019s experienced as a lesbian in Tasmania. Standout line: \u201cI have built a career out of self-deprecating humour and I don\u2019t want to do that anymore. Do you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It\u2019s not humility, it's humiliation. I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak, and I simply will not do that anymore. Not to myself or anybody who identifies with me.\u201d Netflix 3/10 Hard Knock Wife, Ali Wong If you liked Ali Wong in Always Be My Maybe (which she co-wrote!), then you\u2019re going to love her in Hard Knock Wife (her second Netflix special and a follow-up on her 2016 debut Baby Cobra). Her unapologetic takes on motherhood and marriage (did you know she makes a lot more money than her husband and she\u2019s not sorry?) are gold. Standout line: \u201cNow, I make a lot more money than my husband by, like, a long shot. My mom is very concerned that he\u2019s going to leave me out of intimidation. I had to explain to her that the only kind of man who would leave a woman who makes more money\u2026 is the kind of man that doesn\u2019t like free money.\u201d Netflix 4/10 Relatable, Ellen DeGeneres After 15 years of not doing stand-up, the comedian and talk show icon returned to the stage \u2013 and, of course, turned the experience into a Netflix special. Under the pretence of pondering whether she\u2019s still relatable, Ellen DeGeneres basks in the (well-earned) glory her accomplishments, reflects on her personal experiences \u2013 including her 1997 coming-out and how it was received in Hollywood \u2013 and riffs on the absurdities of daily life. What a treat. Standout line: [On losing her sitcom, then struggling to sell a talk-show to TV executives after coming out as a lesbian:] \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t want to buy it, because no one thought they\u2019d watch. There was this one station manager that said, and this is a quote: \u2018No one\u2019s going to watch it. No one\u2019s going to watch a lesbian during the day.\u2019 And I said \u2018Well, they weren\u2019t watching me at night. What time of day is good for a lesbian?\u2019\u201d Netflix 5/10 Son of Patricia, Trevor Noah Trevor Noah has been starring in comedy specials for a decade, so it\u2019s no surprise that he can take just about any topic (tourism in Bali, trap music, a conversation with President Barack Obama) and turn it into incisive jokes. Standout Line: [Having established Americans\u2019 love for tacos]: \u201cWe\u2019re living through a time when we are all learning about the presidency at the same time as the president. That\u2019s never happened. How wild is that concept? You wake up every day reading the news, and you\u2019re like \u2018Wow, I didn\u2019t know that.\u2019 And somewhere, at that exact same moment, he\u2019s reading the same news, going, \u2018Wow, me too.\u2019\" Netflix 6/10 Glitter Room, Katherine Ryan Katherine Ryan\u2019s second Netflix special (the follow-up to In Trouble, which came out in 2017) tackles some of her trademark topics, from dating to co-parenting, in a lighthearted, self-affirming way. A delight through and through. Standout line: [About a romantic partner:] \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, I need to be with someone who makes me a priority. And I suppose, because you have a child, I will never be your first priority. I shall always be second.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Hah! Second? Oh\u2026 no.\u2019\u201d Netflix 7/10 Weirdo, Donald Glover Back in 2012, Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, was appearing as the unforgettable Troy Barnes in Community \u2013 and spared a little time to record a Netflix special, which remains available to this day. Throughout this one-hour show, he shows off his range, reflecting on his music career, reaching his late twenties, and that brief time when the internet really wanted him to play Spider-Man. Standout line: \u201cI lived in Downtown LA, and Downtown LA is kind of like the Eighties decided to stay there. They\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, OK, you guys go ahead and be the Nineties. Go enjoy Ace of Base \u2013 we\u2019ll be here practicing the Moonwalk and selling crack.\u2019\u201d Comedy Central / Netflix 8/10 Not Normal, Wanda Sykes There\u2019s perhaps one person on Earth who can make the Mueller report genuinely funny \u2013 and that person is Wanda Sykes. The comedian might be best known for her roles on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Black-ish, but her stand-up is well worth a watch. She has impeccable timing, sharp writing, and an apparently effortless ability to connect with her crowd. Standout line: \u201cIn the Mueller investigation, how does [Trump] not know that he\u2019s Individual Number one? Come on. Everybody who\u2019s been indicted or going to jail\u2026 Papadopoulos, Gates, Flynn, Manafort\u2026 It all says in the Mueller report that they co-conspired with Individual Number One. Motherf*****, that\u2019s you! If everybody you come in direct contact with gets herpes, wouldn\u2019t you be like, [confused face] \u2018Am I giving everybody herpes?\u2019\u201d Netflix 9/10 Growing, Amy Schumer Amy Schumer was expecting when her special was released on March 2019, so it\u2019s no surprise she discussed pregnancy \u2013 and the overall business of existing in a female body \u2013 with her trademark honesty for a large part of her show. Standout line: \u201cIt\u2019s a new invention called THINX. They\u2019re just this underwear that you just bleed into [during your period]. Which I guess\u2026 makes me a f****** inventor. Who knew? Should I go on Shark Tank?\u201d Netflix 10/10 Live Shows, Daniel Sloss This special is actually made up of two shows, Dark and Jigsaw. The Scottish comedian refreshes the \u201cfish out of water\u201d archetype by delivering his take on the US \u2013 and that time he told a joke about being an atheist in Indiana. His smart writing enables him to tackle topics, such as disability and \u2013 yes \u2013 paedophilia, in a way few comics could pull off. Standout line: \u201cAs a parent \u2013 no, I\u2019m not a parent, but I like speaking for other people, because I\u2019m white, middle-class and male, and that\u2019s what my people do.\u201d Netflix 1/10 Elder Millenial, Iliza Shlesinger If you didn\u2019t think you could possibly laugh at more joke about the trials of womanhood, think again.

Whether it\u2019s a look to master, a group performance or a comedy routine, the losing queen is given her marching orders by Ru and told to \u201csashay away\u201d (though not before lip-syncing for her life, of course). Yet what makes the Drag Race UK\u2019s first episode so promising is that it completely nails the brief of a UK rebrand: to blend a successful US format with British cultural references.\n\nDuring the premiere, we see drag incarnations of Dead or Alive frontman Pete Burns and Amy Winehouse. There are also references to Coronation Street and even queen of clean (and memes) Kim Woodburn. And what could be more British than a drag queen called Cheryl Hole dressed up as 93-year-old Queen Elizabeth II?\n\nWhat makes Drag Race special, beyond the outrageous costumes, shady reads and irreverent one-liners, is the contestants. The show features queens of different ages from across the UK (excluding Scotland, which is a shame). We hear their fascinating stories, which started in places like Belfast, Leicester and West Bromwich, eventually drawing them towards drag. Sum Ting Wong says that her drag name is a \u201creclamation\u201d of the racist names she used to be called as a child growing up in Birmingham. Divina Di Campo talks about her two decades of hustling up and down the UK on the drag scene, long before drag became mainstream.\n\nAt the beginning of the episode, RuPaul proclaims that Drag Race UK represents the \u201crich past and vibrant future of drag in the UK\u201d. In the sanctuary of the workroom, we see friendships starting to blossom over conversations that cut across generational and geographical divides. With drag and the wider queer community still navigating its place between \u201cold\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d, this is when Drag Race is at its most powerful.\n\nUltimately, Drag Race is a parody of reality shows like America\u2019s Next Top Model, which dominated the previous TV era. Drag Race UK captures this campy subversion perfectly, breathing new life into a franchise which (\u201cjust between us girls\u201d) was beginning to look overly polished and fatigued. The UK series tells us that the magic of the first six seasons of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race \u2013 where contestants weren\u2019t hyper-aware that global fame and social media stardom awaited them \u2013 can be RuCaptured.\n\nGentlemen, start your engines, and may the best woman win.", "description": "\u201cMinging.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a chav.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a right trollop.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m unique as f***, mate.\u201d These are all British-isms that I never thought I\u2019d hear during an episode of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, but the premiere of BBC3's UK version has changed the pioneering franchise forever.", "authors": ["Louis Staples"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/16/18844894-low-res-ru-pauls-drag-race-uk.jpg"}
