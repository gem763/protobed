The two are pictured together in May 2012\n\nShe says she went to police after a \u2018third party\u2019 contacted her this week, saying jewellery allegedly belonging to her was being offered for sale by her ex-boyfriend.\n\nThe theft claims follow a recent High Court ruling that Miss Ecclestone was wrong to try to reclaim a \u00a3380,000 Lamborghini supercar she gave to Mr Khyami, as a present, when they were dating.\n\nShe was told to pay more than \u00a320,000 in compensation to two car companies which were prevented from selling the vehicle while the case was ongoing.\n\nA judge said that the wrangling over the Lamborghini Aventador had \u2018caused everyone far more trouble than it is worth\u2019.\n\nNow Miss Ecclestone is at loggerheads with Mr Khyami again over jewellery. The model, who split from Mr Khyami after he cheated on her, says he had no right to have the items.\n\nA spokesman for Miss Ecclestone, who married former City stockbroker Jay Rutland last summer, told the Daily Mail last night: \u2018On Monday June 9 a concerned third party contacted us regarding jewellery purportedly belonging to Ms Ecclestone that was being sold by Omar Khyami.\n\nA spokesman for Miss Ecclestone, who married former City stockbroker Jay Rutland (both pictured, above) last summer, told the Daily Mail last night: 'On Monday June 9 a concerned third party contacted us regarding jewellery purportedly belonging to Ms Ecclestone that was being sold by Omar Khyami'\n\n\u2018These were sentimental pieces of jewellery, gifted to Tamara by her father. Ms Ecclestone is now assisting police with their inquiries.\u2019\n\nAt his flat overlooking Hyde Park, Mr Khyami \u2013 who was arrested after agreeing to attend a police station in West London on Wednesday \u2013 told the Mail: \u2018I haven\u2019t been with Tamara for two years.\n\n\u2018A lot of the jewellery we had together, she constantly changes her mind on whose it is. I was called by the police and asked to come for questioning about the theft of \u00a38,000 of jewellery. There were no handcuffs \u2013 they just said, \u201cSomeone has made an allegation and we have to follow it up\u201d.\n\n\u2018It was only a small piece of jewellery, not a watch or anything.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to hurt her. It\u2019s two years since we\u2019ve been together and I don\u2019t know what she wants.\u2019\n\nAccording to Miss Ecclestone, 29, the items were given to her by her billionaire father Bernie, the Formula One boss\n\nThe dispute comes five months after the row over the Lamborghini reached the High Court.\n\nMiss Ecclestone gave the car to Mr Khyami on his 38th birthday in April 2012, but when they broke up three months later she claimed it belonged to her.\n\nMr Khyami had used the car to secure a loan from a company called Elite Performance Cars Ltd in connection with a white Bentley which he bought Miss Ecclestone for Christmas in 2011.\n\nIn April 2013, bailiffs acting on behalf of Elite seized the car from a garage where Miss Ecclestone was having it serviced.\n\nThe firm sold the vehicle to Ansol Trading Ltd, which apparently arranged to sell it on to a buyer in Turkey until the heiress obtained a High Court injunction stopping the sale on the grounds that she had never actually given the Lamborghini to Mr Khyami.\n\nSpeaking in 2012, after she split from Mr Khyami following her discovery that he had featured in a sex tape, Miss Ecclestone said she did not regret the romance.\n\nShe said: \u2018I did have a lucky escape. Definitely. I don\u2019t regret the relationship, I\u2019m the kind of person who wants to fix people sometimes, and that\u2019s not really a healthy way to be. People have to want to change for themselves.\u2019\n\nIn February of last year, another of her former boyfriends was jailed for four years for plotting to blackmail her for \u00a3200,000.\n\nDerek Rose, 33, who dated her in 2002, was involved in a plot in which it was claimed he was approached to sell his story to a tabloid newspaper.\n\nRose was included in an email mentioning the possibility of discussing \u2018a non-release fee\u2019 and signing a confidentiality contract.\n\nSouthwark Crown Court in London heard that he had dated Miss Ecclestone when she was 17.\n\nThe blackmail arose from an email sent in November 2011 to her manager after the model had starred in Billion Dollar Girl, a reality TV programme exploring her life as a rich young person.\n\nThe email claimed Rose had been offered \u00a3200,000 to sell his story to a tabloid, despite no newspaper having made such an offer.\n\nAsked about Mr Khyami\u2019s arrest, Scotland Yard said last night: \u2018On Wednesday June 11, officers arrested a 40-year-old man on suspicion of the theft of jewellery from an address in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea.\n\n\u2018The man was taken into custody and since bailed to return on a date in July.\u2019\n\nToday Tamara Ecclestone said in a statement: 'It's incredibly sad that Omar feels that he can offer for sale sentimental items from me, items which he knew were not every day pieces.\n\n'There is no logical reason why he could think that two female pieces of jewellery, one even with my name engraved on it could ever be his.\n\n'I will continue to assist the police in their investigation.'\n\nA friend added: \u2018We all thought he was out of her life after the trial, it's an ugly reminder of their past relationship.\n\n'These were personal items, priceless gifts from her dad regardless of the value. Tamara was really upset that her dad has had to identify the pieces.\u2019", "description": "Businessman Omar Khyami, 40, whose two-and-a-half year relationship with the socialite ended in acrimony in 2012, was detained after theft allegations were made to police this week.", "authors": ["Stephen Wright For The Daily Mail", "Richard Marsden For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/12/article-2656669-1EB550D600000578-885_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2014-06-12"}
