But the reality is the medal tally is not that which we would have wanted and expected.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cIt could be better, it should be better. We\u2019ll obviously be talking with UK Sport with whom we have a really positive relationship about what are we going to do about it. How do we convert the nearlies into medals.\u201d\n\nThe Brits thought they had some consolation when the women\u2019s 4 x 4 quartet were upgraded to bronze after Jamaica were disqualified. But 45 minutes later the Jamaicans won their appeal and got the medal back.\n\nThe curtain came down on the championships with world athletics supremo Seb Coe admitting it was inevitable the best performances would be \u201cpermanently\u201d questioned.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nCoe claimed athletics is in \u201creally good shape\u201d after a champs that \u201con athlete performance, is the best we have ever had\u201d.\n\nThere were indeed world records (women\u2019s 400m hurdles and mixed 4 x 400m relay) and a string of championship bests.\n\nBut there was also the Salazar doping scandal bombshell which went off just before two athletes from his coaching group - Sifan Hassan and Donavan Brazier - won gold medals.\n\n(Image: Sportsfile via Getty)\n\nAfter Hassan\u2019s runaway 1500m triumph on Saturday night British rival Laura Muir said: \u201cGiven the news of the past few days, there is a cloud. There\u2019s no avoiding that.\u201d\n\nCoe admitted: \"Sadly it is the world we live in. it is inevitable that outstanding performances, given the broader nature of trust, are permanently questioned.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that when I was breaking three world records in 41 days back in 1979, there were people looking slightly askance at what I did.\u201d", "description": "\u201cIt could be better, it should be better.
