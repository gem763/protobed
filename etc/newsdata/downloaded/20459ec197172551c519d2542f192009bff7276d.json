Teitler, told People magazine. \u201cOur client will make no further statements.\u201d\n\nThis marks Roque\u2019s first public statement about Lauer in the nearly two years since he was fired from NBC for \u201cinappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.\u201d The pair, who married in 1998 and have three children, separated soon after he was terminated. She filed for divorce in July and it was finalized in September. (Their marital troubles began years earlier, as Roque reportedly filed for divorce in 1998, alleging \u201ccruel and inhumane\u201d acts, only to withdraw the documents soon after.)\n\nAnnette Roque and Matt Lauer in 2017.

He said any suggestion of nonconsensual sex was \u201ccategorically false.\u201d He said they had an \u201cextramarital affair\u201d and suggested Nevils became upset after he lost interest. Nevils slammed Lauer\u2019s open letter, accusing him of \u201cvictim blaming.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Rogue speaking out, so is Farrow. In his first interview about the book, given to The Hollywood Reporter, he claims he uncovered seven allegations of workplace sexual misconduct in total by Lauer \u2014 as well as seven non-disclosure agreements. Several of those included \u201chush-money payouts\u201d to accusers, according to the report. Farrow spoke to some of Lauer\u2019s accusers \u2014 including Nevils \u2014 for his book, which comes out Oct. 15.\n\nAn NBC spokesperson disputes that, however, via the Today on Thursday. They say they reached agreements with two women who alleged workplace sexual misconduct by Lauer. They added that neither of those women has a non-disclosure agreement, meaning they are free to share their stories. (Nevils went on medical leave from NBC in 2018 \u2014 after her claim against Lauer got him fired \u2014 and collected \u201cseven figures\u201d from the network, according to Farrow\u2019s book.)\n\nMatt Lauer has broken his silence in an open letter. His accuser responded, calling the letter \u201ca case study in victim shaming.\u201d @StephGosk has the details. pic.twitter.com/zFPAFDyB8X \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) October 10, 2019\n\nIn Lauer\u2019s open letter, he did acknowledge other accusers beyond Nevils. He wrote, \u201cFor two years, the women with whom I had extramarital relationships have abandoned shared responsibility, and instead, shielded themselves from blame behind false allegations ... They have done enormous damage in the process. And I will no longer provide them the shelter of my silence.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to Today on Thursday, Farrow said, \u201cThe stories and comments from the brave women who spoke out for the book will be enough to refute anything he has to say.\u201d", "description": "Ronan Farrow claims to have found seven allegations of workplace sexual misconduct against Lauer \u2014 and an alleged connection to Harvey Weinstein.", "authors": ["Suzy Byrne", "Editor", "Yahoo Entertainment"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5bNJqktizM_gY19fL16mSA--~B/aD0zMDAwO3c9MjAyOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/69ad9a80-eb65-11e9-a3df-38719ec92432", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
