Braden is our No. 1 goalie.\u201d\n\nIn the final year of his contract, Holtby entered this season the focus of attention, so his early struggles are bringing greater scrutiny. Holtby has a 1-1-2 record with a .846 save percentage, letting in 18 goals on 119 attempts.\n\nReirden said the team will evaluate after Wednesday\u2019s game to see if Holtby will start on Friday against the New York Rangers, but he will do \u201cwhat is best for the team,\u201d no matter the decision.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just \u2026 I wanted to get a good start and maybe getting a little ahead of myself and, in some ways, trying to push too hard,\u201d Holtby said. \u201cI just need to take a deep breath and go out and play. I mean, it\u2019s seven games in. In a couple months, you won\u2019t remember this conversation. You just stick to the process and keep doing what you think can you can do to win?\n\nAD\n\nHoltby, the 2016 Vezina Trophy winner, endured a memorable slump during the 2017-18 season, when he was replaced by Philip Grubauer in net to start the postseason. Holtby then replaced Grubauer in the team\u2019s third playoff game and led the Stanley Cup run.\n\n\u201cUsually it\u2019s just getting back to the basics of things,\u201d Holtby said. \u201cA lot of times when things are going your way, you\u2019re usually pushing forward too fast and make things (instead) of just letting them come to you. It\u2019s just getting back to the basics of playing, trusting your instincts and, you know, not letting it affect you. Just go out and play.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nReirden is emphatic his confidence in Holtby has not swayed, and his teammates have backed him as well, with forward T.J. Oshie saying Holtby\u2019s performance in Monday\u2019s loss was one of the least of his concerns.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHolts is one of the best in the league,\u201d Oshie said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to say anything to him. I\u2019m sure he looked at whatever he had to look at and you know he looked good out there today and that is probably the least of my concerns right now is Holts\u2019 game last night. We didn\u2019t give him much help. He\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\n\nThe presence of Samsonov, who beat out Pheonix Copley for the backup in training camp, adds intrigue to the situation. Will Holtby\u2019s slow start prompt Reirden and the coaching staff to give more starts Samsonov, considered the Capitals\u2019 goalie of the future? The team wants to be cautious with making sure his development is not rushed, but at the same time, the staff acknowledges they need to do what is best for the team.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou have a young goaltender and doing the right thing for his development, doing the right thing for our team, doing the right thing for Braden, all of that is all wrapped into one especially within a position that\u2019s so important,\u201d Reirden said. \u201cYou treat him as if he\u2019s a normal player but at the same time he\u2019s a goaltender. You can only go so far with that statement because it is a little bit of a different beast.\u201d\n\nCaps expected lines vs Toronto:\n\n\n\nOvechkin-Backstrom-Oshie\n\nHagelin-Kuznetsov-Wilson\n\nVrana-Eller-Hathaway\n\nLeipsic-Stephenson-Panik\n\n\n\nSiegenthaler-Carlson\n\nOrlov-Gudas\n\nJensen-Lewington \u2014 Samantha Pell (@SamanthaJPell) October 16, 2019\n\nRead more on the Capitals:\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s not a goaltending controversy at this point,\" Capitals Coach Todd Reirden said. \"Braden is our No. 1 goalie.\u201d", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/O9xZwItv4djP3Or81FdzUQ_VC94=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GQQ7LIXO4II6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
