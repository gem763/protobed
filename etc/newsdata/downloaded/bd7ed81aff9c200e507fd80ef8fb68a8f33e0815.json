An artist's impression of Oumuamua is pictured\n\nThose objects not only portend extraterrestrial pay-dirt on the moon, says Loeb, but studying them could also help to inform scientists exactly how much may be lurking on the surface.\n\n'With this calibration at hand, one can calculate the amount of interstellar material that has collected on the moon\u2019s surface over its history,' he writes.\n\nLoeb says that based on current measurements of the flux - amount of energy - of interstellar objects, the lunar surface may contain as much as 30 parts per million of lunar surface material.\n\n'Amino acids, which serve as the building blocks of 'life as we know it,' could amount to a few parts per hundred billion,' says Loeb.\n\nThis rendering (pictured above) shows a concept of what a base on the lunar surface may look like. From here, humans would be able to explore the lunar surface.\n\nMicro-fossils of extinct alien life, similar to the 3.4 billion-year-old versions found on Earth are also a distinct possibility, he says.\n\nOf course, even more exciting than bits of interstellar matter, would be the prospect of a more overt sign of life in other parts of the universe.\n\n'Even more exciting would be to find traces of technological equipment that crashed on the lunar surface a billion years ago, amounting to a letter from an alien civilization saying, \u201cWe exist.\u201d' write Loeb.\n\n'Without checking our mailbox, we would never know that such a message arrived.'\n\nWith the potential for a moon base being built by either the US or China, Loeb says those findings could be just around the corner.", "description": "Objects collected by the moon's surface may extend back billions of years making the moon a kind of 'mailbox' for objects flying around our solar system says Harvard professor Andrew Loeb.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/26/22/9852990-0-image-a-12_1569534897845.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
