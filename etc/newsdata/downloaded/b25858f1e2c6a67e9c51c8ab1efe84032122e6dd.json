The phone call is the central element in the ongoing impeachment dispute between the White House and the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps,\u201d Mr. Zelensky told Mr. Trump, according to a later White House account of the conversation. \u201cSpecifically, we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.\u201d\n\nKyiv\u2019s intense interest in more Javelins isn\u2019t hard to understand. Military leaders say the Javelin is a game-changer in any fight against armored forces. It can be operated by a single soldier, weighs about 50 pounds and is highly effective against a variety of targets at extended ranges during day or night and in all weather conditions.\n\nLocked in a grinding civil war against Russian-backed separatist militias in its eastern half, Ukrainian officials have made no secret of their appetite for more Javelins, which the Trump administration greenlighted for sale last year.\n\n\u201cThe Javelin can really defeat any armored vehicle that any military currently fields,\u201d said retired Army Lt. Gen. Thomas Spoehr, director of the Center of National Defense at the Heritage Foundation.\n\nOne of its selling points is a tandem warhead. The front blasts a gap into the tank\u2019s explosive reactive armor, and the secondary warhead punches into the vehicle. The Javelin also is a \u201cfire and forget\u201d weapon, unlike systems that require the operator to guide the missile to the target.\n\n\u201cOnce you have your target, the warhead is going to find its way there. Meanwhile, you can seek cover,\u201d Gen. Spoehr said. \u201cYou\u2019re no longer a target.\u201d\n\nThe Javelin is the replacement for the bulky M-47 Dragon anti-tank guided missile. It had a maximum range of about 1,000 yards, compared with the 4,000-yard targets that a Javelin can hit. A large back blast when a Dragon was fired could reveal the position of the operator to enemy forces. That is not the case with the Javelin.\n\nThe missile \u201cpops out and then the rocket motor ignites,\u201d Gen. Spoehr said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a giant signature. As a gunner, you\u2019re much less susceptible to having somebody returning fire immediately.\u201d\n\nIn March 2018, Mr. Trump approved the $47 million sale of 210 Javelin anti-tank missiles and 37 launchers to Ukraine. It was the first lethal military assistance that the U.S. provided to Ukraine in the separatist war. The Obama administration repeatedly expressed reluctance to sell the Javelin and other lethal weaponry to Kyiv for fear of provoking Russia and expanding the conflict.\n\nOn Oct. 3, the State Department approved the sale of additional 150 Javelin missiles and related equipment to Ukraine with a price tag of just under $40 million, according to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.\n\n\u201cThis proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by improving the security of Ukraine. The Javelin system will help Ukraine build its long-term defense capacity to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity in order to meet its national defense requirements,\u201d the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement.\n\nSymbolic worth\n\nThe Javelin\u2019s symbolic worth may be as valuable as its battlefield capabilities for Ukraine, which is perpetually pressed by a bigger and stronger Russia across the border.\n\n\u201cYou see a little bit of a bounce in the step of a Ukrainian soldier when he or she has had the opportunity to embrace this system that allows them to better defend their turf,\u201d Gen. Tod Wolters, the head of U.S. European Command, said last week at the Pentagon.\n\nFormer Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who was defeated by Mr. Zelensky in an election this year, hailed the arrival of the first Javelins last year as a \u201cdream come true.\u201d The missile, he said, \u201cis a symbol of cooperation with our American partners.\u201d\n\nOfficials said Ukraine should have no trouble absorbing the system into its armed forces and the sale should not alter the basic military balance of power in the region.\n\nAbout 20 countries are thought to be using the Javelin system. The weapon also has been reported to be in Libya.\n\nIan Brzezinski, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Scowcroft Center on International Security, has argued that the U.S. delivery of Javelins would \u201csubstantively increase Ukraine\u2019s ability to impose costs on Russian forces.\u201d\n\nIn an assessment posted on the think tank\u2019s website last year, Mr. Brzezinski carries symbolic weight not just for the Ukrainians but for the Russians as well.\n\n\u201cThe Javelins will also likely reanimate among Russian commanders uncomfortable memories of the role that U.S. shoulder-mounted Stinger air defense missiles played in forcing the Soviet Union\u2019s retreat from Afghanistan in the late 1980s,\u201d he wrote.\n\nJavelins alone will not force Russia out of Crimea and the Donbas region, but they \u201csubstantially increase\u201d Ukraine\u2019s ability to level the playing field, Mr. Brzezinski said.\n\nThe Javelin is a multipurpose weapon. In addition to its usefulness as a \u201ctank killer,\u201d the missile can take out a bunker or even moving targets.\n\n\u201cIf you want the munition to go through the roof, just toggle \u2018top attack\u2019 mode,\u201d Gen. Spoehr said. \u201cThe missile will choose to attack the target from the roof.\u201d\n\nThe Javelin does not require a great deal of training before an operator is proficient.\n\n\u201cA little bit of training, and all of a sudden you\u2019ve got a guy who can defeat any vehicle that any military can field,\u201d Gen. Spoehr said. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any technology that can defeat a Javelin right now.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
