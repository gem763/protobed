Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the obscure LaRouche movement is in the spotlight.\n\nThe group, which supports President Donald Trump, said it had 'trolled' Ocasio-Cortez with the audience plant at her town hall meeting in Queens on Thursday night.\n\nThe unidentified woman ranted: 'We're not going to be here for much longer because of the climate crisis! We only have a few months left! ... I think your next campaign slogan has to be this, we got to start eating babies!'\n\nThe LaRouche movement is a political group promoting the late Lyndon LaRouche and his ideas, which dates back to 1960s radical Marxist student groups but which has evolved to embrace exotic conspiracy theories.\n\nLyndon LaRouche, who died earlier this year, is seen at a press conference in 1986\n\nLaRouche followers rally against the Green New Deal in New York City on September 25. Daniel Burke, LaRouchePAC-endorsed candidate for US Senate from New Jersey, is on the right\n\nViewed by some as a fringe political cult, the LaRouch movement has been dubbed 'one of the strangest political groups in American history' by the Heritage Foundation.\n\nLyndon LaRouche himself was convicted in 1988 of convicted on fraud charges related to fund-raising, which his supporters are convinced was a politically motivated prosecution. He died in February 2019 at the age of 96.\n\nOver the decades, the LaRouche movement has developed a complex and esoteric political outlook, which calls for reforming the global financial system and building a land bridge between Alaska and Russia.\n\n'The LaRouchies are pretty exotic,' tweeted Matthew Sweet, author of a book about the group, Operation Chaos.\n\nA woman wearing a shirt reading 'Save the planet - Eat children' speaks out at a town hall event for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday. The LaRouche movement claimed responsibility\n\nAOC reacts to the woman who screamed that we must 'eat babies' to solve climate change\n\n'They believe that the Queen controls the drugs trade. They think Prince Philip wants to start WW3. They think Bertrand Russell used the Beatles as part of a secret British psy war against the USA. They are, to use a technical term, nuts,' he continued.\n\nThe LaRouch movement published an article in 1997 arguing that there is evidence that 'justifies labelling Queen Elizabeth II as one of the world\u2019s leading drug traffickers.'\n\nMore recently, LaRouche movement activists have rejected the notion of human-caused climate change, insisting that reducing carbon emissions is a 'mass murder policy, designed by Wall Street and the City of London.'\n\n'The result will be not having a sufficient electricity supply for the developing and developed countries alike, increased global infant mortality, shortened lifespans, and depopulation, the group said in a recent missive.\n\nLaRouche group members protest in Manhattan in 2014. The group is not clearly definable under traditional political categories but strongly supports Trump\n\n'The LaRouchies have been enemies of the green movement for decades. They used to carry signs that read 'Feed Jane Fonda to the whales'. It's linked with their conspiracy theory about the Queen's 'green fascism',' Sweet wrote.\n\nSweet noted that the LaRouche movement was once a fairly ordinary Marxist movement, and claimed that Bernie Sanders had at one time subscribed to their literature.\n\nToday, the LaRouch movement is sometimes described as neo-fascist, and Sweet writes that they are 'now firm Trump supporters' but 'politically unclassifiable.'", "description": "The group, which supports President Donald Trump, said it had 'trolled' Ocasio-Cortez with the audience plant at her town hall meeting in Queens on Thursday night.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/17/19307330-0-image-a-10_1570208107555.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
