The outcome effectively supports and bolsters the landslide vote which saw MPs in Westminster extend the right to abortion to Northern Ireland back in July. It was agreed abortion would be decriminalised there unless a devolved executive at Stormont is re-established by 21 October.\n\nAlthough the ruling in Belfast High Court does not have a legal or technical impact on the decision to decriminalise abortion, it exerts political pressure on Westminster to push on with efforts to reform restrictions around abortion in Northern Ireland.\n\nGrainne Teggart, the Northern Ireland campaign manager at Amnesty International, which supported Ms Ewart in her case, said: \u201cIt serves as vindication of the need for reform that was secured at the UK parliament. It is the courts saying to the UK government the existing law violates human rights and signifies change is needed and must happen now. The courts have spoken today and it is loud and clear.\n\n\u201cIt is confirmation of the harm that has been caused by the existing system. We are at a critical point in the fight for abortion rights as both the UK parliament and the courts have signalled change needs to happen now. But nothing is secure until 21 October. We needed the courts to have the final say on this matter and confirm what we have long known \u2013 that the law needs to be overhauled. We eagerly look forward to 21 October and the law taking effect not just for Sarah but for other women.\n\n\u201cThis will signal an end to the current regime which has harmed countless women and girls \u2013 including the mother whose prosecution for buying abortion pills for her daughter which will now fall away and the 12-year-old Northern Irish rape victim forced to travel to England under police escort for an abortion.\u201d", "description": "Northern Ireland has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the world and Victorian legislation means women seeking the procedure there can face up to life in prison.
