The Democratic presidential hopeful said he's \"not going anywhere.\" USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren on Thursday called for President Donald Trump to release transcripts of phone conversations between him and President Xi of China after reports emerged that Trump raised both her and former Vice President Joe Biden's political prospects.\n\nA phone call with Xi on June 18 was stored in the same highly-secured electronic system used to hold the phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky at the center of a whistleblower complaint that has led to an impeachment inquiry against Trump, CNN reported.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Trump publicly declared that China should investigate Biden.\n\n\"By the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\" Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn.\n\nWarren was reportedly mentioned in the phone call as she was beginning to gain traction in the crowded field of 2020 contenders, often emerging as a front-runner along with Biden in polling.\n\n\u201cTrump can say what he wants about me, but it's outrageous that any president would sell out the people of Hong Kong behind closed doors,\u201d Warren wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe public must see the transcript of Trump's call with Xi. And we need a leader who will stand up for our values.\u201d\n\nTrump can say what he wants about me, but it's outrageous that any president would sell out the people of Hong Kong behind closed doors.\n\n\n\nThe public must see the transcript of Trump's call with Xi. And we need a leader who will stand up for our values. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 3, 2019\n\nAccording to CNN, \"In that call, Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on Hong Kong protests as trade talks progressed.\"\n\nBiden responded on Twitter after Trump first mentioned China, accusing him of attempting to \"rig the primary and pick your opponent,\" adding that the president \"cannot extort foreign governments\" in his effort to win reelection.\n\n\"It\u2019s an abuse of power. It violates your oath of office. And it jeopardizes our national security,\" Biden said.\n\nMr. President, you cannot extort foreign governments to help you win re-election. It\u2019s an abuse of power. It violates your oath of office. And it jeopardizes our national security. I know you want to rig the primary and pick your opponent, but I\u2019m not going anywhere. https://t.co/LZQ8W3fmU6 \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 3, 2019\n\nThe demand for the release of the transcript echoed California Sen. Kamala Harris, who called on the White House to release documents about Trump\u2019s conversations with Xi \"because we need to know what he has now said in private conversations, because we obviously know what he is saying in public.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me \u2013 I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Biden said in Reno on Wednesday night. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me. And you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/03/elizabeth-warren-calls-donald-trump-china-transcripts/3859441002/", "description": "The names of two of President Donald Trump's political rivals came up during a June 18 call with President Xi of China, CNN reported.", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
