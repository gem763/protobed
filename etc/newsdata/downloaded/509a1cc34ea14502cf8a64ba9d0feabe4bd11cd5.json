[KIM KYUNG-BIN]\n\nThe Tune is one of the biggest up-and-coming gugak (traditional Korean music) groups of the year.After winning \u201cSori Frontier,\u201d a program nurturing gugak musicians hosted by the Jeonju International Sori Festival in 2014, the five-member group was chosen by \u201cJourney to Korean Music,\u201d another project for nurturing gugak musicians, last year.Now the group is getting invitations from an array of international music festivals including Sharjah World Music Festival of the United Arab Emirates, Sol Madrid of Spain, a music market, and Visa for Music, another music expo held in Morocco.The most imminent performance for The Tune is a show that will be held at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York on Nov. 7.The following are edited excerpts from a recent interview with The Tune.. We stay within the boundary of gugak but we move in and out of the boundary, too. We find inspiration for our songs from the performance of a person who plays a small gong in nongak [traditional Korean music performed by farmers] or from a folk song that was used to sing by fishermen. We build up our own identity by adding our own interpretations to traditional songs.It is our intention to show that we blur boundaries within music. The five of us all have different backgrounds. One of us majored in classical music composition and the other studied art. We\u2019re writing a song as a whole. Each person does her part and then we find ourselves with a song at the end. This [procedure] makes our music unique.We see so many young musicians in recent years and there are a lot of contests and support programs for them, too. But once you win a competition, it does not guarantee you a successful career path. [When you win such programs] you can earn some time to concentrate on your music. We build up experience by performing shows regularly.Our music is closer to world music rather than being traditional. We applied to the \u201cJourney to Korean Music\u201d several times and we were finally chosen last year. I think our music is more popular with non-Koreans. They listen to our music as it is. Our music is complete with feedback from audiences and we find [non-Korean audiences] are [more] willing to be part of it.Since the gugak music scene is quite rigid, our music was not welcomed at first, but we find more older people are fond of crossover music these days. But you need to know the basics before you start.BY YOO JU-HYUN [estyle@joongang.co.kr]\uc5ec\uc131 5\uc778\uc870 \ucc3d\uc791\uc74c\uc545\uadf8\ub8f9 \ub354\ud2a0 \u201c\uc804\ud1b5\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8 \uc54c\uace0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud574\uc11d\ud574\uc57c\u201d\u2018\ub354\ud2a0\u2019\uc740 \uc62c\ud574 \ud574\uc678\uc9c4\ucd9c\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud65c\ubc1c\ud55c \uc2e0\uc9c4 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc774\ub2e4. 2014\ub144 \u2018\uc18c\ub9ac\ud504\ub7f0\ud2f0\uc5b4\u2019 \uc6b0\uc2b9\uc73c\ub85c \ub370\ubdd4\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc9c0\ub09c\ud574 \u2018\uc800\ub2c8\ud22c\ucf54\ub9ac\uc548\ubba4\uc9c1\u2019\uc5d0 \uc120\uc815\ub41c \uc774\ud6c4 \uc62c\ud574\ub9cc \ud574\ub3c4 \ub274\uc695 \ub9c1\ucee8\uc13c\ud130\ub97c \ube44\ub86f\ud574 \uc544\ub78d\uc5d0\ubbf8\ub9ac\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0e4\ub974\uc790\uc6d4\ub4dc\ubba4\uc9c1\ud398\uc2a4\ud2f0\ubc8c, \uc2a4\ud398\uc778\uc758 \uc3e0\ub9c8\ub4dc\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc74c\uc545\ub9c8\ucf13\uacfc \ubaa8\ub85c\ucf54\uc758 \ube44\uc790\ud3ec\ubba4\uc9c1 \uc74c\uc545\ub9c8\ucf13 \ub4f1\uc5d0 \ucd08\uccad\ubc1b\uc558\ub2e4.\u2018\ub354\ud2a0\u2019\uc740 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc74c\uc545\uc744 \ud558\ub098.\u201c\uad6d\uc545 \uc548\uc5d0 \uba38\ubb3c\uace0 \uad6d\uc545 \ubc16\uc744 \ub178\ub2c8\ub294 \uc74c\uc545\uc774\ub2e4. \ub18d\uc545\uc758 \uc0c1\uc1e0\ub180\uc74c, \uc870\uae30\uc7a1\uc774 \ub178\ub3d9\uc694 \ub4f1 \ud55c\uad6d\uc804\ud1b5\uc74c\uc545\uc758 \uc6d0\ud615\uc5d0\uc11c \uc18c\uc7ac\ub97c \ucc3e\uc544 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc2dd\uc758 \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \uacc1\ub4e4\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0c9\uae54\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4\ub0b8\ub2e4.\u201d\uc815\uae30\uacf5\uc5f0 \ud0c0\uc774\ud2c0\uc774 \u2018\uc6d4\ub2f4, \uc4f1 \ub118\uc5b4\uc624\uc138\uc694\u2019\uc778\ub370.\u201c\uc74c\uc545\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubb34\ub108\ub728\ub824\ubcf4\uc790\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8\ub2e4. \uc74c\uc545\uc801 \ubc30\uacbd\uc774 \ub2e4\ub978 5\uba85\uc774 \ub9cc\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ud074\ub798\uc2dd \uc791\uace1\ud55c \uce5c\uad6c\ub3c4 \uc788\uace0 \ubbf8\uc220\uc804\uacf5\uc790\ub3c4 \uc788\ub294\ub370, \ud55c \uc0ac\ub78c\uc774 \uace1\uc744 \uc4f0\ub294 \uac8c \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uac01\uc790\uc758 \ubaab\uc744 \ub2e4\ud558\uba74 \uc608\uae30\uce58 \ubabb\ud55c \uace1\uc774 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4\uc9c0\uace0, \uadf8\ub798\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc74c\uc545\uc774 \uc720\ub2c8\ud06c\ud574\uc9c4\ub2e4.\u201d\uac01\uc885 \ucc3d\uc791 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc774 \uce58\uc5f4\ud558\ub2e4.\u201c\ucc3d\uc791\uc74c\uc545\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \uc80a\uc740 \uce5c\uad6c\ub4e4\uc774 \uad49\uc7a5\ud788 \ub9ce\uc544\uc838\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc74c\uc545\uc744 \uc120\ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc, \ub4f1\uc6a9\ubb38\ub3c4 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc5f4\ub9b0\ub2e4. \ud55c\ubc88 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc7a1\uc558\ub2e4\uace0 \uae38\uc774 \ud655 \ub6ab\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54a\ub354\ub77c. \uc790\uae30 \uc74c\uc545 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0 \ud004\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \ub192\uc77c \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ubc84\ub294 \uc815\ub3c4\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub3c4 \uafb8\uc900\ud788 \uc790\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uae30 \uacf5\uc5f0\uc744 \ud558\uba70 \ub0b4\uacf5\uc744 \uc313\uc558\ub2e4.\u201d\ud574\uc678 \ucd08\uccad\uc744 \ub9ce\uc774 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.\u201c\uc6b0\ub9ac \uc74c\uc545\uc774 \uc804\ud1b5\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc6d4\ub4dc\ubba4\uc9c1 \uc131\ud5a5\uc774\ub2e4. \u2018\uc800\ub2c8\ud22c\ucf54\ub9ac\uc548\ubba4\uc9c1\u2019\uc5d0 \uba87 \ucc28\ub840 \ub3c4\uc804\ud574 \uc791\ub144\uc5d0 \uc120\uc815\ub410\ub294\ub370, \uc678\uad6d\uc778\ub4e4 \ubc18\uc751\uc774 \uc544\ubb34\ub798\ub3c4 \ub354 \uc88b\ub2e4. \uc74c\uc545 \uc790\uccb4\ub85c \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83 \uac19\uace0, \ucc38\uc5ec\ud615 \uc74c\uc545\uc774\ub77c \ud398\uc2a4\ud2f0\ubc8c \ub4f1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f4\uad11\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc18\uc751\ud574 \uc8fc\uc2e0\ub2e4.\u201d\ud559\uad50\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\ub9cc \ubc30\uc6e0\uc744 \ud150\ub370, \ucc3d\uc791\uc74c\uc545\uc758 \uc0c9\uae54\uc740 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ucc3e\uc558\ub098.\u201c\ud55c\uad6d\uc74c\uc545\uc774 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \uc804\ud1b5\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\ub290\ub0d0\uac00 \uad00\uac74\uc774 \ub410\ub2e4. \uad6d\uc545\uacc4\uac00 \ub3c4\uc81c\uc2dd \uad50\uc721\uc774 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uace0 \ub208\uce58\ub97c \ub9ce\uc774 \ubcf4\ub294 \uc138\uacc4\ub77c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub3c4 \ucc98\uc74c\uc5d4 \uc695\uc744 \uba39\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc694\uc998\uc5d4 \uc5b4\ub974\uc2e0\ub4e4\ub3c4 \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4\uc624\ubc84\ub97c \uc88b\uc544\ud558\uc2e0\ub2e4. \ub2e4\ub9cc \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc744 \ud655\uc2e4\ud788 \uc54c\uace0 \ud558\ub294 \uac8c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac83 \uac19\ub2e4.\u201d\uc720\uc8fc\ud604 \uae30\uc790", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/30204152.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
