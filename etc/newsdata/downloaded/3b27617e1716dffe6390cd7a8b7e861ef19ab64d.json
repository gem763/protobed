They don\u2019t even have an embassy in each other\u2019s country.\n\nThe two countries rarely come up in the same sentence. That is, unless you\u2019re discussing their flags.\n\nAside from slight variations in color shading, the two countries\u2019 flags appear identical \u2013 an observation Tesla CEO Elon Musk appears to have just discovered and shared with Twitter.\n\nWhy aren\u2019t more people talking about this!? pic.twitter.com/iUFIBcDQrp \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 9, 2019\n\nAccording to the online Encyclopedia Britannica, Romania initially displayed a flag with horizontal stripes of blue, yellow, and red before settling on its current vertical design in 1861.\n\nChad decided on its own flag design after it achieved independence from France in 1959.\n\nThe country initially considered a green, yellow, and red design but quickly discovered Mali had already taken the same pattern. It then swapped the green for the blue \u2013 inadvertently creating a flag that was almost identical to Romania\u2019s.\n\nChad\u2019s flag is not the only one to resemble other flags \u2013 here are some other examples\n\nThe flag of Mali, the country Chad tried to avoid copying, is similar to Senegal\u2019s \u2013 a single green star in the middle appears to separate the two flags. Guinea\u2019s also replicates Mali\u2019s design but is reversed.\n\nBoth Indonesia and Monaco fly two horizontal stripes: red over white. Poland similarly flies white over red.\n\nIreland and Ivory Coast share the same design, but it is flipped on the flagpole.\n\n#ColombiaVsIvoryCoast Ireland and Cote d'Ivoire are not the only countries with similar flags \u2013 here are some more: pic.twitter.com/83xly7bkFy \u2014 Irish Foreign Ministry (@dfatirl) June 19, 2014\n\nAll of these similarities may have stemmed from coincidence, but other flags have a specific reason for slight variations to a theme.\n\nEcuador, Venezuela, and Colombia all sport the same-colored horizontal stripes, but that\u2019s because they used to be part of the same country of Gran Colombia, which dissolved in 1822, according to Britannica.", "description": "Business Insider - Tesla CEO Elon Musk turned to Twitter to question why countries like Chad and Romania had almost identical flags..
