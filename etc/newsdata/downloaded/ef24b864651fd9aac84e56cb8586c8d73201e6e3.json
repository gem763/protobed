It was 2008 and the cannabis trade promised riches, he says, so he paid $15,000 to brokers for a fake passport and a spot on a tour group to Europe.\n\n\u2013 Police raids \u2013\n\nHe slipped away from the tour in France and joined a well-worn migrant route to a camp in Calais where Vietnamese people smugglers arranged for him to cross the channel to Britain \u2014 under the belly of a lorry.\n\n\u201cIf you fall you\u2019re dead,\u201d explains Cuong, who made the overnight journey to Dover with three other Vietnamese migrants.\n\nArriving in a new country and speaking no English, his options were limited, so Cuong again turned to the migrant network for help. He ended up in Bristol and worked for a man running several cannabis farms in suburban homes.\n\nCuong says he had to work on his own, housebound and reliant on weekly food drops by his handlers.\n\n\u201cI got up early, ate rice and prepared feed for my plants\u2026 put them under lights for two hours and watered them,\u201d recalls Cuong, his mundane routine punctuated by fear of arrest.\n\nIt was a common set-up: houses rented or bought in inconspicuous suburbs and converted into drug operations.\n\nPolice have also busted cannabis farms in dog kennels, pubs, an abandoned hospital and a even former nuclear bunker \u2014 many run by Vietnamese.\n\nAround 12 percent of all cannabis convicts in the country are Southeast Asian, more than any other non-European nationality, a National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council shows.\n\nIt took six months for cops to show up in Cuong\u2019s neighbourhood.\n\nPanicked, he bundled up as many plants as he could in bin bags and made a run for it. But it wasn\u2019t long before he was back in business, growing weed in a hotel near Bristol.\n\nHe had earned nearly $19,000 \u2014 a small fortune compared to salaries back home \u2014 but accuses his boss of cheating him out of thousands more.\n\n\u2013 Forced labour \u2013\n\nMost migrants from Vietnam come from poor central provinces. Many head for the UK, sending home cash which is spent on new cars, motorbikes and home renovations.\n\nBut the journey isn\u2019t cheap.\n\nSmugglers charge up to $40,000 for travel documents and a plane ticket, usually to eastern Europe where the overland trip to the UK begins.\n\nSome fall prey to traffickers; by the time they make it across the English Channel they are thousands of dollars in debt and forced to work in brothels, nail bars or cannabis farms.\n\nMore than 3,100 Vietnamese adults and children were identified as potential trafficking victims by the UK government between 2009 and 2018, according to a report by Anti-Slavery International, ECPAT UK and Pacific Links Foundation.\n\nCuong eventually headed to London, where he drifted for several years, selling drugs and training new weed farmers.\n\nBut in 2014 he was arrested for smoking cannabis. His fingerprints tied him to the Bristol grow house.\n\nCrown Court records show he was convicted for growing cannabis and sentenced to 10 months jail. Eventually the UK Home Office deported him.\n\nHe joined more than 1,600 returnees to Vietnam either by choice or by force since 2014, including at least 22 who were under the age of 14, according to Home Office data.\n\nHundreds of other children have been identified as potential trafficking victims by the Home Office.\n\nSome are back in Vietnam in debt and at serious risk of being re-trafficked in what amounts to a \u201cmerry-go-round\u201d of crime and poverty, according to independent trafficking expert Mimi Vu.\n\nAdjusting to life in Vietnam has been tough for Cuong, who returned broke and now lives in a bare house in Haiphong.\n\nBut he says he is reformed and hopes to open a salon to help provide for the baby he is expecting with his new girlfriend.\n\n\u201cIn the past I had to be tough and aggressive,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I have to be soft and nice.\u201d", "description": "Haiphong (Vietnam) (AFP) \u2013 Holed up alone in a suburban British house thousands of miles from home, cannabis farmer Cuong Nguyen spent months", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
