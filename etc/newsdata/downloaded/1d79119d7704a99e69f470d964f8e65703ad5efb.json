This is her second nod by Booker judges. She also won in 2000 for \"The Blind Assassin.\"\n\nThe duo will split the $63,000 prize.", "description": "Margaret Atwood, Bernardine Evaristo Share Booker Prize", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/16/2019101600556_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
