He couldn\u2019t drink or eat. After he died, we buried him. I didn\u2019t know he was alive. I was very surprised, shocked, too.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about him. I\u2019m happy and sad at the same time.\u201d\n\n(Image: AsiaWire)\n\nLocal authorities said they were still verifying Mr Liu\u2019s claims and investigating.\n\nThe grandfather said the boy\u2019s older twin brother was healthy.\n\nZhou Shanghong, the doctor and mum-of-two who examined the boy after he was found, had previously said she would apply to adopt the boy if his family were not found. It is unclear if this still stands, now that the boy's grandfather has come forward.", "description": "WARNING: Distressing content.
