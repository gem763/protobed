Not only was I trying to make new friends and adjust to college life, but I was learning to live in a completely foreign culture, too.\n\nThree years later, I\u2019ve noticed many cultural differences between the two countries I\u2019ve lived in, from Americans\u2019 relationship with money to the way they eat at restaurants. In many aspects of life, Chinese people couldn\u2019t behave more differently.\n\nHere are 17 of the biggest cultural differences I\u2019ve observed between the US and China.\n\nIn the US, restaurant waiters really like to chat with you\n\nDean Dixon/AP Images for Outback\n\nThe servers at US restaurants try hard to leave a good impression on their customers, as tips make up a large percentage of their salary.\n\nIn China, however, restaurants pay their staff a fixed income. Servers focus more on getting food on the table quickly rather than taking their time and treating the customers like their friends. And waiters in China are still just as willing to accommodate you if you want to modify your order.\n\nGoods at farmers markets are more expensive than the food in grocery stores\n\nArina P Habich / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the US, when people think of farmers markets, they often think fresh, juicy tomatoes or organic eggs from local farms. In many cases, produce at the market is more expensive because of its high quality and freshness, even when compared to the organic goods sold at chain grocery stores.\n\nMeanwhile, in China, grocery shopping at a supermarket is the more expensive way to buy your food.\n\nFor many Chinese people, going to the local farmers market is part of their daily routine. Every morning, vendors come to the market and set up their booths, selling everything from spices to seasonal fruits and vegetables to even live fish.\n\nGrocery stores tend to be more expensive because it\u2019s harder to keep the produce fresh while being transported long distances. However, stores offer a cleaner and less chaotic shopping atmosphere than markets, which is why some shoppers prefer them.\n\nPeople don\u2019t usually bargain at markets in America\n\nHarrison Jacobs/Business Insider\n\nBargaining isn\u2019t really an American thing. Once the price is set, the shoppers either accept it or move on. However, one can bargain for pretty much everything at a Chinese market. Your bargaining skills can get you cheaper groceries!\n\nIn China, even college students can afford to dine out every day\n\nChandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe food industry in China is massive and diverse, from hawkers on the street to high-end dining places.\n\nFor college students in China, dining outside of school cafeterias is affordable. One can buy a bowl of noodles at a noodle shop for about $US1. Stir-fried dishes at local diners close to universities usually lower their prices, from $US4 to $US10 per dish; and hotpots start at about $US9, and can feed at least two or three people.\n\nAmerican people drink coffee, while Chinese people drink tea\n\nChina is the birthplace of tea, so it makes sense that Chinese people prefer it to coffee.\n\nAmericans, on the other hand, are obsessed with coffee \u2013 half of Americans drink it every day, in fact, while less than a quarter drink tea.\n\nPeople in the US use microwave ovens to heat their water\n\nTo make drinks like instant coffee, Americans often put the powder and cold water in a cup first, put the cup into the microwave oven, heat it for three minutes, and take it out to stir it.\n\nIn China, however, since people make tea with boiling water, it\u2019s common to have a kettle at home to do the heating.\n\nAnd in the US, no one drinks hot water\n\nPete Norton/Getty Warm weather calls for any measure to cool down.\n\nThe idea of yin and yang are part of the essence of the Chinese philosophy on health. If yin overtakes yang, you start to feel cold and could even catch a fever.\n\nThat\u2019s where hot water comes into play. It warms up the body and chases away the yin inside.\n\nHowever, in America, I see people drinking cold water and iced coffee all the time, even when it is 30 degrees outside. I was shocked when I saw it the first time and held on tighter to my hot latte.\n\nWhen it comes to education, American parents don\u2019t go to the same lengths as Chinese parents\n\nJohn Moore/Getty Images\n\nAmerican parents may think they take their children\u2019s education seriously, but it\u2019s even more drastic in China.\n\nChinese parents are known to purchase apartments near good schools just for their kids to have a chance to go to that school. The education marathon starts from pre-school all the way through high school.\n\nTo help their children get high scores on their high school and college exams, Chinese parents often spend extra money for their children to go to prep classes on the weekends or even hire a tutor to help them with their homework one-on-one. Famous teachers charge higher for a tutor class session, which averages at $US40 an hour in a class of 20 students.\n\nIn the US, I think children have more autonomy when it comes to what kind of school they choose to go and what kind of future they want to have. American parents may stress less on getting good grades, but they broaden their children\u2019s horizons by engaging in conversations about news and politics and participating in school projects with them.\n\nAnother difference is that parents in the US emphasise physical development to their kids more than Chinese parents do. Americans encourage their children to join sports teams and sign them up for athletic camps during the summer, which isn\u2019t as common where I\u2019m from.\n\nPeople in China scan QR codes to pay for stuff, from bus rides to luxury purses\n\nChesnot/Getty Images\n\nIn the US, when people go out to eat or shop, they either pay cash or card. Some apartment residents even pay their rent via check or money order. It wasn\u2019t until recently that mobile apps like PayPal and Venmo became a trendy way to pay.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case in China. People in China are catching up to the digital age in their own way: making transactions easier via QR codes.\n\nWith the prevalence of WeChat and Alibaba, nearly all vendors offer QR codes for customers to pay. Even the government has implemented the technology into public transportation in many cities in China by allowing people to pay for their fares via QR codes. One can link cards to WeChat Pay or AliPay and start scanning.\n\nThe US is way more spread out than China\n\nDoug Pensinger/Getty Images\n\nIf you look out the window of a plane in the US, you don\u2019t usually see clusters of houses everywhere, unless you\u2019re close to the airport. The US is roughly the same size as China, but has a much smaller population, which makes the US feel more spread out. The open space gives Americans a lot more opportunities to do outdoor activities like hiking and sailing.\n\nThe US has very different suburbs than China does\n\nHenryk Sadura/Shutterstock\n\nWhen you think of American suburbs, you might picture row after row of houses with big lawns, garages, backyards, and even swimming pools. There might be a shopping plaza or two nearby consisting of grocery stores, restaurants, cafes, banks and the like.\n\nSuburbs in China are very different \u2013 in fact, they don\u2019t look that different than cities in the US. Because of China\u2019s enormous population, suburbs there are filled with high-rise apartments and are connected to cities by buses, trains, and subways. Big houses are much more expensive in China because space is at a premium.\n\nRestaurants close early in the US\n\nAndy Cross/The Denver Post via Getty Images\n\nEverything closes pretty early in the towns I lived in, especially affordable dining places. Most restaurants usually close before 9 p.m. For party-goers and college students, they have limited choices like pizza or Waffle House or whatever they have in their fridge.\n\nIn China, people\u2019s food journeys are just beginning at 9 p.m. Vendors at the night markets usually sell from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m., and they have all kinds of options, from stir-fried crawfish to tofu pudding, all freshly made in front of you at affordable prices. Many vendors at popular night markets even stay open until dawn, meaning you can always find something to eat at any hour of the day.\n\nAmericans don\u2019t care about luxury and designer brands as much as Chinese people\n\nHanna Lassen/WireImage\n\nChinese people believe in clothing as an economic status symbol, and are much more keen to buy Chanel bags and Burberry trench coats than Americans, even though Americans have a much higher GDP per capita.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans tend to spend more on experiences like sporting events, concerts, and travelling.\n\nBut luxury goods are cheaper in the US\n\nChina charges high tariffs for imported goods, making luxuries even more expensive than they already are. For example, a Coach Parker Top Handle bag is $US350 plus tax on Coach\u2019s US website, while the same bag costs the equivalent of $US570 on Coach\u2019s Chinese website.\n\nPeople drive everywhere in America\n\nAmerica is a country on wheels. Except for in a few major cities, Americans drive everywhere: to school, to work, to shop, to eat, and everywhere in between. That leads to everything being more spread out. It\u2019s not crazy to drive for 30 minutes just to get to dinner.\n\nPeople might walk to destinations closer to home, but in many places public transportation is not a common way to get around. Buses might come every 30 minutes, or even every hour, and Amtrak trains are slow as well. Many Amtrak trains operate at speeds lower than 100 mph, whereas the high-speed trains in China can be as fast as 217 mph.\n\nMost Americans only speak one language \u2014 English\n\nAlthough a second language is required, most Americans are only fluent in English. Some may have taken Spanish or French in school and might have a vague knowledge of the language.\n\nIn China, you can expect people who have a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher to be able to read and write at least in intermediate English. In some Chinese provinces, people speak Mandarin as well as their local dialect. For example, most people in Guangdong province speak both Mandarin and Cantonese.\n\nVacations are longer in the US\n\nAmerican students usually get a three-month summer vacation and winter and spring breaks that last at least one or two weeks each. Thanksgiving break often extends for a week, too. And there are many one-day breaks such as MLK Day, Fourth of July, and Labour Day.\n\nChinese official holidays are usually shorter. Students get a 40-day vacation in both summer and winter. For working professionals, Spring Festival and National Day are the only two holidays that are one week long. Other holidays such as Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival are the only one-day vacations.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
