Photo: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Yeezy Season 3\n\nIf you think these past few months have taught us not to trust Kanye West, you haven\u2019t been paying attention. Sure, the Jesus Is King rollout has been rough and confusing, from when Kim Kardashian announced the project for her husband over Twitter to when September 29 came and passed with no new album. (In fact, we can\u2019t even be sure we\u2019ll get an album this Friday, October 25, either!) But to those who\u2019ve stayed loyal to Kanye in spite of all this, it\u2019s just the latest in a long line of botched rollouts, broken promises, and projects that never made it past their announcements.\n\nWe\u2019re not just talking about albums either (but where is Yandhi, anyway?) \u2014 it\u2019s the same story throughout Kanye\u2019s prolific film career. And while those among us who still have the desire after all this [waves hands] have been able to get our tickets to Jesus Is King the movie \u2014 the delayed album\u2019s companion IMAX film, which documents a Sunday Service filmed in James Turrell\u2019s Roden Crater, and opens in theaters Thursday night \u2014 we weren\u2019t lucky enough to see some of Kanye\u2019s other films. Here\u2019s a quick history of all his lost, forgotten, or abandoned visual projects.\n\n2007: HBO comedy series\n\nKanye West has called himself many things, so you\u2019ve probably forgotten that, in 2007, he deemed himself \u201cthe black Larry David.\u201d It came along with an announcement of a half-hour HBO comedy pilot inspired by Curb Your Enthusiasm, to be directed by former Seinfeld writer Larry Charles. They indeed turned in a pilot, although it was a full hour at first thanks to Kanye\u2019s addition of serious interviews with academics like Cornel West. (We\u2019re \u2026 curious.) It eventually got cut to 30 minutes, which HBO supposedly criticized for not having enough Kanye. (The rapper had Upright Citizens Brigade member Matt Besser teach him improv, but tended to let his cast members like J.B. Smoove and then-unknown Wyatt Cenac have the big moments.) So HBO didn\u2019t move forward with the project, but it did have exactly one full unofficial screening at Cenac\u2019s \u201cNight Train\u201d show in Brooklyn. The whole thing got taken off the internet, but the above (absurd) clip of Kanye meeting a Make-A-Wish kid is still intact on Vimeo as part of actor Alison Quinn\u2019s clip reel.\n\n2008: What Doesn\u2019t Kill Me\n\nAt the time, the Glow in the Dark tour was Kanye\u2019s most maximal live endeavor, with its hilly custom-designed set, setting up future tour stunts like Saint Pablo\u2019s floating stage. Not to mention, it was West\u2019s first headlining world tour, spanning April to December 2008. And just look at this list of openers: Lupe Fiasco, Nas, Santigold, N.E.R.D, and Rihanna (touring on Good Girl Gone Bad, no less!). Wish there were maybe some sort of filmed evidence of the whole thing? We do too \u2014 and apparently there is, we just may never get to see it. Complex pointed out last year that a trailer for a tour documentary called What Doesn\u2019t Kill Me, directed by Tobias Spellman, had quietly been uploaded to Vimeo. The five-minute clip shows behind-the-scenes footage of Kanye and his crew crisscrossing the country and in the studio, and gives a taste of the drama caused by the tour\u2019s ambitious design. There\u2019s no telling if we\u2019ll ever get the full cut (although, over a decade later, we\u2019d guess not), but hey, a trailer\u2019s something.\n\n2012: Cruel Summer\n\nthe steve jobs theater attempting to close in on @kanyewest \"surround vision\" 7-screen experience pic.twitter.com/d4JiGtqiMJ \u2014 Justin Staple (@justinstaple) March 25, 2019\n\nMost of the time, if a movie screens at Cannes Film Festival, it has hopes of ending up in theaters. Not so with Kanye\u2019s Cruel Summer, which he showed out of competition in 2012. Paired with the G.O.O.D. Music compilation album of the same name, it stars Kid Cudi as a car thief in love with a blind Arabian princess, who can only win her over by passing three challenges set up by her father. The real draw of the project, though, was its technology. Cruel Summer is now known for its seven-screen experience. Filmed with seven cameras at once, it\u2019s meant to be shown on seven screens: three in front, one on each side, one on the ceiling, and one on the floor. To accommodate this, Kanye contracted design firm 2x4 to construct a pyramid-shaped theater at Cannes. At the festival, Kanye promised to take his new installation on tour to New York City and Qatar (its setting). We\u2019re still waiting on that.\n\n2013: \u201cNew Slaves\ufeff\u201d\n\n2013 changed the album release as we know it, and not just because of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s surprise December release. Six months prior, Kanye West preceded the release of his long-awaited sixth album, Yeezus, with a black-and-white closeup video of his face as he performed \u201cNew Slaves\u201d projected onto 66 buildings worldwide. Thanks to dedicated Kanye fans who took video during the projections (because why would you not?), this stunt lives on online, even though Kanye never released the video properly. Another difference with this version? Kanye seems to sing his part of the outro without the heavy effects present on the album cut. And that falsetto needs to be archived!\n\n2014: Yeezus tour documentary\n\nTake note: We wouldn\u2019t trust Kanye if he announced another tour documentary. Six years after Glow in the Dark, he said he documented the Yeezus tour with a film, and this time actually released the trailer himself online \u2014 directed by frequent Kanye collaborator Hype Williams, no less! Supposedly, it was planned for a theatrical release but never made it, and judging by the lack of coverage of the film itself, it likely never screened. Around the same time Kanye announced the project, American Psycho writer and now-anti-political-correctness advocate Bret Easton Ellis said he was working on a movie with Ye, and we have to assume it was this. (He couldn\u2019t admit much, since the project was \u201cin Kanye Land,\u201d which is where we imagine many of these other films are sitting as well.)\n\n2015: \u201cAll Day\u201d/\u201dI Feel Like That\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something about Kanye video premieres and France. When it came time to debut the music video for \u201cAll Day,\u201d directed by Steve McQueen and also featuring unreleased song \u201cI Feel Like That,\u201d Kanye took it to the Louis Vuitton Foundation during Paris Fashion Week. McQueen shot the video just a week before, he said \u2014 a one-take of Kanye running around a nearly empty wood-paneled warehouse during \u201cAll Day,\u201d then sitting down to catch his breath for \u201cI Feel Like That.\u201d He officially premiered the video four months later at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, but never released it online. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s not out there if you know where to look (which we do).\n\n2016: \u201cOnly One\u201d video game\n\nAfter dozens of music videos and a handful of short films, Kanye wanted to branch out for his one-off song \u201cOnly One\u201d with a video game. The ballad itself is sung from the perspective of his deceased mom, and upon its 2015 release, he announced a game based off the song would follow. It wasn\u2019t just a random Kanye promise \u2014 a year later, at his Yeezy Season 3 event, where he debuted his new clothing line and album The Life of Pablo, he also premiered a trailer for the game. \u201cThe idea of the game is my mom traveling through the gates of heaven,\u201d he explained at the time. Since then, we haven\u2019t heard much on this project, and Business Insider reported in August 2017, \u201cSources we spoke with say \u2018Only One\u2019 hasn\u2019t been in active production since the summer of 2016. One source familiar with the project said that people working on the game were told at one point that funding for the project had fallen through.\u201d Reps for Kanye and game studio Encyclopedia Pictura said the project was still moving at the time, but we won\u2019t bet on getting a Kanye game on our phones anytime soon.\n\nTBD: A documentary about Kanye\u2019s life?\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that when GQ profiled Kim Kardashian for its 2016 \u201cLove, Sex, and Madness\u201d issue, we got this little detail from writer Caity Weaver: \u201cKim\u2019s husband commissions videographers to film everything when he\u2019s recording an album, for posterity (and possibly, one day, a documentary).\u201d Could a Kanye West life documentary one day hit theaters?
