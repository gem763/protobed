We don\u2019t need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas, & in fact have very few tankers there, but will help our Allies! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019\n\nThe attack is estimated to have removed 5.7 million barrels of oil from the market - a greater shock to the system than the Iranian revolution in 1979.\n\nThe Abquiq site processes 70 per cent of the entire country\u2019s oil output.\n\nFollowing the attack, Mr Trump wrote: \u201cSaudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!\u201d\n\nHis next tweet, written all in capital letters, simply said: \u201cPLENTY OF OIL!\u201d\n\nMore follows\u2026\n\n\n\n", "description": "Donald Trump has congratulated himself in a tweet claiming the US is \u201cnow the biggest energy producer in the world\u201d.\u201cThank you Mr President,\u201d he wrote in the tweet, which comes as global oil prices have risen following an attack on one of the world's largest oil refineries, in Saudi Arabia.", "authors": ["Harry Cockburn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/frGZy5SuU3w97tEEraRnPg--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/73d8aebb6e8eb62fbd58bdb39ea760cc", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
