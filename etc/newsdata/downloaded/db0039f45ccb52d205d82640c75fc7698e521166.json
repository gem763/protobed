(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nMIAMI \u2014 Terry McLaurin was in the midst of a career day, but late in the third quarter of the Washington Redskins\u2019 17-16 win over the Miami Dolphins, he wasn\u2019t happy.\n\nThe rookie wide receiver had carved up the Dolphins\u2019 secondary with some immaculate route-running and a pair of touchdowns that gave Washington a 14-3 lead, but on the play after Miami cut the deficit to 17-10, McLaurin had worked himself wide open for what would have been a 20-plus-yard gain, only to have a Case Keenum pass glance off his hands and fall to the ground as he turned upfield.\n\nDespite his frustration, the ever-calm, wise-beyond-his-years McLaurin soon made up for his mistake. After Miami downed a punt at Washington\u2019s one-yard line, the Redskins\u2019 offense found itself in the shadow of its own end zone with 4:41 left. McLaurin ran a post-corner route to get open for a 32-yard catch that moved the chains and provided valuable breathing room in a game Washington held onto win.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to make up for the one I didn\u2019t have,\u201d McLaurin said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want as a receiver. You\u2019re not necessarily going to make them all, but I try to train my mind to really let things go when things don\u2019t necessarily go my way and be ready for the next play. It\u2019s humbling, because you come from having a great game to dropping a ball that could really continue our drive.\u201d\n\n[The key moments from Redskins\u2019 17-16 win over the Dolphins in Miami]\n\nMcLaurin added: \u201cI think [route running] is what separates good receivers from great receivers. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m great yet, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m striving to be.\u201d\n\nA third-round pick in April\u2019s draft, McLaurin has grown into the top offensive weapon on Washington\u2019s roster, and the Redskins fed him the ball Sunday. He had seven targets, three more than any teammate, finishing with four catches for 100 yards and two touchdowns. The first score was a 25-yarder in which McLaurin ran inside before breaking to the outside, leaving Miami defensive back Ken Webster chasing after him. The second touchdown was a 33-yard fade from the slot in which McLaurin simply ran away from the defender.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impressive the type of poise that he has,\u201d interim coach Bill Callahan said. \u201cThe [fourth-quarter reception] was an art-form piece of work.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 offense has had trouble producing big plays dating back to last season, and McLaurin has been a pleasant surprise as a home-run hitter. He now has 50 yards receiving in every game he\u2019s played, and a touchdown in all but one. For a team that is lacking high-end players on its roster, McLaurin has established himself as a building block at wide receiver.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s friendly on the eyes, as a quarterback,\u201d quarterback Case Keenum said. \u201cJust the body language he gives in and out of breaks. I know where he\u2019s going to be at all times.\u201d\n\nRun game finds success, but quarterback play is still an issue\n\nCallahan swore that the Redskins would rededicate themselves to the run under his direction, and that\u2019s exactly what they did Sunday. Running back Adrian Peterson got work early and often, and came away with season-highs in attempts (23) and yards (118). His 25-yarder in the second half was his longest run of the year, and set up the first touchdown.\n\nThis is exactly what Callahan wants: more rushing attempts than the opponent. Washington had 33 rushes compared to Miami\u2019s 21.\n\n\u201cI was happy for [Peterson] to see that we could get him going and get him in a rhythm,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cYou see the competitive nature of him. He would take the ball every down if we gave it to him and he would produce.\u201d\n\nBut while the commitment to the running game is real, quarterback play remains an issue. Callahan said he saw enough from Keenum that he would continue being the starting quarterback moving forward, but the numbers weren\u2019t great. He finished 13 of 25 for 166 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions \u2014 although he came dangerously close to one on a play in which he scrambled in the second half. Keenum also continued to miss some open receivers, but the big throws he made to McLaurin were perfect.\n\nThe passing game will likely continue to be a work in progress, and some will continue to call for rookie Dwayne Haskins to start, but the success of the running game \u2014 albeit against a struggling Dolphins defense \u2014 offered some hope. If Washington can run the ball effectively and take advantage of some play-action fakes and one-on-one coverages, that could be a recipe for success.\n\nQuinton Dunbar is Washington\u2019s best cornerback\n\nJosh Norman gets more attention, and the bigger paycheck, but Dunbar continues to prove he\u2019s the top cornerback on the Redskins\u2019 roster. He recorded an interception against Miami when he jumped a route in the second quarter, his third in four games played.\n\nThe defense visibly suffered over the past two years when he missed time with injuries, and opponents have tested Norman more than him.\n\n\u201cJust film breakdown,\u201d Dunbar said of his recent success. \u201cReading concepts. Me playing receiver [previously] helps me out a lot with concepts and stuff like that. That\u2019s pretty much it. \u2026 Now that I\u2019m four years, five years in, I slow the game down tremendously.\u201d", "description": "Rookie wide receiver has established himself as a building block for Washington, while quarterback play remains a question mark.", "authors": ["Kareem Copeland", "Reporter Covering The Washington Redskins", "October At Pm", "Kareem Copeland Is The Post'S Washington Redskins Beat Writer.
