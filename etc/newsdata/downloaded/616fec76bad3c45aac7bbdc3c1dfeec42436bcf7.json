It sounds like a cruel move as Jean was taken aback when she got the sudden news that he had passed \u2013 but his heart was in the right place.\n\nKnowing that they could never have a future together due to his terminal diagnosis, Daniel assumed it would hurt Jean less to lose him now rather than down the line when she had fallen deeper for him. Thus, he enlisted the help of a mate to put on a false memorial service so that Jean could start to move on.\n\nTonight, Jean is set to get a surprise when she receives a video message from Daniel \u2013 but is he just furthering the guise that he is dead and saying a final farewell or has he had second thoughts and is about to reveal the truth that he is actually alive?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019re not sure how forgiving Jean would be if she found out that she had been tricked by Daniel but losing him has certainly hit him hard. Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami) was with her as she said her goodbyes so just as she is starting to get her head around everything, another reminder of Daniel could set her back.\n\nIt\u2019s a difficult time for Jean as she has been fighting cancer herself while also facing the loss of her daughter Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner), who has been forced to go on the run after brutally attacking Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden).\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, Mo Harris (Laila Morse) is hiding the secret that they could all soon be evicted as the landlords of the house are looking to sell the property.\n\nEastEnders continues on Monday 21st October at 8pm on BBC One.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Daniel has fooled Jean - until now?", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/daniel-and-jean-in-eastenders_1571649314.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
