It has no moral right to sit on these green benches,\" he said, prompting wild cheering and jeering.\n\n\"But the time is coming,\" he warned, his booming voice rising above the din. \"The time is coming, Mr. Speaker, when even these turkeys won't be able to prevent Christmas!\"\n\nThe government's message was, yes, it lost in the Supreme Court, the matter is settled, and so let's move on.\n\nBut move on to where?\n\nMost likely, the British Parliament will return to what it does best, which is disagree about Brexit.\n\nThe House of Commons recently voted against an immediate general election.,It has voted against then-Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal three times. It has opposed options dubbed no Brexit, hard Brexit and soft Brexit, and voted against staging a second referendum on whether to stay in the European Union or leave it. The only thing the lawmakers have agreed upon is that Britain will not leave the EU at the end of October without a proper withdrawal agreement - which is exactly what Mr Johnson threatens to do.\n\nEarlier this month, a so-called rebel alliance of politicians hastily passed legislation that requires Mr Johnson to ask the EU on Oct 19 for a three-month delay in implementing Brexit, if the two sides have not struck a deal.\n\nMr Johnson has vowed he will not seek a delay and repeatedly has promised that Britain will leave the European Union - deal or no deal, \"do or die\" - on Oct 31.\n\nThe numbers in Parliament do not suggest a way forward. Mr Johnson's Conservative Party government has lost its paper-thin majority and is running on fumes.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, told BBC Radio that Mr Johnson should apologize to the British public and to the queen, whose advice he sought in shuttering Parliament.\n\nBut Mr Corbyn added that he would not call for a vote of no confidence - which could lead to the government's downfall - until it is \"very clear\" that Britain will not careen out of the European Union at the end of October with no deal.\n\n\"He's proven time and again he can't be trusted,\" said Jo Swinson, leader of the ascendant Liberal Democrats, who have staked out a firm anti-Brexit stance.\n\nMs Swinson said politicians \"simply cannot afford to wait until the 19th of October to see whether or not the prime minister will refuse to obey the law again.\" She suggested that opposition politicians would try to find new ways to prevent a no-deal Brexit.\n\nIn a scathing editorial, the Financial Times, said it was \"refreshing that judges saw through Downing Street's skulduggery.\" The establishment newspaper called on Mr Johnson to step down.\n\n\"Faced with such a damning judgment, any premier with a shred of respect for British democracy and the responsibilities of his office would resign,\" the editorial said.\n\nDespite his devastating defeat at the Supreme Court, however, there were no signs that Mr Johnson was considering such a step.\n\n\"Anybody other than Johnson would surely resign immediately, but Johnson is not like any other prime minister in my lifetime,\" said Iain McLean, a senior research fellow at Oxford University.\n\nMr Johnson is not going anywhere, his aides say. Except Parliament, where he may appear Wednesday afternoon.\n\nWP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [LONDON] Prime Minister Boris Johnson flew home Wednesday to face a House of Commons filled with hooting and harrumphing lawmakers, as further calls rang out for his resignation, and Parliament reconvened to resume its seemingly endless quarreling over Brexit. .
