The earlier deadline was June 2019.\n\nIran in recent years has passed legislation to address money-laundering and terrorist-financing issues, but bills ratifying treaties related to combating these problems haven\u2019t come into force, the FATF said. The watchdog added that it considers only fully enacted legislation when reviewing a country\u2019s efforts.\n\nThe FATF this week put more pressure on Iran by asking countries to introduce enhanced processes for reporting financial transactions concerning the country. It also called for other countries to step up audit requirements for financial institutions that have branches or subsidiaries in Iran.\n\nThe international body warned that if Iran doesn\u2019t meet its standards by February, it will put back in place further restrictions on the country that are currently suspended. Further restrictions could make it more costly and difficult for Iran to do business with the banking systems of other FATF member states.\n\nRepresentatives at the Iranian mission to the United Nations didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cFor more than three years, Iran has repeated empty promises to the international community to stop financing terrorism and fix its corrupt and opaque financial system,\u201d Marshall Billingslea, an assistant U.S. Treasury secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes, said in a statement Friday. \u201cThe Financial Action Task Force has determined that enough is enough.\u201d\n\nThe FATF also added Iceland, Mongolia and Zimbabwe to its list, saying the jurisdictions don\u2019t fully comply with its standards. The countries, which are under FATF monitoring, have provided a high-level political commitment and have developed action plans to address the deficiencies, the international body said.\n\nThe watchdog kept Pakistan on the list, saying it lacked progress in completing an action plan to address what the FATF considered deficiencies related to counterterrorism financing. Ethiopia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia, meanwhile, were removed from the list.\n\nThe FATF said it has reviewed more than 80 countries and publicly identified 73 with deficiencies in their legal regimes. As of this month, 59 of the 73 countries have since made necessary overhauls and have been removed from the list, it said.\n\nWrite to Mengqi Sun at mengqi.sun@wsj.com", "description": "The Financial Action Task Force is increasing pressure on Iran to meet its standards while giving the country more time to do so.", "authors": ["Mengqi Sun", "Mengqi.Sun Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-118513/social", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
