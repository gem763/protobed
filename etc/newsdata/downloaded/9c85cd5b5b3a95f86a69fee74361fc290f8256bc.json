He wanted them to end slavery in America.\n\nIn his late seventies at the time, the former president said he was \u201ctoo old\u201d to take any action himself, a claim he first advanced in his forties, according to Mr Taylor.\n\nInstead, Mr Jefferson insisted, the up-and-coming generation should fix the problem by \u201cemancipating the enslaved and deporting them to Africa\u201d, Mr Taylor said.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to whiten Virginia,\u201d Mr Taylor said. \u201cHe believed the University of Virginia would help to achieve that.\u201d\n\nInstead, early graduates became \u201cleading voices in the pro-slavery movement, soldiers in the Confederate Army, and political leaders in the Confederate States of America,\u201d Ms McInnis wrote in Educated in Tyranny.\n\nThe vast majority of the student body \u2013 numbering between 100 and 150 people each year \u2013 hailed from wealthy, southern slaveholding families.\n\nPlantation-owning parents clamoured to send their sons to the University of Virginia, lauded as a prestigious alternative to the northern schools they feared as dangerous hotbeds of anti-slavery sentiment, according to Mr Taylor.\n\nUltra-rich southerners were also some of the only Americans able to afford tuition at the university, then \u201cthe most expensive college\u201d in the country, Mr Taylor said.\n\nThe design of its grounds and buildings \u2013 featuring \u201cincredible segregation of student-faculty-white space and enslaved-African-American-work space\u201d \u2013 ultimately reinforced vile theories of white supremacy employed to justify slavery, Ms McInnis said in an interview.\n\n\u201cJefferson physically designed a campus that internalised everything he had learned living on plantations,\u201d Ms McInnis said. \u201cIt is architecturally set up to be a landscape of slavery.\u201d\n\nThe University of Virginia had one real rule about enslaved people \u2013 students were not allowed to bring any to campus.\n\nIn part, professors feared the student body would compete to see who could arrive with the most enslaved servants, straining the school\u2019s resources, Mr Taylor said.\n\nBesides, the university already had a significant labour force \u2013 usually between 100 and 200 enslaved servants, about half of them women, according to Ms McInnis.\n\nThe enslaved helped build almost every inch of the university, from its deep brick cellars to its soaring white columns.\n\nOnce students arrived, the university\u2019s enslaved cooked their meals, cleaned their rooms, washed their clothes, tended fires in dormitories, planted and cared for the school gardens, and maintained classrooms and outhouses, Mr Taylor said.\n\nEnslaved people also catered to students\u2019 daily whims.\n\n\u201cEvery afternoon, an enslaved servant called on his assigned student,\u201d Mr Taylor wrote in Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Education. The enslaved person then \u201c[took] orders for errands on the grounds or in town\u201d.\n\nThey also had to obey the sometimes conflicting dictates of every student or professor they passed on campus, Ms McInnis said.\n\nThis meant having \u201cnot one master but hundreds ... making navigating daily life fraught with peril,\u201d she wrote in Educated in Tyranny.\n\nThrough it all, the enslaved faced unchecked abuse from the privileged pupils they served.\n\nSometimes \u201cbored students\u201d played \u201ccruel pranks\u201d \u2013 tricks such as \u201csetting buckets of cold water atop a door to douse a servant entering to clean\u201d, Mr Taylor wrote.\n\nOther times, students nearly beat the enslaved to death, including one who looked \u201cuppity\u201d while serving food, Mr Taylor said, and another who was slightly too slow to clear away faeces left behind by a student\u2019s dog.\n\nSchool records reveal students punching, kicking and mutilating enslaved people with canes.\n\nSome, frustrated with the pace of service in campus dining halls, threw knives at their enslaved waiters, according to Ms McInnis.\n\nOnce, a student convinced that an enslaved girl had spoken to him \u201cwith insolence\u201d beat and kicked the 10-year-old until \u201cshe passed out and a physician had to be called,\u201d Ms McInnis said.\n\nAt the University of Virginia \u2013 as at every southern university in America during this era \u2013 bullying the enslaved formed \u201cpart of daily existence,\u201d Ms McInnis said.\n\nIt was also performance art, Mr Taylor added, a way for rich young men to prove their mettle to their peers.\n\n\u201cThe episodes we do know of, other students are watching and applauding,\u201d Mr Taylor said. \u201cThis was a whole generation of men who just behaved monstrously.\u201d\n\nEnslaved women, as Ms McInnis wrote in her book, were at special risk.\n\nRapes were routine, whether conducted in nearby houses of prostitution staffed by enslaved women or in the dark alleyways and shady corners of campus.\n\nStudents, who arrived in Charlottesville steeped in a plantation culture of sexual tyranny, felt the \u201censlaved women working at the university were just one of the \u2018Virginian Luxuries\u2019 they had a right to,\u201d Ms McInnis wrote.\n\nIt can be difficult to track sexual assaults in the archives, Ms McInnis said, because squeamish faculty often used euphemisms.\n\nStill, the few cases available are haunting, she said \u2013 like the time three students seized a \u201csmall negro girl ... about 12 years old\u201d, per university records, dragged her to an out-of-the-way cemetery and raped her.\n\nMost of the time, professors \u201cdid nothing\u201d or referred the matter to local authorities, who also did nothing, according to Ms McInnis.\n\nOccasionally, faculty members might deliver \u201cverbal admonishments\u201d, she wrote. Meanwhile, professors commonly dismissed students for failing to wear the prescribed school uniform.\n\nNo calls for discipline came from the school\u2019s founder, either.\n\nIt\u2019s probable that Jefferson knew about students\u2019 brutalisation of the enslaved, according to Mr Taylor.\n\nAs a slave owner himself, Jefferson knew that slavery everywhere \u2013 including at his cherished college \u2013 led to violence against the enslaved, Mr Taylor said.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s nothing in the record from him,\u201d Mr Taylor said. \u201cFrankly, Jefferson does not want to see or think about it ... you know, \u2018See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\u2019.\u201d\n\nMr Taylor said he knows many Americans will find the revelations about student behaviour horrifying. But books like his and Ms McInnis\u2019 are necessary at this political and cultural moment, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a broad understanding that \u2018slavery is bad, people got whipped,\u2019 but there\u2019s also an urge to compartmentalise it: \u2018That was bad, but it\u2019s over with, and we should focus on the good stuff like U-Va.\u2019s cutting-edge education and science\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to ruin people\u2019s day \u2013 but if you want to understand society, you\u2019ve got to understand how everything is woven together, the good with the bad.\u201d\n\nWashington Post", "description": "The two young, white University of Virginia students had a secret.
