They won't actually go to university to study, it's just a reason to be in a particular place.\"\n\nImage caption Dr Mohammed Qasim infiltrated a county lines gang in Swansea as part of his research\n\nThe organisation that represents colleges in Wales said they work with authorities to \"meet any challenges county lines gangs might pose\", while universities are not commenting.\n\nDr Qasim met young county lines drug runners working out of a \"really nice flat\" in Swansea earlier this year and they wanted to set up their own \"franchise\" running drugs to Aberystwyth.\n\n\"One was kicked out of school, he didn't have much going on in his life in London but in Swansea he was making money,\" he said.\n\n\"He was away from gang crime, he'd been given a flat. I'd imagine you pay \u00a31,100 a month in the city for a flat like that.\n\n\"He had five or six people living in a one bedroom flat back in London, so living in this apartment here was like heaven.\n\n\"These were victims of exploitation from older gang members. They put them into these cities, sell them the dream that they can make money and eventually set up their own operations.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThis 47-year-old addict gets his drugs from county lines dealers\n\n\"When the English guys first appeared on the scene, we didn't like it. We're proud Welsh and I didn't like buying from them at all.\n\n\"We were really angry about them bringing crack into the area. We didn't have that here before and it's so destructive for people - they just don't care.\n\n\"The people I dealt with were Birmingham youngsters but I didn't like having to pick up off 17-year-olds - I'm 45.\n\n\"I know a couple that tried to rip them off and steal from them and this boy just pulled a machete - you could see from the look in his eye he would have taken their arm off if they'd gone for the drugs.\"\n\nPolice say young runners, often victims of child exploitation, are told by dealers to swallow the drugs to transport around the county as it is more difficult for officers to carry internal searches on children.\n\n\"That's partly to make the police response more difficult as we don't want to be keeping young people in detention longer than necessary,\" said Det Insp Paul Stanley of British Transport Police.\n\n\"And partly to reduce the risk of them being located.\"\n\nDealers are said to operate a \"marketing machine\" and offer credit to addicts in order to lure them into taking drugs.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption County lines drug dealers text potential customers offering cut-price deals on heroin and crack cocaine\n\nCounty lines gangs have a widespread marketing network, texting potential customers offering cut-price deals on heroin and crack cocaine.\n\n\"We see guys in treatment who are trying really hard to move away from the scene but you literally have people knocking on their doors,\" said Carly Jones of drug awareness organisation PSALT.\n\n\"We always say to people in treatment is get rid of your phone, change your number, get a fresh start.\n\n\"We have tens of people saying that's what they did, but within two weeks they have someone knocking on their door saying here's \u00a350 credit on us, trying to hook them back in.\n\n\"It feels like we're drowning in street drugs at the moment and I think there's worse to come.\"\n\nSorry, your browser cannot display this map\n\nThe map above used a statistical model to classify areas that have experienced a significant change in drug crime. Weight is given to areas with a strong overall trend of increasing or decreasing crime across several years. Where there is no strong overall pattern in a particular location, those areas have been labelled as having \"no change\".\n\nDrug crime refers to drug-related incidents reported to or identified by the police that an officer classes as criminal, whether or not the crime results in a charge.\n\nTap here if you can't see the interactive map above", "description": "Gang members enrol in universities and masquerade as students \"to have an alibi\".", "authors": ["Will Fyfe", "Bbc Wales News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p067fr9x.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
