(Photo: YouTube)\n\nMillie Bobby Brown is the latest celebrity to get involved in the beauty and skincare industry after launching her own vegan line called Florence by Mills. Just nearly a month after the launch, however, the 15-year-old is getting backlash for allegedly faking a nighttime routine with the products.\n\nAccording to a Reddit thread, the video first appeared on the brand\u2019s IGTV before it was quickly deleted. An archived version still exists on YouTube.\n\nThere, tens of thousands of people have watched the Stranger Things actress show off some of her products, including a face mist, scrub, wash and moisturizer. However, many have said that it looks like Brown isn\u2019t actually using them.\n\nIn fact, critics continue to comment on the YouTube video to point out that the teen is wearing makeup throughout it \u2014 as is evident by her black eyeliner \u2014 which doesn\u2019t budge throughout her routine. Her complexion doesn\u2019t look cleansed or moisturized from the various products or even wet from when she allegedly rinsed them off.\n\n\u201cShe literally didn't apply anything... if she was actually applying something then all her makeup would be smudging and coming off,\u201d one person wrote. Another commented, \u201csis just rubbed air on her face.\u201d\n\nVideo: Millie Bobby Brown\u2019s Style Evolution\n\nOthers made comments about how the routine wasn\u2019t done in the correct order in the first place. But, most simply questioned why the video was posted when it was blatantly fake.\n\n\u201cIs this a prank?\u201d someone asked on Reddit. \u201cTrying to think of why this video would even exist. Like maybe she sent someone some sort of mock up of what the video would look like before actually filming using the products?? Honestly I'm completely perplexed.\u201d\n\nViewers compared the flop to a sponsored video made by Pretty Little Liars actress Shay Mitchell where she was allegedly using Bior\u00e9 cleansing water to remove her eye makeup. And although there seemed to be black mascara on the cotton pad that she showed off to the camera, people said that the pad hadn\u2019t even touched Mitchell\u2019s eye.\n\nSHE AINT EVEN ACTUALLY RUB HER EYE IM CRYING LMFAOOOO pic.twitter.com/JVbWbg5P1i \u2014 jor \ud83e\udd8b (@ohjlizzle) September 9, 2018\n\n\u201cThis is giving me shay mitchell flashbacks...\u201d a YouTube commenter wrote on Brown\u2019s video.\n\nFlorence by Mills didn\u2019t immediately respond to Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s request for comment.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
