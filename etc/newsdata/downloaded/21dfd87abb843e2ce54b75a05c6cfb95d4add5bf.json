A judge on Sunday granted her bail but ordered that she stay in custody until a related probation hearing.\n\nHartman's arrest marks the latest chapter in a story that's played out for a decade at airports across the U.S., including last year when she was arrested after sneaking on a flight from O'Hare to London.\n\nShe ultimately pleaded guilty to criminal trespassing and was sentenced in March to 18 months' probation after agreeing to stay away from Chicago's two commercial airports.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
