These are environmental friendly. We had appealed to our scientists to come up with an alternative to the polluting fire crackers so that people's sentiments are taken care of without harming the environment,\" said Vardhan.\n\nThe crackers are available at lower cost due to the change in composition.\n\n\"The green crackers will be available at a cheaper price. It will not be more than the existing ones. The composition of the chemicals has changed which has reduced their cost,\" said Sadhana Rayalu, chief scientist and head of environmental materials divison, CSIR-NEERI.\n\nIn 2018, the Supreme Court had banned manufacturing of polluting firecrackers and ruled that only green crackers with reduced emission will be allowed to be sold in the country in order to control the pollution level. The decision came right before Diwali when stubble burning in the regions on Haryana and Punjab had drastically reduced the air quality in the national capital and surrounding regions.\n\nBCCL\n\nHowever, most sellers were left clueless about green firecrackers.\n\nFarmers setting ablaze crop residue and the bursting of firecrackers during the festival of Diwali can cost the economy up to $190 billion (Rs 13 lakh crore), or 1.7 per cent of India\u2019s GDP, over the next five years, says a study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology.\n\nThe loss is in terms of human cost. The study says that residents of India\u2019s capital, New Delhi, and the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana together lose 19.2 million healthy man years due to stubble burning and firecrackers.", "description": "\u2018Green\u2019 firecrackers with 30 per cent less emissions are now available in the markets.
