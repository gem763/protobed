He was supposed to be the club's superstar player, but instead he's been a massive waste of money.\n\nThe French giant paid $250 million for the Brazilian, who signed a five year, $784,000-per-week contract, becoming the world's second highest paid player behind Carlos Tevez.\n\nSince the move, the 27-year-old has scored 51 goals in 58 games, won the Ligue 1 Player of the Year award, and helped PSG to consecutive Ligue 1 titles.\n\nIt may seem a decent return on the pricey Paulistano investment on paper, but the player has been absent, ineffective, and extremely expensive.\n\nPSG has not gotten value for money out of Neymar\n\nNeymar's 71 goals and assists in Ligue 1 and the Champions League over the past two seasons put him amongst the top ten contributors in Europe's top five leagues.\n\nBut the cost of those contributions against his weekly salary makes Neymar's efforts seem meek, especially in comparison to his peers from other leagues like Lionel Messi at FC Barcelona, Cristiano Ronaldo at Juventus, and Mohamed Salah at Liverpool FC.\n\nShayanne Gal/Business Insider\n\nNeymar's exorbitant salary means he has cost PSG $1.15 million for every goal or assist this season. To put this in perspective, Ronaldo totalled 86 goals or assists in the same period, averaging a cost of $927,000 per contribution with Real Madrid, then Juventus.\n\nBarcelona forward Messi was the most effective forward in Europe over the last two campaigns, managing 110 goals/assists at a cost of $595,000 each \u2014 but Liverpool's Mo Salah proved the best value for money.\n\nThe Egyptian scored 69 goals and provided 29 assists for Jurgen Klopp's side, but given his comparatively small wage packet, each one cost Liverpool $199,000 \u2014 almost a sixth of what each contribution from Neymar cost PSG.\n\nThe Brazilian's strikes also counted for little\n\nNeymar also had minimal impact on PSG's final standing in Ligue 1.\n\nNeymar's contributions in Ligue 1 earned PSG just nine points in each of the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 campaigns. What this means is simple. Even without Neymar, the Parisians would still have won the league title in both seasons.\n\nWhile not on the chart below, his contributions in Champions League games also made no difference \u2014 take them away, and PSG still go out at the Round of 16 in both years.\n\nAgain, compare that to Ronaldo, Messi and Salah, and it shows how horribly ineffective Neymar has been.\n\nShayanne Gal/Business Insider\n\nRonaldo managed to secure 39 league points for Madrid and Juventus. Without his offerings, both sides would have slipped significantly down their respective tables \u2014 Juventus to second, and Madrid to seventh.\n\nThe Portuguese also had a big impact in the Champions League, with his exploits proving pivotal in Madrid winning the trophy in the 2017-2018 season, and his hat-trick against Atletico Madrid for Juventus last season helping carry the Italians to the quarterfinals.\n\nRead more: Jadon Sancho, a 19-year-old who has been compared to Neymar, is now worth far more than the declining Paris Saint-Germain super forward\n\nSalah provided an equally impressive contribution for Liverpool. Without him, they would have finished seventh in the Premier League rather than second in the 2017-2018 campaign. And, rather than winning the Champions League last season, Liverpool would have been eliminated in the group stages.\n\nFinally, without Lionel Messi's impressive points contribution of 53, Barcelona would have finished fourth and fifth in La Liga rather than winning back-to-back titles, and in Europe, while the Catalans failed to win anything, they would have suffered a lot worse without the Argentine's help, going out one, and then two rounds earlier.\n\nRonaldo, Messi and Salah have been essential to the successes their respective teams enjoyed. Neymar, for all the money he has cost, has been irrelevant.\n\nIt pays to be injured ...\n\nPSG has played 92 competitive games in the French league and in Europe over the past two seasons. Neymar has missed 42 of them.\n\nHe missed 38 matches through injury. The Brazilian has suffered a number of serious knocks since joining PSG, including a broken metatarsal, adductor problems, and another foot injury last season.\n\nPSG has spent $29.8 million on his wages while he's been injured. Though this may have been paid through an insurer, it could have bumped up the club's premium regardless.\n\nAdd in the four games he's been suspended for, and the figure increases to $32.9 million.\n\nShayanne Gal/Business Insider\n\nRonaldo has also earned $14.35 million whilst injured, however that is still less than half of what PSG paid Neymar. Messi has earned $5.5 million on the sidelines, while Salah has taken home only $564,000 \u2014 proving again he is the best value for money forward in Europe.\n\nThe end is not in sight however\n\nPSG sporting director Leonardo admitted his desire for Neymar to leave the club earlier this summer.\n\n\"Neymar can leave PSG if there is an offer that suits everyone,\" he told Le Parisian.\n\nHe added: \"PSG wants to rely on players who want to stay and build something big. We do not need players who would do a favour at the club by staying here.\"\n\nThe club's president, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, has also hinted at his desire for the Brazilian to move on, saying: \"I want players willing to give everything to defend the honour of the jersey and join the club project.\n\n\"Those who do not want to, or do not understand, we see each other and talk about it.\"\n\nOne thing remains in the way of Neymar leaving PSG however, that nobody is willing to pay for him.\n\nRead more: Nobody wants to buy the world's top soccer players because they're overpaid and too old and could be a gigantic waste of money\n\nFormer club Barcelona and its Spanish rival Real Madrid have been heavily linked with a move for the 27-year-old over the summer, but with PSG unwilling to budge on it's $200 million asking price, neither are ready to pay club record fees for an injury prone and out-of-form player.\n\nSky Sports reported Saturday that talks about a last minute move to Bar\u00e7a had broken down and Neymar would be staying with PSG until the end of his contract, which only expires in 2022.\n\nIf past form and injury record is anything to go by, Neymar will end up costing PSG so much more.", "description": "Paris Saint-Germain has spent $33 million on Neymar when he's been injured, sidelined, or suspended.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d692f232e22af46921bb8ee-1920-960.jpg"}
