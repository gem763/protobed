There\u2019s nothing to learn from the Germans; we did too little and too late.\u2019 And there is something paradoxical about saying: \u2018Well, we committed this terrible crime, but weren\u2019t we great at coming to terms with it?\u2019 You can\u2019t really say that. But someone who\u2019s a semi-outsider as I am, can, in fact, say that.\u201d\n\nNeiman, a moral philosopher, spent part of her childhood in the American south and she has written a comparative study of how Germany has come to terms with the crimes of nazism, and why the US, in failing to confront its own human rights abuses, should take note. Ambitious and detailed, it ranges from the initial reluctance of German citizens to begin the process of truth and reconciliation to small-town Mississippi, and the shooting of nine African American churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, four years ago.\n\nIt was that massacre, carried out by a white supremacist, that prompted Neiman, whose previous books include an examination of the concept of evil, to begin researching and writing Learning from the Germans. From her home in Berlin, where she has lived for the past 22 years, Neiman watched Barack Obama give a heartrending eulogy to the dead, and then followed as governors began to order the taking down of Confederate flags, and Walmart announced that it would stop selling Confederate memorabilia. It struck her that amid the horror lurked a hopeful moment \u2013 a moment of potential change \u2013 and that she herself had \u201csome knowledge and experience that I could share, that might be helpful\u201d.\n\nNeiman\u2019s mother campaigned for the desegregation of Atlanta\u2019s public schools \u2013 an activity that earned her, as Neiman recalls, several late-night phone calls from the Ku Klux Klan. One hot summer\u2019s day, her mother invited an African American friend and her children over for the afternoon, and Neiman asked if they could all go to the outdoor swimming pool. No, came the answer. The lake, then? Still no. Imploring and questioning did not change the answer. In the end, the children played beneath the garden sprinklers; only years later did Neiman realise that it would have been against the law for them to have swum together.\n\nIn early adulthood, Neiman went to Berlin to study Kant, leaving just before the wall came down in 1989; after a period at Yale and a return to Berlin, she spent five years living in Tel Aviv, arriving after the Oslo peace agreement and leaving before the second intifada. She smiles wryly at her strange sense of historical timing, but the underlying point is that she has lived in a succession of places in which the past lies heavy on the present. And, perhaps even more crucially, she has done so with an outsider\u2019s perspective and the distance to ask difficult questions. (We meet in rural Ireland because she lives here, in a remote coastal town, for three months of each year, which she devotes entirely to writing; her next book is a novel.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marchers commemorate the lives lost in a shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, 2015.

And it\u2019s very important to look at particular histories. But you can certainly get an idea of: number one, how hard it is; number two, that it\u2019s nevertheless possible; and number three, that a country can come out much better on the other side. It can be a source of strength and not weakness.\u201d\n\nNeiman does not stint on impressing on her readers the details of number one, drawing on a vast body of interviews \u2013 half, she estimates, didn\u2019t even make it into the book \u2013 to explore how long history\u2019s tail is. It is too easy, she argues, to believe that as soon as the second world war ended, Germany set about the process of atoning for its crimes. It simply isn\u2019t so: after all, 10% of the country\u2019s population had been members of the Nazi party, \u201cand the most shocking, but also important thing, is they were not the uneducated masses. The majority had academic degrees. We like to think that education provides immunity to racist and fascist ideology. And it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhat, then, heralded the start of Germans en masse beginning to face the past? Although some of it can be explained generationally, she replies, as people died off, \u201cthat won\u2019t do the trick, as we\u2019ve seen in the United States. And as we\u2019ve seen in Britain where, you know, time has gone by, and people like falling back on national myths of greatness.\u201d In part, she believes the Auschwitz trials marked a moment of change in which the burgeoning of mass travel connected ordinary Germans with other worldviews and there was an emergence of books by Holocaust survivors. She also notes the importance of 1968, \u201ca moment for confronting parents and teachers \u2026 and there was a sense of a sudden real wave of disgust and rebellion: what have you done?\u201d\n\nNeiman is also at pains to point out that this work was done more quickly and more effectively in East Germany \u2013 much of which went unnoticed because of the relentless focus on West German attempts at rehabilitation. \u201cWhenever you say anything good about East Germany,\u201d she says, \u201cimmediately somebody jumps up and says, \u2018My God, you\u2019re a Stalinist \u2026 \u2019 I\u2019m not defending everything about it, of course. But I laboured on the chapter that talks about the east. I fact-checked it; I had somebody else fact-check it. I knew that I was going to get a lot of flak for that. But in the beginning, East Germany did a better job. They just did. On every level: in terms of bringing old Nazis to trial, in terms of teaching the period in schools, in terms of building monuments, and restoring concentration camps and making them educational.\u201d Meanwhile, the west was so busy fighting a new conflict \u2013 \u201cold Nazis were the best people to fight the cold war\u201d \u2013 that efforts at serious denazification went by the board.\n\nAs one might expect from a philosopher \u2013 especially one who has side-stepped the academy to work across disciplines \u2013 Neiman is fascinating and potent on how the Holocaust has functioned on multiple planes, and primarily as an example of pure evil that, by consequence, allows other societies to divert attention from their own misdeeds. \u201cNothing else even comes close to it. And if you haven\u2019t done that, well, then you\u2019re doing fairly well \u2026 you know, it\u2019s as if we would like to have a large black hole that says, this is where you put evil and we don\u2019t have to look at it.\u201d\n\nShe has, she says, been shocked by the lack of knowledge in Britain about the Nazi period, which naturally leads us into a conversation about the fondness of rightwing politicians for invoking the glories of the war, \u201cthis nostalgia for the empire that you see all over the place with Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg and I suppose Boris Johnson too ... As if the empire really was a wonderful thing, as if it brought nothing but civilisation to the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nThis nostalgia that you see \u2013 it\u2019s as if the British empire brought nothing but civilisation to the rest of the world\n\nShe started to write the book before Donald Trump and before Brexit, and there have been times when she has felt \u201cquite despairing\u201d about whether her contribution will be of any practical use. But she has got over that. When I remark that prejudice appears to become more and more entrenched, she counters that the resistance to that prejudice is also growing.\n\n\u201cWhat one can simply do is strengthen the voices, and say it is absolutely time that we come to terms with parts of our past, we can\u2019t sweep them under the rug. And it\u2019s possible to come out the other side. It\u2019s not the case that all a country needs to do is beat its breast and talk about its failures and its crimes, which is, of course, what the right always accuses people on the left of doing. But if you don\u2019t do that, you get explosions of things, like the kind of nationalism and racism that we\u2019ve seen in so many countries lately.\u201d\n\nIn Germany, she says, there has been anxiety about the regional elections and the growth of rightwing nationalism; but she doesn\u2019t believe the movement is so widespread as to become a problem in the way that Brexit is in the UK, or Marine Le Pen in France, Matteo Salvini in Italy or Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski in Poland. And in terms of the US, while they are not flying swastikas in Bavaria, she notes, they are flying Confederate flags in the south, encouraged by an administration that is quite happy to foster hatred and demonisation of the other.\n\nIn the course of writing the book, Neiman met and interviewed vast numbers of activists and citizens in the American south. One of the key questions she wanted the book to ask was, if we insist on saying that we have to remember the Holocaust in order to learn from it, then what do we want to learn? \u201cAnd what it seems to me we can learn is, be aware of the beginnings. Be aware of racism, be aware of nationalism. The Nazis went very slowly and carefully to see what the population would accept.\u201d\n\nThe idea of the long tail kept returning, and with it the fact that slavery did not end with the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. Slavery in the US continued by other means for at least 90 years, she argues, and was sometimes even more brutal than the previous regimes. Men were deprived of their liberty by, for example, the invention of the crime of vagrancy, which was used to arrest African Americans and put them to work in mines and in factories, often with the collusion of the police.\u201cIf you start looking at the history between the Emancipation Proclamation, and Rosa Parks and the Montgomery bus boycott, it was neo-slavery or an age of racist terror rather than Jim Crow, which is a name that a lot of African Americans are rejecting. It\u2019s just too harmless to describe what was actually happening.\u201d\n\nWhat African Americans are currently withstanding \u2013 radically poorer health outcomes and inequality in education, judicial and incarceration systems, and police brutality directed predominantly towards young black men \u2013 is, Neiman argues, part and parcel of white America\u2019s inability to face up to its past, and to the crimes it has committed against African Americans and Native Americans. Only, she says, when you decide to be an adult can you begin to effect change.\n\n\u201cI really do see that our relationship to our nation is like a grown-up relationship to our parents. We have to sort this through and say: \u2018These parts of my national history I can be proud of and I can stand by, and these parts I\u2019m sorry for and I\u2019d like to do my best to somehow make up for.\u2019 And I think, once you go through a process like that, you can begin to have a kind of healthy nationalism or patriotism. Which isn\u2019t that my country is better than all countries. But it\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Learning from the Germans: Confronting Race and the Memory of Evil by Susan Neiman is published by Allen Lane (\u00a320).
