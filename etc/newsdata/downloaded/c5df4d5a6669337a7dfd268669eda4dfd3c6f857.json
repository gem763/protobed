They responded with teargas, rubber and foam bullets and a water cannon.\n\nOfficers were criticised for being heavy-handed and Catalan health authorities say four people were blinded in one eye by rubber bullets. One police officer and one protester remain in a critical condition.\n\nPlay Video 1:27 Catalonia protests: key moments from a week of unrest \u2013 video\n\nCarmen Calvo, the deputy prime minister in Spain\u2019s socialist caretaker government, defended its response to the violence as \u201cvery proportional\u201d, adding that it was keen to avoid the kind of scenes of police brutality that greeted the unilateral Catalan independence referendum of 2017.\n\nShe said the government was doing everything in its power to make sure the situation did not escalate further. \u201cWe\u2019re trying not to make any mistakes now that would hinder future political negotiations within the constitution,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most responsible but complicated and difficult position.\u201d\n\nCalvo said the pro-independence Catalan president, Quim Torra, was an activist who had never understood that he was meant to be the president of all Catalans, including the half who oppose independence.\n\nShe said Torra was inflaming the situation by not condemning the violence by a minority of demonstrators strongly enough, and by now threatening to hold another unilateral and illegal independence referendum.\n\n\u201c[He] needs to stop telling impossible lies \u2013 like that there will be a Catalan constitution in spring, or that Catalonia will have separated from Spain by spring,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe independence movement\u2019s biggest problem politically is that they\u2019ve lied to the Catalan people. They said this referendum was legal and would bring about a break [from Spain]. They told them the split was possible, that the right to self-determination exists in a democracy like Spain \u2013 which is a total lie. There\u2019s no right to unilateral separation in this democracy nor any other.\u201d\n\nShe said the government had already engaged in talks with Torra before the supreme court announced its verdict and would be happy to do so as soon as he condemned the violence unconditionally and \u201cstopped lying\u201d about independence.\n\nThe deputy prime minister also accused the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) and centre-right Citizens party of stoking tensions with Catalonia over recent years and leaving the socialist government to deal with the fallout.\n\nIn Catalonia on Sunday, after a week of violent clashes, the seventh consecutive night of protests over the imprisonment of Catalan leaders passed off peacefully with only around 2,000 taking to the streets of Barcelona. Some roads were blocked and there was a sit-down demonstration outside police headquarters, but no reports of serious incidents.\n\nBoth the PP and Citizens have called for the government to take a much tougher line on the unrest in Catalonia and accused it of being too lenient with separatist leaders. Spain is due to hold its fourth general election in as many years on 10 November.\n\nThe independence movement gathered support and momentum under the previous PP government of Mariano Rajoy.\n\nWhen the former Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, tried to break away from Spain by holding an unilateral referendum and subsequently declaring independence, Rajoy responded by sacking Puigdemont\u2019s administration and taking direct control of Catalonia.\n\n\u201cWhat this government is doing is dealing with the disastrous legacy they\u2019ve left us with,\u201d said Calvo. \u201cIt\u2019s one of agitation and the absolute abandonment of real politics.\u201d\n\nShe said that Citizens, which has been among the most fierce opponents of the regional independence movement, had sought to drive a wedge between Spain and Catalonia.\n\nNew generation, new tactics: the changing face of Catalan protests Read more\n\n\u201cIf you want Catalonia to be in Spain, the last thing you should be doing is creating confrontation,\u201d said Calvo. \u201cI hope they\u2019re punished at the polls for the level of irresponsibility, disloyalty and selfishness they\u2019ve shown the country.\u201d\n\nAsked about police actions over the past few days and videos purporting to show officers attacking innocent bystanders, Calvo insisted the police response had been planned and measured. She added: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen images that we wouldn\u2019t have wanted to see, but we haven\u2019t seen the kind of images we saw [on the day of the referendum two years ago].\u201d\n\nThe deputy prime minister said video clips did not always reflect the precise circumstances of every incident. When pressed on whether the law applied to everyone in Spain whether they wore a uniform or not, she said: \u201cThe law applies equally to everyone in this country.\u201d\n\nFurther protests are expected in the coming days.", "description": "Carmen Calvo says Quim Torra should go further in condemning violence by separatist protesters", "authors": ["Sam Jones", "Stephen Burgen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac23fdb3d4b94bab78ea33d91e9d881da7f033f2/0_92_5321_3192/master/5321.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cfe220e1b23d41e7eed924f7a2750617", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
