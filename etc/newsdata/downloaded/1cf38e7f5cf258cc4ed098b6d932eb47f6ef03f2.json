No incumbent could survive in these conditions.\u201d\n\nMr Gedan added that Mr Fernandez is \u201can untested leader\u201d who is inheriting a ruinous economy and unfavourable international conditions.\n\n\u201cThe government of Alberto Fernandez and Cristina Kirchner will feature Peronists of varied political tendencies, but the crucial question is what the dynamic will be between the pragmatic president and more ideological and polarising vice president,\u201d Michael Shifter, the head of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank, said.\n\n\u201cThe nature of that power struggle will determine the direction of Argentina's economic, social and foreign policy in coming years.\u201d\n\nHowever, Mr Shifter did not believe a return to the populist policies of Ms Kirchner\u2019s presidency was likely.\n\n\u201cToday, Argentina simply does not have the economic conditions for unchecked spending,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis will not be a replay of her presidency.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by AP\n\nRead more\n\nLeftist candidate favoured to oust conservative incumbent in Argentina\n\nBrazil sends in troops amid anger at failure to tackle vast oil spill\n\nBolsonaro poll rating plummets in Brazil over Amazon fires fallout\n\nChile\u2019s president to sack entire cabinet in bid to end protests\n\nArgentina and Uruguay suffer \u2018massive\u2019 power outages to millions\n\nArgentina could close 10 government ministries to help stabilise peso", "description": "Argentina\u2019s centre-left Peronists are set to return to power after the incumbent president conceded defeat in an election dominated by concerns over rising poverty and a struggling economy.Voters opted for the Justicialist Party's Alberto Fernandez and rejected the austerity measures that Mauricio", "authors": ["Conrad Duncan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5GsRDrQ9RxMqDxA_gsOg9A--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/981baa7080dedc88299d53a190b60fd5", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
