It offers an insane 7680\u00d74320 8K resolution, which is four times the resolution of 4K and 16 times that of full HD. Needless to say, this is the sharpest, most detailed, and most color-accurate picture you can get from a Samsung TV.\n\nWhat's the difference between 8K and 4K? (Photo: Getty Images) More\n\nThe TV has a gargantuan 65-inch QLED display with the company\u2019s own \u201cQuantum Dot\u201d technology for exceptional color contrast. Trust us, you\u2019re not going to get a better viewing experience at home.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t have 8K movies and TV shows that are readily available to watch, this TV uses Samsung\u2019s 8K A.I. upscaling, which converts 4K videos into near-8K content. It\u2019s also great for gaming and watching live sports thanks to the \u201cMotion Rate 240\u201d (240Hz refresh rate) and \u201cReal Game Enhancer\u201d settings built-in for smooth and steady action with low lag time.\n\nThis 8K TV is also smart home compatible\u2014 Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Samsung\u2019s Bixby are all included. Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Now, Hulu, CBS All Access and even Apple AirPlay 2 and Apple TV are all ready to stream out-of-the-box.\n\nIn addition, the Samsung 65-inch Class 8K HDR10+ Smart QLED TV comes with four HDMI ports for Blu-ray players and video game consoles and three USB ports for thumb drives and external hard drives. It also supports Dolby Digital Plus for spectacular audio and surround sound.\n\nWith its 65-inch size, smart and streaming features built in, and outstanding 8K picture quality, this deal is great for anyone who wants to get a jump on future technology at a considerably low price point.\n\nThis 8K TV has a 4.8 out of five stars with hundreds of positive reviews.
