In the 13 years since its inception, the bit has evolved from an improvised one-liner to a series of elaborate segments, resulting in one of the most popular late night gags ever.\n\nIt all began during the third season of Jimmy Kimmel Live! when the host off-handedly ended a discouraging show by apologizing to Damon for bumping him from the episode. After the joke got a laugh from one of his producers, he started doing it every night.\n\n\u201cWe had a bad show\u2026The guests were bad, and I was feeling pretty bad about myself at the end of the program,\u201d Kimmel told NPR in 2013. \u201cAnd I decided to say, for the amusement of one of our producers who was standing next to me\u2026\u2019I want to apologize to Matt Damon. We ran out of time\u2019\u2026And he got a kick out of it, the producer, so I just started doing it every night to amuse him.\u201d\n\nKimmel went on to explain that there was no particular reason he chose the Bourne actor. \u201cMatt Damon was just the first name that popped into my head. I was trying to think of an A-list star, and somebody we absolutely would not bump if he was on the show\u2026The legs on this bit are unbelievable to me. I mean, people laugh every time I say it\u2026Repeating the same joke every single night, you\u2019d think eventually people would get tired of it, but they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAfter this went on for around a year, Damon was invited to appear on a 2006 Live! primetime special for a staged fight with Kimmel. \u201cI knew you were going to f\u2014king do it,\u201d Damon shouted as the credits rolled. \u201cOh, big funny, big f\u2014king laugh!\u201d\n\nIn 2007, Kimmel decided to pay Damon back for his onscreen blowup by enlisting his sidekick Guillermo to oust the actor from his own movie, The Bourne Ultimatum.\n\nThe bit really found its legs in 2008 when Kimmel\u2019s then-girlfriend, Sarah Silverman, and Damon teamed up to create the viral music video genius that was \u201cI\u2019m F\u2014king Matt Damon.\u201d Silverman appeared on Live! to present the song to Kimmel as a surprise, resulting in a clip that has been watched nearly 20 million times on YouTube.\n\nKimmel couldn\u2019t resist clapping back with a similar video in 2009, starring the special someone in Damon\u2019s life, Ben Affleck.\n\nDuring a 2010 Academy Awards night sketch in which Kimmel was voted out of The Handsome Men\u2019s Club by the likes of stars such as Matthew McConaughey, Rob Lowe and even Affleck, it was revealed that Damon was the mastermind behind his eviction.\n\nFinally, in 2013, Damon found a way to get the airtime he felt he deserved\u2014by hijacking Kimmel\u2019s hosting gig.\n\nAfter the takeover episode, Damon was invited to guest on the show with the cast of The Monuments Men. However, when Kimmel eventually got around to asking him a legitimate question, the fire alarm mysteriously went off before he could answer.\n\nThe duo eventually attempted to work through their differences in a session of couples counseling in 2015\u2014it was unsuccessful.\n\nSo Kimmel was all the more fired up when Affleck snuck Damon onto the Live! stage after the 2016 Oscars.\n\nDamon went undercover to reignite the feud in July, disguising himself in a mullet and sunglasses to infiltrate a segment in which Kimmel\u2019s Aunt Chippy was playing blackjack to win money for Live!\u2019s studio audience.\n\nFollowing that incident, the pair returned to couples therapy in a last-ditch attempt to salvage their relationship.\n\nBut when Kimmel took offense to comments Damon made about him to Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show, the rivalry raged on.\n\nDamon bounced back quickly, launching an attack ad against Kimmel\u2019s vice presidential campaign that the Live! host denounced during an August episode.\n\nHe then followed that up with a surprise appearance onstage at the Kimmel-hosted Emmys to taunt his nemesis about his loss to Last Week Tonight\u2019s John Oliver in the Outstanding Variety Talk Series category.\n\nAfter Kimmel expressed his hope for Damon to lose at the 2017 Oscars\u2014which the late night pundit hosted\u2014the actor retaliated once again by disguising himself as Tom Brady to sneak onto Live! following the New England Patriots\u2019 win at Super Bowl LI.\n\nDamon added fuel to the fire by hinting at a potential showdown on Oscar night. \u201cI\u2019ll only do something if he starts up something,\u201d he told Vanity Fair. If he starts any trouble, I\u2019ll have to fight back to defend myself!\u201d\n\nOf course, Kimmel didn\u2019t wait too long before he posted a photo of himself defacing the actor\u2019s seat card leading up to the awards show. \u201cBest Picture Vominee Matt Damon,\u201d he captioned the shot.\n\nThings got rolling early on Oscars night, with Kimmel aiming his first shot at Damon\u2019s recent choice in roles during his opening monologue. \u201cMatt could have starred in Manchester by the Sea\u2026He could have taken that lead actor part for himself, but he didn\u2019t. He gave that role to Casey Affleck, his childhood friend,\u201d Kimmel jokingly praised. \u201cHe handed what turned out to be an Oscar-caliber role over to his friend and made a Chinese ponytail movie instead. And that movie, The Great Wall, went on to lose $80 million.\u201d\n\nDamon responded to the affront by attempting to trip Kimmel as he walked through the audience.\n\nThen, as a lead-up to Damon presenting the award for Best Original Screenplay alongside Ben Affleck, Kimmel aired a pre-taped tribute in which he reminisced about the first time he saw the actor\u2019s 2011 flick We Bought a Zoo\u2014in a completely empty theater. \u201cThe thing about Matt is that you can see how hard he\u2019s working, it\u2019s so effortful for him,\u201d he mused.\n\nAnd the abuse didn\u2019t stop once Damon took the stage, with Kimmel having the announcer introduce him as \u201cGuest\u201d before directing the orchestra to play him off every time he tried to speak.\n\nThe night following the ceremony, Kimmel took to his own show to reveal he had intended to close the night with a final bit that involved him sitting in the audience next to Damon (a loser, according to Kimmel). However, his plan was derailed when he had to take the stage to help clear up that whole Best Picture mix-up.\n\nHe then made up for the missed Oscars opportunity by forcibly bumping Damon from a voiceover gig in a (fake) United Airlines commercial that spoofed the airline\u2019s overbooking crisis. \u201cIn some cases, some people deserve to get bumped,\u201d Kimmel joked.\n\nHowever, after Kimmel\u2019s newborn son \u2014 William \u201cBilly\u201d Kimmel \u2014 underwent open heart surgery at just three days old, the feud was put on pause for the first time since it began. \u201cEvery one of my friends was there 100%,\u201d Kimmel said while telling the emotional story on Live! \u201cWe had atheists praying for us, okay? We had people who do not believe in God praying for [our son]. And I hate to even say it, but even that son-of-a-b-tch Matt Damon sent flowers.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the peace didn\u2019t last for long. When Chris Hemsworth appeared on Live! to promote Thor: Ragnarok, he revealed that he had brought his co-star Mark Ruffalo and director Taika Waititi with him. But when Kimmel sent a camera backstage to chat with them, he found Damon lying in wait. \u201cIt\u2019s the mighty Thor not the mighty bore, so maybe take a walk,\u201d Kimmel told him.\n\nDamon then crashed George Clooney\u2019s interview on Live! for a mock debut of the actor\u2019s twins with wife Amal Clooney. \u201cI just want to make something very clear right now: they\u2019re cheering for the babies, not this person,\u201d Kimmel said as Damon walked onstage.\n\nDamon may have only shown up in a montage dedicated to movies about the military at the 90th Academy Awards, but Kimmel still had jokes: \u201cOn the behalf of the Academy, I want to apologize to our great U.S. military men and women here and overseas for including Matt Damon in that montage. You deserve better than that. You really do.\u201d\n\nKimmel then went after Damon for his portrayal of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on the 44th season premiere of Saturday Night Live. \u201cKavanaugh\u2019s testimony rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. In fact, he was so unlikeable that Saturday Night Live had no choice but to cast the most repugnant actor in the world to play him over the weekend,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cWhat a surprise that Matt Damon would have no other plans on a Saturday.\u201d\n\nOne week later, Kimmel celebrated Damon\u2019s 48th birthday by wishing him a happy 60th. \u201cThe big 6-0. I have to admit he looks pretty good for 60,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cThis year for his birthday, Matt wished for the same thing he wishes for every year: talent.\u201d\n\nAlthough it seemed like Kimmel and Damon managed to bury the hatchet while watching Game 5 of the 2018 World Series \u2014 the two were spotted together at Dodger Stadium in red and blue versions of the same \u201cI\u2019m with stupid\u201d t-shirt \u2014 Kimmel had a different take on the matter. \u201cLet me tell you something,\u201d he said on Live! the following night. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than paying a lot of money for tickets and having to sit next to an obnoxious jerk the whole game. And that is the last time I ever use Groupon again.\u201d\n\nBut while their fans got a kick out of the shirts, Ben Affleck \u2014 who joined Kimmel and Damon at the World Series \u2014 wasn\u2019t too fond of the stunt. During a February appearance on Live!, Affleck shared a widely-circulated photo of the trio sitting together in such a way that both Kimmel and Damon\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m with stupid\u201d arrows were pointed at him. \u201cTwo guys got to go with stupid to the World Series,\u201d he quipped. \u201cWhich I appreciate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, maybe next time don\u2019t bring him,\u201d Kimmel retorted in regard to Damon. \u201cHe ruins everything.\u201d\n\nThe most recent retaliation came from Kimmel, who enlisted Tom Brady to throw a football through the window of Matt Damon\u2019s house during a May appearance on Live! Since Damon just so happens to be a huge New England Patriots fan, this prank was particularly distressing for him. \u201cSorry about that,\u201d Kimmel told him. \u201cMy friend Tom threw that. We\u2019re just seeing how strong his arm is and turns out it\u2019s real strong. Went right through the window your house. That\u2019s how strong his arm is.\u201d\n\nWrite to Megan McCluskey at megan.mccluskey@time.com.", "description": "The infamous feud between Jimmy Kimmel and Matt Damon may technically be fake, but that doesn't make it any less entertaining.", "authors": ["Megan Mccluskey"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/matt-damon-jimmy-kimmel-feud.jpg?quality=85&w=594&h=396&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
