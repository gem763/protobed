And when you compare it to what we\u2019ve had to live through the last three years, it\u2019s a big difference, a big gap, leadership wise and courage wise.\u201d\n\nSpurs coach Gregg Popovich says he supports the comments from NBA commish Adam Silver surrounding the controversy with the league and China. pic.twitter.com/kKadrF6Xwp \u2014 Will Manso (@WillMansoWPLG) October 8, 2019\n\n\u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t easy for him to say,\u201d Popovich said of Silver\u2019s reaction to the China controversy. \u201cHe said that in an environment fraught with possible economic peril. But he sided with the principles that we all hold dearly, or most of us did until the last three years. So I\u2019m thrilled with what he said.\n\n\u201cAdam is a very progressive leader,\u201d Popovich added. \u201cWe all remember how he handled the situation with the former owner of the Clippers, which made everybody proud because it was the right thing to do. A couple years ago \u2014 I can\u2019t remember, time goes by quickly, two, three, four years ago \u2014 I was walking the streets of New York City during the Gay Pride parade, and I turned around and here comes a float and Adam\u2019s standing on the float with a big sign in support of LGBTQ and I felt great again, just like I did with the Clipper deal.\n\n\u201cAnd then we come out strongly for freedom of speech. I felt great again,\u201d Popovich concluded.\n\nBut the famously progressive coach completely avoided any discussion of the terrible human rights abuses the Chinese government perpetrates on a daily basis. Popovich completely ignored the mistreatment of gays, minorities, women, and Christians and Muslims that the autocratic, the communist Chinese government indulges every single day.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich launched into an attack on President Trump Tuesday, while defending NBA Commissioner Adam Silver's", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Jae-C.-Hong-1-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
