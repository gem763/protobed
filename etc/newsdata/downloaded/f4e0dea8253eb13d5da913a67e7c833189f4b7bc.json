Unfortunately when we lose weight the fatty tissue is also depleted from the face, leading one to look more drawn\".\n\nSimon Cowell has previously said that he would love to come and see Dr Nyla: \"He\u2019s not got the right people around him saying that\u2019s enough.\n\n\"I often refuse clients if they want to go overboard with cosmetic treatments \u2013 I just want clients to look and feel like the best version of themselves in the safest possible way.\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\n\"I am determined to provide only the best possible treatments, individual to each client, ensuring they have fantastic results.\u201d\n\nShe revealed how she would approach Simon's own needs adding that she thinks he should take a break from any more procedures.\n\n\"My biggest responsibility first and foremost is to my clients health and wellbeing. Simon\u2019s fallen face and \u2018sunken\u2019 eyes are a result of the wrong treatments being advised to him, leading to the facial muscles starting to drop around the eye area.\"\n\n(Image: GC Images)\n\n(Image: NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)\n\n\"I believe Simon should step away from cosmetic treatments for a while and try focusing on non-surgical treatments to lift and tighten the sagging skin.\n\n\"I am a huge advocate of using a combination of non-invasive treatments such as ultrasound technology to lift the skin at its deepest level and radio frequency to tighten the skin.\n\n\"To revitalise the entire face I recommend an Intraceuticals Oxygen Facial as it is an effective, non-invasive way to enhance and restore the quality of your skin which may be affected by your lifestyle or as you age \u2013 or in Simon\u2019s case \u2013 too many procedures!\n\n\"Intraceutical facials use hyperbaric oxygen to enhance the delivery of serums used in treatments. Oxygen is a natural bacteria which helps keep the skin cool and calm during treatment.\"\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nEarlier this year, Simon spoke candidly about making changes to his lifestyle after he was hospitalised in October 2017 after he fainted due to low blood pressure .\n\nSpeaking to Extra TV in June, he said: \"I went to see this guy who's very well-known. And he said to me, after doing some blood work, 'You can't have red meat, dairy, sugar, bread or gluten'.\"\n\nSimon, who shares son Eric, five, with partner Lauren Silverman, 42, said the first thing he asked about was whether or not he could drink alcohol.\n\nHe said: \"And he said, 'Maybe not quite as much as you had before'. And I did it and I stuck to it and it's easy.\"\n\nThe star joked he was on the same diet as his little boy, saying: \"Apart from ice-cream, he actually likes water, eats all his raw vegetable. I'm on the Eric Cowell diet.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
