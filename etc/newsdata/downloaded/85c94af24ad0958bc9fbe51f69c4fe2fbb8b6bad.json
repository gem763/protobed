Zucca hit her head and had to get eight stitches. Waste management employee Billy Shelby saw it happen and stayed with Zucca in her driveway until the ambulance arrived.\n\n\u201cI was alarmed because she\u2019s an elderly woman and I knew she was in bad shape,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cI could see the fear in her eyes. I called an ambulance and I took off my jacket and put it on her because it was cold.\u201d\n\nCourtesy Colette Kingston\n\nAfter the incident, Shelby wanted to make sure it would never happen again. Now, every Tuesday when he visits Zucca\u2019s home, he makes it a point to wheel Zucca\u2019s trashcan back up the driveway for her each time after he empties it.\n\nZucca\u2019s family knew that a waste management employee helped her bring her trashcan up after her fall, but her doorbell camera revealed that Shelby\u2019s kindness went much further than just a driveway drop off.\n\nThe footage showed Shelby walking up the driveway slowly arm-in-arm with Zucca while holding her trashcan. After the can was placed and Shelby went to leave, he gave Zucca a big hug.\n\n\u201cGood to see you,\u201d Shelby told Zucca. \u201cAnd God bless you as always, darling.\u201d\n\nShelby took the time to speak with Zucca further even complimenting her hair. \u201cYou\u2019re looking good. I like that hair! You\u2019ve got it down,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to work on mine.\u201d\n\nShelby then gave Zucca an enthusiastic goodbye as he hopped on the truck and drove off.\n\nCourtesy Colette Kingston\n\nWhen Zucca\u2019s daughter Colette Kingston discovered the footage, she said it brought tears to her eyes.\n\n\u201cI actually got teary-eyed that a stranger would take a couple minutes out of their day to not only help her, but to build a relationship and a friendship,\u201d Kingston said.\n\nFor Zucca\u2019s family it was unbelievably touching, but for Shelby it was just the right thing to do.\n\n\u201cI always try to make her smile. That\u2019s my goal,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cI always tell myself how do you know you\u2019re a good person: Is it when you you\u2019re doing good things when people are watching or when people are not watching? I did it because it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nKingston posted the video to Facebook and had millions of views. For Shelby, the reaction the video has gotten is very humbling.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not on Facebook so I didn\u2019t understand the noise behind it,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cEverybody has a grandmother, so I can see why people are impacted by it.\u201d\n\nShelby hopes the video will help spread kindness.\n\n\u201cIf you do the right thing when no one is looking, it\u2019s really good for the soul,\u201d Shelby said.", "description": "A sweet moment between an elderly woman with dementia and a waste management employee caught on a doorbell camera is restoring our faith in humanity.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/opal-1-ht-er-191021_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
