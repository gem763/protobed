He was scheduled for arraignment on Wednesday.\n\nMessages to his attorney, Seymour Amster, were not immediately returned.\n\nEd Buck is transported for booking following his arrest on charges of running a drug house and giving meth to a man who overdosed last week, the 3rd man known to overdose in his WeHo apartment after 2 others died https://t.co/mDq8eefD7E pic.twitter.com/T2tM658Bxw \u2014 KTLA (@KTLA) September 18, 2019\n\nBuck, 65, has donated tens of thousands of dollars to California candidates, including Gov. Gavin Newsom, and is well known in LGBTQ political circles.\n\nBuck came under investigation in January after 55-year-old Timothy Dean was found dead of an accidental methamphetamine overdose in his apartment. It was the second such death in two years, following the July 2017 death of Gemmel Moore, 26.\n\nBoth men were black. Buck, who is white, was not charged and critics later questioned if wealth, race or political ties influenced the investigation.\n\nThe investigation into those deaths continues, county district attorney\u2019s spokesman Greg Risling said.\n\nBuck\u2019s attorney had said Dean came to Buck\u2019s home under the influence and didn\u2019t ingest any drugs while there.\n\nIn their bail motion, however, prosecutors specifically blamed Buck\u2019s actions for the two deaths and they alleged he personally gave a dangerous dose of methamphetamine to a man who survived an overdose earlier this month.\n\nOn Sept. 11, the man returned and Buck injected him with two more dangerous doses, refused to help him and \u201cthwarted\u201d his efforts to get help until the man fled the apartment and called 911 from a gas station, prosecutors alleged.\n\n\u201cHis deadly behavior has not stopped,\u201d prosecutors contended.\n\nBuck\u2019s \u201cpredatory acts and willful disregard for human life must be stopped before another life is lost,\u201d their motion read.", "description": "Two men have been found dead in Buck's home due to overdoses since 2017.
