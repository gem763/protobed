The utility operates all 58 French nuclear reactors, which account for around 75 percent of the country\u2019s electricity needs.\n\nThe other 20 reactors are offline for planned statutory maintenance, refuelling or upgrades. [POWER/FR]\n\nOutput at EDF\u2019s 1,330-megawatt (MW) Paluel 3 nuclear reactor was down by around 65 percent due to the strike.\n\nPower generation was reduced by around 60 percent at the 900 MW Gravelines 2 nuclear rector, while at the 1,310 MW Nogent 2 reactor, output was reduced to 800 MW. The Blayais 1, St. Laurent 1, Chinon 1 and Cruas 2 nuclear reactors were also hit by the strike.\n\nElectricity production was also curbed at the Blenod 5, and the Martigues Ponteau 5 and 6 gas-fired power plants, EDF data showed.", "description": "A nationwide strike by workers of French utility EDF in protest against a plan to restructure the state-controlled company reduced power generation at several nuclear and gas fired power plants on Wednesday evening, company data showed.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
