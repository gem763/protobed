The giant-peach cover caught many eyes: \u201cSuch an epic cover,\u201d ameliadimz wrote on Instagram. \u201cFinally, indeed!\u201d added alisha39. \u201cThing is, it won\u2019t happen,\u201d prisonescapee cautioned. Ad Age\u2019s Ann-Christine Diaz wrote, \u201cA symbol that many of us associate with a childhood literary treasure now takes a gruesome turn.\u201d Of Chait\u2019s proposed articles of impeachment, Jack D. Weiss wrote, \u201cThis article should be sent to Nancy Pelosi and all members of the Senate and House. All they have to do is read, copy and paste.\u201d Many readers responded to Nuzzi\u2019s dispatch on how Republicans are viewing the proceedings with some level of exhaustion: \u201cThis is utterly depressing,\u201d tweeted @janzentina. \u201cThis is Trump\u2019s genius: civic paralysis via anesthesia,\u201d added the New York Times\u2019 Jesse Wegman. Others commented on developments after the magazine was published: Andrew Hoffer wrote, \u201c[Trump] has managed to outdo himself since by committing an even worse offense \u2014 crimes against humanity. By abandoning the Kurds and our own military in the field, not to mention destroying a state of balance that has for five years countered the chaos endemic to the region, he shouldn\u2019t just be facing a trial in the Senate. He should be sitting in the Hague.\u201d\n\n2 In \u201cOne Night at Mount Sinai\u201d (October 14\u201327), Lisa Miller told the story of Aja Newman, who was sexually assaulted at the hospital by a \u201crock star\u201d emergency-room physician. Jodi Kantor, the New York Times reporter who helped expose Harvey Weinstein\u2019s predation, wrote, \u201cThis story \u2026 goes in my personal canon of the very best #metoo writing. Stay until the end.\u201d Vice\u2019s Anna Merlan tweeted, \u201cI wrote about this when the victims first came forward and was treated to a barrage of defensive emails from the doctor\u2019s friends about how he would never, how dare I, how dare these women, etc.\u201d Esther Choo, an emergency-medicine physician and professor, wrote: \u201cThere is a narrative out there about the fallen superstar. Lisa Miller resisted it. Centering this story on Aja means we cannot avoid the \u2018grotesque\u2019 horribleness of what happened and the many ways we ensure she is powerless within the walls of healthcare.\u201d In an open letter to Aja Newman, TIME\u2019S UP Healthcare wrote, \u201cYour story has already galvanized critical conversations within our community. All of health care must confront, head-on, the factors that allowed you to be assaulted and permitted disbelief thereafter \u2026 We cannot thank you enough for your unflinching courage. We have to do better, and we promise to try.\u201d Marissa Hoechstetter, who has spoken out about being sexually assaulted by her OB/GYN and worked with New York assemblywoman Aravella Simotas to introduce bills to protect patients, commented, \u201cMedicine is ripe for abuse, and a study on sexual misconduct by doctors estimated that fewer than 1 in 10 victims report. We cannot expect what is essentially a self-regulating industry to improve on its own. What is their incentive if we keep writing off stories like mine or Aja\u2019s as aberrations?\u201d\n\n3 Bliss Broyard documented the lives of several people in Stockton, California, the first U.S. city to test run universal basic income (\u201cWhat Would You Do With an Extra $500 a Month?,\u201d October 14\u201327). The author Dani Shapiro wrote, \u201cThe talk about UBI during the debates got me curious how it actually impacts people\u2019s lives, so it was interesting to read these five case studies of people who are getting $500 a month in Stockton.\u201d The writer and filmmaker Victoria Bouloubasis called the stories a \u201cthorough and very human look into what happens when universal basic income is put into practice.\u201d Stockton mayor Michael D. Tubbs wrote to us, \u201cBefore his death, Dr. King advocated for a guaranteed income. His dream is now becoming a reality in my hometown of Stockton. So far, we\u2019ve found that recipients are spending the $500 just like you and I would: on food, utilities, and rent. I hope you see like I do that the best investments government can make are in our people.\u201d Matt Zwolinski, the director of the Center for Ethics, Economics, and Public Policy at the University of San Diego, is unconvinced by the study: \u201cI am a vocal supporter of a basic income guarantee. But I am skeptical that we can learn much of value about how a large-scale basic income would work from the Stockton experiment. A large body of data already supports the conclusion that recipients of cash transfers generally do not spend the money on \u2018vice\u2019 goods, but because 40% of the money in Stockton is received in cash, we have nothing more reliable than self-reports to determine how recipients spend it. Moreover, because the experiment is only 18 months long, it does not tell us much about how recipients might change their behavior in response to permanent transfers, for instance by greatly reducing their participation in the labor market. The Stockton experiment is good storytelling, but poor social science.\u201d\n\nSend correspondence to comments@nymag.com.
