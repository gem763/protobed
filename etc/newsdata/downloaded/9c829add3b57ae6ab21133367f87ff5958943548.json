The Democrats wanna take away your guns. They wanna take away your health care. They wanna take away your vote. They wanna take away your freedom. They wanna take away your judges. They want to take away everything,\" Trump said. \"We can never let this happen. We are fighting to drain the swamp and that's exactly what I'm doing and you see why we have to do it, because our country is at stake like never before.\"\n\n\"It's all very simple. They're trying to stop me because I am fighting for you and I'll never let that happen,\" he concluded.\n\nTrump is right. The Democrats made up their mind about him before he even won the 2016 election. They have repeatedly tried to derail the progress he has made because it shows what a failure the Democratic Party truly is. President Trump has done more for our judiciary than, arguably, any other president. Employment is at a record high, especially for hispanics and blacks. He has rolled back regulations and allowed small businesses to thrive. People are starting to feel more confident that things are turning around, that their lives are going to improve.\n\nAnd what have Democrats done? They have tried time and time again to stop him. First, it was going after then Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh. They continually pushed this notion that he sexually assaulted multiple women. When then learned Christine Blasey Ford was motivated by Roe v. Wade and didn't like Kavanaugh's pro-life stance. They tried again recently with the New York Times' \"smoking gun\" that he assaulted Deborah Ramirez. Again, that was torn to shreds when we learned the person making the allegations was a Democratic rival who worked against Kavanaugh during the Clinton scandal in the 90s.\n\nFor two-and-a-half years we heard about about another \"smoking gun\" that took place with Russia collusion. We find out from the Democrats' own chosen one, Special Counsel Robert Mueller, that no obstruction and no collusion took place. Again, they couldn't tear Trump down so what do they do? Now they're focusing on Ukraine and Trump's alleged wrong-doing, instead of the corruption surrounding the Bidens.\n\nAnd Democrats wonder why Americans elected Trump?
