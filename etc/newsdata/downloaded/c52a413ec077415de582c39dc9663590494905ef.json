For novice and experienced fantasy players alike, familiarizing yourself with your league\u2019s settings is a crucial step in that process.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIn the world of fantasy basketball, almost all leagues operate under either a Points or Categorical format. These formats share some overlap, but whereas in categorial leagues the goal is to win \u2014 or finish highly within \u2014 as many stat categories as possible, Points leagues present a different challenge.\n\n[Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Basketball league for free today]\n\nUnlike category leagues, Points leagues disregard altogether how players go about accruing fantasy stats. Like with most fantasy football leagues, each statistical category is assigned a point value, and each player\u2019s points \u2014 regardless of how they\u2019re earned \u2014 are simply added up to produce a final score over a given period, which is typically one week.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s official fantasy points scoring format uses the following values:\n\nPoints: 1 point\n\nRebounds: 1.2 points\n\nAssists: 1.5 points\n\nSteals: 3 points\n\nBlocks: 3 points\n\nTurnovers: -1 point\n\nTailoring your league to your preference\n\nThose may be the default numbers, but most host sites will allow you to tailor the values to your league\u2019s specific preferences. For instance, if you\u2019d like to increase the impact of blocked shots, you could raise that point value accordingly. In the same vein, you can add or subtract categories, which will have ripple effects in terms of which player archetypes lose or gain value.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you were to add, say, Made Three-Pointers as another category alongside Points, stars like Stephen Curry and James Harden would become even more sought-after, while lesser-known three-point specialists like Joe Harris or J.J. Redick would also pick up some value.\n\nIn categorical leagues, it\u2019s difficult to manage each category \u2014 usually, there are eight or nine \u2014 and ensure your roster doesn\u2019t have any major deficiencies. A well-rounded team is a near-requirement for title contention, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case in points leagues. One of the benefits to points formats is not having to worry about being dragged down in a single category.\n\nStephen Curry's value varies drastically depending on the format. Mandatory Credit:Sergio Estrada-USA TODAY Sports\n\nUnderstanding which players fit which format\n\nIf a player is an elite rebounder or shot-blocker but struggles at the free throw line, that deficiency is masked in a way that it would not be in a category league. As such, players like Andre Drummond, Hassan Whiteside, Russell Westbrook, and Ben Simmons typically become more valuable in points formats, as their elite counting stats translate directly to \u201cfantasy points,\u201d as opposed to only affecting certain categories.\n\nConsider the following example: Let\u2019s say on a given night, Andre Drummond scores 0 points, going 0-for-10 from the field and 0-for-10 at the free throw line. However, he grabs 20 rebounds and blocks five shots.\n\nIf you were in a categorial league, the rebounds and blocks would be nice, but Drummond\u2019s lack of scoring would add nothing to your Points category, and his poor shooting would negatively impact both your Field Goal Percentage and Free Throw Percentage categories.\n\nConversely, in a points league, you\u2019d only be concerned about Drummond\u2019s total fantasy output. Sure, it\u2019d be nice if he scored some points to add to his bottom line, but the 20 rebounds and five blocks alone would be worth 39 fantasy points under the aforementioned standard scoring system. Unless your league assigns negative value for field goal/free throw attempts, the fact that Drummond had a horrific night shooting the ball would not affect your team in the same way it would in a categorical league.\n\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s important to consider the type of players who gain or lose value in points formats. Counting-stat monsters like the four mentioned above tend to rise in rankings, while players valued for their efficiency \u2014 think Malcolm Brogdon or Stephen Curry \u2014 lose some value.\n\nMeanwhile, points leagues depreciate the value of players who produce above-average numbers in only one or two categories. Unless those categories are heavily weighted \u2014 for example, if your league awards 4 points for each steal \u2014 a bench player who averages 1.5 steals per game but offers little else isn\u2019t nearly as valuable as he\u2019d be to a gamer in a categorical league who\u2019s looking to make a climb up the Steals category.\n\nSimilarly, single-category specialists, and especially score-first players, tend to have diminished value in points formats. Someone like Terrence Ross would aid a categorical owner in Points and Threes, but his relative lack of rebounds, assists, and defensive numbers mean he\u2019s really only helping points-league gamers build value through one source, and scoring is far and away the easiest stat to find and therefore, it tends to carry the lowest point value.\n\nPlayer A: 20pts, 5reb, 2ast, 1stl, 0blk = 32 fantasy points\n\nPlayer B: 8pts, 10reb, 5ast, 2stl, 1blk = 36.5 fantasy points\n\nPreparing for your draft\n\nWhen it comes to preparing for a points league draft, the bottom line is you\u2019re looking for the best overall fantasy players. Using projections you trust is especially valuable in points leagues, as you can simply plug in your league\u2019s scoring values to generate a list of players ranked by their expected total fantasy output. In a sense, that should make building a roster easier, as long as you make sure to account for filling each required position.\n\nSpeaking of which, be sure to familiarize yourself with your league\u2019s roster settings, in addition to its scoring values. Most leagues won\u2019t require you to jump through hoops, but it\u2019s important to know ahead of time if you should be targeting certain positions.\n\nA league that requires two starting centers, for example, makes the position more valuable and raises the importance of locking down productive options at both starting spots. In short, you don\u2019t want to be the gamer who waits too long and is forced to start Dwight Powell and Serge Ibaka each week while more productive options at other positions waste away on your bench. Regardless of format, roster balance is key.\n\nAmong the other factors to consider in points leagues \u2014 or any league, for that matter \u2014 is the weekly schedule breakdown. Every team plays 82 games, but not all weeks are created equally, and there will certainly be times when it makes sense to bench an elite player for an inferior option.\n\nIf the Wizards play only two games in a given week, while the Rockets play five, benching Bradley Beal for Eric Gordon is the logical play, even though Beal is the vastly superior player. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the calculation using last season\u2019s averages (rounded to the nearest whole number) and standard points league values:\n\nBeal: 26 PPG, 6 APG, 5 RPG, 2 SPG, 1 BPG = 50 FP/G; 50 FP x 2 games = 100 FP\n\nGordon: 16 PPG, 2 APG, 2 RPG, 1 SPG, 0 BPG = 24.4 FP/G; 24.4 FG x 5 games = 122 FP\n\nMore From Yahoo Fantasy Sports", "description": "Nick Whalen provides some key strategies for being successful in a fantasy basketball points league.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/25s2KAi4avAAxgOJz3QHfA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iCGoNc_pGDj_CZhR2EyTwQ--~B/aD0yODM4O3c9NDI1NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/b1f00190-dfe2-11e9-9bdf-eee8fc0a7425", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
