It did not disclose the size of the fine, which is to be donated to charity.\n\n\u201cEngland have been fined for a breach of World Cup tournament rules relating to cultural challenges, which states that no players from the team receiving the challenge may advance beyond the halfway line,\u201d the sport\u2019s governing body said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis is in line with the protocol which operates globally across the international game.\u201d\n\nIn the 2011 tournament France were fined 2,500 pounds ($3,216.75) when they also advanced on the haka before the final.\n\nAsked about England\u2019s actions after the match, captain Owen Farrell said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t just want to stand in a flat line and let them come at us.\u201d\n\nWorld Rugby\u2019s Youtube video of the incident, titled \u201cEngland\u2019s incredible response to intense New Zealand haka\u201d with a commentator saying \u201cyou want box office? You\u2019ve got it\u201d, has been viewed more than four million times.\n\nNew Zealand coach Hansen said on Wednesday he had no problems with England\u2019s response.\n\n\u201cIf you understand the haka, then the haka requires a response,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a challenge to you personally and it requires you to have a response.\n\n\u201cI thought it was brilliant and quite imaginative too.\u201d\n\nFellow New Zealander Warren Gatland took a similar view, with the Wales coach calling it a \u201cperfect response\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor them to do something like that is completely respectful as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t turn their backs or anything like that. They stood there and received the haka.\n\n\u201cIreland in Chicago a few years ago did a number eight in respect for Anthony Foley and other teams have done it in their own way.\n\n\u201cI was involved with the All Blacks against Ireland and Willie Anderson linked arms with everyone else and they marched forwards.\n\n\u201cAfter the match they were severely criticised by the press for how disrespectful that was. As All Blacks, no one mentioned a thing afterwards.\u201d\n\nThe haka, he added, was a challenge to an opponent\u2019s toughness and physicality.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important you don\u2019t take a backward step and you respond respectfully. England did that.\u201d\n\n($1 = 0.7772 pounds)", "description": "England have been fined for their response to the haka before Saturday's World Cup semi-final victory over New Zealand, despite All Blacks coach Steve Hansen describing their V-shaped formation as \"brilliant\" and \"imaginative\".", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446460623&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0IJ-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
