I think people -- I know nothing about it, in terms of the report. ... I\u2019m waiting for the report like everybody else. But I predict you will see things that you don\u2019t even believe, the level of corruption -- whether it\u2019s [James] Comey; whether it\u2019s [Peter] Strzok and his lover, [Lisa] Page; whether it\u2019s so many other people -- [Andrew] McCabe; whether it\u2019s President Obama himself. Let\u2019s see whether or not it\u2019s President Obama. Let\u2019s see whether or not they put that in.\"\n\nOn Monday, former Utah GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz, now a Fox News contributor, told \"Hannity\" that bureaucratic squabbling was the reason the report isn't already available.\n\n\u201cEvidently, there\u2019s an intra-agency debate and really a food fight if you will about the classification issues,\u201d Chaffetz said. \u201cRemember in the last report put out by Horowitz, there were only seven words or so that were redacted. The Democrats threw a fit that they couldn\u2019t see the whole thing. This could have 10 to 20 percent of the report redacted.\u201d\n\nChaffetz speculated that Obama administration Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and ex-CIA Director John Brennan could be behind the apparent delay.\n\nCARTER PAGE WONDERS: WHY ISN'T HOROWITZ EVEN INTERVIEWING ME?\n\nThat was a reference to Horowitz's bombshell initial report last year, which identified misconduct by senior FBI officials, including Strzok and Page, who exchanged anti-Trump text messages while investigating his campaign.\n\nLast month Horowitz told lawmakers his team had nearly completed his review and submitted a draft to Attorney General William Barr.\n\n\u201cWe have now begun the process of finalizing our report by providing a draft of our factual findings to the department and the FBI for classification determination and marking,\u201d Horowitz wrote last month to several House and Senate committees. \u201cThis step is consistent with our process for reports such as this one that involve classified material.\u201d\n\nThe declassification process is one of the final steps before public release.\n\nHorowitz and his investigators have probed how the infamous and salacious anti-Trump dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele was used to secure the original Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant for former Trump aide Carter Page in October 2016, as well as three renewals.\n\nHorowitz\u2019s team has looked into why the FBI may have regarded Steele -- funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC) -- a credible source, and why the bureau used news reports to bolster Steele\u2019s credibility before the FISA court.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHorowitz's probe is not the only ongoing review at the DOJ. U.S. Attorney John Durham's probe into possible misconduct by the intelligence community at the outset of the Russia investigation has expanded in scope recently, based on Durham's initial findings, Fox News reported earlier this month.\n\nDurham, known as a \"hard-charging, bulldog\" prosecutor, according to a source, has been focusing on the period before Nov. 7, 2016 \u2014 including the use and assignments of FBI informants, as well as alleged improper issuance of FISA warrants. Durham was asked to help Barr \"ensure that intelligence collection activities by the U.S. government related to the Trump 2016 presidential campaign were lawful and appropriate.\"", "description": "The long-awaited report from the Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz on potential surveillance abuses by intelligence officials during the 2016 Russia investigation is still in the declassification process, a DOJ official told Fox News on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Gregg Re", "Gregg Re Is A Lawyer", "Editor Based In Los Angeles.
