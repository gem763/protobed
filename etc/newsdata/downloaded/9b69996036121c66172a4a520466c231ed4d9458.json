As a result, Martin decided he\u2019d had enough of Ben\u2019s demands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe spilled the beans to Jack (Scott Maslen), and a plan was subsequently set in motion. As a result, Tubbs was arrested, and Martin proceeded to pull out all the stops to ensure Ben accompanied him on the pick-up so that the police could catch him in the act.\n\nThe plan was successful, and Ben was arrested on the job \u2014 while Martin got out of dodge.\n\nLater, a fuming Ben asked Martin to meet him at home, and proceeded to threaten the fruit-and-veg stall owner over his actions. However, Martin remained unfazed by Ben\u2019s words, and called him nothing more than a coward.\n\nMartin may have the upper hand right now, but it\u2019s clear that Ben\u2019s not going to let him away with what happened.\n\nThere\u2019ll no doubt be huge repercussions \u2014 but what price will Martin pay for betraying Ben?\n\nEastEnders continues Friday 25thOctober at 8:30pm.\n\nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: A dark new storyline is revealed for Ben Mitchell as he takes revenge\n\nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: Martin Fowler in serious danger \u2014 but will he die?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Martin has been at Ben's beck and call for the last few weeks, but he took drastic action to put an end to the pair's alliance tonight.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ben-Mitchell-in-EastEnders-3e32_1571922938.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
