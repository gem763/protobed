Jevans emphasized that 95% of what CipherTrace identifies as criminal activity is really using more popular cryptos like Bitcoin and Ether.\n\nUnintended consequences\n\nOnce imposed, global crypto regulations like the FATF travel rule, which requires exchanges to collect personal data of users, will have unintended consequences like pushing criminal activity to privacy coins such as Monero (XMR) and Dash (DASH), Jevans warned.\n\nAccording to the CipherTrace executive, regulators\u2019 deanonymization efforts will only make the exchange of pseudonymous coins like BTC more like banking. Jevans said:\n\n\u201cAs we get more of this deanonymization and it becomes more like banking, I think an unintended consequence will be there will be concerted effort to use these privacy-enhanced coins.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 15, CipherTrace announced it expanded its crypto intelligence platform to track 700 tokens, noting that it can now trace \u201cmore than 87% of the transactional volume\u201d of the top 100 cryptos such as Ether, Tether (USDT), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC). However, the firm told Cointelegraph that privacy coins such as Monero will not be supported on the platform in the near future.\n\nIn mid-September, OKEx Korea, the South Korean arm of the major global crypto exchange OKEx, officially announced it will delist privacy coins including Monero, Dash, Zcash (ZEC), Horizen (ZEN) and Super Bitcoin (SBTC).", "description": "95% of criminal activity in crypto accounts for Bitcoin and Ether due to their brand name and ease of use, CipherTrace\u2019s CEO says", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9hZTRlNGE3MmIzN2U0MTFkMzc3YWUxZGE2Mzk2YjhlZS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
