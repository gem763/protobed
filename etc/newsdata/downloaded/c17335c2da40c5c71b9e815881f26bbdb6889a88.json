The reversal came just weeks after California approved a law allowing college athletes within the state to earn income from endorsement deals despite resistance from the NCAA and the Pac 12 conference.\n\n\u201cWe must embrace change to provide the best possible experience for college athletes,\u201d said Michael Drake, chairman of the NCAA Board of Governors and president of The Ohio State University. \u201cAdditional flexibility in this area can and must continue to support college sports as a part of higher education.\u201d\n\nNFL PLAYERS, COLLEGE ATHLETES GROUP PARTNER TO EXPLORE PAY OPPORTUNITIES\n\n\u201cThis modernization for the future is a natural extension of the numerous steps NCAA members have taken in recent years to improve support for student-athletes, including full cost of attendance and guaranteed scholarships,\u201d Drake added.\n\nThe NCAA did not provide specific details about how it would govern efforts by athletes to profit from their names, images and likenesses. However, the board said in a release that \u201cmodernization should occur within the following principles and guidelines.\u201d\n\nThe organization said student-athletes should not receive special treatment relative to non-student athletes and should maintain their focus on education as a priority. The NCAA will ensure that rules related to student-athlete compensation are \u201ctransparent, focused and enforceable.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe NCAA appears to remain opposed to the notion of student-athletes receiving any form of salary or direct pay tied on-field performance, noting that \u201ccompensation for athletics performance or participation is impermissible.\u201d Guidelines will also prevent schools from offering compensation-related perks to lure top athletes during the recruiting process.\n\n\u201cAs a national governing body, the NCAA is uniquely positioned to modify its rules to ensure fairness and a level playing field for student-athletes,\u201d NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a statement. \u201cThe board\u2019s action today creates a path to enhance opportunities for student-athletes while ensuring they compete against students and not professionals.\u201d\n\nThe NCAA and its conference have long argued that student-athlete compensation went against the principle of amateurism and would unbalance the recruiting process.\n\nSigned into law by California Gov. Gavin Newsom earlier this month, the \u201cFair Pay to Play\u201d act allowed college athletes to sign endorsement deals and hire agents to pursue endorsement-related income without fear of penalty. Similar bills were set to be proposed in New York, Colorado and South Carolina, among other states.\n\nMounting political scrutiny also extended to Capitol Hill. Republican Sen. Mitt Romney warned earlier this month that Congress was \"coming for\" the NCAA and would seek action on student-athlete compensation.\n\n\u201cThe NCAA Board of Governors finally recognized that change is coming, and they need to adapt their rules to catch up with the times. We believe those rules must be changed to allow athletes to be compensated. The name, image and likeness approach has its own challenges that we must address, and we\u2019ll be carefully reviewing the NCAA\u2019s next steps and working on ways Congress can reform college sports,\u201d Romney said in a joint statement with Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut. \u201cWe need to correct the inequities between what college coaches and the institutions make versus what the athletes receive and protect college athletes\u2019 health and educational opportunities.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nSouth Carolina State Rep. Justin Bamberg, who plans to co-sponsor a similar bill in January, said his proposal was \u201creally just about fairness.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got players who are losing eligibility, they\u2019re getting kicked off the teams and stuff for accepting $50 in gas money from people,\u201d lawmaker Bamberg told FOX Business earlier this month. \u201cThat\u2019s just utterly ridiculous when it\u2019s a multibillion-dollar industry and everybody else is cashing out on it.\"\n\nThis story has been updated.", "description": "The NCAA\u2019s board of governors told its three athletics divisions to update their bylaws to address its stance on the matter.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
