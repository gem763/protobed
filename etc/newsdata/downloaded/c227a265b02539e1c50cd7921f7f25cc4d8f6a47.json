A medical examiner determined he was fed a needle full of insulin right into his stomach, despite the fact that he had no history of diabetes, despite the fact that hospital records show no order for the shot.\n\n\u201cI thought my dad was safe here,\u201d his daughter, Melanie Proctor, told USA Today.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Joe Manchin, West Virginia Democrat, confirmed that authorities are indeed investigating a \u201cperson of interest.\u201d And the FBI is involved; Attorney General William P. Barr has also said the Department of Justice will provide whatever investigative resources are needed to solve the case reviews.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: What is taking so dang long?\n\nThe Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center in Clarksburg sure does seem the place to be if you\u2019re a veteran with a death wish. But it\u2019s not like that reputation sprung overnight.\n\n\u201cManchin,\u201d the Military Times wrote, \u201csaid the VA inspector general told his office about the opening of a medical and criminal investigation of the hospital in July 2018, after at least nine patients were diagnosed with unexplained low blood sugar. He said he told Barr in a letter that he has \u2018grave concerns over the pace of the investigations.\u2019 \u201c\n\nSo should all of America. Nine patients? Seems questions could\u2019ve come at number two. Number three at most.\n\nThese are our veterans \u2014 our honored, esteemed, self-sacrificing U.S. veterans, after all. And, in the eyes of the left, at least, weren\u2019t they being taken care of by the best \u2014 by the government health care best? Go Obamacare.\n\nHospital administrators say all due care is now being taken to make sure \u2014 well, to put it bluntly, to make sure nobody else is murdered at the facility.\n\nManchin is assuring that the \u201cperson of interest\u201d is no longer \u201cin contact with veterans at the VA facility\u201d and that he, personally, as a member of the Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee, is going to \u201cdo everything in my power to investigate\u201d and \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of these suspicious deaths.\n\nWell and good.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t solve the real puzzler, though.\n\nMcDermott\u2019s daughter Proctor launched a wrongful death suit against the VA via Tony O\u2019Dell of the Tiano O\u2019Dell law office in Charleston. And as O\u2019Dell said to USA Today: McDermott\u2019s was not the first to die. Rather, among the last.\n\n\u201cIt should never have gotten to Mr. McDermott,\u201d he said.\n\nExactly.\n\nThat it did, and that the investigation is still in the investigation phase, rather than prosecution and retribution stages, is a shameful sluggish seeming shoulder-shrug of justice \u2014 and of our nation\u2019s finest fighting forces.\n\nOur veterans deserve better.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
