Global ad spending rose 6.7% in 2018.\n\nWith major European economies teetering on a recession, owing to trade tensions and the uncertainty around Brexit, businesses have tightened their purse strings, in turn hurting advertising budgets.\n\nZenith, owned by French advertising group Publicis (PUBP.PA), forecast that global ad spending will reach $640 billion this year, with a 4.3% rise in 2020 and 4.4% in 2021, down from previous forecasts of 4.4% growth in 2020 and 4.3% in 2021.\n\nThe forecaster said it would normally expect an increase in ad spending in 2020, benefiting from U.S. elections, the Summer Olympics and the UEFA Euro 2020 tournament.\n\n\u201cBut given current political and economic uncertainty, brands are being cautious about committing to extra spending at the moment,\u201d it added.\n\nZenith forecast a 0.6% decline for ad spending in Germany this year, down from a prior expectation of fall of 0.4%. It also reduced its growth forecast for the UK to 3.3% from 3.9%, its slowest rate of growth since 2011.\n\nGerman industrial orders fell more than expected in August on weaker domestic demand, data showed on Monday, adding to signs that a manufacturing slump is pushing Europe\u2019s largest economy into recession.\n\nExpenditure on advertising in China, the world\u2019s second biggest spender after the United States, is also slowing.\n\nHowever, small and medium-sized companies advertising for the first time on Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) are continuing to drive growth in the United States, where consumer spending chugs along at a steady pace.\n\n\u201cSmall businesses in the U.S. are spending heavily on social media and paid search, and are fuelling much of the global growth of these channels,\u201d Zenith researchers said.\n\nThe firm said ad spending on social media is expected to grow 20% in 2019, overtaking print to become the third-largest advertising channel.", "description": "Global advertising spending in 2019 is expected to grow lower than a previous estimate, hurt by recession fears in the United Kingdom and Germany, despite strong growth in digital ad budgets in the United States.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
