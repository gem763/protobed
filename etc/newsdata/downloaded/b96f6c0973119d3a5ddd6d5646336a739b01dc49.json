They charged in with signs saying they condemn the United States and urging the ambassador, Harry Harris, to \"leave this land.\"\n\n\"What the U.S. has done is kill, rape, poison our land and threaten our people's lives,\" one student shouted.\n\nThe protest, seen in videos online, was related to a sharp increase in defense costs for the 28,500 U.S. forces stationed in South Korea. In February, the country agreed it would contribute about 1 trillion won \u2014 $880 million \u2014 toward the troops for 2019, an 8.2% increase from 2018.
