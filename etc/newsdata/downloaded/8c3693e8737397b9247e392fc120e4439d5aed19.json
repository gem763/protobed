Meanwhile, millions of residents remained without power after the state's largest utility cut electricity as a precaution to prevent more areas from igniting.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement that officials are deploying \"every resource available\" to respond to the wildfires, including a large blaze in Northern California's wine country powered by gusts that reached more than 164 km/h.\n\nThe Sonoma County Sheriff's Office tweeted that it's the largest evacuation that any member of the force can remember. The evacuation order was significantly expanded overnight to portions of Santa Rosa, Calif., a city of 175,000 that was hit hard two years ago by a wildfire that destroyed thousands of homes and killed 22 people.\n\nThe evacuation order affects the northwestern section of the city. Fire officials said they are concerned the winds will blow embers and cause the fire to jump a major highway and spread to population centres.\n\nWatch as residents flee from the Kincade Fire in Northern California:\n\nDramatic video shows the wind-driven Kincade Fire burning north of San Francisco as firefighters battle the flames and residents attempt to escape. 1:11\n\nEvacuation orders were issued for parts of Santa Rosa on Sunday as firefighters struggled to beat back a wind-driven wildfire that started in Northern California's wine country four days ago. The state's largest utility company shut power to 2.3 million people to prevent additional wildfires.\n\nPacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) started shutting off power on Saturday around 5 p.m. PT for customers in 38 counties and said the electricity could remain off for 48 hours or longer. Concern that gusts could knock down power lines and spark devastating wildfires prompted two blackouts in California in recent weeks.\n\nThe wind-driven Kincade Fire burns near the town of Healdsburg early Sunday. (Stephen Lam/Reuters)\n\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, winds toppled trees and knocked out power to areas where the utility had not shut off power. The gusts knocked over a nine-metre tree at a farmers' market in Martinez, injuring nine people, including a toddler. Six were taken to a hospital but the injuries were not life-threatening, police said.\n\nCalifornia fire officials said the current wildfire, dubbed the Kincade Fire, that began Wednesday night has burned at least 100 square kilometres and is only 10 per cent contained.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said wind gusts topped 140 km/h Sunday morning in Healdsburg Hills North, a city in California's wine country.\n\nWatch as firefighters battle the flames:\n\nFirefighters near San Francisco battle the Kincade Fire from the air and on the ground. 0:59\n\nGusts stronger than 2017, expected to last longer\n\nDuring the 2017 fires, winds up to 144 km/h lasted for about 12 hours. This time, the gusts were stronger and expected to last more than 36 hours, ending Monday night, said Matt Mehle, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Monterey office.\n\nWindy could blow embers and spark fires up to a mile away. Fire officials said they feared that if the Kincade Fire crosses U.S. 101, it could ignite an area that hasn't burned in 80 years.\n\n\"The fuel in that area is extremely dense, they're extremely old and dry,\" said Steve Volmer, a fire behaviour analyst with Cal Fire.\n\nThe parched vegetation from the unseasonably hot weather and low humidity was already igniting spots elsewhere, and firefighters scrambled to keep up.\n\nEven before the new blackout order, the University of California, Berkeley announced it was cancelling all Saturday afternoon classes, as well as other indoor events and activities scheduled through Sunday.\n\nA firefighter from Dry Creek Rancheria carries a flag he removed from a building as the Kincade Fire bears down on Healdsburg. (Noah Berger/The Associated Press)\n\nSmoke from a second wildfire in the Bay Area briefly halted traffic on a bridge. The flames came dangerously close to homes in Vallejo. In the south, a wildfire in the Santa Clarita area north of Los Angeles has destroyed 18 structures. As of Sunday, the Tick Fire was 65 per cent contained.\n\nSaturday night's evacuation order encompassed a huge swath of wine country stretching from the inland community of Healdsburg west through the Russian River Valley and to Bodega Bay on the coast, Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick said. An even broader area was put under a warning for residents to get ready to leave at a moment's notice.\n\nThe sheriff pleaded with residents in the evacuation zone to get out immediately, citing the lives lost when a wildfire swept through the region two years ago.\n\n\"I'm seeing people reporting that they're going to stay and fight this fire,\" Essick said. \"You cannot fight this. Please evacuate.\"\n\nThe wind event was expected to peak early Sunday and would likely be the strongest in several years, said PG&E meteorologist Scott Strenfel. He said Saturday that falling trees and breaking branches were likely. Relative humidity will dip into single digits, he said", "description": "Authorities say 180,000 people have been ordered to leave their homes as powerful winds threaten to spread a wildfire in Northern California's wine country, while Gov.
