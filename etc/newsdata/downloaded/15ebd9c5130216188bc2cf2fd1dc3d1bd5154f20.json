Photo: Lars Niki/Getty Images\n\nExtra, extra! Read all about it! Wes Anderson\u2019s upcoming film, The French Dispatch, stars Frances McDormand and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet among many, many other names, but until now, hardly anything was known about the auteur\u2019s follow-up to Isle of Dogs. Now that The French Dispatch has been acquired for worldwide distribution by Fox Searchlight, we have questions! And only a few of the questions are different ways of asking, \u201cDid Greta Gerwig, who was in Isle, introduce Anderson to Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet?\u201d\n\nThe French Dispatch is more than the title of the film. It\u2019s the magazine American journalists have set up in a fictional French town during the 20th century. The film \u201cbrings to life a collection of stories published in \u2018The French Dispatch\u2019 magazine,\u201d according to a press release. Benicio Del Toro, Jeffrey Wright, Adrien Brody, L\u00e9a Seydoux, Tilda Swinton, Mathieu Amalric, Lyna Khoudri, Stephen Park, Owen Wilson, and Bill Murray will join McDormand and Chalamet as they weave together three stories, flitting around Anderson\u2019s undoubtedly breathtaking rendition of a French city. Also, according to fan photos of the production, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet has a mustache! Watch for that comedy alone when The French Dispatch premieres in 2020.", "description": "Frances McDormand, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Jeffrey Wright, Adrien Brody and more star in Wes Anderson\u2019s \u2018The French Dispatch.\u2019 So, what is it about?", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/19/19-wes-anderson.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
