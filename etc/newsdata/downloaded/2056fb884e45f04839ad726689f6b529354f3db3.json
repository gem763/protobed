AMZN is set to report third-quarter results today, after market close. It has been a topsy-turvy journey for Amazon so far this year. After the company\u2019s shares touched a 52-week high in mid-July, it nosedived on a second-quarter earnings miss. In fact, its stock has declined 10.6% over the past three-month period.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes this mean Amazon is a bargain now, and you should buy its shares ahead of the earnings release? The answer is not really! After all, Wall Street analysts\u2019 view on Amazon\u2019s third-quarter performance points to mixed results. Here\u2019s why \u2013\n\nJeff Bezos\u2019 company had already declared that its Prime Day sales in July were \u201conce again the largest shopping event in Amazon history.\u201d In fact, sales rose 2.8% at Internet retailers in July mostly due to significant spending during the Amazon Prime Day period, according to the Commerce Department.\n\nFurther, the event was longer this time around. The sale took place for 48 hours in 2019, up from 36 hours in 2018. Nonetheless, such promising sales figures should get reflected in the company\u2019s third-quarter results.\n\nBy the way, the biggest contributor toward Amazon\u2019s success is its growth in cloud computing operations. Its Amazon Web Services (AWS) is well ahead of rivals Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Oracle Corporation ORCL.\n\nAWS basically offers corporations and individuals to use its cloud services to operate websites, databases and various other programs. AWS single-handily contributed to more than 13% of Amazon\u2019s revenues in the second quarter. Revenues from the AWS segment went up 37% on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter.\n\nAnd with digital transformation continuing to take place in the current scenario, AWS will certainly be an industry leader. Thus, it\u2019s expected that AWS will contribute toward the company\u2019s revenue growth in the third quarter. Analysts now expect the company\u2019s revenues for the third quarter to jump to $68.57 billion from $56.58 billion a year ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, there are concerns about the cost of one-day shipping. In order to deliver at a brisk pace, Amazon has shortened its standard two-day shopping option for several of its products to one-day. In April, the company had said that faster shipping will be available for nearly 100 million items that were earlier shipped within two days.", "description": "Analysts' view on Amazon's (AMZN) Q3 performance points to mixed results. While Amazon Web Services are expected to improve revenues, uptick in costs associated with one-day shipping is a dampener.", "authors": ["Tirthankar Chakraborty"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_7x.7a4i0gRybs8DntBB6A--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/399c9de73edc19309624ed978063a64f", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
