The ice cream machine was never broke, it just takes 3 hours to clean so we used to say it was broke so we didn't have to serve you lot. Cheers x'\n\nAnother former worker said it was 'always working' but just 'took too long to clean' so they told people it was broken, in the Tweet which has been shared more than 10,000 times.\n\nA heated debate has erupted about why the ice-cream machines at McDonald's appear broken, on Twitter. Some former employees have jumped to the defence of staff and said others 'don't understand' that the machines cannot be used at all during a cleaning cycle. It is 'easier' to say it is broken (file image)\n\nPeople 'don't understand' that the machine cannot be used at all during a cleaning cycle and it is more complicated than just 'wiping it down'. This means it is 'easier' to say it is broken, says Eleanor in the Twitter thread.\n\nShe added: 'Unless you work for the company you don\u2019t understand. It seems dumb but it\u2019s genuinely easier to lie to avoid having the same conversation 10000 times a day.'\n\nFormer employee Megan Wojcik said: 'Or someone would accidentally press the weird heat button which spoiled the ice cream/shakes so it had to be cleaned.'\n\nTwitter user TheGrizzlyBanjo said: 'I\u2019m copying this information so the next time McDonalds does that I will show them this tweet.'\n\nAndizzle asked: 'I don't understand why you couldn't say it's being cleaned or maintenanced.'\n\nThe machines which make the McFlurry's (pictured) are cleaned every 24 hours, according to a McDonald's spokesman\n\nKat wrote: 'Bf recently worked there... can confirm the absolute truth in this! And that barely anyone knows how to actually clean it.'\n\nMegan Pears added: 'Will take all McDonald\u2019s secrets to the grave.'\n\nRhys Thomas wrote: 'Question is, why are they making machines for fast food chains that take 3 hours to clean.'\n\nMcDonald's told the Mirror that machines are cleaned every 24 hours and apologised for any inconvenience.\n\nThey claimed the shake and soft-serve machines 'undergo heat treatment cycles' which involve them being 'disassembled sanitized and cleaned every 14 days'.", "description": "Will Doyle revealed that McDonald's ice cream machines appear broken because staff can not be bothered to clean them.
