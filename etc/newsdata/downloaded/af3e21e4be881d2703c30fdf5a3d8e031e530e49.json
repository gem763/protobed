After receiving a call to a non-emergency number requesting that police check on a neighbor\u2019s house that had its doors open and its lights on, police approach silently. They look into an open door and into a brightly lit room, but they don\u2019t say anything. They then creep around the house, moving from light to dark. They use a flashlight. They keep moving around the edges of the house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuddenly, in a mere moment, one of them spots movement in a window. The officer yells for the shadowy figure to put up her hands and then immediately fires a shot. Atatiana Jefferson was dead. She was 28 years old. According to her family\u2019s lawyer, she was playing video games with her young nephew when they heard \u201crustling\u201d outside and \u201csaw flashlights.\u201d There was a gun in the house, but there\u2019s no indication (yet) that she was holding it in her hand.\n\nBut what if she was? Does a homeowner not have a right to investigate someone lurking on her property? Can she not arm herself at 2:30 a.m. when she hears a strange sound in the darkness?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve been looking closely at the police-shooting issue for many years, and I\u2019m noticing a trend in many of the worst and most controversial shootings. The police make mistakes that heighten their own sense of danger, and then they \u201cresolve\u201d their own error by opening fire.\n\nThe examples are easy to find. The worst and most recent is that of Dallas officer Amber Guyger, who made the dreadful mistake of entering the wrong house and then immediately dealt with the perceived \u201cthreat\u201d by shooting the innocent man inside.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Guyger is hardly the only offender. Who can forget the terrible shooting of Philando Castile, gunned down as he tried to comply with conflicting commands from an obviously panicked officer \u2014 the officer told Castile to hand over his license and proof of insurance, but also to not reach for his gun. He shot Castile to death even as Castile was calmly telling him that he wasn\u2019t reaching for his gun.\n\nThen there\u2019s the extraordinarily gut-wrenching video of a cop killing Daniel Shaver as he sobbed and begged for his life. The officer\u2019s instructions were utterly incomprehensible. He told Shaver to not put his hands down for any reason. He also told him to crawl down the hall..\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo one should forget Andrew Scott. Police seeking a suspect showed up at the wrong house (without a warrant), did not turn on their lights, did not identify themselves as police, and pounded violently on the door late at night. When Scott answered his own door with a firearm in his hand, he was instantly shot dead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the tragic death of Willie McCoy that the trend truly became obvious. McCoy was sleeping in his car, blocking a drive-through window, with a gun in his lap. When he began to move, cops clustered around his car started screaming at him so loudly that the transcript of the video has to explain that the shouts weren\u2019t gunshots. Then, within three seconds, the officers riddled him with bullets. They startled him awake, and then killed him.\n\nIn response, I wrote this:\n\nWhen we evaluate police shootings, we wrongly tend to limit our analysis to the very instant of the shooting itself. The question of a cop\u2019s reasonable fear at that instant is allowed to trump all other concerns, and becomes the deciding factor at trial. I would argue, however, that officers act unreasonably when they don\u2019t give a citizen a reasonable chance to live \u2014 and giving a citizen a reasonable chance to live involves properly handling the situation so no weapon need be fired.\n\nWould Atatiana Jefferson still be alive if the cops had parked in front of her house and clearly identified themselves by shouting into the open door? Would they still be alive had they not lurked around a person\u2019s home without permission \u2014 exactly like a person who was trespassing, perhaps with malign intent?\n\nThere is absolutely no question that police have a difficult job. There is no question that even routine encounters and wellness checks can \u2014 on rare occasions \u2014 escalate to deadly violence. But there is also no question that time and again police have enhanced the risk to the public through their own mistakes. Poor tactics can yield terrible results, and police should not be able to use the \u201csplit-second decision\u201d defense when they created the crisis.\n\nThere is no greater violation of liberty than the loss of your own life in your own home at the hands of misguided, panicky, or poorly trained agents of the state.
