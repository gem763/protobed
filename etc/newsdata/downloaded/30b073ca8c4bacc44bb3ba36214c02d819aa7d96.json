Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected sales to fall 1.1% last month.\n\nThe August gain, which came after July marked the first year-over-year uptick in 17 months, strengthened the case that some of the lowest mortgage rates of the past 50 years may at last be luring more buyers back into the market, economists said. For months, they have grappled with why ultralow borrowing rates, strong employment and rising wages have failed to spark more home buying.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Have you sold or bought a home recently? How was that experience? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cJust perhaps we may have turned a corner for good in terms of home sales, which had been underperforming in relation to jobs, mortgage rates and other factors,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, NAR\u2019s chief economist.\n\nAnnually, sales in August were up 2.6%, the second month of growth following 16 straight months of declines. Purchases of previously owned homes account for most of U.S. homebuying.\n\nAverage fixed mortgage rates for 30-year loans were 3.73% in the latest week, down from close to 5% in November, according to Freddie Mac . Mortgage applications for home purchases have risen for three straight weeks, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, and housing starts were up more than 12% in August. That marked the biggest monthly gain for new-home construction since 2007.\n\nBut significant headwinds remain. For one, the price of homes available for sale continues to rise. The median sales price in August was $278,200, up 4.7% from a year ago, marking the 90th consecutive month of price increases on an annual basis. The number of homes available for sale meanwhile fell in August. The shortage has also been propping up prices, NAR\u2019s Yun said.\n\n\u201cGiven the other constraints that buyers face\u2014tight inventory and strained affordability\u2014their enthusiasm for low rates is bound to be muffled, which explains why August existing sales gained only modestly,\u201d said Matthew Speakman, economist at Zillow. \u201cEven stronger sales volumes may be around the corner given that mortgage rates plummeted in August.\u201d\n\nA dearth of affordable single-family supply is a persistent issue across markets, despite the recent bump in home building.\n\nConcerns that the U.S. economy might be headed for a recession and uncertainty about how trade disputes with China will affect the economy are also deterring some buyers, economists and realtors have said for several months now.\n\nYet for those who can afford it, risings rents that continue to break price records nationwide are starting to nudge some renters to consider homeownership more seriously.\n\nHeather Hernandez, 30 years old, who recently bought a house for about $267,000 in northern Virginia, said she and her husband were motivated to buy after comparing their current rent with home mortgages.\n\n\u201cWe found a mortgage was basically the same as renting an apartment, even could be slightly cheaper than renting an apartment in this area,\u201d she said.\n\nThat lower cost came at the expense of location, however. Ms. Hernandez said she and her husband had to move further away from their preferred location to afford a home.\n\nHome sales in southern states increased 3.6% on the year ended in August, making it the region with the largest annual growth in sales volume. Prices there rose 5.4% over the same period. In the West, where sales prices are highest, the number of sales rose 1.8% over the past year and the median home price rose 5.7% to $415,900.\n\nNews Corp , owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors.\n\n\u2014Laura Kusisto and Likhitha Butchireddygari contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Will Parker at will.parker@wsj.com and David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com", "description": "August was the strongest month for sales of U.S. homes in nearly a year and a half, sparking fresh hope that a protracted slump in the housing market may finally be starting to reverse.", "authors": ["Will Parker", "David Harrison", "David.Harrison Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108308/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
