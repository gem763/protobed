It also implicates William Barr.", "language": "en", "text": "Taylor\u2019s key mention of Barr comes in a very damning passage. Taylor recounted that he\u2019d learned that Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, had informed Ukraine that the frozen military aid would be conditioned on launching the \u201cinvestigations\u201d Trump wanted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTaylor then testified that on a call, Sondland stated that Trump told him he wanted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to \u201cpublicly\u201d pledge investigations \u2014 which would undercut the fact of Russian sabotage of the 2016 election and help smear potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden. Taylor claimed Sondland told him the money was dependent on this.\n\nTaylor then adds:\n\nWe also discussed the possibility that the Ukrainian Prosecutor General, rather than President Zelenskyy, would make a statement about investigations, potentially in coordination with Attorney General Barr\u2019s probe into the investigation of interference in the 2016 elections.\n\nTwo senior U.S. officials seriously discussed a plan in which the attorney general of the United States would publicly coordinate with a foreign government to help Trump absolve Russia of culpability for an attack on our political system, by helping to repudiate our intelligence services\u2019 conclusion about that culpability.\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s the goal of Trump\u2019s demand for Ukraine\u2019s investigation into 2016 \u2014 to validate a conspiracy theory which holds that Ukraine hacked Democrats\u2019 emails and set up Russia to get blamed for sabotaging the election for Trump.\n\nAD\n\nTo understand why this matters \u2014 and why it\u2019s so ominous \u2014 we need a quick recap.\n\nBarr keeps popping up in this scheme\n\nOn his July 25 call, Trump pressured Zelensky to help validate the 2016 Ukraine conspiracy theory and to help smear Biden \u2014 and instructed Zelensky to work with Barr to get it done. After the partial call transcript was released, the Justice Department denied that Trump had directed Barr to do this.\n\nThen acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney also implicated Barr. Mulvaney defended Trump\u2019s demand for Ukraine to investigate the 2016 conspiracy theory by suggesting it was legitimate to ask Ukraine to help with an \u201congoing investigation\u201d by the Justice Department.\n\nAD\n\nThat was a reference to the fact that Barr is reviewing the legitimacy of the origins of the Russia investigation. That, of course, is something Trump hopes will discredit that investigation, along with his efforts to get Ukraine to cast doubt on its findings.\n\nAD\n\nOnce again, the Justice Department denied the implications of Mulvaney\u2019s claim, asserting there was no quid pro quo to compel Ukraine to cooperate with Barr\u2019s review.\n\nThis pattern is already problematic. Barr wants his review into the origins of the FBI investigation (which became the special counsel probe) to be seen as legitimate and apolitical.\n\nBut inconvenient facts keep tying it directly to Trump\u2019s corrupt efforts to pressure Ukraine to validate 2016 conspiracy theories, casting serious doubt on its legitimacy, and making it look like an effort to carry out Trump\u2019s corrupt political demands.\n\nAD\n\nNow that has happened again. If Taylor is right, Sondland \u2014 who has been taking direction from Trump \u2014 seriously discussed the prospect of Barr actively validating Ukraine\u2019s \u201cinvestigation\u201d by making a joint statement about it with Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nThis happened, we now know, at a time when the military aid was being withheld to make that investigation happen.\n\nConsider: Trump himself, his chief of staff and the ringleader of his whole scheme (Sondland) have all apparently connected Barr\u2019s review directly to Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine. That suggests there\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know about the overlap between the two.\n\nThis comes after the Justice Department tried to keep this whole corrupt plot buried, by advising the acting director of national intelligence not to transmit the whistleblower complaint sounding the alarm about it to Congress.\n\nAD\n\nThe Justice Department also declined to investigate the whistleblower\u2019s charges even after a CIA lawyer made a criminal referral of them \u2014 which should also be revisited in light of what we now know from Taylor\u2019s revelations.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why the Justice Department has been so nervous and jumpy about Ukraine, and why they\u2019ve distanced from this every time they have the chance,\u201d former Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller told me. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s more yet to come out.\u201d\n\nAt a minimum, as Jack Goldsmith notes, you\u2019d think the Justice Department would go further in flatly declaring that Barr\u2019s review is in no way associated with Trump\u2019s corrupt Ukraine machinations, and with Trump\u2019s (and Mulvaney\u2019s) use of the Justice Department to confer legitimacy on them, to avoid further tainting Barr\u2019s review.\n\nAD\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: We can\u2019t rule out the possibility that Barr\u2019s review will be just as nakedly political as what Trump is doing. The Justice Department has announced that the review is vaguely looking into Ukraine\u2019s role in 2016. And Barr has already worked to enlist other foreign governments in this effort.\n\nAD\n\nSo is it that far-fetched that involving Ukraine was really part of the plan?\n\nAll this is ominous. Trump\u2019s propaganda has been about distracting from the steady drumbeat of actual revelations by casting doubt on process \u2014 the whistleblower is discredited, impeachment is a coup, etc.\n\nJust as Barr employed base dishonesty to misrepresent the special counsel\u2019s findings, so one can easily see Barr releasing the findings of his review right when impeachment hits a climax, to spread around further fog and confusion.\n\nAD\n\nThe fact that Sondland was apparently discussing something so blatant as having Barr validate Ukraine\u2019s sham investigation as part of Trump\u2019s corrupt scheme should prompt us to redouble the questions about Barr\u2019s role here.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Taylor's explosive testimony implicates William Barr \u2014 and previews something ominous to come from Trump.", "authors": ["Greg Sargent", "Opinion Writer Covering National Politics", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/55-EcBFh74k_PqXE8N2ANTeUedk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3YT27QHVTYI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
