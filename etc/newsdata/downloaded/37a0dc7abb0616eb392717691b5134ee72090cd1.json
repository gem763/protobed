Ronny Alexander, who runs the board-game review site Co-op Board Games, calls it \u201cone of the best-looking board games in existence.\u201d Dr. Michael James Heron of Meeple Like Us agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s full of some of the most beautiful, creepy, and sinister art you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d The premise revolves around a haunted mansion, whose new owner invites a group of mediums to rid the house of its undead residents. One person plays as a ghost who has to pass clues to the other players, who all play as psychics attempting to solve the mystery of the ghost\u2019s murder and help him pass on to the other side. According to Alexander, Mysterium combines elements of deduction games like Clue, as well as cooperative games like Pandemic, and can accommodate two to seven players.", "description": "We asked experts to recommend the best board games for Halloween parties, including Mysterium, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, Horrified, Shadows in the Forest , Mansions of Madness , Mythos Tales, Deception: Murder in Hong Kong and Campy Creatures.", "authors": ["Dominique Pariso"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/10/01/board-game-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
