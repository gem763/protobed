Saturn now has 82 known moons, whereas Jupiter has a paltry 79.\n\nAnnounced at the International Astronomical Union\u2019s Minor Planet Centre by a team of astronomers from the Carnegie Institute for Science led by Scott S. Sheppard, the discovery is the latest advance in the 400-year history of our understanding of the satellites of our neighbouring planets.\n\nAs technology has improved, we have observed more and more of these tiny, distant worlds \u2013 and we can be reasonably confident there are still plenty waiting to be discovered.\n\nHow do we even know Saturn has moons?\n\nAlthough most planets of the Solar system are visible to the naked eye and have been known to humans since antiquity, it wasn\u2019t until Galileo Galilei turned a telescope on Jupiter in 1610 that we discovered Earth was not alone in having an orbiting companion.\n\nGalileo saw Jupiter\u2019s four largest moons and could make out what we now know are Saturn\u2019s rings. Decades later, with better telescopes, Christian Huygens and Giovanni Domenico Cassini observed Saturn\u2019s moons.\n\nIt became clear that the giant planets are surrounded by multitudes of satellites, resembling smaller versions of the Solar system. By the middle of the 19th century, telescopes had improved enough that the first eight moons of Saturn \u2013 including Titan, the largest \u2013 had been viewed directly.\n\nThe introduction of photographic plates, which enabled the detection of fainter objects with long-exposure observations, helped astronomers increase their count of Saturn\u2019s moons to 14.\n\nCloser inspections\n\nIt was a long journey (literally) to the next big improvement in our view of Saturn\u2019s moons. Many of the smaller moons were not discovered until the Voyager fly-by missions in the 1980s and the more recent 13-year stopover of the Cassini spacecraft in Saturn\u2019s orbit.\n\nUntil these closer visits, we knew little about the moons aside from the fact that they existed.\n\nOne of Cassini\u2019s goals was to explore Titan, which is the only moon in the Solar system with a thick, smoggy atmosphere. Another was to take a look at Saturn\u2019s other mid-sized moons, including frozen Enceladus, which may hold an ocean of liquid water beneath its icy crust.\n\nCassini also discovered much smaller moons, so-called \u201cshepherd moons\u201d that interact with Saturn\u2019s rings by carving gaps and wavy patterns as they pass through a rubble of rocks and snowballs.\n\nBigger telescopes, more moons\n\nThese close-up observations from space advanced our understanding of individual moons that stay near to Saturn. Recently, many more moons have been found in orbits much further from the planet.\n\nThese more distant moons could only be detected with large optical telescopes such as the Subaru telescope at Mauna Kea in Hawaii. The telescope is equipped with sensitive cameras that can detect some of the faint objects separated by millions of kilometres from Saturn.\n\nScott Sheppard\n\nTo confirm that these objects are indeed associated with Saturn, astronomers have to observe them over days or even months to reconstruct the shape and size of the moon\u2019s orbit.\n\nMany small moons are fragments of shattered large moons\n\nSuch observations revealed a population of moons that are often described as \u201cirregular\u201d moons. They are split into three distinct groups: Inuit, Gallic, and Norse. They all have large, elliptical orbits at an angle to those of moons closer to the planet.\n\nEach group is thought to have formed from a collision or fragmentation of a larger moon. The Norse group consists of some of the most distant moons of Saturn, which orbit in the opposite direction to the rotation of the planet. This suggests they could have formed elsewhere and were later captured by the gravitational force of Saturn.\n\nOf the 20 new moons, 17 belong to the Norse group including the furthest known moon from the planet. Their estimated sizes are of the order of 5km in diameter.\n\nHave we found all the moons now?\n\nAre we likely to find even more moons around Saturn? Absolutely.\n\nSome of the newly discovered moons are very faint and at the limit of detection with currently available instruments. New, bigger telescopes such as Giant Magellan Telescope will allow us to observe even fainter objects.\n\nIn the meantime, the 20 new moons need names. Carnegie Science has invited everyone to help.\n\nLucyna Kedziora-Chudczer, Program Manager / Adjunct Research Fellow, Swinburne University of Technology\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
