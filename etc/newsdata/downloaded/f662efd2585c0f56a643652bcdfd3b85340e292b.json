The child star left school in third grade to become a massive actress and turns out that\u2019s not coming in handy as she tried to help her kid with homework this week.\n\nThe Younger actress, 32, left \u2018real\u2019 school in order to become a star on Lizzie McGuire way back as a pre-teen.\n\nNow she\u2019s lamented her home-schooling days on set and while travelling, as she struggled to aid young son, Luca, seven, in his maths.\n\nTo be fair, we didn\u2019t leave school at 13 and would still more than likely have a hard time picking up the algebra after all these years.\n\nPosing alongside her kid \u2013 she also shares baby Banks, who will turn one later this month, with partner Matthew Koma \u2013 Hilary pulled a face as they attempted to hit the books.\n\nHilary is set to reprise her role at Lizzie (Picture: Getty Images North America)\n\n\u2018This guy with his spirit and kindness\ud83d\udc94Homework is already no joke in 2nd grade,\u2019 Hilary wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I stopped going to \u201creal\u201d school in 3rd grade so I\u2019m actually doomed\u2026\n\n\u2018I am left scratching my head all the time looking at his homework and I\u2019m terrified for next year!\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018Although Singapore math is the sh*t\u2026.also learned a lot about tick birds this week.\u2019\n\nHey, the more you know.\n\nThe actress became a star from the age of 10 when she scored a big break playing Wendy the witch in 1998\u2019s Casper Meets Wendy.\n\nWith partner Matthew Koma (Picture: FilmMagic)\n\nFrom there she became a household name in her Disney Channel Show Lizzie McGuire, which ran from 2001 to 2004.\n\nThe hit teen show is soon to be rebooted on Disney+. And what\u2019s more, lead star Hilary is hinting former leading man Adam Lamberg might join her on the revival.\n\n\u2018I really hope he\u2019s going to be involved,\u2019 an excited Hilary enthused in a new interview.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve been planning out the season and coming up with what everything looks like, and it\u2019s so important for him to be there for part of it.\u2019\n\nHilary famously played titular character Elizabeth, while Adam played David \u2018Gordo\u2019 Gordon.\n\nLizzie McGuire ended back in 2004 when Hilary was 16 years old and will pick things up around the same as age as what Lizzie will be now, in her early 30s.\n\n\u2018Finally being in my 30s, it felt like a good time to revisit her,\u2019 said Hilary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a complicated stage. That\u2019s what people loved about Lizzie so much \u2014 that phase of becoming a teenager. It\u2019s such a complicated but fun part of time to navigate. She was everyone\u2019s best friend.\n\n\u2018She was faced with every challenge that was relatable. Now, I think stepping into the role as a 30-year-old trying to navigate life is equally interesting. Or more specifically, waking up on your 30th birthday and thinking, this isn\u2019t how I planned this to look, what do I do now? That\u2019s an interesting story to me.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
