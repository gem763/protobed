Giuliani said he was hired to consult on Fraud Guarantee's technologies and provide legal advice on regulatory issues.\n\nFederal prosecutors are \"examining Giuliani's interactions\" with Parnas and another Giuliani associate, Igor Fruman, who was also indicted on campaign finance charges, a law enforcement source told Reuters on Sunday.\n\nThe New York Times reported last week that Parnas had told associates he paid Giuliani hundreds of thousands of dollars for what Giuliani said was business and legal advice. Giuliani said for the first time on Monday that the total amount was $500,000.\n\nGiuliani told Reuters the money came in two payments made within weeks of each other. He said he could not recall the dates of the payments. He said most of the work he did for Fraud Guarantee was completed in 2018 but that he had been doing follow-up for over a year.\n\nParnas and Fruman were arrested at Dulles Airport outside Washington last week on charges they funneled foreign money to unnamed U.S. politicians in a bid to influence U.S.-Ukraine relations in violation of U.S. campaign finance laws. The men were preparing to board a plane to Europe.\n\nRead more: Rudy Giuliani was reportedly retained for 'hundreds of thousands of dollars' by an associate's firm Fraud Guarantee\n\nAccording to an indictment unsealed by U.S. prosecutors, an unidentified Russian businessman arranged for two $500,000 wires to be sent from foreign bank accounts to a U.S. account controlled by Fruman in September and October 2018. The money was used, in part, by Fruman, Parnas and two other men charged in the indictment to gain influence with U.S. politicians and candidates, the indictment said.\n\nForeign nationals are prohibited from making contributions and other expenditures in connection with U.S. elections, and from making contributions in someone else's name.\n\nGiuliani said he was confident that the money he received was from \"a domestic source,\" but he would not say where it came from.\n\n\"I know beyond any doubt the source of the money is not any questionable source,\" he told Reuters in an interview. \"The money did not come from foreigners. I can rule that out 100%,\" he said.\n\nHe declined to say whether the money had been paid directly to him by Fraud Guarantee or from another source.\n\nJohn Dowd, a lawyer for Parnas and Fruman, also would not discuss the source of the funding that Giuliani said he received for his work for Fraud Guarantee. \"What I know is privileged,\" Dowd said.\n\n(Reporting by Karen Freifeld and Aram Roston,; Additional reporting by Mark Hosenball; Editing by Ross Colvin and Marla Dickerson)", "description": "Rudy Giuliani did for the company co-founded by the Ukrainian-American businessman Lev Parnas, who was arrested last week on campaign finance charges.", "authors": ["Karen Freifeld", "Aram Roston"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da545d7cc4a0a7b99762792?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
