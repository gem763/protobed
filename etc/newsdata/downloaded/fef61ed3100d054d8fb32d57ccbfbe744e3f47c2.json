After the last fight, I want to come back with an A-class performance.\n\n\"Selby, Frampton were fights of the year but the last one was a cuddling contest. You want to have a win, but you don\u2019t want to be having the equivalent of a 1-0 win on a cold Monday night.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\u201cYou want to be having a thriller, dominating the game for 90 minutes. I want to be in entertaining fights and win in spectacular fashion.\u201d\n\nWarrington, who is unbeaten in 29, is a heavy favourite for Saturday's showdown but he insists he isn't getting complacent.\n\nHe added: \u201cTakoucht is coming here to try to take the titles away from me, to stop want I want to achieve. If I want to entice the world champions into a big fight then I have to beat him in style.\n\n\u201cHe can go back home being a hero, he would turn his career around. I understand how fighters get complacent, but I don\u2019t let that happen. We are on a mission. For me to carry on that mission, I\u2019ve got to win.\u201d", "description": "Warrington defends his IBF featherweight world title for the third time against the unfancied Frenchman in Leeds on Saturday night", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20548632.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Josh-Warrington-and-Sofiane-Takoucht-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
