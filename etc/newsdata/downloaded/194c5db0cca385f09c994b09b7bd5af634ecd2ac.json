It's not trying to make it urgent or pompous and unapproachable.\n\n'It's about approachability, and about saying, 'Just talk about it with your mates if you're worried'.\n\nHe encouraged men who might be worried about a personal or mental health issue, to 'just talk about it with your mates'.\n\nBen Miller (left) dressed as Bruce Grobbelaar and Dev Griffin (right), dressed as Daley Thompson\n\n'You might find either you've identified the problem and it's gone away as a result or you've identified the problem and you can plan a course of action to resolve it', he added.\n\nIn 2006 Hammond was injured in a crash that left him in a coma for two weeks and with brain injuries after he crashed a jet-powered car at an airfield.\n\nIwan Thomas (pictured above) dressed as Ian Botham\n\nCelebrities who have also lent a hand to support the campaign include Iwan Thomas, dressed as Sir Ian Botham and comedian and actor Ben Miller, who imitates his childhood hero, former footballer Bruce Grobbelaar.\n\nRadio 1 DJ and former Strictly star Dev Griffin transforms himself into decathlete Daley Thompson, while boxer Luke Campbell is pictured as retired boxer Barry McGuigan.\n\nMiller said it was his second year supporting Movember and claimed he had also dressed up last year as Salvador Dali.\n\nHe added that this year he decided to sport Bruce Grobbelaar.\n\n'As a young lad growing up in Crewe, I used to watch him playing on the practice field.\n\n'Bruce Grobbelaar that is, not Salvador Dali. There were no melting clocks anywhere in sight. Anyway, I definitely prefer this look.'\n\nHe added: 'It's now important more than ever for men and all to come together, grow a mo and raise as much money as possible.\n\n'No matter what you type of moustache you sport this year, your efforts will make a huge difference.'\n\nMovember was launched in 2003 and over the years the men's health movement has gained six million supports across the world, helping 1,250 innovative men's health projects across 20 countries.\n\nMovember's executive director Simon Traynor said: 'This incredible and fun campaign was the perfect way for us to inspire as many people as possible to get involved in Movember this year.\n\n'We have welcomed our stars to re-create a variety of sporting legends who made their own mos cool.\n\n'We want to inspire men to not feel embarrassed by their facial hair, whatever you grow will save a bro.\n\n'We want men to know that no matter what you grow, your moustaches will save lives.'\n\nSign up for Movember at www.movember.com/sportsmo", "description": "Famous faces from across the UK have dressed up as mustachioed sporting legends in support of the annual Movember campaign.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/23/20304006-0-image-a-31_1572305187229.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
