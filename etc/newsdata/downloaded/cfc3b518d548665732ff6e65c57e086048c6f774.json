She would make others laugh by doing a dance or giving an impromptu hug, even as she grew convinced that she had to leave her abusive environment while still working two jobs to get by.\n\nAD\n\nStephanie Gudger, one of the few people Rodriguez confided in, said they drove around on Tuesday night discussing how Rodriguez could leave and get to a safe place with the children. She told Gudger she was being abused, but she never called police, afraid, her friend said, that the children would be split up. The couple had a 7-year-old son together; she had two children from a previous relationship, and he had one.\n\nAD\n\nAntonika Johnson, a friend who lives in an apartment below Rodriguez\u2019s, said she heard noises that sounded like muffled gunshots about 4:45 a.m. Wednesday, but she dismissed them. She and Gudger said the children were home at the time Rodriguez was shot, but they apparently did not see or hear the incident.\n\nThey said Aughtry took the children to school before he apparently took his own life, an account confirmed by D.C. police. Officers, called by someone concerned for Rodriguez\u2019s safety, found her body about 8 a.m.\n\nAD\n\nJohnson said she wished she had done more to persuade Rodriguez to seek help. \u201cI could have saved her,\u201d she said.\n\nShe recalled how Rodriguez helped her furnish her apartment when she moved in, even ordering a sofa for her online. The two laughed together. And danced together. Cooked dinner together. Their children played together. \u201cShe was the life of the party,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cShe was a good cook. She could do hair. She loved the color red.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut the friend said she heard loud arguments between Rodriguez and Aughtry and once witnessed physical abuse by the husband.\n\nRodriguez began working for Catholic Charities seven years ago, starting as receptionist at the downtown office, where she greeted everyone from deep-pocketed donors to the penniless seeking bus fare, and then migrating to the men\u2019s shelter on the grounds of St. Elizabeths Hospital, which can accommodate 380 people a night.\n\nAD\n\nWhether feeding her children or feeding the homeless, Rodriguez thought atmosphere mattered. She served Thanksgiving dinner at home on good china, and when she helped with holiday meals on tables outside Catholic Charities\u2019 central office, she insisted that those guests weren\u2019t given disposable plates.\n\nA former co-worker, Christabel L. Estrada, recalled her saying, \u201cEveryone deserves to eat off fancy plates.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEstrada said Rodriguez \u201ctreated everybody with respect\u201d and kept up her inspirational ways even as her life got harder. \u201cClearly, she was going through a lot of personal issues,\u201d Estrada said. \u201cYet you would never know it. She would walk around making you feel good without sharing the hardship she was enduring.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "A D.C. shelter worker who police say was killed by her husband is recalled as inspirational even though she had troubles at home.", "authors": ["Peter Hermann", "Reporter Covering Crime", "Specifically The D.C.
