REUTERS/Edgar Su/Files\n\nMalaysia is the world\u2019s second largest producer and exporter of palm oil after Indonesia, and the edible oil contributed to 2.8% of its gross domestic product last year. Malaysian palm oil futures fell for a third straight session on Tuesday, hitting their lowest in nearly two weeks.\n\n\u201cThese steps will be taken in light of India\u2019s importance as our third-largest export destination in 2018 for palm oil and palm-based products worth 6.84 billion ringgit ($1.63 billion),\u201d Teresa Kok, the Malaysian minister in charge of the palm oil portfolio, said in a statement.\n\nIndia is one of the biggest producers of sugar and buffalo meat in the world.\n\nReuters reported last week that India was considering restricting imports of some products from Malaysia, including palm oil, after Kuala Lumpur criticised New Delhi for its actions in Kashmir.\n\nIndia stripped its portion of the Kashmir valley of statehood and autonomy on Aug. 5, cutting internet and phone lines and arresting thousands in an attempt to dampen dissent.\n\nKok said she was aware of the news on \u201cissues that threaten the good ties between Malaysia and India\u201d and that Malaysia was open to negotiations with New Delhi on narrowing the trade deficit between the two countries.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s exports to India stood at $10.8 billion in the fiscal year that ended on March 31, while imports totalled $6.4 billion.\n\nSome Indian traders said refiners had already stopped buying Malaysian palm oil for shipment in November and December, fearing New Delhi could raise import taxes or enforce other measures to curb imports from the Southeast Asian country.\n\nTwitter users in India and Malaysia have already sparred with each other - a #BoycottMalaysia call recently trended on social media in India - after Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said at the U.N. general assembly last month that India had \u201cinvaded and occupied\u201d Kashmir, a disputed Muslim-majority region also claimed by Pakistan.\n\nIndia\u2019s foreign ministry rebuked the Malaysian government after that, asking it to \u201cbear in mind the friendly relations between the two countries and desist from making such comments\u201d.\n\n($1 = 4.1890 ringgit)", "description": "Malaysia said on Tuesday it would look to increase imports of crude sugar and buffalo meat from India, after reports that New Delhi was considering restricting imports of palm oil from Malaysia following its criticism of its actions in Kashmir.", "authors": ["A.
