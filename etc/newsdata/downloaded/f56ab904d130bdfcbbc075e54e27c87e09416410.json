Pick, tear and toss in the basil leaves (reserving the smaller ones for garnish), then leave aside to macerate for a few minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, place a large non-stick frying pan on a high heat. Drain the beans and put into the hot pan with the fennel seeds and a pinch of black pepper. Leave for 5 minutes, shaking occasionally \u2014 you want them to char and pop open, bursting their skins. Pour the macerated tomatoes into the pan with 100ml of water, season, then leave to bubble away vigorously for 1 minute. Crack in an egg on each side, then cover with a lid, plate or tin foil, reduce to a medium-low heat and slow-cook for 3 to 4 minutes for nice soft eggs, or longer if you prefer. Meanwhile, toast the bread.\n\nDivide the ricotta and spread over the two pieces of hot toast, then serve on the side of the baked eggs in beans. Sprinkle the reserved baby basil leaves over the top and tuck right in. Nice finished with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar and/or a drizzle of hot chili sauce. Delicious.\n\nYield: Makes 2 servings\n\nNo matter how busy you are, you'll find that healthy eating \u2018the Jamie way\u2019 is both simple and achievable, making it super-easy to choose exactly the kind of meals that suit you.\n\nEveryday Super Food by Jamie Oliver is published by Penguin Random House \u24d2 Jamie Oliver Enterprises Limited (2015 Everyday Super Food) Photographer: Jamie Oliver.
