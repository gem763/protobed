(Image: Disney)\n\nEvery so often, you come across a cult classic that you\u2019ve somehow never heard of, despite the fact that it\u2019s so exactly your specific brand of weird. Take, for example, Shelley Duvall\u2019s Mother Goose Rock \u2018n\u2019 Rhyme, the candy-coloured, existential fever dream of a Disney Channel musical from 1990.\n\nLike a lot of the Disney Channel\u2019s early movies, Rock \u2018n\u2019 Rhyme doesn\u2019t exactly air with any regularity and exists mostly in the minds of people who happened to catch an original broadcast and folks who got their hands on one of the few VHS copies and subsequently uploaded it online.\n\nThe movie\u2019s the kind of trippy, improbable kind of production that you almost can\u2019t believe ever actually existed, if only for the sheer number of celebrities it brought together to tell a ridiculous story about finding one\u2019s self in a world that makes no sense.\n\nSet in the world of Rhymeland, Rock \u2018n\u2019 Rhyme tells the story of Gordon Goose (Dan Gilroy), the curmudgeonly son of Mother Goose (Jean Stapleton), the seeming matriarch of an entire magical world where nursery rhymes are living people whose personalities are defined by the songs we sing about them. Unlike most of the world\u2019s \u201cRhymies,\u201d Gordon isn\u2019t especially prone to whimsy and he finds the constant mayhem that defines Rhymeland to be exhausting.\n\nRock \u2018n\u2019 Rhyme balances Gordon\u2019s dreary demeanour out by introducing Bo Peep (Shelley Duvall), a local shepherd who\u2019s lost her sheep, but is more than down to go on a madcap adventure to save the world before she gets back to looking for her flock.\n\nWhen Mother Goose suddenly goes missing, it\u2019s an immediate cause for concern, but when various Rhymies begin to disappear in the absence of her magic, Gordon and Bo Peep realise that they\u2019ve got to find her before they, too, vanish. And so they go on an adventure meeting all the residents of Rhymetown.\n\nThe movie\u2019s synopsis alone is fairly straightforward and reads like a spiritual, corporate ancestor to ABC\u2019s Once Upon a Time, but there\u2019s a very specific way that Rock \u2018n\u2019 Rhyme exists just outside of the realm of your typical reimagining of fairy tales aimed at a younger audience.\n\nTo put it simply, the movie\u2019s just really, really weird in that classic Pee-wee\u2019s Playhouse sense that always leaves you feeling as if something is deeply demented about what you\u2019re watching (wait until you see Howie Mandel as Humpty Dumpty). But at the same time, you\u2019re having fun\u2014and some of the music is pretty damned good.\n\nAs Gordon and Bo Peep journey through Rhymeland, they cross paths with Rhymies you\u2019d expect to meet, like the Itsy Bitsy Spider \u2014 played by Broadway extraordinaire Ben Vereen, who interprets the character as something like a cross between Will.i.am and Miss Piggy \u2014 and Mary, Mary Quite Contrary performed by Married With Children\u2019s Katey Sagal.\n\nHaving to ask a pathological contrarian for information to find someone is obviously a less than ideal situation, but Bo Peep keenly points out that Mary, Mary definitely knows where Little Miss Muffet (Pia Zadora) is because she\u2019s always been jealous of her, and that\u2019s the just kind of stuff jealous people know.\n\nBen Vereen as the Itsy Bitsy Spider. (Image: Disney)\n\nIt\u2019s in a moment like that when Rock \u2018n\u2019 Rhyme reveals itself to be way more wickedly funny than it initially lets on, and the humour\u2019s only heightened by the revolving door of celebrities making appearances in roles you just wouldn\u2019t expect to see them playing.\n\nCyndi Lauper doesn\u2019t make sense as the other Mary who\u2019s grown to resent her lamb, Lou (Woody Harrelson), who\u2019s spent his entire life following her around and crowding her space. And yet, she totally does in the weird way that you really could only ever hope to appreciate by watching the film as an adult.\n\nThere are moments that feel rather on the nose, like when Little Richard as Old King Cole threatens to torture people until they\u2019re squealing with happiness and laughter, but then are actual moments of something like profundity. Like when Bo Peep and Gordon realise where Mother Goose has gone off to.\n\nIn its final third of so, Rock \u2018n\u2019 Rhyme shifts into an oddly meta space where the Rhymies reckon with the fact that they\u2019re fictional beings who only exist in the stories that \u201creal\u201d people entertain themselves by reading. But that reality isn\u2019t really a crisis for the Rhymies, and the movie doesn\u2019t try to frame it as such.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s a plot device that the movie subtly uses to make a statement about what happens with small groups of people try to take ownership of stories that belong to everyone.\n\nBut just as Rock \u2018n\u2019 Rhyme starts to get heady, it falls right back down to Earth accompanied by its excellent soundtrack \u2014 Paul Simon, the Stray Cats, and Bobby Brown all perform, not to mention additional appearances by Debbie Harry and ZZ Top.\n\nThe movie brings you more or less right back to square one, albeit with everyone having a slightly brighter outlook on things. As campy cult classics go, Shelley Duvall\u2019s Mother Goose Rock \u2018n\u2019 Rhyme holds its own because it knows precisely what kind of story it wants to be.\n\nFor all of its wildness, it\u2019s tight and to the point, and like Bo Peep, it makes its message clear in a rather roundabout way: Just go with the flow and everything\u2019ll work out in the end.\n\nProbably.", "description": "Every so often, you come across a cult classic that you\u2019ve somehow never heard of, despite the fact that it\u2019s so exactly your specific brand of weird.
