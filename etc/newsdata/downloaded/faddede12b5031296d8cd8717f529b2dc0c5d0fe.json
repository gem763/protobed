(Image: Google)\n\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) has a new Chromebook. The Pixelbook Go, which was revealed during the company's Made by Google event in New York on Tuesday, is a 13.3-inch Chromebook powered by Google's Chrome OS.\n\nStarting at $649, the Pixelbook Go is designed to be an always-connected replacement for traditional Windows-powered laptops. For users looking for something to get online to browse the internet, stream videos, and get their work done, Chromebooks are a solid choice.\n\nThe Pixelbook Go, with its unique design \u2014 it's got a ribbed bottom panel \u2014 has the making of a fantastic Chromebook.\n\nDesign\n\nThe 13.3-inch Pixelbook Go's most striking feature is its ribbed bottom panel. Designed to ensure the Go stays in place whether on your lap or on your desk, the textured material certainly looks odd at first sight.\n\nThe rest of the Pixelbook Go hews closely to Google's industrial design aesthetic and features flat, muted colors. The Pixelbook Go's keyboard, naturally, features a dedicated Google Assistant key that gives you access to the company's smart assistant.\n\nInside, the Pixelbook Go is available with an Intel m3, Core i5, or Core i7 processor. There's also your choice of 8GB or 16GB of RAM, and as much as 256GB of storage. You'll also have a choice of a full-HD or 4K resolution display.\n\nThe PixelBook Go has a 15% larger battery than the standard Pixelbook, and the keys on the keyboard have been tuned to be quieter, resulting in what Google calls its ultra-quiet Hush Keys.\n\nThe PixelBook Go is designed for people who need to grab their laptop and run, so Google made the Go using lightweight magnesium. (You\u2019ll find the same material used in many other lightweight laptops including Microsoft\u2019s Surface.) The Go will be available in Just Black and Not Pink, and is available for pre-order now.\n\nPixel Buds\n\nLike Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, and seemingly every other hardware company on earth, Google also announced its latest version of its Pixel Buds at its New York event. The Buds are truly wireless earbuds that allow you to call up your Google Assistant by saying \u201cHey, Google,\u201d and then start using it right away. A built-in long-range bluetooth connection lets you connect up to three rooms away inside, and outside they\u2019ll work across the length of a football field.\n\nThe Pixel Buds are the follow up to the original Pixel Buds, and are Google's first truly wireless earbuds. (Image: Google) More\n\nLike the original, the Pixel Buds have a circular design that can last five hours on a charge and 24 hours with the charging case. Google says the Buds seal your ear for rich base and clear highs, and a special vent in the side lets in some outside environmental audio, so you don\u2019t have that kind of muted sensation. The Bud\u2019s volume also dynamically adjusts as you move from quiet areas like inside your home to louder areas like subways. Beam forming microphones are also coming.\n\nUnfortunately, Google is holding off on launching the Buds for now. The headset won\u2019t launch until Spring 2020 and will cost $179. That matches up with Apple\u2019s AirPods, which cost $159 with a standard charging case, and $199 with a wireless charging case.\n\nNest Mini\n\nIn addition to the Pixelbook Go and Pixel Buds, Google also announced its new Google Nest Mini. The speaker is the follow-up to Google\u2019s Home Mini and starts at $49. The super small speaker \u2014 it\u2019s about the size of a hockey puck \u2014 gives you access to the Google Assistant, and all of its audio functionality.", "description": "Google's Pixelbook Go and Pixel Buds are some of a slew of new hardware products the company debuted at its big event in New York.", "authors": ["Daniel Howley", "Technology Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/R6cB0WHWpPMImDO3nPgA9g--~B/aD01NjI7dz04MjQ7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/5848f6f0-ef5b-11e9-99bf-a48260026723", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
