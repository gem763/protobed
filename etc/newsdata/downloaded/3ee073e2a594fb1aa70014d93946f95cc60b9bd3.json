But before we celebrate the very best in TV this year and the trophies are handed out, it\u2019s all about the looks.\n\nThe Emmys red carpet has witnessed some major fashion moments \u2015 think Tracee Ellis Ross in hot pink Valentino Haute Couture, Sarah Paulson in an emerald green Prada dress or Viola Davis in, well, just about anything \u2015 so expect the stars dressed in their very best.\n\nEagerly awaited arrivals include the women of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d ruling over the red carpet; Billy Porter, who\u2019s promised to deliver \u201ca little \u201970s disco throwback moment\u201d; and Sandra Oh, who unfortunately won\u2019t be bringing her parents this time around.\n\nAnd if that\u2019s not enough to keep you tuning in, rest assured that the Kardashian-Jenners, who\u2019ll be presenting an award later in the evening, will have a presence, as will RuPaul, Zendaya, Gwyneth Paltrow, Taraji P. Henson and more.\n\nSee some of the best looks from the red carpet below.\n\nMandy Moore\n\nFrazer Harrison via Getty Images\n\nSterling K.
