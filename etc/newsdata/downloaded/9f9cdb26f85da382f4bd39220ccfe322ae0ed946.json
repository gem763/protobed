[Stringer/Reuters]\n\nMissing targets\n\nIn setting this year's targets, China had to consider \"maintaining stability\" as well as \"actual working conditions\" in each location, the official said in a statement, adding that there were risks the goals would not be met.\n\nOnly four of the 28 cities - Beijing, Handan, Cangzhou and Jining - met targets last winter, official data showed.\n\nPM2.5 levels in Anyang, China's most polluted city last winter, soared 13.7 percent last year. It is targeting a 6.5 percent cut this year.\n\nNearby Puyang will target a 6 percent fall this year, even though its average PM2.5 surged more than 20 percent a year ago.\n\nThe environment ministry has been at pains to say China's \"war on pollution\" would not be affected by a slowing economy, with local governments no longer judged merely on crude economic growth.\n\nBut there have already been signs of compromise, with Premier Li Keqiang saying earlier this month that China remains dependent on coal and will encourage clean and green mining.\n\nChina's coal imports are also set to rise more than 10% this year, analysts said.\n\n\"The lower air quality targets seem to reflect changed priorities,\" said Myllyvirta. \"The policymakers have let smokestack industries rebound, even if it means slowing progress on air quality.\"", "description": "Flexibility in anti-smog measures last year led to higher pollution, amid concerns weakening economy undermining resolve", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/24/6f042c7a87dc45e6be1516a90a91a0dd_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
