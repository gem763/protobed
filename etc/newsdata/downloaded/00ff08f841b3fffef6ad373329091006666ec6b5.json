(AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) More\n\nEffect on trade\n\nFor some on Wall Street, the impeachment inquiry only matters in terms of how it affects trade talks with China.\n\n\u201cIf the perception is that Trump really does have a weaker hand, then it becomes more of a photo-op agreement and less a fundamental agreement,\u201d Waddell says.\n\nInvestors are also betting on the impeachment process taking months to unfold, and that the odds of it passing a Republican-held Senate are slim.\n\nThe two prior times Congress brought impeachment proceedings against a president, market reaction was very different. Experts are quick to point out that may be because their economic backdrops were also very different.\n\n\u201cDuring the Nixon saga, stocks were already tumbling (of course, we were going into recession) and kept falling after the formal inquiry process started,\u201d Neil Dutta, Renaissance Macro Research head of economics, wrote in an email.\n\n\u201cDuring the Clinton impeachment process, markets exploded to the upside as the economy boomed,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps these political events are eventually overwhelmed by the fundamentals?\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is co-anchor of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe First Trade.\u201d Follow her on Twitter @AlexisTVNews.", "description": "You can add impeachment proceedings to the growing list of uncertainties for investors, and we all know how much the markets detest uncertainty.", "authors": ["Alexis Christoforous"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GllUkQjLiuzNGJhhj3RvZw--~B/aD0zODQwO3c9NTc2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/b6323910-d4b3-11e9-b7da-feffad528b05", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
