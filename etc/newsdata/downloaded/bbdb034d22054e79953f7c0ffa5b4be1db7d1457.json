But they still often experience \u201cinsecurity about raising children alone without help,\u201d as a team of education scholars and psychologists write in a 2018 book about single parenthood in the 21st century. Stereotypes about single parents abound, as do cultural messages about the importance of two-parent families. Events such as back-to-school nights can reinforce to single parents the message society often sends them that their parenting is insufficient or incomplete.\n\nRead: Why back-to-school season feels like the new year\u2014even for adults\n\nSuch events are almost always premised on traditional notions of child-rearing as a joint endeavor, argues Maurice Elias, a psychology professor at Rutgers University who has attended and observed many back-to-school nights over his four decades of studying social-emotional learning and student success. Schools often ask parents to attend back-to-school nights without their kids, but don\u2019t offer child-care options. This forces parents to find a way to fit the one-off occasion into their schedules\u2014and pay for child care\u2014or simply not come.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of juggling involved,\u201d Elias told me. \u201cIf you\u2019re a single parent for any reason\u2014and you could be a \u2018single parent\u2019 because your husband or wife travels for business\u2014then you have to figure out, especially if you have more than one child and the back-to-school nights aren\u2019t coordinated, What am I going to do here?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing [in schools] accommodates single parents,\u201d Sarah Netter, a freelance writer based in New Orleans who\u2019s the sole caregiver, by choice, of her first-grade adopted son, told me. \u201cThe fact of the matter is I just can\u2019t physically be in two places at once.\u201d She notes that her coordination struggles are also felt by families with two working parents.\n\n\u201cSchools aren\u2019t thinking about working parents when they schedule things,\u201d Netter says, noting that other events, such as parent-teacher conferences and bring-your-parent-to-lunch days, rest on the assumption that kids have a parent who doesn\u2019t work or who can get time off, or that parents can find and afford child care. Netter says she\u2019s almost always the only single parent in attendance at school functions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve rarely seen a satisfactory back-to-school night,\u201d Elias says, \u201cand one of the issues is that because some parents can\u2019t or won\u2019t come, we don\u2019t know what they would think of back-to-school night if they were there.\u201d\n\nA school, of course, can only do so much to ameliorate the logistical and emotional stress of being a single parent. But some tweaks to back-to-school night could help, Elias and others say\u2014such as providing free child care, allowing parents to make up a missed orientation, or substituting the one-off event with a series of regular one-on-one check-ins between teacher and parent.\n\n\u201cSo much of what the school does is catered toward stay-at-home parents,\u201d Netter says. \u201cHopefully, by attending my son\u2019s events, I can show people what single parenthood looks like.\u201d\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
