I first heard about it from Karen Feinstein, the president and chief executive of the Jewish Healthcare Foundation, who reported it at a board meeting several years ago. I wasn\u2019t surprised: Hiding common medications is a workaround, an example of circumventing onerous rules to make sure patients get even basic care.\n\nWorkarounds are legion in the American health care system, to the extent that ECRI (formerly the Emergency Care Research Institute) listed them fourth among its list of top 10 patient safety concerns for health care organizations in 2018. Workarounds, the group writes, are an adaptive response \u2014 or perhaps one should say maladaptive response \u2014 to \u201ca real or perceived barrier or system flaw.\u201d\n\nStaff use workarounds because they save valuable time. According to Anita Tucker, a business professor at Boston University, system breakdowns, or what she calls \u201coperational failures,\u201d and the workarounds they stimulate, can \u201cconsume up to 10 percent of a nurse\u2019s day.\u201d Most hospital nurses are stretched to their limits during their 12-hour shifts. No nurse has 90 minutes to lose to a slow pharmacy or an inefficient hospital bureaucracy.\n\nI saw the common sense that can underlie workarounds when my hospital floor instituted bar code scanning for medication administration. Using a hand-held scanner to register bar codes on medications and patients\u2019 hospital bracelets sounds smart. But then some medications routinely came without bar codes, or had the wrong bar codes, and we nurses weren\u2019t given an easy way to report those errors. Patients\u2019 wrist bands could be difficult to scan and the process disturbed them, especially if they were asleep. The lists of medications on the computer screen were also surprisingly hard to read, which slowed everything down.", "description": "From Obamacare to nurses stockpiling medicine, health care has become a jury-rigged mess.", "authors": ["Theresa Brown"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/05/opinion/05brown-illo/05brown-illo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
