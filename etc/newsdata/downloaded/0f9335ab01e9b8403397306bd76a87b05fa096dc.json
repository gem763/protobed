And I will wait to see what legislation the opposition may try to bring forward.\u201d\n\nThe chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster hit back at pro-EU MPs, who he accused of being in \u201cdenial of democracy\u201d.\n\nThe comments drew a ferocious backlash, with opposition MPs left shaken by the idea the prime minister could simply refuse to obey legislation compelling him to seek an extension to the 31 October Brexit deadline.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: \u201cFor ministers not to confirm that this government will accept and comply with legislation lawfully passed is breathtaking.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister must make a statement on this straightaway. No government is above the law.\u201d\n\nHis shadow cabinet colleague, John McDonnell, said it was \u201ca startling move beyond anything we\u2019ve ever seen\u2019.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u201cThe Johnson government is becoming an elective dictatorship.\u200b\u201d\n\nSNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: \u201cWe now have a UK government that can\u2019t/won\u2019t say a simple \u2018yes\u2019 to the question: will you abide by the law?\n\n\u201cNot so much prorogue as just plain rogue.\u201d\n\nTory MP Guto Bebb, a former minister, said Mr Gove\u2019s comments were \u2018a disgrace to our democracy\u2019\n\nBut Downing Street doubled down on Mr Gove\u2019s claims, with a source saying: \u201cWe will look at how we respond to legislation if and when it is successful.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister has turned up the heat on rebellious ex-ministers, urging Tory MPs to back him or see Jeremy Corbyn \u201cplunge the country into chaos\u201d.\n\nOn Sunday, he summoned Tory whips to Chequers to hammer out tactics for the week, where they discussed sacking any MP who voted with the rebel alliance.\n\nPlanned talks with some 15 rebels, including Philip Hammond and David Gauke, were scrapped on Sunday night by the chief whip due to diary issues, prompting anger from the Tory MPs.\n\nA source close to the group said: \u201cAside from being deeply discourteous, todays behaviour shows this is not a government interested in compromise. These MPs want proof that there is a genuine and sincere attempt to get a deal. The fact that the prime minister isn\u2019t even prepared to meet them suggests there isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMr Gauke, one of the leading rebels, told Sky News \u201cthe national interest has to come first\u201d, in a sign he was preparing to defy the government.\n\nA source close to the rebels described threats of deselection as \u201csheer hypocrisy\u201d, and pointed to the fact that several cabinet ministers have defied the whip on Brexit this year, including the prime minister.\n\n\u201cThis is about the national interest, and we have moved beyond the point that threats or gongs will persuade people they should abandon their principles,\u201d the source told The Independent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frankly pretty late to try and start a whipping operation now.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister insists rebellious MPs are scuppering his chances of securing a fresh agreement with Brussels, as he claimed there were \u201csigns of progress\u201d with Brussels following his meetings with European leaders in recent weeks.\n\nBut Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s Brexit chief, poured cold water on the prime minister\u2019s claims, saying he was \u201cnot optimistic\u201d over avoiding a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cOn the EU side, we had intense discussions with EU member states on the need to guarantee the integrity of the EU\u2019s single market, while keeping that border fully open,\u201d he wrote in The Daily Telegraph.\n\n\u201cIn this sense, the backstop is the maximum amount of flexibility that the EU can offer to a non-member state.\u201d\n\nHis refusal to shift on the Irish border backstop casts doubt on the prospect of a new Brexit deal, as the prime minister has described the mechanism as \u201canti-democratic\u201d and ruled out its inclusion in any agreement.\n\nOn Monday, Mr Corbyn will set out his intentions to work across party lines to thwart a no-deal Brexit.\n\nMr Corbyn is expected to say: \u201cWe are working with other parties to do everything necessary to pull our country back from the brink.\n\n\u201cLike all progressive change, democracy was won from below \u2013 it wasn\u2019t handed down from above.\n\n\u201cSo when a prime minister who hasn\u2019t won an election and who doesn\u2019t have a majority decrees that parliament will be shut down because he knows his plan for a disastrous no deal doesn\u2019t have the votes, we say that is an attack on democracy which will be resisted.\u201d", "description": "A senior cabinet minister has suggested Boris Johnson could defy legislation to prevent a no-deal Brexit if it is forced through parliament by rebel MPs.
