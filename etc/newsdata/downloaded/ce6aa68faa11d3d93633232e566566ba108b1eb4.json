Got it a month ago and just got it out.\n\nI Love it, It tracked well and was easy to get in and out of. I am a big guy 6ft 250 and with my gear I am at the max. It handled me just fine no issue.\n\nI did upgrade to the lifetime angler Kayak paddle.\n\nI also upgrade to the Cascade Mountaintech stadium seat and then added a pad. My seat is very comfortable.\n\nI made a mod to make the hatches more usable and had not seen it done before.\n\nI put Pad Eyes under the hatch and riveted it from the top. I added a bungee. see included pictures.\n\nAlso, Just saw the Lifetime 11' 6\" Yukon Kayak. Now I have kayak envy. Maybe next year.", "description": "Free 2-day shipping.
