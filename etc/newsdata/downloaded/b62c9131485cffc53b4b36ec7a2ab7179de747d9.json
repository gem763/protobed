In some cases the properties were solely rented for holding a party.\n\nFully furnished houses stripped of contents and fixtures by \u201ctenants\u201d who hired vans and used the tenancy period to remove contents have also been exempted from cover.\n\nMs Kable urged hosts to check strata rules, tenancy agreements and local council business laws to check they do not prohibit short-stay holiday rules.\n\nATO data matching action\n\nLandlords also faced extra attention from tax authorities, which are analysing detailed information of 190,000 clients provided by rental platforms.\n\nTax Office officials said the first round of letters will be sent to house and apartment owners during the next few weeks asking them to review their return and the income they earned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBooming short-term rentals are, according to research group IbisWorld, providing cheap and convenient accommodation, intensifying pressure on hotels, motels and caravan parks.\n\nAirbnb and other online accommodation specialists are obeying the Tax Office\u2019s request to provide financial details of about 190,000 users that have received income from the platform, according to tax specialists.\n\nIn addition to tracking income, the ATO will be looking to ensure deductions are only made for periods when the property is rented out, or is genuinely available for rent.\n\n\"It is important to note that this targets all accommodation sharing platforms, not a single platform,\" a tax spokesperson said.\n\n\"Information from online platform sharing sites for around 190,000 Australians will be examined to identify taxpayers who have left out rental income and over-claimed deductions.\n\n\"Where the data shows people have left out income from their return we will write to them asking that they review their return and the income they earnt from these platforms. Some clients will start to receive these letters in the next few weeks.\"\n\nH &R Block director of tax communications Mark Chapman said authorities are receiving data from other rental sites so they know \u201cwhich sites are rented, when they are rented and who the owners are\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey also have public access to websites, just as everyone else does, and get details of property sales from state land registries, which are also used for data-matching,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than two million individuals reported rental income of $42 billion during 2016, according to the ATO.\n\nState governments, including NSW, are also considering a register of holiday lets to keep track of the industry and protect investors from having their properties sub-leased by tenants.", "description": "Insurers have warned 140,000 property owners planning short-term rentals this summer that their home and contents insurance was unlikely to cover \u201cpotentially catastrophic\u201d losses.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_81/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f58888f4cb9e946645b320c48e70046fc2e198fc", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
