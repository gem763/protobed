As loads of sales-boosting events \u2014 Halloween, Thanksgiving, Cyber Monday, Black Friday and Christmas \u2014 fall in this quartile, the sector generally sees a sales boost.\n\nDeloitte expects sales to increase between 4.5% and 5% from a year ago. E-commerce sales are expected to surge 14-18% year over year compared with sales rise of 11.2% in 2018. Low levels of unemployment coupled with sustained monthly job creation might encourage consumers to spend more during the holiday season.\n\nChances of a Fed Rate Cut: The Fed may cut rates at the Oct 29-30 meeting. In the past week, a 50-50 chance of a Fed rate cut almost went up to pricing in a move almost entirely. Such low rates should boost the broader market on cues of continued supply of cheap money.
