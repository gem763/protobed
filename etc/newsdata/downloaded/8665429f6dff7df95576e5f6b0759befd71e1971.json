The figures follow a string of lackluster manufacturing data around the world that contributed to a wild August for financial markets.\n\nMany investors have been preoccupied with the prospect of a recession, in part because of worries about global growth. Those fears also weighed on commodities Tuesday, sending prices for crude oil and copper lower.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average lost as much as 425 points before paring some of its declines to end down 285.26 points, or 1.1% to 26118.02. The S&P 500 dropped 20.19 points, or 0.7%, to 2906.27. The Nasdaq Composite fell 88.72 points, or 1.1% to 7874.16.\n\nShares of industrials giants were some of the biggest losers in the S&P 500. Bellwether stocks such as Caterpillar dropped $1.97, or 1.7%, to $117.03. Boeing lost $9.67, or 2.7%, to $354.42. Shares of 3M shed $3.08, or 1.9%, to $158.64, underperforming the broader market.\n\n\"Manufacturing is probably the area that seems most uncertain,\" said Stephen Lee, founding principal at Logan Capital Management, adding that the U.S. is in \"slow growth mode.\"\n\nInvestors flocked to government bonds and gold -- assets considered relatively safer -- as they fled riskier bets such as stocks. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 1.469% Tuesday, from 1.503% Friday. Yields fall as bond prices rise. Gold prices settled at the highest level since April 2013.\n\nThe selling in stocks also came after Beijing said it had lodged a complaint with the World Trade Organization over U.S. tariffs. On Sunday, the U.S. imposed fresh tariffs on Chinese goods including clothing, tools and electronics as retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. soybeans, crude oil and pharmaceuticals also took effect.\n\nMeanwhile, Japan on Monday said its manufacturers cut spending during the second quarter for the first time in two years, adding to a series of recent data suggesting the U.S.-China trade fight was damping the world economy.\n\n\"It's going to take more time than what people think,\" said Arun Daniel, a senior portfolio manager at J O Hambro Capital Management, of the U.S. and China trade conflict. \"We expect there will be continued volatility in the market over the next 30 to 60 days.\"\n\nLater this week, investors will be parsing fresh economic data, including the latest U.S. jobs figures Friday, to measure the impact of the trade conflict and health of the domestic economy.\n\nStocks around the world also fell. The Stoxx Europe 600 slipped 0.2%, with Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 falling at least 0.3%.\n\nThe declines came after a mixed session in Asia, in which indexes in mainland China gained while Japanese stocks were flat and Korea's Kospi edged down.\n\nThe Chinese yuan fell to its lowest level in more than a decade in offshore trading, as it neared 7.2 against the U.S. dollar. In August, it passed the psychologically significant level of more than seven to the dollar, aggravating Washington, which accused China of currency manipulation.\n\nMeanwhile, the British pound hit its lowest level against the dollar in 34 years after Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned lawmakers not to thwart his plans for quitting the European Union with or without a deal on Oct. 31.\n\nKallum Pickering, senior economist at German investment bank Berenberg, said an election would increase chances of a pact between Mr. Johnson's Conservative party and the Brexit party on a no-deal exit from the European Union.\n\n\"This would increase the risk of a hard Brexit. Whereas if Mr. Johnson doesn't face a general election but can keep the chance of a no deal alive until October then there might be a compromise with the EU or a fresh extension,\" he said.\n\nSterling fell against both the dollar and the euro, touching $1.1969 and EUR1.0950. Before the 2016 referendum, a pound bought $1.4687.\n\nMr. Johnson told his cabinet that he would call a general election for Oct. 14 if Parliament seeks to block his agenda on Brexit. The pound is likely to face further volatility as lawmakers return from summer vacation and aim to pass fresh legislation.\n\nThe yield on U.K. 10-year gilts fell to 0.341% before recovering to 0.362%, and the yield on German 10-year bunds approached record lows at minus-0.725%.\n\nWrite to Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.com and Anna Isaac at anna.isaac@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 03, 2019 16:41 ET (20:41 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
