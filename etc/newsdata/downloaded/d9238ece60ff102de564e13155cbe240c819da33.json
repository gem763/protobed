(Lucas Jackson/Reuters)\n\nGod doesn\u2019t necessarily want you to own an AR-15, but there is a natural right to self-defense.\n\nThe fastest way to trend on Twitter, and not in a good way, is to say that the right to bear arms is a God-given right.\n\nTexas state representative Matt Schaefer established this beyond a doubt in a Twitter thread in the aftermath of the West Texas shooting spree. He said that he wouldn\u2019t use \u201cthe evil acts of a handful of people to diminish the God-given rights of my fellow Texans.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProgressives were aghast, and when actress Alyssa Milano objected, Texas U.S. senator Ted Cruz jumped in to support Schaefer\u2019s argument (in less bombastic terms).\n\nThe basic proposition isn\u2019t hard to defend, and indeed it is written into our fundamental documents. This doesn\u2019t mean that God wants you to own an AR-15, or that every jot and tittle of our current gun regime is divinely mandated. Far from it. Yet there is a natural right to self-defense, and gun ownership is inherently connected to that right in a modern society.\n\nThis is glossed over even by Democrats who have a connection to America\u2019s culture of gun ownership. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar said the other day, \u201cI look at [gun legislation] and I always say, \u2018Does this hurt Uncle Dick in his deer stand?\u2019\u201d That\u2019s not the question, though. The Second Amendment isn\u2019t fundamentally about Uncle Dick bagging deer, but about his ability to defend himself and his family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe notion of God-given rights shouldn\u2019t be controversial. It is a bedrock of the American creed, written into the Declaration of Independence. Its preamble says, of course, that all men \u201care endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bill of Rights numbers \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear Arms\u201d among those unalienable rights. Why? Because the founders believed that everyone has an inherent right to self-defense.\n\nAs David Harsanyi notes in his history of the gun in America, First Freedom, John Adams said in his defense of one of the British soldiers charged in the Boston Massacre in 1770 that self-defense was \u201cthe primary canon in the law of nature.\u201d\n\nOwning a gun is an extension of this law of nature, and has been recognized as such for a long time in Anglo-America. The right to bear arms had deep roots in England, and it predated the Constitution on these shores. Pennsylvania guaranteed the right early on. In his draft of the Virginia Constitution in 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote, \u201cNo freeman shall ever be debarred the use of arms.\u201d (His language wasn\u2019t adopted.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is out of this historical soil that we got the Second Amendment. Guns would make it possible for Americans to defend themselves, and to defend their liberties. Alexander Hamilton wrote in The Federalist of \u201cthe original right of self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government.\u201d This right can be used if necessary, per Hamilton, \u201cagainst the usurpations of the national rulers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was no doubt at the time about the importance of the right to bear arms. Harsanyi writes that \u201cnot a single soul in the provisional government or at the Second Continental Congress or any delegate at the Constitutional Convention \u2014 or, for that matter, any new American \u2014 ever argued against the idea of individuals owning a firearm.\u201d\n\nIt was only later that the Second Amendment came to be considered an inkblot, before its true meaning was excavated again.\n\nNone of this is necessarily a trump card in the gun-control debate \u2014 the most commonly proposed gun-control restrictions wouldn\u2019t substantially lessen gun ownership. It does mean, though, that there is a limit to how far gun control can go in America and that proponents of new restrictions should be fully aware that they are tampering with a constitutionally protected individual right. The Second Amendment doesn\u2019t have lesser status than the First.\n\nIf Uncle Dick likes to hunt, good for him. But his right to own a firearm doesn\u2019t begin or end there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00a9 2019 by King Features Syndicate", "description": "There is a limit to how far gun control can go in America, and proponents of new restrictions should be fully aware that they are tampering with a constitutionally protected individual right.", "authors": ["Rich Lowry", "Jack Crowe", "Kyle Smith", "Neil Gorsuch", "Matthew Continetti", "John Mccormack", "Nicholas Phillips", "Read More", "The American Conservative", "The Week"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gun-beretta-nra-show.jpg?fit=1200%2C700&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
