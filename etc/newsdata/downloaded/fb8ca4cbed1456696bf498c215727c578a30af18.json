OLI SCARFF/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson took an enormous gamble on Tuesday after making good on threats he would seek a general election -- after firing 21 members of his own party.\n\nRebels in Johnson's Conservative Party had been forewarned that voting against the government on Tuesday would result in their being thrown out of the parliamentary party and barred from standing as a Conservative at any future election.\n\nBut the unprecedented move to sack 21 Conservatives, many of them long-serving members, was a stark sign of just how high the stakes have been ratcheted up. Some observers suggest it could even amount to a reshaping of the party itself.\n\nIn carrying out the cull, Johnson blew apart his majority, presumably with the idea of replacing those members in a general election with others who will toe that line.\n\nBy seeking a snap election, he could in fact be aiming to increase his majority and strengthen his hand on Brexit all at the same time. That said, his predecessor Theresa May tried the same tactic in 2017 -- and it spectacularly blew up in her face.\n\nAnd it looks unlikely that he'll be granted early elections by Parliament, which must agree to them by two-thirds majority, unless no-deal Brexit is ruled out first.", "description": "A \"rebel alliance\" of UK lawmakers opposed to a no-deal Brexit will seize control of the parliamentary agenda on Wednesday.
