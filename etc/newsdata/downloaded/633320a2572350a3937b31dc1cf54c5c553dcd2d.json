From there it last until the end of his shift nine hours later and up until the pursuit. They could not comment why the vehicle was only partially charged\n\nThe spokesperson said there was no written policy regarding gas or charging vehicles but general guidelines state they need to be at least half full at the beginning of a shift.\n\nThey told DailyMail.com: 'This one instance does not in any way change our feeling regarding the performance of the vehicle for patrol purposes.\n\n'So far the car is meeting or exceeding our expectations. We are still in our first 6 months of the pilot program and we\u2019re keeping track of all the data.'\n\nThe Tesla is able to drive up to 265 miles on one charge, Fremont police told the Sacramento Bee. The force are aiming to cut their greenhouse emissions to 25 per cent of the 2005 levels.", "description": "Fremont officer Jesse Hartman was chasing a 'felony vehicle' wanted in connection with a crime in Santa Clara, California, when he noticed his vehicle had low battery.", "authors": ["Josh Saunders For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/26/00/18941038-0-image-a-17_1569453452340.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
