But Haacke went for the jugular, merely following the money to devastating effect. His systemic view of the museum\u2019s role in the capitalist food chain is stunningly damning. The classic \u201cOn Social Grease\u201d (1975) consists of six magnesium plaques suitable for a corporate lobby. Inviting the viewer to connect the dots, Haacke juxtaposed quotes from industry and museum leaders to highlight the rhetoric melding funding of the arts with good business practice. Here, for example, is a good one from Robert Kingsley of Exxon: \u201cExxon\u2019s support of the arts serves the arts as a social lubricant. And if business is to continue in big cities, it needs a more lubricated environment.\u201d Haacke\u2019s \u201cMetroMobiltan\u201d (1985) deploys museum-style signage to juxtapose images of violence in South Africa with a Mobil-sponsored art exhibition in New York City, pointing up Mobil\u2019s ties to the apartheid government as well as to the Met. One panel quotes a Met pamphlet pitching \u201cmany PR opportunities\u201d custom-crafted for sponsors in the bland pseudo-neutrality of museum-speak: \u201cThese can often provide a creative and cost-effective answer to specific marketing objectives, particularly where international, government, or consumer relations may be a fundamental concern.\u201d\n\nMuseums\u2019 chumminess with industry got a boost from the \u201cculture wars\u201d of the late \u201980s, when art battled censorship by wingnuts who then took aim at the NEA. Homophobic Jesse Helms was triggered by Robert Mapplethorpe. Rudy Giuliani was pissed off by Andres Serrano\u2019s \u201cPiss Christ\u201d and Chris Ofili\u2019s turd-embellished portrait of the Madonna (recently donated to MoMA by trustee Steve Cohen). Contending with the NEA cuts, museums turned to corporate sponsors for a bailout, Haacke explains in the essay \u201cMuseums, Managers of Consciousness.\u201d Philip Morris donated to Helms (an ultraconservative senator from North Carolina), and gave even more to vulnerable arts organizations, resulting in such cozy arrangements as a branch of the Whitney inside the corporate headquarters of Philip Morris.\n\n\u201cPractically all institutions have accepted the domination of the public sphere by corporate interests,\u201d Haacke observed in 2004. \u201cMany of them without offering much resistance and without embarrassment.\u201d For decades, museums have colluded to soften the public image of toxic funders, to disconnect the vicious sources of their wealth from its salubrious potency to fund art (even though such funding is almost always underwritten at taxpayer expense). Haacke\u2019s powerful oeuvre reconnects those dots. Shrewdly leading with identity, the DTP coalition acted on Haacke\u2019s systemic critique, wielding the woke museum as a PR tool to target Kanders\u2019s reputation rather than launder it. And thus the coalition attached a human face to the violence of an exploitative, immoral economic system that profits by immiserating the very identity groups the museum is taking such pains to celebrate. Unfortunately, as outside protesters, they had zero leverage with the Whitney.\n\nFollowing the money is important and tricky. The rot of predatory capitalism must be solved first and foremost by economic justice. That museums must diversify collections and staff is self-evident, yet to focus only on diversifying them\u2014without dismantling structures of funding and reward, in efforts financed by predatory capitalists who continue to profit from exploitation\u2014allows business to go on as usual, now with woke optics. What if elite identitarian groupthink has it backward? Racial discourse has been used to justify exploitation for centuries. Yet attempts to avoid racism have a treacherous way of instantiating racist frameworks and ways of thinking. Why is the notion of working toward racial equality so often presented as an \u201calternative to an egalitarian program of redistribution,\u201d as Adolph Reed Jr. puts it, rather than part of the same project? Perhaps because separating these concerns helps the overlords keep the status quo essentially in place.\n\nIn the art world, curating by identity has been embraced as a gesture to rectify historic injustices. The importance of including historically overlooked groups can\u2019t be overstated, but for artists, the emphasis on identity has a downside. People now focus on demographic attributes\u2014and market value\u2014more avidly than the work itself. Rooted in history and a web of social relations\u2014including the central fact of how the business of art is funded\u2014art is also a realm of invention, transformation, play, magisterial thing-ness. Identity, the current lingua franca of art marketing, is integral to some artists\u2019 practice, but it is not the main driver of the work of many others. Elena Crippa, curator of the recent Frank Bowling exhibition at the Tate, said that the Guyana-born British artist \u201crejected being categorized or pinned down as being either a black artist belonging to the Windrush generation or anything else.\u201d Bowling wanted the show to focus purely on the formal aspects of his work rather than his life story and his race. \u201cI don\u2019t know what black and Asian art is,\u201d he commented. \u201cI know what art is art.\u201d\n\nBowling\u2019s wish for his work to be taken on its own terms\u2014not reduced to tribal affiliation\u2014used to be shared by many artists. Today, artists are professionalized to package their identity as part of their brand\u2014whether they do it themselves, or it is done to them, sometimes to the artist\u2019s dismay. The push to see art through the prism of identity says more about our current political climate\u2014and institutional pressures\u2014than it reveals about art, and many artists.\n\nThis year\u2019s Whitney Biennial, which became a lightning rod for anti-Kanders activism, was conspicuously diverse in both the gender and ethnicity of its participants, an overachievement that the curators hailed as a breakthrough effort to reflect \u201ca snapshot of art in the United States\u201d (and perhaps unwittingly, ageism\u2014most of the 75 artists were under age 40, 20 of them younger than 33). Reviewers took the census: \u201cMore than half of the artists were women\u201d; \u201cfour identify themselves as gender non-conforming\u201d; and \u201cmore than half belong to racial or ethnic minorities,\u201d including eight \u201cidentifying as Native American.\u201d At the opening, a veteran artist channeled the curators: \u201cThey\u2019re on an Easter egg hunt,\u201d she chuckled. \u201cOh look, I found one of these, one of those\u2014look, a purple one!\u201d She noted only three artists born before 1960 who weren\u2019t dead. (\u201cI\u2019m going to put in my will, \u2018Don\u2019t include me when I\u2019m dead!\u2019\u201d she told me. \u201cIf they don\u2019t give me a show before then....\u201d) The show fetishized the young discoveries along with a handful of overlooked olds, sprinkling in a few stars to validate everyone else.\n\nNot many artists\u2014even in \u201cfreedom\u2019s land\u201d\u2014 have the appetite, the chutzpah, or the clout to risk ruffling patrons\u2019 feathers. In a self-obsessed culture, identity politics suit institutional diversity goals\u2014and flatter the woke global elite\u2014while systemic critiques of capitalism (and its gentrification, awkward!) are effectively marginalized. (The notable exception is Haacke, who remained influential, though banned from U.S. museums for many years after a notorious incident at the Guggenheim, where he documented the holdings of a slumlord whose ties with the Gugg remain unclear. The show, in any case, was canceled. Edward Fry, the curator who defended Haacke, was also effectively canceled, never again to work in a U.S. museum.)\n\nOf course, there are always those who are fine with going along to get along. The higher up people are in any organization, the more socialized they are not to rock the boat. A highly placed curator I know gets positively giddy hobnobbing with rich collectors and donors; it sends a thrill up his leg! Meanwhile, the world burns. While most art world denizens deplore the patriarchy, racism, the climate crisis, Trump, etc., their curiosity usually stops short of the financial predators whence spring the obscene amounts of money sloshing around the global art market\u2014a willed ignorance that enables the grotesque transfer of yet more wealth and cultural prestige to the one percent. In such circles, the complexity of oligarchy and its Orwellian tentacles induces glazed eyes, if not learned helplessness by design.\n\nThe higher people are in any organization, the more socialized they are not to rock the boat. A highly placed curator I know gets positively giddy hobnobbing with rich collectors and donors. Meanwhile, the world burns.\n\nAs the Whitney patronized DTP\u2019s nine-week-long spectacle of dissent this spring\u2014a multiculti ruckus in the museum lobby and galleries, burning incense to purge colonial vibes, even marching to Kanders\u2019s nearby digs in the now turbo-gentrified Village, where protesters held a rally and left Kanders a \u201clarger-than-life model of a Safariland tear gas canister\u201d\u2014one might have held out some hope for claiming the museum world as a preserve of social-justice allyship. Or again, more skeptically, one could have been forgiven for thinking the increasingly woke museum is yet the newest gambit to preserve the stranglehold of the ruling elite (who continue, in the broader scheme of things, to profit from distinctly unwoke border detention centers, the militarized police, surveillance of dissidents and journalists, looting and plunder for shareholder profit, and looming ecocide). Recall Walter Benjamin: \u201cThere is no document of civilization that is not at the same time a document of barbarism.\u201d\n\nLest I be unclear: Of course arts orgs should not enable toxic donors. Philanthropy is not an adequate alibi for exploitation. Greed is not respectable and should be shamed with relish! When predators are exposed, cultural institutions should support transparency, not permit bad-doers to hide behind the museum\u2019s skirts! (And Carmela should leave Tony, if she doesn\u2019t approve of the family biz.)\n\nLike Carmela, museums are past masters at putting a respectable face on barbarism. In an increasingly woke world, it is no longer possible for them to deflect outrage. The danger comes when we allow identity politics to placate social-justice concerns without fully addressing elite impunity for an exploitative, immoral economy that also happens to be wrecking the planet. Deployed in this all-too-common and cynical fashion, identity politics are to museums what tax-deductible philanthropy is to the rich: an acceptable way to neutralize dissent and bury past and present crimes.\n\nWhat is to be done? The answers are as simple as they are hard to carry out: Institute tax reform to undo the current feudal model, redistribute the wealth the one percent has filched from the people, provide direct public funding for the arts (not funneled first through greedy plutocrats).\n\nUntil then, on the all-important battlefield of PR, Nan Goldin, Hito Steyerl, and the Whitney dropouts have shown that prominent artists are best positioned to take on toxic patrons by refusing to let them trade on their prestige. Thanks to Goldin\u2019s P.A.I.N. (as well as oodles of lawsuits and a searing New Yorker expos\u00e9), the Sacklers are worldwide pariahs\u2014whether or not their name continues to tag museums like a deluxe badge of greed. (Removing the names is a symbolic gesture, and a legal question, in many cases, negotiated by the drug-pushers for their \u201cgenerosity.\u201d) Thanks to Steyerl, the Serpentine will no longer drape Peel\u2019s creepy surveillance \u201cinvestments\u201d with respectability. Imagine if more art stars repeated Goldin\u2019s powerful gesture when she refused a retrospective at London\u2019s National Portrait Gallery unless it cut ties with the Sacklers. The museum met her demand, Goldin\u2019s career thrives, and she has set an example of artistic integrity and ethical courage that is now emboldening others.\n\nMore and more critics are coming around to Goldin\u2019s position that \u201cdirect action is our only hope.\u201d When MoMA\u2019s much-anticipated expansion opens this fall, bad-acting donors such as Fink should be tied to its tail like a rattling tin can. With this disgraceful connection firmly fixed in the public mind, no one can look upon the new woke wing of MoMA without also pondering what paid for it: odious \u201cinvestments\u201d in detention centers, those de facto prisons that target the same overlooked populations the museum\u2019s galleries now welcome.\n\nMoMA\u2019s annual Party in the Garden is a swanky fund-raiser that was picketed last year by underpaid MoMA workers, who protested \u201cModern art, ancient wages.\u201d Hoping for another action, perhaps to target prison-profiteer Fink, I showed up early this year, but alas, no demonstration. Instead, I looked out on the Midtown tourist district\u2019s canyon of luxury development and sleek corporate towers. Fifty-third Street on that glorious May evening oozed money\u2014and its lack. A few doors away from MoMA, bedded down on a concrete bench, backpack for a pillow, lay a gentleman sleeping. I lurked near the entrance, where, disgorged by their shiny town cars, the discreet and pampered VIPs sauntered in.\n\nFrom my post I eyed collector and dealer Adam Lindemann, the militantly high-end shopper who crusaded against art fair looky-loos in 2011, rabble-rousing his fellow spenders to \u201cOccupy Miami Basel\u201d\u2014a social protest every bit as perverse as its sounds. His gallerist partner, Amalia Dayan, accompanied him in pointy S&M attire: a sharp-shouldered gunmetal-gray jacket, tight skirt, and bondage heels (to stomp on the non-rich?). While the VIPs celebrated themselves at the dinner inside honoring real estate moneybags Alice and Tom Tisch, modern dance legend Yvonne Rainer, and the star architects of the $400 million new wing, my $250 tickets (courtesy of this magazine) confined me outside in the garden, with the after-partyers, a youngish \u201csocial\u201d crowd such as you might find in a Sex and the City sequel to a sequel to a sequel, the Matisse and Maillol sculptures simply party decor for the open bars and selfies. The throbbing DJ drowned out any chat\u2014or fruitful eavesdropping. It was a fund-raiser, after all: The modern masters were merely the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne for the schmoozing and mingling rich, the human (all too human) life-support system for immortal Art. Inside, beyond a phalanx of greeters, the VIPs applauded one another, protected from scrutiny.\n\nWhere would toxic philanthropists be without the arts to stave off the pitchforks? They\u2019d be simply toxic, which clarifies things. The expulsion from the Garden is a classic motif about the end of innocence. Like Adam and Eve, museums and artists now face a rude alarm bell. Will they reckon with their de facto role as toxic philanthropy\u2019s enablers? Are we on the verge of a new global awakening? Take it from Carmela\u2019s shrink: One thing you can\u2019t say is nobody told you.", "description": "The rich fund museums to launder their reputations.
