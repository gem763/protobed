For now the spotlight turned to the Fed, which is expected\n\nto cut its policy rate for a third time in a row when it\n\nconcludes its two-day meeting on Wednesday. An advance reading of economic growth data in the third\n\nquarter was also expected to be scrutinized for clues on the\n\neconomic outlook, coming ahead of other major data releases such\n\nas Friday's key non-farm payrolls report.\n\n\"In the last 4-5 weeks there has been a concern that the\n\nconsumer part of the market is starting to slow and that could\n\nmean more cuts next year,\" said Derek Halpenny, European head of\n\nglobal markets at MUFG in London.\n\n\"So what lies ahead post the Fed meeting, the GDP data,\n\npayrolls will shape market expectations in addition to what (Fed\n\nchief Jerome) Powell will say today.\"\n\nThe dollar was steady against the euro at $1.1117 and\n\nmarginally lower versus a basket of six major currencies at\n\n97.630 .\n\nAgainst the yen, the greenback was also little moved at\n\n108.86 yen , not far from its three-month high of 109.07\n\nyen touched on Tuesday.\n\nInvestors are watching for any indication that further cuts\n\nare likely, with futures pricing suggesting more easing is\n\nexpected in 2020. If that is not foreshadowed, traders expect\n\nthe dollar to rise.\n\n\"If the market is going to price in the end of current\n\nrate-cut cycle, the dollar/yen could climb above 110 yen,\" said\n\nTohru Sasaki, head of Japan markets research at JPMorgan Chase\n\nBank.\n\n\"On the other hand, if the market is going to price in two\n\nmore cuts after this month's expected cut, the pair could fall\n\nto mid-107 yen level,\" he added.\n\nRISK ASSETS\n\nOptimism that Washington and Beijing would finalise the\n\nfirst-stage of a trade deal next month had boosted risk assets\n\nin recent days, but markets have turned wary.\n\nA U.S. administration official said on Tuesday an interim\n\ntrade agreement between the United States and China might not be\n\ncompleted in time for signing on the sidelines of an\n\nAsia-Pacific summit in Chile next month, but that does not mean\n\nthe accord is falling apart. The Chinese yuan inched up marginally as investors awaited\n\nthe outcome of the Fed meeting and more clarity on how Sino-U.S.\n\ntrade negotiations are going.\n\nIn the spot market, offshore spot yuan CNH=EBS was last\n\nchanging hands at 7.0580, a touch firmer on the day.\n\nEarlier in the onshore market, the People's Bank of China\n\n(PBOC) set the midpoint rate CNY=PBOC at a two-month high of\n\n7.0582 per dollar, 35 pips firmer than Tuesday's fix.\n\nSterling meanwhile drew support from hopes that a disorderly\n\nBrexit can be avoided.\n\nBritain will hold its first December election in almost a\n\ncentury after Prime Minister Boris Johnson won approval from the\n\nHouse of Commons on Tuesday for an early ballot aimed at\n\nbreaking the deadlock over the UK leaving the European\n\nUnion The British pound was last at $1.2874 GBP=D3 , little\n\nchanged on the day and below five-month highs hit earlier this\n\nmonth. It was also steady at 86.34 pence EURGBP=D3 .\n\n\"Johnson has cross-party support and (the opposition) Labour\n\nParty has lost a fair lot of the credibility it had in the 2017\n\nelection,\" said MUFG's Halpenny.\n\n\"So that's reflected in the stability in sterling - markets\n\nbelieve the Conservative party will hold on to power and have a\n\nBrexit deal agreed with the EU.\"\n\n\n\n", "description": "REFILE-FOREX-Dollar bides time ahead of anticipated Fed rate cut", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/dollars_2_800x533_L_1411908930.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
