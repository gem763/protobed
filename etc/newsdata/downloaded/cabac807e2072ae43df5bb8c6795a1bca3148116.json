We stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight,\u201d Trump said in a Twitter thread on Monday just as US troops stationed in northeastern Syria were reportedly pulling back from their positions.\n\n....almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home. WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN. Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\nTrump claimed credit for \u201cquickly\u201d defeating the terrorist group Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) in Syria before explaining why he apparently chose to abandon Kurdish militias, who fought that battle with US air and artillery support, in their stand-off with Turkey.\n\n\u201cThe Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so. They have been fighting Turkey for decades. I held off this fight for almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTurkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out, and what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their \u2018neighborhood.\u2019 They all hate ISIS, have been enemies for years. We are 7000 miles away and will crush ISIS again if they come anywhere near us!\u201d the US president added.\n\nThe US leader also complained about US failure to take responsibility for trying and jailing its citizens, who went to Syria to join IS and were later captured by the Kurds. The US will not be a \u201csucker\u201d to Europe on any issue, Trump declared.\n\nTrump\u2019s apparent washing of hands comes as Turkey is preparing an invasion into Syria targeting Kurdish militias, whom Ankara considers a terrorist force allied with a Kurdish insurgency on Turkey\u2019s own territory. Turkey wants to establish a \u201csafety zone\u201d along the border between the two countries, arguing that as a side benefit it will allow Syrian refugees currently residing in Turkey to go back to their country.\n\nThe Syrian Kurds earlier said Washington failed to deliver on its commitment to protect them from the Turkish onslaught.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
