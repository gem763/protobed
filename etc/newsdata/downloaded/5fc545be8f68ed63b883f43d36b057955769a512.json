Former CIA Director John Brennan, Trump-Russia dossier author Christopher Steele, and former Trump adviser Carter Page\u2014who was the subject of a surveillance warrant that is now under investigation by the inspector general\u2014haven\u2019t been contacted for interviews, either.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/0d/b3/08dda1db44dc8b035fc7a44ad869/impeachment-evolution2.png\"\n\nCombined with reports that Barr has traveled with Durham internationally seeking evidence from the U.S.\u2019s closest intelligence allies, Durham\u2019s apparent lack of interest in the FBI at this point suggests that he and Barr are focusing on examining the intelligence community\u2019s role in the Russia probe\u2014and, in accordance with Trump\u2019s desires, looking at whether the help provided by U.S. allies in the Russia probe, including the U.K., Italy, Australia and Ukraine, may itself have constituted foreign interference.\n\nFormer attorney general Michael Mukasey, whose son Marc represents the Trump Organization and is a longtime confidant of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, recently speculated in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed that Durham may be trying to determine whether \u201cFederal Bureau of Investigation tried to get evidence from Ukrainian government officials against Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, to pressure him into cooperating against Mr. Trump.\u201d Mukasey also noted that, according to a recent Justice Department statement, \u201ccertain Ukrainians who are not members of the government have volunteered information to Mr. Durham, which he is evaluating.\u201d\n\nThe new revelations about Barr and Durham\u2019s work and travels also present the clearest contrast yet to the Justice Department\u2019s internal investigation into the Russia probe origins, led by the DOJ\u2019s inspector general and focused on the FBI\u2019s conduct. That probe remains ongoing.\n\n\u201cThe question Durham and Barr now seem to be asking is, \u2018How was this information fed to the bureau in 2016?\u201d said one former FBI official. \u201cThat\u2019s distinct from what the IG has been looking at, and seems to indicate that their theory now is the FBI itself was duped by the intelligence community and its overseas partners.\u201d\n\nA tweet sent out by Republican Sen. John Cornyn on Friday suggested that the inquiry is also broader than has been reported. \u201cNow, the Trump Justice Department is investigating foreign government influence, VP Biden conflicts of interest, and possible corruption,\u201d he wrote, referring to Vice President Joe Biden. But a Cornyn aide said the senator meant to say \"that the Durham investigation could end up also looking at the Bidens,\" not that it already was. The Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nIn his phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25\u2014which Trump\u2019s national security team delayed for months because they were wary of how Trump\u2019s fixation with conspiracy theories surrounding the origins of the Russia investigation would be reflected in the call, according to former officials\u2014Trump asked Zelensky to do him a \u201cfavor\u201d by looking into Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 election, and suggested he connect with Barr \u201cto get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Ukrainian officials on Friday announced a fresh review of why that probe was shut down.\n\nThe Justice Department has denied that Barr received any instructions from Trump to work with the Ukrainians on a Biden investigation. But Barr\u2019s reported personal involvement in Durham\u2019s probe suggests the attorney general has been more closely overseeing an inquiry of deep importance to the president than was previously believed.\n\nDurham, for his part, appears to have trained his focus on the intelligence community, reportedly seeking interviews with the CIA analysts who drew conclusions about Putin\u2019s motivations in 2016. Trump\u2019s allies have been fixated on the question of how the intelligence community determined that Russia intervened specifically to help Trump win rather than to just sow chaos and distrust in the Democratic process. Some accounts have suggested that the intelligence community had a human asset in Putin\u2019s inner circle, though others have indicated that the U.S. used signals intelligence to intercept conversations among Russian officials.\n\nAs POLITICO first reported, that question has already been asked and answered at the CIA\u2019s highest levels \u2014 by Mike Pompeo, a Trump loyalist. Just after Pompeo took over as CIA director in 2017, he conducted a personal review of the CIA\u2019s findings, grilling analysts on their conclusions in a challenging and at times combative interview, people familiar with the matter said. He ultimately found no evidence of any wrongdoing, or that the analysts had been under political pressure to produce their findings.\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos, another Trump campaign adviser who has repeatedly declared that the entire FBI investigation was a setup by Western intelligence services including the British, Australians, Italians and CIA, twice declined to comment when asked whether he\u2019d been interviewed by the prosecutor.\n\nPapadopoulos pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his own contacts with a Russian-linked professor named Joseph Mifsud, who told Papadopoulos in the spring of 2016 that the Russians had \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of her emails.\n\nThat disclosure, which was relayed to the FBI by an Australian diplomat who heard about it from Papadopoulos, is what the FBI has said spurred its initial counterintelligence investigation into Trump campaign associates with links to Russia. But Papadopoulos has claimed, without evidence, that Mifsud was actually a plant, sent by Western intelligence officials to entrap him and give the FBI an excuse to open an investigation.\n\nMifsud\u2019s whereabouts remain unknown. But Barr reportedly asked Trump to solicit the Australians\u2019 help in the investigation. And he and Durham recently traveled to Italy to investigate the events that led up to Mueller\u2019s probe\u2014and, as part of that, to reportedly hear a taped deposition Mifsud gave on the subject months ago.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/81/fd/3970382447fdb46dfa193dbd1281/19104-william-barr-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
