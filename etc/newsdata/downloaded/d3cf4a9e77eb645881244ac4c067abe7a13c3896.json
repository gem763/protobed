Like, pulling the ball out like this.\" Bryant says. \"I don't know when this became a thing.\n\n\"[Walker's] got the defender on his heels, standing in this tight space we can carry a threat. But now, he backs it all the way back [out to halfcourt]. It's just more work. Now the defense can collapse on you, and you try to manufacture a play out of it vs. your job already being done...\"\n\nWatch the clip below:\n\nKemba's been balling out for \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8@kobebryant gives his full analysis on \"Detail,\" only on ESPN+ \u27a1 https://t.co/pBY4P4bkkr pic.twitter.com/KKqJ8aReUX \u2014 NBA on ESPN (@ESPNNBA) September 5, 2019\n\nIt wasn't all criticism from Bryant, though. He had plenty of praise for the Celtics guard throughout the \"Detail\" episode, which you can watch here if you're subscribed to ESPN+.\n\nThere's no doubt Walker would appreciate any constructive criticism from an all-time great like Bryant, just as Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum did when the five-time NBA champion broke down their respective games.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalker has been Team USA's best all-around player in the FIBA World Cup. He finished with 15 points and eight assists in Thursday's blowout victory over Japan.\n\nUSA Basketball's next matchup will take place on Saturday at 8:30 a.m. ET vs. Greece.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
