His last release was Saaho along with Prabhas which was a massive success and now he is coming with Bypass Road, a thriller film which he has himself written.\n\nTwitter\n\nTalking about the love for thriller films, Neil recalled his initial days, \u201cI personally love this genre, I cater to this genre ever since I started my career, I was told by lots of directors and producers before my start that I shouldn\u2019t even try acting because I belong to singing family and it will never work.\n\nI wasn\u2019t given the opportunity, many doors were shut for me, but I had this conviction and confidence that at some point of time I would like to prove myself as an actor, and at that time many stars also used to tell me first you become a star, acting you will learn, but I was scared that if I attract only stardom then I might get lost in this whole gambit of trying to make it as an actor.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss 30.3 K SHARES 5 K SHARES 12.3 K SHARES 3.6 K SHARES 2.8 K SHARES\n\nTwitter\n\n\u201cSo it was a very conscious decision to try and find a script and a filmmaker who was going to give a launch to a newcomer in a thriller and that time there were very few directors who were making thrillers. Sriram Raghvan had made Ek Haseena Thi and I had no idea that he was going to make Johnny Gaddar, and that time I met a producer Jammu ji who was willing to give a chance to a newcomer and I got Johnny Gaddar where I made a debut as an actor at the age of 23. Believe me, after that the same subject was offered to me by 20 other directors\", he added.\n\nTwitter\n\nTalking about how things changed with his very first film Neil said, \u201cToday, I have a great amount of goodwill and respect. I think I have been lucky that soon after my first film the question on my acting capability wasn\u2019t repeated ever. I got a great high with Johnny Gaddar, there have been times where audiences have liked and not liked my performances and that is perfectly okay and I respect their point of view.\n\nThe fact that I worked with 15 National Award winner directors indicates my honour as an actor, it gives me the confidence that there are set of directors who consider me worthy as an actor and will always find me bankable when it comes to the true potential, my strongest believe is that success has to come when it has to come, I can\u2019t wait for it. I have to keep working hard and I can't really expect to be favoured out of turn. I work 24 hours literally, I don\u2019t take breaks. I try and put as much as hard work I can in my work.\"\n\nTwitter\n\nTalking about not receiving much success, Neil said, \u201cTo be honest I have not yet evaluated my career graph to be successful or not successful because of the box office numbers. For many people, I am not as successful because most of my films haven\u2019t done as well but for me I am very happy as an artist because of my body of work till now.\n\nI am very happy that I have been able to every time push myself as an actor, not denying the fact that commercial and popular cinema is important, I do that as well, but if I do a Johnny Gaddar, I will do a New York, or if I am doing a Bypass Road, I\u2019m also doing a Saaho. So I always try to balance my commercial element because I understand successful films is important and being a part of 100 crore films is also important.\u201d\n\nTwitter\n\nWhen asked how fair it is to judge actors calibre on the box office numbers, he laughed off and said, \u201cI have witnessed in my career that if a film of mine hasn\u2019t done well, I have been replaced, but even the filmmaker knew that he wanted me as an actor because I would do justice to that role but he didn\u2019t. Box office success is all business game, success is just one Friday away literally and I am hoping that one Friday comes to me and I am working hard for that. \u201c\n\nNeil also believes today is the best time to experiment an so he is doing a film like Bypass Road, \u201cRight now it\u2019s the best time and that has given the confidence to do a Bypass Road because the audience is lapping up to new content, they are giving the actors like us to survive.\u201d\n\nWe hope he gets the success which he deserves.", "description": "Neil Nitin Mukesh proved his mettle as an actor with his very first film Johnny Gaddar, and ever since then he did some brilliant films like Kabir Khan\u2019s NewYork, Madhur Bhandarkar's Jail, Vishal Bhardwaj\u2019s 7 Khoon Maaf and many more but his luck hasn\u2019t been in his favour.
