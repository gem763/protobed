The event I will compete at is a new up and coming Swedish promotion called \u2018AK Fighting Championship\u2019, which I am also part owner at and it will be amazing.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy competition mind is always there and I would lie if I said this is not a first step but let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d\n\nGustafsson, a three-time UFC light heavyweight title challenger, vows that should he decide to return to MMA competition bra, he\u2019ll be the best version of himself yet.\n\n\u201cAnything can happen but I am sure that when it happens, I will be the best I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\n\nGustafsson\u2019s retirement took many by surprise, including his own team. Losing in his home country of Sweden was a tough pill to swallow, but after some time to reflect, he admits his decision was made out of emotion.\n\n\u201cNobody knew but of course I was really pissed and disappointed of the result,\u201d Gustaffson said. \u201cSo you can say that it probably was in the heat of the moment.\u201d\n\nStepping away from the sport re-ignited the fire a bit Gustafsson, who has been a top ranked 205-pounder for the majority of his UFC career.\n\n\u201cThat, I believe I needed to do honestly,\u201d Gustafsson said. \u201cI believe that you sometimes need to take a break to realize what you have and that is not only meant for sports only but life in general.\u201d\n\nShould \u201cThe Mauler\u201d return to UFC competition, he no longer has anyone specific in mind. He had initially mentioned wanting to fight former middleweight champion Luke Rockhold, but for now, he\u2019ll decide when the time comes.\n\n\u201cNo I honestly don\u2019t have anyone special in mind,\u201d Gustafsson said. \u201cI will take it when it comes to that point.\u201d", "description": "Alexander Gustafsson admits grappling match is one step closer to a potential UFC return, vows to be the best version of himself yet.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Simon Head", "Brian Garcia", "Matt Erickson", "Ken Hathaway", "George Garcia"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/alexander-gustafsson-ufc-on-espn-plus-11-1-1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
