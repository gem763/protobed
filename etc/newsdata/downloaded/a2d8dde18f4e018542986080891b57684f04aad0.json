The PM also used a newspaper interview to liken himself to the Incredible Hulk, poised to break free of the EU\u2019s \u201cmanacles\u201d, saying: \u201cThe madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets.\u201d\n\nThe parallel prompted annoyance in Brussels. Guy Verhofstadt, the chief Brexit representative for the European parliament, tweeted that it was \u201cinfantile\u201d.\n\nGuy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) Even to Trumpian standards the Hulk comparison is infantile. Is the EU supposed to be scared by this? The British public impressed? Is this Boris Johnson whistling in the dark? https://t.co/g6FwEQCTMG\n\nAnother EU source said: \u201cIt all makes it look like it\u2019s a bit of a joke. We are talking about something extremely serious. The consequences of no deal will be extremely serious and it looks like this is being treated as a game in which you are the hero sort of story rather than [dealing] with real lives.\u201d\n\nJohnson had told the Mail on Sunday there were \u201creal signs of movement\u201d in Berlin, Paris and Dublin on getting rid of the backstop. He used his Monday Telegraph column to repeat that he \u201cpassionately believed\u201d a deal was possible. He was supported by senior UK ministers, who talked up the likelihood of an imminent agreement.\n\n\u201cThe entire machinery of government, now, is focused on getting that deal and is planning and preparing to leave on 31 October with a deal,\u201d the home secretary, Priti Patel, told the BBC.\n\nPlay Video 0:37 The entire machinery of government is focused on getting a Brexit deal, says Priti Patel \u2013 video\n\nBut EU officials involved in talks with Johnson\u2019s envoy, David Frost, have dismissed such upbeat accounts.\n\n\u201cNo, in fact people are a bit dismayed,\u201d the EU source said, describing the mood after the latest talks. \u201cI am not even going to call them negotiations \u2013 the last session on Friday did start touching on content \u2013 that\u2019s actually quite a step forward \u2026 but we still should have been there a long time ago and [an end result] is still quite far away.\u201d\n\nJuncker said a no-deal Brexit would be a mess and take years to resolve. Speaking to Deutschlandfunk, he said patriots in the UK \u201cwould not wish your country such a fate\u201d.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing normal about this beast of a government | Matthew d\u2019Ancona Read more\n\nHe said the EU knew what the British did not want, but were still waiting for alternative backstop proposals: \u201cI hope we can get them, but time is running out.\u201d\n\nDowning Street, which is now bound by a rebel backbench law mandating a Brexit extension to at least 31 January if no deal can be reached by mid-October, something Johnson has insisted it will not do, is pinning its hopes on a replacement for the backstop, a fallback plan for avoiding a hard Irish border.\n\nThe hope would be to find ways to allow Northern Ireland to stay converged on some border issues with the Republic of Ireland, preventing frontier checks while not having a full customs border in the Irish Sea \u2013 a compromise acceptable in Brussels but not be seen as a betrayal by Conservative MPs.\n\nThe Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, said ministers were starting to \u201csee a landing zone in terms of a future deal\u201d, albeit with more work to be done.\n\nIt was, he told Sky News, vital to both get the consent of all political sides in Northern Ireland, but also to abide by the Good Friday agreement, which could potentially be breached by a hard Irish border.\n\n\u201cIt is important we move forwards with the consent of both sides of the community in Northern Ireland,\u201d said Barclay, who is due to meet the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, this week. \u201cThat\u2019s very much part of the thinking and part of the consultations that we\u2019re having.\u201d\n\nFrost used Friday\u2019s talks with the EU to outline ideas for such an all-Ireland regulatory regime for food and agriculture, which Downing Street thinks would go a long way to replacing the backstop.\n\nBrussels thinks these ideas fall far short of what is required to protect European markets from dangerous goods, fraud or unfair competition. EU officials say food safety, animal, plant and health measures cannot be separated from customs, because otherwise no one would know what is entering European markets.\n\nOfficials say the UK has put forward unfinished ideas on sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, which leave many questions unanswered, such as definitions of SPS goods and the scope of SPS regulations.\n\n\u201cAs the UK starts exploring the question and starts to put ideas forward, they are starting to realise how complex SPS is,\u201d the EU source said.\n\nHowever, officials see some positive steps: they think the UK has agreed to \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d on food and agriculture, meaning Northern Ireland would automatically accept updates to the EU rulebook in these areas.", "description": "Breaking \u2018manacles\u2019 comments come a day before PM travels for Brexit talks in Luxembourg", "authors": ["Peter Walker", "Jennifer Rankin", "Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a37826ddf15359c9dadf1dd8434044ddf28dc3e7/87_0_4191_2515/master/4191.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6a8604386d4de1188ec66e706bea967e", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
