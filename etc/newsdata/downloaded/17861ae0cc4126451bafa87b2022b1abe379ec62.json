Here's Everything to Know About the September Debate", "language": "en", "text": "On Sept. 12, for the first time, the top polling candidates in the Democratic 2020 presidential primary will face each other on the same party-sanctioned debate stage.\n\nThe third Democratic presidential primary debate \u2014 which ABC News in partnership with Univision will host \u2014 will take place in Texas, and last for three hours. Because only 10 candidates hit the Democratic National Committee\u2019s polling and fundraising thresholds by the Aug. 28 deadline, it will span only one night for the first time.\n\nEffectively cutting the field in half (20 candidates are currently running), the stage will include many of the primary\u2019s front runners: Former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, California Sen. Kamala Harris and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg will all appear.\n\nA single night of debate may draw new contrasts between candidates. Biden and Warren \u2014 who according to RealClearPolitics are on polling on average in first and second \u2014 will be on the same stage for the first time. Warren and Harris, the two top polling women, will also appear on the same stage for the first time.\n\nDynamics from the previous debates may also remerge. Harris criticized Biden on race in the first debate, and faced attacks on her history in law enforcement during the second debate. Warren and Sanders, who represent a similar left-wing of the party, haven\u2019t attacked each other yet but may feel pressure to as the field slims down.\n\nFollowing the threat of Hurricane Dorian on the Southeastern seaboard and a spree of mass shootings in August (53 people died in mass shooting in the U.S. in August alone), climate change and gun violence will likely be discussed. The usual hot-bottom Democratic topics of health care, immigration and the economy will also surely come up.\n\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about the September Democratic Debate.\n\nWhen is the debate?\n\nThe third Democratic presidential primary debate will take place on Thursday, Sept. 12, in Houston, Texas. ABC News in partnership with Univision will host the debate at Texas Southern University, a public, historically black university. It will air from 8 to 11 p.m. EDT.\n\nEach candidate will have one minute and 15 seconds to directly respond to questions from moderators and 45 seconds to respond to follow-up questions and rebuttals. Candidates will give opening statements, but no closing statements.\n\nThe candidates will stand on stage based on their polling averages, with the higher polling candidates near the center of the stage.\n\nThe DNC had announced that if more than 10 candidates qualified, it would held a second debate on Sept. 13. However, despite strong pushes from candidates who were close to qualifying, such as billionaire hedge-fund founder Tom Steyer, only 10 candidates qualified and the debate remained on one night.\n\nWhich candidates qualified for the September Democratic Debate?\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang, Mayor of South Bend, Ind., Pete Buttigieg, Former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen.

The candidates also needed at least 130,000 unique donors, with 400 unique donors per state in at least 20 states. The donations must have been received by 11:59 p.m. Aug. 28.\n\nHere\u2019s who made the cut:\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, 76", "description": "Only 10 candidates will face off in the third 2020 Democratic Debate, all on the same night", "authors": ["Madeleine Carlisle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/88MYo9Bp.fe365AQ5wxQ7w--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/3c8f29c97910b16728c8bd6c6297cfd7", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
