They are the limited trade agreement with US and the finalization of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).\n\nIt is reasonable to assume at this stage that a successful outcome on both agreements is unlikely at this point in time. Even if all stakeholders believe a deal represents a step forward, reaching one hasn\u2019t been harder in almost two decades.\n\nTo put that gloomy conclusion in perspective, it is necessary to take a look at the overall environment for global trade.\n\nIt is dismal.\n\nTo illustrate, the World Trade Organization\u2019s annual report for 2019 shows that the challenges confronting trade negotiators across the world are getting tougher.\n\nAccording to WTO\u2019s Director-General Roberto Azevedo, the year 2018 was a tough one because of mounting trade tensions, an increase in trade restrictive measures and continuing economic uncertainty.\n\nIn 2017, merchandise trade grew at 4.6%. The next year the growth rate dropped to 3%. In the current year it is forecast to grow at 2.6%.\n\nWTO does not expect a dramatic turnaround the next year.\n\nOne aspect of WTO\u2019s trade data is an insightful measure of the obstacles to a trade deal caused by mounting trade tensions.\n\nIn 2018, WTO members initiated 38 new disputes, which was more than twice the number of disputes initiated in 2017.\n\nSince WTO\u2019s entry into force in 1995, 2018 recorded the third largest number of annual dispute filings. Things haven\u2019t been this bad since 1998.\n\nJuxtapose the WTO dispute data with an observation by US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross last week that India is a protectionist country, the possibility of a limited trade deal with US seems difficult to pull off at this time.", "description": "India is currently engaged in two important trade negotiations.
