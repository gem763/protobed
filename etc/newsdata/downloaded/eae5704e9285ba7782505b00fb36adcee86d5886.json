(Nintendo)\n\nThat game was well-loved, but had many limitations because it was released on the Game Boy.\n\nNow on the Switch, we\u2019re all hoping that they\u2019ve patched up some of the old shortcomings so we can enjoy this game in all its cuteness, while also having a solid Zelda experience.\n\nLuigi\u2019s Mansion 3\n\nWhen I first heard of Luigi's Mansion, I was definitely confused.\n\nMario's brother inherits a mansion, discovers that it's haunted and then decides to get rid of all the ghosts by sucking them into his super-powered vacuum.\n\nNot exactly your average game formula, but this just might work.\n\nWhen I\u2019ve played these games in the past, it was when I was just looking for a bit of fun, and that's exactly what this series has always offered.\n\nPrepare for a scare! The original Luigi\u2019s Mansion came out for the GameCube in 2001. (Nintendo)\n\nOn top of that, you play as Luigi, which I think is a major bonus.\n\nI love this lanky green plumber, and it\u2019s great seeing his reactions to all the different ghost types that are found in the mansion (including ghost dogs!).\n\nOverall, If you\u2019re looking for polished, entertaining experience, this is the game you should look out for.\n\nSkatebird\n\nThis game is definitely not at the top of most people's lists.\n\nBefore you start calling me crazy, just hear me out.\n\nThis game comes from an indie developer and involves the player doing sick skateboard tricks as a hawk named Tony.\n\nNo, I\u2019m not joking.\n\nOn top of that, according to the game developers, Skatebird is \u201call about trying your best.\u201d\n\nThat's adorable!\n\nEver seen a bird do a kickflip before? I thought not. Soar and skate to new heights in Skatebird. (Glass Bottom Games)\n\nSorry, Link's Awakening, Skatebird just took the No. 1 cutest game award of 2019.\n\nHonestly though, this game looks like tons of fun, and sometimes it's good to try games from smaller developers.\n\nThey might really surprise you.\n\nPokemon Sword and Shield\n\nTo round off this list is one of the greatest franchises of all time \u2014 Pokemon.\n\nThis game doesn\u2019t do anything super radical to change the formula, but that could be a good thing.\n\nThe last main series game \u2014 Let\u2019s Go Pikachu! \u2014 was definitely a departure from some of the older games like Red and Blue or Diamond and Pearl (my personal favourites).\n\nTwo new legendary Pok\u00e9mon, Zacian and Zamazenta will be available to catch in game. (Nintendo)\n\nSo many fans are excited for the return of the old battling and catching mechanics.\n\nPlus, there are some new features: there\u2019s a new region to explore, a new mechanic allowing trainers to \u201csupersize\u201d their Pokemon and more than 1,000 total Pokemon to catch.\n\nThat really must have been easier when there were only 151.\n\nThat\u2019s my list! I hope there was at least one game on here that caught your attention.\n\n\n\nWhich are you most looking forward to?
