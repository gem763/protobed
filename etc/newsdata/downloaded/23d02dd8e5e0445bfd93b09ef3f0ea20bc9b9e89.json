Smith said at a news conference last week. \u201cI think everyone wants to see this young baby found and back home.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut on Tuesday night, the hope that had fueled the days-long search for Kamille was replaced by grief.\n\nAD\n\nHuman remains believed to be Kamille\u2019s were found in a dumpster at a landfill in Birmingham, Smith said at a news conference \u2014 a grim development in an abduction that has captivated the city of more than 200,000 and made national headlines. Now, police are planning to charge two people, who have no apparent connection to the girl or her family, with kidnapping and murder.\n\n\u201cLocating the remains were the last pieces of the puzzle\u201d investigators needed to bring charges against Patrick Devone Stallworth, 39, and his girlfriend, Derick Irisha Brown, 29, Smith said. The pair were arrested on unrelated charges shortly after Kamille went missing and questioned about the child. As of Tuesday, Brown was still in jail and Stallworth, who posted bond, was taken into custody again, Smith said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe believe that this was something that they thought about and acted upon,\u201d he said. \u201cThey saw an opportunity to take a young child, which they did. Further investigation will reveal what action happened after that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAttorneys for Stallworth and Brown did not respond to requests for comment early Wednesday, but have previously said their clients are innocent, the Associated Press reported. Emory Anthony, Stallworth\u2019s attorney, told the AP on Friday that his client has an alibi for the time of the alleged kidnapping. Adam Danneman, a public defender whose office is representing Brown, said she was \u201chorrified\u201d by Kamille\u2019s disappearance, but \u201cadamantly denies\u201d knowing anything about the abduction, according to the AP.\n\nTuesday\u2019s news was met with an outpouring of support from the community, including leaders such as Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin (D) and Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R).\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOur entire city is mourning,\u201d Woodfin said at the news conference. \u201cKamille is gone, ripped away from her family. The pain her family is enduring is unimaginable.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement shared on Twitter, Ivey offered her \u201cheartfelt condolences\u201d to the young girl\u2019s loved ones.\n\n\u201cThe heart of our state is broken, but our resolve must be to do everything we can to avoid this tragedy from happening to another family,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cOur prayers are with Kamille\u2019s family and all who have been touched by this nightmare.\u201d\n\nThe heart of our state is broken, but our resolve must be to do everything we can to avoid this tragedy from happening to another family. Our prayers are with Kamille\u2019s family and all who have been touched by this nightmare. \u2014 Governor Kay Ivey (@GovernorKayIvey) October 23, 2019\n\nKamille was last seen about 8:30 p.m. on Oct. 12 at a public housing community in Birmingham, where she and her relatives had gathered to celebrate a birthday. The youngster, dressed in a pink T-shirt with a Minnie Mouse design and leopard print shorts, was playing outside with another child when a man suddenly approached, according to surveillance video released by police last week.\n\nAD\n\nThe man, who appeared to walk with a slight limp, briefly paused in front of the two children before moving along, the video showed. As he disappeared from the camera\u2019s view, the children scampered behind him.\n\nAD\n\nMoments later, Kamille was gone, police said.\n\nVideo Surveillance of two men who may have information that can help us locate Cupcake. Kamille Mckinney The video was recovered from a surveillance camera within the Tom Brown Housing complex at about the same time as Kamille Mckinney was reported missing.

Posted by Birmingham Police Department (AL) Major Crimes on Friday, October 18, 2019\n\nChildren attending the party said they saw a man get out of a sport-utility vehicle and put Kamille in the car, AL.com reported, prompting police to launch a search for the suspect and vehicle, later described as a dark-colored Toyota Sequoia with a beige trim.\n\nAlmost exactly 24 hours after Kamille was allegedly taken, authorities made their first major breakthrough in the case. Residents reported seeing a car that matched the police\u2019s description outside a condominium not far from where the girl was abducted, according to AL.com. Smith told reporters on Tuesday that the tip about the SUV was just one of the clues that led investigators to Stallworth and Brown.\n\nAD\n\nStallworth was detained on child pornography charges, which were not related to the alleged abduction, while Brown was arrested for an unrelated kidnapping, the AP reported.\n\nAD\n\nAs police continued their investigation, which included questioning the couple and canvassing the city, Kamille\u2019s family was also out looking.\n\nDominic McKinney, the girl\u2019s father, told reporters on Oct. 13 that he wasn\u2019t going to get any sleep, according to WVTM. \u201cI been out all night. I look through everything around here. Every empty school, every abandoned building, and I won\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\nMcKinney later added: \u201cThey could have took her to Jupiter. We\u2019re going to find her.\u201d\n\nThe urgent search efforts, however, weren\u2019t turning up much. Large rewards for information were announced and countless tips were called in, but nothing was leading to Kamille, Smith told reporters at a news conference early last week.\n\nAD\n\nOn Oct. 16, Smith changed his tactics, delivering a direct appeal to people he believed had information about Kamille.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you know where Kamille is, if you have her and you\u2019re not sure what to do, I want to just talk to you for one second,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI want to give you safe passage. \u2026 If you don\u2019t know what to do or where to go and you\u2019re frightened, we\u2019re here to help you.\u201d\n\nBy Friday, almost a week after Kamille\u2019s disappearance, Smith told reporters he was still hopeful that the child would be found.\n\n\u201cIn my heart, I believe she is in and around the area and we\u2019re hoping to bring her home safely,\u201d he said.\n\nSmith was right \u2014 Kamille probably never left Birmingham.\n\nAD\n\nThe girl\u2019s remains were found in a dumpster, which was later moved to a landfill, that had been parked near the apartment complex where the SUV was located, Smith said Tuesday, noting that police had been searching through trash from a specific area of the city. Smith said authorities planned to seek warrants for the kidnapping and murder charges on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe can no longer assume that everyone is a part of the village that is trying to raise the child,\u201d he said. \u201cThis young child has touched a nation. This young child has definitely sent a message across the nation that we all must be diligent to protect them all.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Human remains believed to be Kamille \"Cupcake\" McKinney's were found in a dumpster at a landfill in Birmingham, Ala., police said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-7gGL7WcdHt5C5a6u5U7IrvQNV4=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-23-2019/t_2833b79b0d774c368f7d371f7c111342_name_Screen_Shot_2019_10_23_at_5_20_48_AM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
