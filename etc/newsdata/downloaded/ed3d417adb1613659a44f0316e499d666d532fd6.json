Trump said he did not endorse the invasion, but by withdrawing troops he'd given Erdogan a greenlight to move forward with it.\n\nDuring a press conference in Japan months before, Trump boasted about how he'd stopped Erdogan from going into Syria to \"wipe out\" the Kurds. Fast-forward to October, and Trump abruptly stepped aside to allow Erdogan to target a group who lost 11,000 fighters as they served as America's battering ram in the effort that crushed ISIS's caliphate.\n\nThe credibility of the US is now down the tubes, US lawmakers and former officials say.\n\n\"We're a laughing stock. We're the butt of jokes. Nobody is going to want to partner with us now,\" Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy told Insider on Tuesday. \"And I don't know that a Democratic president can recover from this. It's just devastating what President Trump has done to American credibility.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump attends a bilateral meeting with Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan during the G20 leaders summit in Osaka, Japan, June 29, 2019. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nTrump gave Erdogan everything he wants\n\nTrump wrote a letter to Erdogan the day after Turkey launched the invasion into Syria, urging him not to be a \"tough guy.\" The Turkish leader, who is widely regarded as an autocrat and enemy to democracy, reportedly threw it into the trash.\n\nLast Friday, US forces in northern Syria came under fire from Turkish artillery. Though no Americans were hurt, some US officials believed this was intentional and meant to push the US out. This would be an astonishingly bold move, given the US and Turkey are technically allies as fellow NATO members.\n\nSubsequently, Trump told the Pentagon to begin withdrawing the remaining 1,000 US troops in northern Syria.\n\nThe Turkish invasion has sparked a humanitarian crisis in Syria, and over 300,000 have reportedly been displaced since it began. Meanwhile, Turkish-backed Syrian Arab militants have reportedly committed war crimes against the Kurds. ISIS is also regrouping, and Russia has won a major geopolitical victory.\n\n'Turkey forced the hand of the US'\n\nOn Thursday, the Trump administration announced a deal had been met with Turkey for a five-day suspension in military operations in northern Syria to allow Kurdish forces to withdrawal. This came after Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Turkey to meet with Erdogan. Pence characterized the agreement as a ceasefire, but the Turkish foreign minister promptly disputed this.\n\nThe agreement means the US has effectively negotiated the surrender of the Kurds in a conflict that was sparked by Trump's decision. Turkey gets everything it wants: Kurdish forces it views as terrorists are ceding territory and the US has agreed to lift recently imposed sanctions once a permanent ceasefire is established.\n\nA day after the House overwhelmingly voted in favor of a resolution condemning Trump's Syria retreat, the president celebrated the deal and praised Erdogan, calling him a \"hell of a leader.\"\n\nBut many US lawmakers, including some Republicans, are not satisfied and feel Turkey has walked all over the US.\n\nIn a blistering speech on Thursday, GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah said, \"The announcement today is being portrayed as a victory. It is far from a victory.\" Romney said: \"Are we so weak and so inept diplomatically that Turkey forced the hand of the United States of America? Turkey?!\"\n\nEchoing views that have been shared by many of his colleagues over the past week or so, Romney went on to say: \"The decision to abandon the Kurds violates one of our most sacred duties. It strikes at American honor. What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a blood stain in the annals of American history.\"", "description": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has walked all over the US in the past few weeks, and President Donald Trump let him.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da8d7ee4af9093c7317e0b8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
