Inadvertently, Donald Trump is forcing the end of this ambivalence.\n\nThe more the US President unwinds his country\u2019s external commitments, the more other nations see the resultant damage to the global commons.\n\nHis decision to expose Kurds in Syria to Turkish forces has been the most clarifying moment of all. But there have been others, over trade and climate change. Countries with historic qualms about US power are going through a chastening education in life without it.\n\nThe perverse result: an America First president could bequeath his successor a world that is keener on US leadership than it was before. Behaviour that should be turning countries away from America is likelier to remind them of its indispensability.\n\nThose that have always been in two minds about Pax Americana are being confronted with the alternative for perhaps the first time in memory. Bloomberg\n\nThe romantic account of the world before Mr Trump could turn out to be truer of the world that will come after him. This outcome is no less profound for being unintended.\n\nIt is natural to assume that America\u2019s recent perfidy will force allies to quit its orbit. If there is any doubt about its commitment to them \u2013 and the treatment of the Kurds is stirring those doubts \u2013 they would have no choice but to make other arrangements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this is so much easier said than done as to be hardly worth saying at all. What would those arrangements be? The EU is an economic superpower but hardly a unitary actor at all in diplomatic or military terms. China has the wherewithal to lead, but which liberal democracy could feel relaxed about entering its gravitational tug?\n\nThen there is the little matter \u2013 always underweighed in diplomatic circles \u2013 of public opinion. In Europe, Asia and Africa, crushing majorities preferred a US-led world to a China-led one, or \u201cboth\u201d or \u201cneither\u201d, according to Pew Research Center, as recently as 2018.\n\nSubstituting for the US is improbable, then, at least in the medium term. If its next president wants to revive the country\u2019s leading role, the allies will still be there to be led. If anything, they will be more biddable than they were.\n\nThose that have always been in two minds about Pax Americana are being confronted with the alternative for perhaps the first time in memory. The worst they have known until now was the unilateral militarism of Mr Bush (whose main Western victim, in lives lost and cash blown, was the US itself) and the well-meaning tentativeness of Barack Obama.\n\nThey are now tasting real abandonment. Old misgivings about American hyperpuissance are starting to seem rather beside the point. The point is to entice the US back on to what Ivo Daalder, its former NATO ambassador, calls the \u201cempty throne\u201d.\n\nNone of this is to predict \u2013 or hope \u2013 that allies will become uncritical of the US through sheer cringing gratitude at having it back. Where they defied its judgment in the past, they were often right, as over the wars in Vietnam and Iraq.\n\nThey brought a pessimistic cast of mind that does not occur naturally in Washington, where grandiosity is designed into the built environment.\n\nBut there was something else, a John le Carr\u00e9-ish cynicism about the US, that was allowed to pass for too long because it seemed worldly. It made sport of the lumbering giant even as it counted on it to stick around. This was a costless prejudice.\n\nThere was never real doubt about America\u2019s reliability. That is no longer the case. It would be strange if the unfolding shock did not focus allied minds in future.\n\nWe overrated the togetherness of the democratic world before President Trump. We are underrating the unity he will leave behind. janan.ganesh@ft.com\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "The more the US President unwinds his country\u2019s external commitments, the more other nations see the resultant damage to the global commons.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1964%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/08a3676cb376cc0871b76b8dbb3d9364dfdecd69", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
