Now, sadly, it looks like Leicester is following suit.\u2019\n\nUniversity of Leicester\u2019s students\u2019 union said the messages displayed were \u2018wholly unacceptable\u2019.\n\nIn a statement, it said: \u2018Offensive behaviour that marginalises any group within our community constitutes a breach of the regulations governing student discipline and we have launched an inquiry into this incident through a disciplinary process.\n\n\u2018The students\u2019 union requires all those associated with the students\u2019 union to respect the diverse lived experiences in our community.\n\nThe picture was sent to the university\u2019s Jewish Society (Picture: Facebook)\n\n\u2018It is not acceptable to act in an offensive, inflammatory or discriminatory way and we continue to develop extensive training, support and guidance available to clubs, societies and associations on our values and expected behaviour.\n\n\u2018The entire executive team would like to sincerely apologise for the incident and take accountability for this students\u2019 behaviour.\n\n\u2018We will ensure we tackle any anti-Semitism and make it wholly clear that white T-shirt socials are not allowable by the union.\u2019\n\nThe Campaign Against Anti-Semitism is said to be monitoring the situation.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
