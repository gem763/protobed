That is imperative to realize the green transition globally,\u201d Frederiksen said in a statement.\n\nThe funds will bring the total green investments to 511 billion crowns. Danish private pension funds, which doesn\u2019t include public pension fund ATP, currently hold assets worth 3,100 billion crowns.\n\nEnvironmental groups say the New York climate summit is coming at a crucial time, as extreme weather events and spiking temperatures affect more people in more parts of the globe.\n\nDenmark\u2019s biggest private pension provider, PFA Pension, which manages more than 600 billion Danish crowns, will focus investments in offshore wind farms and photovoltaic energy as well as climate-friendly properties and energy storage.\n\n\u201cThere are quite big financing needs in many energy projects,\u201d Allan Polack, PFA\u2019s chief executive told Reuters and said PFA would invest in both shares and bonds as well as stakes in unlisted companies and projects.\n\n\u201cBut the exciting thing about the energy sector is the transformation. We are trying to get BP, Shell and Total and others to adapt and become far more climate friendly in their energy production,\u201d Polack said.\n\nMore than 90 big companies, including Denmark\u2019s wind turbine maker Vestas and wind farm developer Orsted, both market leaders, have promised to slash emissions in a new campaign launched ahead of Monday\u2019s climate summit.", "description": "Danish private pension funds on Monday pledged to invest more than $50 billion in green assets over the next decade to fight climate change, as part of Denmark's ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70% in 2030.", "authors": ["Nikolaj Skydsgaard", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432877587&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0H2", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
