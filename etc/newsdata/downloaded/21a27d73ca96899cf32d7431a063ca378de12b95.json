REUTERS/Gus Ruelas (UNITED STATES - Tags: ENTERTAINMENT HEADSHOT)\n\nEva Mendes is receiving praise from fans for her relatable beauty habit after she shared a picture of herself during a haircut from the no-appointment-required salon Supercuts.\n\nOn Monday, Mendes, who has starred in movies such as Hitch, The Other Guys and the Fast & Furious franchise, as well as serving as the creative director for a Walgreens exclusive makeup line, CIRCA beauty, proved that even stars could benefit from the affordable salon.\n\n\"Ok this is a terrible angle but thought you guys would like to know that yea, I stop into @supercuts every once in awhile,\" Mendes wrote on Instagram, along with a selfie of her in the process of receiving her new hairdo.\n\n\"Y que?!\" she wrote, translating to, \"so what,\" clearly signifying she was pretty impressed with her trim.\n\nImmediately, fans commented on Mendes's post praising her for going to the salon.\n\n\"NOT COOL! Why!? Why do you continue to prove that you are a down to Earth human being who embodies the meaning of being an [angel] on Earth!?\" one person joked.\n\nOne person wrote \"Love it; keeping it real,\" while another shared \"This makes me love you even more!\"\n\nWhile some commented that her humbleness was endearing, others related to the quick cut.\n\n\"They\u2019re great for a trim and quick layer!\" one fan shared.\n\nBut this is not the first time Mendes has proved to be a savvy consumer.\n\nLast month, the actress shared a throwback photo at her first appearance at the Toronto International Film Festival. She admitted she had no stylist and that her dress cost her only $15.\n\n\"I wasn\u2019t doing a 'red carpet pose,\" Mendes wrote. \"No I don\u2019t long for that time, I just liked the simplicity of it all.\"\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Actress Eva Mendes received praise for posting a selfie during her haircut at Supercuts.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Vi0w0vZ9zeY6_dV74EaikA--~B/aD0yNDIzO3c9MzM5MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/b10020b0-eef3-11e9-bfdd-42243fd31888", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
