Earlier this week investors worried about a potential downturn pushed the S&P 500 down more than 1% in back-to-back sessions for the first time this year.\n\nBut the index is now on track to end a rocky week with a modest 0.8% loss after rebounding Thursday and Friday. Stocks were buoyed by expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut rates to shore up the economy and sustain the current expansion.\n\nInvestors are betting the Fed will slash rates as soon as October. Friday's jobs report did little to change those expectations. Even though the U.S. economy has been more resilient than others around the world, surveys of manufacturing and service-sector activity have hinted at future weakness that could eventually trickle into the labor market.\n\n\"The market has grabbed onto the narrative that bad news is good news,\" said Rusty Vanneman, chief investment officer of Orion Advisor Services.\n\nAmong the concerning reports: U.S. factory activity contracted for a second straight month and hit a 10-year low and the pace of growth in the services sector slowed as well.\n\nInvestors' reliance on the Fed as a backstop was on display Thursday, when the Institute for Supply Management said its nonmanufacturing index hit a three-year low. Stocks initially dropped sharply, but they then swung higher as investors ramped up bets that the Fed will slash rates again this year after two cuts in the third quarter.\n\nTraders are betting on a roughly 42% chance of the central bank lowering its benchmark short-term interest rate two more times by the end of the year, according to the CME Group, up from 20% last week.\n\nThe S&P ticked up 0.9% Friday on broad-based gains. Only the index's energy sector traded lower on the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 244 points, or 0.9%. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.8%. The S&P 500 and Dow remained on track for their third consecutive week of losses, while the Nasdaq turned positive for the week.\n\nThe U.S. economy added 136,000 jobs in September, the Labor Department said. The jobless rate dropped to 3.5% in September from 3.7% in August, marking a 50-year low. Economists had predicted an increase of 140,000 jobs and a steady unemployment rate at 3.7%.\n\n\"It continues to show that the U.S. economy is a jobs machine,\" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. \"But again it's strange compared to everything else going on. All the other numbers we've seen for the past week have not painted a very nice picture.\"\n\nFriday's jobs report also revealed other moderating factors. Wage growth continues to be tepid, hinting at a possible decrease in demand for new labor, as growth in average weekly earnings also cooled.\n\nAt a Wall Street Journal event in New York on Thursday, Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said the central bank will do what it takes to keep the longest period of U.S. economic expansion going. He added that the central bank takes each policy meeting \"one at a time.\"\n\nLater Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will speak at a Fed Listens event in Washington.\n\nEsty Dwek, a strategist at Natixis Investment Managers, said recent optimism that the global economy would pick up was fading. \"The world has had, if not expectations at least hopes, that we would see a bottom, \" Ms. Dwek said.\n\nElsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.6%, after suffering heavy losses earlier in the week. Japan's Nikkei gained 0.3%. And Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 1.1% after the city's chief executive said a ban would be implemented on wearing masks at public gatherings, with penalties of up to a year in jail and a fine.\n\nStock markets in mainland China were closed.\n\nJoanne Chiu contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.com and Avantika Chilkoti at Avantika.Chilkoti@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 04, 2019 12:43 ET (16:43 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
