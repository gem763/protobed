Or rather, the wall of his front garden is. The 32-year-old artist recently moved from his long-time home in Muswell Hill, north London, to Southampton. He\u2019s loving every minute of the carnage it\u2019s unleashed \u2013 to the point that he and his wife, Charlotte, have decided to bring a puppy, called Whisky, into the chaos.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going through his \u2018teenage phase\u2019,\u201d Kiwanuka says. \u201cHe\u2019s amazing, but I\u2019m always travelling, so Charlotte has to deal with him.\u201d He lived around Kentish Town and Camden before he met his wife, and was out every night. \u201cI don\u2019t regret that,\u201d he says, \u201cbut you get to a stage when you want to settle down. And I\u2019m lucky that I\u2019m at a stage in my career where I don\u2019t need to hustle so much.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s sitting in a nondescript cafe in Aldgate, sipping a coffee while a man in a suit has a noisy phone conversation behind us. Kiwanuka, who is dressed casually in a wool check shirt, doesn\u2019t seem to notice: he\u2019s talking happily about his third record, the self-titled Kiwanuka. And you can\u2019t blame him \u2013 it\u2019s a fantastic album, Kiwanuka\u2019s best by a mile, even after 2012\u2019s debut Home Again, and the critically adored Love & Hate (2016), both of which were shortlisted for the Mercury Prize.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nA quieter existence seems to suit him. He\u2019s a calming presence to be around, with huge soulful eyes and a relaxed demeanour that he took into the studio. Kiwanuka relies far more on instinct than any of his previous work: it opens on the jangling, Kamasi Washington-esque \u201cYou Ain\u2019t the Problem\u201d, a defiant track borne of Kiwanuka\u2019s feelings of inferiority in an industry that is at once highly competitive and quick to celebrate mediocrity over genuine talent. More than one article has posed the question as to why Kiwanuka isn\u2019t more successful than he is. More often than not, the conclusion is: his peers are white, he is not.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s slowly changing, but if you think about the artists that break through...\u201d He trails off. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve become so obsessed with identity. The way people listen to artists, including myself, is also with your eyes.\u201d At school, Kiwanuka\u2019s friends were white and middle-class, and most of them had musical instruments bought for them by their parents. Kiwanuka was impressed by the ones who could play guitar, and persuaded his parents \u2013 who fled Uganda during Idi Amin\u2019s murderous regime in the Seventies \u2013 to let him pursue a career in music on the condition he studied at university (he attended the Royal Academy of Music but later dropped out).\n\n\u201cThe guitar didn\u2019t used to be seen as an instrument for posh people,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s ingrained in us to relate to someone who looks like we do.\u201d When he was at school, everyone on MTV who looked like him was a rapper, or singing Nineties R&B: \u201cBut then I\u2019d find these old Seventies records, and see people like Jimi Hendrix or Bill Withers, wearing flared jeans and playing guitars.\u201d\n\nHe has ideas of starting a studio in Southampton; his wife is a musician as well, and sang on tracks that didn\u2019t quite make the final album (he says she didn\u2019t mind, but was a \u201cbit gutted\u201d himself). \u201cShe\u2019s got a ridiculously good voice that I want people to hear,\u201c he says. More than anything, he sounds determined to provide a space for local youth: \u201cThere are so many young people in Southampton, and you think that kids in London don\u2019t have anything to do \u2013 imagine what it\u2019s like there.\u201d He wants to start a gallery, too: \u201cWe have all these crazy dreams, and being in Southampton is like a blank canvas.\u201d\n\nSome might find it strange that Kiwanuka would title his third album after himself, where most artists do so for their debut. But it\u2019s a statement of identity by an artist who, until recently, felt caught between the middle-class surroundings of his childhood and the culture of his parents. Even the pronunciation of his name has been anglicised, he says: in Kampala (Uganda\u2019s capital), it\u2019s Chi-wa-nuka.\n\n\u201cThe reason you get disconnected from your heritage and lineage is when it seems alien to what\u2019s around you, and you just want to fit in,\u201d he says, reflecting on the \u201cpervasive\u201d racism he senses in the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to describe \u2013 it\u2019s just subtler. People compartmentalise, they fixate on people from certain backgrounds.\u201d He wants to see more people from different backgrounds and ethnicities in positions of power: \u201cI think that\u2019s when you see the perception of other races change.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. The 35 best debut albums of all time Show all 35 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. The 35 best debut albums of all time 1/35 35) Arctic Monkeys \u2013 Whatever People Say I Am, That\u2019s What I\u2019m Not (2006) A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut \u2013 the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That\u2019s What I\u2019m Not \u2013 is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn\u2019t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner\u2019s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like \u201cFake Tales of San Francisco\u201d and \u201cWhen the Sun Goes Down\u201d had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry \u2013 propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months. 2/35 34) Please Please Me \u2013 The Beatles (1963) Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d and \u201cI Saw Her Standing There\u201d have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band\u2019s raw power. 3/35 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs \u2013 Fever to Tell (2003) In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O\u2019s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of \u201cDate With the Night\u201d and \u201cY Control\u201d. More than trendsetters \u2013 the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year. 4/35 32) Franz Ferdinand \u2013 Franz Ferdinand (2004) Kanye West called it \u201cwhite crunk music\u201d. The band themselves called it \u201cmusic for girls to dance to\u201d. And songs such as \u201cThis Fire\u201d certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like \u201cI can feel your lips undress my eyes\u201d. Fifteeen years later and \u201cTake Me Out\u201d still makes you swing your hips. 5/35 31) Oasis \u2013 Definitely Maybe (1994) Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of \u201cCigarettes & Alcohol\u201d, and soars on that falsetto for \u201cLive Forever\u201d. Among the \u201ctoo cool for school\u201d alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars. 6/35 30) Lady Gaga \u2013 The Fame (2008) Stefani Germanotta\u2019s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop divas. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean her music couldn\u2019t stand on its own. Songs like \u201cBeautiful, Dirty, Rich\u201d and \u201cJust Dance\u201d seemed to convey Gaga\u2019s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences. 7/35 29) Kendrick Lamar \u2013 good kid, m.A.A.d City (2012) Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record \u201cA Short Film by Kendrick Lamar\u201d, and indeed it feels as though you\u2019re watching the movie of his early life \u2013 such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm \u2013 Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline. 8/35 28) Led Zeppelin \u2013 Led Zeppelin (1969) Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their \u201csound\u201d by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. \u201cWe were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,\u201d Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on \u201cBabe I\u2019m Gonna Leave You\u201d, and the chugging rock of \u201cCommunication Breakdown\u201d; Plant\u2019s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page\u2019s guitar. It did the trick. 9/35 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain \u2013 Psychocandy (1985) \u201cIt was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,\u201d Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker\u2019s debut album Psychocandy. \u201cBecause it was like, \u2018Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?\u2019 That was the main driving force: how bad things were.\u201d Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like \u201cYou Trip Me Up\u201d and \u201cNever Understand\u201d. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed. 10/35 26) Jeff Buckley \u2013 Grace (1994) Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cHallelujah\u201d, his melismatic singing on \u201cGrace\u201d and the church-like hush of \u201cLover, You Should Come Over\u201d \u2013 all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley\u2019s music will never fade. 11/35 25) Eminem \u2013 The Slim Shady LP (1999) The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem\u2019s major label debut was a breath of fresh air \u2013 or perhaps more of a slap in the face \u2013 after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called \u201ccharacter\u201d Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were. Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since. 12/35 24) The Who \u2013 My Generation (1965) Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them \u2013 but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who's my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965. 13/35 23) The Strokes \u2013 Is This It (2001) \u201cSaviours of rock and roll!\u201d \u201cThe greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!\u201d You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it\u2019s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music \u2013 critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn\u2019t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands. 14/35 22) Run-DMC \u2013 Run-DMC (1984) The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them \u201cthe first movie stars of rap\u2026 they are The Beatles\u201d. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: \u201cRun-DMC didn\u2019t change music, they changed everything.\u201d The trio\u2019s aggressive yet stark tracks \u2013 like \u201cSucker MCS\u201d and \u201cHard Times\u201d \u2013 were a dramatic contrast against the R&B-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, \u201cthey were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing\u201d. 15/35 21) Roxy Music \u2013 Roxy Music (1972) Brian Eno\u2019s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry\u2019s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music's bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (\u201c2HB\u201d) and cyber-rock jams (\u201cLadytron\u201d), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn\u2019t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno). 16/35 20) Jay-Z \u2013 Reasonable Doubt (1996) Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle \u2013 perhaps the best of his generation \u2013 recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist\u2019s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, \u201cBrooklyn\u2019s Finest\u201d, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East. 17/35 19) Black Sabbath \u2013 Black Sabbath (1970) Rolling Stone's Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as \u201cjust like Cream! But worse\u201d, and their debut album as \u201ca shuck \u2013 despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clich\u00e9s\u201d. The Village Voice weren\u2019t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as \u201cbulls**t necromancy.\u201d Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s piercing, operatic cry: \u201cMy name is Lucifer, please take my hand.\u201d Critics be damned. 18/35 18) Sex Pistols \u2013 Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols (1977) \u201cThe album will last. The sleeve may not,\u201d said the adverts for the Sex Pistols\u2019 first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history. 19/35 17) The Clash \u2013 The Clash (1977) Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn\u2019t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of \u201cCareer Opportunities\u201d and \u201cWhite Riot\u201d, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 20/35 16) Guns N Roses \u2013 Appetite for Destruction (1987) Guns N Roses' Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash\u2019s guitar and Axl Rose\u2019s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like \u201cParadise City\u201d and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time \u2013 proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. \u201cA lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,\u201d Rose said. Not this band. 21/35 15) Daft Punk \u2013 Homework (1996) Daft Punk's Homework was originally intended as \u201cjust a load of singles\u201d, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards \u2013 sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It\u2019s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene. 22/35 14) The Doors \u2013 The Doors (1967) Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you\u2019re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to divide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album\u2019s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman\u2019s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on \u201cLight My Fire\u201d proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200. 23/35 13) Kanye West \u2013 The College Dropout (2004) After making a name for himself on Jay-Z\u2019s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clich\u00e9s, skirting round the dominant \u201cgangsta\u201d persona and instead finding solace in family and the church. Def Jam 24/35 12) Pink Floyd \u2013 The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967) Pink Floyd\u2019s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett \u2013 ousted a year after the album\u2019s release \u2013 it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as \u201cBike\u201d, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 25/35 11) Lauryn Hill \u2013 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998) Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones \u2013 sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky \u2013 the former Fugees member stepped out from rap\u2019s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R&B, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D\u2019Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill\u2019s reggae influences are what drive the album\u2019s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it\u2019s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. 26/35 10) Dizzee Rascal \u2013 Boy in Da Corner (2003) It\u2019s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London\u2019s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track \u201cSittin\u2019 Here\u201d. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener\u2019s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. 27/35 9) Beastie Boys \u2013 Licensed to Ill (1986) Hip hop\u2019s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this \u2013 a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys' Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and \u201cgood time\u201d attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks. 28/35 8) The Notorious BIG \u2013 Ready to Die (1994) The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife\u2019s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was \u201cwaking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids; just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs\u201d, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die \u2013 one of the best debut albums in hip hop \u2013 delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour. 29/35 7) Ramones \u2013 Ramones (1976) At less than 30 minutes, Ramones\u2019 debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener\u2019s veins. It\u2019s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as \u201cBeat on the Brat\u201d and \u201cNow I Wanna Sniff Some Glue\u201d proving to be as surly as the band themselves. \u201cOur early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration \u2013 the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,\u201d singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make. 30/35 6) NWA \u2013 Straight Outta Compton NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren\u2019t positioning themselves as people to look up to: \u201cDo I look like a mother***ing role mode?\u201d he demands on \u201cGangsta Gangsta\u201d. Their track \u201cF*** tha Police\u201d \u2013 a protest track against racism and police brutality \u2013 led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame. 31/35 5) The Velvet Underground \u2013 The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967) Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground & Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico \u2013 the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol\u2019s request \u2013 you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from \u201cVenus in Furs\u201d to \u201cRun Run Run\u201d, but it\u2019s not so much glamour as glam rock \u2013 gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, \u201ceveryone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band\u201d. David Bowie called it \u201cthe future of music\u201d, and 52 years later, it still feels like it. 32/35 4) Jimi Hendrix Experience \u2013 Are You Experienced A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before \u2013 Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R&B, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That\u2019s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as \u201cPurple Haze\u201d. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on \u201cFoxy Lady\u201d. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by \u201cThe Wind Cries Mary\u201d. Hendrix\u2019s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time \u2013 yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. 33/35 3) Patti Smith \u2013 Horses (1975) \u201cJesus died for somebody\u2019s sins, but not mine,\u201d go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith\u2019s debut album Horses. There\u2019s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else\u2019s song (in this case Van Morrison\u2019s \u201cGloria\u201d), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. \u201cShe was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,\u201d Sonic Youth\u2019s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. \u201cIt was life-changing.\u201d 34/35 2) Illmatic \u2013 Nas (1994) How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music; not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around \u2013 Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor \u2013 was a move that Complex blamed for \u201cruining hip hop\u201d, while still praising Nas\u2019s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source\u2019s 1991 track \u201cLive at the BBQ\u201d: \u2018When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.\u201d 35/35 1) Joy Division \u2013 Unknown Pleasures (1979) Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it \u2013 or indeed any album since. It\u2019s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature; indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division's record's grooves make it feel \u201calmost Dostoevskyan\u201d. Peter Hook\u2019s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis\u2019s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On \u201cShe\u2019s Lost Control\u201d it as though you\u2019re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel \u2013 the echoes of Curtis's voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on \u201cI Remember Nothing\u201d, it doesn\u2019t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record. 1/35 35) Arctic Monkeys \u2013 Whatever People Say I Am, That\u2019s What I\u2019m Not (2006) A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut \u2013 the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That\u2019s What I\u2019m Not \u2013 is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn\u2019t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner\u2019s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like \u201cFake Tales of San Francisco\u201d and \u201cWhen the Sun Goes Down\u201d had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry \u2013 propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months. 2/35 34) Please Please Me \u2013 The Beatles (1963) Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d and \u201cI Saw Her Standing There\u201d have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band\u2019s raw power. 3/35 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs \u2013 Fever to Tell (2003) In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O\u2019s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of \u201cDate With the Night\u201d and \u201cY Control\u201d. More than trendsetters \u2013 the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year. 4/35 32) Franz Ferdinand \u2013 Franz Ferdinand (2004) Kanye West called it \u201cwhite crunk music\u201d. The band themselves called it \u201cmusic for girls to dance to\u201d. And songs such as \u201cThis Fire\u201d certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like \u201cI can feel your lips undress my eyes\u201d. Fifteeen years later and \u201cTake Me Out\u201d still makes you swing your hips. 5/35 31) Oasis \u2013 Definitely Maybe (1994) Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of \u201cCigarettes & Alcohol\u201d, and soars on that falsetto for \u201cLive Forever\u201d. Among the \u201ctoo cool for school\u201d alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars. 6/35 30) Lady Gaga \u2013 The Fame (2008) Stefani Germanotta\u2019s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop divas. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean her music couldn\u2019t stand on its own. Songs like \u201cBeautiful, Dirty, Rich\u201d and \u201cJust Dance\u201d seemed to convey Gaga\u2019s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences. 7/35 29) Kendrick Lamar \u2013 good kid, m.A.A.d City (2012) Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record \u201cA Short Film by Kendrick Lamar\u201d, and indeed it feels as though you\u2019re watching the movie of his early life \u2013 such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm \u2013 Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline. 8/35 28) Led Zeppelin \u2013 Led Zeppelin (1969) Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their \u201csound\u201d by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. \u201cWe were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,\u201d Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on \u201cBabe I\u2019m Gonna Leave You\u201d, and the chugging rock of \u201cCommunication Breakdown\u201d; Plant\u2019s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page\u2019s guitar. It did the trick. 9/35 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain \u2013 Psychocandy (1985) \u201cIt was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,\u201d Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker\u2019s debut album Psychocandy. \u201cBecause it was like, \u2018Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?\u2019 That was the main driving force: how bad things were.\u201d Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like \u201cYou Trip Me Up\u201d and \u201cNever Understand\u201d. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed. 10/35 26) Jeff Buckley \u2013 Grace (1994) Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cHallelujah\u201d, his melismatic singing on \u201cGrace\u201d and the church-like hush of \u201cLover, You Should Come Over\u201d \u2013 all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley\u2019s music will never fade. 11/35 25) Eminem \u2013 The Slim Shady LP (1999) The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem\u2019s major label debut was a breath of fresh air \u2013 or perhaps more of a slap in the face \u2013 after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called \u201ccharacter\u201d Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were. Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since. 12/35 24) The Who \u2013 My Generation (1965) Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them \u2013 but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who's my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965. 13/35 23) The Strokes \u2013 Is This It (2001) \u201cSaviours of rock and roll!\u201d \u201cThe greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!\u201d You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it\u2019s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music \u2013 critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn\u2019t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands. 14/35 22) Run-DMC \u2013 Run-DMC (1984) The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them \u201cthe first movie stars of rap\u2026 they are The Beatles\u201d. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: \u201cRun-DMC didn\u2019t change music, they changed everything.\u201d The trio\u2019s aggressive yet stark tracks \u2013 like \u201cSucker MCS\u201d and \u201cHard Times\u201d \u2013 were a dramatic contrast against the R&B-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, \u201cthey were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing\u201d. 15/35 21) Roxy Music \u2013 Roxy Music (1972) Brian Eno\u2019s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry\u2019s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music's bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (\u201c2HB\u201d) and cyber-rock jams (\u201cLadytron\u201d), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn\u2019t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno). 16/35 20) Jay-Z \u2013 Reasonable Doubt (1996) Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle \u2013 perhaps the best of his generation \u2013 recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist\u2019s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, \u201cBrooklyn\u2019s Finest\u201d, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East. 17/35 19) Black Sabbath \u2013 Black Sabbath (1970) Rolling Stone's Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as \u201cjust like Cream! But worse\u201d, and their debut album as \u201ca shuck \u2013 despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clich\u00e9s\u201d. The Village Voice weren\u2019t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as \u201cbulls**t necromancy.\u201d Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s piercing, operatic cry: \u201cMy name is Lucifer, please take my hand.\u201d Critics be damned. 18/35 18) Sex Pistols \u2013 Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols (1977) \u201cThe album will last. The sleeve may not,\u201d said the adverts for the Sex Pistols\u2019 first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history. 19/35 17) The Clash \u2013 The Clash (1977) Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn\u2019t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of \u201cCareer Opportunities\u201d and \u201cWhite Riot\u201d, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 20/35 16) Guns N Roses \u2013 Appetite for Destruction (1987) Guns N Roses' Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash\u2019s guitar and Axl Rose\u2019s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like \u201cParadise City\u201d and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time \u2013 proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. \u201cA lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,\u201d Rose said. Not this band. 21/35 15) Daft Punk \u2013 Homework (1996) Daft Punk's Homework was originally intended as \u201cjust a load of singles\u201d, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards \u2013 sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It\u2019s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene. 22/35 14) The Doors \u2013 The Doors (1967) Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you\u2019re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to divide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album\u2019s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman\u2019s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on \u201cLight My Fire\u201d proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200. 23/35 13) Kanye West \u2013 The College Dropout (2004) After making a name for himself on Jay-Z\u2019s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clich\u00e9s, skirting round the dominant \u201cgangsta\u201d persona and instead finding solace in family and the church. Def Jam 24/35 12) Pink Floyd \u2013 The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967) Pink Floyd\u2019s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett \u2013 ousted a year after the album\u2019s release \u2013 it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as \u201cBike\u201d, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 25/35 11) Lauryn Hill \u2013 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998) Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones \u2013 sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky \u2013 the former Fugees member stepped out from rap\u2019s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R&B, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D\u2019Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill\u2019s reggae influences are what drive the album\u2019s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it\u2019s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. 26/35 10) Dizzee Rascal \u2013 Boy in Da Corner (2003) It\u2019s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London\u2019s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track \u201cSittin\u2019 Here\u201d. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener\u2019s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. 27/35 9) Beastie Boys \u2013 Licensed to Ill (1986) Hip hop\u2019s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this \u2013 a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys' Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and \u201cgood time\u201d attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks. 28/35 8) The Notorious BIG \u2013 Ready to Die (1994) The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife\u2019s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was \u201cwaking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids; just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs\u201d, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die \u2013 one of the best debut albums in hip hop \u2013 delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour. 29/35 7) Ramones \u2013 Ramones (1976) At less than 30 minutes, Ramones\u2019 debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener\u2019s veins. It\u2019s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as \u201cBeat on the Brat\u201d and \u201cNow I Wanna Sniff Some Glue\u201d proving to be as surly as the band themselves. \u201cOur early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration \u2013 the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,\u201d singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make. 30/35 6) NWA \u2013 Straight Outta Compton NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren\u2019t positioning themselves as people to look up to: \u201cDo I look like a mother***ing role mode?\u201d he demands on \u201cGangsta Gangsta\u201d. Their track \u201cF*** tha Police\u201d \u2013 a protest track against racism and police brutality \u2013 led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame. 31/35 5) The Velvet Underground \u2013 The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967) Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground & Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico \u2013 the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol\u2019s request \u2013 you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from \u201cVenus in Furs\u201d to \u201cRun Run Run\u201d, but it\u2019s not so much glamour as glam rock \u2013 gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, \u201ceveryone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band\u201d. David Bowie called it \u201cthe future of music\u201d, and 52 years later, it still feels like it. 32/35 4) Jimi Hendrix Experience \u2013 Are You Experienced A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before \u2013 Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R&B, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That\u2019s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as \u201cPurple Haze\u201d. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on \u201cFoxy Lady\u201d. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by \u201cThe Wind Cries Mary\u201d. Hendrix\u2019s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time \u2013 yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. 33/35 3) Patti Smith \u2013 Horses (1975) \u201cJesus died for somebody\u2019s sins, but not mine,\u201d go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith\u2019s debut album Horses. There\u2019s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else\u2019s song (in this case Van Morrison\u2019s \u201cGloria\u201d), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. \u201cShe was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,\u201d Sonic Youth\u2019s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. \u201cIt was life-changing.\u201d 34/35 2) Illmatic \u2013 Nas (1994) How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music; not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around \u2013 Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor \u2013 was a move that Complex blamed for \u201cruining hip hop\u201d, while still praising Nas\u2019s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source\u2019s 1991 track \u201cLive at the BBQ\u201d: \u2018When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.\u201d 35/35 1) Joy Division \u2013 Unknown Pleasures (1979) Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it \u2013 or indeed any album since. It\u2019s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature; indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division's record's grooves make it feel \u201calmost Dostoevskyan\u201d. Peter Hook\u2019s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis\u2019s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On \u201cShe\u2019s Lost Control\u201d it as though you\u2019re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel \u2013 the echoes of Curtis's voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on \u201cI Remember Nothing\u201d, it doesn\u2019t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.\n\nHe applies this to his own audience, of which the make-up is almost entirely white. It threw him when he went to America for the first time, and it\u2019s something he still thinks about now \u2013 to the point he and his band were discussing it in the studio.\n\n\u201cI was like, what is that?\u201d he says. \u201cBecause everyone making my music is black.\u201d He thinks it could be a while before \u201cthe penny drops\u201d and his audience becomes more diverse. Circling back to how his schoolfriends all had their own instruments at home, he wonders if non-white fans are put off by the extravagant production and instrumentation of his own music: \u201cIt\u2019s expensive music to make,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re a rapper you can do it on a laptop and a mic. It\u2019s accessible \u2013 fans think, \u2018I could do that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is kind of controversial,\u201d he shrugs, \u201cbut I think when you come from oppression, for your skin colour, your sex... often you\u2019ve been beaten down so much that you do it to each other. You get so used to being low down that when you see someone rise above you, you want to drag them back down.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, Kiwanuka is a political album, one that samples civil-rights leaders such as John Lewis. The track \u201cHero\u201d is inspired by activist Fred Hampton, the 21-year-old leader of the Black Panthers\u2019 Illinois chapter who was murdered by police in 1969. But the album is not so much a call to arms as a series of quiet yet profound observations; it reminds you of the work of war poet Wilfred Owen, and other artists who felt compelled to document times of conflict.\n\n\u201cAll of these people have a way of speaking so powerfully,\u201d Kiwanuka says, citing the environmental activist Greta Thunberg as a present-day example. \u201cShe\u2019s so young! People assume young people are disengaged, that they\u2019re just playing Fortnite, but it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d There\u2019s a lyric in his song \u201cLight\u201d, he brings up: \u201cThe young and dumb will always need one of their own to lead.\u201d\n\nThe record is influenced by as broad a palette as The Rolling Stones, Gil Scott-Heron and Marvin Gaye, to the relatively unknown A$AP Rocky collaborator Joe Fox, who is recalled on the acoustic, reverb-drenched track \u201cHero\u201d. There\u2019s a real alchemy, too, when Kiwanuka gets together with Grammy award-winning producer Danger Mouse (The Black Keys, Gorillaz, Beck, A$AP Rocky, Adele) and the London-based Inflo, who worked with Little Simz on her 2019 masterpiece GREY Area. Both producers, says Kiwanuka, have a deep understanding of his aversion to being pigeonholed. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many young black producers who do this kind of music, so Inflo\u2019s fighting for that. We definitely met at the right time.\u201d\n\nHe also credits Inflo with his increased willingness to appear in his own music videos, having previously felt self-conscious about his image. Fans will have seen him recently in the visuals for \u201cYou Ain\u2019t the Problem\u201d, cameoing with Ed Sheeran in Danny Boyle\u2019s film Yesterday, and with south London producer-musician wunderkind Tom Misch, in the video for their buoyant, funk-influenced track \u201cMoney\u201d. Neither Kiwanuka nor Misch can drive, so they ended up being towed around the California desert in a series of luxury cars.\n\n\u201cI was really nervous, terrified actually, of making that video,\u201d Kiwanuka says. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s a good sign, because it means you\u2019re pushing yourself.\u201d He recalls Inflo telling him how important it is for fans to see the artist they\u2019re listening to: \u201cIt helps them connect.\u201d\n\nAs our interview comes to an end, I mention how this seems like a radical step-up for an artist who, while never accused of playing it safe, has equally never been hailed for breaking new ground. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a big move for me,\u201d he says of the album, \u201cbut I think it was the right time. You get to an age, particularly first-generation black men, where you redefine or reacquaint yourself with your background, and I think that\u2019s been affecting art as well. Sometimes you\u2019ve got to be vulnerable \u2013 even if it\u2019s not easy.\u201d\n\nKiwanuka is out on 1 November", "description": "Michael Kiwanuka\u2019s house is falling down. Or rather, the wall of his front garden is. The 32-year-old artist recently moved from his long-time home in Muswell Hill, north London, to Southampton.
