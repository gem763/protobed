That\u2019s generally the model or process for everyone, not just Mark and Joe.\u201d\n\nJamie George has revealed he has been preparing for the humidity in Japan by dipping balls in buckets of water before throwing into the lineout during training.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing it for a while now, but we have buckets on the side of the pitch and we put the ball in that before we throw it,\u201d the England hooker said. \u201cWe\u2019re the lucky ones because we get a towel before we throw, so we\u2019re at least allowed to dab it down a bit. We saw it in training yesterday \u2013 the ball is slippery.\n\n\u201cWe might not have the benefit of a towel each time, so we make sure we don\u2019t use towels too much in training. It\u2019s obviously beneficial if we get a towel in a game. It doesn\u2019t make too much of a difference to us as lineout throwers. You just have to make sure you grip it and hope for the best.\u201d\n\nRitchie to miss Scotland\u2019s opener with Ireland\n\nFlanker Jamie Ritchie is set to miss Scotland\u2019s World Cup opener with Ireland, but Gregor Townsend says he is glad not to be dealing with a more serious casualty list.\n\nEdinburgh forward Ritchie suffered a broken cheekbone against Georgia at Murrayfield last week. He underwent surgery to have a titanium plate fitted before flying out to Japan, and is expected to be fit for Scotland\u2019s second game, against Samoa.\n\n\u201c[Jamie] is still recovering from the operation and also jet lag, so he\u2019s not training with us just yet,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cHe\u2019s unlikely to be available for the Ireland game but he will be back in full training after that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had four players who went to hospital [after the Georgia game] and two who had to be removed because of head injuries. But all of them are available to play in the World Cup,\u201d Townsend added. \u201cThat means we\u2019re in the best possible condition to play well.\u201d\n\n\u2018Preparation is everything\u2019: the real Eddie Jones\u2019s hard road to Japan Read more\n\nWales are set to be without locks Adam Beard and Cory Hill for their World Cup opener against Georgia on 23 September. Ospreys forward Beard will fly out to Japan on Thursday after staying behind in Wales to haved his appendix removed.\n\nHill is continuing his recovery from a stress fracture in his leg, and is on target to be available against Australia six days later, while fly-half Rhys Patchell has resumed non-contact training after suffering a concussion in the warm-up against Ireland.\n\n\u201cWe will ease [Rhys] back into contact work later in the week, making sure that we go through the protocols and ensure he\u2019s 100% and available for selection,\u201d said the Wales head coach, Warren Gatland.
