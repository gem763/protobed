His image was further damaged when his government was found to have pushed for judicial leniency for SNC-Lavalin, a scandal-plagued engineering firm based in the politically crucial province of Quebec.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s personal reputation suffered another blow when pictures emerged of him in blackface \u2013 and suffered again when he couldn\u2019t say how often he\u2019d donned it in public. Though he repeatedly apologised, the incident played into the well-hewed caricature of Trudeau as a hypocritical, out-of-touch dilettante.\n\nYet in defeating Conservative party, the Liberals have instead called into question the direction of conservativism in Canada. The Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, himself a social conservative, was decidedly uncomfortable discussing issues of abortion, same sex marriage and climate change.\n\nThough Scheer\u2019s plan to scrap Trudeau\u2019s carbon tax was popular in Canada\u2019s oil-producing regions, it put him at odds with public opinion across the country. As a result, the party failed to gain momentum in either Quebec or the vote-rich confines of suburban Ontario.\n\nAnd the election was also a veritable death knell for the country\u2019s fledging far right party, the People\u2019s Party of Canada. Its leader, former Conservative MP Maxime Bernier, adopted the tone and substance of Trumpian nativism, decrying multiculturalism and promising to decrease immigration. Formed just over a year ago, the PPC ran a nearly full slate of candidates, yet failed to win a single seat.\n\nTrudeau will instead look to his left to prop up his minority government. With just over two dozen seats, the New Democratic Party will likely hold the balance of power in Parliament.\n\nNDP leader Jagmeet Singh, a practising Sikh, is the first person of colour to lead a federal political party in Canada\u2019s history. The NDP platform is chock full of progressive initiatives, including a national pharmacare plan and a tax on the ultra-rich to help pay for it.\n\nThe party is also firmly against further pipeline development, which puts it at odds with the Liberal plan to expand the Trans Mountain Pipeline. However, the NDP\u2019s newfound power \u2013 the party has never formed a government \u2013 is tempered by its empty coffers and Canada\u2019s election fatigue, meaning expediency will likely trump ideology in the short and medium term.\n\nThe Liberal party lost a significant number of votes and seats in the election. Trudeau\u2019s reputation as Canada\u2019s \u201cSweet Woke Bae Prince\u201d is damaged, perhaps permanently, because of his onetime penchant painting his face black. Yet in winning the election despite it all, Justin Trudeau has again turned the focus on his right-leaning rivals across the aisle.", "description": "Canada\u2019s 43rd election campaign capped a particularly bruising year for Trudeau, but in the end his right-leaning rivals fared worse", "authors": ["Martin Patriquin", "Moustafa Bayoumi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/731704d2c6980fb21df29c31ae4212fef0409095/0_111_4891_2937/master/4891.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7694af474a21d4288b6708e5b06d24c3", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
