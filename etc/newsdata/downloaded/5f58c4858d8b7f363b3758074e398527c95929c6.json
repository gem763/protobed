She unabashedly shows her bald head, cane and insight into her everyday pain with the world. She\u2019s been called an \u201cinspiration,\u201d \u201cstunning\u201d and \u201cbeautiful,\u201d but since her diagnosis, it seems we\u2019ve dropped the word \u201csexy\u201d to describe her.\n\nThis is no accident. Our culture often disassociates disabled women with desirability, sex, love and dating. We see disabled men portrayed as having a love life more often in the media than disabled women, like in \u201cMe Before You.\u201d So when we describe Selma Blair as \u201cinspirational\u201d and \u201cbeautiful\u201d but not \u201csexy,\u201d we\u2019re unknowingly perpetuating the marginalization of disabled women.\n\nSelma knows she is sexy and sultry, as evidenced by her almost naked Instagram post from September 7, in which she poses with full butt exposure and just a purse over her front. Selma shows us she is still sensual and risqu\u00e9. Yes, she\u2019s an inspiration in her activism and yes, she is beautiful, but she\u2019s also sexy.\n\nRelated:\u200b What the Middle of a Pain Flare Is Really Like\n\nBut so what if we don\u2019t use \u201csexy\u201d to describe Selma? Well, there are definitely larger implications to this narrative of desexualized disabled women.\n\nLack of Access to Contraceptives, Sexual Health and Education\n\nYouTube duo the \u201cTriple Cripples,\u201d Olajumoke \u201cJay\u201d Abdullahi and Kym Oliver talk about this intersection of sex and disability on their show. They\u2019ve named themselves the \u201cTriple Cripples\u201d to convey the three layers of oppression they face because they are black, disabled and women. Jay and Kym highlight this when they say on their channel, \u201cThe infantilization of disabled people means we are not shown or thought of as being potential love interests, or as people that could get someone sexually excited.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s so dehumanizing to be treated like this. But it\u2019s also dangerous.\n\nRelated:\u200b When I'm Accused of 'Playing the Multiple Sclerosis Card'\n\nDisabled women often aren\u2019t given equal access to sex education and contraceptives because of this idea that disabled women are not sexual. Billie Anderson, who has an ostomy bag, talks about when she first got surgery to have her bag, nurses never mentioned anything about sexual health or just having sex with a bag.\n\nThe Triple Cripples teamed up with SH:24 \u2013 an NHS-backed organization that provides free sexual health home testing kits and resources \u2014 to help address this problem.\n\nDamage to Self-Confidence\n\nAs Lolly Cooper says, \u201cOver the years Crohn\u2019s disease has had a great impact on the way my body looks and functions\u2026 this has inevitably had a lasting effect on my self-confidence and my relationship with my body.\u201d Taking away the power that comes with sexuality also damages body image and self-confidence. We all deserve to feel beautiful and stunning, but also desirable, and those feelings go hand in hand with our self-confidence.\n\nRelated:\u200b How Developing Multiple Sclerosis Saved My Life\n\nDehumanizing Shopping Experiences\n\nThis narrative that disabled women aren\u2019t sexual has impacted the fashion industry. Clothing brands like Tommy Hilfiger and Zappos are just starting to release \u201cadaptive apparel\u201d lines (adaptive apparel means clothing for disabled folk that is versatile and not just for able-bodied folk). But for generations, disabled women had nowhere to shop. Shopping in our culture is tied closely to the feminine identity. Good shopping experiences can help define a woman\u2019s femininity, personal identity and self-assurance.\n\nThe undergarment and lingerie sector of the shopping experience has been especially dehumanizing for disabled women. Bras and underwear for disabled women have looked like \u201cgrandma\u201d underwear and are found on ugly medicinal websites. Can you imagine how humiliating it must be to buy your bra next to a hospital gown? Lingerie and undergarments should be empowering.\n\nThis sector is also slowly changing with companies like Intimately.co, an online marketplace for all types of functional and fashionable lingerie and undergarments for disabled women. Their goal is to change this narrative of disabled women not being sexual through a better shopping experience.", "description": "Emma Butler explains why recognizing that Selma Blair and other women with disabilities are sexy is an important part of ending stereotypes about disability and sexuality.", "authors": ["Emma Butler"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/d4yg9u.6K24HJKKBsWFvhQ--~B/aD0yMTM7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_mighty_beauty_225/969c35392676b618c9f011a228fbbeb5", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
