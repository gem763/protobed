Apple Insider spotted the news in a meeting summary, which indicates Cook will assume the role for the next three years. He recently even acted as chairman for a meeting of the board\n\nNow, it's not so surprising Cook was offered the position, given that he's been on the board in the past, as has Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg. What is surprising though is that Cook would accept the position, given China's current role in the violent clamping down of protesters in Hong Kong, not to mention their shady surveillance and censorship practices in general.\n\nDon't Miss 4.8 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES 685 SHARES 724 SHARES\n\nCook was already facing criticism for Apple's recent decision to remove an app called HKmap.liv from its App Store. Designed to warn people in Hong Kong about where protests were occurring and police were gathering, Apple first rejected it outright. After eventually accepting it onto the App Store, they then took it down in a couple of days, claiming it was being used to threaten the safety of locals. Yet the \"reliable reports\" the company cited as influencing this decision were only carried by state-backed Chinese publications, not free publications.\n\nThat itself was a bad move for Apple to make. Now, Cook's acceptance of the position at the economics school in Beijing is a clear announcement of what was previously only implied. It's a tacit approval of the Chinese government from a major international corporation, and an indication that many of them will look the other way so they can keep reaping the benefits of Chinese money.", "description": "Apple hasn\u2019t been doing so well lately in the civic responsibility department.
