It seems such a small, gentle thing to demand in 2019 but it has actually become the biggest ask that we can make.\u201d\n\nMaitlis said it was of course a key part of her job to elicit truthful answers from politicians but proved increasingly difficult.\n\n\u201cWhat I notice now is that a lot of the things that are said to us on camera, on air, are not particularly believed and quite often not true. It is an extraordinary position to be in. It is a really weird position to be in as a journalist.\u201d\n\nEmily Maitlis: \u2018I\u2019ve ended up in prison a number of times\u2019 Read more\n\nShe gave as an example a politician telling her there was absolutely no doubt that Theresa May would get her Brexit deal through and then, off air, they casually admitted they would lose by about 80 votes.\n\n\u201cYou just think, wow, that was three seconds, that was three seconds later!\u201d\n\nMaitlis said there was a real climate of politicians infantilising language, thinking that three words would shut down debate.\n\n\u201cIt is a way of saying if you question something, you\u2019re not an optimist \u2026 you\u2019re being a bit negative or you\u2019re not patriotic.\u201d\n\nThat could be on any political side, she said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s \u2018Get Brexit done\u2019\u201d or \u2018People before privilege\u2019.\u201d\n\nMaitlis was announced as the new lead presenter of Newsnight in March and is grateful that viewers seem decreasingly interested in what she wears on screen.\n\nThat may change, though. The show got a recent relaunch and now has fuchsia sofas. It means she can now probably wear only black, navy or white. \u201cMy life has become incredibly simple since the relaunch because you don\u2019t want to clash with a fuchsia sofa,\u201d she said.", "description": "Presenter tells of politicians who admit they don\u2019t believe their own replies and others who shut down debate in three words", "authors": ["Mark Brown"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7661432faa35b65a0a534f27c46b5d6450842032/0_118_4730_2838/master/4730.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=092c2f3aded72f90862a208c42cae31d", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
