All proceeds will go to the North Liverpool Foodbank.\n\nSpirit of Shankly said: \u201cThere is no national train service running on this day and local public transport is likely to be severely reduced \u2013 if operating at all by the time of the game finishing. Both sets of supporters will encounter difficulty getting to and from the stadium.\n\n\u201cA consequence of such a disdainful, zero-consideration change means LFC\u2019s following fixture, at home to Wolves, is also to be moved to Sunday 29 December, again with inconvenience and negative implications for fans and workers.\n\nQuick guide Premier League TV schedule for December 2019 Show Hide (all times GMT) Tuesday 3 December\n\n7.30pm Crystal Palace v Bournemouth (Amazon Prime Sport) 8.15pm Burnley v Man City (Amazon Prime Sport) Wednesday 4 December 7.30pm Chelsea v Aston Villa (Amazon Prime Sport) 7.30pm Leicester v Watford (Amazon Prime Sport) 7.30pm Man Utd v Spurs (Amazon Prime Sport) 7.30pm Southampton v Norwich (Amazon Prime Sport) 7.30pm Wolves v West Ham (Amazon Prime Sport) 8.15pm Liverpool v Everton (Amazon Prime Sport) Thursday 5 December 7.30pm Sheff Utd v Newcastle (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\n8.15pm Arsenal v Brighton (Amazon Prime Sport) Saturday 7 December 12:30pm Everton v Chelsea (BT Sport) 5.30pm Man City v Man Utd (Sky Sports) Sunday 8 December 2pm Aston Villa v Leicester (Sky Sports)\n\n4.30pm Brighton v Wolves (Sky Sports) Monday 9 December 2019 8pm West Ham v Arsenal (Sky Sports) Saturday 14 December 12:30pm Liverpool v Watford (BT Sport) 5.30pm Southampton v West Ham (Sky Sports) Sunday 15 December 2pm Man Utd v Everton (Sky Sports)\n\n4.30pm Arsenal v Man City (Sky Sports) Monday 16 December 8pm Crystal Palace v Brighton (Sky Sports) Saturday 21 December 12.30pm Everton v Arsenal (BT Sport)\n\n5.30pm Man City v Leicester (Sky Sports) Sunday 22 December 2pm Watford v Man Utd (Sky Sports) 4.30pm Spurs v Chelsea (Sky Sports) Thursday 26 December 12.30pm Spurs v Brighton (Amazon Prime Sport) 3pm Bournemouth v Arsenal (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\n3pm Aston Villa v Norwich (Amazon Prime Sport) 3pm Chelsea v Southampton (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\n3pm Crystal Palace v West Ham (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\n3pm Everton v Burnley (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\n3pm Sheff Utd v Watford (Amazon Prime Sport) 5.30pm Man Utd v Newcastle (Amazon Prime Sport) 8pm Leicester v Liverpool (Amazon Prime Sport) Friday 27 December 7.45pm Wolves v Manchester City (Amazon Prime Sport)\n\n\u201cThe Premier League and TV companies repeatedly ignore the welfare of supporters.
