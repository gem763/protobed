Blood can't flow as well through this tough tissue and the liver's ability to process the toxins and nutrients pumped through it starts to degrade.\n\nOnce cirrhosis sets in, there's never been anything doctors can do to force healthy liver tissue back in where scar tissue has taken over, short of a full-organ transplant.\n\nA nearly identical process happens in the progression of lung disease, though it's called fibrosis rather than cirrhosis.\n\nThe scar tissue is stiffer than than the strong but pliable tissue that makes up healthy lungs, so fibrosis sufferers struggle to breathe properly and often cough and wheeze.\n\nLung and liver diseases' progression of damage and scarring is familiar and well understood by scientists, but the details of the development of these diseases are still a subject of burgeoning research.\n\nIn recent years, scientists discovered two proteins that seemed to switch on certain genes which then in turn send instructions to the lungs or liver that tell tissue scarring to set in.\n\nThe two proteins, YAP and TAZ, are involved in other diseases, most notably, cancer.\n\nBut they're also crucial in the 'social dynamics' of how various cells communicate with one another as well as the the way wounds heal and even such basic regulatory functions as making sure a cell keeps its size.\n\nSo despite the fact that YAP and TAZ make tempting targets for stopping both tumor growth and the development of fibroblasts, scientists couldn't simply block them off without disrupting a whole cascade of other essential biological processes.\n\nBut the Mayo Clinic team wanted to look more closely at the fibroblasts themselves to find a way to block YAP and TAZ in isolation.\n\nAnd, as they new study reveals, they found it: dopamine.\n\nFibroblasts specifically in the lungs and liver, they found, have a receptor for dopamine, the same neurotransmitter that allows us to feel pleasure and pain.\n\n'Dopamine is mostly studied in disorders of the central nervous system, and we were surprised to find dopamine receptors expressed in fibroblasts,' said lead study author Dr Daniel Tschumerlin.\n\nStimulating the dopamine receptors in the fibroblasts did something rather remarkable to the scar tissue precursors.\n\nIt made them switch modes. So, if YAP and TAZ put the destructive vehicle that is fibrosis in 'drive,' adding dopamine to the equation puts it in 'reverse,' stopping the formation of scar tissue and even reversing it in mice and petri dish samples.\n\n'In addition to following up on regulation of dopamine signaling in the lung, we are actively developing novel molecules to target the dopamine receptor, as we think there is substantial promise in trying to translate this approach to human diseases,' said Dr Tshumerlin.\n\nAbout 100,000 people in the US suffer irreversible pulmonary fibrisos and another 30,000 to 40,000 people are diagnosed annually.\n\nOne in 400 US adults have liver cirrhosis that will only get worse with time.\n\nBut if the Mayo Clinic research suggests that, if the same process is safe in humans, someday recovery might be possible.", "description": "Mayo Clinic researchers have discovered a way to block two proteins to reverse the processes that drive liver and lung diseases so that the body actually breaks down the harmful scar tissue.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/22/20398394-0-image-a-3_1572473657436.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
