Instead of concentrating on my aches and pains I just know I have to read this set of briefs, draft opinions. So I have to surmount whatever is going on in my body and concentrate on the court\u2019s work.\u201d", "description": "The Supreme Court justice recently finshed treatment for pancreatic cancer and plans to head back to work soon.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6ac1da240000330071c351.jpeg?cache=a76z855tcs&ops=1778_1000"}
