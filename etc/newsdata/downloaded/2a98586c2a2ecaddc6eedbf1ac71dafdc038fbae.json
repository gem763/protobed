Morris turned toward the rim and faced up with Anderson. He pulled the ball up as Anderson moved in closer.\n\nMorris quickly swung his left and right elbows, nearly hitting Anderson in the face. Anderson was shocked by the move and looked at a nearby referee for a foul call, but didn\u2019t hear a whistle.\n\nMorris then lifted the ball over his head before bringing it down on top of Anderson\u2019s head. Referees called a flagrant type 2 foul on Morris and ejected the Knicks forward. Morris and Anderson exchanged words before Morris walked off the court. Anderson made one of his two free throws as a result of the infraction.\n\n\u201cI mean that\u2019s Marcus Morris,\u201d Knicks coach David Fizdale said. \u201cOur team will embody his spirit. Obviously, he understands that you can\u2019t be a detriment of us. He didn\u2019t want to hurt the kid. At the same time, he does have an edge to him and we want to keep that edge.\u201d\n\nMorris could be suspended for the incident.\n\n\u201cMy team needs me. I\u2019ve got to be smart, set a better example,\u201d Morris said. \u201cBut like I said in the beginning, we\u2019re not taking any [expletive]. So it is what it is.\u201d\n\nAnderson had nine points in the win. Morris had 17 points and seven rebounds in 18 minutes for the Knicks. Rookie R.J. Barrett also recorded 17 points to lead the Knicks. Moritz Wagner scored 16 points off the bench to lead the Wizards.\n\nThe Knicks host the Wizards in another preseason game at 7:30 p.m. EDT Friday at Madison Square Garden in New York City.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 New York Knicks forward Marcus Morris was kicked out of a preseason game against the Washington Wizards after swinging his elbows at", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
