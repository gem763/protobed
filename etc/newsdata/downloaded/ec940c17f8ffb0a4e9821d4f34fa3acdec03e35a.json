As an undervalued growth company, Amex fit our investment process.\n\nIt has a solid industry position, high quality management team, strong earnings growth potential and we saw a valuation disconnect given these factors at the time we invested in the company. The catalyst was the potential for earnings beats, which we have seen over multiple quarters.\n\nWe are passionate about investing in small-to mid-cap companies and our process naturally gravitates to them as their growth potential is often higher. However, if a larger company rates using our process then we will buy it.\n\nWhat's the best advice you've ever been given from an investment mentor?\n\nAvoiding the losers can be as important as picking the winners. Obviously we all make investing mistakes but minimising the blow ups can add significantly to investment returns achieved overtime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, bad balance sheets significantly reduce optionality, so avoid them.\n\nAs a global investor, do you place much faith in trying to anticipate market rotations?\n\nWe are picking individual stocks that fit our investment process, so we are less focused on trying to anticipate market rotations, but consistently monitor market positioning.\n\nWe're always looking for new TV shows to stream. What's caught your eye?\n\nI\u2019m just back from a work trip and watched a couple of Netflix shows while travelling: Inside Bill\u2019s Brain and Sour Grapes.\n\nFinally, a recommendation for the readers on a good value quick bite in Sydney?\n\nKitchen by Mike is an office favourite \u2013 the menu is always changing, it's good value and reasonably healthy, if you stay away from the desserts!", "description": "AFR Markets Live checks in with Wilson Asset Management's Catriona Burns on Bandai Namco and why she likes Amex.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.267%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_175%2C$y_19/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0a5066f83dabc64124667b3b394deae13ff28852", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
