Dating back to the 1800\u2019s, influential scientists, including Charles Darwin and Gustave Le Bon, believed women were \u201cbiologically inferior to men.\u201d Gustave Le Bon, a social psychologist best known for his study of the psychological characteristics of crowds, even went as far to say: \u201cWomen represent the most inferior forms of human evolution and are closer to children and savages than to an adult, civilized, man.\u201d\n\nThese \u201cantiquated\u201d beliefs didn\u2019t stay in the 18th century. Just last year, an engineer from Google published a whole manifesto detailing the various ways women were biologically different from men, and urged Google to have an \u201chonest discussion about the costs and benefits of our diversity programs.\u201d\n\nBut Gina Rippon, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at the Aston Brain Center in Birmingham, UK and the author of The Gendered Brain, believes any scientist trying to find innate and biological brain differences between the genders will come up short \u2014 her research reveals brains reflect the life they\u2019ve lived, not the biological sex of their owners.\n\n\u201cDarwin was one of the world\u2019s greatest scientists and also a pretty profound misogynist. Beliefs like his still exist, particularly in science. It\u2019s a political activist area I pursue in parallel with my research looking at the causes of the underrepresentation of women in science,\u201d Rippon told TNW. \u201cThe culture of science still very much emphasizes the idea that a scientist is a man, the genius scientist is almost definitely a man, and women are constitutionally unsuited for science \u2014 maybe even cognitively unsuited.\u201d\n\nRippon focuses her research on the connection between the brain and behavior to understand more about cognitive disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. In the 1990s, Rippon started researching the differences between male and female brains and found an enormous lack of consistency in scientific research \u2014 and ever since, she\u2019s stuck with it.\n\nThe \u2018size matters\u2019 issue is past its sell-by date\n\nThe most cited research which scientists still fall back on today is the finding that, on average, men\u2019s brains are 10 percent bigger than women\u2019s. \u201cThe \u2018size matters\u2019 issue was where it all started,\u201d Rippon said. \u201cTowards the end of the 18th century, there was an emerging understanding of how important the brain was in explaining behavior. Scientists at the time looked at society and said, \u2018Well, women are clearly inferior to men, they have little brains\u2019 \u2014 and they said it exactly like that.\u201d\n\nHowever, research has proven a bigger brain doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee a more successful or intelligent individual. Sperm whales and elephants have massive brains, but their intelligence isn\u2019t greater than humans.\n\n\u201cScientists rapidly had to rethink what they were talking about. But they kept tweaking the measures they were taking to ensure they always found that white, upper class, educated men were at the top of the scale.\u201d\n\nMore recently, a study by the UK Biobank found that many regions of men\u2019s brains were larger than women\u2019s, and that women on average had thicker cerebral cortices. However, it\u2019s unclear if this has any affect on how the brain works. Another study found that \u201caveraged across many people, sex differences in brain structure do exist, but an individual brain is likely to be just that: individual, with a mix of features.\u201d\n\nIn the The Gendered Brain, Rippon challenges the idea that there are specific male and female brains, and offers a 21st-century model for better understanding of how brains get to be different. This involves understanding how brains can be affected by the lives they live, the experiences and opportunities they have, the culture around them, and the stereotypes that set boundaries.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of gender bombardment and marketing that pointlessly applies gender to products like shower gel, toys, books, and clothes. Stereotyping and emphasis on the difference between boys and girls starts really, really early in life,\u201d Rippon said. \u201cFor example, gender reveal parties encourage people to think about the gender of a child 20 weeks before it\u2019s even been born.\u201d\n\nPushback from the transgender community\n\nAlthough Rippon\u2019s research provides a modern look on gendered myths, her research has recieved pushback from some people in the transgender community. Researchers, including psychiatrist Murat Altinay, MD, are trying to understand where gender originates and where is exists in the body. In a Cleveland Clinic article, which explores research into the \u201ctransgender brain,\u201d Dr. Altinay explained: \u201cGender is not only in our genitalia; there\u2019s something in the brain that determines gender.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been pushback from some transgender communities who feel like there\u2019s an inextricable link between your biological sex and your social gender,\u201d Rippon explained. \u201cTherefore, if you feel a disconnect between the biological sex you were assigned at birth, and the gender identity that you feel is yours, the rationale for transitioning is that you have a female brain in a male body or a male brain in a female body.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, when I come along and say there\u2019s no such thing as a female brain, it undermines the argument they\u2019re trying to make.\u201d\n\nRippon ultimately argues that brain difference is down to the individual. For decades, science has tried to prove the possible difference between men and women in regards to intellectual capabilities. But, if you step back, look at the issues and stereotypes holding women back, there are centuries of sexist beliefs that need to be unraveled before we reach true gender equality, and the gendered brain is a good first step.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how powerful stereotypes are. They don\u2019t realize gendered products, for example, are an end product to a very, very long chain of gendered expectations in society.\u201d", "description": "Neuroscientist Gina Rippon believes any scientist trying to find innate and biological brain differences between the genders will come up short.", "authors": ["Cara Curtis"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FGR.png&signature=10f6238ef317868aaf56af6c8a229c99", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
