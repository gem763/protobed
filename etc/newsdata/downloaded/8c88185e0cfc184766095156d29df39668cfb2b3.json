Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.\n\nAnd while big businesses have underpaid by \u00a37.7bn, up from \u00a37.2bn last year, income from small businesses, which make up the majority of the British economy, is short by \u00a314bn, up from \u00a312.3bn last year.\n\nThe VAT tax gap is now \u00a312.5bn, up 13 per cent in a year. That means almost 10p in every pound is missing from this type of revenue alone.\n\nAt the same time, the self-assessment tax gap is now 17 per cent of expected revenue. Up by 10 per cent in the last year, people completing a self-assessment tax return are underpaying their dues by \u00a37.4bn a year.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t include the so-called hidden economy. \u201cGhosts\u201d who don\u2019t declare any of their income to HMRC and \u201cmoonlighters\u201d who only own up to some of it now cost the economy \u00a31.9bn a year.\n\nIn fact, HMRC collected more than 94 per cent of all the taxes due for the 2017-18 year. But with a recent emphasis on tightening up and resources being thrown at making sure the right taxes are paid by the right people, the \u00a32bn increase in the amount of tax being lost every year has got to grate.\n\n\u201cHMRC and the Treasury are going to be disappointed with this performance,\u201d says Jason Collins, head of tax for law firm Pinsent Masons.\n\n\u201cHMRC is now a very driven organisation so the idea that there is \u00a335bn in underpaid tax and over \u00a310bn in underpaid tax through evasion and other criminal behaviour is going to be a trigger for much more investigatory activity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe increase in the gap is surprising given the tools, powers and money HMRC has been given in recent times, and no doubt there will be a clamour for them to be given more.\u201d\n\nSo should we all start worrying that an error on our tax returns will mean an imminent strong-armed knock on the door?\n\nProbably not.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate that VAT and corporation tax will be big targets as the tax gaps here have seen major increases in value,\u201d adds Collins. \u201cThe yields from investigating bigger businesses will also help drive HMRC\u2019s activity. The return on investment from opening an investigation into a large or midmarket company is much greater than opening an investigation to microbusiness.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear from a closer look at the figures that one of the biggest problems isn\u2019t dodgy dealers of every size trying to hoodwink HMRC. For most of us mere mortals, it\u2019s the complexity of the system hampering those who just want to pay what they owe and not live in fear of an expensive and time-consuming audit.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the most common reason for tax not being paid is simply down to people failing to take reasonable care likely illustrates a system in need of simplification,\u201d says Rachael Griffin, tax and financial planning specialist at Quilter, who adds that the government is currently paying a premium of \u00a36.4bn every year for its overly complex tax system.\n\n\u201cThe achievement is also further eroded by the fact that the government posted the exact same tax gap of 5.6 per cent in 2011 showing that over a number of years HMRC are still unable to plug some of the holes contributing to this issue.\n\nAnd while celebrity tax avoidance schemes are typically high up the press agenda, in reality they are one of the smallest contributors to the tax gap.\n\n\u201cThese figures paint a picture of a public very happy to pay tax but are simply making avoidable errors due to the fact they can\u2019t navigate what is a very complex system,\u201d adds Griffin.\n\n\u201cNew schemes such as Making Tax Digital should help to streamline the process and make sure that people pay the tax they owe and avoid unintended errors. Making sure all members of society pay tax is an essential part of our system.\n\n\u201cFixing the nation\u2019s taxation system is going to become increasingly important in the uncertain political landscape we now find ourselves in, and in harder fiscal times harsher penalties are sometimes applied,\u201d she warns.", "description": "The amount of money heading to the UK\u2019s national coffers from taxes is coming up short.
