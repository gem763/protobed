The festival hit a half-tonne at previous years, and in 2019 it\u2019s going for the whole-ass tonne.\n\nA tonne of cheese, I can\u2019t even fathom that in my tiny mind. It\u2019s enough to power cheesemares for a lifetime, I reckon.\n\nOh, and it\u2019s all free to pick at. Go for your life, just go hog-wild on that cheese table.\n\nAs much as it sounds like a chance to stuff as much fancy-ass fromage into your gob, it\u2019s not all that\u2019s set to happen at the cheese festival. No whey.\n\nWorld-renowned French cheesemonger Francois Robin will be running masterclasses (with tastings, obv), there will be cooking demonstrations and cheese workshops, as well as specially-made cheese-heavy dishes from the kitchens of BL Burger, KOI Dessert Bar, and Loluk Bistro.\n\nThe festival will also have a wine and gin bar up and running, so you can pair your nibblies to a nice tipple, or take a bottle home to go with your next cheeseboard.\n\nPlus you\u2019ll be able to take some delish cheesy boys home from local Aussie artisanal fromageries and provedores. This cheese festival truly sounds like what I imagine food heaven to look like.\n\nThe Bon Fromage cheese festival lands at Carriageworks on October 18-20 and is entirely free to get into, the only catch is that you have to register for a session, which is a pretty bloody good deal to me.\n\nCorral the group chat now because I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll sell out quicker than you can say \u201cBleu d\u2019Auvergne.\u201d", "description": "The curd-heavy Bon Fromage cheese festival is returning to Sydney's Carriageworks in October, this time bringing an actual tonne of cheese to the table.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/bon-fromage-festival-fb.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
