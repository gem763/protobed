Furious Labour MPs have blasted the bid as a \u201cridiculous stunt\u201d.\n\nBut despite Labour\u2019s fury and initial Tory brush-offs the fresh election bid appeared to be gathering momentum.\n\nThe Government still has the option of leaving the EU earlier - at the end of November or December - if MPs and the European Parliament pass a withdrawal agreement before then.\n\nThe development is damaging for the PM who repeatedly promised he would not ask for a delay to Brexit - claiming he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than fail to leave on October 31st. Tory MPs are also worried about the threat they face from the Brexit party at a general election", "description": "MPs rejected the PMs bid to call an election under the Fixed Term Parliament Act, after Labour said the Prime Minister's word couldn't be trusted", "authors": ["Pippa Crerar", "Nicola Bartlett", "Image", "Andy Rain Epa-Efe Rex", "Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20744835.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_British-Prime-Minister-Boris-Johnson-awaits-vote-on-his-general-election-motion-London-United-King.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
