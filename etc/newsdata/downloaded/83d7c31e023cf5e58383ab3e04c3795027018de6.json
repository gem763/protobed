The next day, she felt better and decided to go into work, when tragedy struck.\n\nMichael received a phone call from one of his wife\u2019s colleagues, who told him to come and pick her up. Four days later, doctors told Michael and Saima\u2019s family that they would need to make a decision on whether to turn off the machines that were keeping Saima alive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer condition had worsened, and they were unable to find a heartbeat.\n\n\u2018I gave her a kiss and told her I loved her and that I\u2019d make her proud,\u2019 Michael said.\n\n\u2018Saima was everything to me and now she\u2019d gone.\u2019\n\nMichael has now decided to open up about what happened to his late wife, in an effort to cherish her memory and raise awareness of the illness that caused her death.\n\nThe 29-year-old buried his wife in her wedding dress in December last year.\n\n\u2018She was buried in her wedding dress, which she\u2019d always said she wanted to wear again one day,\u2019 Michael said.\n\nAccording to the NHS, it\u2019s not always clear what causes encephalitis, but it can be due to viral infections, an issue with the immune system \u2013 which causes the body\u2019s defence system to attack the brain \u2013 or bacterial and fungal infections.\n\nIt usually presents itself with cold and flu symptoms, but can also include seizures, speaking difficulties and changes in personality or behaviour, among other symptoms.\n\nThe couple met through the dating app Plenty of Fish (Picture: PA Real Life/Collect)\n\nThe couple started chatting through the dating app Plenty of Fish, and reminiscing of their past, Michael said he was sure he\u2019d met his \u2018soulmate\u2019.\n\nOn their first date, they got so caught up in talking that they missed their dinner reservation, and date two followed days later.\n\nThe following year, in September 2016, they took a trip to Thailand together, where Michael got down on one knee and popped the question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It may have seemed quick, but there was no doubt in my mind I had found my soulmate,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Saima was my best friend. She was so elegant \u2013 the softest, nicest person you could ever meet.\n\n\u2018We loved travelling, going out to restaurants, seeing our circle of friends \u2013 just enjoying and building our life together.\n\n\u2018So, after a year together, I took her to Thailand on a surprise holiday. We had a private beach with our own photographer, and that\u2019s where I proposed with a ring I had designed myself.\u2019\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time tragedy has truck in Michael\u2019s life.\n\nThe widower lost his mum Jane, 37 and his brother Ben, nine, in a car accident when he was 12 years old, in December 2002 when on holiday in South Africa. Michael and his dad survived the crash.\n\nIt made Michael hesitant to \u2018letting\u2019 people into his heart, but all that changed when he met Saima.\n\n\u2018Growing up, I had been unsure about relationships and letting somebody in,\u2019 said Michael.\n\n\u2018With what happened to my mum and brother, I was scared to lose another person \u2013 but when I met Saima, I fell in love.\n\n\u2018We were proper sweethearts, doing everything together. She was such a compassionate, beautiful woman, and if one good thing can come out of this horrendous situation then it\u2019s to raise that awareness of encephalitis and help other families.\u2019\n\nMichael and Saima on their wedding day in August 2018 (Picture: PA Real Life/Rob Clayton Photography)\n\nSaima on her wedding day, four months before her untimely death (Picture: PA Real Life/Rob Clayton Photography)\n\nMichael said: \u2018We met when I was 25, and she was 27.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018At first, she was hesitant, as I was younger than her, and she wanted somebody settled and mature.\n\n\u2018But we chatted anyway and she soon saw that I am an independent person.\n\n\u2018With what happened to me, I grew up quickly, and have always been a grafter and hard worker. We spoke online for three months before we finally met in person.\n\n\u2018As soon as I saw her in real life, I fell in love.\u2019\n\nThe pair got married on 26 August 2018 in front of their friends and family at Victoria Warehouse in Manchester, before embarking on a two-week-long holiday in Mauritius.\n\nMichael said: \u2018I absolutely bawled my eyes out when I saw Saima in her dress. She looked beautiful.\n\n\u2018We got married under a canopy made from my mum\u2019s wedding dress, so that was really special.\u2019\n\nMichael and Saima on their honeymoon in Mauritius (Picture: PA Real Life/Collect)\n\n\u2018Saima was so strong and elegant and never asked anybody for anything\u2019 (Picture: PA Real Life/Collect)\n\nUnfortunately, Michael\u2019s happy ending didn\u2019t last long.\n\nHe recalls the day he drove her to the hospital, where she would die days later.\n\n\u2018I only worked around a mile-and-a-half away, so I raced right over to get her,\u2019 Michael said.\n\n\u2018She hardly recognised me, and she was struggling to walk, to the point where I had to pick her up and take her to the car.\n\n\u2018When we got to A&E at Stepping Hill Hospital, she collapsed and started to have seizures. At that point, I knew it was something really bad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I told her that I loved her and begged her to stay awake \u2013 but then her eyes rolled back and she stopped responding.\n\n\u2018At that point, I just fell to my knees, crying in the middle of the hospital.\u2019\n\nSaima was placed in an induced coma while doctors ran tests \u2013 a brain scan showed what had caused her seizure: encephalitis.\n\nOn 17 December, they gave Michael the news no husband ever wants to hear.\n\n\u2018Everyone did everything they could, but after four days, during which time they took lots of advice from encephalitis specialists, the medical team told us that her brain and many of her organs weren\u2019t functioning,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Her heart was only beating because she was hooked up to a machine. If they turned it off, she\u2019d have very little chance. When she was in hospital, I remember praying, saying to God, \u201cIf she survives but has no quality of life, please take her\u201d.\n\n\u2018Saima was so strong and elegant and never asked anybody for anything. I knew she would have hated being in a vegetative state, having me as her round-the-clock carer.\n\n\u2018In the end we agreed with the doctors to let her go, and so her family and I gathered around her bedside and the machine was turned off.\u2019\n\nSaima\u2019s funeral took place the day after she died, in keeping with the couple\u2019s Jewish faith (Picture: A Real Life/Rob Clayton Photography)\n\nThe couple were of Jewish faith, which dictates that a body should be buried as soon as possible after death \u2013 Saima\u2019s funeral took place the very next day.\n\nIn honour of his late wife\u2019s memory, Michael has been raising money for The Encephalitis Society, with hopes that more research will prevent deaths.\n\n\u2018I needed to do something to turn this horrendous tragedy into a potential positive for other people,\u2019 said Michael.\n\n\u2018Even those that survive encephalitis can be left with horrible side effects. More research will mean that people like Saima don\u2019t just disappear.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s such a dangerous condition as it\u2019s not like it\u2019s caused by any one thing you can avoid doing. In Saima\u2019s case, doctors don\u2019t even know what triggered it.\u2019\n\nHe\u2019s also taking part in a three-day event, cycling from the location of their wedding in Manchester to Buckingham Palace in London, in April 2020.\n\n\u2018I want to raise as much money as possible so we one day have better drugs and treatments to fight this,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018And I decided to end up at Buckingham Palace, because I wanted somewhere literally fit for a queen, as that\u2019s what Saima was to me.\n\n\u2018Everybody that met her, loved her. She didn\u2019t have a bad bone in her body, and I know I will never meet anybody else like her.\u2019\n\nMORE: Dare you not to cry at this groom surprising the bride with a kitten on their wedding day\n\nMORE: One of UK\u2019s youngest terminal breast cancer patients has beautiful \u2018bucket list\u2019 wedding\n\nMORE: Bride ties the knot wearing a wedding dress made of patches crafted by friends and family\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Michael Herz lost his wife Saima just months after their wedding day as she contracted encephalitis and died in hospital days later.", "authors": ["Almara Abgarian"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_93222032_1572268067.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
