Authorities attributed the incident to a failure to pay a cartel extortion tax, often called a \u201cpiso.\u201d\n\nThe attack occurred at approximately 12:30pm when two gunmen arrived on a motorcycle and opened fire with pistols, according to local reports. The owner of taqueria El Fogonazo, Gonzalo Poot Kant\u00fan, died from multiple gunshot wounds. Two employees and two customers sustained gunshot wounds inside the restaurant.\n\nWitnesses said the two assailants wore helmets to conceal their identities.\n\nInvestigators from the state attorney general\u2019s office believe that cartel operatives targeted the eatery for refusing to pay an extortion tax. Most local businesses in tourist hubs are forced to pay a piso for the right to remain in operation. Merchants are threatened with violence and property damage if they do not comply. The collection of the tax is a large generator of cash flow. In September, Breitbart Texas reported when an extortion gang consisting of municipal police officers was busted in central Mexico.\n\nAuthorities reported the arrests of two males who matched the description of the Sunday shooters. It has not been determined if they are the actual gunmen involved in the attack.\n\nRobert Arce is a retired Phoenix Police detective with extensive experience working Mexican organized crime and street gangs.
