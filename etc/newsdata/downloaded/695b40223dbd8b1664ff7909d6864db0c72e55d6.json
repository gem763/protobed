Then we bet you can relate to at least one of these last-ditch attempts to get in those 10 000 steps\u2026\n\n\u201cI Run Midnight Laps Around My House\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, confession time: I count steps on an app not a gadget (totes old school), so I often don\u2019t realise until it\u2019s really late that I\u2019m off my count for the day. Ahem, did someone say #fail? If I realise I\u2019m going to miss my goal, I run midnight laps around my house, which I accept in the cold light of day is totally dumbass and not really doing anything, but by dead of night, I think it is genius. If my girls are still awake, they join in the baby elephant sprints from one side of the house to the other. And to be fair, sometimes take over altogether. Otherwise, it\u2019s just me, in my jim jams, clutching my phone as I haul my butt around in a tight circuit of front door to back door, around the garden. Repeat. Would love to know what the neighbours think if they hear me slip-slapping across the outside deck at 11.57pm.\u201d \u2014 Danielle Weakley\n\nREAD MORE: What Happens To Your Body When You Stop Working Out\n\n\u201cI Took Reeeaaally Long To Pack\u201d\n\n\u201cI was packing my bag for a work trip. I dragged it out, trudging from the cupboard to the suitcase and back again, carrying one item at a time. It was the most inefficient way of doing things and it earned me about 800 steps \u2013 and my daily goal.\u201d \u2014 Wanita Nicol\n\nAnd then she did this\u2026\n\n\u201cIt was somewhere between 11:30pm and midnight that I glanced at my FitBit and realised I was irritatingly close to reaching my step goal \u2014 and firmly parked on the couch, G&T in hand. My house is too small to do any kind of constructive pacing so I walked laps around the pool instead.\u201d\n\nAnd this\u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2019d given up on getting enough of a workout in to reach my Vitality Rewards, when I suddenly realised I could make them on steps alone. While my husband prepped supper, I sprinted around the neighbourhood gathering steps in the fading light. Fifteen minutes later, I returned, sweaty and exhilarated, mission accomplished.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: This Woman\u2019s Fitness Tracker Literally Helped Save Her Life\n\n\u201cI Danced, Lunged And High-Kicked In An Aeroplane\u201d\n\n\u201cI recently danced, lunged and high-kicked my way to an extra 2 500 steps in the galley of an aeroplane, en route to New York, at 4am. I couldn\u2019t sleep and needed to stretch my legs, but the extra steps were a bonus.\u201d \u2014 Leigh Cann\n\nAnd then she did this\u2026\n\n\u201cI noticed, while at a Diana Ross concert in New York, that dancing in the aisles was adding to my steps \u2014 so I ramped it up, singing along to \u2018Stop, in the Name of Love\u2019 and went well over my 10 000 daily goal!\u201d\n\n\u201cEasy Cheat: I Swing My Arms Wildly\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been known to do jumping jacks in my two-metre-long bedroom, alternating it with high knees, or just simply swinging my arms really wildly. My dogs often think I\u2019ve lost my mind. This is definitely a possibility.\u201d \u2014 Michelle October\n\nREAD MORE: 5 Reasons Why You Should Track Your Workout\n\n\u201cI Run In One Spot In The Bathroom Before A Shower\u201d\n\n\u201cSince I\u2019ve taken up swimming, I can\u2019t count steps as my Fitbit isn\u2019t waterproof. I also do heated yoga, which doesn\u2019t help to get the amount of steps I need. So, I\u2019ve had to go the extra mile. I occasionally add a short treadmill session before I swim. The worst is when it\u2019s time for bed and there\u2019s another 600 steps to go, so I pace up and down in the room and run in once spot in the bathroom before a shower.\u201d \u2014 Michelle von Schlicht\n\n\u201cI\u2019d Jump Up And Down In The Toilet Cubicle At Work\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I got my Fitbit in my Christmas stocking last year, I couldn\u2019t have been more excited or inspired to get fit and meet all my goals each day. I was so keen that every hour, when I hadn\u2019t meet my 250 step goal, I would do star jumps until I felt that satisfying buzz on my wrist. (This only lasted about a two weeks before I had to return to work, where, although an overt dedication to your fitness is pretty much an unwritten rule, I didn\u2019t have the guts to burst into star jumps once an hour. Instead, I started taking the long route to the bathroom once an hour and once there would pace and jump up and down in the tiny toilet cubicle.)\u201d \u2014 Leigh Champanis-King\n\nAnd then she did this\u2026\n\n\u201cThe craziest thing I\u2019ve down to reach my step goal happened one day when I hadn\u2019t reached my 10 000 steps or my 30 active minutes, so I paced around my flat for 40 minutes until I had reached both. My living room isn\u2019t small, but with two big couches and a console table, there\u2019s only a small L-shaped space for me to walk. Eventually, I was moving so quickly (because: boredom) and in such a tight circle that I got dizzy and had to sit down. Of course, my husband thought I was absolutely crazy \u2014 but, hey, you gotta reach your goals!\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za\n\nImage credit iStock", "description": "Hey, we've all been there RIGHT!?", "authors": ["Women'S Health"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7552/ed884c45a05249a98763a8f334e83494.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
