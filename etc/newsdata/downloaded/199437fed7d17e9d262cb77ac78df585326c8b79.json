It was a gesture \u2013 I believe \u2013 that contradicts the spirit of dialogue that should always inspire us. I don\u2019t know what else to say except that it was a theft, and perhaps that speaks for itself,\u201d Ruffini said.\n\nThe statuettes\u2019 forced eviction from the church follows on weeks of controversy surrounding the identity of the figurines depicting a naked, pregnant woman, which were originally presented to Pope Francis as \u201cOur Lady of the Amazon.\u201d Vatican spokesmen later denied that the statues represent the Virgin Mary.\n\n\u201cIt is not the Virgin Mary, who said it is the Virgin Mary?\u201d said Jesuit Father Giacomo Costa at an October 16 press conference for the synod.\n\nOn October 4, Pope Francis presided over a prayer service in the Vatican gardens where the statues figured prominently.\n\nAt the time, an Amazon tribal chief said that the event appeared to be organized by proponents of Liberation Theology and have \u201cpagan\u201d elements.\n\nJonas Marcolino Macux\u00ed, the chief of the Amazonian Macuxi tribe, said that the indigenous people who participated in the ceremony were \u201ccompletely dominated by Liberation Theology people who want to take advantage of them,\u201d adding that the ceremony looked decidedly \u201cpagan.\u201d\n\nMany Catholics protested when the statues \u2014 which appeared to many as pagan idols with no place in a Christian church \u2014 were placed in a side chapel of the Traspontina church, which has hosted daily indigenous celebrations.\n\nAfter the statues were dumped in the Tiber, the video of the incident was tweeted out by U.S. author and philosophy professor, Taylor Marshall, who suggested that the figurines had been removed as a purification of the church.\n\n\u201cI announce to you with great joy: the Pachamama idols that polluted the Church of St Maria Traspontina have been cast away into the Tiber River as an act of obedience to Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ & in reparation to His Sacred Heart wounded by sin,\u201d he said.\n\nMarshall also insisted that \u201cdestroying pagan idols inside a Catholic church is never theft.\u201d\n\nA number of leading Catholic prelates have expressed their deep concern over the Amazonian synod, suggesting that its working document contained many elements of paganism and that it was being instrumentalized to introduce new practices into the universal church.\n\nOthers have underscored the synods problematic financing when reports revealed that significant funding for the summit had come from the pro-abortion Ford Foundation, despite Pope Francis\u2019 declaration that the Church refuses to accept \u201cdirty money.\n\nThe synod will end next weekend with bishops voting on a series of proposals to be presented to Pope Francis for his consideration. Sometime afterward, Francis is expected to publish an official document incorporating some of these elements at his discretion.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Wooden Amazon fertility statuettes were removed from a church near the Vatican and thrown into the Tiber River Monday.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
