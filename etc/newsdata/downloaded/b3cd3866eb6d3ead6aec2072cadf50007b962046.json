We've got a showstopper made especially for you, courtesy of a local contestant on CBC's Great Canadian Baking Show. 11:29\n\nDirections:\n\nPreheat the oven to 350 F. Line one 12-cup muffin pan with cupcake liners and a second pan with three more. Whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together in a medium-sized bowl until combined. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, until the mixture is smooth. Whisk in the vanilla extract and milk. Set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir gently until combined. The batter will have a few lumps and seem thin but will thicken. Fold in the apples. Fill the cupcake liners three-quarters of the way with batter. Bake for 21\u201323 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Remove from the oven when done; a toothpick inserted in the centre will come out clean when they're ready. Allow the cupcakes to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then remove to a rack to cool completely before frosting. While the cupcakes are cooling, place the butter in a large bowl and using an electric hand mixer (a wooden spoon will work too) whip the butter until it is light and airy. Add in the powdered sugar one cup at a time, mixing in each cup until it is incorporated before adding the next one. Once all the sugar is added, add the salt, vanilla and maple syrup and continue to beat or stir until it is really light and fluffy. Spoon all of the frosting in to a pastry bag or large zipper storage bag and cut the tip or corner off so you'll have an opening about the size of a quarter. Squeeze a large dollop of icing onto each cupcake, so that it almost comes to the edge of the cupcake wrapper. Using one of the cookies, push down on the dollop so that the cookie rests flat as a topper.\n\nThe Great Canadian Baking Show airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. on CBC and the free CBC Gem streaming service.
