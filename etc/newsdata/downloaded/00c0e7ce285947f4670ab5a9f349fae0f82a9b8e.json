He tells O\u2019Keefe, \u201cI didn\u2019t see any other option\u2026I decided to wear a hidden camera to expose the bias.\u201d\n\nWe see a conscious effort on the part of CNN\u2019s leader, Jeff Zucker, to shape the narrative, the way the network will cover an individual or a story.\n\nPoarch records one employee saying he can\u2019t believe CNN hasn\u2019t been able to take down President Trump yet.\n\nRepeatedly, employees talk about Zucker\u2019s hatred for Trump. Nick Neville, a media coordinator at the network, says that Zucker has a \u201cpersonal vendetta\u201d against Trump.\n\nNext Hiram Gonzalez, a floor director, is heard saying that the media created the Trump monster.\n\nThen Poarch records the 9 am editorial call which stars Jeff Zucker. Zucker is heard making the astounding claim that Fox News has been spreading fake news for years. Here are a couple of his remarks:\n\nI think what\u2019s going on in America now is really fundamentally the result of years of fake news, conspiracy nonsense from Fox News. The fake conspiracy nonsense that Fox has spread for years is now deeply embedded into American society and frankly, that is beyond destructive for America. So, I wanna say on the Lindsay Graham front. I know that there\u2019s a lot of people at CNN who are friendly with Lindsay Graham. Time to knock that off and call him out.\n\nWatch Part 1 below.\n\n(O\u2019Keefe said he will be uploading videos all day and night. I will be posting them as they become available.)", "description": "James O\u2019Keefe Releases \u2018Part One\u2019 of #ExposeCNN; One Employee Can\u2019t Believe CNN Hasn\u2019t Taken Down Trump Yet", "authors": ["Elizabeth Vaughn", "Sister Toldjah", "Mike Ford", "Alex Parker", "Nick Arama", "Brandon Morse", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CNN-log-e1571075508745.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
