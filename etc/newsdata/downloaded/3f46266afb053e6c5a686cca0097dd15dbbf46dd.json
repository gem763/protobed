Lance Cpl. William Kyle Carpenter, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran of the War in Afghanistan and Medal of Honor recipient, in a Monday interview on SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow.\n\nCarpenter reflected on the genesis of his forthcoming book You Are Worth It: Building a Life Worth Fighting For, scheduled for release on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThis book started many, many years before I started writing it two years ago,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cI was injured by an enemy hand grenade in Afghanistan in 2010. I spent three years recovering at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. \u2026 And through that three years, I was forced to search for the silver linings during the long dark and painful nights and days in the hospital.\u201d\n\nCarpenter sought to write a book with broad appeal and expansive applicability.\n\n\u201cAfter leaving my three years at Walter Reed \u2014 and just having an amazing recovery thanks to the incredible staff there, my family, and so many loving and supporting people around the country \u2014 I immediately drove out of the gate of Walter Reed, and I drove down to Columbia, South Carolina, and moved into my small one-bedroom apartment there to start my freshman year at college,\u201d recalled Carpenter. \u201cI graduated from college December of 2017 and looking ahead and thinking about potentially starting a book, I just kept getting hung up before even starting because I didn\u2019t want to write a book that only people that have served in the military or that have been to combat could understand. I wanted a book that transcended all boundaries and that anyone could pick up and not only understand but take lessons from.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\nThe centrality and universality of struggle to the human condition formed the perspective of his book, revealed Carpenter.\n\n\u201cAll of these experiences over the years leading up to this book, at the time, they were just that \u2014 they were experiences, something that happened,\u201d Carpenter remarked. \u201cThere was always the next therapy appointment, next surgery, next college exam, but with time and deep thought, those evolved into life lessons, which then evolved into perspective. And I think we can never have enough perspective. And so, I wrote this book from the angle of struggle because going through these events and these meet and greets, as I was thinking about how I wanted to write this book, people would always come up to me after these events and say, \u2018Oh, well, I was never in the military, but,\u2019 and then proceed to tell me their own version of struggle. So that was kind of a light bulb moment for me, like, \u2018Oh, of course, I can write about struggle,\u2019 because everyone \u2014 physically, mentally, or emotionally \u2014 can relate to struggle.\u201d\n\nCarpenter determined, \u201cStruggle is that one common fiber throughout every single person on this Earth, and so, yes, [my book] has a chapter or two about Afghanistan and my injury to give context to my journey, but it\u2019s so much more that. It\u2019s primarily written from the blast on because, like I said, I wanted people to [connect with my story]. \u2026 They might have never spent three years in a hospital bed, but they know what pain is.\u201d\n\nCarpenter realized the value of the scars he developed from his injury and subsequent surgeries while trying to minimize their visibility with scar revision therapy.\n\n\u201cWhile I was at Walter Reed, I couldn\u2019t rush my surgeries anymore than I was, so in between all of those therapy hours and surgeries, a lot of my doctors were addressing \u2026 some scars on my face, if I wanted to, I could just come by the clinic and do scar revision therapy,\u201d recalled Carpenter. \u201cAt this point in my recovery \u2026 I hadn\u2019t really had the deep thought to follow my hospital time and really realize the lessons that I had learned along the way, so I thought, \u2018Okay. I\u2019ll try some scar revision therapy.\u2019 I go into the clinic, and not only is it extremely painful, but I come out and my face \u2014 I mean, I was unrecognizable. I was swollen. I didn\u2019t even recognize myself in the mirror.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt that moment, I had a few epiphanies, one was: I\u2019m trying to buffer out a scratch on a car that has been completely totaled,\u201d quipped Carpenter. \u201cBoth my arms are skin grafted, my right one from \u2014 it doesn\u2019t function right \u2014 so even if I didn\u2019t have the scars, you would be able to [observe my injury]. I have skin grafts and scars from my wrists all the way to the top of my shoulder.\u201d\n\nCarpenter continued, \u201cSo there was that, but on a deeper level, I realized: why am I trying to do this when I\u2019m going around the country and speaking to people and trying to share hope that it\u2019s okay \u2014 physically, mentally, or emotionally \u2014 if you get injured and if you have scars. I kind of felt like a hypocrite almost.\n\n\u201cScars are truly a beautiful thing,\u201d declared Carpenter. \u201cYes, they can be a little ugly on the outside, but scars show that you\u2019re a survivor, that you made it through something, and not only did you make it through, but now you\u2019re stronger and wiser and more educated because of that tough time that you went through. It\u2019s my favorite chapter in the book \u2014 Don\u2019t Hide Your Scars, Chapter 13 \u2014 and this kind of realization how scars connect all of us and how struggle connects all of us.\u201d\n\nCarpenter was awarded the Medal of Honor for using his body as a shield to protect a fellow Marine from an enemy hand grenade. His Medal of Honor citation reads:\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as an Automatic Rifleman with Company F, 2d Battalion, 9th Marines, Regimental Combat Team 1, 1st Marine Division (Forward), 1 Marine Expeditionary Force (Forward), in Helmand Province, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom on 21 November 2010. Lance Corporal Carpenter was a member of a platoon-sized coalition force, comprised of two reinforced Marine squads partnered with an Afghan National Army squad. The platoon had established Patrol Base Dakota two days earlier in a small village in the Marjah District in order to disrupt enemy activity and provide security for the local Afghan population. Lance Corporal Carpenter and a fellow Marine were manning a rooftop security position on the perimeter of Patrol Base Dakota when the enemy initiated a daylight attack with hand grenades, one of which landed inside their sandbagged position. Without hesitation, and with complete disregard for his own safety, Lance Corporal Carpenter moved toward the grenade in an attempt to shield his fellow Marine from the deadly blast. When the grenade detonated, his body absorbed the brunt of the blast, severely wounding him, but saving the life of his fellow Marine. By his undaunted courage, bold fighting spirit, and unwavering devotion to duty in the face of almost certain death, Lance Corporal Carpenter reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.\n\nBreitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.", "description": "\"Scars are a truly beautiful thing,\" said\u00a0William Kyle Carpenter, a veteran of the War in Afghanistan and Medal of Honor recipient.", "authors": ["Robert Kraychik"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Kyle-Carpenter-You-Are-Worth-It-book-fb-ap-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
