Those that remain open and functional can only accommodate up to 300,000 of the 650,000 school-age children, according to the charity.\n\nThe family are among more than a million people displaced from other parts of the country to Idlib. Ghassan and his family are originally from Aleppo province. They fled before the government\u2019s offensive to recapture the city, during which their house was destroyed. Now they live in rented accommodation.\n\nDespite their young ages, the boys have already witnessed so much.

[There was] another woman who was killed by stoning, and a man who was thrown off the building. This is how life has become, disaster,\u201d says Yazan.\n\n\u201cThe hardest thing is seeing the bodies on the ground, the faces of the innocent, dead people, to see a man chopped up to pieces, carried away in sacks.

He cannot afford the clothes and supplies they need.\n\n\u201cOur situation cannot allow for schools or the like,\u201d he says. \u201cIf today he wants the money for a notebook, I\u2019d say to him that I don\u2019t have it.
