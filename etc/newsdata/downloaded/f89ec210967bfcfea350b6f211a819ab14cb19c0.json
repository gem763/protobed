And Trump has made no secret of his ire over the weakness of other currencies relative to the dollar. Trump even got into a scrap earlier this year with European Central Bank President Mario Draghi over the weakness of the euro , while often referring to the dollar's strength when bashing the Federal Reserve and his handpicked chairman, Jerome Powell, for not cutting rates more aggressively.\n\nBut \"deep challenges\" facing policy makers in Europe and Asia \"now mean that it will be Washington's job to get the dollar weaker -- either through trade conciliation or the Fed shifting to a full-on easing cycle,\" Turner said. \"Neither of those outcomes look immediate, meaning that the risk environment could well deteriorate into year-end.\"\n\nThat would also be good news for the Japanese yen, he said, a traditional haven.\n\nAs for the euro, its likely to languish in the $1.05 - $1.10 range versus the dollar into year-end as Europe's slowdown broadens from the manufacturing sector into services and the ECB resumes its bond purchases. Meanwhile, the prospect of a further extension the U.K.'s current Oct. 31 deadline for leaving the European Union could weaken the British pound by another 5%, Turner said.\n\nThe ICE U.S. Dollar Index , a non-trade-weighted measure of the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, has given back some ground this month, pulling back around 0.6% so far in October. But it remains up 2.7% for the year to date and around 3.3% over the last 12 months after hitting a more-than-two-year high on Oct. 1.\n\nStocks continue to trade within hailing distance of all-time highs, with the S&P 500 rising nearly 18% so far this year and the Dow Jones Industrial Average , up 14%. That marks a rebound, however, from a steep fourth-quarter selloff last year. Over the longer run, stocks have moved relatively sideways.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 07, 2019 12:18 ET (16:18 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
