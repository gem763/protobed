Having said that, characterless chains abound, and with NYC being one of the most expensive cities around for accommodation, it\u2019s easy to end up with a dud.\n\nSo how to sift the wheat from the chaff? Pick a neighbourhood and decide whether you want to stump up for something fancy or if you\u2019re happy to go back to basics, as long as it\u2019s stylish. Here are my favourite places that combine soul and style, that ditch buttoned-up service, and feel steeped in the spirit of this caffeinated city.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe Independent's hotel reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.

Their London-centric design formula may be familiar \u2013 a slick 16-floor, 86-room newbuild filled with characterful design \u2013 but as in their other hotels, the interiors are a tonic of colour and textures thanks to Kit\u2019s artful imagination (minimalists steer clear). Specially commissioned witty artworks and larger than-life-sculptures are scattered throughout the building. A wall glows with artist Martha Freud\u2019s votive ceramics, each etched with different New York landmarks. In the bar, the cocktails are first class \u2013 try a tangy Whitby Paloma (Ocho Blanco tequila infused with house-made marmalade, fresh pink grapefruit, lime, agave and soda) \u2013 while the leafy Orangery terrace is a blissful retreat from the concrete jungle.\n\nDoubles from $695 (\u00a3525), room only\n\nfirmdalehotels.com\u200b\n\nBest for history: The Inn at Irving Place\n\nThis intimate turn-of-the-century brownstone townhouse is a rare breed of old-fashioned retreat in Gramercy Park. Classic chintzes, Tiffany lamps, Victorian curios and the odd four-poster bed make this tiny 12-room hotel a world away from the contemporary cool that dominates Manhattan\u2019s accommodation landscape. Be sure to book a pretty table at their tea salon Lady Mendl\u2019s, to enjoy the refined five-course afternoon spread. Note that children aren\u2019t allowed \u2013 it\u2019s for 12 years and upwards.\n\nDoubles from $445 (\u00a3330), B&B\n\ninnatirving.com\u200b\n\nBest for design: The High Line Hotel\n\nIn the heart of Chelsea\u2019s gallery district, this neo-Gothic former seminary with its Intelligentsia coffee truck and bar parked outside is an expert at blending heritage with hip. eBay-sourced Victorian and Edwardian antiques are among the furnishings, perfect for the Instagram generation.\n\nNot to be confused with the much flashier Standard High Line, which is a few blocks south, this is off the tourist trail on Tenth Avenue, a block from the High Line park and close to Chelsea Market\u2019s many foodie delights. Service and facilities come with a light touch; in the absence of a concierge desk, this quirkier spot is suited to seasoned visitors to the city who don\u2019t need their hands holding by the kind of brass badge-flaunting staff in starched suits you get at the big chain hotels.\n\nDoubles from $250 (\u00a3180), room only\n\nthehighlinehotel.com\u200b\n\nBest for value: The Marlton\n\nHotelier Sean MacPherson is a master of creating a seemingly historical hotel that fits into the fabric of a once-seedy district \u2013 look no further than his most famous project, the Bowery Hotel, for evidence. For The Marlton\u2019s 2013 opening, he gave this nine-storey, 1900-built building a new lease of life \u2013 a world away from its original incarnation as a student dorm.\n\nA block north of Washington Park, the 107 rooms are small but well designed, exemplifying MacPherson\u2019s shtick of crisp quality bed linens, Persian rugs and seemingly vintage yet utterly modern bathrooms. The sociable lobby lounge and bistro at the back make it a favourite with the music and fashion pack, and service is friendly but unashamedly low key.\n\nDoubles from $200 (\u00a3150), room only\n\nmarltonhotel.com\u200b\n\nBest for families: The Carlyle\n\nHaving the top-hatted bellhops at this Beaux Arts brick building (now owned by Rosewood Hotels) open the door to you in the same way they do for high-profile dignitaries is enough to give you a thrill. Find your way to one of its 188 rooms and suites, and you don\u2019t know which VIP or celebrity you might pass; last time I was there, Daphne Guinness was getting a blow-dry in the salon.\n\nThe eye-popping cityscape views from the upper floors evoke sweeping opening scenes from the movies. George Gershwin spent time here in the 1930s, and today Woody Allen is known as a weekly regular, having played the clarinet with Caf\u00e9 Carlyle\u2019s resident jazz band. Although it recently underwent a refurb, Bemelmans Bar is as atmospheric as ever, with murals hand-painted by \u2013 and named after \u2013 Ludwig Bemelmans, author of the Madeline children\u2019s books, who painted the bar in return for living here in the 1950s. Because of the link, the hotel is a good bet for well-heeled families, with Madeline-themed packages and good provisions for children.\n\nDoubles from $800 (\u00a3600), room only\n\nrosewoodhotels.com\u200b\n\nBest for views: Standard High Line\n\nHip hotelier Andr\u00e9 Balazs may have sold his pop culture-loving hotel brand, but its most iconic 18-floor high-riser still straddles the High Line in the heart of the Meatpacking District, an arm\u2019s length from Chelsea\u2019s galleries and the Whitney Museum of American Art. Voyeurs and exhibitionists alike appreciate the wall-to-wall windows in the 338 rooms, which ensure you can see and be seen (remember that, as you reach for your bathrobe).\n\nThe Standard Grill steakhouse is another place to see and be seen, as is the street-level German pub, Biergarten, complete with ping pong tables. The rooftop Le Bain bar is as exclusive today as it was when it opened \u2013 non-residents have to queue, and though hotel guests aren\u2019t guaranteed admission, they get priority.\n\nDoubles from $295 (\u00a3220), room only\n\nstandardhotels.com\u200b\n\nBest for hipsters: The Ludlow\n\nPart of the gentrification of the once gritty Lower East Side, the Ludlow opened in 2014 opposite Katz\u2019s Delicatessen. The days of artists living in cheap lofts are long gone, but the hotel lobby evokes a louche 1980s vibe of dive bars and underground recording studios, with a sociable work-rest-and-play space with low-slung leather sofas and giant Marshall speakers.\n\nBedrooms are bright and breezy, and most have incredible views over the city. A perk of staying in this place is that you can also leapfrog the techpreneurs and art-world hotshots who hang out here to get into the popular ground-floor restaurant, Dirty French, which is always booked up.\n\nDoubles from $195 (\u00a3145), room only\n\nludlowhotel.com\u200b\n\nBest for shopping: The Mercer\n\nIf the hotel industry had its own almanack, the birth of this 75-room hotel (Andre Balazs\u2019s creation) in 1998 would be catalogued as having set the blueprint for the boutique trend. Twenty years on, the exposed brick and wooden floorboards in the bedrooms are as on point as ever. Here, near Apple\u2019s HQ, in a 1890 Romanesque Revival mansion, Soho\u2019s media and music wranglers and fashion luvvies still head to chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten\u2019s Mercer Kitchen restaurant down below to schmooze, booze and make their moves.\n\nDoubles from $600 (\u00a3445), room only\n\nmercerhotel.com\n\nBest for eco chic: 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge\n\nBarry Sternlicht declares this the best hotel he\u2019s ever created \u2013 and as the founder of W Hotels, he knows what he\u2019s talking about. A 25ft living wall of figs and ferns in the lobby, decor made from reclaimed materials, wind-powered electricity and a dedicated triple-filtered drinking water tap in every room confirm that this a seriously eco-friendly hotel \u2013 there\u2019s even a Tesla available for local transfers. The bedrooms are a warm and welcoming tableau of upcycled wood and natural, organic fabrics. Be sure to book one which enjoys epic views over the Brooklyn Bridge and East River, but for the full scene in high definition head to the tenth-floor rooftop where there\u2019s also a pool.\n\nDoubles from $350 (\u00a3260), room only\n\n1hotels.com\u200b\n\nBest sense of place: The Wythe\n\nA former textile factory, The Wythe\u2019s pine-beamed, brick-walled, cast-iron-columned bedrooms overlook Brooklyn\u2019s (current) beer brewery, making this the most authentic of the crop of hip hotels in this corner of Brooklyn. It\u2019s also the most appealing, thanks to the attention to detail by the owner Andrew Tarlow, the man behind hipster delicatessen, Marlow & Sons. The minibars are packed with superior snacks, and there\u2019s a tip-top brasserie, Reynard.\n\nIn the rooms, specially made wallpapers by local artists reference the neighbourhood, while Goldie\u2019s natural soaps are among the hyperlocal amenities. Cocktails should be taken on the Manhattan-view rooftop bar \u2013 the hotel is only a couple of blocks from the East River.\n\nDoubles from $300 (\u00a3225), room only\n\nwythehotel.com\u200b\n\nBest for New York first-timers: INNSIDE Nomad\n\nNeighbourhood: Chelsea\n\nThis hotel is the United States\u2019 first INNSIDE, a sub-brand of Spanish company Melia, which has several outposts across Europe. On the periphery of Broadway, the INNSIDE Nomad is a sleek addition to the streets of Chelsea, which doubles as both a cosy bolthole for tourists and a handy base for business travellers working in Midtown.\n\nIts well-designed and bright guest rooms, fitted with floor-to-ceiling windows, offer superb views of Midtown and the Freedom Tower; while signature restaurant The Wilson does a neat line in fresh seafood dishes. The 24-hour fitness centre and proximity to Midtown will suit business travellers, but it's first-time visitors to New York that the hotel really caters for. The hotel offers the INNSIDE Urban Guide, packed full of New York tips from locals, to make the most of your stay.\n\nRooms from \u00a3132 a night\n\nmelia.com\n\nThis article has been updated.
