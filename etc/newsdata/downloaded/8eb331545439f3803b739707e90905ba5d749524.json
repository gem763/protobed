called to a small kitchen fire were unable to stop the flames spreading rapidly up cladding on the outside of the flat block, and some residents were trapped in their flats.\n\nWitnesses described seeing people waving from windows or shining lights in attempts to attract help when they were not rescued by firefighters, and the standard \u201cstay put\u201d advice for people to stay in their flats was not officially abandoned until two hours after the fire started.\n\nThe Grenfell Tower inquiry heard that residents initially instructed by 999 operators to stay inside their homes were not told to evacuate because of a policy not to re-contact callers.\n\nThe London Fire Brigade said the Grenfell disaster was the largest residential blaze in its history and it was still supporting firefighters, control officers and other staff who were involved.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email
