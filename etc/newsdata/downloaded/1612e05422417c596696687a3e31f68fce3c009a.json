(Alex Brandon/AP)\n\nHouse Republicans aren\u2019t ruling out backing a potential deal between President Trump and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to let the government negotiate lower drug prices in the Medicare program, long a liberal aspiration.\n\nBut until a Trump/Pelosi deal actually happens \u2014 and that\u2019s highly in doubt (check out our Monday Health 202 on the topic) \u2014 Republicans are fiercely opposing a bill Pelosi is pushing forward on her own this week, which would allow the government to directly negotiate with drug companies for lower prices for up to 250 drugs per year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s premature to speculate where the president will go on this,\u201d Rep. Kevin Brady (Tex.), ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, told reporters. \u201cRight now he\u2019s asking us to work on bipartisan legislation that lowers drug prices.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s measure hasn\u2019t garnered support from a single Republican \u2014 even though lowering drug prices was supposed to be a broad bipartisan effort this year. Instead, it represents the route Democrats would like to take if they could act unilaterally, without cooperation from the Trump White House and the GOP-majority Senate.\n\nRep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee. (Kate Patterson for The Washington Post)\n\nAnd Republicans are irate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re serious about bringing down the high cost of drugs,\u201d said Rep. Greg Walden (Ore.), ranking Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee. \u201cWe were on a path to do this in a bipartisan way until the speaker\u2019s office got in the middle of it and made this a partisan pothole.\u201d\n\nThis morning, the Energy and Commerce Committee will mark up Pelosi's bill and vote on it while two other committees \u2014 the Ways and Means Committee and the Education and Labor Committee \u2014 hold hearings on the legislation. Walden said Republican members of the Energy and Commerce Committee will try to offer more than 200 amendments during the markup.\n\nPelosi, caught between the demands of liberals and moderates in her caucus, agreed to revise the legislation slightly by raising the floor of drugs the government must negotiate per year from 25 to 35. Those changes brought a few more progressives on board with the legislation, including Reps. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) and Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), but House passage may still not be guaranteed.\n\n\u201cThe American people need bold action, and that\u2019s what we are delivering today,\u201d Pelosi said yesterday.\n\nYet Pelosi\u2019s approach contrasts with that of the Senate, where the leaders of the Finance Committee have crafted a bipartisan bill that doesn\u2019t include allowing the government to negotiate lower Medicare prices. Brady and Walden say they\u2019re still reviewing that bill but stressed that they\u2019re eager to replicate the bipartisan approach in the House.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d Brady said. \u201cRepublicans were working in a bipartisan manner with Democrats in the House on lowering drug prices.\u201d\n\nThe political machinations aside, here\u2019s what would have to happen for any major legislation to lower drug prices. Trump and Pelosi would ultimately have to hash out an agreement that could pass both the Democratic-led House and the Republican-led Senate.\n\nThe biggest policy sticking point would be whether to allow direct drug price negotiations in Medicare. Trump has said he likes the idea, but he would face an uphill battle from conservatives and the pharmaceutical industry if he pushes for it. The White House notably hasn\u2019t come out against Pelosi's measure \u2014 indicating that it\u2019s trying to keep negotiations alive.\n\nThe whole effort underscores the deep difficulty in passing legislation shaking up the country\u2019s pharmaceutical industry, which leads the world in developing new treatments and cures and yet also charges far more for medications than in any other advanced economy.\n\nAs if the Pelosi bill wasn\u2019t already controversial enough, the Congressional Budget Office \u2014 which estimates the costs and savings of legislation \u2014 reached two major conclusions about the measure: that it would result in massive saving for the government but also harm the development of new drugs.\n\nIn a partial analysis released last week, the CBO estimated it would save a huge amount of money \u2014 $345 billion over a decade. To put that in perspective, it would reduce costs for Medicare\u2019s prescription drug program by about a quarter.\n\nAndy Slavitt, former administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Barack Obama:\n\nBREAKING: WOW. Pelosi drug pricing bill scored by nonpartisan CBO would lower drug prices as much as 55%.\n\n\n\nPatients would save $158 billion. And Medicare would save $345 billion. https://t.co/GukDwo7Ijy \u2014 Andy Slavitt (@ASlavitt) October 15, 2019\n\nBut the CBO\u2019s other conclusion is fueling charges by Republicans, conservative activists and pharmaceutical companies that the Pelosi bill would stymie development of new drugs. The agency said there\u2019s a consequence to the reduced spending: fewer new drugs coming on the market.\n\nThe agency estimates 8 to 15 fewer drugs would be approved over the next decade. That\u2019s not a huge sum, considering the Food and Drug Administration is estimated to approve about 300 drugs in the same time frame.\n\nBrady, Walden and other opponents of the Pelosi bill say it could have a chilling effect on developing untried treatments, causing manufacturers to instead focus on simply improving medications already on the market.\n\n\u201cThe president has never told me he wants a solution that actually discourages new cures,\u201d Brady said.\n\nYou are reading The Health 202, our must-read newsletter on health policy.

Cummings, a Democratic congressman from Maryland, died early Thursday morning at Gilchrist Hospice Care, a Johns Hopkins affiliate in Baltimore. He was 68.\n\n\u201cAfter undergoing an unspecified medical procedure, the Democratic leader did not return to his office this week, the Baltimore Sun reported. A statement from his office said that he had passed away due to \u2018complications concerning longstanding health challenges,\u2019\u201d our colleagues Jenna Portnoy and Antonia Noori Farzan report.\n\nBorn to a family of Southern sharecroppers and Baptist preachers, Cummings became one of the most powerful Democrats in Congress. During the Trump presidency, he made efforts to work with the Trump administration, but they mostly proved fruitless, Jenna and Antonia write. \u201cIn a bipartisan gesture, he attended Trump\u2019s inauguration and, at the luncheon afterward, raised an issue on which he felt they could find common ground, lowering prescription drug prices. In that and in future encounters, he urged the president to pursue policies that could unite the country and burnish his legacy. The congressman said that after a few promising meetings, he never heard from Trump again.\u201d\n\nAHH, OOF and OUCH\n\nPresident Trump hands then-Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin a pen after signing an executive order in January 2018. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nAHH: Trump floated issuing an executive order to shutter parts of the Veterans Affairs health system, according to a description by former VA secretary David Shulkin in an upcoming book, as the Associated Press\u2019s Hope Yen reports.\n\nShulkin details a March 2017 White House meeting during which Trump discussed ways to make the changes at what he described as \u201cthe most corrupt\u201d and \u201cprobably the most incompetently run\u201d department. He asked whether \u201cwe should begin to close the VAs.\u201d When Shulkin told the president that the agency was working with lawmakers on a review process to address underperforming VA facilities, the president responded: \u201cSo, let\u2019s just do an executive order!\u201d\n\n\u201cShulkin told the AP that ultimately he dissuaded Trump from pursuing that route, persuading him to sign executive orders for changes with wider support, such as expanded telehealth options for veterans,\u201d Hope writes. \u201cThe 2017 Oval Office conversation is illustrative of Trump\u2019s early intentions toward the VA and remains significant as he pushes for reelection, citing in part his accomplishments in expanding Choice and boosting mental health care for veterans. Veterans as a group have largely backed Trump throughout his presidency, despite lingering questions about his intentions about preserving the VA.\u201d\n\nA 33-year-old lies in the intensive care unit of the University of Utah Hospital while being treated for vaping-related illness and other lung infections in Salt Lake City. (Courtesy of Marisela Trujillo via Reuters)\n\nOOF: A top federal health official warned lawmakers that the number of vaping-related lung illnesses is expected to \u201cconsiderably\u201d rise, with more cases being reported every day.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s most recent update reported that more than 1,200 people have been sickened and at least 26 people have been killed by the mysterious disease that the agency is tentatively calling EVALI, or \u201ce-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury.\u201d But CDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat told lawmakers on a House Appropriations subcommittee that more cases are being reported every day, CNBC\u2019s Angelica LaVito reports.\n\nIt was Schuchat\u2019s third appearance before lawmakers in the past month. \u201cThis is extremely complicated and difficult. It\u2019s fatal or potentially fatal, with half of the cases requiring intensive care,\u201d she said.\n\nA pedestrian walks across the street from a McKesson sign in San Francisco. (Jeff Chiu/AP)\n\nOUCH: The nation\u2019s three largest drug distributors and two manufacturers are in talks to settle thousands of opioid cases with a $50 billion agreement before the landmark trial is set to begin next week, the New York Times\u2019s Jan Hoffman reports. But details are still being ironed out, and the agreement could falter before opening statements on Monday.\n\nThe drug giants have agreed on a framework of a deal, and \u201ccities and counties across the country are tentatively supporting the broad parameters of the deal but are negotiating over its total value as well as attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d\n\nAnother detail to finalize would be the timeline for how the settlement funds would be paid. Whom the money goes to \u2014 and how much of it will go toward attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 is also still wrapped up in negotiation.\n\n\u201cThe agreement would release AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson, which together distribute about 90 percent of the country\u2019s medicines, along with Johnson & Johnson and Teva, the Israeli-based manufacturer of generic medicines, from a rapidly growing list of more than 2,300 lawsuits that they face in federal and state courts,\u201d Jan writes. \u201c\u2026 Whether the amount will be considered sufficient by all the plaintiffs remains to be seen.\u201d\n\nSECOND OPINION\n\n\u2014Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) didn't want to acknowledge at this week's debate that Medicare-for-all would require people to pay higher taxes. But Americans already pay a major hidden \u201ctax\u201d to fund health care, a pair of economists argue in their new book.\n\nEmmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, a pair of economists from the University of California at Berkeley, argue private health insurance costs are \u201ctaxes in everything but name,\u201d our Post colleague Christopher Ingraham writes. The difference is those \u201ctaxes\u201d are paid to private insurance companies instead of to the federal government, the economists argue in their book \u201cThe Triumph of Injustice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are automatically deducted from workers\u2019 paychecks. And they are essentially mandatory for families who don\u2019t want to be crippled by long-term health-care costs or unexpected illnesses,\u201d Christopher writes. \u201c\u2026 Saez and Zucman have produced an estimate of just how much we\u2019re already paying for health insurance and find it\u2019s a little north of $1 trillion per year: \u2018close to 6% of national income in 2019 \u2014 the equivalent of one-third of all federal income tax payments!\u2019 Health insurance costs raise the average effective tax rate on American labor from 29 percent to 37 percent, they said.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) during the Democratic presidential primary debate in Westerville, Ohio. (John Minchillo/AP)\n\n\u2014 Leana Wen, an emergency physician and the ousted former chief executive of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, panned the fourth Democratic presidential debate for being largely focused on Medicare-for-all instead of other pressing health issues.\n\n\u201cThe controversial idea of abolishing private insurance in favor of a single, government-run program certainly deserves some rigorous back-and-forth,\u201d she wrote in an op-ed for The Post. \u201cBut not at the expense of issues with a much greater impact on our health.\u201d\n\nShe wrote that closure of rural hospitals, the loss of services \u2014 including obstetrics \u2014 at these hospitals, reproductive health-care deserts, the cost of prescription drugs and the opioid crisis are other critical topics that deserve airtime.\n\n\u201cTo be fair, multiple candidates have proposals for stabilizing rural hospitals, funding community health centers, protecting women\u2019s health care and incentivizing health professionals to work in underserved areas. But you wouldn\u2019t know it from the substance of the campaign so far,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe American people need to hear more about these ideas on how \u2014 literally \u2014 to access care, which is a prerequisite to discussion of how to pay for it.\u201d\n\nMEDICAL MISSIVES\n\n(iStock)\n\n\u2014 Youth suicide rates have increased by 56 percent in the decade between 2007 and 2017. And in 2019, the suicide rate for adolescents and young adults surpassed the homicide death rate.\n\nAccording to a CDC report, people ages 10 to 24 saw a decreased suicide rate from 2007 to 2017, but the rate climbed again through 2017, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Brianna Abbott reports.\n\n\u201cDespite concern over the rising suicide rates, researchers aren\u2019t sure of the exact causes. A rise in depression among adolescents, drug use, stress and access to firearms might all be contributing factors, experts say,\u201d she writes. \u201cSome mental-health experts suggest that social-media use among teens might be fueling the increase in mental-health conditions and leading to greater suicide risk, and some early studies have linked smartphone use to anxiety, depression and sleep deprivation among adolescents.\u201d\n\nSuicide became in 2017 the second-leading cause of death for that age group, behind unintentional injuries including drug overdoses.\n\nBenjamin Shain, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at NorthShore Medical Group in Illinois, told Brianna he is seeing a growing number of young patients who pose a suicide risk. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s not surprising, but it is highly disturbing,\u201d he said. \u201cTo see it statistically across the country hits me in a different way.\u201d\n\nHEALTH ON THE HILL\n\n\u2014 And here are a few more good reads:\n\nPolitics How Bernie Sanders scored a coup and won the backing of Ocasio-Cortez and Omar The endorsements of Sanders by Ocasio-Cortez and Omar suggest that despite Warren\u2019s rise, the battle for the allegiance of the Democratic Party\u2019s liberal wing is far from over.
