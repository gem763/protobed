They should find somebody who wants to do it.\u201d\n\nThose comments echoed ones he made a year earlier, when he threw doubt on whether he would be returning to the part that won him an Emmy Award. \u201cI enjoy doing it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut what\u2019s going to happen in the future? I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going to working, where I\u2019m going to be.\u201d He added, \u201cThey should get somebody who can do it all the time.\u201d\n\nNow, with SNL\u2019s 45th season premiere just a few weeks away, Baldwin is once again speaking out about his experience playing Trump. And this time, he sounds even more opposed to the idea of continuing to embody the president on a near-weekly basis.\n\nOn the season three premiere of his YouTube series Hiking with Kevin, former SNL cast member Kevin Nealon asked Baldwin if he ever gets \u201ctired\u201d of playing Trump. \u201cOh yeah,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI think every time I did Trump after the first season\u2014the first season everybody was high, they were in a lot of pain, they were confused.\u201d Even those who \u201cdidn\u2019t like\u201d Hillary Clinton thought it was \u201cimpossible\u201d that Trump would win the election, the actor said.\n\nBaldwin said the 2016-2017 season, which included a handful of episodes leading up to the election and the beginning of Trump\u2019s first term, was \u201cfun, fun, fun.\u201d But, he added, the next two seasons after that, every time he would have to play Trump, he would sit in his dressing room and think, \u201cI hope a meteor hits this building and kills me because I don\u2019t want to do this ever again. I hate this.\u201d\n\nOn the flip side, Baldwin added that every time he thinks \u201cpeople are sick of this, I\u2019m sick on this, I don\u2019t want to do it anymore,\u201d he\u2019ll go to a restaurant and \u201c50 people say something\u201d positive to him about his impression. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t like is, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s doing anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not doing anything good or bad for him.\u201d\n\nLater in the episode, Baldwin said that he would \u201clove\u201d to run for public office someday, but his wife Hilaria told him she would divorce him if he did. Asked by Nealon if he has too much \u201cbaggage\u201d to run for president, Baldwin said, \u201cTrump had a lot of baggage and he won. I don\u2019t think any of my baggage was sexual assault.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy baggage is taking the bait,\u201d Baldwin continued. He claimed that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be tussling with someone over a parking spot if I were president,\u201d referring to his most recent run-in with the law.\n\nFinally, Nealon asked Baldwin who his running mate would be if he did run for president. \u201cTom Hanks,\u201d he answered without missing a beat.\n\nLook out for our interview with Kevin Nealon on next week\u2019s episode of The Last Laugh podcast.", "description": "The actor told former SNL-er Kevin Nealon he would sit in his dressing room and think, \u2018I hope a meteor hits this building and kills me because I don\u2019t want to do this ever again.\u2019", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567726710/x1080_hneflk", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
