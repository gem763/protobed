While average prices have been lower this year when compared to 2018 the production efficiencies of both upstream and downstream operations has helped push revenues to levels close to last year, when total revenues got to within touching distance of $300bn.\n\nweren\u2019t expected to come in close to the levels seen in Q2 given the decline in oil prices seen since then, however they still show a company that is nimbler and more efficient than it was a decade ago. Currently BP (LON: ) has breakeven prices of just below $50 a barrel, however the jury remains out as to whether buying BHP Billiton\u2019s shale assets for $10bn was a wise move in the current environment.\n\nExpectations were for income to come in at $1.8bn, however the numbers came in well above that at $2.25bn, confounding expectations of a much weaker quarter, and though profits attributable to shareholders showed a quarterly loss of $700m, this was due to a tax charge of $2.6bn.\n\nThe $2.25bn number was still well below that of the $3.8bn of a year ago, given that oil prices are still below last year\u2019s levels, but it would appear that better than expected downstream revenues have helped boost the numbers during the quarter. This outperformance was helped by record output at the Whiting and Cherry Point refineries. This helped offset a weaker upstream performance which was impacted by adverse weather conditions in the Gulf of Mexico, and probably won\u2019t be repeated in Q4, putting the company on course for a fairly decent year.\n\nThis month\u2019s news that Bob Dudley has decided to retire as CEO of BP (LON: ) after 40 years with the company, at the end of this fiscal year, is therefore a neat way to bring the curtain down on an illustrious career, while at the same time completing the job of navigating the company through its darkest hour, in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil disaster.\n\nWith Bob Dudley on his way out, new CEO Bernard Looney will have to oversee the challenges of potentially lower oil prices, as well as the ongoing transition to renewables at a time when debt levels still remain uncomfortably high, and it is here where we can probably see the reasons behind some of the share price underperformance.\n\nManagement have already started to take steps to address the high debt levels with the sale of the Alaska business to Hilcorp for $5.6bn. This is a welcome start for a company whose gearing is now at 31.7%, and significantly above that of a year ago when it was at 27.1%. BP (LON: ) is planning up to another $5bn of disposals over the next couple of months to bring the total divestment amount to $10bn by year end, and help bring it into line with the rest of the industry between 25% and 30%.\n\nIn terms of renewables the company is already making strides, in July the company announced a new 50/50 joint venture with agricultural commodities company Bunge to produce sugarcane ethanol in Brazil.\n\nThe company also has a 43% stake in Lightsource BP (LON: ) which develops solar power, and which was purchased almost two years ago. Not only has it expanded its operations across Europe, as well as opening up in the US, Australia and Brazil, but it has also committed to spend $300m in investing in expanding in this particular area.\n\nBP (LON: ) also acquired the UK\u2019s largest electric vehicle charging network, Chargemaster just over a year ago, for \u00a3130m, a shrewd move for a company that has over 1,200 service stations around the country.\n\nThey also continued to make progress on its advanced mobility agenda, announcing an agreement with DiDi, to develop an electric vehicle charging network in China, the world\u2019s largest electrical vehicle market.\n\nWith renewables likely to become a growing part of the UK and the worlds energy needs, companies like BP (LON: ) have the financial clout to be able to deliver solutions quicker than governments, and with awareness surrounding climate issues rising as a result of the antics of organisations like Extinction Rebellion, the oil majors need to show that they are at the forefront of climate solutions.\n\nCurrently capital expenditure around renewables remains well below the levels allocated to big oil and gas projects, This needs to change, and it will be new CEO Bernard Looney\u2019s problem as to how he goes about tackling the issue of transitioning away from fossil fuels towards renewables.\n\nDISCLAIMER: CMC Markets is an execution-only provider.
