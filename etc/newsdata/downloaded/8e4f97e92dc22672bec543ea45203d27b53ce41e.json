When he initially looked at the market opportunities of the companies he invested in that would go on to be successful (Fitbit, Zynga, and SendGrid among then) he said that TAM was hard to discern. It could be zero, or it could be infinite.\n\nAs Feld explained to Harry Stebbings on a podcast episode of The Twenty Minute VC, looking at TAM isn't always helpful in a product-obsessed world \u2014 even if the startup seeks to replace an existing product.\n\n\"The interesting trajectory of that is that early in the life of a company, the product does matter a ton,\" Feld said. \"As the company starts to grow and develop, the great founding CEOs start to view the company itself as the product.\"\n\nIn situations where TAM is either zero or infinite, the founding CEOs are a good indicator of how the company will scale. Some companies can fall apart if the founding CEOs get distracted and fail to take steps to help the company grow; other CEOs are intensely charismatic, but their persona hides cracks within the company's foundation.\n\nReally good investors and entrepreneurs understand that the path to success is \"a combination of endless experiments,\" says Feld. Foundry Group does still do larger financings for more established startups, but Feld stressed that until a company has clearly demonstrated success, he doesn't want to saturate it with capital. Feld is attracted to companies that have founders who aren't trying to optimize huge valuations or huge amounts of capital in the short term.\n\nThe danger of overfunding companies at an early stage\n\nSo, the key to securing funding at an early stage from Feld involves more than making a case for potential market size. This contrasts with what's been said by investors like Scott Kupor of Andreessen Horowitz, who previously told Business Insider that market size was the first real priority question in their decision to invest at an early stage.\n\n\"That's just a function of the fact that we're wrong, unfortunately, more often than we're right on these things,\" Kupor said. \"We have to at least go into the decision at the outset thinking: 'OK, what could this be? If this is successful, how big can it be and what can it look like?'\"\n\nThe problem with operating from a futuristic perspective is overfunding a company. Feld holds back from investing in a company in earnest until it has clearly hit a success point.\n\nFeld would rather have multiple investment rounds through which he can invest at reasonable prices, rather than add an influx of capital into a company too early on at too high a price.\n\n\"The important thing from a venture perspective is not to respond one way or another to the availability or lack of availability of capital,\" Feld said, \"but to go back to this notion of what we need to do independent of what these characteristics around capital are to build a valuable business over a long period of time.\"", "description": "Venture capitalist Brad Feld, managing director of Foundry Group, doesn't use TAM as the primary factor to decide on an early-stage company.", "authors": ["Sherin Shibu"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da0ceb7cc4a0a04d82b3ee5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
