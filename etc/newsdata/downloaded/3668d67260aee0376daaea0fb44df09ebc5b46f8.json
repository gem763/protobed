The company explained that it was contacted by a VC-funded company for a \u201csecretive\u201d project that has been underway for five years. The only details provided through the blog post are that the face must be \u201ckind and friendly\u201d and that the resulting robot will act as a \u201cvirtual friend\u201d for elderly people, with potentially thousands of units going into production. Whoever wins the competition will get licensing fees of \u00a3100,000 (around $190,000).\n\nSo, pretty straightforward. I have some thoughts.\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s pretty clear to me that Mario is the front-runner, as he usually is, undeservedly. The guy jumps on a couple thousand Goombas or recklessly throws turtle shells at competitors in a go-kart race, and suddenly everyone\u2019s just fawning over him, yelling stuff like \u201cMario jumps, Luigi slumps!\u201d or \u201cLegalise Metal Mario!\u201d It\u2019s a cult of personality, ok? You should pick Luigi, and not just because he owes Bowser a lot of coins.\n\nHere is a short list of the most compelling reasons to choose Luigi:\n\nMario is very short. A tall robot with Mario\u2019s face would be an affront to human decency. A robot of any height featuring Luigi\u2019s face would look comparatively fine, as Luigi is already freakishly tall\n\nDuring the events of Luigi\u2019s Mansion, the real Luigi proved himself capable of many routine domestic tasks, such as vacuuming ghosts\n\nBroadens customer base, as he is not recognised as a serious threat by Koopas\n\nLuigi has a slightly more varied colour palette than Mario\n\nGood chance Nintendo won\u2019t even notice\n\nMario doesn\u2019t need the money. Luigi needs any help he can get\n\nI rest my case. Thank you, and please put Luigi\u2019s face on the terrifying metal man.", "description": "British engineering firm Geomiq is now accepting submissions from the public to be the literal face of a \u201cstate of the art humanoid\u201d robot slated for production in exchange for $190,000, CNET reported on Wednesday....", "authors": ["Ryan F.
