And if there is a general perception that the State can just call up Sam's phone records and see exactly who he is talking to without any problem, [it] has a chilling effect on our ability to get information,\" Sole said.\n\nThere was no costs order.", "description": "Investigative journalism centre amaBhungane has walked out of court victorious after successfully challenging parts of South Africa's surveillance law.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9241/a27a440cfbe94e90b71c23053ee61e04.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
