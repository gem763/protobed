It\u2019s a tiny speaker that you plug directly into a wall outlet, so you can get Alexa in every room of your house more easily. Amazon has built a full-sized USB port into the bottom of the $24.99 Echo Flex, so you can use it by your nightstand and still charge your phone, or even plug additional accessories into the Echo Flex.\n\nAmazon is announcing two Echo Flex accessories that you\u2019ll be able to slot into the bottom, a motion sensor and a night light. Both will be priced at $14.99, and since the Flex is clearly modular we\u2019ll likely see a lot more accessories in the future. Amazon is even building an API for software developers, and will share the specs for accessories in the future so others can build for the Flex. The first accessories are made by a company called Thirdreality.\n\nThe modular aspect of the Echo Flex is definitely the most interesting part. If Amazon can convince other hardware makers to create add-ons for the Flex then this could be a new way to move Alexa into controlling even more electronics in the home.\n\nThe Echo Flex is available for preorder today and should begin shipping mid November.", "description": "Amazon wants to make it easier to put Alexa in every part of your house with the Echo Flex.
