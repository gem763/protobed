The effort faced legal challenges, though the Supreme Court ruled in Trump\u2019s favor in July, allowing his administration to redirect the military funds.\n\nAfter being notified of the Pentagon\u2019s authorization on Tuesday, Schumer called the funding diversion a \u201cslap in the face to the members of the Armed Forces.\u201d\n\nTrump \u201cis willing to cannibalize already allocated military funding to boost his own ego, and for a wall he promised Mexico would pay to build.\u201d\n\nIt is a slap in the face to the members of the Armed Forces who serve our country that @realDonaldTrump is willing to cannibalize already allocated military funding to boost his own ego, and for a wall he promised Mexico would pay to build. https://t.co/sv2ys87bw1 \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) September 3, 2019", "description": "About 127 military construction projects within the U.S. and abroad will be affected by this diversion of funds to build Trump's wall along the Mexico bo...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6ee390240000ba027312f9.jpeg?cache=csn5z1w5fw&ops=1778_1000"}
