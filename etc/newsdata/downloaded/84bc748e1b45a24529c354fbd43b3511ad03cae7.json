The case count marks a surge from the 530 cases reported last week, and the 380 cases reported the week prior. The agency also reported 12 deaths linked to the illnesses.\n\nMany of the patients said they had vaped THC, but many also vaped both THC and nicotine. Some patients have said they only used e-cigarettes for nicotine products, but health officials have noted that some patients are hesitant to disclose THC use. Health officials still have not identified a culprit or culprits behind the recent spate of illnesses.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is a complex investigation and I don\u2019t think that we should expect definitive answers imminently.

She also noted that the data collection needed for the investigation is reliant on \u201cantiquated systems,\u201d which has slowed the process down.\n\nThe illnesses have escalated an ongoing conversation about the potential health risks related to e-cigarette use. They have also sparked legislative action to rein in vaping, particularly among young people. On Tuesday, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker issued a four-month ban on the sale of all vaping products in the state. And on Wednesday, Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo issued a temporary ban on flavored vaping products.", "description": "Forty-six states and the U.S. Virgin Islands have now reported cases of the illness.
