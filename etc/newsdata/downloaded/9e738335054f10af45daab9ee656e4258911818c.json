They did not care about the terrible impact that abolishing freedom of movement will have on recruiting to our public services, especially the NHS, as well as the effects on our businesses and our universities. After all, this is the prime minister who famously said, \u201cF*** business\u201d.\n\nBut they did have to take account of the law. And there is no law which has been passed by parliament to remove freedom of movement. Unless and until that happens \u2013 and Labour and other opposition parties have voted repeatedly against the Tories\u2019 Immigration Bill \u2013 the current law stands, which is to allow EU citizens their treaty rights.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

And the practical effect of removing these rights is not just devastating to the many people involved, but is a gigantic act of self-harm. As my colleague John McDonnell said in another context, this government offers a unique combination of right-wing extremism and bumbling incompetence.\n\nWe should be clear that we have all benefited from freedom of movement. It has helped to recruit to our chronically understaffed NHS and other public services, and workers with all types of skills have contributed to our economy as well as to our cultural and social life. The public finances have been boosted. It is often forgotten that many immigrants create jobs themselves by establishing or expanding businesses.\n\nWhat is certain is that we should do nothing which makes us worse off. Clearly, that means opposing no-deal Brexit. But it also means honouring the commitments we have already made to all the EU citizens who have come here. And not making any changes to our immigration system that will make them or us worse off.\n\nThis is not the approach of this government. It will continue to make false, unworkable promises on curbing immigration. The aim is not to deliver on the promises, any more than the promise to cut net migration to under 100,000 annually has ever been met. It is instead to permanently rail against foreigners and migrants.\n\nWe are told that the government intends to run a grotesque racist, xenophobic election campaign, which they insultingly call a \u201cnorthern strategy\u201d, as if all northerners share the Tories\u2019 racism.\n\nThey don\u2019t. We will fight this obvious scapegoating, which is only trying to avoid responsibility for a crisis of the Tories\u2019 own making. And we will win, by matching unity and prosperity against division and racism.\n\nWe need a government that rejects this ugly division. We need a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn.", "description": "It\u2019s been easy to overlook in all the headlines about the coup and blocking no-deal Brexit, but the Tories have been forced to make a screeching U-turn on their immigration policy.
