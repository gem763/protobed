Today\u2019s circumstances are in substance the same as Saturday\u2019s circumstances,\u201d Bercow told parliament.\n\n\u201cMy ruling is therefore that the motion will not be debated today as it would be repetitive and disorderly to do so,\u201d Bercow said, provoking the ire of Brexit supporting lawmakers who said they had been refused a chance to vote on Johnson\u2019s deal.\n\nBercow said the government could still secure ratification for the Brexit deal by Oct. 31 if it had the numbers in parliament. Johnson was disappointed by the decision, a spokesman said.\n\nBut the speaker\u2019s decision means that the government will have to try to push on with the legislation needed for ratification, a process opponents are plotting to wreck with amendments that would destroy Johnson\u2019s deal.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, said the government wanted the lower house of parliament to finish voting on the bill on Thursday, before it heads to the upper house, which also has to approve it before the Brexit deadline.\n\n\u201cTrying to ram through legislation of this complexity, significance and long lasting consequences in just 3 days is an abomination of scrutiny and democracy,\u201d said Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the Scottish National Party.\n\nSterling GBP=D3 traded at around $1.30, unaffected by the speaker's move.\n\nAMBUSH\n\nJohnson was ambushed in parliament on Saturday by opponents who demanded a change to the sequencing of the ratification of the deal, exposing the prime minister to a law which forced him to request a delay until Jan. 31.\n\nHe sent the note to the European Union unsigned - and added another signed letter arguing against what he said was a deeply corrosive delay.\n\nBrexit Secretary Steve Barclay said European Council President Donald Tusk had accepted the delay request as valid and was considering it.\n\nThe European Union, which has grappled with the Brexit crisis since Britons voted 52%-48% to leave in a 2016 referendum, decided on Sunday to play for time rather than rush to decide on Johnson\u2019s request for a delay.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks at the House of Commons as parliament discusses Brexit, sitting on a Saturday for the first time since the 1982 Falklands War, in London, Britain, October 19, 2019, in this screen grab taken from video.

Parliament will vote in the second reading on legislation known as the Withdrawal Agreement Bill on Tuesday, after which amendments can be proposed to it.\n\nJohnson\u2019s ministers said they were confident they had the numbers to push a deal through parliament, though there was concern that amendments could wreck Johnson\u2019s deal.\n\nCRITICISM\n\nThe opposition Labour Party is planning changes to the legislation needed for Brexit that would make the deal unacceptable to swathes of Johnson\u2019s own party \u2014 including a proposal for another referendum.\n\nBercow\u2019s decision provoked criticism from Brexit supporters.\n\n\u201cIt is becoming remarkable how often you please one lot and not the other lot,\u201d Bernard Jenkin, a pro-Brexit Conservative Party lawmaker, told parliament.\n\nBercow dismissed such criticism, saying his decision was honorable and based on a long-standing convention in the House of Commons.\n\n\u201cHe is grumbling now because he doesn\u2019t like the judgment,\u201d Bercow said of Jenkin. \u201cIf the government have got the numbers, the government can have their way.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement Bill enshrines the Brexit deal, known as the Withdrawal Agreement in British law and must be passed before the treaty is considered to be ratified.\n\nPrevious bills to implement major European treaties have taken between 10 and 40 sitting days to get through parliament, according to the Institute of Government.\n\nA spokesman for Johnson said that if the legislation strayed too far from the deal then its ratification would be placed in question.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces a potentially perilous ratification of his Brexit divorce deal in the British parliament after the speaker refused to allow a vote on it on Monday.", "authors": ["Kylie Maclellan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443320675&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0E6", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
