To which I say, \u201cFeh!\u201d In this house, the only Christmas creep we choose to acknowledge is Paul Giamatti in Fred Claus. Christmas comes but once a year, and that \u201conce\u201d happens to last for two entire months. Did your landlord turn the heat on in your building? Surprise! It\u2019s Christmas now.\n\nTwo prime offenders of the Christmas-creep agenda are dueling women-focused cable channels, Lifetime and Hallmark, which over the years have ramped up their made-for-TV holiday-romance output to near\u2013Santa\u2019s Workshop levels. This year, Lifetime\u2019s 24/7 Christmas-content schedule is called \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Lifetime\u201d and will feature 30 new features. Hallmark had so much Christmas content it had to split it over two channels: Hallmark and its sister channel, Hallmark Movies & Mysteries. Hallmark will also have 24/7 Christmas programming, and both channels combined will feature 40 new Christmas films.\n\nThen there\u2019s Netflix, which has had some of the least-disposable Christmas content of late with films like The Christmas Switch and A Christmas Prince. And to round out the wintry landscape, there are a couple of theatrical releases and a Disney+ film in the mix. So start your Advent calendar early: here\u2019s what to watch, and when, sorted by holiday-movie trope.\n\nLet\u2019s Create the Perfect Conditions for Intimacy Using a \u2026 Snowstorm!\n\nLet It Snow (Netflix, November 8): This YA Christmas rom-com is based on the book by John Green, Maureen Johnson, and Laureen Myracle, and it\u2019s packing three teen holiday love stories in one. It\u2019s a mini-anthology! There\u2019s no trailer yet, but the description says, \u201cA snowstorm hits a small town on a cold Christmas Eve, affecting the friendships, love lives and futures of several high school seniors.\u201d Netflix\u2019s No. 1 Teen Kiernan Shipka is one of the several, as is Odeya Rush. Will she play a mean girl like in Lady Bird? A nice girl like in Dumplin\u2019? Actually, this movie looks too cute and frictionless to have a mean character. Also: Joan Cusack stars as, I don\u2019t know, \u201cAdult.\u201d\n\nGrounded for Christmas (Lifetime, December 8 at 8 p.m.): Not every arrogant but charming pilot can be Rob Lowe. Some have to be named Brady (Corey Sevier) and have a winter storm ground them in Cleveland. Fellow pilot Nina (Julianna Guill) has family in the area, though, and invites Brady to stay with her at her parents\u2019 house. The catch? He has to pretend to be her boyfriend, because her parents are hosting a tree-trimming party and they invited Nina\u2019s ex. Psychopathic!\n\nGet Thee to Your Hometown Holiday Concert\n\nPhoto: Hallmark\n\nA Christmas Love Story, From the Hallmark Hall of Fame (Hallmark, December 7 at 8 p.m.): This is not a drill! Kristin Chenoweth is starring in a Christmas movie! She plays a youth-choir director who falls in love with Scott Wolf, who plays the widowed father of a talented teen singer. Finally, they\u2019re putting the Kristin back in Christmas.\n\nA Christmas Winter Song (Lifetime, December 14 at 8 p.m.): Ashanti(!!!!!!) stars as Clio, a Christmas-shop owner who befriends Fred (Stan Shaw), a homeless jazz singer. Clio helps Fred reconnect with his daughter and grandkids, \u201cjust in time for the town\u2019s annual Christmas concert.\u201d Of all the Christmas concerts in all the Christmas towns in all the holiday movies, we\u2019re sure Ashanti\u2019s will be one of the best.\n\nIntimacy via Snowstorm and a Hometown Holiday Concert\n\nSweet Mountain Christmas (Lifetime, October 25 at 8 p.m.): Well, it\u2019s all downhill from here, folks. How can you possibly beat a Lifetime movie starring the original Bombshell herself, Megan Hilty, as a country star named Laney Blu? This movie takes the \u201cfreak snowstorm\u201d route to stranding its too-big-for-her-britches protagonist in her Tennessee hometown. With nowhere to go, she gets roped into performing in the town\u2019s holiday concert, and falls for a \u2014 oh my God \u2014 hunky snowplow driver (Marcus Rosner). Mr. Plow, indeed! If the cable holiday-movie lineup were a chess game, this would be a very strategic opening gambit.\n\nThe Road Home for Christmas (Lifetime, October 26 at 8 p.m.): The central couple in this one is Lindsay (Marla Sokoloff) and Wes (Rob Mayes), who are rival, dueling pianists! Let that sink in! They go on a road trip, perform with Marie Osmond in Nashville, and \u2014 yes \u2014 brave a \u201cmassive snowstorm.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a Profession Both Romantic and Festive to Own and/or Work in a Small Shop\n\nA Merry Christmas Match (Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, October 25 at 9 p.m.): In the first all-new original holiday movie of the 2019 season, Kyle Dean Massey (of having-played-both-Pippin-and-Fiyero-on-Broadway fame) sweeps antique-shop worker Corey (Ashley Newbrough) off her feet.\n\nNostalgic Christmas (Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, October 31 at 9 p.m.): Infraction A: Find me a lazier Hallmark movie title. \u201cNostalgic Christmas??\u201d Hon, you can\u2019t just name your movie after two IMDB keywords. And infraction B is that it airs on Halloween! It\u2019s one thing to start airing Christmas movies three weeks into October, but the only Christmas fare that\u2019s acceptable All Hallow\u2019s Eve viewing is crossover event The Nightmare Before Christmas. Or Polar Express, because those dead-eyed mo-cap Tom Hankses are spooky. Anyway, it\u2019s about a woman (Brooke D\u2019Orsay) who is nostalgic at Christmas about her father\u2019s toy store. Fine.\n\nAlways and Forever Christmas (Lifetime, November 3 at 8 p.m.): Sadly, this is not an Alyssa Edwards Christmas movie. Happily, it is a movie about a marketing exec (Lexi Lawson) who plans on selling her grandfather\u2019s year-round Christmas store \u201cto a hip athletic-leisurewear company.\u201d Finally, a Lifetime Original that addresses the absolute epidemic of Athleta and Outdoor Voices locations wiping out this nation\u2019s year-round mom-and-pop Christmas stores. There\u2019s also a hunky local diner owner, Scott (Mark Ghanime), and a magical \u201cChristmas stranger\u201d (is this a thing?) from the North Pole (Beth Broderick).\n\nLast Christmas (in theaters November 8): Look, few cinematic experiences in this life are as sublime as London-set Christmastime rom-coms with phenomenal soundtracks and Emma Thompson. Rom-coms starring Henry Golding as a romantic lead with Michelle Yeoh going above and beyond in a supporting role come close, though. And then there\u2019s Paul Feig\u2019s latest film, Last Christmas, which has all of the above. Emilia Clarke stars as a disillusioned department-store elf with an angelic voice who meets the too-good-to-be-true Golding in London. Yeoh is her boss, Thompson is her mom, and the supporting cast is rounded out by Patti LuPone, Peter Serafinowicz, and Rob Delaney. On top of it all, the soundtrack is wall-to-wall George Michael and Wham! If you don\u2019t go see this in theaters and do your part to save the endangered species that is the rom-com, I may never forgive you.\n\nA Sweet Christmas Romance (Lifetime, November 10 at 8 p.m.): Bakery owner Mrs. Rose (Loretta Devine) is retiring, and she\u2019s decided to take estate-law advice from Willy Wonka, Esq.: She\u2019ll host a 12 Days of Christmas contest to see who can re-create her Christmas recipes. Sure! Food stylist Holly (Adelaide Kane) throws her toque in the ring \u201cdespite not being much of a cook,\u201d which begs the question: Can Lifetime just name multiple female protagonists across different movies in one year Holly? I get that it\u2019s a very Christmas-y name, but is that allowed? Who cares. Holly competes and falls in love with local hunky baker Brad (Greyston Holt. Greyston. Greyston. Greyston Holt. Now that is a name).\n\nA Very Vintage Christmas (Lifetime, November 27 at 8 p.m.): Tia Mowry-Hardrict stars without Tamera on a rival network as Very Vintage Antiques shop owner Dodie. When Dodie finds a hidden box full of old mementos from one couple\u2019s \u201ctimeless romantic union,\u201d she sets out with hunky new tenant Edward (Jesse Hutch) to find its rightful owners, forging a romantic union of her own.\n\nCan a Christmas Miracle Save Capitalism?\n\nChristmas Wishes & Mistletoe Kisses (Hallmark, October 26 at 8 p.m.): Wait, you mean to tell me this movie has Christmas wishes and mistletoe kisses? In this climate? Slant rhymes aside, this movie follows single mom Abbey (Jill Wagner), who \u201ctakes a risk in following her true passion of interior designing.\u201d So brave! But can she design hunky eligible businessman Nick\u2019s estate in time for Christmas Eve? Matthew Davis plays Nick. He\u2019s Warner from Legally Blonde. That\u2019s huge!\n\nMerry & Bright (Hallmark, November 2 at 8 p.m.): Kind of like Desk Set if Katherine Hepburn played the middle child on Full House, this one follows Cate (Jodie Sweetin), the CEO of a candy-cane company, who begins to fall for Gabe (Andrew Walker). He\u2019s posing as her arranged suitor but is really a consultant from Empire Corporate Recovery looking to streamline and elevate candy-cane production. Will they save the business? Do you even have to ask?\n\nChristmas \u00e0 la Mode (Lifetime, November 15 at 8 p.m.): Emily White (Katie Leclerc) loves running her late father\u2019s deeply unprofitable dairy farm. It\u2019s a real choice to put all your chips on dairy, of all things, in 2019, and it seems like Emily\u2019s sister, Dorothy, realizes this. Dorothy brings in hunky business partner Charlie (Ryan Cooper) to propose they sell the farm, unless Emily can buy it out by Christmas Eve. Her strategy is to \u201chold an online holiday-ice-cream-flavor contest that goes viral with the help of a key ingredient, Charlie\u2019s amazing apple pie. Christmas \u00e0 la Mode ice cream is born!\u201d Lifetime. Girl. You need to be doing five fewer things with this movie. It\u2019s somehow so much and so little, all at once.\n\nChristmas Under the Stars (Hallmark, November 16 at 9 p.m.): Ooh, finally one of those raunchy, racy, 9 p.m. Hallmark Christmas movies. Maybe they regularly pull that kind of thing over on Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, but round these parts? Scandal! This one\u2019s about a hotshot finance guy who gets fired at Christmas and takes a job at a Christmas-tree lot. There he meets \u201cJulie, an astronomy teacher who\u2019s always looked to the stars for hope.\u201d With his business savvy and her, um, knowledge of constellations, will they help the kindly widower who owns the lot?\n\nChristmas at the Plaza (Hallmark, November 29 at 8 p.m.): We looked up December availabilities, and spending Christmas at the Plaza is gonna cost you $995 a night, and that\u2019s at the absolute lowest. And besides, there\u2019s already been a TV movie about Christmas at the Plaza: It\u2019s called Eloise at Christmastime and Julie Andrews plays Nanny!\n\nSense, Sensibility & Snowmen (Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, November 29 at 9 p.m.): Gosh, Hallmark. Way to come for the artistic integrity of 2009 parody novel (aren\u2019t you glad this trend is over?) Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters. This Christmas flick transposes Austen\u2019s novel very loosely onto modern-day Chicago, where Edward (Luke Macfarlane) runs a toy company but is generally a grump. Sisters Elinor (now Ella, played by Erin Krakow) and Marianne (Kimberly Sustad) are \u201cChristmas-enthusiast party planners.\u201d At one point in the preview clips, Edward tips his hat and says \u201cM\u2019lady\u2019\u201d and it\u2019s played straight. That\u2019s some Joker-meme-account energy right there.\n\nYou Light Up My Christmas (Lifetime, December 1 at 8 p.m.): Because one movie about a family-owned Christmas-light factory wasn\u2019t enough, You Light Up My Christmas follows Emma (Kim Fields) to her hometown where the holiday lights have gone dim. Inspired by true events, no less.\n\nA Storybook Christmas (Lifetime, December 6 at 8 p.m.): Event planner and very involved aunt Celeste Everett (Ali Liebert) hires a Christmas nanny (Jake Epstein) who becomes a Christmas boyfriend. If the name Ali Liebert jingles a bell, it\u2019s because she\u2019s also starring in Hallmark\u2019s Cherished Memories: A Gift to Remember 2.\n\nThe Christmas Temp (Lifetime, December 20 at 8 p.m.): \u201cAn out-of-work artist discovers a special Christmas temp agency that matches her with a handful of festive jobs \u2026\u201d Let me stop you right there, Lifetime synopsis. I\u2019ll take it. Perfect. A fantasy. Employment? I\u2019m in. Wait \u2014 \u201c\u2026 but falls into a creative rut while juggling holiday preparations and feelings for the agency\u2019s HR manager.\u201d No! You were so close, The Christmas Temp! An HR manager violating HR protocol? Mess!\n\nEnchanted Holiday Objects and Similarly Enchanting Strangers\n\nTwo Turtle Doves (Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, November 1 at 9 p.m.): Dr. Sharon Hayes (Nikki DeLoach) \u201csearches for a beloved family heirloom in a small Christmas town.\u201d What is a \u201cChristmas town?\u201d I\u2019ll tell you: It\u2019s a place where a grieving doctor can fall in love with Michael Rady. Kostas! Kostas from Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants! You\u2019ve seen him in a deep-V, now check him out in a scarf!\n\nA Godwink Christmas: Meant for Love (Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, November 15 at 9 p.m.): Married Christian writers Squire Rushnell and Louise DuArt executive-produced this Hallmark movie with Kathie Lee Gifford. It\u2019s a sequel to their 2018 movie A Godwink Christmas, which was based on their Godwink book series and brand identity, which is based on a term Rushnell copyrighted, which basically means a coincidence, only, um, godlier. Get it? God winks!\n\nThe Knight Before Christmas (Netflix, November 21): Poor Vanessa Hudgens. Girl can\u2019t celebrate a normal Christmas in peace without some big British disturbance coming along to change her fate. First it was her Parent Trap\u2013style performance in Netflix\u2019s The Christmas Switch, and now it\u2019s happened again in The Knight Before Christmas. The gist: Brooke (Vanessa Hudgens) is a science teacher \u201cwho\u2019s disillusioned by love.\u201d Sir Cole (Josh Whitehouse) is a medieval knight who gets sent by a witch\u2019s curse to present-day Ohio. The rest will probably follow a Kate & Leopold tack, with Sir Cole teaching Brooke that chivalry isn\u2019t dead and that science is a lie and that big, lit-up Christmas trees are for pagans. Brooke will teach Cole how to use a Roku.\n\nThe Magical Christmas Shoes (Lifetime, November 22 at 8 p.m.): Have you ever watched Tiny Fuppets? It\u2019s a web series by Scott Gairdner about a Portuguese rip-off of Muppet Babies. I think it\u2019s meant to parody those disturbingly low-budget straight-to-DVD rip-offs of Pixar movies that used to abound in sales bins to fool and confuse well-meaning grandmothers. Anyway. Everything in the world of Tiny Fuppets is ever so slightly off. Kermit and Miss Piggy are replaced by Kormit and Ms. Woman. The dialogue is stilted and the eyes are dead. The Magical Christmas Shoes sounds like an episode of Tiny Fuppets.\n\nThe Christmas Club (Hallmark, November 27 at 8 p.m.): \u201cTwo busy strangers\u201d (not to be confused with Three Busy Debras) fall in love \u201cthanks to fate and Christmas magic\u201d when they \u201chelp an elderly woman find her lost Christmas savings.\u201d The main character\u2019s name is Olivia Bennett (Cameron Mitchell). We think it\u2019s written by algorithm. Hallmark says it\u2019s based on a novel by Barbara Hinske. We think Barbara Hinske must, therefore, be an algorithm.\n\nA Christmas Wish (Lifetime, November 28 at 8 p.m.) Faith (Hilarie Burton) puts a wish to find true love in her town\u2019s Christmas wishing box and thinks it might have come true when she meets \u201cthe very handsome and eligible Andrew\u201d (Cristian de la Fuente). But then she wonders if her Christmas wish was really leading her to her best friend Wyatt (Tyler Hilton) all along. This is set in the \u201csmall town of Ponchatoula, Louisiana,\u201d making it a Louisiana Christmas, if not the Louisiana Christmas.\n\nA Date by Christmas Eve (Lifetime, December 22 at 8 p.m.): \u201cWhen Chelsea Simms, the good-hearted brand strategist\u201d (I\u2019m listening \u2026) \u201cfor the popular dating app The Nice List\u201d (Go on \u2026) \u201chas granted her magical powers \u2014\u201d SAY NO MORE. Black Mirror is absolutely shaking.\n\nLetter Writing Is Hot and Aspirational\n\nHoliday for Heroes (Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, November 8 at 9 p.m.): Marc Blucas, who once dramatically left Buffy in a helicopter, plays a soldier who exchanges letters for a year with coffee-shop owner Melissa Claire Egan before they I guess meet for realsies on Christmas? Patti Murin plays \u201cPam!\u201d Can\u2019t wait for this, by which I mean I can\u2019t wait for Patti Murin as \u201cPam,\u201d specifically. This title is very misleading because there\u2019s only one true \u201choliday for heroes,\u201d and that\u2019s the Olsen twins\u2019 birthday.\n\nWrite Before Christmas (Hallmark, November 17 at 8 p.m.): Jessica (Torrey DeVitto) is single and sending out Christmas cards to people who matter to her, including \u201ca pop star (Drew Seeley) who was part of the soundtrack of her life.\u201d Considering the open secret that Drew Seeley did the vocals for Zac Efron in the first High School Musical, he was definitely part of the soundtrack of so many of our lives. Chad Michael Murray is second billed, but his role isn\u2019t specified in the promo materials. Guess it\u2019s just another one of those classic Mistletoe Secrets\u2122.\n\nChristmas Love Letter (Lifetime, December 21 at 6 p.m.): Relationship-advice columnist Amalie Hess (Ashley Newbrough) receives an unsigned love letter and tries to track it down in her hometown. There\u2019s a floofy Westie dog in the promo stills, so, you know, points for that.\n\nSexy Amnesia\n\nCherished Memories: A Gift to Remember 2 (Hallmark, November 24 at 8 p.m.): We all have cherished memories of 2017 Hallmark TV movie A Gift to Remember 1, starring Peter Porte as mysterious-yet-charming amnesiac Aidan and Ali Liebert as the woman who caused the accident and falls in love with him. No, wait. That was While You Were Sleeping. Whatever! We\u2019ve been on tenterhooks for two years, clamoring for more, but finally, everyone\u2019s favorite franchise is back, baby, now with 100 percent more cherished memories.\n\nChristmas On My Mind (Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, December 19 at 9 p.m.): Cullen vampire clan member Ashley Greene plays Lucy, who wakes up with a wedding dress in hand and no memory of the past two years. She tries to regain her memory with the help of ex-boyfriend Zac, played by Andrew Walker, the same Andrew Walker who plays the candy-cane fixer suit in Merry & Bright. Jackee Harry plays a doctor. Sounds like a wintry 50 First Dates.\n\nJournalism Is a Job Some People Do, Even at Christmas\n\nThe Mistletoe Secret (Hallmark, November 10 at 8 p.m.): Country-music artist Kellie Pickler plays a woman who convinces a travel writer to profile her hometown, only to be torn between him and his ghostwriter. The \u201cmistletoe secret\u201d in question is either a deep-buried collective trauma shared by the townspeople from their dark past \u2026 Or it\u2019s the whole ghostwriter thing.\n\nThat\u2019s Tamera, not Tia Photo: Hallmark\n\nA Christmas Miracle (Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, November 14 at 9 p.m.): Tamera Mowry-Housley stars without Tia in what is shockingly the first movie about a writer at a lifestyle magazine on this list. When tasked with writing a story about a Christmas miracle, \u201cever-optimistic single mom Emma Sanderson\u201d decides to make one herself for a lonely street musician. Brooks Darnell plays her office love interest.\n\nRandom Acts of Christmas (Lifetime, November 17 at 8 p.m.): Okay, the name of this one made me laugh out loud. Investigative journalist Sydney (Erin Cahill) and competing reporter Cole (Kevin McGarry) fall in love while sussing out who is behind the \u201crandom acts of Christmas\u201d popping up all over town. And they say the rom-com is dead!\n\nChristmas 9 to 5 (Lifetime, November 24 at 8 p.m.): \u201cJennifer (Tiya Sircar) is a tough crime-beat reporter who gets the assignment of her life: to find the true meaning of Christmas.\u201d Reader, I laughed out loud.\n\nSanta Is Real\n\nNoelle (Disney+, November 12): In what looks to be one of the more promising Disney+ launch-day offerings, Anna Kendrick stars as Santa Claus\u2019s daughter Noelle Kringle, whose brother Nick (Bill Hader) ditches Santa-ing to teach yoga somewhere warm. Oh, and Shirley MacLaine is low-key third-billed as a sassy elf? This looks like a decently cute Christmas movie. Maybe not Elf-level legend status, but it has Bill Hader looking adorable while drinking hot chocolate in a big fluffy Santa coat.\n\nKlaus (Netflix, November 15): Santa Claus origin story Klaus is Netflix\u2019s first original animated feature, and it looks gorgeous. The film is directed by former Disney animator Sergio Pablos and appears to be a blend between traditional, hand-drawn character design and computer-enabled light and texture effects. Klaus seems like a very smart acquisition for Netflix, considering it\u2019s releasing it right around the time that Disney+ launches. Disney+ has based a lot of its branding on the animation studio\u2019s classics, but the majority of its original programming appears to be live action and not traditional animation. If Klaus is a hit and Netflix continues releasing more original animated features, it can maintain its status as a top-tier family streaming service. That\u2019s a lot of pressure on a grumpy proto-Santa voiced by J.K. Simmons and his delivery-boy assistant voiced by Jason Schwartzman. (This clip gives an extra glimpse into the latter character, whom Schwartzman plays as kind of an Emperor Kuzco.) Netflix is also giving Klaus an awards-qualifying limited release in select theaters on November 8, if you\u2019ve been starved for half-interesting-looking animation since Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse.\n\nIt\u2019s 2019 and Apparently There\u2019s This Thing Called Hanukkah Now?\n\nDouble Holiday (Hallmark, November 26 at 8 p.m.): When I began compiling this list, I couldn\u2019t find a description for the film on Hallmark\u2019s website, but the movie\u2019s IMDB page listed characters named Sara and Ruth Hoffman, so I imagined that the \u201cdouble holiday\u201d in question was a nod to the last night of Hanukkah falling on Christmas Eve, forcing an interfaith couple to go to both family celebrations. Well, Hallmark eventually released the plot and I was so close: \u201cFate has brought Rebecca and her arch-nemesis, Chris, close as they have to throw a holiday party at the office. It so happens that the dates coincide with Hanukkah!\u201d Hallmark, please please please please let me write that other movie for you. It will make my Jewish mother so proud.\n\nMistletoe & Menorahs (Lifetime, December 7 at 6 p.m.): It\u2019s a Lifetime Romantic Lead Jake Epstein Double Feature, folks! Epstein plays Jonathan, who is \u201cin desperate need of turning his bachelor pad into a Christmas Wonderland to impress his girlfriend\u2019s father.\u201d But wait: He\u2019s Jewish! Luckily, toy company exec Christy (Kelley Jakle) needs Jonathan to teach her all about Hanukkah to help her land a big account. What\u2019s a Hanukkah account need a toy company for? What\u2019s she gonna do, reinvent the dreidel? (Just saying, cable networks: I\u2019m still available to do punch-up on your Hanukkah scripts.)\n\nWhat If Christmas Happened in Other Countries? It\u2019s More Likely Than You Think.\n\nHoliday in the Wild (Netflix, November 1): Kristin Davis plays a Manhattanite whose husband leaves her, forcing her to take their romantic safari second honeymoon all by herself. (It\u2019s a very Trey MacDougal move.) Davis isn\u2019t alone for long, though, once she meets a handsome bush-plane pilot played by Rob Lowe. Together, they save a baby elephant and celebrate Christmas at an elephant orphanage. Hallmark who? Lifetime what? Netflix has those baby elephant dollars.\n\nChristmas in Rome (Hallmark, November 30 at 8 p.m.): Whatever Lacey wants, Lacey gets. If Hallmark Channel crown jewel Lacey Chabert wants to film on location in Rome, Hallmark will Film. On. Location. In. Rome. \u201cI kind of feel like Rome plays a character in this movie.\u201d Lacey Chabert said that, about the movie Christmas in Rome.\n\nA Christmas Prince: The Royal Baby (Netflix, December 5): There are generally two kinds of Netflix original films: There are the ones that feel like movie-movies, like the kind you\u2019d log on Letterboxd; these are often, but not always, actual cinematic releases. And then there are the ones that feel undeniably like made-for-TV, direct-to-VOD movies. Even though both types are technically direct-to-streaming, movies like the Christmas Prince saga really lean in to that Hallmark rerun, $5 DVD bin at RiteAid feel. Rose McIver plays Amber, an all-American girl who fell in love with her onetime interview subject, now King of Aldovia, Richard (Ben Lamb). It\u2019s kind of funny how for every major event in Meghan Markle\u2019s life, Netflix has responded accordingly with its blonde alternate-universe Meghan: 2018 saw royal weddings for both England and Aldovia, and now in 2019, Queen Amber is having a Royal Christmas Baby. Hopefully, 2020 brings us A Christmas Prince: Aldovian Tabloid Lawsuit.\n\nHot Single Dads\n\nPhoto: Hallmark\n\nPicture a Perfect Christmas (Hallmark, November 9 at 8 p.m.): This is a play on words of \u201cpicture-perfect Christmas,\u201d which is close enough to being a real thing, and because the main character \u2014 yes \u2014 takes pictures. An extreme-sports photographer (Merritt Patterson) goes home to care for her grandmother and ends up engaging in the extremest sport of all: love!\n\nMerry Happy Whatever (Netflix, November 28): Dennis Quaid and Ashley Tisdale, a meeting of the greats. This Netflix seasonal release isn\u2019t a movie; it\u2019s an eight-episode, holiday-specific anthology series that\u2019s also a multi-cam sitcom. If I were streaming service Disney+, I\u2019d be steamed that I had to go out and find all-new singing teens for that confusing High School Musical reboot while Netflix has Christmas offerings with both Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Tisdale.\n\nStaging Christmas (Lifetime, November 29 at 8 p.m.): Wealthy widower Elliot (George Stults) hires home stager Lori (Soleil Moon Frye) to stage his home, not because he\u2019s putting it on the market but because he wants to cheer up his daughter, Maddie. Because kids love home stagings!\n\nHot Single Dads in the Exciting World of Radio!\n\nRadio Christmas (Lifetime, November 9 at 8 p.m.): Kara Porter (Keshia Knight Pulliam) is a radio DJ in the little town of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, who \u201cseeks to uncover the identity of the town\u2019s Secret Santa, an anonymous benefactor that saved all of Bethlehem\u2019s Christmas festivities.\u201d She\u2019s also falling for a handsome single dad with a cute daughter. Might they be one and the same? Yeah.\n\nHoliday Rush (Netflix, November 28): Single dad Rashon \u201cRush\u201d Williams (Romany Malco) loses his radio-DJ gig right around the holidays \u2026 just in time for his four spoiled kids to give him their wish lists. His producer and aunt agree to help him buy another station if he and his family can learn to pare back their riche lifestyle. Feels like there\u2019s gotta be an easier way to get a job in radio than buying a whole station, but sure. Whatever works. If Melanie Griffith in Working Girl taught us anything, it\u2019s acquiring radio is a real head-for-business move. La La Anthony guests, because Netflix knows what we want.\n\nOld Hometown Flames\n\nChristmas Scavenger Hunt (Hallmark, November 3 at 8 p.m.): Belinda (Kim Shaw) is teamed up with her ex, Dustin (Kevin McGarry), for her hometown\u2019s Christmas scavenger hunt. From there, we can only hope things take a Belinda Blinked turn for the steamy.\n\nChristmas in Louisiana (Lifetime, November 16 at 8 p.m.): Christmas in Louisiana has as rich and deep a mythology as Westeros, with much less bloodshed and much more zydeco holiday music, presumably. So there\u2019s the Winter family, see, and they\u2019re kind of like the Starks of New Iberia, Louisiana. They\u2019re \u201cChristmas royalty.\u201d Daughter and scion to the Winter Family Christmas legacy is Sarah (Jan Kramer), a former Miss Christmas, which Lifetime assures you is a very, very big deal. She returns for the town\u2019s Sugarcane Christmas Festival and \u201crediscovers the magic of the season\u201d with her former Mister Christmas, Luke (Percy Daggs III).\n\nHoliday Hearts (Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, November 21 at 9 p.m.): In a description almost as AutoFill-sounding as Nostalgic Christmas, Holiday Hearts follows Peyton (Ashley Williams) and Ben (Paul Campbell) who have to plan an annual Christmas party, find Christmas spirit, find love, and care for a friend\u2019s daughter.\n\nTurkey Drop (Freeform, November 23 at 9 p.m.): Freeform\u2019s not like the other girls; she\u2019s different. She\u2019s got a Thanksgiving movie. Olivia Holt plays a freshman who \u201creturns home to her small town for Thanksgiving break and suspects she\u2019s about to get turkey dropped \u2014 a.k.a. dumped by her high-school sweetheart.\u201d Cheryl Hines is in this in some capacity!\n\nChristmas Unleashed (Lifetime, December 7 at 8 p.m.): Marla\u2019s (Vanessa Lachey) dog runs away on Christmas Eve, so her ex-boyfriend Max (Christopher Russell) helps her track him down through their North Carolina town. Spoiler alert: They\u2019ll definitely find the dog and near-definitely rediscover each other.\n\nRediscovering Christmas (Lifetime, December 15 at 8 p.m.): Big-city department-store window-dresser Mia (Jessica Lowndes) has just about had it with Christmas, having designed holiday windows for months. She plans on spending Christmas in the tropics, until her sister pulls her into planning their Vermont hometown\u2019s \u201cannual Snowflake festival.\u201d Lifetime really buries the lede in its blurb for this one, because it fails to mention that Jessica Walter co-stars as someone named Mrs. Barrington.\n\n(Mostly) Country Singers\n\nA Homecoming for the Holidays (Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, December 5 at 9 p.m.): Charlotte (Laura Osnes) is a country singer. Matt (Stephen Huszar) is an ex-soldier. Can I make it any more obvious? She\u2019s working on an album, and together they build a house for a friend. The overlap in Nielsen households that enjoy home-reno shows and Hallmark Christmas movies is probably massive, so this was a shrewd and brilliant call.\n\nTime for You to Come Home for Christmas (Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, December 6 at 9 p.m.): The title sounds like something Yule demon Krampus chants before he kills you, but it\u2019s actually just a Blake Shelton joint! He executive-produced 2018\u2019s Time for Me to Come Home for Christmas, based on his song \u201cTime for Me to Come Home\u201d from his 2012 Christmas album, Cheers It\u2019s Christmas. This one is about a Christmas dance for military families. That doesn\u2019t make the title any less menacing, though.\n\nChristmas at Dollywood (Hallmark, December 8 at 8 p.m.): I get that this title made sense for theme-park promotional reasons, but not calling it Holly Dolly Christmas is a huge missed opportunity. Is it just going to be a thinly veiled travelogue for Dollywood\u2019s Smoky Mountain Christmas Festival? Oh, definitely. But Dolly Parton\u2019s in it, so we\u2019re all watching it.\n\nChristmas Stars (Lifetime, December 13 at 8 p.m.): Aspiring R&B singer Layla (Erica Durance) pairs up with amateur songwriter Spence (J.T. Hodges) to try and land a record deal, but the label thinks Spence might be the real star. Also, it\u2019s set at Christmas!\n\nCountry Singers and Old Hometown Flames\n\nOur Christmas Love Song (Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, November 22 at 9 p.m.): Country star Melody Jones (Alicia Witt) gets accused of plagiarizing her latest holiday single, which is funny because, like, aren\u2019t all holiday songs roughly riffing on the same four musical motifs? What element of the song did she steal, exactly? Bells? Anyway, she returns home to wait out the media storm with her estranged family \u2026 And her old flame (Brendan Hines).\n\nA Charming Inn\n\nA Blue Ridge Mountain Christmas (Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, November 7 at 9 p.m.): Hallmark Channel mainstay Rachael Leigh Cook plays Willow Petersen, who helps her sister plan a wedding at the inn her family once owned. This movie that had a working title of \u201cChristmas Bride.\u201d That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the entry.\n\nCheck Inn to Christmas (Hallmark, November 28 at 8 p.m.): There isn\u2019t a photo of the two leads together on the website, let alone a blurb. I love the unnecessary punnage behind this name, though, because it\u2019s only, like, a semi-spin. \u201cCheck In\u201d is already an inn-related term in itself; it\u2019s something one does in an inn. The second n is so, so redundant. It vaguely seems like it\u2019s referencing Elton John\u2019s \u201cStep Into Christmas,\u201d but that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. If there isn\u2019t a travel-writer B-plot, I\u2019m checking out of this one.\n\nA Charming Inn and an Old Flame\n\nChristmas Hotel (Lifetime, December 21 at 8 p.m.): Look. Eventually, you run out of plucky leads to name \u201cHolly.\u201d So you make a movie about the \u201cMt. Holly Inn\u201d in the town of \u201cMt. Holly.\u201d Erin (Tatyana Ali) is sent by her big-city boss to buy out the beloved inn in her hometown, and the townspeople are none too pleased. Her ex-boyfriend Conner fights her on taking over the hotel, but comes to her aid when the hotel staff come down with the flu and the two of them have to plan the Christmas Hotel\u2019s Christmas events. \u201cErin has to figure out if what she really wants is a promotion or to be home again.\u201d It\u2019s insane that we\u2019re still doing this.\n\nA Charming Inn and a Hometown Holiday Concert\n\nNo Time Like Christmas (Lifetime, October 27 at 8 p.m.): Emma (Kyla Pratt) finds herself staying for the holidays at the same charming B&B as her former flame (Ed Ruttle) and his daughter. Together, they have to put on a holiday show (about a magical watch, hence the title?) to save the local historical theater. Kyla Pratt was the voice of Penny Proud, of the Proud Family Prouds. This alone is reason enough to watch. On top of that, Jim O\u2019Heir, Jerry from Parks and Rec, plays a kindly, mysterious man in a bowler hat.\n\nA Hot Single Dad and a Hometown Holiday Concert\n\nChristmas at Graceland: Home for the Holidays (Hallmark, November 23 at 8 p.m.): Hello, Adrian Grenier as a wealthy widower named Owen who falls in love with the nanny to his three children, Harper (Kaitlin Doubleday), while they plan an \u201cElvis at Christmas\u201d Graceland event! With appearances by Priscilla Presley herself and country singer Chase Bryant, this is an E-ticket Hallmark Christmas movie.\n\nA Charming Inn, a Hometown Holiday Concert, and an Old Flame\n\nChristmas Duet (Hallmark, November 25 at 8 p.m.): Nashville\u2019s Chaley Rose and How to Get Away With Murder\u2019s Rome Flynn are Averie and Jesse, a former music duo who reunite at Averie\u2019s Vermont lodge for the annual Yuletide Festival. Will they sing their \u201cfamous\u201d duet, \u201cWouldn\u2019t Be Christmas?\u201d Will they write something new? All we know is \u2026 this one also has a travel-writer B-plot.\n\nA Charming Inn, an Old Flame, and a Hot Single Dad\n\nChristmas Reservations (Lifetime, November 2 at 8 p.m.): Holly is the event coordinator at the Treeline Ski Resort. She\u2019s also Melissa Joan Hart. When her now-widowed college sweetheart (Ricardo Chavira \u2014 Carlos from Desperate Housewives) checks in with his two kids, \u201cHolly discovers she has her own reservations about life and love.\u201d Get it? Christmas Reservations is produced by Hartbreak Films, which of course is Melissa Joan Hart\u2019s impeccably named production company.\n\nA Charming Inn, a Hot Single Dad, and Capitalism\n\nTwinkle All the Way (Lifetime, November 23 at 8 p.m.): Cadence Clark (Sarah Drew) is a wedding planner, planning a wedding at the exclusive Snowview Lodge. Henry Harrison (Ryan McPartlin) is \u201cco-owner of a family-run Christmas decoration and house-lighting company,\u201d who just used up Vulture\u2019s hyphen budget. This movie has it all: adorable daughters and massive snowstorms.\n\nCapitalism and an Old Flame\n\nMatchmaker Christmas (Lifetime, December 14 at 6 p.m.): Not to be confused with 2012 Lacey Chabert Hallmark movie Matchmaker Santa, Lifetime\u2019s Matchmaker Christmas follows editor Maggie, who volunteers to find a date to the office holiday party for her boss. She gets distracted on her quest when a new author joins their publishing company \u2026 and it\u2019s her ex-fianc\u00e9, Jaxson.\n\nMixed Nuts\n\nMerry Liddle Christmas (Lifetime, November 30 at 8 p.m.): For the first time ever, Kelly Rowland enters the world of television production to bring a true story of \u201cher own recent Christmas catastrophe\u201d to life onscreen. Rowland stars as Jacquie, \u201ca successful, super-together single tech entrepreneur\u201d whose family brings all kinds of mess to her house on Christmas. How will she keep it together in time for \u201ca glossy video shoot of \u2018the perfect Christmas\u2019\u201d? It is very brave of Kelly to share this true story of a Christmas catastrophe with audiences \u2014 the stakes have never been higher.\n\nChristmas Town (Hallmark, December 1 at 8 p.m.): Picture this: coral pink nails drumming menacingly on the screen of an iPad Mini second generation, open to Deadline. A full glass of hot milk sits bedside. \u201cWell. Well. Well. Look who they flew to Rome. Rome. Little Miss Lacey thinks she\u2019s queen of the channel now, doesn\u2019t she, Kirk? I\u2019ll show her who really wears the Hallmark crown in this town.\u201d The coral talons clutch the second-gen iPad Mini by its bedazzled case. \u201cTown. That\u2019s it! I\u2019ll have Hallmark build me a whole damn town. A Christmas town!\u201d This is how I imagine Candace Cameron Bure reacting to the news of the Lacey Chabert vehicle Christmas in Rome and responding in turn with the Candace Cameron Bure vehicle Christmas Town, about a teacher who leaves Boston to move to a Christmas town and fall in love with Mutt from Schitt\u2019s Creek.\n\nChristmas in Montana (Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, December 12 at 9 p.m.): Christmas \u2026 but make it in Montana.\n\nBlack Christmas (in theaters December 13): It\u2019s written and directed by women. It\u2019s a Blumhouse adaptation of a 1970s Canadian slasher flick. Cary Elwes plays a professor with a tweedy accent. There\u2019s a reenactment of the Mean Girls \u201cJingle Bell Rock\u201d dance. The tagline is \u201cSlay, girls.\u201d This seems like a fun, spooky reprieve from two months of cable holiday-movie marathoning.\n\nAngel Falls: A Novel Holiday (Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, December 13 at 9 p.m.): Daytime soap star Jen Lilley stars in this, either as a novelist or a fallen angel?\n\nChristmas in Evergreen: Tidings of Joy (Hallmark, December 14 at 8 p.m.): Ah yes, the third in the Hallmark Christmas in Evergreen series, after Christmas in Evergreen and Christmas in Evergreen: Letters to Santa. This third installment will feel like goin\u2019 home to see old friends. I presume. For people out there who really like Christmas in Evergreen. Apparently, the Evergreen franchise is inspired by the literal art on Hallmark greeting cards? Did Hallmark Christmas cards really need a film adaptation?\n\nHoliday Date (Hallmark, December 15 at 8 p.m.): Here\u2019s another one that we don\u2019t know much about, yet. It also has really bad SEO. You know what you get when you google \u201cHoliday Date?\u201d You get Veterans Day. It\u2019s November 11. Now you know.\n\nA Family Christmas Gift (Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, December 2o at 9 p.m.): Hark! Rejoice! Definite Masked Singer contestant Patti LaBelle does Hallmark movies now. We don\u2019t know what this one is about, but we can make informed guesses. Prediction One: There will be pie. Prediction Two: If there\u2019s a Christmas tree in the vicinity, there better be some background singers underneath it.\n\nIt\u2019s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas (Hallmark, December 21 at 8 p.m.): As of October 5, they were still in casting. That piping-hot bit of nog is based on a fan interaction on Twitter with its star, Eric Mabius. On October 5, he also saw an otter.\n\nA Cheerful Christmas (Hallmark, December 22 at 8 p.m.): This one doesn\u2019t have a synopsis. It doesn\u2019t even have a cast. It just has this mood-piece color story on the Hallmark website.\n\nWhen Calls the Heart Christmas (Hallmark, December 25 at 8 p.m.): This! This is the reason for the season! This is what we\u2019re all going to abandon our various family gatherings for on Christmas itself! It\u2019s the Christmas movie for When Calls the Heart, the Hallmark show that literally edited Lori Loughlin out of its sixth season after the college-admissions scandal! They didn\u2019t kill her character off, so could she make a surprise, special appearance in the Christmas special? Leave your loved ones and tune in on Christmas to find out!\n\nNew Year, New Me (Hallmark, December 28 at 8 p.m.): Do New Year\u2019s movies count? Nope!", "description": "Hallmark. Lifetime. Freeform. Netflix. Disney+? There are more options for new holiday programming than ever before, this 2019, and they begin as early as October 25. Where can you watch Christmas movies? And when?
