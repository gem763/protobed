In an interview with The Bachelorette\u2018s Angie Kent, Kyle asked her about the men on the show. Specifically, if Channel 10 had thrown in \u201ca few blacks\u201d for her.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear here, this isn\u2019t an on air gaffe, a silly mistake, a slip of the tongue, or whatever you want to call it. This is Kyle Sandilands living up to his gutter reputation, and still being paid to do it. Because being casually racist on a mainstream radio station is apparently fine in Australia.\n\nDuring some chatter about rose ceremonies, Kyle interrupted the conversation to straight up ask: \u201cWere there any black men in there? Did they throw a few blacks in for you?\u201d\n\nJust \u2013 just \u2013 what the fuck.\n\nEven for Kyle Sandilands \u2013 and it\u2019s stupid to type that, I know \u2013 this is surely another level of deeply fucked.\n\n\u201cI asked for all shapes and sizes,\u201d Angie answered. She also referenced an earlier interview she did with Kyle, in which he asked whether or not The Bachelorette producers had cast a \u201cwheelchair person\u201d in her season.\n\n\u201cDid they bring in any shade of races?\u201d Kyle continued. There\u2019s a sentence you could\u2019ve said a handful of other ways. But of course Kyle went with the most cringe.\n\nYes, Angie answered which Kyle deemed \u201cgood\u201d.\n\nThis entire part of the interview, of Kyle being gross, has been posted on the Kyle & Jackie O Show\u2019s Twitter. It hasn\u2019t been deleted. Probably because this is considered normal/good content for the team.\n\nTwo words: Big sigh.\n\nWe\u2019ll let you know if Kyle mumbles a non-apology on air. I doubt it though. Or maybe he\u2019ll lop it in with whatever he\u2019s forced to apologise for next, re: saying the Virgin Mary was not in fact a virgin. And, he called anyone who believes it \u201cdumb as dog shit.\u201d", "description": "Once again,\u00a0Kyle Sandilands\u00a0has effortlessly spurted more repulsive bullshit live on air.
