REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nProtests broke out on Sept. 20 in Cairo and other cities following online calls for demonstrations against alleged corruption by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the military.\n\nSisi, who has been in New York for the past week attending the United Nations General Assembly, returned to Cairo on Friday morning, where he was greeted by religious dignitaries and a crowd of supporters.\n\nAsking them why they were up so early on a Friday, the first day of Egypt\u2019s weekend, he said: \u201cThe situation isn\u2019t worth it. You need to know that the Egyptian people are very aware... Don\u2019t worry about anything.\u201d\n\nSisi also appeared to repeat his earlier rejection of allegations of corruption posted online by Mohamed Ali, a former contractor and actor, in the run-up to the protests. Ali\u2019s videos have attracted a wide following.\n\n\u201cThis is an image being painted as was done before, comprised of lies and defamation and some media working to present an image that isn\u2019t true. We\u2019re really strong, the country is really strong with (because of) you,\u201d he said in a video posted on his official Facebook page.\n\nSince last weekend\u2019s protests, authorities have carried out a campaign of mass arrests which rights monitors say has seen at least 1,900 people detained. Egypt\u2019s public prosecutor said on Thursday that \u201cnot more than 1,000\u201d had been questioned after participating in protests.\n\nAli has called for new protests this Friday, though government supporters are also planning rallies to show their backing for Sisi.\n\nHEAVY POLICE PRESENCE\n\nThe protests have unnerved investors and led to a pro-Sisi campaign in Egypt\u2019s strictly controlled media.\n\nSecurity forces have stepped up their presence in main squares in major cities and have been checking mobile phones for political content.\n\nOn Friday morning, roads leading to Tahrir Square in central Cairo, the epicenter of protests that led to the overthrow of former President Hosni Mubarak in 2011, were closed to traffic, There was a heavy police presence around the square and at some junctions in the city center.\n\nSisi came to power after leading the overthrow of Islamist former President Mohamed Mursi in 2013 following mass protests against Mursi\u2019s rule.\n\nSisi said on Friday that at some point he would request a show of mass support in which Egyptians would \u201cgo out in their millions\u201d.\n\nSisi has overseen a broad crackdown on dissent that has extended to liberal as well as Islamist groups, and which rights groups say is the most severe in recent memory.\n\nSisi\u2019s backers say the crackdown was needed to stabilize Egypt after the turmoil that followed the country\u2019s 2011 uprising.\n\nSeveral hundred of those detained in the past week have been placed under investigation for charges including using social media to spread false news, undermining national security, joining a banned terrorist group, and protesting without a permit, defense lawyers say.", "description": "Egypt's president told supporters not to worry about calls for further protests against his rule on Friday, as security forces tightened controls in the center of the capital and closed off entrances to Tahrir Square.", "authors": ["Aidan Lewis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434461254&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0IQ", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
