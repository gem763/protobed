Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.). He added, \u201cI know Elijah would be the first one to tell us to get back to work and to keep fighting.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMaryland\u2019s deep-blue 7th Congressional District, which Cummings had represented since 1996, includes parts of Baltimore City and Baltimore and Howard counties. According to state law, the earliest that a primary election could legally be held is 65 days after Hogan\u2019s proclamation. A general election must be held at least 65 days after the primary.\n\nAD\n\nWhoever fills the seat would have to decide whether to run for a full two-year term in 2020, which would mean competing in the April 28 primary and the November general election.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a person that will fill the seat, and then another primary election,\u201d said Jared DeMarinis, director of the state election board\u2019s division of candidacy and campaign finance. \u201cSo people will be running for both.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHogan spokesman Mike Ricci said there were no details yet on when the Republican governor would announce the special election.\n\nAmong the Democrats floated to succeed Cummings were his wife, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, who chairs the state Democratic Party and briefly ran for governor in 2018; state Dels. Nick J. Mosby and Talmadge Branch, and state Sens. Jill P. Carter, Antonio L. Hayes and Cory V. McCray, all of whom represent Baltimore City; Mosby\u2019s wife, Baltimore State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn J. Mosby; former Baltimore mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake; and Ben Jealous, a former NAACP president who was the state\u2019s 2018 Democratic gubernatorial nominee.\n\nAD\n\nRockeymoore Cummings\u2019s name recognition, and the reverence people have for her late husband, would give her an automatic jump on the competition, a Hill aide said. In addition, there\u2019s a thirst for a woman to join Maryland\u2019s congressional delegation, which has been all-male since the departures of Barbara A. Mikulski and Donna F. Edwards in January 2017.\n\nAD\n\nHowever, Cummings faced little to no challengers for decades, leaving his widow without a robust fundraising network that could be reactivated to support her own bid.\n\nMaryland Democratic Party spokesman Arinze Ifekauche declined to comment on possible successors, as did several of those mentioned as contenders. They said the day should be about mourning Cummings.\n\n\u201cFor me and Marilyn both, that is the furthest thing from our minds right now,\u201d Nick Mosby said about the special election. \u201cI am completely devastated.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMarilyn J. Mosby said Cummings helped launch her political career and was the first person she called after deciding to charge the six police officers involved in the 2015 death of Freddie Gray.\n\nAD\n\nCummings spoke at Gray\u2019s funeral and helped calm the unrest that followed it.\n\nThe congressman was \u201ca voice for the voiceless,\u201d Marilyn J. Mosby said, \u201cand a mentor to a whole generation of leaders.\u201d\n\nRockeymoore Cummings said in a statement that her husband \u201cworked until his last breath because he believed our democracy was the highest and best expression of our collective humanity.\u201d\n\nBranch recalled spending 40 minutes on the phone with Cummings after Branch\u2019s grandson was killed in a shooting in 2017. \u201cI thought it was going to be a two-minute call,\u201d he said.\n\nCarter, a former state delegate, said Cummings pushed her to run for state senate. She described him as \u201ca special kind of elected official in that you could feel his heart and his passion.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think that at this time we need to focus on our grief and offering condolences and support to Maya and their family,\u201d she said.\n\nState Sen. Mary L. Washington (D-Baltimore City), however, said she would like to see Rockeymoore Cummings fill the seat. \u201cI\u2019m interested in making sure there\u2019s a strong voice from Baltimore,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be great to have a woman join our delegation, and especially a woman of color.\u201d\n\nHogan ordered flags flown at half-staff Thursday in honor of Cummings, whom he described as \u201ca fierce advocate for civil rights and for Maryland for more than three decades.\u201d\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations and Maryland\u2019s branch of the NAACP asked the governor to declare Oct. 17 an annual \u201cStatewide Day of Public Service\u201d in memory of Cummings.\n\nAD\n\nIn Congress, members of Maryland\u2019s delegation huddled around Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) on the floor as he spoke about Cummings\u2019s life and the example he set in Congress. \u201cWe\u2019re better than that,\u201d Hoyer said, referencing Cummings\u2019s frequent refrain.\n\nAD\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), a Baltimore native, said Cummings always calmed the waters, no matter how rough-and-tumble the discourse was. He had participated in the caucus conference call remotely on Friday, while still recovering from a recent medical procedure. Pelosi said she had thought Cummings would return to the Hill in a few weeks.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s now with the angels, out of pain,\u201d she added, through tears.\n\nAD\n\nMinority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) spoke of the Democrat\u2019s power and influence \u2014 but also the kindness he showed members of both parties. \u201cIf you\u2019re a freshman, I hope you took a few minutes with him,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI feel I\u2019m better for having known him.\u201d\n\nThe front-row seat in the House chamber that Cummings usually occupied was covered in white hydrangeas and white roses on Thursday. At the end of the floor session, lawmakers rose for a moment of silence, then adjourned in their colleague\u2019s memory.\n\nAD", "description": "The longtime lawmaker\u2019s seat will be filled through a special election in early 2020.", "authors": ["Rachel Chason", "Reporter Covering Local Politics", "Jenna Portnoy", "Reporter Covering Virginia", "Maryland", "D.C.
