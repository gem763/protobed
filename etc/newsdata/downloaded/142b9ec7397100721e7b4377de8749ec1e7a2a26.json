He narrowly won re-election last November, three months after he was criminally charged.\n\nThe criminal case arises from Collins\u2019 role as a board member and 16.8% stakeholder of Australian biotechnology company Innate Immunotherapeutics Ltd.\n\nCollins said in court Tuesday that in June 2017, during a congressional picnic on the White House lawn, he learned in an email from Innate\u2019s chief executive that the company\u2019s experimental multiple sclerosis drug, MIS416, had failed in a clinical trial.\n\nCollins admitted that he immediately called his son, Cameron Collins, to tell him the news, allowing him to sell his Innate shares and avoid losses when it became public. Chris Collins said he was in \u201ca very emotional state\u201d when he made the call because he was upset the drug had failed.\n\n\u201cWhen I did these things, I knew they were illegal and improper,\u201d he said. \u201cThe actions I took are anything but those a model citizen would take.\u201d\n\nThe congressman did not trade his own Innate stock, which lost millions of dollars in value. Prosecutors have said he was \u201cvirtually precluded\u201d from trading in part because he already faced a congressional ethics probe over Innate.\n\nHowever, they said, Cameron Collins went on to tip his fianc\u00e9e, Lauren Zarsky; her parents, Dorothy and Stephen Zarsky; and a friend. Stephen Zarsky went on to tip off additional unnamed people, the prosecutors said.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nIn all, prosecutors said, the people who received the tips were able to avoid a total of more than $768,000 in losses when Innate\u2019s share price plunged 92% after news of the drug\u2019s failure became public.\n\nCameron Collins, 26, and Stephen Zarsky, 67, have been charged in the case and are scheduled to plead guilty on Thursday, court records show.\n\nLauren and Dorothy Zarsky were not criminally charged, but agreed to surrender the money they made selling Innate stock to the Securities and Exchange Commission under a civil settlement without admitting wrongdoing.", "description": "Chris Collins, a former U.S. Congressman from New York state who was known as an early backer of President Donald Trump, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to taking part in an insider trading scheme.", "authors": ["Brendan Pierson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1436001155&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF903DU", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
