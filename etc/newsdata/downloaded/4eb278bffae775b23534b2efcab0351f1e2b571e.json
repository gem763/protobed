A moderator posted an explanatory message from Reddit, which has asked moderators to make it clear that \u201cviolent content is unacceptable\u201d on the forum. The move comes two days after Media Matters for America noted that r/The_Donald members were supporting violent attacks on Oregon police and other public officials.\n\n\u201cWe are clear in our site-wide policies that posting content that encourages or threatens violence is not allowed on Reddit. As we have shared, we are sensitive to what could be considered political speech, however, recent behaviors including threats against the police and public figures is content that is prohibited by our violence policy. As a result, we have actioned individual users and quarantined the subreddit,\u201d said a Reddit spokesperson in a statement to The Verge.\n\nMedia Matters for America pointed out posts where r/The_Donald members fantasized about or encouraged violence related to Oregon\u2019s recent climate change vote where Republican lawmakers fled the state Senate to prevent a climate change bill from passing, one of them even implying that he would respond to any police action with violence. r/The_Donald members posted comments like \u201cnone of this gets fixed without people picking up rifles\u201d and \u201c[I have] no problems shooting a cop trying to strip rights from Citizens.\u201d The posts were later removed.\n\nThe Reddit post describes the quarantine as the result of repeated rule-breaking, calling out r/The_Donald\u2019s recent \u201cencouragement of violence\u201d against Oregonian officials.\n\nOver the last few months we have observed repeated rule-breaking behavior in your community and an over-reliance on Reddit admins to manage users and remove posts that violate our content policy, including content that encourages or incites violence. Most recently, we have observed this behavior in the form of encouragement of violence towards police officers and public officials in Oregon. This is not only in violation of our site-wide policies, but also your own community rules (rule #9). You can find violating content that we removed in your mod logs. As we have discussed in the past, and as detailed in our content policy and moderator guidelines, we expect you to enforce against rule-breaking content. You\u2019ve made progress over the last year, but we continue to observe and take action on a disproportionate amount of rule-breaking behavior in this community. We recognize that you do remove posts that are reported, but we are troubled that violent content more often goes unreported, and worse, is upvoted.\n\nr/The_Donald has been censured for rule-breaking in the past. In 2016, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said the site would hide some posts from the subreddit, preventing them from making it to the front page. But its political relevance and popularity have made it a difficult target. Huffman later called it \u201ca small part of a large problem we face in this country \u2014 that a large part of the population feels unheard, and the last thing we\u2019re going to do is take their voice away.\u201d\n\nReddit long resisted banning or quarantining subreddits, even ones explicitly devoted to white supremacy or other hate content. But it\u2019s changed that policy in recent years. It banned forums related to the QAnon conspiracy theory in 2018, and it\u2019s quarantined or purged other far-right subreddits.\n\nr/The_Donald, for its part, hasn\u2019t been banned. The quarantine is a largely symbolic gesture. In Reddit\u2019s words, \u201cvisitors to this community will see a warning that requires users to explicitly opt-in to viewing it. This messaging reminds users of the importance of reporting rule-breaking content.\u201d It will be reevaluated if the moderators \u201cunambiguously communicate to your subscribers that violent content is unacceptable.\u201d", "description": "Reddit has placed controversial subreddit r/The_Donald behind a quarantine wall after \"repeated\" misbehavior, including calls for violence against police in Oregon.", "authors": ["Adi Robertson", "Jun"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sOy7zM77kTTaprbHREw6kJMJK9k=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10646763/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-26"}
