Over generations, it carried thousands of locals on fishing trips and to scuba-certification dives at the wild Channel Islands, where it now lies perilously on the sea bottom with an unknown number of bodies in its hold.\n\nThe predawn fire that burned and sunk the boat is presumed to have killed 34 people \u2014 all 33 guests who had chartered the Conception for the long holiday weekend and one member of its crew. The news conjured up wistful what-if memories throughout the city, revealed in flurries of text messages to friends, one of which began: \u201cHorrific tragedy, and my girls have slept in those bunks at some point in the last five years.\u201d\n\nSanta Barbara celebrity resident Rob Lowe noted on Twitter that he had been on the Conception many times.\n\n\u201cEveryone in my circle has a story about it,\u201d said Grant Lepper, a marketing executive who did a \u201ccheckup dive\u201d off the Conception a few years ago at Anacapa Island. \u201cIt was a great boat, great crew.\u201d\n\nNow the community is trying to understand what happened.\n\n\n\nThe Conception, a dive boat based in Santa Barbara, burns Monday morning.

All 34 people who were unaccounted for are now presumed dead, and investigators are focusing on the cause of the blaze and the response of the five surviving crew members.\n\nIn all, emergency crews have recovered 20 bodies from the site around the Conception, the 75-foot boat that sank off the northern coast of Santa Cruz Island after catching fire at about 3:15 a.m. Monday. Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said Tuesday that the majority of those on board for the three-day dive trip were from San Jose and Santa Cruz, but authorities have not yet publicly identified the victims.\n\n[20 bodies recovered after California boat fire]\n\nEleven of the bodies, delivered by rescue crews to an overwhelmed county coroner\u2019s office here, are female. The other nine have been identified as male. Divers have located as many as six more in the boat\u2019s wreckage, which is scattered along a half-mile of ocean bottom in waters dipping to 65 feet, but have not yet recovered them.\n\nThe official death toll is now 26, making it one of the worst sea disasters in recent history. It is also the second tragedy involving mass fatalities in as many years here in this Southern California community, a place not accustomed to drama. Nearly two dozen people died in the January 2018 mudslides that followed the largest wildfire in county history.\n\nThe Coast Guard on Tuesday announced that it has called off further operations to find survivors, meaning the final toll will probably be all 34 people believed to have gone down with the Conception. While divers worked Tuesday to make the wreckage safe to extract more bodies, medical examiners were set to begin taking DNA samples from the relatives of victims.\n\n\n\nA woman places a flower Tuesday at a makeshift memorial in Santa Barbara, Calif., for the victims of a blaze aboard a diving boat.

The boats are known among locals who work at sea as a midcareer steppingstone between entry-level crew work and jobs on major commercial fishing vessels. Many here have worked on the Conception before moving up to larger boats.\n\nThe Conception\u2019s only survivors are five crew members, including its well-regarded captain, Jerry Boylan. All of them slept on the topmost of the boat\u2019s three levels, where the crew had its berths near the bridge. A sixth crew member was sleeping with the rest of the passengers in quarters below deck and is presumed dead.\n\nThe five got to a nearby boat, the Grape Escape, using the Conception\u2019s tender. There they made a second mayday call to the Coast Guard. But officials said Tuesday that it appears none of the 33 guests made it out of the lowest level of the boat where the bunks were located.\n\n\n\nMembers of the U.S. Coast Guard board the vessel Vision, sister ship to the Conception, the ship that burned and sank the morning before, as the investigation continued Tuesday in Santa Barbara.

There also has been some confusion arising from the transcripts of the pair of mayday calls, which Brown, the sheriff, said have been \u201cconflated\u201d in reporting.\n\nOne passage suggests the doors to the lower decks were locked. But Coast Guard Capt. Monica Rochester, the commanding officer of the Long Beach-Los Angeles sector, said there are no doors on the boat and that only curtains separate the bunks.\n\nFrom the accounts given to rescue workers by the crew \u2014 who were to be interviewed formally Tuesday as part of the investigation \u2014 the fire broke out rapidly and burned very hot. The single stairwell and escape hatch might have been blocked by flames.\n\n\u201cThat appears to be exactly what happened,\u201d Brown told reporters. \u201cThere is no indication at this point that there was an explosion.\u201d\n\nBrown said the recovery work being carried out off Santa Cruz is \u201ctaxing and dangerous,\u201d an operation that has received support from law enforcement agencies around the state.\n\nAdditional staff from the Los Angeles and Sacramento coroners\u2019 offices also have arrived to help with DNA collection and identification, which officials warned will be time-consuming even with the new techniques.\n\nSo far, family members from 30 of the 34 presumed victims have been in touch with county officials, who said Tuesday they would be carrying out mouth swabs to collect DNA in the days ahead. Brown said the bodies recovered so far showed signs of \u201cextreme thermal damage.\u201d\n\nNick Ise lives in the harbor on Isn\u2019t It, his 30-foot sailboat. He has taken dive trips on the Conception and has known several people who worked aboard. He calls the boat and its crew \u201cas good as it gets.\u201d\n\nThe tragedy, Ise said, is \u201cthe biggest thing that\u2019s happened to the harbor.\u201d He worries now about the company\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cWhat happens next is up to the owner,\u201d said Ise, a website developer. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want them to be replaced.\u201d", "description": "Authorities have recovered 20 bodies \u2014 all badly burned \u2014 while others remain on the ocean floor.", "authors": ["Scott Wilson", "Senior National Correspondent Focusing On California", "The West", "September At Pm", "Scott Wilson Is A Senior National Correspondent For The Washington Post", "Covering California", "The West.
