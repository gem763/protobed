REUTERS/Costas Baltas\n\nHundreds of state workers waving orange flags and chanting \u201cNo to the sell-off of services!\u201d rallied outside parliament as lawmakers debated a 777-page bill submitted by the government, which it says will make Greece more business-friendly.\n\nLawmakers are expected to vote on the bill later on Thursday.\n\nThe government, which has 158 deputies in the 300-seat parliament, says the bill is aimed at curtailing red tape to attract more investment, create jobs and spur growth after a multi-year financial crisis.\n\nOutsourcing waste collection and cleaning services is common practice in other European countries, ministers have said.\n\nBut workers, fearing job cuts, accuse the ruling conservatives of allowing the privatisation of garbage collection, cleaning and gardening. They also believe that the reforms will lead to higher municipal levies.\n\nPublic-sector unions were planning more protests in the evening against labour reforms included in the bill, which they say are hurting labour rights and weakening wage bargaining.\n\nAfter output fell by nearly a quarter during the crisis and unpopular reforms were implemented, Greece\u2019s economy has been growing in recent years.
