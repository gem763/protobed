The Journalist Who Wrote About It Paid a Price.", "language": "en", "text": "Mr. Biancardi wrote about how the court had ruled against him. That drew attention from others who asked for articles about themselves to be taken down.\n\nOne of those demands was from Vittorio Pecoraro, now in his 80s, who was stabbed by his brother , Umberto, in the 2008 seaside restaurant brawl. The brothers were arrested after the fight. Assault-related charges against Vittorio Pecoraro were effectively dropped when the authorities did not pursue them.\n\nVittorio Pecoraro sued Mr. Biancardi, citing the right to be forgotten. Mr. Biancardi refused to remove the article. The story had been based on information from the police, he said. Nothing was factually wrong.\n\nBut Vittorio Pecoraro argued that his privacy had been violated. The article was easily available and searchable online, and he had not been convicted of a crime. Yet because of PrimaDaNoi, what he considered a humiliating family argument had become the first thing that many people knew about him and his pizza and seafood restaurant, he said.\n\n\u201cI have a reputation, I have been here for 50 years, I am known all over,\u201d Mr. Pecoraro said in an interview at the restaurant, Positano, where the 2008 fight had occurred.\n\nHis lawyer, Paolo Sardini, said Google was not targeted because the article was Mr. Biancardi\u2019s responsibility.\n\nUmberto Pecoraro\u2019s son, Vincenzo, said his father declined to comment.\n\nIn 2013, an Italian judge ruled in favor of Vittorio Pecoraro and ordered PrimaDaNoi to delete its stabbing story, saying the information in it was old and no longer in the public interest. (Mr. Pecoraro didn\u2019t ask for another PrimaDaNoi article about the incident to be deleted because it didn\u2019t rank high in Google\u2019s search results for his restaurant.)", "description": "The use of Europe\u2019s \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d privacy law has broadened, illustrated by two Italian brothers, a stabbing and the journalist who wrote about them.", "authors": ["Adam Satariano", "Emma Bubola"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/23/world/23forgotten-print1/00forgotten-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
