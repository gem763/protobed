In a meeting with Malpass at the Bank\u2019s annual meeting in Washington, Sharma said action was needed to:\n\nIncrease the Bank\u2019s financial support to tackle the climate crisis, including helping the most vulnerable communities to become more resilient and preparing for potential natural disasters\n\nPreserve biodiversity and invest in innovative nature-based solutions such as reforestation\n\nFocus on mobilising private-sector investment for the poorest countries \u2013 and making a priority of green, quality infrastructure projects that form the backbone of economic growth\n\nBring about improved debt transparency and sustainability, through balancing the need for finance with limits on how much governments are borrowing from different sources before the International Development Association agrees more loans\n\nProvide extra money and an increase in World Bank staff based in fragile and conflict-stricken countries\n\nImprove rights of women and girls through increasing access to safe family planning services, ensuring girls can go to school and stronger laws against gender-based violence.\n\nAlmost all 10-year-olds in world's poorest countries struggle to read Read more\n\nSharma said: \u201cThe UK is leading the way to build sustainable economies. It is my ambition that within 10 years our partner countries will raise 10 times more resource through private-sector investment and their own tax revenues than they receive in UK aid.\n\n\u201cTo help meet this challenge, the World Bank must prioritise fighting climate change, investing in quality infrastructure, improving the rights of women and girls and giving a lifeline to people living in conflict zones.\u201d\n\nA World Bank spokesman said: \u201cWe are always grateful for the United Kingdom\u2019s support of IDA. The proposed policy package in IDA 19 will direct more funding toward people in fragile and conflict-affected situations, and will reaffirm our commitment to projects that benefit the climate and promote greater inclusion, for example on gender and persons with disabilities.\u201d", "description": "Size of British contribution also hinges on better gender equality and an anti-poverty approach", "authors": ["Larry Elliott", "Larry Elliott In Washington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2905d1c09d1a27de1c183dfa5cdcc10c869932d9/0_124_5472_3284/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6796e55eafc7ef00c9700dfcda871857", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
