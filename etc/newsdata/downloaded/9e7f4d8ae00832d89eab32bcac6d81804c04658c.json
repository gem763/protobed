While Trump has touted his administration\u2019s attention to the Hurricane Dorian, his assistance has come tinged with an air of annoyance. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo White House Hurricane Trump meets Hurricane Dorian in Puerto Rico The president has been reviving old feuds as his administration attempts to prevent a repeat of its much-criticized response to the storms that ravaged Puerto Rico two years ago.\n\nHurricane Dorian hasn\u2019t yet made landfall in Puerto Rico, but President Donald Trump is already picking at old wounds, reviving attacks on the island territory and its leaders as the storm bears down.\n\nThe president has been battering Puerto Rico all week, raining down falsehoods from his Twitter feed and reviving old feuds while authorizing his administration to mobilize as officials attempt to prevent a repeat of its much-criticized response to back-to-back storms that ravaged the island territory two years ago.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe National Hurricane Center on Wednesday upgraded Dorian from a tropical storm to a hurricane as it crossed through the U.S. Virgin Islands with wind gusts of up to 90 mph. The storm is expected to intensify, potentially growing into a Category 3 storm by the time it approaches the Florida coast this weekend.\n\n\u201cWill it ever end?\u201d Trump mused on Twitter earlier this week, when forecasts showing Puerto Rico in Dorian\u2019s path began to solidify. Wednesday, hours before the storm made landfall, Trump again appeared frustrated that the Caribbean island territory was in the bull\u2019s-eye of yet another natural disaster.\n\n\u201cWe are tracking closely tropical storm Dorian as it heads, as usual, to Puerto Rico,\u201d he said in a tweet, pledging that \u201cFEMA and all others are ready, and will do a great job.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen they do,\u201d he continued, \u201clet them know it, and give them a big Thank You \u2014 Not like last time. That includes from the incompetent Mayor of San Juan!\u201d\n\nGlobal Translations A new podcast series from POLITICO.

Trump has relentlessly dinged the island\u2019s top officials over allegations of corruption amid a financial crisis that existed well before the 2017 storms.\n\nTrump also continued to dismiss the island\u2019s nearly 3 million residents \u2014 all U.S. citizens \u2014 as being insufficiently grateful for federal aid, and continued to conflate a long-term estimated price tag for the recovery from the 2017 hurricanes with the amount of money Congress has actually appropriated.\n\nThough the capital of San Juan is not expected to bear the brunt of the storm, Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz has said in the lead up that her municipality is prepared, and that she is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d in the federal government\u2019s ability to do its job there.\n\nStill, she said in an interview Wednesday on MSNBC, \u201cwe honestly have no time for the tweeting, incompetence of the president of the United States who \u2026 continues to get underway with his divisive and aggressive comments toward the people of Puerto Rico.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments only \u201cstand in the way\u201d of relief efforts, she said, suggesting the president butt out \u201cif you can't say anything nice.\u201d\n\nEven a Republican, Puerto Rico\u2019s nonvoting House member Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez, scolded Trump over his comments, tweeting that \u201churricanes are no one\u2019s fault. This is the time for all of us to stand shoulder to shoulder to help our fellow Americans suffering from a natural disaster.\u201d\n\nIn the same tweet, Gonz\u00e1lez also thanked Trump for \"promptly deploying personnel & declaring an emergency.\"\n\nAnd while Cruz explicitly told the president to remain hands off in the coming days, she acknowledged that he did not deserve all of the blame for the fumbled response to the 2017 storms that left nearly 3,000 dead and parts of the island without power for almost a year. The island has still not fully recovered from the disasters, Cruz said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump shakes hands and hands out supplies after Hurricane Maria in 2017 in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. | Evan Vucci/AP Photo\n\nNoting that Puerto Rico has seen less than half of the nearly $40 billion in aid approved by Congress, Cruz allowed that at least some blame lies with former Gov. Ricardo Rossello, who resigned earlier this month following a federal investigation into corruption in his administration and the leak of his comments in a profanity-laden group chat.\n\nTrump\u2019s feud with Puerto Rico has cropped up sporadically over the past two years.\n\nTrump has invoked his administration's efforts in Puerto Rico during subsequent hurricanes, dubbing himself the \"best thing that\u2019s ever happened to Puerto Rico,\u201d while at times referring to Congress as \"foolish\" for continuing to approve more disaster aid money for the troubled island.\n\nHe has declined to recognize the death toll from the two hurricanes, which was revised upward to almost 3,000 after an independent study debunked the official death toll of 64. Trump has cast doubt on the revision, labeling it a politically motivated smear campaign.\n\nTrump has used his repetitive overstatement of the amount of disaster relief Puerto Rico\u2019s received from his administration to justify attempts to decrease the amount of aid for the island, even as he has pushed for more hurricane relief money for states like Texas and Florida. His opposition to Puerto Rico aid held up a massive relief package earlier this year before the president relented after months of deadlock.\n\nAnd just this week, Democrats cried foul following the news that Trump administration plans to divert $271 million from various Department of Homeland Security accounts \u2014 including $155 million in federal disaster aid \u2014 to beef up funding for immigration enforcement. Puerto Rico advocates also howled when it was reported in January that Trump had been briefed on a plan to dip into Puerto Rico disaster recovery funds to fund his desired wall along the southern border.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201907/938/1155968404_6063249718001_6063246423001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said Wednesday that the administration\u2019s move to shift money around would not affect hurricane recovery or preparedness efforts. And he pledged that the White House would continue to stand by and monitor the situation in Puerto Rico.\n\n\u201cThe president has done everything in his power to make sure that the people of Puerto Rico are prepared for this next storm and they are still rebuilding from the last one it\u2019s because of the billion dollars we sent down there,\u201d Gidley said in an interview on Fox News, accusing local politicians of \u201cpropping up their own bank accounts as opposed to helping the people of Puerto Rico.\u201d\n\nCruz on Wednesday vowed that she would not let her past conflicts with Trump draw her attention away from her constituents, arguing that \u201cas he turns his back on us, the American people open their hearts to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is about an island nation in the middle of the Caribbean that he can\u2019t blame for being in the hurricane\u2019s path,\u201d she said on MSNBC, citing Trump\u2019s earlier tweets. \u201cAgain, if he can't be supportive, let those that are willing to be supportive take on the task of saving lives.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to show that the amount of Puerto Rico aid approved by Congress is nearly $40 billion.", "description": "The president has been reviving old feuds as his administration attempts to prevent a repeat of its much-criticized response to the storms that ravaged Puerto Rico two years ago.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/bf/7a/d1a9ae4942f8a066c2367120da03/20190828-trump-boards-plane-ap-773.jpg"}
