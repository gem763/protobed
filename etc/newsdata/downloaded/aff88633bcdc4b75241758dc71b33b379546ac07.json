Everything was triggered by the press conference\" at which Lam announced the mask ban, Nathalie adds.\n\n\"The government doesn't listen to us. So we are upping our game.\"\n\nBy 11:30 pm, six vans arrived near an intersection beside the MTR station where hundreds of protesters had erected small makeshift barricades.\n\nAbout 20 riot police finally appeared. The protesters pulled back and JC changed from his black jacket -- the colour of clothing favoured by protesters -- into something in a less conspicuous shade.\n\nThen he melted away.\n\nA shirtless man, cigarette in his mouth and beer in hand, walked to the middle of the junction to challenge the officers, much to the approval of the demonstrators.\n\nThen he backed down.\n\nBy 11:45 pm, more than three hours after it all began, the police got back in their vans and headed off.\n\nProtesters let out cries of joy, then very quickly dispersed, leaving the residents of Tseung Kwan O to pick up the pieces.", "description": "In one peaceful community previously untouched by the months of unrest that have shaken Hong Kong, it was an unexpected sight: the methodical ransacking of the local subway station over a three-hour period.
