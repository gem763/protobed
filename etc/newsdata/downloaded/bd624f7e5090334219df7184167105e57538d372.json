Lincoln Financial, USA TODAY\n\nA happy, healthy retirement is most everyone\u2019s dream. We imagine lazy mornings over a cup of coffee and a good book, days relaxing on a tropical beach, exploring foreign lands and playing with our grandkids. No stress. No worry.\n\nWe would be better served to think of retirement as twenty years of unemployment. That's because when it comes to retirement savings, the majority of Americans generally come up short.\n\nAccording to Northwestern Mutual\u2019s Planning & Progress Study 2019, only 16% of the adults surveyed had saved $200,000 or more for retirement. One in five Americans have less than $5,000 saved for their post-work years and 15% have no nest egg at all! So much for no stress, no worry.\n\nAdd to those sobering statistics of under-saving is the fact that most Americans have unrealistic expectations about their standard of living in retirement.\n\nGallup has found that 57% of working Americans expect to retire \u201ccomfortably\u201d and only one-third of those surveyed expect to rely on Social Security as their major source of income. But retiring comfortably with a modest dependence on Social Security will require significantly higher retirement balances than the average working American has set aside.\n\nCEO leaves: Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank steps down as turnaround effort continues\n\nIt's the consumer, stupid: What the consumer sentiment index tells us about the 2020 elections\n\nAs members of the baby boom generation age into retirement -- approximately 10,000 Americans turn 65 every day -- more and more are relying on pension benefits for their main source of income. Millions of aging teachers, firefighters, sanitation workers, and other state and local government employees depend on the income owed to them through defined benefit pension plans. Such plans require employees to contribute a portion of their salaries to a pool of funds that is invested on their behalf and is paid out to them in retirement. Poor management of the pension funds at the state and local levels, however, has put those benefits at risk for many future retirees. According to nongovernmental organization The Pew Charitable Trusts , state pension systems currently have, on average, less than 70% of the assets they need to be able to pay out benefits owed to current or retired public employees. In some states, the gap is significantly smaller, while in others the pension funding gap is far worse. To rank the severity of each state\u2019s pension crisis, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the average pension funding ratio -- the market value of a pension fund as a percentage of the total benefits owed to current or retired public employees -- for all 50 states as of 2017 with data from The Pew Charitable Trusts .

It\u2019s not investing that contains the most risk to our future security.\n\nThough the following study was conducted in 1998, the principles remain relevant. TIAA-CREF\u2019s study, \u201cInvesting for a Distant Goal: Optimal Asset Allocation and Attitudes toward Risk\u201d, asked three prominent investors to recommend asset allocation models over a 40-year period based on years to retirement. For people who had ten years until retirement, the strategists (Burton Malkiel, Jack Bogle and Jane Bryant Quinn) recommended 50%, 70% and 80% allocation to stocks respectively.\n\nQuinn advocated the most aggressive allocation to equities over the 40 years. It is no surprise (employing historical average returns for stocks and bonds) that the study found Quinn\u2019s portfolio performed significantly better than the other two strategists\u2019 portfolios. One must take risks to generate returns.\n\nDon\u2019t over diversify\n\nWarren Buffett famously said \u201cdiversification is protection against ignorance. It makes little sense if you know what you are doing.\u201d\n\nIn 2003 I gave an interview recommending five high-quality stocks across five sectors. I discovered that interview ten years later and decided to measure the performance of that small portfolio of securities.\n\nThe names of the companies are not important, but what is significant is the performance of the five stock: Three underperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index from 2003 to 2013 and two dramatically outperformed it. Collectively the five stocks generated a 130% premium to the market over the ten years (which, it should be noted, included the bear market of 2008-2009).\n\nWhether buying stocks, ETFs or mutual funds, pick the very best and stick with them.\n\nThe reality of retirement\n\nThe average lifespan in the U.S. is 78.7 years. If you stop working in your 60s, retirement is indeed 20-plus years of unemployment. To enjoy your golden years comfortably requires retirement savings significantly higher than the majority of Americans have amassed.\n\nSave aggressively, take enough risk and face the facts.\n\nNancy Tengler is chief investment strategist at Tengler Wealth Management, ButcherJoseph Asset Management.
