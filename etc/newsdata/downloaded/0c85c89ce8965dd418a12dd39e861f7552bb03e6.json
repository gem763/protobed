Pursuant to that policy, the White House, state department, and associates including Rudy Giuliani have refused to comply with document requests, and for the first time on Monday a former White House official defied a subpoena to appear in person.\n\nIn a letter to colleagues Monday, Pelosi said that a House vote would \u201celiminate any doubt as to whether the Trump administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstruction of the House of Representatives\u201d.\n\nAdam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) I understand why Trump doesn\u2019t want more witnesses testifying.\n\n\n\nBut I can\u2019t understand why my GOP colleagues are enabling his obstruction.\n\n\n\nWhere is their duty to this institution?\n\n\n\nWhere is their duty to the Constitution?\n\n\n\nWhere is their respect for the rule of law? pic.twitter.com/mXuLQxJ6mK\n\nWhy it matters\n\nThe move underscores the intention of Democrats to move fast on impeachment. A committee will meet on Wednesday to draft a resolution to formalize the impeachment process, Pelosi said. The process will include a plan to hold public hearings, to authorize the disclosure of deposition transcripts, to outline procedures to transfer evidence to the judiciary committee and other provisions.\n\nGuardian read of the day\n\nPelosi plans to call House vote on resolution to formalize impeachment inquiry\n\nLine of the day\n\n\u201cNobody is above the law.\u201d \u2013 Nancy Pelosi\n\nWhat\u2019s next\n\nHouse to vote on resolution on next steps in impeachment inquiry \u2013 live Read more\n\nAt least three Trump administration officials are scheduled to speak with investigators this week. Notable among them is Timothy Morrison, a national security council member who has been described in previous testimony as having misgivings about the Trump administration\u2019s shadow foreign policy in Ukraine.\n\nMorrison will be invited to describe those misgivings on Thursday.\n\nThe big picture\n\nTrump\u2019s impeachment remained a likely prospect, with majority support among Democrats in the House unchanged and the latest polls showing robust public support as well. But for Trump to be removed from office, about 20 Republican senators would have to defect, and there was no new sign on Monday of such a movement.", "description": "Nancy Pelosi announced a vote to lay out steps for moving the inquiry from closed-door depositions to public hearings \u2013 here\u2019s what you need to know", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7f3926f916068e062cd20e51fd9cee65dac232d/0_195_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fcb6e2870a9022f4b30f078346e61d01", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
