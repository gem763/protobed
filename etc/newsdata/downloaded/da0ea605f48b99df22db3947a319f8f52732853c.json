He said a little while ago.\u201d\n\nNovella, dressed in a grey suit, with a navy blue scarf almost obscuring the \u201813\u2019 tattoo on his neck, kept his eyes cast down.\n\nHe recently pleaded not guilty to the murder.\n\nAmbush\n\nThe duty manager decided she would go across to their room to make sure everything was okay.\n\nWasmuth and a colleague left at the same time to walk down to the mountain pool. They returned around 10 minutes later, where she saw Novella smoking on the terrace a few metres away.\n\nThey got to the rope bridge and saw there were a lot of people at the room. Novella passed them, walked over the bridge and went to the room.\n\nShe did not see him again.\n\nThe defence said it was taken by surprise that \u201c95%\u201d of the witness\u2019 evidence-in-chief was not contained in her two statements they received.\n\nNovella\u2019s lawyer William Booth accused the State of \u201cambushing\u201d him.\n\nHe would need time to raise the new evidence with his client and get instructions.\n\nProsecutor Louise Friester-Sampson said much of the witness\u2019s evidence on Thursday came out of consultations in preparation for the trial.\n\n\u201cWe are not obliged to re-take and re-take statements to cover all aspects. There is no malice from the State.\u201d\n\nThe trial would resume on Monday.", "description": "On the day that the body of US marketing executive Gabriela Kabrins Alban was found in a suite at a luxurious Camps Bay hotel, her Guatemalan roommate calmly told staff \u201cmy lovely lady is dead\u201d.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/587/8218c4ff06804ae1bfb17ba0883c16b7.jpg", "published_at": "2017-05-25"}
