Elijah Cummings has meant the loss of a key Democratic leader, an eloquent voice for and confidante of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who played a central figure in the House's ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\n\nCummings, who served as chairman of the powerful House Oversight and Reform Committee, will be succeeded by New York Democrat Carolyn Maloney on an acting basis. And there's no indication that the inquiry, now in its fourth week, is slowing down amid the tragedy.\n\nPelosi said the House is continuing to gather evidence and talk to witnesses as it investigates efforts by Trump to pressure the Ukrainian government to provide potentially damaging information on 2020 political rival Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nTrump's acting chief of staff acknowledged Thursday that financial aid to Ukraine at the center of a House impeachment inquiry was withheld because of the president's desire for the country to engage in U.S. politics.\n\nMick Mulvaney's assertion was the first time a White House official has conceded Trump set up a quid quo pro scenario in which money approved by Congress for Ukraine was used as leverage, though he defended the arrangement as standard practice.\n\nThe son of sharecroppers, Cummings was one the earliest and most aggressive committee chairmen investigating Trump, sending requests for information while in the minority during the first two years of the president's term and then calling hearings and demanding documents after Democrats regained control of the House in January.\n\nHe accused the administration of stonewalling his requests for documents on a variety of subjects including whether Trump was profiting unconstitutionally from his namesake business while president and why a citizenship question was proposed for the U.S. Census in 2020.\n\nHere are some key questions about Cummings, Maloney and where the impeachment process goes from here:\n\nQ: What was Cummings' role in helping lead impeachment efforts?\n\nA: As chair of a committee responsible for unearthing evidence of potential corruption, the Maryland Democrat has been at the center of the impeachment effort by leading a panel that demanded key documents and records.\n\nIn recent weeks, Cummings' panel has issued several subpoenas to key witnesses in the investigation: Energy Secretary Rick Perry about his contacts with the Ukrainian government; to the lawyer for two Ukrainian-born business partners who helped Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in trying to find dirt on the Bidens; and the White House itself for pertinent documents.\n\nLatest witness: Impeachment inquiry: Trump ambassador 'disappointed' with Rudy Giuliani's influence in Ukraine policy\n\nEven before the formal impeachment inquiry, Cummings was responsible for convening the committee hearing in February when Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, testified that the president encouraged him to lie to Congress and the public for Trump's protection.\n\nQ: How will the loss of Cummings affect impeachment?\n\nA: The West Baltimore native (who got into a very public spat about his hometown with the president earlier this summer) has been a forceful voice against the Trump administration on a number of issues including the cost of prescription drugs and civil rights.\n\nIn this April 12, 2016 file photo, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., speaks during a National Press Club Newsmaker news conference, on Equal Pay Day, at the National Press Club in Washington. More\n\nLeading the Oversight and Reform Committee, Cummings was one of the three chairmen heading the impeachment (along with Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Foreign Affairs Eliot Engel). Cummings' death.\n\nBut Pelosi made clear that the inquiry was still on track despite a tragedy that silenced one of Congress' most powerful voices.", "description": "New York Democrat Carolyn Maloney takes over as chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee and will play a key role in the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Ledyard King", "Bart Jansen", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bsXF8XHuGKzhwGMVqDsrbQ--~B/aD0yMjI3O3c9MzE0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/2d4261eb93f570aa3ab9f5755d487a0b", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
