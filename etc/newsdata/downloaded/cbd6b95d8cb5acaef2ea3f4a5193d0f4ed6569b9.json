The latest example: While meeting with mental health support organization Waves for Change at Monwabisi beach, Cape Town, both Meghan and Harry praised each other's parenting, calling each other the \"best mum\" and \"best dad.\" You two! You are killing me!\n\nAs Hello! reports, Meghan and Harry took part in a group mindfulness session with Waves for Change, an organization which offers surf therapy to young people. Ash Heese, the organization's training and partnerships manager, told the magazine, \"They were keen to engage with the coaches on their level, no sense of talking down or being patronising towards them. They seemed genuinely interested in our coaches and our coaches are the heart of our programme.\"\n\nThe royal couple were asked to meditate on one of their strengths, according to Heese, and one coach asked Meghan if her skill was dancing. \"She laughed and said no, she doesn\u2019t think so, but parenting is a new strength that her and Harry are learning and developing,\" Heese said.\n\nMeghan then called Harry \"the best dad\" to baby Archie, to which Harry smiled and called her \"the best mum.\" Help me, for this is all too sweet to handle.\n\nMeghan opened up more about parenting to Archie to Nazli Edross-Fakier, whose sister Shaamila Samoodien hosted the royals in her home in Bo-Kaap, Cape Town on Tuesday. The Duchess \"said Archie is the most calm, beautiful, easy baby,\u201d Edross-Fakier, told CNN, adding that Meghan had also revealed, \u201cHe travels well\u2014he slept most of the time on her chest. And then Daddy said 'He\u2019s come alive, he\u2019s shouting and screaming and carrying on.'\"\n\nYou might want to check the @sussexroyal Instagram stories, by the way, because Archie made his first appearance on the tour to meet none other than Archbishop Desmond Tutu. \"Arch meets Archie!\" a post on the couple's Instagram account read. \"This morning The Duke and Duchess were honoured to introduce their son Archie, to Archbishop, Desmond Tutu and his daughter, Thandeka.\"\n\n\n\n\"The Archbishop, a globally respected figure in anti-apartheid movement, is one of the world\u2019s great champions of equality, and has spent his life tirelessly battling injustice,\" the caption read, alongside a photo of Archie reaching to touch Tutu's hand. As first ever royal engagements go? Meeting Nobel Peace Prize winner Tutu is pretty darn impressive.\n\nFor more stories like this, including celebrity news, beauty and fashion advice, savvy political commentary, and fascinating features, sign up for the Marie Claire newsletter.\n\nsubscribe here\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "They called each other the \"best mum\" and \"best dad.\"", "authors": ["Emily Dixon"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nIzvZDONGrnZPxxYzL5wXQ--~B/aD0xMjcyO3c9MjUzNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/marie_claire_447/c5aa31277c3b9e07cab5bc9e34f2da44", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
