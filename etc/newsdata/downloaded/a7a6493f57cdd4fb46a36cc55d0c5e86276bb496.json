Two ways of beating any potential lag between players and Stadia servers are mentioned: rapidly increasing FPS to reduce latency between when a player takes an action and when it\u2019s displayed on the screen, as well as a predictive model that anticipates player inputs and processes them in advance.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we think in a year or two we\u2019ll have games that are running faster and feel more responsive in the cloud than they do locally, regardless of how powerful the local machine is,\u201d Bakar told Edge, adding that Google characterises this as \u201cnegative latency.\u201d\n\nObviously there is no such thing as \u201cnegative latency,\u201d which seems more like marketing jargon than anything. As PC Gamer noted, one game developer on Twitter suspected that the predictive button pressing feature is not some kind of promise that Stadia will come with aim assist or press buttons for players\u2014that would kind of ruin the experience\u2014but instead is just branding talk for branch prediction. That\u2019s a well-known performance trick in programming relying on guesswork, but could run the risk of significant desyncing or rubber banding in fast-paced games. Predictive modelling can be used to generate frames in the cloud in advance and then only display the one to the player that matches with the action they actually take, but with the caveat that it takes a lot more bandwidth. (In a very loose sense, Stadia would indeed be rendering the game microseconds in advance of the player, not that this is actually new to gaming.)\n\nNote that none of these are actually \u201cnegative latency,\u201d which is impossible from the player\u2019s perspective due to causality.\n\nIn any case, while there\u2019s a lot of interest in Stadia, the service has also come under scepticism that it will actually run anywhere near as well as promised. PC Gamer reported significant latency problems in demos in March 2019, with its reporter writing that he died five times in the first level of Doom. (This is not a very difficult level.) Our sister site Kotaku is sceptical that Google can work out the technical issues involved in the short term as well as whether its business model will mean the replacement of game ownership with game \u201caccess.\u201d Then there\u2019s the whole question of things like mods and whether gamers actually want to play single-player titles via the internet; always-on DRM, for example, has long been reviled, and there are tons of people across the country with shitty internet.", "description": "Google sure has some bold plans for its Stadia game streaming service: \u201cnegative latency.\u201d...", "authors": ["Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/t28qvjqdnq1hjtfdoi23.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
