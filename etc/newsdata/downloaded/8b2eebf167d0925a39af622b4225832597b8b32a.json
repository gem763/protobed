I\u2019ve gotten close to George. I was impressed with the piece. It is a full blown treatise written like a litigator would write it, with all the facts fully articulated in the case. So it would be very, very hard to read that and have a counter treatise, if you will, or some kind of defense of the president at this point,\" Scaramucci said on Friday.\n\n\"But, I mean, you agree that the president is officially mentally ill from what George Conway lays out?\" CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota asked.\n\n\"Yeah, I think the president is a sociopath. And I think he has levels of mental illness. But I also think he has levels of mental decline,\" he said.\n\nOnce a member of the Trump administration, for ten days, and a staunch defender of the president, Scaramucci has been outspoken in renouncing his support.\n\nIn Conway's piece about Trump's mental state, he writes, \"You don\u2019t need to be a weatherman to know which way the wind blows, and you don\u2019t need to be a mental-health professional to see that something\u2019s very seriously off with Trump\u2014particularly after nearly three years of watching his erratic and abnormal behavior in the White House.\"\n\nHe adds how, \"No president in recent memory\u2014and likely no president ever\u2014has prompted more discussion about his mental stability and connection with reality.\"", "description": ".10/04/2019 19:46:56PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/277/f8a531b4-ffb7-4044-876d-8aeff955e7dc.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
