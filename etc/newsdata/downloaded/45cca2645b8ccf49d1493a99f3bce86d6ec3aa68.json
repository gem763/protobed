Kavanaugh be investigated or impeached in response to a new allegation that he exposed himself to a female classmate at a drunken dorm party years ago at Yale University.\n\nThe allegation surfaced Saturday night in a New York Times report. A classmate, Max Stier, said he saw Kavanaugh with his pants down at the party, where friends pushed Kavanaugh\u2019s p***s into the young woman\u2019s hand, the Times reported. Stier notified senators and the FBI before Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, but the FBI did not investigate, the Times reported.\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\nThe Washington Post last year confirmed that two intermediaries had relayed such a claim to lawmakers and the FBI. The Post did not publish a story in part because the intermediaries declined to identify the alleged witness and because the woman who was said to be involved declined to comment. The Times article, drawing from reporting for a forthcoming book, is based on interviews with \u201ctwo officials who have communicated with Mr. \u00adStier.\u201d\n\n\n\nStier, the chief executive of a nonpartisan group in Washington, declined to comment Sunday. A court spokeswoman said Kavanaugh had no comment. The woman did not return a call seeking comment.\n\nThe political fallout from the new allegation suggested the divisions surrounding Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination last year will continue to be felt in the 2020 campaign. Republicans denounced the Times report as an effort by the media to smear Kavanaugh. Some seized on the fact that the story \u2014 labeled as a news analysis \u2014 did not mention that, according to the book, the woman involved in the alleged incident has told friends she does not recall it.\n\nOn Sunday morning, President Trump tweeted that Kavanaugh should \u201cstart suing people, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can\u2019t let that happen!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) wrote that the \u201cfar left\u2019s willingness to seize on completely uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations during last year\u2019s confirmation process was a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate.\u201d\n\nImpeachment calls came from Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke (Tex.) and former housing and urban development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, all presidential candidates.\n\n\u201cHe was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice,\u201d Harris said in a tweet. \u201cHe must be impeached.\u201d\n\nWarren tweeted: \u201cLast year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.\u201d\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden released a statement calling for further investigation. \u201cWe need to get to the bottom of whether the Trump administration and Senate Republicans pressured the FBI to ignore evidence or prevented them from following up on leads,\u201d it said.\n\nKavanaugh\u2019s bitter confirmation hearing captivated and divided the nation last fall. The hearings were dominated by Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s account, first reported by The Post, that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her while they were high school students in the 1980s. Kavanaugh strenuously denied Ford\u2019s claim, calling it an \u201corchestrated political hit.\u201d\n\nThe new claim echoes an allegation made by a different female Yale student, Deborah Ramirez, during Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation process. Kavanaugh has denied that allegation.\n\nShortly before the scheduled vote on his nomination, the Trump administration asked the FBI to investigate those allegations, though the inquiry was restricted in scope. The FBI interviewed fewer than a dozen people \u2014 most of them from Kavanaugh\u2019s high school days. They interviewed Ramirez.\n\nAs the FBI was wrapping up its investigation, the intermediaries working on behalf of Stier delivered his account to agency officials. The intermediaries told The Post last year they had relayed that a classmate of Kavanaugh had witnessed the incident while taking a study break at Yale\u2019s Lawrance Hall. They declined to give The Post the classmate\u2019s name.\n\nNo one from the FBI called the classmate to follow up on the account, they said.\n\nThe Post could not independently corroborate the allegation. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the witness had not authorized them to use their names.\n\nThe Times on Saturday identified the witness as Stier, chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service. The Times story was based on research for a book, \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation,\u201d by two of its reporters. According to the book, at least two senators on the Judiciary Committee learned of Stier\u2019s allegations.\n\nLast fall, the intermediaries told The Post they shared the account with a veteran FBI agent, who assured them it would be passed on to officials directly responsible for Kavanaugh\u2019s background check. They said the witness also shared his account with a Senate Judiciary Committee member who offered assurance that it would be passed on directly to officials responsible for the background check.\n\nMike Davis, who was chief counsel for Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) during the Kavanaugh nomination process, said that to the best of his knowledge, Grassley\u2019s office has no record of Stier reaching out with his allegation.\n\n\u201cEven if we did receive an allegation from Mr. Stier as described by the New York Times reporting, it is difficult to see how this unsubstantiated hearsay, \u2018corroborated\u2019 by anonymous sources, involving an alleged victim who other unnamed sources said does not even remember the event, would have changed the outcome of the confirmation vote,\u201d said Davis, who now leads the Article III Project, an advocacy group that promotes Trump\u2019s judicial picks.\n\nEven before Stier\u2019s account was made public, the background check had drawn criticism from some quarters for its highly curtailed scope. Agents did not interview Ford, a professor in California who alleged Kavanaugh assaulted her decades ago in Maryland.\n\nThe account attributed to Stier bears similarities to the claims made by Ramirez, who accused Kavanaugh of thrusting his p***s in her face at a drunken party, causing her to touch it without her consent. Ramirez\u2019s representatives provided agents with the names of over 20 people they said may have information relevant to her claims. During the background check, Ramirez\u2019s team had no indication that the bureau had interviewed any of them.\n\nRamirez\u2019s account was first published by the New Yorker last year. The magazine said that Ramirez in their initial conversations was reluctant to characterize Kavanaugh\u2019s role in the incident, but that she grew more confident after assessing her memories and consulting with an attorney.\n\nIn their Saturday article, the Times reporters said they spoke with at least seven people who supported Ramirez\u2019s account, including two classmates who heard about the incident shortly after it allegedly occurred. Ramirez\u2019s mother told the reporters she had heard about the Yale incident long before Kavanaugh was a federal judge. The other people whose accounts supported Ramirez were not identified in the Times story.\n\nAn FBI spokeswoman declined to comment Sunday on the Kavanaugh background investigation.\n\nAt a Senate hearing later that year, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray defended his agency\u2019s handling of the issue.\n\n\u201cAs is standard, the investigation was very specific in scope, limited in scope, and that is the usual process,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cmy folks have assured me that the usual process was followed.\u201d\n\nemily.wax@washpost.com\n\ncat.zakrzewski@washpost.com\n\nrobert.oharrow@washpost.com\n\nSeung Min Kim, Sean Sullivan, Amy Gardner, Bob Barnes and Devlin Barrett contributed to this report.", "description": "The essay suggests the FBI\u2019s investigation into prior sexual assault claims was not thorough.", "authors": [], "top_image": ""}
