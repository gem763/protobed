A handover is underway, she said.\n\nEskom reintroduced load shedding due to a shortage of capacity that followed the failure of a conveyor belt supplying Medupi power station in Limpopo with coal.\n\nIn addition, five electricity generating units are unavailable due to boiler tube leaks.\n\nThe conveyer belt at Medupi will be repaired by end of the week, Eskom said.\n\nEarlier, energy analyst Chris Yelland tweeted that Van der Wal had been force to step down, something Eskom has denied.\n\nOn Sunday, the power generator communicated that supply constrained, stating that no outages were expected on Monday and the probability of load shedding was low for the week.\n\nThe company also said it had replenished diesel reserves for the open cycle gas turbines and to increase water levels at its pumped storage schemes in preparation for the week ahead.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa has weighed in on the impact of power cuts, saying they \"contributes to investor unease at a time when we are trying to attract more domestic and foreign capital to South Africa and to improve our global rankings on ease of doing business\".", "description": "But Eskom said the power system remains constrained, and load shedding may be implemented at short notice.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9182/0be230dde8dd43b389ebef971eb26bf8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
