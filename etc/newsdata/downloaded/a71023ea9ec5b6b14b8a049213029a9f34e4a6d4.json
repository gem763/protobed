Cory Booker\u2019s presidential campaign warned Saturday in a memo that he \"might not be in this race for much longer\" if there's no fundraising surge by the end of this quarter \u2013 which is in just 10 days.\n\nAddisu Demissie, Booker's campaign manager, wrote to the senator\u2019s supporters saying that \"Cory 2020 needs to raise an additional $1.7 million by September 30 to be in a position to build the organization necessary to continue competing for the nomination. Without a fundraising surge to close out this quarter, we do not see a legitimate long-term path forward.\"\n\n\u201cThe next 10 days will determine whether Cory Booker can stay in this race and compete to win the nomination,\u201d the memo states.\n\nCurrently, Booker is not polling in the top five candidates, a group that has been consistently dominated by former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Kamala Harris, as well as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nI wrote a thing. This isn\u2019t an end-of-quarter stunt or one of those memos from a campaign trying to spin the press. This is the truth: @CoryBooker has the resources necessary to continue on as we are now, but need to raise $1.7M in 10 days to grow to win. https://t.co/CIngql2YNE \u2014 Addisu Demissie (@ASDem) September 21, 2019\n\nBooker has already qualified for the October DNC debates, and the memo noted that he raised $1.4 million in the final 10 days of March to end the first quarter. The memo also mentioned that \u201cother important voices in the field\u201d are facing similar dilemmas with current fundraising.\n\nDemissie explained the campaign has the money to continue at the current pace, but they need more to \u201cscale up\u201d operations before voting starts early next year, reiterating that his candidate doesn't have the desire to continue running if he doesn't think he can win.\n\nIt mentions that \u201conly four campaigns\u201d have the \"money necessary to build and sustain the national organization needed to win,\" referring to some of those top candidates.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t among them today, but with your help, we can be,\u201d the memo reads, adding the campaign knows it will be a \u201cherculean challenge\u201d to raise $1.7 million in a little more than a week.\n\nDemissie wrote that if the \u201ccampaign is not in a financial position to grow\" Booker is \"not going to continue to consume resources and attention that can be used to focus on beating Donald Trump, which needs to be everyone's first priority.\u201d\n\nBooker acknowledged the memo on Twitter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unusual move for a campaign like ours to be this transparent, but there can be no courage without vulnerability,\u201d he wrote Saturday. \u201cI want people to see where we are and understand that we have a pathway to victory, but I can\u2019t walk it alone.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an unusual move for a campaign like ours to be this transparent, but there can be no courage without vulnerability.
