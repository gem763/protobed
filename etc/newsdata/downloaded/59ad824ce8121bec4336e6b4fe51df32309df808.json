Children have died, people have died. ... We're going to have some very strong rules, regulations, and more important I think we're going to have some very important information come out very shortly. And we'll be reporting that over the next couple of weeks.\"\n\nVape shop owners who spoke to FOX Business estimated that flavored e-cigarette cartridges commonly called e-liquid or \u201cvape juice\u201d account for somewhere between 85 and 95 percent of their sales. Owners like Danny Canceleno of The Salty Vapor in Daphne, Alabama, said a ban of those products would gut their businesses and force them to close.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt will close my doors,\u201d he said. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nThe CDC hasn\u2019t caused the specific cause of the lung illnesses it\u2019s investigating, but it recommends that people refrain from using e-cigarettes in the meantime.\n\nBut vape store professionals said the products they sell aren\u2019t the ones causing the illnesses, and they\u2019re just being scapegoated because of legal gray areas around the real issues: online sales and marijuana.\n\nChris Dofort, who owns Vapor Life in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Vape 45 in Hudson, North Carolina, said online markets allow unsafe vaping products from overseas to reach U.S. customers, including underage consumers. His stores and others like them check customers\u2019 IDs to ensure they\u2019re of age, and he said they face undercover enforcement just like liquor stores.\n\n\u201cVape stores do not want to sell to underage kids,\u201d Dofort said.\n\nStill, teens are vaping. About 4.9 million middle and high school students said they were current users of e-cigarettes last year, according to the FDA.\n\nBennett Kennedy, the operations manager for a chain of vape shops in North Carolina, questioned why officials wouldn\u2019t just ban online e-cigarette sales.\n\n\u201cWhen a customer comes into the store, they\u2019re IDed and no one underage can buy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they buy online, nothing is stopping them.\u201d\n\nKennedy said his shops only carry products from brands that follow FDA guidelines. People are getting sick, he said, by vaping homemade concoctions or illegal cartridges with THC.\n\nTHC cartridges present officials with a problem. Because marijuana is still illegal at the federal level, the FDA can\u2019t regulate them. But since some states have legalized marijuana, they\u2019re still being sold in some locally-legal dispensaries. A widespread flavor ban could take them off shelves.\n\nBy closing vape shops with a widespread ban, Canceleno, the Alabama store owner, said officials could inadvertently create a black market fueled by home manufacturers selling dangerous products, worsening the lung health problem.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nShop owners said they were trying to drum up opposition to the ban. Dofort said he\u2019d \u201csigned every petition that\u2019s been made.\u201d Canceleno tagged the president in a Facebook post and called the White House to express his concerns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to close 10,000 shops and 110,000 people are going to be out of work, and that doesn\u2019t include the manufacturers and distributors,\u201d Canceleno said. \u201cThe government is overreaching.\u201d", "description": "Vape shop owners are worried a Trump administration proposal to ban all non-tobacco flavors of e-cigarettes could kneecap the $6 billion-a-year industry.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Vaping.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
