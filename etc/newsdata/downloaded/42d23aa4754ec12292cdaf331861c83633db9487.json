The programmes have similar formats, airing viewers\u2019 concerns about BBC content and interviews with the executives responsible.\n\nThe BBC said that the roles were not equal because Points of View has a long history as a popular entertainment programme, and Vine is a household name.\n\nAhmed is the first BBC presenter to take her equal pay claim all the way to tribunal in a movement that began when the corporation was compelled to publish details of its gender pay gap in 2017, sparking a revolt by women employees.", "description": "A dozen BBC women are poised to take the corporation to tribunal over equal pay, it emerged on Monday, as Samira Ahmed launched a landmark case for \u00a3500,000 in back pay.", "authors": ["Anita Singh", "Telegraph View", "William Hague"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/28/TELEMMGLPICT000214394992-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqhJ9OF22R61zNdPttfFPBIKsXVjD1YkuhNUMuJ1fa8FM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
