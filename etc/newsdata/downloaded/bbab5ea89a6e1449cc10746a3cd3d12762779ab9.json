Although all the world\u2019s major equity regions are reporting year-to-date gains, U.S. shares continue to lead, in most cases by a wide margin, based on a set of exchange traded products.\n\nThe dominance of U.S. shares is all the more striking in the wake of surging political risk of late, courtesy of a drive by Democrats in the House of Representatives to impeach President Donald Trump. The president, in fact, tweeted yesterday that \u201cIf they actually did this [impeach him] the markets would crash.\u201d\n\nPerhaps, but for now the U.S. market is relatively calm, holding near a record high, based on the . In relative terms, U.S. equities are no less impressive.\n\nSPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: ), a proxy for U.S. shares, closed yesterday (Sept. 26) with a 20.5% year-to-date return. In close pursuit for 2019 performance is Central and Eastern Europe (NYSE: ), a closed-end fund that offers the only U.S.-exchange-listed product that targets this region.

The capitalization-weighted Vanguard Total World Stock (VT), with a dominant U.S. weight of roughly 56%, is up 16.6% on a total return basis year to date.\n\nAlthough all the major equity regions are sitting on gains this year, profiling the field through a momentum lens paints a mixed picture, based on a set of moving averages. The first compares the 10-day average with its 100-day counterpart \u2014 a proxy for short-term trending behavior (red line in chart below). A second set of moving averages (50 and 200 days) represent an intermediate measure of the trend (blue line). Using these two metrics as a guide suggests that the crowd is betwixt and between on the outlook for equities on a global basis.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by James Picerno covering: S&P 500, SPDR S&P 500, Central Europe Russia & Turkey Fund.
