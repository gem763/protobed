REUTERS/Tom Brenner\n\nMueller, 75, is rejoining WilmerHale as a partner focused on high-profile investigations and crisis management, similar to his work prior to becoming special counsel, the law firm said on Tuesday.\n\nTwo other lawyers who left WilmerHale to work in the special counsel\u2019s office, James Quarles and Aaron Zebley, are also returning, as partners. The law firm has about 1,000 lawyers.\n\n\u201cIt was an honor to serve as special counsel,\u201d Mueller said in a statement provided by the firm. \u201cI look forward to resuming my private practice.\u201d\n\nMueller was a WilmerHale partner in Washington for three years before his May 2017 appointment as special counsel, and had been a partner at a predecessor firm in the mid-1990s.\n\nHe was also FBI director from 2001 to 2013, becoming that agency\u2019s longest-serving director other than J. Edgar Hoover.\n\nMueller spent 22 months investigating what he concluded was \u201csweeping\u201d Russian interference in the 2016 election, and told Congress on July 24 that Russia would keep trying to interfere in U.S. elections.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing it as we sit here,\u201d Mueller said, \u201cand they expect to do it during the next campaign.\u201d\n\nThe probe also focused on Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to impede the inquiry.\n\nWhile the president said a special counsel report released in April was a \u201ccomplete and total exoneration\u201d of him, Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether Trump committed the crime of obstruction of justice.\n\nThe report also said Mueller found insufficient evidence to establish that Trump and his campaign had engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Russia.", "description": "Robert Mueller, the former special counsel who oversaw a two-year probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election to help Donald Trump become president, is returning to his old law firm.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1436035117&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF90363", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
