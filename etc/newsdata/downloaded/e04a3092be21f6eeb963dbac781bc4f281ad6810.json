Instead, Giuliani said the Ukrainians had to promise to pursue two specific investigations that could damage the president\u2019s political domestic adversaries.\n\nWhile Giuliani\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine have been known, Volker\u2019s account to House committees conducting an impeachment inquiry provides new details about how the president\u2019s personal lawyer inserted himself into foreign policy to benefit Trump politically. Not only was Giuliani meeting with Ukrainian officials, he was effectively dictating the contents of a statement being negotiated by State Department officials with a foreign power.\n\nGiuliani \u201csaid that in his view, the statement should include specific reference to \u2018Burisma\u2019 and \u20182016,\u2019\u201d Volker told House investigators, according to a copy of his prepared testimony provided by a person involved in the process who did not want to be named. \u201cThere was no mention of Vice President Biden in these conversations.\u201d\n\nBut Burisma was the Ukrainian energy company on whose board Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden served for $50,000 a month, and the Ukrainians clearly understood that Giuliani\u2019s interest in an investigation into the firm was aimed at finding damaging information about the former vice president, who had led dealings with Ukraine while in office.\n\n\u201cI edited the draft statement by Mr. Yermak to include these points to see how it looked,\u201d Volker testified, referring to Andrey Yermak, a top adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine. \u201cI then discussed further with Mr. Yermak. He said that for a number of reasons\u201d that \u201cthey do not want to mention Burisma and 2016.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agreed,\u201d Volker added, \u201cand further said that I believe it is essential that Ukraine do nothing that could be seen as interfering in 2020 elections. It is bad enough that accusations have been made about 2016 \u2014 it is essential that Ukraine not be involved in anything relating to 2020. He agreed and the idea of putting out a statement was shelved.\u201d\n\nVolker\u2019s testimony has attracted enormous interest as the first person to testify about the Ukraine matter since Speaker Nancy Pelosi opened a formal impeachment inquiry. An ambassador to NATO under President George W. Bush, Volker was serving as special envoy part time without pay but abruptly resigned last week after revelations about the president\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine for an investigation into Biden.\n\nVolker also plans to resign Friday as executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership, a Washington-based research group affiliated with Arizona State University. The institute leadership has privately expressed discontent with his twin roles, complaining that he was not as forthcoming as they wished, and pressured Volker to step down.\n\nA person familiar with Volker\u2019s views said he was planning to leave later this year and decided to go right away to avoid being a distraction for the institute as a result of the furor over the Ukraine matter and impeachment inquiry.\n\nFor Volker, it has been a week of many transitions. He is also scheduled to get married in Washington on Saturday.\n\nIn his testimony Thursday, Volker emphasized to congressional investigators that he was kept out of the loop on the president\u2019s efforts to prompt an investigation of Biden and was not on Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelenskiy that has sparked the impeachment inquiry.\n\nVolker sought in his testimony to distance himself from the pressure campaign by the president and Giuliani. \u201cAt no time was I aware of or took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden,\u201d he told investigators.\n\n\u201cMoreover,\u201d he added, \u201cas I was aware of public accusations about the vice president, several times I cautioned the Ukrainians to distinguish between highlighting their own efforts to fight corruption domestically, including investigating Ukrainian individuals \u2014 something we support as a matter of U.S. policy \u2014 and doing anything that could be seen as impacting U.S. elections, which is in neither the United States\u2019 nor Ukraine\u2019s own interests.\u201d", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The former State Department special envoy for Ukraine told congressional investigators that Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal attorney, demanded that Ukraine specifically commit to investigate involvement in the 2016 election and a firm tied to former Vice President Joe", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SMp2f8k1qmhwtSWfTz0fzw--~B/aD0zNjY5O3c9NTUwNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/94dec36f3523dcb50facd8cfb925c889", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
