Trouble came for Wolf in May during an interview with BBC radio host Matthew Sweet. Wolf told Sweet that her new book, Outrages: Sex, Censorship, and the Criminalization of Love, delves into evidence she found of \u201cseveral dozen executions\u201d of men convicted of sodomy in Britain, which she inaccurately claimed \u201ccorrects a misapprehension \u2026 that the last man was executed for sodomy in Britain in 1835.\u201d But as Sweet pointed out, Wolf based much of her thesis on a misapprehension of the phrase \u201cdeath recorded,\u201d which she took to signify \u201cexecution\u201d when in fact it meant the exact opposite thing \u2014 that the prisoner had been pardoned. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of the executions you\u2019ve identified here actually happened,\u201d Sweet informed her. He added that in the court records Wolf researched, \u201csodomy\u201d referred not only to homosexuality but to child abuse as well.\n\nEveryone listen to Naomi Wolf realize on live radio that the historical thesis of the book she's there to promote is based on her misunderstanding a legal term pic.twitter.com/a3tB77g3c1 \u2014 Edmund Hochreiter (@thymetikon) May 23, 2019\n\nWolf\u2019s publisher had already pushed back the U.S. release date for Outrages in June. (Outrages was published in the U.K. by Hatchette Book Group\u2019s Virago Press ahead of the blunder, so the book exists, just not as much of it as Wolf surely hoped.) In a statement, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt said Wolf and the publisher \u201cmutually and amicably agreed to part company,\u201d the New York Times reports.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Wolf has been accused of being rather cavalier with facts. As the Times\u2019 book critic, Parul Sehgal, notes in her review of Outrages, Wolf\u2019s first book, The Beauty Myth, published in 1990, \u201cis well-known for exaggerating the number of women who died of anorexia (Wolf stated that anorexia kills 150,000 women annually; the actual figure at the time, in the mid-1990s, was said to be closer to 50 or 60).\u201d Sehgal writes of her 2012 book, Vagina, that it, \u201cso profoundly misrepresented the working of the brain, I\u2019m not sure science writers have recovered.\u201d\n\nThis is indicative of a larger problem: Books are often not fact-checked, or not thoroughly enough, sometimes because publishers rely on authors to check their own manuscripts. As the Times notes, its former executive editor Jill Abramson, as well as the journalist Michael Wolff, recently also wrote high-profile books that were found to be riddled with errors.", "description": "Naomi Wolf\u2019s latest book \u201cOutrages\u201d has been canceled after the author found out mid-interview that some of her research was incorrect.", "authors": ["Hannah Gold"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/05/24/24-naomi-wolf.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
