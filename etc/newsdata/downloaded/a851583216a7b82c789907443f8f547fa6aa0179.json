Though a weak student, whose poor eyesight disqualified him from joining the Iraqi military, he rose to command al-Qaeda\u2019s Iraqi division and then broke away to form Islamic State (Isis).\n\nIn July 2014, shortly after Isis said it had established a caliphate in Iraq and Syria, Baghdadi delivered a sermon from a mosque in the captured Iraqi city of Mosul. Appearing unmasked for the first time, he declared himself to be the caliph: the political and religious leader of the global Muslim community.\n\nHis declaration was roundly rejected by almost all Islamic religious authorities but his caliphate became a magnet for thousands of foreign fighters and women. The group attempted not just to hold territory but to administer it like a state, establishing a brutal justice system, collecting taxes and doling out public services.\n\nBaghdadi has been seen publicly on one other occasion, in an 18-minute video released in April this year. Since 2016 he has had a $25m bounty on his head.\n\nHe has been reported to have suffered serious injuries in airstrikes over the years and there has occasionally been speculation that he has been killed, but he continued to resurface in audio tapes and videos.\n\nWhy would his death be significant?\n\nIn March, Isis surrendered its final territorial stronghold in the Syrian city of Baghouz, a deep material blow but also a symbolic one, depriving the group of its ability to claim legitimacy as a restored Islamic caliphate.\n\nThe defeat prompted Baghdadi\u2019s first public appearance in five years in a video that was interpreted as an attempt to fortify his leadership \u2013 in the face of dissent within the ranks \u2013 and to demonstrate that the group continued to exist even without its territory.\n\nBaghdadi is not just an operational leader, but a symbol of Isis\u2019s Islamic credentials: he has claimed to come from the same tribe as the prophet Muhammad, to be a descendant of the prophet\u2019s grandson, and to fulfil the necessary ideological and religious tests rightfully to claim leadership of Muslims.\n\nHis death would be another strike against Isis\u2019 purported legitimacy, leaving it less able to claim to be any different from other violent extremist groups.\n\nWhat is the evidence that he was killed?\n\nThe US government, which reportedly carried out an operation targeting Baghdadi on Saturday night, is yet to announce anything publicly. Donald Trump is scheduled to make an announcement at 9am Washington DC time on Sunday morning.\n\nReports quoting anonymous American, Iranian and Iraqi officials have said US forces killed Baghdadi in an attack on Saturday night in the town of Barisha in the Syria province of Idlib. Video posted from the town shows a building that has been reduced to rubble, bodies scattered in the area and deep craters in the ground.\n\nTurkish and Kurdish officials have both claimed to have coordinated with the US, though neither has said its fighters were actually part of the operation. Newsweek reported that the attack was carried by Delta Force, an elite US-army special-operations unit.\n\nTrump tweeted at 9.23pm Washington DC time (3.23am in Idlib): \u201cSomething very big has just happened!\u201d\n\nWas he known to be in this area?\n\nBaghdadi had been thought to have been hiding in eastern Syria along the border with his native Iraq. He is said to use extensive measures to avoid surveillance, never using mobile phones, frequently changing safe houses and avoiding travelling in convoys that might draw attention.\n\nFew would guess that he was in Idlib because the province, which is under siege by Russian and Syrian forces, is mostly controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist militia that is opposed to Isis and has been known to hunt down and execute suspected members of the group.\n\nSome have speculated that if Baghdadi were in Idlib, he might have arrived recently, fleeing the recent Turkish incursion in the north-east of the country, and the subsequent advances made by the Syrian and Russian armies.", "description": "Self-declared caliph not just operational leader of Isis but a symbol of its Islamic credentials", "authors": ["Michael Safi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb5a71611a8ff8af8622d687369eca93dee7b0e1/573_120_1459_876/master/1459.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f74eaa51a51acc2cf007f2e2ce389df0", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
