However, Scarborough said Trump was the origin of those chants.\n\n\u201c[T]here is a very long and rich tradition of presidents being booed at sporting events \u2014 most of them do,\u201d Scarborough said. \u201cI would speak to the lock him up chants. Again, it is un-American. It started with Donald Trump. In fact, he\u2019s made it a centerpiece of his campaign rallies.\u201d\n\nScarborough went on to say he hoped everyone would learn their lesson, including Trump and his supporters, from the occasion.\n\n\u201cSickening, we are Americans,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd we do not do that. We do not want the world hearing us chant \u2018lock him up\u2019 to this president, or to any president, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, let\u2019s hope, as we move forward, maybe this is one less fascist tactic he and his supporters use, during chants. You are going to actually imprison your political opponents. So let\u2019s leave that behind.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "description": "The \"lock him up\" chants at game five of the World Series in Washington, D.C. on Sunday was too much for even chronic Donald Trump critics Joe Scarborough | Clips", "authors": ["Jeff Poor"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Scarborough1028-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
