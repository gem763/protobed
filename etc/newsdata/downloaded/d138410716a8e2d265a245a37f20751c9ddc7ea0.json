Although they aren\u2019t widely used now, groups once served as a watering hole for discussion on wonderfully niche interests, such as TV show fan communities and extremely geeky computing topics \u2014 almost like Reddit does now. Looking through the directory today, you can still find groups with thousands of members, and some groups have been active as recently as this year.\n\nSadly, it seems that almost all of that internet history is going to be erased. In a support document, Yahoo says that, effective December 14th, it will be deleting all content that has been posted to Yahoo Groups. And it\u2019s going to largely shut down the service even sooner, as you won\u2019t be able to upload new content to your groups starting this Monday, October 21st.\n\nOnce the old content is deleted, all you\u2019ll be able to do on Yahoo Groups is browse the groups directory, request to be invited to one, and, if you\u2019re in a group, email that group.\n\nHere\u2019s Yahoo\u2019s list of what it will remove:\n\nFiles\n\nPolls\n\nLinks\n\nPhotos\n\nFolders\n\nCalendar\n\nDatabase\n\nAttachments\n\nConversations\n\nEmail Updates\n\nMessage Digest\n\nMessage History\n\nGroups will also become much harder to join. As part of the changes, Yahoo says that any currently public group will become restricted or private. You can still find them, but you may only be able to join by invitation.\n\nIt seems like the beginning of the end for Yahoo Groups\n\nIf you want to save content from a group before it is removed, Yahoo says you can download your files directly from your group\u2019s page, or by going to Verizon Media\u2019s Privacy Dashboard page, signing into your Yahoo account, and requesting your group\u2019s data. (Yahoo says it will email you once your data is ready for download.) And some of the content may get preserved by the Internet Archive, according to archivist Jason Scott:\n\nOf COURSE Archive Team is going to go after it. We will take a huge-ass snapshot, and people will lose ALL the functionality of access, search, reference. That's the price that's paid - we turn things into snapshots instead of reference books and living things. \u2014 Jason Scott (@textfiles) October 16, 2019\n\nTo my surprise, I realized while researching this story that this news might personally affect me. For years, I\u2019ve gotten score updates for a competitive summer marching band circuit (shoutout to my band nerds) \u2014 and I remembered that the updates come from a Yahoo group I joined ages ago. Since group emails will still work, I\u2019ll be able to keep getting those scores every summer, for now.\n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Yahoo shut down groups completely sometime in the future \u2014 either way, it feels like an important part of internet history is about to disappear.", "description": "Yahoo says that, effective December 14th, it will be deleting all content that has been posted to Yahoo Groups.
