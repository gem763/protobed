But the missiles and launch platforms that would theoretically be used to deliver those warheads from air, land or sea are too old and badly need to be replaced, former officials say.\n\nAD\n\nThe \u201cnuclear triad\u201d \u2015 which includes ground, air and sea-launched missiles \u2015 is meant to deter a potential enemy such as Russia, China or North Korea from launching a nuclear first strike by sending a message that whichever nation moves first would be immediately destroyed.\n\nAD\n\nThe ballistic missile program\u2019s recent troubles add to a laundry list of obstacles facing the nuclear triad recapitalization plan.\n\nA separate effort to buy new air-launched cruise missiles faces opposition from newly empowered congressional Democrats, who worry that they could fuel an arms race. And the Navy is having problems with the Columbia-class nuclear submarine that is to make up the sea-based launch capability, as faulty welding has caused problems with the submarines\u2019 missile tubes.\n\nAD\n\nThere is a concern that the falling-out between the Air Force and Boeing could give Northrop Grumman too much influence over the Pentagon\u2019s missile programs moving forward.\n\n\u201cFrom a taxpayer\u2019s point of view, when there are multiple companies competing for something, it\u2019s going to drive prices down,\u201d said Dan Grazier, a retired Marine Corps captain who now works with the nonprofit Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog group. \u201cIt bothers me immensely that so many of these systems go to a sole-source provider, because there is no incentive to control costs.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe squabble among Boeing, Northrop and the Air Force grew out of a weapons development competition that started years ago.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2017 the Air Force started paying Boeing and Northrop to develop competing missiles, hoping to weigh the two offerings and negotiate a fair price. That same year, Northrop spent $7.8 billion to acquire a company called Orbital ATK, which is a dominant producer of rocket motors. Boeing unsuccessfully petitioned the Pentagon and the Federal Trade Commission to block the acquisition.\n\nHaving failed to block its competitors from teaming up, Boeing subsequently announced that it would decline to participate in the next phase of the competition.\n\nMore recently, Boeing has been lobbying the Pentagon and Congress to force a teaming arrangement that would give it some portion of the missile work. Boeing had previously asked Northrop to join forces and was refused.\n\nThe Air Force\u2019s decision to halt funding could be a sign that it doesn\u2019t want to force a teaming arrangement.\n\nTeal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said he thinks the Air Force has \u201cmade it clear that they don\u2019t want Boeing to be a part of the bid,\u201d adding: \u201cIt was always kind of a forlorn hope that [Boeing] would get some kind of mandatory carve-out.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The decision means an $85 billion ballistic missile program has only one likely bidder.", "authors": ["Aaron Gregg", "Reporter Covering The Defense Industry", "Commercial Aviation", "Government Contractors."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lBj1Ql7Jk-3xXT5bUlFzmsZVlk8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B7N7X3HFFYI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
