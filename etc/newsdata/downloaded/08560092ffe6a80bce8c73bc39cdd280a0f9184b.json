He would put on shows in the backyard of his home in Elmont, NY, for anyone who would watch, and when it was time for college, he chose theater as his major. But a few words from his father shifted the course of his path.\n\n\u201cWe were driving to D.C. and he said, \u2018Marc, you can do whatever you want with your life, and I will totally support you, but I know you; you\u2019re not going to be happy not making money. You\u2019re so good with your hands, you should become a dentist like your Uncle Sam.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen they arrived on campus, Lowenberg changed his major to premed.\n\nWhen he wasn\u2019t performing, young Lowenberg was using his hands, building model airplanes, trains, and cars. Ironically, they failed him during a crucial part of the dentistry exam. Candidates were given a bar of chalk, from which they had to carve a geometric figure.\n\n\u201cI broke the chalk. That\u2019s an automatic zero, and it\u2019s like the bar exam. I would have had to wait a year to take it again,\u201d he explains. \u201cFortunately, I was the only pre-dent student at American University, so the dean wrote a letter to the dean of NYU dental school, and somehow I was allowed to take the test again.\u201d\n\nThis time, the chalk didn\u2019t break. And today, the patient list of Lowenberg, Lituchy & Kantor reads like the table of contents of Vanity Fair. It\u2019s not uncommon to spot a recognizable politician, actor, or musician in the Central Park South waiting room, where Lowenberg has been since 1973. The practice recently underwent a major renovation, largely to make room for its newest member, ceramist Jason Kim.\n\n\u201cWe met him 25 years ago and it was clear he was super talented,\u201d says Lowenberg. \u201cEvery dentist wanted him, so we broached the idea of building him a lab and he joined us. Most veneers are created digitally, but he does everything by hand. If a color is a little off on a tooth, he\u2019ll come upstairs and fix it.\u201d\n\nA few years ago, Lowenberg returned to his first love. An Off Broadway producer patient invited him to direct a one-act play. His father flew up for opening night.\n\n\u201cHe came up to me afterwards with tears in his eyes,\u201d remembers Lowenberg. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, I should have believed in you.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Are you crazy?? I hated every second of it!\u2019\u201d laughs Lowenberg at the memory. \u201cBeing a dentist is what I was born to do.\u201d\n\nLowenberg spoke with the Cut about his refusal to go fully gray, the way he shocked his colleagues in the \u201980s, and which of his patients always, always floss.\n\nWhat\u2019s your definition of beauty?\n\nAnything in the universe that takes my breath away.\n\nWhat do you think when you hear the term \u201cclean beauty\u201d?\n\nThe beauty industry has come a long way. Brands are more aware of what they\u2019re putting in their products, and where/how they\u2019re sourcing the ingredients.\n\nWhere, if anywhere, in your beauty (or life) routine are you not quite that \u201cclean,\u201d \u201cgreen,\u201d or \u201csustainable\u201d?\n\nI refuse to go fully gray so I tone down the gray in my hair with lowlights.\n\nPlease fill in the blank as it pertains to something connected to your beauty, self, routine \u2014 product or otherwise: I think about _____ a lot:\n\nMy hair.

The rest? I\u2019d say only about 30 percent.\n\nScent of choice:\n\nTom Ford Grey Vetiver.\n\nPreferred sunscreen and SPF #:\n\nMD Solar Sciences Mineral Cr\u00e8me SPF30.\n\nDeodorant of choice:\n\nMalin and Goetz Eucalyptus Deodorant.\n\nRazor of choice:\n\nBaByliss Pro Beard Trimmer.\n\nBath or shower?\n\nShower, with Irish Spring.\n\nShampoo/Conditioner of choice:\n\nOribe Gold Lust Shampoo & Conditioner.\n\nWhat was your first grooming product?

What did you learn from it?\n\nWhen I first started doing porcelain veneers in the \u201980s, every dentist said \u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201d because it wasn\u2019t taught in dental school. What I learned was that you have to believe in yourself and your own integrity.\n\nPlease share a moment from your career that touched you.\n\nThere have been so many, but they all have the same theme: People who suffer from low self-esteem because of the condition and appearance of their teeth.
