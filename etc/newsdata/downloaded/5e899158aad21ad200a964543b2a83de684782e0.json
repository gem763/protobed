Social Democrat leader Rui Rio conceded defeat.\n\nThe parliament chooses a government, usually taken from the party that has the most lawmakers.\n\nIt remained unclear, however, if the Socialists would get a parliamentary majority.\n\nThat could mean they would take power as a minority government or pursue a governing alliance with other left-of-center parties \u2014 as they did in their last term with the Portuguese Communist Party and the radical Left Bloc.\n\n___\n\n8 p.m.\n\nAn exit poll indicates the center-left Socialist Party has collected the most votes in Portugal\u2019s general election and is poised to continue in government for another four years.\n\nThe estimate, published by the S.I.C. television channel, projects that the Socialists will capture 36-40% of Sunday\u2019s vote. It says the main opposition Social Democratic Party will get 24-28%.\n\nIt gives the radical Left Bloc 9-12%, the Portuguese Communist Party 5-7% and the Christian Democrats 2.4-5%\n\nIt estimates turnout at 48.5-52.5%, which would be a record low.\n\nThe exit poll by Lisbon University\u2019s public survey department was based on asking people leaving polling stations how they had voted. The result was roughly in line with opinion polls published before the election.\n\n___\n\n8:15 a.m.\n\nPortugal is holding a general election, with the center-left Socialist Party widely expected to collect most votes and stay in government for another four years.\n\nThe Socialists have overseen a strong economic recovery, with unemployment dropping by around half, to 6%, over its term. They have also started straightening out Portugal\u2019s ill-managed public finances.\n\nThe main opposition Social Democrats party is still associated with the deep cutbacks and a three-year recession that ended in 2014, when the center-right party was in power.\n\nRecent opinion polls have indicated that the Socialists will fall short of a majority in parliament. That means they may have to negotiate alliances with smaller left-of-center parties, as they did in their last term, to pass legislation.\n\nSunday\u2019s ballot is open to around 10.8 million eligible voters.", "description": "LISBON, Portugal (AP) \u2014 The latest on Portugal's election (all times local): 11:55 p.m. Portugal's center-left Socialist Party has collected the most", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/06/384138_portugal-election-81332-supporters-portuguese-prime-minister-socialist-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
