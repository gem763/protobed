And that means inflation expectations have started to fall.\"\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, policymakers were worried about getting inflation back under control. Now, it's the other way around.\n\n\"If inflation expectations go towards zero or potentially below zero, you're in deflation, you're in Japan. It's almost impossible to get out of that.\"\n\nNAB's head of fixed income research, Skye Masters, said there were some areas where there might soon be an inflationary response.\n\n\"Rents have been a massive drag on inflation in the last few years. One positive that says we are at the end and inflation is now starting to look up is that rents are bottoming or starting to pick up,\" Ms Masters said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two largest housing-related components of the consumer price index basket are rents and new dwelling purchases by owner-occupiers.\n\nThey account for about one-sixth of the CPI basket.\n\nEconomists expect the all important CPI reading next week will show the the annual rate remaining at 1.6 per cent. Lower fuel and energy prices have contributed to lower readings more recently and are likely to again.\n\nThe so-called \"default market offers\" for energy in NSW, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia are again expected to keep prices down in the September quarter.\n\nThis all points to further interest rate cuts from the Reserve Bank. which has been focused on trying to reduce unemployment to the point where wages start to grow and people start to spend more and push up inflation.\n\n\"It is reasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates will be required in Australia to reach full employment and achieve the inflation target,\" the Reserve Bank said after cutting the interest rate to a record 0.75 per cent in October.", "description": "Economists' expectations about inflation are becoming a major concern for central bankers and could result in consumers holding off on spending.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2324%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_22%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/bbdf7c9b47d6b614daf3cf3dc26c18db85dca701", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
