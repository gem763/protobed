The science is clear \u2013 it tells us that trans women have an advantage.\n\n\"It is a human right to participate in sport. I don't think it's a human right to identify into whichever category you choose.\"\n\nIn response, McKinnon said: \"We are either full and equal women, or not. We are.\"\n\nShe also branded tennis great Martina Navratilova \"transphobic\" after she said allowing transgender women to compete against people born as women was \"insane\" and \"cheating\" and she accused runner Paula Radcliffe of spreading \"irrational fear\" over voicing similar concerns.", "description": "Rachel McKinnon slammed Dawn Orwick for her reaction after she won her second world title in Manchester", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20701912.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_CYCLING-ENG-TRACK-WORLD-GENDER.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
