According to the presentation, the currency would be widely available. It would initially coexist with coins and paper money, eventually replacing them completely.\n\nThe presentation, titled \u201cCentral Bank Money: The Next Generation\u201d and acquired by The Logic via an access-to-information request, was prepared by Stephen Murchison, an adviser to Poloz tasked with leading the bank\u2019s digital currency research, for a September 2018 board meeting. Murchison presented it as part of a two-year research project on whether or not the bank should issue its own digital money.\n\nIt emerges at a moment of heightened concern over the implications of digital money. Global regulators and central bankers \u2014 including representatives from Canada \u2014 are gathered this week in Washington, D.C. at the annual joint World Bank/International Monetary Fund meetings, which include a session on Big Tech and the future of finance. China is in the final steps of launching its own digital coin and Libra, Facebook\u2019s digital offering, is losing key backers and facing scrutiny from regulators worldwide, including the Bank of Canada.\n\n\u201cWe need to innovate to stay in the game,\u201d the presentation reads. A digital currency would provide \u201call the benefits\u201d of a central bank-backed asset, it says, as well as \u201call the convenience and security of wireless, electronic payments.\u201d\n\nIt lists over a dozen benefits to the bank launching its own digital currency, and only one downside.\n\n\u201cAn additional payment method could make the payment system more robust.\u201d But, the presentation notes, digital currency \u201calso presents a risk to stable, low-cost funding for (banks) (deposits).\u201d\n\nIt suggests a digital currency could come with the option to pay interest on balances, and the ability to collect more information on Canadians than is possible when people use cash. \u201cPersonal details not shared with payee, but could be shared with police or tax authorities,\u201d reads the presentation.\n\nWe need to innovate to stay in the game Bank of Canada presentation\n\nMurchison, who is on secondment at the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec, directed questions to the Bank of Canada, which declined an interview request. In an email to The Logic, spokesperson Louise Egan said the bank has not yet decided whether it will launch a digital currency, and that the question of sharing information with police and tax authorities is \u201camong the many issues that continue to be assessed by Bank researchers.\u201d\n\nEgan also said the bank is aware of more potential downsides to issuing its own digital currency than the one listed in the report, including a reputational risk for the bank if it issues an e-money that is not widely used, or is used, but for illegal activity.\n\nShe did not directly answer questions about whether a digital currency issued by the Bank of Canada would include the specific details included in the presentation.\n\nAsked if the project had concluded and if the bank would be issuing a currency, Egan said its \u201cresearch on this topic is ongoing.\u201d Scott Hendry, the bank\u2019s senior director for financial technology, now oversees the bank\u2019s digital currency research.\n\nThe presentation suggests two deployment options for a digital currency: token-based and account-based. It warns that banknotes are becoming obsolete as a means of payment, creating problems for the banking system as a whole: \u201cThe time may come that merchants/banks find it too costly to accept banknotes.\u201d\n\nIf that happens, \u201cordinary Canadians would lose access to central bank money,\u201d but the bank\u2019s ability to carry out monetary policy and act as a lender of last resort would not be affected, it states. However, those functions could be threatened by the rise of cryptocurrencies, according to the presentation.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrencies may become a direct threat to our ability to implement monetary policy and lender of last resort (LOLR) role.\u201d\n\nCryptocurrency use is growing. A July 2018 study from the bank found five per cent of Canadians owned Bitcoin, up from 2.9 per cent the year previous.\n\nThe Bank of Canada has been studying digital currencies since at least 2013, when its two-year plan said it would \u201cexplore the frontiers of e-money \u2014 digital alternatives to cash and their implications for central banks.\u201d More recently, however, the issue has taken on new urgency: in October 2018, a Financial Stability Board working group, chaired by Murchison, released a report on how cryptocurrencies could destabilize the global financial system and what steps central banks should take to avoid it. Since the report\u2019s release, Facebook has announced plans for Libra, and China is poised to launch its own coin.\n\nThe time may come that merchants/banks find it too costly to accept banknotes Bank of Canada presentation\n\nInternational cooperation is cited as a key issue in the presentation: \u201cThe incentive to produce a ubiquitous international currency is huge.\u201d The Bank of Canada is already taking steps to work with other central banks on digital currencies. In May, it announced it had conducted the world\u2019s first transfer of a digital currency from one central bank to another, in partnership with Singapore.\n\nCanada is far from the only country exploring a digital currency. Last week, Switzerland\u2019s central bank started exploring the use of digital currencies for trading. Sweden and Singapore both have research efforts underway. China appears ready to be the first to launch, with plans to have its own currency up and running either late this year or early next.\n\nIt\u2019s not just countries getting into the digital currency game. In addition to Facebook\u2019s Libra, JPMorgan is already using a digital coin and Vanguard is testing a blockchain-based currency trading system.\n\nThe Bank of Canada, by contrast, has been relatively quiet about digital currencies in recent months. In April, deputy governor Timothy Lane spoke at an International Monetary Fund event on the topic. In July, the bank told The Logic it would monitor Libra for potential risks to the financial system, but did not specify any particular concerns.\n\nThe Logic", "description": "An internal Bank of Canada presentation says benefits of a digital currency include the sharing of personal information with police or tax authorities", "authors": ["Zane Schwartz"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bank-of-canada.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
