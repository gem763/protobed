Now we know the first technical details of the product, courtesy of a tweet from OnePlus India: it uses a 55-inch QLED panel.\n\nPrevious filings have suggested Android-based models of between 43 and 75 inches in size, with the 43-inch variant seemingly also bound for India. This announcement doesn\u2019t necessarily rule any of that out, but it does at least confirm that India is getting a 55-inch version. The 75-inch model is likely to come to the US and China.\n\nQLED is Samsung\u2019s marketing term for quantum-dot LED screen technology \u2014 it\u2019s nothing like OLED, despite the similar name. QLED panels still rely on LED backlighting, unlike OLED where each individual pixel emits its own light, so the image quality of a QLED TV is largely dependent on how effective the backlighting solution is. For example, the number of local dimming zones is critical for HDR performance.\n\nIn other words, we still can\u2019t say much about the OnePlus TV until we see it for ourselves. But that\u2019s the case with any TV, really, and that time won\u2019t be so far off.", "description": "But that might not be the only model", "authors": ["Sam Byford", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/05xqH7-UKwC0DE44JD9UyJW64kY=/0x2:1024x538/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19098462/ECk5ASoUEAAMC8d.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-08-23"}
