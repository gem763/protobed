But experts giving evidence to MPs on the environment, food and rural affairs committee said the infrastructure required to deal with the new packaging was not in place and there was a lack of consumer understanding about these alternatives.\n\nMuch of the compostable packaging produced for the UK market only degrades in industrial composting facilities, rather than in home composting \u2013 but not all is sent to these facilities.\n\nSeven tonnes of marine plastic pollution collected on remote Arnhem Land beach Read more\n\nEnvironmental NGOs told the committee that the rapid introduction of such alternatives could actually increase plastic pollution.\n\nJuliet Phillips, of the Environmental Investigation Agency, said: \u201cIf a biodegradable cup gets into the sea, it could pose just as much of a problem to marine life as a conventional plastic cup.\u201d\n\nGreen Alliance \u2013 a coalition of NGOs \u2013 said there was evidence that the term biodegradable made consumers think it was fine to discard it into the environment, which would make pollution on land and at sea even worse.\n\nNeil Parish, chair of the Commons select committee, said: \u201cIn the backlash against plastic, other materials are being increasingly used as substitutes in food and drink packaging.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that such actions are being taken without proper consideration of wider environmental consequences, such as higher carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cCompostable plastics have been introduced without the right infrastructure or consumer understanding to manage compostable waste.\u201d\n\nKeep Britain Tidy said \u201cthe drive to introduce bioplastics, biodegradable plastics and compostable plastics is being done with limited emphasis on explaining the purpose of these materials to the public or consideration of whether they are in fact better from an environmental perspective than the plastic packaging they replace\u201d.\n\nThe committee, in a report on plastic food and drink packaging published on Thursday, said the government should focus on reducing the use of plastic packaging rather than replacing it with other materials.\n\n\u201cReduction is far more important than recycling, and a fundamental shift away from all single-use packaging, plastic or otherwise, is now necessary,\u201d the report said.\n\nA government consultation on biodegradable and compostable packaging is under way. It will examine whether the standard required for all such alternative plastics should be that they can be home composted.\n\nIn evidence to the committee Libby Peake, from Green Alliance, said there was a need for standards to be re-examined, saying: \u201cSome companies are already switching to alternatives including bio-based and compostable plastics, paper, cartons or other materials in ways that will not ultimately prove sustainable.\u201d\n\nPeake added: \u201cYou cannot have a wholesale switchover to bio-based plastics, to aluminium, to glass or to paper, which all have environmental consequences themselves.\u201d\n\nVegware, a compostable packaging manufacturer, said it advised consumers to put their products in the general waste if suitable composting was not possible.\n\nThe committee said it was shocking that the government had no idea how much plastic packaging was put on to the market. This is because the system is based on producers self-declaring their packaging footprint, and only those with a turnover of more than \u00a32m and 50 tonnes of packaging a year are obliged to release their data. MPs recommended this figure should be reduced to 1 tonne.\n\nPhillips from the EIA welcomed the report. She said: \u201cTo date, far too little Government attention has been given to addressing the root causes of the pollution crisis by challenging our unsustainable single-use society. EIA urges the government to take note of its findings, introducing a long-term strategy to catalyse a wholesale transition away from wasteful, unnecessary single-use packaging and towards reusable and refillable solutions.\u201d\n\nDisposable, single-use plastics used for packaging food and drink \u2013 particularly cigarette butts, plastic drinking bottles, plastic caps, food wrappers, grocery bags, plastic lids, straws and stirrers \u2013 are the most common single use plastics found in the environment, according to a 2018 UN report.", "description": "Committee says UK should reduce use of plastics rather than replace it with other materials", "authors": ["Sandra Laville"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a0548bdceab9c5ada6694cca35b692cce9cf4cc/0_316_4724_2834/master/4724.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=08837f00c5b896752c301db714459090", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
