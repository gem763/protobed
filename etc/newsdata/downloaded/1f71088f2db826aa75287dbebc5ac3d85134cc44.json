In practice, this has been understood to mean becoming primarily dependent on cash assistance, income maintenance or government support for long-term institutionalisation.\n\nThe Trump administration's rule would take that further - considering past and current use of a wide range of assistance like Medicaid, food stamps, and housing vouchers that are not currently considered, as well as taking into account factors like the immigrant's age, employment status and English-language abilities to determine whether they could potentially become public burdens at any point in the future and denying them residency if officials decide the answer is \"yes\".\n\nThose changes have outraged immigrants and their advocates, who say there has already been a chilling effect from immigrants who are now scared to ask for help for which they are eligible, for themselves or their relatives - including citizen children, out of fear of what it could mean.\n\nThey have also said the rule changes are discriminatory and would have the effect of barring immigrants with lower incomes in favour of those with wealth. The government has said the rule changes would ensure that those gaining residency status are self-sufficient.\n\nThe scheduled enactment next week of the rule comes as the Trump administration on Friday announced another rule, a proclamation effective November 3 that bars immigrants from coming to the US unless they will be covered by health insurance within 30 days of entering or have the financial wherewithal to pay for any medical costs.\n\nIn a packed Manhattan courtroom on Monday, US District Judge George Daniels extensively questioned the government's lawyer, Ethan Davis of the Department of Justice, over the rationale behind the administration's changing of the rule and the adding of factors that would be considered in determining whether someone could become a public charge.\n\n\"You've got to give me some rational basis,\" he said.\n\nRoughly 544,000 people apply for green cards annually. According to the government, 382,000 are in categories that would make them subject to the new review, according to the government.\n\nImmigrants make up a small portion of those getting public benefits, since many are ineligible to get them due to their immigration status.\n\nFor Medicaid, non-citizen immigrants are only 6.5 percent of participants, while more than 87 percent are native-born. For food assistance, immigrants are 8.8 percent of recipients, with over 85 percent of participants being native-born.", "description": "The new policy aims to deny legal permanent residency to many immigrants over the use of public benefits.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/8/8/a6a586b9cebe41a8b95a6f98bb8d7fdb_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
