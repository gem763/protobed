Baa! Maa!\u201d a few hundred people shout in unison over the tunes of a onesie-clad DJ, as our host prompts the chants from onstage inside an events venue dressed up with rows of exhibitor booths and a pastoral photo opp with cutout cows.\n\nThe enthusiastic call and response feels like spring break-meets-motivational rally, but instead of worshipping at the altar of wet T-shirts or self-empowerment, we are here to celebrate an edible miracle of microbiology: cheese \u2014 and the people who sell it.\n\nFounded a decade ago by third-generation cheese importer Adam Moskowitz, the Cheesemonger Invitational is a bi-annual summit held in New York and San Francisco. Over the course of a weekend, dozens of mongers meet international producers, attend seminars, and advance their culinary educations. Then, they get down to business with the main event: a 10-part Olympic Decathlon of cheese selling that tests knowledge, palate, and mongering mojo.\n\n\u201cAre there cheese rivalries?\u201d I ask a representative from Vermont Creamery, stationed next to the Wisconsin booth in what I assume is a calculated effort to stoke the flames of a long-simmering rivalry.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she answers perkily. \u201cIt\u2019s like one big cheese family.\u201d\n\nWisconsin\u2019s within earshot. I decide she must be lying.\n\nPhoto: Ellen Mary Cronin\n\nFor the non-competing public, CMI is an all-you-can-eat cheese rave buffet. Tables from host creameries and sponsors fill the venue floor, offerings slices of Bellavitano soaked in raspberry ale, bright orange cheddar streaked through with blue, pricey jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico sliced straight from the leg, and swag with cute sayings like, \u201cCheese is my jam.\u201d\n\nA rep in a monogrammed puffy jacket explains how the acclaimed Gruy\u00e8re 1655 AOP is made using glacial waters and alpine salt. A monger from Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy in the U.K. takes us through a progression of Kirkham\u2019s Lancashire, the only traditional farmhouse Lancashire in the world. He hands over a sample of Montgomery\u2019s Cheddar, a celebrity cheese that tastes like horseradish and fresh grass; nothing like the distant cousin I picked up at Safeway last week.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing snobby about the vibe, but these are serious cheese people. They sport T-shirts with the words \u201cBeneficial Microbe.\u201d They greet familiar cheeses like old friends. They make jokes about sanitised work stations and, yes, inevitably cutting the cheese. I like cheese, but compared to this crowd I might as well be lactose intolerant.\n\nFor a brief moment sometime into my second hour of stabbing toothpicks into tiny chunks and nodding sagely, I reach full cheese capacity. This is too much cheese, I think. Then I smack myself, grab a cracker and keep eating.\n\nThe competition, however, is no picnic.\n\nCheesemongers are the sherpas of the cheese world, benevolent guides who must cultivate an encyclopedic knowledge of the wedges and wheels on their counters so they can help customers pick just the right goat gouda or funky washed rind.\n\nLike dating, says monger Derek Glazzard from Oliver\u2019s Market in Windsor, California, \u201ca lot of people just haven\u2019t met the right goat yet, they haven\u2019t met the right blue.\u201d\n\nIf you want to expand your cultured horizons, befriend your local cheesemonger. And quit being a weenie.\n\nTo make cheesemongering a competitive sport, CMI breaks the work of a monger down into its basic elements, testing each over the course of 10 different events. There\u2019s a written exam on the science of turning milk into Morbier or Mimolette, a cutting test to slice a perfect quarter pound, two separate wrapping rounds, and a mock salesmanship scenario.\n\nThree weeks before they arrive, each monger is also assigned a trio of cheeses with which they must create a perfect pairing, a perfect slate, and a perfect composed bite. Finally, they must identify an array of aromas and complete a blind tasting, naming each cheese, its milk, and whether it\u2019s raw or pasteurised.\n\nIf you can identify a cheese\u2019s particular aromas and flavour notes \u2014 calling out Sbrinz\u2019s brown-buttered popcorn rather than general nuttiness, says Matt DeLoach, a competitor from Harmons Neighbourhood Grocer in Utah \u2014 you can guide an open-minded eater towards a new discovery.\n\nThat interaction, says Cowgirl Creamery sous chef and CMI rookie Jill Zenoff, is what mongering is all about. \u201cI get really super excited that they\u2019re super excited. I love that part of our job.\u201d\n\nJill Zenoff, the 2019 Cheesemonger Invitational champion.

Eyeballing a perfect quarter-pound is excruciatingly tough, and the crowd\u2019s emotions rise and fall as each chunk hits the scale: .20, .18, .30. At .24, there\u2019s a collective groan. When the scale reads a perfect .25 the audience explodes in cheers, myself included. Slicing cheese makes a shockingly good spectator sport. Nobody scores more than one.\n\nWhen the judges have tallied the cumulative scores, the room gets quiet for the first time all night, and it\u2019s time to announce the winner: The 2019 Cheesemonger Invitational Champion is Jill Zenoff, the CMI rookie from Cowgirl Creamery.\n\nAs her jaw drops, someone places a golden tiara atop her pigtails and drapes a cow print scarf over her shoulders. They try to hand her a trophy, but Zenoff isn\u2019t paying attention. She\u2019s ecstatic and gobsmacked, hugging everyone and reaching for the guitar she brought for just this occasion, so she can serenade the crowd with an ode to cheese that came \u201cpouring out of [her] one night\u201d to the tune of the Indigo Girls\u2019 \u201cGalileo.\u201d\n\nHow long will the cheese last tonight? Can any human being tell me if I should eat this rind? I\u2019ll call on the resting soul of Daphne Zepos Queen of affinage, queen of cheese mites\n\nSoon lighters are in the air, and I\u2019ve joined the hundreds of curd nerds hopped up on Comte and Caveman Blue singing along as Zenoff strums. There are no rivalries at cheese camp, and tonight we\u2019re all cheese people.", "description": "It\u2019s 6 p.m. on a Sunday night in San Francisco, and I\u2019m surrounded by people screaming animal noises....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/iglspec7lunxf5hg3tf4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
