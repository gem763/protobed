When he saw me he changed colors and disappeared.'", "description": "Footage of the colour-changing octopus was captured by a free-diver as he swam in the crystal clear waters in the French Riviera.", "authors": ["Sophie Law For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/18/16/8701982-0-image-a-78_1547830180703.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-18"}
