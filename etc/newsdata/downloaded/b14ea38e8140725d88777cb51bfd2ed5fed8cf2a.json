So, if you think your Friday was bad, at least you aren\u2019t this poor guy.\n\nThe Sydney-sider was at work in Mosman when his pants and the contents of his pants were caught in the machine, the Daily Mail reports.\n\nUnsurprisingly, a NSW Ambulance spokesperson confirmed the man suffered tears to his genital area, with the man and the machine both being taken to a nearby hospital for a careful removal process.\n\nThe tradie was treated at Royal North Shore Hospital where he remained in a stable condition, despite his assumably painful injuries.\n\nTwo ambulances, as well as fire and rescue crews were called to the Orlando Avenue worksite in Mosman on Friday after the incident occurred.\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly what he was doing with the belt sander when the incident occurred, but one would assume nobody would voluntarily put their junk in a belt sander, so it was likely an unfortunate accident. Here\u2019s hoping the young tradie makes a full recovery and this is nothing more than a story he can bring up at knock off drinks in a few years.\n\nThe incident is currently under investigation by SafeWork NSW. Thankfully, the tradie has since been discharged from Royal North Shore Hospital and is recovering at home.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/belt-sander.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
