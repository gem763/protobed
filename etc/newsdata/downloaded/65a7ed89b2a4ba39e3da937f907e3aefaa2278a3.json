Rents are coming down by a third but business rates are still sky high. If a sensible solution to Brexit can be found, everyone can stop panicking. But at the moment Christmas is impossible to call.\n\n\u2018The rates system is broken. The high street is in continual decline. But this tax is based on 2015 property values, when the world was very different. When is the Government going to wake up?\u2019\n\nDepartment store John Lewis offered a massive 20 per cent discount on home products at the end of last month \u2013 a two-week event which one retail veteran described as \u2018unprecedented\u2019 and \u2018basically a fire sale\u2019 \u2013 following poor first-half results.\n\nSales of its home goods have soared but the discounting is thought likely to damage festive profit margins.\n\nMarks & Spencer has been cutting furniture prices by up to 30 per cent. Debenhams and House of Fraser were this weekend both offering up to 50 per cent off.", "description": "High street retailers are braced for their worst Christmas in more than a decade as they struggle with high taxes, economic fears and frenzied discounting only weeks into the season.", "authors": ["Neil Craven For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
