USA TODAY\n\n'Thank you for the final time'\n\nGeorge Collins, 58, said he took the train from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., on Thursday morning to say thank you to Rep. Elijah Cummings one last time.\n\nCummings, who died Oct. 17, was lying in state inside the U.S. Capitol on Thursday.\n\nCollins, a life-long Baltimore resident, would visit the congressman's office often. He said he last visited two weeks ago regarding legislation Cummings signed on to co-sponsor that would help firefighters. Collins is a retired firefighter.\n\n\"I'm here for the last time to visit him at the office to say thank you for the final time,\" Collins said, adding that Cummings, who represented parts of Baltimore, was always \"accessible, accountable and responsible.\"\n\n\"We're going to have a big hole in Baltimore, not only from politics and being a representative, but an individual who was a moral compass,\" Collins added.\n\n'He has such big shoes to fill'\n\nNancy Chavannes-Battle of Prince George's County, Maryland, said that she stood in line for nearly an hour and a half to say her last goodbyes to Cummings. The 52-year-old said that she \"had to make it a point to come down.\"\n\n\"He's done so much for us, so much for the state, so much for the country and it was really touching,\" she said, adding that she whispered a short prayer for the congressman to rest in piece.\n\nWendy Bourque, of Howard County, Maryland, said she was a constituent of Cummings' and that she cried when she heard he died because she hadn't known he was in poor health.\n\n\"I felt like he really represented us well,\" she said of Cummings. \"I hope that the future person that comes into his position does as well as or if not a better job than he did, which is probably going to be impossible.\n\n\"He has such big shoes to fill.\"\n\n'He fought for all people'\n\nAnthony Jaby, 64, said he wanted to come pay his respects and honor the late congressman. Jaby, who is from Washington, D.C., and an Air Force veteran, said that Cummings stood \"up against anybody for the truth and to help people.\"\n\n\"He didn't just fight for black people, he fought for all people,\" Jaby said of Cummings, who was outspoken on civil rights.\n\n'Enough is enough': The moments that defined the career of Rep. Elijah Cummings\n\n'He is a legend'\n\nDenise Harper, who is also from D.C., said that one of her biggest regrets is that she never got to meet Cummings.\n\nShe said that after seeing him on TV and listening to his remarks, she felt like she knew him.\n\n\"He is a legend, he was a humble man,\" she said, \"more politicians on both sides of the aisle should take a cue from him.\n\n\"He knew how to bring people together, he never forgot who he was in Congress for, who he was there to serve,\" she continued. \"He remained true to his roots.\"\n\nElijah Cummings' funeral: Barack Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton to attend Elijah Cummings' Baltimore funeral\n\n'Take a page from his playbook'\n\nPat Brew of King George, Va., said that she appreciates all the congressman did in regards to civil rights.\n\n\"We were in a very different place, 30, 40 years ago,\" Brew said. \"He remembers that place and he did all that he could to make sure that we didn't regress as a nation back to that place. I hope that the young representatives and senators and everyone would take a page from his playbook and to continue to do the same and fight for civil rights.\"\n\nThe closing ceremony before public viewing\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., stood in front of Cummings\u2019 casket as the Senate wreath was presented. Both men then went and each shook hands with the Maryland Democrat's widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings. Each gave her a hug before returning to their seats.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., then stood in front of Cummings\u2019 casket as the House wreath was presented. They also embraced Rockeymoore.\n\nAfter the service was done, Rockeymoore walked up to Cummings\u2019 casket and prayed with her hands in the air. She then walked away, holding back tears.\n\n'Everybody's crushed': Baltimore mourns the death of Rep. Elijah Cummings\n\nHoyer: Cummings' mission was to stop abuse of public trust\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said Cummings saw his work in Congress as a \"trust from providence\" and that it was his mission to \"ensure that everyone who serves in public office is held to account for the abuse of that trust.\"\n\n\"The public trust for him was a sacred thing. Like the biblical prophet Elijah, he saw wrongdoing and spent his life working to banish it from our land,\" he said.\n\nHoyer was one of the first speakers to go hug Rockeymoore after his remarks.\n\nClyburn: 'A passion for justice'\n\nTo honor Cummings, Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., quoted from the biblical Book of Micah, which says, \"The Lord requires us to do justly, act mercifully and walk humbly.\"\n\n\"Elijah E. Cummings personified this directive in his service and in the core of his living,\" Clyburn said. \"Elijah had a passion for justice: justice for those who are underserved; justice for those who are undercut; and justice for those who are underestimated.\"\n\nBass: Cummings was seen as a 'quiet giant'\n\n\"The Congressional Black Caucus is a close-knit family. Thursday, Oct. 17, the CBC lost a member of our family,\" said Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., the CBC chairwoman.\n\n\"Elijah Cummings was respected, revered and viewed as a quiet giant within the caucus,\" Bass said. \"We watched him lead the Oversight and Reform Committee. We watched his heartfelt passion as he fought for the rights of children separated from their families, as he fought for everyone to have health care and medications that are affordable, and as he fought for everyone to have the right, and access to vote.\"\n\nMeadows discusses 'unexpected friendship' with Cummings\n\nRep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., passionately talked about his friendship with Cummings, his eyes glistening as he held back tears.\n\nHe said he was \"privileged enough\" to be able to call Cummings \"a dear friend.\"\n\n\"Some had classified it as an unexpected friendship,\" Meadows said of their bipartisan relationship in a highly partisan era. \"But for those of that know Elijah, it\u2019s not unexpected.\"\n\nMeadows said \"perhaps this place and this country would be better served with a few more unexpected friendships. I know I\u2019ve been blessed by one.\"\n\nPhotos: Maryland congressman Elijah Cummings dies at 68\n\nSchumer: A 'kind, caring and honorable man'\n\nSchumer said Cummings \u201cwas strong, very strong, when necessary.\u201d\n\nBut he was \u201calso kind, and caring, and honorable,\u201d Schumer, the Senate minority leader, added. \u201cUniversally respected and admired, in a divided time. His voice could shake mountains, stir the most cynical hearts, inspiring us all to be better.\"\n\n\"A sharecropper\u2019s son, born and raised in Baltimore, Elijah Cummings never forgot where he came from and never lost sight of where he wanted his country to go,\" he said.\n\nMcConnell: Cummings 'truly has gone home'\n\n\"Elijah Cummings did not just represent Baltimore, he embodied it,\u201d said McConnell, the Senate majority leader.\n\nMcConnell said Cummings\u2019 commitment to Baltimore \u2013 much of which lies in his congressional district \u2013 was clearly on display in 2015 during the riots that followed the death of a black man in police custody.\n\n\u201cBy day, the congressman was here in the Capitol, working and leading in these hallways of power. But every night, he rode the train back home and walked the neighborhoods, bullhorn in hand, encouraging unity and peace,\" McConnell recalled.\n\n\"Here's what he said: 'Let's go home. Let's all go home,'\" he said. \"Now, our distinguished colleague truly has gone home.\"\n\nPelosi calls Cummings 'master of the House'\n\n\"Elijah Cummings: son of sharecroppers, master of the House,\" said Pelosi, a Baltimore native, referencing Cummings' rise from humble beginnings to the halls of Congress. \"It is my official, and personal, and sad honor to welcome Chairman Elijah and all who loved him to this celebration of his life.\"\n\nPelosi spoke of Cummings' commitment to, and love for, the House of Representatives in which he served. She cited his desire to mentor freshman lawmakers because, he told her, \"I love their potential and I want to help them realize it.\"\n\nShe said Cummings understood that members of Congress would \"have to face the judgment of history and that we are part of a long and honorable heritage of our democracy.\"\n\nOriginal story:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Rep. Elijah Cummings laid in state on Thursday within the U.S. Capitol where he served for 23 years as a congressman, becoming one of the few African-Americans to be so honored.\n\nCurrent and former members of Congress assembled before Cummings' flag-draped coffin was brought into the National Statuary Hall \u2013 a large, domed room that once served as the House chamber \u2013 followed by his widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, the chairwoman of the Maryland Democratic Party. Other family members dressed in gray and black entered next, some staring straight ahead and others clutching each other's arms.\n\nCummings, a Democrat whose district included large sections of Baltimore, died last week at age 68 from complications related to longstanding health issues.\n\nA day after his death, Pelosi announced that Cummings would lie in state in Statuary Hall.\n\nAn hour ahead of the service, guests began slowly coming in, such as journalists April Ryan, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. Baltimore Mayor Bernard Young, wearing a dark blue suit, was also among the first few to arrive.\n\nMembers of the House then entered, followed by senators. Several 2020 presidential candidates were among them. And joining the lawmakers was former House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc.\n\nA low buzz of whispers and chatting filled Statuary Hall ahead of the memorial service. But as Pelosi led in both parties\u2019 leadership and designated speakers, the room fell quiet. Small huddles among different lawmakers began to form, as they waited for Cummings\u2019 casket to come into the hall. At one point, Pelosi and Schumer walked away from their colleagues for a quick chat.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Black Caucus entered Statuary Hall Thursday in single file and wearing kente cloth scarves as they prepared to honor Cummings, a former caucus chairman who was outspoken on issues of civil rights and voter access.\n\nRep. Karen Bass, D-Calif, led the processions followed by civil rights legend Rep. John Lewis.\n\nA solemn silence fell over the hall as Cummings\u2019 casket was brought in around 11:15 a.m. EDT.\n\nElijah Cummings' Baltimore: 'Everybody's crushed': Baltimore mourns the death of Rep. Elijah Cummings\n\nCummings was the first black lawmaker to lie in state in the Capitol, according to the CBC. Two African-Americans who were not elected officials have lain in honor in the Capitol rotunda \u2013 civil rights icon Rosa Parks and Capitol Police Officer Jacob Chestnut\n\nLying in state in the Capitol is a rare honor reserved for the nation's \"most eminent citizens,\" according to the Architect of the Capitol. Just 31 people have been granted that honor, including 12 former presidents.\n\nLast year, preacher Billy Graham was laid in honor, and former President George H.W. Bush and Sen. John McCain were laid in state. Those three were the first to be so honored since Sen. Daniel Inouye in 2012.\n\nNormally, the remains are placed in the Capitol rotunda, which the Architect of the Capitol says \"has been considered the most suitable place for the nation to pay final tribute,\" and members of the public wait in long lines that extend outside the Capitol to pay their respects.\n\nIt is unclear if National Statuary Hall has been used previously for those lying in state within the Capitol. Statuary Hall is located just south of the rotunda, and it is also a large space with a domed roof. The room served as the chamber where the House of Representatives gathered from 1819 to 1857. It contains 35 of the 100 statues submitted by the states for display in the Capitol.\n\nThe casket of Rep. Elijah Cummings is carried by honor guard up the Capitol Hill steps where he will lie in state at a ceremony in Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY)\n\nCummings' funeral will be held Friday at the New Psalmist Baptist Church in Baltimore, where he worshipped for nearly 40 years.\n\nOn Wednesday, mourners paid respects to Cummings as his body lay in repose at Morgan State University, a historically black college in Cummings' district. Cummings served on the school's Board of Regents for 19 years.\n\nEnough is enough': The moments that defined the career of Rep. Elijah Cummings\n\nBefore his death, the House Oversight and Reform Committee chairman had been leading several investigations into President Donald Trump and his administration.\n\nCummings drew Trump's ire as his committee prepared to subpoena the communications of the president's daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. He also sparred with Trump after Cummings sharply criticized the administration's handling of detained migrants. In response, Trump called the congressman a \"brutal bully\" and denounced Baltimore as a \"rodent-infested mess\" where \"no human being would want to live.\"\n\nAt a National Press Club luncheon in August, Cummings said he wished Trump would visit Baltimore and denounced the president's use of inflammatory rhetoric.\n\n\"Those in the highest levels of government must stop invoking fear, using racist language and encouraging reprehensible behavior,\" he said. \"It only creates more division among us and severely limits our ability to work together for the common good. As a country, we finally must say that enough is enough.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press and Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nMore: How Elijah Cummings' unexpected death could affect the impeachment inquiry\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/24/elijah-cummings-death-baltimore-lawmaker-lie-state-capitol/4069903002/", "description": "Cummings, a Democrat whose district included\u00a0sections of Baltimore, died last week\u00a0at age 68 from complications related to longstanding health issues.", "authors": ["William Cummings", "Rebecca Morin", "Published A.M.
