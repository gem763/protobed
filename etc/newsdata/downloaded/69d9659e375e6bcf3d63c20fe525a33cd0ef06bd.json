We retract that statement, and I assure you that the Houston Astros will learn from this experience.\u201d\n\nAstros owner Jim Crane sent me a letter on Saturday retracting the team\u2019s original statement about my story. \u201cWe were wrong.\u201dhttps://t.co/arvGceF4To pic.twitter.com/bw2TZI3fh2 \u2014 Stephanie Apstein (@stephapstein) October 27, 2019\n\nApstein wrote a column for Sports Illustrated following the Astros\u2018 victory in the American League Championship Series, saying assistant GM Brandon Taubman shouted vulgarities at her and other female reporters in support of Astros closer and alleged domestic abuser Roberto Osuna.\n\nThe Astros declined to comment for Apstein\u2019s story, but after it was published, they released a statement saying Apstein\u2019s reporting was \u201cmisleading and completely irresponsible\u201d and added, \u201cWe are extremely disappointed in Sports Illustrated\u2019s attempt to fabricate a story where one does not exist.\u201d\n\nIf Apstein had indeed made up the story, she could have been fired and her reputation as a reporter would have been tarnished. But the day after the Astros\u2018 PR team released that statement, they followed it up with a new one in which Taubman halfway admitted to his behavior.\n\nTaubman has since been fired following an MLB investigation.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
