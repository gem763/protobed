They insist that the gun is evil or there are not enough regulations to stop a criminal so \"we must do something\" \u2013 ignoring that the very spirit of a criminal is they break laws.\n\nI recently read an article from the far-left online publication Salon. The writer's main gripe was the National Rifle Association\u2019s saying, \"the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\" Lucian K. Truscott IV, the author, attempted to make the case that there are too many guns and used several examples in an attempt to prove his point. In actuality, he confirmed the belief that law-abiding citizens need to carry more often than not.\n\nLet's start with the obvious: a tyrannical government. Our Founding Fathers had first-hand knowledge of tyranny. They rebelled against the Crown of England because of the form of slavery that comes with big government. Once our founders obtained freedom, they knew it was essential to own firearms as a method in keeping the newly found small federal government from growing and putting its thumb on them.\n\nTruscott complained a lot but never offered any new solutions. The left is notorious for this, especially when the topic is gun control. They often blame the NRA or Republicans for blocking something that \"could have been done to prevent\" a tragedy but they only wish to add more laws, seek additional restrictions, or ban individual styles of weapons. These are not solutions. They are tyranny.\n\nThe lack of personal responsibility and the absence of leftists teaching this value is a problem. The left will not and refuses to admit that people are responsible for their actions. We see this in the gun control debate. In nearly all cases of rhetoric after a mass shooting, the left will not blame the shooter. It is always the gun's fault. Blame is not cast on the one who decided to murder and injure multiple people. The gun is an inanimate object, not a person who should answer for their choices.\n\nTruscott's fear-mongering article makes my point. In the last full paragraph, he tries to paint a scene of chaos during the El Paso, Odessa and Dayton shootings by suggesting how chaotic it was as people were being shot and \"guns were going off.\" See that? \"Guns were going off.\" It is the guns fault, and the more \"aggressive\" the guns look, such as AR-15s or AK-47s, then the higher chance of it going out and shooting people on its own.\n\nTruscott referenced an article from the Washington Post where a report from the Small Arms Survey found there are approximately 120.5 firearms for every 100 citizens. He called the number of guns owned by Americans \"an outrage\" and \"a profanity\" then called it a sign that America has \"lost its collective mind.\"\n\nHear that? Responsible, law-abiding gun owners have lost their minds because they choose to exercise their Second Amendment rights afforded to them, and according to Truscott, the government should take them away.\n\nTruscott's bemoaning is not truly about the NRA's \"good guy with a gun\" saying. It is not about Americans owning more than one gun. His whining is about the fact there are guns in America at all.\n\nGuns are in the way of leftists. They hate the Founding Fathers for placing it in the Constitution. One reason for the attacks on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was about getting one more seat so that the Second Amendment would be closer to being repealed. The left is desperate for radical activists as Supreme Court justices. Like former President Barack Obama said, they want to \"fundamentally change America.\"\n\nThe fact is that criminals will get guns, and they will use them. The idea that the government can protect you from the criminals who target a lone female in a parking lot, or an occupied home in a burglary, or unsuspecting individual in a parking lot late at night is idiotic. The government cannot make enough laws to protect individuals and the police are not always nearby.\n\nGood guys with guns are needed more than leftists who hate our Second Amendment.\n\nJohn Dempsey is a graduate of American Military University and has a deep understanding of law enforcement issues and how they relate to the Constitution, society and our culture.
