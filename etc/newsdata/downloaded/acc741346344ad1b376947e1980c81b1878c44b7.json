The sale still has to be approved by the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice, but the companies said they expect the deal to be closed within six to nine months.\n\nThe news comes a month after Elliott revealed a $3.2 billion stake in the telecommunications provider and said the company's shares have underperformed over a prolonged period of time. The fund suggested that AT&T could improve its business by selling non-core assets.\n\n\"These include the well-known examples of its home security business, regional sports networks, CME, Sky Mexico, Latin American pay TV business (Vrio), Puerto Rican operations and many, many more,\" the fund said in the letter.\n\nThe activist investor also said AT&T's purchases of DirecTV and Time Warner have been damaging to its overall business.\n\nIncluding the sale announced on Wednesday, AT&T has generated $11 billion from asset sales so far this year, the company said.\n\nShares of AT&T are up almost 30% year-to-date.\n\nRead more: Dyslexic, failing at school, and partially blind: How Larry Hite overcame the odds to become one of the most successful self-made stock traders using a strategy that's 'accessible to anybody'\n\nMarkets Insider", "description": "AT&T announced on Wednesday it plans to sell its Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands business to Liberty Latin America for almost $2 billion.\u00a0 The ...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d7fa8242e22af19fd41f345-2400/rtr2k7h9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
