The parents, after a brief period of rest, are therefore now taking their campaign to the USA and will visit New York City and Washington DC over the coming days, engaging with the media and politicians as they reach out for support from all Americans and to ask them to put pressure on the US administration to do the right thing.\n\n'They are looking forward to making as many new friends in the USA as possible.\n\n'Harry's family will simply not leave matters where they are and will do whatever it takes, including taking legal action if necessary, to secure Justice 4 Harry.'", "description": "Parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, have now decided to take their fight to the US, and have said they will visit both New York and Washington DC to gain support from Americans.", "authors": ["Amelia Wynne For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/15/19628474-0-image-a-64_1570891373490.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
