United could look to make a coaching change", "language": "en", "text": "But in the wake of an MLS playoff defeat at Toronto on Oct. 19 \u2014 United has not advanced past the first round since 2015 \u2014 Olsen recognizes the organization could look to make a coaching change this offseason.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s time, then it\u2019s time,\u201d he said. \u201cI have done my time here. I think I continue to do a good job for this club. . . . If the people in charge think it\u2019s time \u2014 they see me; they know what I am doing; I am an open book; they know how I coach \u2014 if they think the team needs to go in a different direction, they\u2019ll make that decision.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOlsen has two years remaining on his contract with a clause that would keep him with the club in another capacity if both sides so chose.\n\nUnited officials have not gone out of their way to declare Olsen will return, saying they have begun their evaluation of all aspects of the team.\n\nD.C. entered the year with high expectations following a 2018 resurgence inspired by English superstar Wayne Rooney but finished fifth in the Eastern Conference with a 13-10-11 record. In the playoffs, United scored a late equalizer before conceding four goals in extra time for a 5-1 defeat.\n\n\u201cThe ending game was disappointing; the season itself was not disappointing,\u201d said Olsen, 42, who sits behind only Kansas City\u2019s Peter Vermes for the longest current coaching tenure in MLS.\n\nAD\n\nUnited has not advanced to the conference final since 2012.\n\nAD\n\nAddressing Olsen\u2019s status last week, Jason Levien, United\u2019s chief executive, told The Washington Post that \u201cone of the assets we have is the continuity in our staff. We\u2019ve got a lot of faith in that leadership, and it sends a message to everyone in the organization when we stand by our leadership.\"\n\nHowever, he added: \u201cThe results haven\u2019t been there. We have to evaluate this stuff.\u201d\n\nThe evaluation will also involve the roster. United was second best in MLS defensively but, aside from a few matches scattered throughout the 34-game campaign, never replicated the attacking prowess and finished 21st of 24 teams in scoring.\n\nAD\n\nThe partnership between Rooney and Luciano Acosta fizzled. Amid plans to return to England after this season, Rooney scored once after July 1. Acosta was a bust, and by August, had lost his starting job.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe season isn\u2019t all on Lucho,\u201d Olsen said of Acosta. \u201cIt\u2019s not all on Wayne. It\u2019s all of us.\u201d\n\nBoth are departing: Rooney to Derby County and Acosta, whose contract expires this winter, to parts unknown.\n\nReflecting on the Rooney-Acosta dynamic from one year to the next, Olsen said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if that run was sustainable. It was so epic, and the desperation and the home game after home game and the energy, to sustain that is a hard thing to do, especially when you rely on those two to make so many plays for you.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAcosta, a Best XI all-league selection last year, did not seem the same mentally since training camp, when a proposed move to Paris Saint-Germain fell through. During this season, multiple people close to the situation said, Acosta turned down a long-term offer from United that would have quadrupled his salary to more than $2 million. Since then, his value on the MLS and international market has dropped substantially. United will retain his rights.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI generally feel bad for Lucho that this year was so turbulent,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cIt started off with that crushing blow and it just seemed he was always dealing with the emotional side of his situation. That sometimes can take away from the soccer and the freedom, and being at his best.\u201d\n\nWith Acosta leaving, Olsen said United will prioritize the central midfield position this offseason. Paul Arriola, a winger, filled the void late in the year.\n\nAD\n\nOla Kamara, a late-season signing, is expected to take Rooney\u2019s slot at striker.\n\n\u201cIf we now get some difference-makers that can be consistently our best players,\u201d Olsen said, \u201cthen we have the surrounding pieces to be a very competitive team.\u201d\n\nRetaining the core would mean re-signing center back Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Brillant and retaining Bill Hamid, an MLS goalkeeper of the year finalist on loan from Danish club Midtjylland.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe want Bill back,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cI want Bill back.\u201d\n\nUnited will have to extend the loan or buy Hamid\u2019s contract.\n\n\u201cThis place means everything to me,\u201d said the Annandale native, who, aside from six months in 2018 in Denmark, has spent his entire 10-year pro career in Washington. \u201cI want to be here.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNotes: Jalen Robinson, a homegrown defender with 19 league starts in six seasons, said he will not return. His contract expired. \u2026\n\nUnited and backup goalkeeper Chris Seitz have struck a deal on a new contract, a person familiar with the talks said. \u2026\n\nDefender Marquinhos Pedroso (three starts) is not expected to return. The club has a few more weeks to decide whether to exercise contract options.\n\nMore soccer coverage from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cIf it\u2019s time, then it\u2019s time,\u201d Olsen said at an end-of-season session with reporters.", "authors": ["Steven Goff", "Reporter Covering Soccer", "D.C.
