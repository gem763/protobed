Some are already discussing legislation to push back.\n\n\u201cA precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran and the Assad regime,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement. He urged the president to \u201ckeep together our multinational coalition to defeat ISIS and prevent significant conflict between our NATO ally Turkey and our local Syrian counterterrorism partners.\u201d\n\nForeign policy has long been the issue where Republicans are most likely to disagree with Trump, and it\u2019s not clear that strong words against the president\u2019s Syria policy will cost him any political support. Trump would have to lose the support of at least 20 Republican senators to be removed from office if the House votes to impeach him.\n\nThe harshest criticism Monday came from South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a strong Trump ally and frequent golf companion. Graham said this \u201cimpulsive decision\u201d will benefit Iran and cost the U.S. leverage in the region.\n\nGraham also said he and Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen will introduce sanctions against Turkey if the NATO ally invades Syria. He said he expects such sanctions to get a two-thirds majority -- enough to override a Trump veto.\n\nAfter criticism from Graham and others, Trump tweeted that he would \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if it took \u201coff limits\u201d actions that he didn\u2019t specify. He also said Turkey must \u201cwatch over\u201d about 12,000 captured Islamic State fighters and tens of thousands of their family members living in jails and camps in Kurdish-held territory.\n\nThe Senate earlier this year had a veto-proof margin to pass an amendment authored by McConnell opposing a withdrawal from Syria and Afghanistan. On Monday, Criticism in Congress was bipartisan, focused on the move to abandon Kurdish forces who helped U.S. forces fight ISIS, and who are holding thousands of ISIS fighters in custody.\n\nOther Senate Republicans pushing back on the president include Marco Rubio of Florida, Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine, though none other than Graham have yet said they plan to act on their dismay.\n\nRomney, who heads a Foreign Relations subcommittee on the Middle East and counterterrorism, released a joint statement with Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, the top Democrat on the panel, saying Trump\u2019s decision \u201cseverely undercuts America\u2019s credibility as a reliable partner and creates a power vacuum in the region that benefits ISIS.\u201d They demanded that the administration explain the decision to the full committee.\n\nNebraska Senator Ben Sasse, who is up for re-election next year, warned against partnering with Turkish President Recep Erdogan.\n\n\u201cIf the president sticks with this retreat, he needs to know that this bad decision will likely result in the slaughter of allies who fought with us, including women and children,\u201d Sasse said in a statement Monday. \u201cI hope the president will listen to his generals and reconsider.\u201d\n\nSome House Republicans also criticized the abrupt withdrawal. Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney, a member of GOP leadership, called the decision a \u201ccatastrophic mistake.\u201d New York Republican Elise Stefanik recently returned from a bipartisan trip to the region and joined a statement with Democratic representatives condemning Trump\u2019s \u201crash decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only will this decision further destabilize the region, it will make it more difficult for the United States to recruit allies and partners to defeat terrorist groups like ISIS,\u201d the statement said.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s Senate allies approved of Trump\u2019s decision: Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has long called for withdrawing troops from Syria and Afghanistan.\n\n(Updates with McConnell quote in third paragraph)\n\n--With assistance from Erik Wasson.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Steven T.
