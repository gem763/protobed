The stock currently trades at a slight 10% discount to our fair value and pays a solid forward dividend yield of 3.1%. We'd be buyers of the stock at our 5-star price of just below $150 per share.\n\nWe believe the market has overreacted to two key variables: 1) 3M's latest guidance cut; and 2) 3M's potential PFAS litigation exposure. Since Mike Roman has been at the helm for nearly a year, 3M has been forced to cut guidance on five different occasions. That said, 3M consists of short-cycle businesses that are notoriously hard to predict. Most of the slowdown has come from three distinct end markets which make up over 30% of its revenue base, which include automotive, electronics, and China. And the company simply missed reacting to slowing demand.", "description": "Market sentiment doesn't change our high opinion of this wide-moat firm.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blta49251caf8483084/5cb4f5163aebf35f29365ba8/ContentPackage_Portfolio_Scatter_1x1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-17"}
