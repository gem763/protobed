His business has also been involved in weapons manufacturing, working with the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense to produce a modified version of the M4 and M16 rifles, according to reports.\n\nPELOSI DEFENDS SCHIFF AFTER BEING PRESSED ABOUT HIS 'PARODY' OF TRUMP'S UKRAINE CALL\n\nIn 2013, Pasternak hosted a fundraiser in Washington for Schiff, who later came to embrace a strong stance in support of the United States sending military aid to Ukraine during its conflict with Russia.\n\n\u201cBefore this time, Schiff rarely, if ever, mentioned Ukraine,\u201d Fox News\u2019 Laura Ingraham said on her show Thursday night, after detailing Schiff\u2019s connection to Pasternak. \u201cBut after the fundraiser, he used multiple television appearances to basically demand that we send money and arms to them.\u201d\n\nNeither Schiff nor Pasternak returned requests from Fox News for comment on Thursday.\n\nBut in a February 2015 appearance on CNN, Schiff was asked by anchor Wolf Blitzer, \u201cYou want the United States right now to not only provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine, but also start providing serious weapons, right?\u201d\n\nHe replied: \u201cI do. And I think it's overdue.\u201d\n\nIn another appearance on CNN in February 2015, Schiff said, \u201cI think that the United States should be very forward-leaning on Ukraine.\u201d\n\nAccording to his online biography, Pasternak was born in the former Soviet Union, started his first company in Ukraine, immigrated to the United States in 1993 and is now a U.S. citizen. Since that time, Pasternak\u2019s company has been awarded Ukraine defense contracts.\n\nAn invitation for the July 18, 2013, fundraiser, posted online, invited guests to Pasternak\u2019s home on Capitol Hill. \u201cPlease join Igor Pasternak for a taste of Ukraine Reception honoring Congressman Adam Schiff,\u201d the invite said.\n\nTo attend the fundraisers, sponsors were encouraged to contribute $2,500, and guests were asked to pay $1,000. The invite said checks were payable to \u201cAdam Schiff for Congress.\u201d\n\nAn online search of donor records shows that Pasternak has donated money to politicians and organizations of both parties.\n\nPasternak\u2019s airship company, Worldwide Aeros Corp., is based in Montebello, Calif. The company has won Pentagon contracts to develop airships for surveillance and cargo delivery -- including one contract reportedly worth $50 million.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nIn 2017, Pasternak was quoted in Newsweek talking about his company\u2019s efforts to produce a variant of the M16 rifle in Ukraine. \"The M16 project was conceived some time ago, as the Ukrainian armed forces, border guards and National Guard will with time switch to NATO standards,\" Pasternak said during a press conference in Kiev at the time.\n\nThe scrutiny comes as Democrats ramp up their impeachment inquiry into Trump. Democrats are moving ahead with those efforts after a whistleblower complained that the president, in a July phone call, pressed the president of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, in that country.\n\nSchiff has been singled by Republicans, including Trump himself, in recent days: Republicans have decried how Schiff, during a hearing last week, read a \"parody\" version of Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nRepublicans also slammed Schiff after the Intelligence Committee acknowledged this week that the whistleblower alleging misconduct had reached out to Schiff's panel before filing a complaint.", "description": "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff -- who has played a leading role in investigating the Trump-Ukraine scandal -- is facing questions about his own connection to a Soviet-born businessman who has raised money for his campaign and whose company has received lucrative defense contracts from Ukraine's government.", "authors": ["Alex Pappas", "Alex Pappas Is A Senior Politics Editor At Foxnews.Com."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Schiff-Pasternak-Getty.jpg"}
