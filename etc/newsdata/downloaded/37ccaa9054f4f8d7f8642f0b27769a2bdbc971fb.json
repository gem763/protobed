Within three months we would hope to reach agreement with the EU. We believe that to be possible, along the lines we\u2019ve set out \u2013 and within six months, hold a referendum,\u201d Corbyn said.\n\n\u201cAnd a Labour government would then implement the results of that referendum: between a sensible relationship with Europe, and remain.\u201d\n\nAsked when an election should be, he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll look at any deal that comes up, before we trigger an election\u201d. He said he was keen to focus on other issues, including investment, tackling the climate crisis, and education.\n\nAnd he brushed aside the question of whether he would step down if Labour loses another general election, as shadow chancellor John McDonnell suggested they would in an interview with GQ on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not expecting to lose the next election: it\u2019s a hypothetical question, and it\u2019s up to the members of our party to decide who the leader is.\u201d Asked to identify potential candidates, he said, \u201cI am not into the business of ordaining people.\u201d\n\nAsked what Labour will do if Johnson fails to pass a deal, and refuses to implement the Benn act by requesting a delay to Brexit, Corbyn said his party would, \u201ctake parliamentary action against him at that point \u2013 either by legislation or through a no-confidence vote.\n\nAnd he underlined the fact that Labour believes he should lead any temporary government, if Johnson were to lose a confidence vote.\n\n\u201cOf course: I\u2019m the leader of the opposition. All the British parliamentary precedents, going back as far as you care to look, are that the first option is that the leader of the opposition be invited to form an administration\u201d.\n\nAs the SNP gather for their conference in Aberdeen, Corbyn denied that his party would consider a formal coalition with the party after a general election. \u201cWe\u2019re not going into coalition with anybody,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked about the possibility of Labour supporting a fresh Scottish independence poll, he said, \u201cwe would certainly not countenance it in the early days, or early years, of a Labour government, because I think the 2014 referendum was supposed to be a once in a lifetime opportunity.\u201d", "description": "Labour leader says he would prefer to fight election before any second referendum is held", "authors": ["Heather Stewart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72dc30d811ff4c2e0e80a60ddb31878127a474fa/0_142_6389_3835/master/6389.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fc28ba54c093e87fba7e3ee55b0442bb", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
