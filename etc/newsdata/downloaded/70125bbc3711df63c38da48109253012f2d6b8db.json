More than 96 percent of UAW members have voted to authorize strikes against the Detroit\u2019s automakers if an agreement is not reached. If there is a strike, it would be against GM.\n\nThe union said Tuesday the vote means leadership is authorized to call strikes against not only GM, but Ford and Fiat Chrysler as well. But it doesn\u2019t mean there will be a work stoppage.\n\nMany observers expect a strike as the union seeks pay raises and the companies seek cost parity with foreign automakers that have plants in the U.S.\n\nWorkers Supporting a Possible Strike: General Motors: 96.4% Fiat Chrysler: 96% Ford: 95.98% Source: UAW\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe union represents about 152,000 workers at the three companies.\n\nTension is high this year because the companies have been making billions of dollars in profits and workers want a bigger slice. But the automakers are looking to trim hourly labor costs, which have grown when compared with Southern U.S. factories run by Toyota, Nissan, Hyundai-Kia, Volkswagen and others. GM has also announced plans to shutter four factories in Ohio, Michigan and Maryland, which the union has pledged to fight.\n\nUAW Factory Pay: General Motors: $63 Ford: $61 Fiat Chrysler: $55 Foreign-Based Automakers: $50 *Hourly Wages + Benefits Source: Center for Automotive Research\n\nThe relationship between the United Auto Workers union and its 400,000 active and 580,000 retired members, is growing strained after federal agents raided the home of Gary Jones, the president of the UAW, last week.\n\nThe FBI said it executed a search warrant at a home in Canton Township, Michigan, that is connected to Jones.\n\n\u201cAs soon as news broke of this raid, we were receiving emails and phone calls from factory workers from all over the country who were very angry and very upset,\u201d said Detroit Free Press autos and labor reporter Phoebe Wall Howard during an interview with FOX Business. \u201cAnd so the contracts are due to expire. The factory workers are saying, 'these are the people we count on to advocate on our behalf. And now suspicion continues to grow.'\u201d\n\nJones, who has not been charged, marched in Detroit\u2019s Labor Day parade but exited the route before its completion and didn\u2019t speak to union members. About 20 marchers carried signs calling for the union to be reformed.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The UAW is turning up the heat as contract talks intensify.", "authors": ["Suzanne O'Halloran"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/10/0/0/GM-BT.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-03"}
