After all, Los Angeles may be the best team in the NBA after adding reigning NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard to a roster that challenged the Warriors in last season's playoffs and has scorers and defenders at every level.\n\nHowever, the Thunder no longer have Russell Westbrook and lost their first two games of the season by a combined 17 points.\n\nOklahoma City is the type of team the Warriors should beat if they are still going to challenge for a playoff spot in the daunting Western Conference minus some of the star power. Yet, Stephen Curry was the only Warrior to score more than 10 points, and even he was just 2-of-9 from deep.\n\nGolden State as a whole was 5-of-33 (15.2 percent) from three-point range, which is a far cry from the versions that used to rain jump shots on opponents for 48 minutes.\n\nIf there is a silver lining for the Warriors, it is that they play the New Orleans Pelicans next game. New Orleans is 0-3 on the season and without the injured Zion Williamson, meaning the five-time-defending Western Conference champions have the opportunity to turn things around against an overmatched foe.\n\nIf they don't, Green's outlook will likely get even worse.", "description": "Reality has hit the  Golden State Warriors  hard after they dominated the  NBA  the past five seasons, and  Draymond Green  isn't happy...", "authors": ["Scott Polacek"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/835/290/hi-res-f2beba2e02ebced7310efe50048918b9_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
