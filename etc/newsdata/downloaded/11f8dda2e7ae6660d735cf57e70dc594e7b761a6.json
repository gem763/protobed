Triple negative breast cancer is a form of the disease that does not have receptors for the hormones oestrogen or progesterone, or the protein HER2. This makes it trickier to treat due to the tumour not responding to these hormonal or protein therapies. Triple negative breast cancer makes up around 10-to-20 per cent of all forms of the disease. It tends to be more aggressive than other breast tumours, with patients having a worse prognosis. The condition is more common in those under 40 and black women. It is diagnosed via a sample of the cancerous cells. Symptoms are similar to other forms of breast cancer. These can include: Lump or thickening in the breast\n\nChange in the size, shape or feel of the breast\n\nDimpling of the skin\n\nChange in the shape of the nipple\n\nRash or blood-stained discharge coming from the nipple\n\nSwelling in the armpit Treatment usually involves surgery, chemo and radiotherapy. Chemo may be given first to shrink the tumour before a patient goes under the knife. It may also be given after the operation to prevent the disease returning.\n\nThey then tested how different levels of the specialist cell affected the survival chances of women with triple-negative breast cancer.\n\nFigures show around half of women diagnosed with the killer form of the disease see their cancer come back within five years.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, tracked 11 women from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust in London.\n\nIt found five women recovered from breast cancer and were still in the clear four to five years later.\n\nIn every case, these women had higher levels of gamma delta T cells in their tumours compared to their normal breast.\n\nThe other six patients saw their cancer come back within 18 months and kill them. All but one patient in this group had low levels of gamma delta T cells.\n\nThere are around 55,000 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed each year in the UK, and roughly 268,600 in the US. Around 15 per cent of these are triple negative.\n\nThe aggressive form of the cancer does not respond to hormone therapies, such as Tamoxifen.\n\nIt means scientists seeking a way of helping patients have had to look for alternative immunotherapy treatments.\n\nCo-author Dr Yin Wu, a clinician at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital and University College Hospital, said the findings may lead to new immunotherapy treatments.\n\nShe said: 'It could mean that in the future we're able to improve a patient's chance of survival by either artificially activating more of these cells to fight the tumour cells or we could transfer cells from a donor.'\n\nExperts believe gamma T cells are better at detecting cancer than the body's more common white blood cells, T cells.\n\nCancer cells are able to hide from white blood cells by adapting to change the types of proteins they emit.\n\nGamma delta cells are thought to overcome this problem by detecting unhealthy changes in breast tissue.\n\nThey then recruit the T cells to attack, while also killing and damaging cancer cells themselves.\n\nDr Iain Foulkes, from Cancer Research UK, which part-funded the study, said: 'Treatments that harness the power of the body's own immune system hold great promise for the future of cancer medicine and are already making a real difference for people with some types of cancer.'", "description": "Researchers from Francis Crick Institute and King's College London found a cell known as a 'gamma delta T cell', released by the immune system to fight tumours, in human breast tissue for the first time.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/16/19497302-0-image-a-13_1570633783364.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
