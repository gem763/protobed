And I want you to unite behind the science. And then I want you to take action.\n\nThose lawmakers gathered at the packed testimony were among the most ardent supporters of climate action in congress, but they have struggled to pass meaningful legislation in a senate controlled by Republicans.\n\nPerhaps surprised by the bluntness of Thunberg\u2019s accusation that they were not doing enough to address the climate crisis, some politicians reportedly laughed while others applauded. Mr Markey vowed that those in attendance would ensure climate change was placed at the heart of US politics.\n\n\u201cWe hear you,\u201d Mr Markey responded, vowing that lawmakers \u201cwill redouble our efforts to make sure that we inject this issue into the politics of this building and this country because time is running out.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Thunberg, a number of youth activists from across the Americas were invited to address the task force in an attempt to build momentum for serious climate action in the run-up to a week of global climate strikes beginning on Friday.\n\nThere will be 4,638 events in 139 countries, Thunberg said. In New York City, children will not be penalised for skipping school, while in Australia, the government of Victoria has encouraged people to strike.\n\n\"We want our kids to be engaged in the world around them, so we don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to criticise students for holding a peaceful protest about an issue as important as this,\u201d a government spokesperson said. \"We should celebrate the fact they care enough to want to do something about it.\"", "description": "Former US president Barack Obama met with teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg on Monday, describing her as \u201cone of the planet\u2019s greatest advocates\u201d.
