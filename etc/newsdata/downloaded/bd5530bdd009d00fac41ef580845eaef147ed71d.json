We have no choice but to engage and to attempt to have better understanding of other cultures and try to work through issues. What better way than through sports?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSilver\u2019s attempt to reframe the discussion in terms of \u201cisolationism\u201d term is an inartful dodge. No one\u2019s complaining about the NBA\u2019s programs in Senegal, the Philippines, the Czech Republic, Argentina, Bahrain, or Canada. (The Portland Trail Blazers did end their sponsorship with a rifle scope manufacturer who has contracts with the Israeli military, but the team insists it has nothing to do with anti-Israel protests.) The current controversy has nothing to do with NBA exhibition games in Japan, or Vancouver, or Mumbai, or foreign players on NBA rosters. This isn\u2019t about abstract \u201cisolationism,\u201d this is about how the NBA, its coaches, and players instantly went quiet about Chinese human-rights abuses as soon as it became clear that speaking out would jeopardize the league\u2019s lucrative deals in that country.\n\nNor is Silver\u2019s description of \u201cattempt a better understanding of other cultures\u201d particularly accurate. This isn\u2019t a divide over cultures, this is a divide over government policy. The Chinese government is currently cracking down on protesters in Hong Kong through violent means, and Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey wrote one tweet about it. The Chinese government responded with full-spectrum outrage. The Chinese government believes that no one in the NBA should criticize their policies, and the NBA players, coaches, and league officials appear to agree. When Laura Ingraham tells the players to \u201cshut up and dribble\u201d in response to criticism of Trump, the league and its players are defiant. When Xi Jinping effectively says the same through policy choices and state media, the league and its players meekly acquiesce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSilver told the Journal that the league does not have \u201cofficial relationships again yet with our counterparts in China,\u201d but that \u201cI\u2019m hoping that as two weeks have now gone by, and there seem to be further signals of de-escalation, that we can begin renewing those relationships.\u201d He also characterized the NBA as \u201ccollateral damage\u201d from the ongoing trade war between the United States and China.\n\nWhat would Silver have to see to conclude that the NBA\u2019s partnerships in China are no longer worth pursuing?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you notice how in a lot of our discussion of public policy, the ratchet only turns in one direction? Problems that stem from engagement with China can only be solved by more engagement with China.\n\nThe problems that big government programs have failed to solve can only be addressed by bigger government programs. Government efforts to pay for higher education have driven up costs, so the only answer is bigger and more expensive government efforts to pay for higher education.\n\nWe never seem to reach the point where advocates say, \u201coh, no, wait, we were wrong, this approach isn\u2019t working at all.\u201d", "description": "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver declares in an interview that he \u201crespectfully disagrees\u201d with those who believe the NBA should disengage with China. \u201c", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
