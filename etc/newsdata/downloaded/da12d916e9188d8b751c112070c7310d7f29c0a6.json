Perez won for her work on last year\u2019s \"Florida\u2019s Disposable Workers\" project, which exposed how Florida companies were hiring undocumented immigrants for high-risk jobs and then using a state law to avoid covering them for on-the-job injuries.\n\nPerez worked on the year-long project in Naples and as part of the O\u2019Brien Fellowship with Marquette University and the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. Her investigation uncovered 159 undocumented workers who were denied workers compensation benefits after they were injured and their employers or their insurance companies reported them to regulators.\n\nMeanwhile, companies that knowingly hire undocumented workers rarely get in trouble. Perez found one instance where a Florida company was charged since 2003. State Sen. Gary Farmer, D-Fort Lauderdale, proposed making changes to the law this February.\n\n\u201cMaria Perez and the team behind the \u2018Disposable Workers\u2019 project are certainly deserving of this national recognition of meaningful journalism,\u201d said Chris Davis, head of investigative journalism at USA TODAY NETWORK. \u201cMaria\u2019s passion for this project underscored her deep commitment to investigative reporting \u2013 a core value of the broader USA NETWORK as well.\u201d\n\nSince joining the Naples Daily News in 2014, Maria has told the stories of undocumented immigrants, providing a voice to this rapidly growing population in Florida. She previously worked at el Nuevo Herald and as a reporter in her native Spain. Maria is a 2013 graduate of Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and earned a dual bachelor\u2019s degree in law and journalism at Carlos III University in Getafe, Spain.\n\nThe 2017 George Polk Awards honored a total of 17 journalists. Perez shared the Immigration Reporting Award with Antonia Farzan and Joseph Flaherty of the Phoenix New Times.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2EJjNwR", "description": "Naples Daily News reporter Maria Perez was named a winner of the prestigious George Polk Award for immigration reporting.", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published P.M.
