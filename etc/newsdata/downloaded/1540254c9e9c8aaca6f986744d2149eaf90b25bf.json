Instead, it enables apps to share the same system resources and are shipped only with those components they need in order to operate, thereby reducing their overall size.\n\nUpon alerted by Unit 42, Docker removed the malicious images \u2014 a shareable \u201cdigital snapshot\u201d of a pre-configured application running on top of an operating system \u2014 from Docker Hub, a code repository from where it had been downloaded more than a collective 16,000 times.\n\nCredit: Unit 42 / Palo Alto Networks The Graboid worm\n\nAs businesses increasingly migrate to the cloud, the research underscores the need to beef up security conrols or else risk getting exposed to targeted reconnaissance, the cybersecurity firm said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to see instances where the failure to properly configure containers can lead to the loss of sensitive information and as a result, default configurations can be significant security risks for organizations,\u201d Unit 42\u2019s Senior Cloud Vulnerability and Exploit Researcher Jay Chen told TNW.\n\nThe worm propagation\n\nUnit 42 said it discovered the worm late last month after the same malicious image in question appeared across several unsecured Docker hosts that were discovered on Shodan, a search engine used to identify systems that are connected to the internet.\n\nOnce remotedly deployed and installed, the contaminated container image \u2014 which also comprises of a program to contact other hosts \u2014 connects to a remote command-and-control server to periodically query for vulnerable hosts and select a target at random to spread the worm.\n\n\u201cWe have a growing concern attackers will continue to exploit these issues in unpatched instances to spread their footprint by escaping containers and gaining persistence on the container hosts and more can definitely be done to secure them,\u201d Chen told TNW. \u201cMany of these malicious images are disguised as other popular container images while containing a backdoor, sometimes retaining the original image\u2019s functionality to avoid getting detected.\u201d\n\nCredit: Unit 42 / Palo Alto Networks The malicious Docker images\n\nThe threat actor leveraged over 2,034 vulnerable hosts this way, Unit 42 said, stating that 57.4 percent of the IP addresses originated from China, followed by 13 percent from the US, and that there are, on average, 900 active miners at any given point of time.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nThis is far from the first time the container architecture has been exploited to install cryptocurrency-mining malware.\n\nPrevious disclosures from Trend Micro and Imperva have found exposed Docker hosts to be an actively abused attack surface in cryptojacking operations that make use of Shodan to discover and infect more victims.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Docker. Similar instances of exposed hosts have been uncovered on Kubernetes \u2014 an open-source PaaS system originally designed by Google \u2014 as well.\n\nCredit: Unit 42 / Palo Alto Networks Affected Docker hosts by geography\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t observed this specific worm in Kubernetes, but earlier this year, our research found that some 20,353 Kubernetes [containers] around the world operate under default configurations,\u201d Chen told TNW. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that these platforms are vulnerable to exploits, but it demonstrates that seemingly basic misconfiguration practices exist in large quantities and as attacks continue to evolve, it will make organizations targets for further compromising events.\u201d\n\nAlthough Graboid\u2019s tactics and techniques aren\u2019t sophisticated, it\u2019s crucial that organizations secure their Docker hosts, monitor their network traffic, and most importantly refrain from downloading Docker images from unknown sources.\n\n\u201cAs your organization\u2019s cloud footprint grows, being able to automatically model and whitelist application behavior becomes a powerful tool for securing cloud workloads against attacks and compromises,\u201d Chen said.\n\nRead next: The rate of the universe's expansion is in dispute \u2013 but a new kind of measurement offers hope", "description": "Unit 42 researchers have uncovered the first-ever instance case of a cryptojacking worm called Graboid that propagates via malicious Docker images.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2015%2F08%2Fdocker.jpg&signature=db6912960cfb6b0f72bbc58baa912ba7", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
