Two teams in the up-and-down division blew 20-point leads on the same day - and still managed to win.\n\nThe division seems poised for another wacky stretch run to sort out which of the Coastal\u2019s mostly mediocre members will earn the right to most likely lose to the second-ranked Tigers in the title game.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re at a carnival going onto one of the rides - now here is the Coastal ride,\u201d Virginia coach Bronco Mendenhall quipped. \u201cAnd holy cow, you never know what\u2019s going to happen when you\u2019re on that ride.\u201d\n\nA week into October, and his 20th-ranked Cavaliers (4-1, 2-0) are the lone Coastal team without a league loss.\n\nLooking at the history of the division, the Cavaliers aren\u2019t likely to finish that way.\n\nSince the ACC expanded to 14 teams in 2013, the only Coastal champion to finish 8-0 in league play was North Carolina in 2015. Meanwhile, four other division winners had two league losses. Last year\u2019s winner, Pittsburgh, had an overall record of 7-7.\n\n\u201cWhen I say (it\u2019s) even, a lot of people think of that as a bunch of average teams,\u201d Duke coach David Cutcliffe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nNo Coastal team has won the league championship since Virginia Tech in 2010. Florida State and Clemson have combined for four undefeated finishes in ACC play and all eight titles during that timeframe.\n\nThat is the key difference between the divisions.\n\nFor much of the past decade, the ACC as a whole - and the Atlantic Division in particular - has been dominated by one powerhouse program, either the Seminoles or Clemson.\n\nThe Coastal has been a free-for-all, with six different champions in six years. The only team that hasn\u2019t won it in that stretch - Virginia - currently holds first place. And only once since 2013 has a Coastal team has finished in the top 10 of the final AP Top 25, when Georgia Tech ended 2014 at No. 8.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no singular program that has in recent years been able to have that consistency year to year to win the division,\u201d ACC Commissioner John Swofford said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of fascinating to watch. And we\u2019ve had some really entertaining games.\u201d\n\nThe data indicates more parity: In Jeff Sagarin\u2019s latest computer ratings, five Coastal schools - Virginia, Duke, North Carolina, Pittsburgh and Miami - are bunched between Nos. 31 and 55 nationally. Of the four highest-ranked ACC teams, three (Clemson, Wake Forest and Florida State) are in the Atlantic.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a very balanced league, the ACC overall and especially the Coastal Division,\u201d Duke quarterback Quentin Harris said. \u201cYou have a lot of teams that are really good teams, and if you don\u2019t bring your best effort, you could easily find yourself on the wrong side of a score or a shootout - or even a defensive battle, too.\u201d\n\nThat parity tends to produce days like this past Saturday, when in the span of a few hours, two Coastal teams let huge leads slip away before regrouping to beat division rivals.\n\nVirginia Tech was up by 28 points on Miami before the Hurricanes scored three touchdowns in less than 4 minutes late to tie it. The Hokies came up with the winning touchdown with 1:03 remaining.\n\nA few hours later, Pittsburgh staged an even more daunting escape at Duke.\n\nIn a game that had a combined 10 turnovers, the Panthers led by 23 points with less than 3 minutes left in the third quarter before the Blue Devils reeled off 27 straight points to take a 30-26 lead with 1:30 remaining.\n\nKenny Pickett then threw a touchdown pass with 38 seconds left to give the Panthers a 33-30 victory and cap what Pitt defensive back Dane Jackson called one of the \u201cprobably top-five, top-three\u201d wildest games of the redshirt senior\u2019s career.\n\nThere\u2019s a good chance there could be more during the second half of the season.\n\nHis Panthers (4-2, 1-1) have a chance to repeat as Coastal champs with a schedule built for a stretch run: None of their final six opponents own a record better than 3-2.\n\nVirginia holds the tiebreaker with Pitt, but the division might come down to the finale against rival Virginia Tech - which has won the last 15 meetings in the series. And don\u2019t count out Duke or North Carolina - which fell one point shy of upsetting Clemson in what would have been the season\u2019s biggest upset.\n\n\u201cJust from that (Virginia Tech-Miami) game alone,\u201d Virginia safety Joey Blount said, \u201cyou can tell that the Coastal, or the ACC in general, is up for grabs.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Hank Kurz Jr. in Charlottesville, Virginia, and Aaron Beard in Charlotte, North Carolina, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Chaos is brewing in the ACC's Coastal Division once again.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joedy Mccreary"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/acc-more_coastal_chaos_football_68522_c0-170-3000-1919_s1770x1032.jpg?54054ef87b1176dcb64faaadcaaac6f7a2a6d5b9", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
