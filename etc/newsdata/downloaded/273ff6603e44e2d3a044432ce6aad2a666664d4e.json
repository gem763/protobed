The pills, authorities allege, contained lethal amounts of fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin.\n\nMiller, 26, was discovered unresponsive in his Studio City home two days after buying the pills, prosecutors said. The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner determined he\u2019d had an accidental overdose on alcohol, cocaine, and fentanyl, authorities said.\n\n\u201cFentanyl disguised as a genuine pharmaceutical is a killer\u2014which is being proven every day in America,\u201d United States Attorney Nick Hanna said in a press release announcing the charges, which were first reported by NBC News. \u201cDrugs laced with cheap and potent fentanyl are increasingly common, and we owe it to the victims and their families to aggressively target the drug dealers that cause these overdose deaths.\u201d\n\nIn a 42-page criminal complaint filed Friday in the Central District of California, prosecutors allege Pettit delivered the rapper, whose real name is Malcolm James McCormick, 10 \u201c30 milligram oxycodone pills, as well as cocaine and the sedative Xanax\u201d early in the morning after the rapper texted asking for \u201cpercs,\u201d or percocet, a prescribed painkiller which contains oxycodone.\n\nProsecutors allege that Pettit had supplied the rapper with drugs multiple times in the past and the two often texted about plans to drop off various drugs and to settle payment plans.\n\nBut instead of providing Miller with genuine oxycodone when he made the delivery around 2:25 a.m., Pettit allegedly sold McCormick fake pills that contained fentanyl.\n\n\u201cWhile another alleged drug dealer allegedly supplied McCormick with other drugs prior to his death...investigators believe that McCormick died after snorting the counterfeit oxycodone pills containing fentanyl and that those pills had been provided by Pettit,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nWhen Miller was discovered on Sept. 7, investigators recovered a plastic bag containing pills that were allegedly supplied by Pettit and a prostitute, the complaint states. Hours after reports of Miller\u2019s death, Pettit direct messaged a friend on Instagram about the death and his possible involvement.\n\n\u201cI think I should probably not post anything \u2026just to be smart,\u201d Petit allegedly messaged one friend.\n\nWhen asked by another friend via Instagram message how he was doing, Petit allegedly wrote: \u201cI am not great...Most likely I will die in jail.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna get off the grid,\u201d he added.\n\nPettit, who was arrested Wednesday, is expected to make an initial court appearance this afternoon in Los Angeles. It was not immediately clear if he has an attorney.\n\nIf convicted, Pettit faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.", "description": "He allegedly supplied Miller with fake oxycodone pills that were laced with fentanyl two days before the rapper was found dead in his home on Sept. 7, 2018.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567626178/190904-pilar-mac-miller-tease_douvye"}
