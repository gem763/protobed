The AMPFPA has previously held introductory talks with litigation funders to scope out the viability of such a case.\n\nAMP\u2019s network of around 2000 planners were shocked to learn the company had unilaterally changed the terms of the buyer of last resort (BOLR) scheme on August 7.\n\nThe changes were unveiled as part of a massive strategic overhaul that would see the firm sell its life insurance business and ramp up its banking operations.\n\nThe BOLR had been in place for many years at 4 times recurring earnings but after the revamp it had been cut to 2.5 times, leaving many advisers that had bought practices from AMP in significant debt.\n\nThe company has told many of its adviser force \u2013 who are not employed but merely aligned with the company \u2013 their services are no longer required and asked them to find a new licensee, sell the business back to AMP at the lower multiple or sell or merge their business with that of another AMP adviser.\n\nAdvisers have been given a Halloween deadline to choose a course of action with many planners saying they are being pressured by AMP to bulk up and buy other AMP practices in order to remain viable and keep their relationship with the company.\n\nAMP shares rallied 4 per cent or 6.5c to $1.67 and-a-half by midday on a stronger day for financial stocks more broadly, following several strong sessions on Wall Street.\n\nThe recovery followed a record low share price of $1.57 a share reached on Thursday and follows a $784 million capital raising at $1.60 a share to fund and accelerate the transformation plan.", "description": "Aggrieved financial planners are being urged to stick together as they prepare for a showdown in court.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3512%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_730%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/faf8aa691284fd0bfd0e4a995f69d1ed876070db", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
