The researchers monitored the dolphins' behavior, noting certain traits like aggression (indicated by head jerks or a jaw clap), or interest (shown by raising their chin, or pressing their forehead against the TV), or the blowing of bubbles (which can either be a sign of aggression or interest)\n\nResearchers then monitored the dolphins' behavior for signs of interest, such as pressing their heads against the glass or nodding their heads, or signs of aggression, such as clamping their jaws or swimming with jerky movements.\n\nThey found that the dolphins didn't really mind what was on the TV, but certain dolphins showed more interest in the pictures than others.\n\n'Rough\u2010toothed dolphins displayed significantly more behaviors, particularly interest and bubble behaviors, than bottlenose dolphins, with no differences observed between the species for the percentage of time spent watching,' the researchers wrote in the journal Zoo Biology.\n\n'Among bottlenose dolphins, males watched the television longer, and responded behaviorally significantly more, displaying a higher rate of bubble and aggressive behaviors than females.\n\nResearchers played scenes from Sir David Attenborough's Planet Earth and Spongebob Squarepants among other shows\n\n'Male rough\u2010toothed dolphins displayed significantly more aggressive behaviors than females, with no other sex differences noted.'\n\nThose aggressive behaviours may be due to the inability for these dolphins to physically interact with or manipulate the TV, the study concluded.\n\nIn the future, researchers think TV could be useful as an 'enrichment device,' so long their species, sex and individual differences are taken into consideration.\n\nMonitoring how dolphins respond to different videos could also provide new ways to study how they think.", "description": "Researchers at the Dolphins Plus Marine Mammal Responder in Key Largo, Florida, played videos on a TV screen through underwater windows.", "authors": ["Mark Prigg For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/12/18/00/7548020-0-image-a-26_1545093842746.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-18"}
