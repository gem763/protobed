Another four attempts on people\u2019s lives failed, the report said. The victims were singled out because of their efforts to halt the criminal logging, HRW said.\n\nOnly two of the murder cases have made it to trial, and criminal charges have been filed only in one of the cases of threats or attacks, according to HRW. Part of the problem is that local authorities are sometimes complicit in the crimes, said Maria Helena Gaviao, a representative of indigenous women who spoke at the presentation of the report.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to fight at the same time against the authorities\u201d and against the criminals, she said, adding that people arrested are often released shortly afterward.\n\nAmong those killed are indigenous peoples who try to stop the loggers, such as Eusebio Ka\u2019apor, a leader of the Ka\u2019apor tribe who was shot in the back by two attackers on a motorcycle in 2015. The tribal chief had helped organize forest patrols to try to stop loggers from entering their reservation.\n\nEnvironmental activists, local farmers and even police and other authorities also have been murdered by suspected loggers, HRW said. The report comes out as world-wide attention has been focused on fires in the Amazon where about 1,800 square miles of rainforest have been cleared from January through the end of July, an increase of nearly 70% from the same period a year earlier, according to Brazil\u2019s space agency.\n\nFarmers, ranchers and other land grabbers sometimes set fires in the forest to clear land for planting crops, grazing cattle or other uses, and the number of blazes in the Amazon has more than doubled since 2018, the space agency said.\n\nThe jumps in the number of fires and deforestation come after President Jair Bolsonaro was sworn in on Jan. 1. During the election campaign, Mr. Bolsonaro often talked about the need to allow more development in the Amazon. His administration has implemented measures that make it easier to get away with environmental crimes, including reducing the number of raids by environmental authorities and abandoning a system that monitored suspicious cash transfers in the region.\n\n\u201cHis words and actions have effectively given a green light to the criminal networks involved in illegal logging, according to environmental officials and local residents,\u201d the HRW report said.\n\nMr. Bolsonaro, who ran on anticorruption and law-and-order platforms, has defended his government\u2019s record, saying his administration has zero tolerance of crime, including environmental offenses.\n\nThe fight against illegal logging is uneven, against people \u201cwith much more power than we have,\u201d said Rubens Ricupero, a former environment minister in Brazil who also spoke at the presentation of the report. \u201cThe government here is clearly anti-environment.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the speakers at the presentation of the report, including former environment minister and president candidate Marina Silva, called for activists and consumers to continue to put pressure on the government and on Brazil\u2019s powerful farming sector, saying those efforts can force a change.\n\nThe majority of Brazilians want to protect the Amazon, and they need to take to the streets to try to force the government to change its policies, Ms. Silva said.\n\n\u201cBrazilian society has to march, to have a peaceful presence that will deauthorize those policies. And the more diverse they are, the better,\u201d she said. \u201cThat can make a big difference.\u201d\n\nWrite to Jeffrey T.
