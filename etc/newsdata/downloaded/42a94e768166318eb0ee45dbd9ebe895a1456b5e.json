The previous Obama administration rules required employers to provide birth control coverage with no co-payment.\n\n\u201cThe panel held that the religious exemption contradicts congressional intent that all women have access to appropriate preventative care and the exemption operates in a manner fully at odds with the careful, individualized, and searching review mandated by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,\u201d Judge J. Clifford Wallace wrote for the majority.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra led 13 other state attorneys general in a lawsuit against the administration challenging the exemptions.\n\n\u201cToday will serve as a reminder to the Trump Administration that politicians and employers certainly have no business interfering with women\u2019s reproductive healthcare,\u201d Becerra said in a statement.\n\nSenior Circuit Judge Andrew Kleinfeld, a George H.W. Bush appointee who leans conservative, penned a dissent, arguing that the case has more to do with states looking to save money than it has to do with women\u2019s health care. He added that the decision is redundant because a judge in Pennsylvania has already halted the administration\u2019s birth control exceptions.\n\n\u201cThe casual reader may imagine that the dispute is about provision of contraception and abortion services to women. It is not.\u201d Kleinfeld wrote. \u201cNo woman sued for an injunction in this case, and no affidavits have been submitted from any women establishing any question in this case about whether they will be deprived of reproductive services or harmed in any way by the modification of the regulation. This case is a claim by several states to prevent a modification of a regulation from going into effect, claiming that it will cost them money.\u201d\n\nUntil the matter is resolved, the court\u2019s decision will prevent the new rules from being implemented in California, Delaware, Virginia, Maryland, New York, Illinois, Washington, Minnesota, Connecticut, North Carolina, Vermont, Rhode Island, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia.", "description": "A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit stated that the administration's new rules fly in the face of the Affordable Care Act.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
