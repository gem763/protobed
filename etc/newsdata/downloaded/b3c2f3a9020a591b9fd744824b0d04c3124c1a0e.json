Peter Rae\n\nScott Morrison sent Australia\u2019s corporate class a message this week: stop wasting your time on elitist feel-good social causes and identity politics, and get on with explaining to middle Australians how practical, productivity-boosting economic reforms will help improve their lives. The Prime Minister has backed his assistant minister for busting red tape, Ben Morton, who this week told an Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry lunch that business should not expect any favours as long it prefers to \u201cpander and succumb\u201d to noisy self-appointed moralists like GetUp. The Liberal Party was not \u201cthe political wing of business\u201d, Mr Morton warned. The government was \u201cnot interested in what\u2019s good for corporate Australia if it\u2019s just good for corporate Australia\u201d.\n\nTreating business as just another interest group that must demonstrate how it can help Mr Morrison\u2019s \u201chard-working, aspirational Australians\u201d misses the point that Mr Morton elsewhere accepts. This is, as he says, that business should act honestly and within the law, provide the best possible product or service to customers, and maximise return to its shareholders. In a competitive market economy, good businesses that create jobs, pay taxes, improve their communities and invest in the future by definition drive the prosperity of all Australians. Politicians like Mr Morton can help business improve the lot of working Australians by getting on with his job of reducing red tape and as well as Australian\u2019s high company tax rate, two areas where the Coalition has dropped the ball. Building a genuine economic reform agenda to sharpen the incentives to work, save, invest and hire would be good for both business and for the great bulk of Australians. Business should do more to argue the case for this. But the government should not blame business for its failure to govern.\n\nSome in the Coalition yearn for the days, now long gone, when business could be closely aligned with the Liberal Party. And some in the Coalition are annoyed with parts of business for backing various social causes and caving in to left-wing political activists. Yes, big listed companies need to be careful about jumping onto whatever cause becomes fashionable, but which would not be supported by many of their customers or employees. Yet, in the same-sex marriage issue, business leaders such as Qantas\u2019 Alan Joyce were on the side of the great bulk of Australians, as were the majority of Coalition MPs in the final vote. And Mr Joyce has led the debate on industrial relations and tax reform, including his bold grounding of Qantas in 2011 in order to force through workplace changes that have made the airline profitable again. Now Mr Joyce is pushing back against climate change activists seeking to \u201cflight shame\u201d the airline industry with sin taxes or similar. But, increasingly, the social activist pressure on big listed companies is coming through the capital markets, including through some industry superannuation funds and politicised shareholder activist groups. What happens when the political activists control your shareholders?\n\nMr Morton\u2019s call comes weeks after Treasurer Josh Frydenberg urged business to \u201cback themselves\u201d rather than to lapse into an easy \u201cdefault option\u201d of handing surplus cash back to investors instead of seeking out new investment opportunities. Yet even in the world of cheap money, the question confronting boards is whether the risk-weighted returns from investing in future production are higher than the returns to shareholders from buying back their shares. As Mr Morton says, companies are required to \u201cmaximise return to their shareholders\u201d. Yet the populist clamour is raising the risk-adjusted hurdle for productive investment. Regulators are suing banks for \u201cirresponsible\u201d lending to borrowers who don\u2019t default. A Coalition government slapped a special tax on the big banks because no one likes them. Not long ago praised as national champions, gas exporters are threatened with Third World export restraints. And after confronting a decade of political failure over energy policy, a Coalition government is re-regulating the domestic energy market and confronting energy companies with a \u201cbig stick\u201d threat of break-up. That won\u2019t encourage the energy investment that the quiet Australians need to keep the lights on.", "description": "Businesses must do more to spread the reform message -- but they can't be blamed for failure to govern.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_441%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5a4d8f9b5883eb6d6b84e59e9d76341f4961d94e", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
