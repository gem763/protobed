The agreed price takes account of previous investments made by the buyer into Atlas\u2019s business, he said.\n\n\"This will be the first African-focused sale for Atlas Towers,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nSBA, which is headquartered in Florida in the US, owns towers throughout North and South America.\n\n\u201cWe believe South Africa represents a fantastic growth opportunity,\u201d SBA CEO Jeffrey A. Stoops told RCR Wireless News recently. \u201cWe look forward to incremental growth opportunities throughout South Africa over the coming years as the wireless carriers in this market continue to invest meaningfully in 4G and, at some point, 5G deployments.\u201d\n\nRising demand for high-speed internet across Africa has made the tower industry a hotbed for deal making, with wireless carriers looking to sell out to specialist providers. South Africa is seen as a particularly attractive market, as the country is looking to start 5G services over the next two years.\n\nHelios Towers raised $364 million in a London share sale earlier this month as investors looked to capitalize on the growth of tower services in countries such as Tanzania, Ghana and South Africa. American Tower Corp. agreed to buy Eaton Towers Ltd. for about $1.85 billion in May to combine resources on the continent.", "description": "\u201cWe believe South Africa represents a fantastic growth opportunity.\"", "authors": ["Loni Prinsloo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2661/e97bb0b96e224dcc9ce945464fe1b2f9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
