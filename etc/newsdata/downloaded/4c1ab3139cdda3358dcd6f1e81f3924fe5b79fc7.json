Barr has voiced his own concerns, telling lawmakers in April that he believed \u201cspying did occur\u201d when it came to the U.S. investigation of the Trump campaign.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe direct involvement of the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official shows the priority Barr places on the investigation being conducted by John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, who has been assigned the sensitive task of reviewing U.S. intelligence work surrounding the 2016 election and its aftermath.\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s active role also underscores the degree to which a nearly three-year old election still consumes significant resources and attention inside the federal government. Current and former intelligence and law enforcement officials expressed frustration and alarm Monday that the head of the Justice Department was taking such a direct role in re-examining what they view as conspiracy theories and baseless allegations of misconduct.\n\nBarr has already made overtures to British intelligence officials, and last week the attorney general traveled to Italy, where he and Durham met senior Italian government officials and Barr asked the Italians to assist Durham, according to one person familiar with the matter. It was not Barr\u2019s first trip to Italy to meet intelligence officials, the person said. The Trump administration has made similar requests of Australia, these people said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a recent phone call, Trump urged Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to provide assistance to the ongoing Justice Department inquiry, according to a person familiar with the matter. Trump made the request at Barr\u2019s urging, people familiar with the matter said. The Trump phone call was first reported by the New York Times.\n\nTrump administration officials defended the moves as above board.\n\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley said: \u201cI\u2019m old enough to remember when Democrats actually wanted to find out what happened in the 2016 election. The Democrats clearly don\u2019t want the truth to come out anymore as it might hurt them politically, but this call relates to a DOJ inquiry publicly announced months ago to uncover exactly what happened. The DOJ simply requested the President provide introductions to facilitate that ongoing inquiry, and he did so, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said, \u201cMr. Durham is gathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries. At Attorney General Barr\u2019s request, the President has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the Attorney General and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the Australian government said it has \u201calways been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation. The [prime minister] confirmed this readiness once again in a conversation with the President.\u201d\n\nBarr taps U.S. attorney in Connecticut to investigate origins of Russia probe\n\nTrump still complains frequently that those involved in the investigation of his campaign should be charged with crimes, asserting the FBI search for possible election season collusion between Russia and Trump campaign officials was a witch hunt spurred by agents and bureaucrats opposed to Trump becoming president. That investigation ended earlier this year when special counsel Robert S. Mueller III determined there was insufficient evidence to charge any Americans with conspiring with Russia, and declined to reach a decision about whether the president had sought to obstruct justice.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDavid Laufman, a former Justice Department official who was involved in the early stages of the Russia probe, said it was \u201cfairly unorthodox for the attorney general personally to be flying around the world as a point person to further evidence-gathering for a specific Justice Department investigation,\u201d and especially so in Barr\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cEven if one questions, as a threshold matter, the propriety of conducting a re-investigation of the Justice Department\u2019s own prior investigation of Russia\u2019s interference, the appointment of John Durham \u2014 a seasoned, nonpartisan prosecutor \u2014 provided some reason to believe that it would be handled in a professional, nonpartisan manner,\u201d Laufman said. \u201cBut if the attorney general is essentially running this investigation, that entire premise is out the window.\u201d\n\nBarr\u2019s direct involvement in the effort also helps explain part of the controversial July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A rough transcript of that call shows Trump said he wanted Ukrainian assistance to help find out \u201cwhat happened with this whole situation with Ukraine,\u201d and possible involvement with the Democratic National Committee computer system that U.S. agencies have determined was hacked by Russian intelligence ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome of the president\u2019s supporters have suggested Ukraine had a more direct role in the 2016 investigation than currently known, an assertion denied by current and former officials who were involved in the original probe.\n\nA person familiar with Barr\u2019s interactions with foreign officials described them as being official introductions to Durham. The attorney general \u201cis telling people he wants to make sure that the rules governing U.S. agencies have been followed,\u201d this person said.\n\nA spokesperson for the CIA declined to comment, citing the ongoing review.\n\nTrump gives Barr power to declassify intelligence related to Russia probe\n\nA former senior U.S. intelligence official denied the CIA was involved in monitoring any members of the Trump campaign. Any such operations were conducted by the FBI and were lawful, the former official said, emphasizing that the CIA focused on Russia\u2019s interference in the election, and the role that Russian officials and intelligence agencies played.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats are likely to bristle at the notion of the attorney general devoting personal time and energy to traveling overseas asking foreign countries to assist in an investigation of U.S. agencies and personnel, particularly since Democrats have accused Barr in the past of acting in Trump\u2019s interests at the expense of the Justice Department\u2019s independence.\n\nLast week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) accused the attorney general of \u201cgoing rogue\u201d after the Justice Department determined the substance of an explosive whistleblower\u2019s complaint \u2014 alleging that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, over Hunter Biden\u2019s past position on the board of a Ukrainian energy company \u2014 did not merit a criminal investigation.\n\nHouse Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry to further probe the interactions of Trump and his lawyer with the Ukrainians.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring the call with his Ukrainian counterpart, Trump suggested Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, could help Zelensky\u2019s government investigate the matter. A spokeswoman for Barr has said the attorney general was unaware of any such effort, and had not spoken to the president about the issue, nor to Ukrainian authorities.\n\nGiuliani has met with Ukrainian officials and urged them to investigate the Bidens, but insists there is nothing improper about that. Giuliani has declined to discuss Durham\u2019s investigation.\n\nAttorney general says he believes \u2018spying did occur\u2019 in probe of Trump campaign associates\n\nBarr\u2019s conversations with foreign counterparts have raised concerns among some intelligence officials that he may be seeking to substantiate conspiracy theories raised by some on the political right to defend Trump.\n\nAD\n\nOne area that has been of sustained interest to Barr and Durham, according to people familiar with the matter, is a murky figure named Joseph Mifsud.\n\nAD\n\nMifsud, a European academic, was publicly linked to Russian interference efforts in late 2017, when Mueller revealed a guilty plea by former Trump campaign staffer George Papadopoulos, who admitted he had lied to the FBI about the details of his interactions with Mifsud.\n\nThose conversations included an April 2016 meeting in which Mifsud allegedly alerted Papadopoulos that the Russians had \u201cdirt\u201d on Trump\u2019s opponent, Hillary Clinton, in the form of thousands of emails.\n\nA version of that conversation was relayed to U.S. authorities later that summer by an Australian diplomat who had talked to Papadopoulos over drinks in London.\n\nShortly after his name surfaced publicly, Mifsud told Italian media he did not work for Russia. \u201cI never got any money from the Russians: my conscience is clear,\u201d Mifsud told La Repubblica. \u201cI am not a secret agent.\u201d\n\nSince then, the professor has disappeared from public life, leading to a host of theories about him and his whereabouts. While court papers filed in Mueller\u2019s investigation suggested Mifsud operated in Russia\u2019s interests, conservatives and conspiracy theorists have suggested he was instead aligned with Western intelligence agencies.\n\nIn an interview on Fox News in April, Giuliani called Mifsud \u201ca counterintelligence operative, either Maltese or Italian,\u201d who took part in what sounded to him like a \u201ccounterintelligence trap\u201d against Papadopoulos.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what Durham or Barr have come to suspect about Mifsud.\n\nBarr met with British officials in London over the summer to discuss the Durham probe, said a U.S. official familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the investigation. In those conversations, according to this official, Barr expressed a belief that the U.S. investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election stemmed from some corrupt origin, the official said.\n\nIt was not clear what Barr thought was amiss, but he expressed a suspicion that information had been improperly gathered overseas about people connected with the Trump campaign, and that the British may have unwittingly assisted those efforts, the official said.\n\nAnother person familiar with Barr\u2019s efforts denied that characterization, saying he has been seeking cooperation for Durham\u2019s work, and not trying to promote a particular theory or accusation against U.S. agents and officers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s well known within the intelligence community that you cannot ask another government to do something that you\u2019re prohibited from doing. That it is standard operating procedure,\u201d said a former national security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation.\n\nAn executive order governing U.S. intelligence activities states that no intelligence agency \u201cshall participate in or request any person to undertake activities forbidden\u201d by the order, which was issued in 1981.\n\nAs a young man, Barr worked as a lawyer at the CIA and has an ongoing interest in intelligence matters, according to those who know him well. In his public comments about the Russia interference investigation, he has suggested there were failures among former FBI leaders, and that intelligence agency rules about spying on Americans should be scrupulously followed regardless of party affiliation.\n\nThere are two primary efforts underway to scrutinize the 2016 investigation and its aftermath. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is expected to issue in the coming weeks a lengthy report analyzing work done by the FBI and Justice Department to pursue alleged Russian election interference, and the applications for a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court order that approved electronic surveillance of the communications of Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser.\n\nSeparately, Durham is taking a broader look at the actions of intelligence agencies overseas and domestically. Durham has a long track record of being tasked with difficult investigations that involve the CIA or other intelligence agencies. His past investigations have often lasted years, so it\u2019s unclear when Durham\u2019s review might wrap up, but it is unlikely to be soon, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nBefore Durham\u2019s appointment, another U.S. attorney was tasked with reviewing the Clinton email investigation, but the results of that work are still unknown. The multiple investigations show just how much the political conflict of 2016 continues to be an obsession within the government.\n\nLast week, The Washington Post reported that State Department security officials were re-examining aspects of the Clinton email investigation, in which State Department business was conducted on Clinton\u2019s private server when she was secretary of state.\n\nTom Hamburger, Ellen Nakashima and Josh Dawsey contributed to this report.", "description": "The attorney general has made face-to-face overtures to British and Italian officials as part of the effort, people familiar with the matter say.", "authors": ["Devlin Barrett", "Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Law Enforcement", "Shane Harris", "Intelligence", "National Security Reporter", "Matt Zapotosky", "National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/k4u9PCdPS5W3Ze-grmLAbjLIzEs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AXL5ZBFEGII6TJ3H26VYJLXT5E.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
