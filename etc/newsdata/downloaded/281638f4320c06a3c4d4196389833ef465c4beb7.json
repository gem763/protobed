You're staying in the more positive emotions of love, joy, and abundance.\n\n'When a relationship is not aligned with where you're at in life it will weigh you down because you're either giving too much energy away that isn't reciprocated or giving energy that doesn't help your growth (sometimes even stopping your growth because it takes so much out of you).\n\n'By allowing yourself to graciously and humbly 'cut cords' with a relationship, you're committing to taking your energy back so you can use it for things that lift your mood and better align with your highest self.\n\nSo, what is a cord-cutting ceremony?\n\nThe first step is 'finding a sacred space' - this should be somewhere you can pray or meditate and could even be a quiet spot inside your own home. In short, anywhere you feel 'grounded' and at ease.\n\nMom life: Mom-of-three Sophie developed the ritual after she wanted to remove toxic relationships from her life two years ago\n\nNext, to clear the energy, Sophie recommends lighting Palo Santo and sage around the space.\n\nBefore beginning the actual 'ceremony', Sophie said to spend a few minutes meditating, working on your breathing and clearing your mind.\n\nWhat do you need for an 'energetic cord-cutting ceremony'? Palo Santo/sage\n\nA calm state of mind\n\nA peaceful, grounding space\n\nIntention\n\nOptional: Thread or rope, a photograph\n\n'This kind of ceremony should be done after you've accepted that this relationship is no longer serving your highest potential and you've taken the steps to clear away mental space holding onto this bond,' she advised.\n\n'Come to this ceremony with a calm mindset and strong intentions.\n\n'Maybe this is the first thing in the morning or before you want to go to bed, but you want to find a place where you won't be disrupted.'\n\nThe ceremony itself involves visualizing a literal cord between you and the person you are trying to let go of.\n\nCalm: Sophie, pictured, advised people to only carry out the cord-cutting when they feel at peace\n\nYou should imagine yourself severing this cord, only after telling the other person you are 'grateful', but you can no longer be tied to them.\n\nIf it's too hard to simply visualize this connection, Sophie recommended using an actual piece of thread or rope and a photo of the other person at the end.\n\nTo really end the tie, you can even burn the thread with a candle or use a scissors to cut the middle.\n\nLastly, she wants you to 'send gratitude' to the relationship before figuratively or literally disposing of the cord.\n\nAnd after, you should bring 'love back into the body' by doing some kind of mindful movement you enjoy such as dancing or yoga.\n\nMovement: Post-ceremony, the yoga teacher advised to complete some kind of joyful movement (like dancing) to 'bring love back into the body'\n\nWhile the tried-and-tested post-breakup move might involve just dumping your ex's items in the trash, Sophie said that it's important to get to the root of the connection in order to really move on.\n\n'Tossing your ex's items, deleting contact, hitting that mute button on Instagram or unfriending is definitely an important aspect in closing off that relationship, but in order to completely let go from the bond created you have to go deeper.\n\n'Cord-cutting releases the energetic cords and deeper bonds created in a relationship. It's the deep internal healing work that fully allows you to bring closure and control back to yourself.\n\nThe cord-cutting ceremony originally came about two years ago when Sophie wanted to find a way to 'drop the BS within her own family' and create a new beginning.\n\n'I started with a tangible thing in my head - an actual rope or cord or string - and went from there,' she said.\n\n'I was leading moon circles often, and I've been doing a lot of energetic work personally on old relationships that don't serve my current reality anymore. I wanted to combine the work of both worlds. And that's where the idea for this ceremony came to fruition.'", "description": "A Los Angeles-based spiritual guru and yoga teacher recommended a simple, straight forward process for healing and moving on after the demise of a romantic or familial relationship.", "authors": ["Freya Drohan For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/16/19403040-0-image-a-177_1570462733384.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
