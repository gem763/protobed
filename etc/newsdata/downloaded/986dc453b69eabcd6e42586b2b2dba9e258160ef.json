It has since dropped its presenter-led format, and the 15-minute show is now narrated by Tina Daheley.\n\nMs Ahmed is due to give evidence at the Central London Employment Tribunal hearing this afternoon.\n\nMs Ahmed has taken the BBC to an employment tribunal and has been backed by fellow stars, including the Reverend Richard Coles and Katie Puckrick, former presenter of The Word\n\nShe has received support from a number of fellow BBC presenters, including Radio 4 Woman's Hour's Jane Garvey and Richard Coles, who joined her as she walked into the building on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday evening, Ms Ahmed said: 'I love my job on Newswatch despite it being difficult and challenging.\n\n'On the back of my BBC ID card are written the BBC values which include 'we respect each other and celebrate our diversity' and 'we take pride in delivering quality and value for money'.\n\n'I just ask why the BBC thinks I am worth only a sixth of the value of the work of a man for doing a very similar job.'\n\nThe presenter previously secured an agreement with the BBC to receive full backdated pay with her male counterparts for her work on Radio 4's Front Row and Night Waves on Radio 3.\n\nMs Ahmed presents Newswatch, in which viewers can complain about BBC reporting\n\nIn a statement, a BBC spokesman said: 'The BBC is committed to equal pay. Points Of View is an entertainment programme with a long history and is a household name with the public. Newswatch - while an important programme - isn't.\n\n'Samira was paid the same as her male predecessor when she began presenting Newswatch.\n\n'Gender has not been a factor in levels of pay for Points Of View. News and entertainment are very different markets and pay across the media industry reflects this.'\n\nA statement from BBC Women said: 'We know that this is a case Samira did not want to bring. BBC managers had every opportunity to pay her equally for equal work in line with the law. We stand with Samira as she stands with so many of us facing similar battles.'", "description": "Ms Ahmed, who fronts Newswatch, has taken the BBC to an employment tribunal, claiming that she was paid 'a sixth' of what Vine earned while he was presenting Points Of View.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/13/20375776-0-image-a-111_1572440877078.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
