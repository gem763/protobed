Show a little more compassion for someone who is hurting. Think about someone\u2019s feelings and just chill.\u2019\n\nCheika had already given a dejected interview to the official broadcaster pitchside after the defeat and dropped the F-bomb when talking about letting down the fans who had travelled out to Japan.\n\n\ud83d\udde3 \"The better team won.

That\u2019s the way we play footy,\u2019 Cheika added. \u2018We\u2019re not going to go to a kick and defend game. We\u2019d rather win our way or no way. That\u2019s the way Aussies want us to play.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Australia coach Michael Cheika asked reporters to 'think about his feelings' during his post-match press conference after England knocked them out of the Rugby World Cup.
