His legacy.\u2019\n\nMr Seiger accused the US government of twisting the laws\u2019 on diplomat immunity.\n\nHe added: \u2018The Trump administration is not only hell bent on breaking international laws, rules and conventions on diplomatic immunity, but they have no care or concern for the welfare of Harry\u2019s family or any real intent on finding a solution.\n\nHarry Dunn died when his motorbike crashed into a car outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018President Trump told mum Charlotte at the meeting that we would look to approach the problem from a different angle, but the family have heard no further and have no faith in his words.\u2019\n\nThe family have already started a case against the UK Foreign Office over the decision to grant Mrs Sacoolas immunity.\n\nBritish police confirmed last week that they would interview Mrs Sacoolas under caution in the US after she requested to be interviewed there by Northamptonshire Police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey say she had \u2018cooperated fully\u2019 and had spoken to them at the scene after the crash and the next day at her home.\n\nMrs Sacoolas previously said through her lawyer that she was \u2018devastated by this tragic accident\u2019 but Harry\u2019s mother, Charlotte Charles, rejected the apology, saying \u2018sorry doesn\u2019t cut it\u2019.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
