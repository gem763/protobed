The SFFA argued the process holds Asian American students to a higher standard than others. Asians make up about 5.6% percent of the U.S. population and made up 22.2% of Harvard\u2019s admitted undergraduate class in 2017.\n\nThe Harvard lawsuit sparked a nationwide debate about affirmative action in colleges. In August 2018, the Justice Department said that Harvard failed to demonstrate that it does not discriminate on the basis of race in its admissions policy.\n\nHarvard did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but it has denied SFFA\u2019s allegations in the past.\n\nConservative strategist and SFFA President Edward Blum told HuffPost that the organization is \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the ruling and believes the information SFFA provided at trial \u201ccompellingly revealed Harvard\u2019s systematic discrimination against Asian-American applicants.\u201d\n\nBlum said SFFA will appeal the ruling, which could result in the case going up to the Supreme Court. The high court allows higher education institutions to consider race in admissions, but it says the decision must be made in a way to specifically promote diversity and should be implemented for a limited time.\n\nBlum was also behind an anti-affirmative action lawsuit against the University of Texas at Austin. The Supreme Court ruled in the university\u2019s favor in the lawsuit in 2016.\n\nWith Harvard\u2019s current admissions process, students will be able to \u201cknow and understand one another beyond race, as whole individuals with unique histories and experiences,\u201d the judge ruled Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt is this, at Harvard and elsewhere that will move us, one day, to the point where we see that race is a fact, but not the defining fact and not the fact that tells us what is important, but we are not there yet,\u201d Burroughs said. \u201cUntil we are, race-conscious admissions programs that survive strict scrutiny will have an important place in society and help ensure that colleges and universities can offer a diverse atmosphere that fosters learning, improves scholarship, and encourages mutual respect and understanding.\u201d", "description": "The judge ruled in the university's favor in a lawsuit alleging the school is biased against Asian Americans by considering race in its admissions process.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d93b8772100003300513397.jpeg?cache=ipeylwdltz&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
