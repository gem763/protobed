Staff at several hospitals in the Salt Lake City area would eventually report an \"influx\" of women from the Marshall Islands giving birth and putting their babies up for adoption, often accompanied by the same woman.\n\nIn Arizona, Peterson was indicted on 32 charges including theft, fraud and forgery. Prosecutors there say the scheme defrauded Arizona's Medicaid system of $800,000 because the women had no intention of remaining in the state when they applied for benefits.\n\nThe Arizona Department of Public Safety (DPS) said it received a tip in December of 2018 from a person who had been interested in adopting through Peterson's firm but became suspicious of his practices, court documents state.\n\nProsecutors say Petersen used associates in the Marshall Islands, where he had served a two-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to recruit pregnant women by offering many of them $10,000 each to give up their babies for adoption. Petersen would pay for the women to travel to the U.S. days or months before giving birth and live in a home that he owned until delivering the baby, according to the court records.\n\nPetersen charged families $25,000-$40,000 per adoption and brought about $2.7 million into a bank account for adoption fees in less than two years, according to court documents.\n\nUnder a compact between the United States and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Marshallese citizens can enter the U.S. and work without a visa, unless they're traveling for the purpose of adoption, authorities said.\n\nSeparately, federal prosecutors in Arkansas announced that Peterson had been arrested Wednesday and unsealed an indictment charging him with crimes including conspiracy, mail fraud, and wire fraud.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Arizona Department of Public Safety, Homeland Security Investigations and the Utah Attorney General's Office were involved in the arrest, officials said.\n\nAuthorities in all three states said that the birth mothers and the adoptive families did not commit any crimes and would not be facing charges. No completed adoptions will be undone because authorities do not believe the women were misled into believing their children might be returned at some point.\n\nPetersen is being held on a $500,000 bond and is due in court on Oct. 15.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "An Arizona elected official\u00a0is facing dozens of charges in three states in connection with\u00a0a multimillion-dollar adoption\u00a0scheme in which\u00a0he allegedly smuggled more than\u00a040 women into the U.S. from the Marshall Islands, promising them money in exchange for their babies.", "authors": ["Vandana Rambaran", "Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News", "Politics At Foxnews.Com.
