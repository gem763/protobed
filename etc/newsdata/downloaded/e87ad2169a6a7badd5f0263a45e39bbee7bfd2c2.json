Now Desmond Morris has been watching politicians, concluding that they are a breed apart, with a body language that speaks volumes.\n\nHe told The Telegraph that politics has become such a \u201cpantomime\u201d, that the best way to watch televised debates is with the mute button pressed: \u201cThen you\u2019ll see much more clearly what the politicians are really like. You can learn so much from their body language.\u201d\n\nWhile he describes US President Donald Trump as \u201ca master of domineering body language\u201d and says that Prime Minister Boris Johnson \u201csuper-exaggerates\u201d gesticulations to convey \u201cenergy\u201d, he is struck that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has \u201cvirtually no body language\u201d.\n\nIn studying President Trump, he has observed \u201ca whole range of tricks, which are so well done\u201d, not least his one-upmanship in shaking hands in a \u201cvery special way\u201d.\n\nHe explained that hand-shaking was not popular until the 19th century \u201cbecause it\u2019s essentially egalitarian\u201d: \u201cIf you\u2019re shaking hands with the king,... you are performing identical actions and, just for that split second, you are equal to the king\u2026 When President Trump meets another world leader and they shake hands, you might think that - because they\u2019re both world leaders - they would do the same movement. But, if you study his handshakes, you find that, in several ways, he manages to make himself superior.", "description": "He is a zoologist and animal behaviourist who transformed the way we look at human beings with his landmark bestselling books The Naked Ape and Manwatching.", "authors": ["Dalya Alberge", "Zoe Strimpel", "David Trimble", "Roderick Crawford", "Stephen Barclay", "Daniel Hannan", "Matt Kilcoyne", "Janet Daley", "Juliet Samuel", "Michael Deacon"], "top_image": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/1z4r1sgNrvk/mqdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
