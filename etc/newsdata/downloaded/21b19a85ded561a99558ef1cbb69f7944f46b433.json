At the time, Trump was withholding military aid that had been approved by Congress for Ukraine.", "description": "Trump's comment came hours after federal prosecutors revealed that two of Giuliani's clients, along with two other men, had been charged with conspiring to violate campaign finance laws.", "authors": ["Dan Mangan"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105178636-GettyImages-624664028.jpg?v=1570740828", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
