Gen. Ed Thomas said in a statement. \"In this case, they made reservations through the Defense Travel System and used the closest available and least expensive accommodations to the airfield within the crews' allowable hotel rates. While we are still reviewing the trip records, we have found nothing that falls outside the guidelines associated with selecting stopover airports on travel routes and hotel accommodations for crew rest.\"\n\nThe Air Force said the crew on the March 13 consisted of seven active duty and National Guard crew members, adding that although they stayed at Turnberry en route to Kuwait, \"it doesn't appear\" they did so on the trip back to the US.\n\nThe Air Force said the Turnberry resort was less expensive than a nearby Marriott and that both were under the per diem rate of $166. The Air Force also said it schedules stopovers based on such factors as leg distance and contract fuel availability.", "description": "The crew of a US Air Force C-17 stayed at President Donald Trump's golf resort in Turnberry, Scotland, during a March refueling stop en route to Kuwait, the Air Force acknowledged, again raising ethics questions about government use of the President's private entities.", "authors": ["Ryan Browne", "Kevin Bohn"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180510112902-trump-turnberry-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
