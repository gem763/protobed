It\u2019s an investigation in search of a crime.\u201d\n\nHe said his administration is \u201cworking to put an end, for everybody, to horrible injustice and horrible practices that we\u2019ve seen, not only here.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in some pretty high places,\u201d the president said. \u201cJustice, fairness and due process are core tenets of our democracy, these are timeless principles I will faithfully uphold as president. They\u2019re principles Republicans stand for, and historically Democrats have stood for in the past. They used to stand for them.\u201d\n\nThe president has criticized House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry for denying him the right to representation in the closed room at the Capitol where lawmakers are questioning witnesses.\n\nMr. Trump told the crowd in South Carolina, \u201cI will always fight against abuses of power from any source, and I will always champion the right to due process, the right to a fair trial. the right to good legal representation, for every American, regardless of race, background, position.\u201d\n\nThe president visited the forum at Benedict College in Columbia to tout his administration\u2019s achievements in criminal justice reform. He cited this year\u2019s First Step Act as a milestone that has enabled the release of thousands of non-violent prisoners who were languishing in jail on lengthy sentences, and he shared the stage with three black former prisoners whom he pardoned or who gained their release through the new law.\n\nMr. Trump acknowledged that criminal justice reform \u201cwas not a theme of my campaign initially.\u201d He said he listened to faith leaders, political leaders and his son-in-law, adviser Jared Kushner, whose father served a federal prison term for tax evasion and other charges.\n\n\u201cThey all came to see me, to ask me to fight on behalf of this forgotten community,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI knew criminal justice reform was not about politics. To this day, I\u2019m not sure that what I did was a popular thing or an unpopular thing, but I know it was the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also used the trip to appeal for black voters\u2019 support in 2020, saying the Democratic Party has abandoned them. He pointed to historic low levels of black unemployment and black poverty under his administration.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic policies have let African-Americans down and taken them for granted,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had so many people with empty political rhetoric. For over 100 years, it\u2019s been all talk by a certain group of politicians, and no action. And I promise you that Republicans will never, ever do that.\u201d\n\nHe said of his administration, \u201cWe\u2019re acting, not talking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep fighting for you and we\u2019re fighting hard and we\u2019re really having an impact,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re having an impact on elections now.\u201d\n\nThere were some chants of \u201cfour more years\u201d in the audience, which was a mixture of black and white attendees.\n\nThe president said Washington has squandered money in recent decades on foreign wars, instead of spending it on black communities.\n\n\u201cOur leaders spent $8 trillion dollars on wars in the Middle East, but they allowed our great cities to fall into tragic decay and disrepair,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cFor the cost of one year of war in the Middle East, we could have given scholarships to every child at every inner city school in America and had tremendous numbers of dollars left over.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cPoliticians drained America\u2019s wealth policing ancient tribal conflicts overseas, while leaving generations of African-American children trapped in failing government schools and in failing inner cities.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany politicians in Congress fight harder for illegal immigrants than they do for United States\u2019 citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder this administration, the great betrayal of the American worker is over.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
