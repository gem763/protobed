REUTERS/Zoubeir Souissi\n\nFor his opponent Kais Saied, the journey would be very different: through poor districts where the 2011 revolution flared and where the cafes are filled with unemployed young men.\n\nThe stark contrast between their neighborhoods - Karoui\u2019s opulent Carthage and Saied\u2019s earthier Mnihla - underscores the many other differences between the candidates in both their politics and temperament.\n\nSupporters of Karoui, a self-assured businessman facing corruption charges, present Sunday\u2019s run-off presidential vote as a choice between a professionally successful, secular champion of Tunisia\u2019s poor and an inexperienced conservative backed by Islamists.\n\nBackers of Saied, an awkward law professor who has barely campaigned in the race, see it as pitting a humble, principled representative of the 2011 revolution that brought democracy to the country against a glib, corrupt avatar of Tunisia\u2019s unchanging moneyed elite.\n\nAlthough the president has fewer powers than a prime minister the post is still Tunisia\u2019s most senior directly elected official with wide political influence. The prime minister will be picked by the parliament that was elected last Sunday.\n\nNo polls have been published since before the election period, but Saied took 18.4% of votes in last month\u2019s first round and Karoui 15.6%.\n\nBoth men have presented themselves as political outsiders riding a wave of public dissatisfaction with the years of economic stagnation that followed the 2011 revolution, a rising that inspired the \u201cArab spring\u201d.\n\nOn Friday night, weeks after Karoui and Saied took the top two places in the first round vote, Tunisians will see them debate face-to-face for the first time.\n\nThe reason they have not met on the hustings already is that Karoui was in detention since August awaiting a verdict in his trial for tax evasion and money laundering, accusations he denies.\n\nWith democracy watchdogs raising concerns about the credibility of Sunday\u2019s election, a court released Karoui on Wednesday evening, allowing him to leave prison before a crowd of cheering supporters.\n\nCHAMPIONING THE POOR\n\nKaroui\u2019s legal troubles have reinforced the perception among his critics that he is a self-serving opportunist, and among his supporters that he is the victim of political machinations by influential rivals.\n\nHe made his fortune through a communications company he set up with his brother during the reign of Tunisia\u2019s autocratic former president Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, who died in exile in Saudi Arabia last month.\n\nRecently, his unlicensed Nessma TV station has broadcast constant footage advertising Karoui\u2019s philanthropy in the poorest districts of Tunisia.\n\nYet Karoui makes no bones about his wealth, and his formula for improving the lives of the poor involves boosting business - something that goes down well with the rich.\n\nIn the cypress-lined streets around his home, boasting foreign embassies, government palaces and ancient Roman sites, and with the Mediterranean glittering in the background, few people backed Saied.\n\n\u201cIn the first round all the people here voted for Nabil Karoui and they will vote for him again on Sunday to keep their interests,\u201d said Nabila Nabli, a local resident who works as governess to a French family.\n\nYet Karoui also has great support in some of Tunisia\u2019s poorest areas. In the parliamentary elections last Sunday, his party came first in the deprived northwestern hills near the Algerian border.\n\nWhen Reuters visited that area before the first round of the presidential election, many people felt utterly disconnected from politics or the elections, but many had heard of Karoui after watching Nessma TV and its broadcasts showing him helping the poor.\n\nOPPOSING CORRUPTION\n\nSaied has the support of Ennahda, the moderate Islamist party that came out on top in the parliamentary vote last week, as well as some secular, leftwing groups.\n\nSaied has voiced some conservative social views against homosexuality and equal inheritance for men and women, but has mostly kept quiet on policy issues.\n\nHis professed focus is on installing a form of direct democracy, but he also wants to stop the influence of foreign money in Tunisia and see a bigger state role in the economy.\n\nFor many, his appeal lies in his personality. He spent no cash on his campaign, preferring to simply talk to people in cafes. His formal personal manner has bolstered his image as a man ready to root out corruption, cronyism and privilege.\n\nIn his Mnihla district on the outskirts of Tunis, he lives in a large house in a new, middle-class development closely surrounded by much poorer areas.\n\nAt the Barakette cafe opposite the mosque he attends, the barman said Saied\u2019s habits matched his public image. \u201cHe is very correct and exact. He comes every day at exactly the same time, takes his coffee, gives the exact change,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the fruit stand nearby, Adil Zidi, 29, took a moment from spooning out cactus fruit for a customer to say why he planned to vote for Saied.\n\n\u201cFor us as frustrated youth, we\u2019ll vote for any newcomer like him to get rid of the old system... he\u2019s a correct, serious person who can apply the law without distinction,\u201d he said.", "description": "If he wins Sunday's election, media mogul Nabil Karoui will only have to stroll up one of Tunisia's most expensive streets to move from his own home into the presidential palace.", "authors": ["Angus Mcdowall", "Tarek Amara", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439654992&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0XH-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
