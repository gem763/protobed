Indigenous groups, students and unions joined the protest, blocking roads with rocks and burning tires.\n\nIn Quito, masked demonstrators threw stones at riot police who responded with tear gas and deployed armored vehicles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an indefinite action until the government overturns the decree on subsidies. We\u2019re paralyzing the nation,\u201d one bus transport leader, Abel G\u00f3mez, told Reuters.\n\nOfficials say the elimination of fuel subsidies was necessary to lift the economy and stop smuggling.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Scenes in the capital, Quito, on Thursday.

Street protests toppled three presidents during economic turmoil in the decade before Correa took office in 2007.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A demonstrator is detained by the police in Quito.

But skepticism of the IMF runs strong in Ecuador and throughout Latin America, where many blame austerity policies for economic hardship.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll close all the main roads,\u201d said taxi driver Sergio Menoscal, 55, helping to block streets in Guayaquil.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired of false promises ... we can\u2019t be blind to a government that has done nothing for the people.\u201d", "description": "Fiscal reform package sends demonstrators to the streets: \u2018We\u2019re paralyzing the nation\u2019", "authors": ["Reuters In Quito"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b5e61e0e5fab09cc87f9725530484231469642/0_0_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0a1309b55d8c93a946a31803f5cd7811"}
