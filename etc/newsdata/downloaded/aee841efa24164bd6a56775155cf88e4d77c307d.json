The report also said that eight members of the security forces had been killed and 1,287 others wounded. The overwhelming majority of the protesters were unarmed.\n\nThe punitive action taken by Adel Abdul Mahdi, Iraq\u2019s prime minister, was the sharpest rebuke of military excess at any time in recent years, and its language was strikingly clear and strong. It nevertheless drew broad criticism from Iraqis across the political spectrum, mixed in with some praise.\n\nThe sharpest words came from those disappointed that the government had failed both to take responsibility for its part in the bloodshed and to hold to account the popular mobilization units, some backed by Iran, known as Hasht al-Shabi. Security units linked to the groups were believed to be responsible for some of the most deadly excesses.", "description": "The government said it would hold a dozen commanders accountable after their forces fired on civilian protesters, leaving more than 100 dead.", "authors": ["Alissa J.
