Let everyone enjoy the game. Say no to racism.'\n\nAlong with their chanting, Bulgaria fans were also seen making Nazi salutes and offensive gestures in the crowd.\n\nFollowing the second public address one particular group of supporters were seen exiting the stadium - which was already partially closed as punishment for a previous abuse offence - and for Ince, anything other than lifetime bans for those found guilty 'is b***cks'.\n\nFA chairman Greg Clarke revealed that England players and backroom staff are providing witness statements so that UEFA and Bulgarian police can conduct a full investigation into the racist incidents at the match.\n\n'There has to be a stronger deterrent,' Ince added. 'It can't just be about fining them \u00a350,000 or \u00a3100,000 that's not a deterrent for me.\n\n'The only way UEFA can do that with these teams is getting them punished from European competitions. I don't think fines will be enough.'\n\nEngland regrouped at half time and decided to come out and play the second half of the game\n\nBREAKDOWN OF EVENTS IN ENGLAND'S 6-0 WIN IN BULGARIA The game was halted TWICE as home fans abuse black players, brandish 'No Respect' shirts and make Nazi salutes in planned racist onslaught\n\nTyrone Mings reveals vile chants started before kick-off in Bulgaria\n\nMarcus Rashford praises 'courage' of Bulgaria captain Ivelin Popov for appealing to fans at half-time to stop racist taunting of England players\n\nEngland boss Gareth Southgate considered taking his players off the pitch against Bulgaria as FA chairman Greg Clarke condemns racist taunting\n\nBulgaria boss Krasimir Balakov claimed not to have heard any chanting and said in his post-match press conference: 'The unacceptable behaviour was by England fans.'\n\nIan Wright says England players taking action against racism made him 'feel really good'\n\nRaheem Sterling calls out Bulgaria coach Krasimir Balakov for saying England have a bigger racism problem than his own country and posts funny Ainsley Harriott meme in response to Piers Morgan hailing his performance in face of vile racist abuse\n\nUEFA will use evidence from specialist 'spotters' in the crowd and TV footage to prosecute after Bulgarian fans' appalling racist taunts\n\nBulgaria's prime minister has called on the president of their FA to quit over the racist incidents\n\nSouthgate's side continued through until the final whistle despite the ongoing jeers and noises, completely outclassing their opponents to secure passage through to Euro 2020.\n\nThe subsequent reaction has seen the prime minister of Bulgaria demand that the country's FA president steps down over the shocking racist treatment that England's black players were subjected to.\n\nBulgarian PM Boyko Borisov says the government will freeze all relations with the Bulgarian FA - including denying them any funding - until Mihaylov steps down.\n\nFor Ince, Bulgaria boss Krasimir Balakov, who he faced in his playing days, must be sacked for his post-match comments and his touchline demeanour, which appeared to suggest England and their supporters were prone to exaggeration.\n\n'I was more disappointed with the Bulgaria manager Balakov,' he said. 'His quotes after the game were disgraceful and this is someone I played against back in the day, he was a fantastic player but to hear his quotes and what he was saying, it was like he was backing the people who were doing it.\n\n'Saying he didn't hear it... well, everyone else in the stadium heard it so how could you not hear? He tried to turn the tables on England fans which, for me, someone like that shouldn't be managing.\n\n'If I had anything to do with it he wouldn't be managing Bulgaria with the comments he came out with.\n\nInce said he would sack Bulgaria boss Krasimir Balakov over dismissive comments on abuse\n\nPaul Ince is a Paddy Power ambassador.
