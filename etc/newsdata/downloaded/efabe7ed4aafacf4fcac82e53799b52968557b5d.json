Lately though it has done much better, ranking 3rd over the past 10 and 20 years,\u201d he said (see table below).\n\nSource: LPL\n\nDetrick also noted that poor equity performance in an October that has preceded an election year has been skewed by the historic 1987 crash.\n\n\u201cPre-election years, though, it ranks 11th, but this is mainly due to losing nearly 22% in 1987 \u2014 so that skews things,\u201d he said.\n\nSource: LPL\n\nNow, for small-capitalization stocks, the narrative has been unequivocally bone-chilling. As measured by the Russell 2000 index RUT, +0.19%, small-caps have averaged a decline of 1.08% in October and the month is its worst \u2014 hands down, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Russell 2000 finishes lower in October 47% of the time (see table below):\n\nSource: Dow Jones Market Data\n\nThat being said, perhaps the Russell 2000 can buck that trend after coming off a gain of more than 2.3% in September. Last year, the small-cap benchmark put in its worst decline since 2008, tumbling 10.91%.\n\nHowever, markets have been wrestling with an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, a trade scuffle between the U.S. and China, and a regime of monetary easing across the globe in the face of worldwide economic weakness. A downturn for the once-hot market for initial public offerings, with WeWork-parent The We Co. WE, +0.00% shelving its plans for blockbuster public listings in the face of deteriorating appetite, also has hurt market sentiment.\n\nPerhaps with all those issues swirling in plain sight, stock investors have fewer chances for a big surprise and equity benchmarks can manage to scare up further gains in October.", "description": "September has shaped up to be an upbeat month for the stock market despite a number of scares, including an impeachment inquiry and a rip-roaring IPO market...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FX314_hallow_ZG_20171031064752.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
