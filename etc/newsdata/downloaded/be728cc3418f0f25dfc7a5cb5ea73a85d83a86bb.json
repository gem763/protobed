In contrast, considerably more than a trillion dollars are traded daily in the market for repurchase agreements, where financial institutions swap Treasury securities for cash.\n\n\u201cFed funds is a moribund market,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. interest rates at Bank of America Corp. \u201cIt does not really represent where banks are truly seeking to lend and borrow.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s led to calls that the Fed change its framework for carrying out monetary policy. The aim: Lessen the chances of the sort of turmoil that saw repurchase or repo rates soar as high as 10% last week and strengthen the central bank\u2019s control of the short-term money markets that underpin the financial system and the economy.\n\nThe most radical step the Fed could take -- and probably the one that\u2019s least likely at this point -- would be to junk the fed funds target entirely and replace it with an objective for an economically more significant short-term rate.\n\nAmong the possible candidates to replace fed funds: The recently minted secured overnight financing rate, a broad daily repo rate measure that the Fed is championing as a new benchmark for contracts on everything from home mortgages to corporate loans. One downside is that, being linked to repo, it too was subject to major spikes during the recent tumult.\n\nA more subtle, yet still potentially significant change that the central bank could make would be to tweak the rules of engagement under which the New York Fed\u2019s Open Market Desk operates in the money market. Instead of being tasked to merely keep the federal funds rate within its target range, the desk could be given greater leeway to respond to pressures elsewhere in the money markets.\n\nWhile some analysts say the desk may be indirectly doing that already, a more explicit mandate would reassure traders that the Fed is ready to respond promptly to market dislocations even when the funds rate is within its target range.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Sept. 18, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell played down the significance of recent market strains, though he acknowledged that they had been worse than expected.\n\n\u201cWhile these issues are important for market functioning and market participants, they have no implications for the economy or the stance of monetary policy,\u201d he said.\n\nBefore the 2008-09 financial crisis, it made sense for the Fed to target the federal funds rate because that was the market banks used to lend and borrow scarce reserves from each other, with hundreds of billions of dollars changing hands each day.\n\nThe market\u2019s dynamics changed, however, when quantitative-easing measures intended to safeguard the economy created vast new bank reserves, lessening the need for institutions to tap interbank liquidity. While some of those reserves have since been extinguished, there are still far more than there were pre-crisis.\n\nThat\u2019s left the Federal Home Loan Banks -- a group of government-sponsored lenders -- as the dominant players in the fed funds market, unintentionally giving them outsized influence over where the rate settles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too specialized and too small a market,\u201d said Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed official who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cYou want a bigger market\u201d to use for a target.\n\nFed policy makers discussed alternatives to the funds target at their policy making meeting last November. One that got a lot of air time: The overnight bank funding rate.\n\nPublished by the New York Fed, the unsecured benchmark adds eurodollar transactions -- which are largely banks borrowing from non-bank financial institutions, like money-market mutual funds -- and certain domestic deposits to the volume of daily fed funds transactions.\n\nWhereas fed funds breached the Fed\u2019s target range last week, the overnight bank funding rate peaked at 2.25% before retreating.\n\nWhile OBFR volume is roughly double that of fed funds alone, it is still just a fraction of that in the repurchase market. And it also has been trending lower in recent years.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Recent turbulence in U.S. money markets has cast light on a big problem hidden at the root of the Federal Reserve\u2019s conduct of monetary policy: It is targeting an increasingly irrelevant interest rate.Less than $100 billion changes hands each day in the federal funds market, the overnight", "authors": ["Rich Miller"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ru5.9a8LjCdvo15hb7ajHg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/882572a769e1c3bc12da15d3399ac7e3", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
