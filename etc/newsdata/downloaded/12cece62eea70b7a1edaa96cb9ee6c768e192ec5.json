Intense rainfall in many parts of the country has triggered floods that have swamped cane and rice fields and caused deaths in some cases.\n\nOn Thursday, at least 11 people died and six were reported missing after the western Indian city of Pune and surroundings were hit by flash floods.", "description": "Dozens die due to heavy rains in India's Uttar Pradesh", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_6_800x533_L_1412601562.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
