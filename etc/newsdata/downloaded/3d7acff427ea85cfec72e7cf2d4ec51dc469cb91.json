His crowds are warm, but rarely high-energy. His organization is solid, but doesn\u2019t always show up in force at key events that help shape the perceptions of political power brokers.\n\nBiden\u2019s team insists such optics are overrated as indicators of a candidate\u2019s strength. The former vice president, they argue, is unique in the Democratic field because of a reservoir of goodwill from a broad group of supporters who know him so well they don\u2019t necessarily need to see him campaign or otherwise demonstrate their support in public.\n\n\u201cI think people can be fooled by the crowd size,\u201d said Terry Shumaker, a staunch Biden supporter in New Hampshire. Shrugging off \u201clots of noise for some candidates,\u201d Shumaker compared Biden\u2019s support to an iceberg, where only one-seventh is visible.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": ""}
