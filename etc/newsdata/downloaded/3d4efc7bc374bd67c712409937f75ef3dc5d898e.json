A few minutes in, he explained he wasn\u2019t sure about the procedure and, anyway, didn\u2019t have the right equipment. It was a visit wasted.\n\nAs I slouched grumpily into the kitchen, he took another look at me. Perhaps my cross face reminded him of how I look on television, and I could see the penny drop. \u2018Are you that Susanna Reid?\u2019 he asked, eyes widening. And then the inevitable: \u2018Can I get a selfie?\u2019\n\nTricky. Actress Emma Thompson was criticised for turning down a photo with a waiter in a restaurant at the weekend, but letting a stranger take photos of me, in my house, felt weird.\n\nI said no. There were, hopefully, no hard feelings. I didn\u2019t think he had been unprofessional. He didn\u2019t seem to think I\u2019d been rude and we ended up chatting and laughing, which felt more normal.\n\nSusanna Reid (pictured) discussed the appropriate time to ask a celebrity for a photograph, following her encounter with an engineer called to her house\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I would never say no at a red-carpet event. It\u2019s part of the job. Without the viewers we are nothing, so a simple picture is hardly too much to ask. The only awkwardness is looking into a crowd of expectant faces and realising they have no intention of asking me for a photo \u2014 because they are all waiting for Amanda Holden or Holly Willoughby behind me.\n\nBut at home, or when I\u2019m with my kids, it\u2019s different. It feels . . . odd. That\u2019s why I used to say no if I was asked for selfies while out with my children when they were young. They\u2019d be shopping with me \u2014 their mum \u2014 and all of a sudden someone would be treating me as if I was special.\n\nI could see the look on the kids\u2019 faces as the picture was taken. I went from \u2018Mummy\u2019 to \u2018the lady off the telly\u2019 and it took a few uncomfortable minutes for us all not to feel weird about it.\n\nIt makes me laugh if someone requests a selfie, then asks: \u2018Who are you again?\u2019 They just vaguely know they know you from somewhere. It strikes me that the selfie transaction can be quite one-sided, as people often don\u2019t speak to you and just wave their phone hopefully in your face.\n\nIt\u2019s far worse for those who are really in demand. Last summer, I sat at a dinner table with sprint legend Usain Bolt and I suspect he wasn\u2019t able to eat a morsel of food all evening, so long was the queue of people asking him for a picture. It was a charity event, so he graciously said yes to every one. \u2018I know you must be fed up with this,\u2019 each person began, \u2018but can I just get a picture?\u2019\n\nYes, I\u2019d have loved a cheeky snap with him, too. But the poor chap needed a minute\u2019s break.\n\nI did once ambush Tom Cruise at the London premiere of his film Edge Of Tomorrow, though. He is famous for enthusiastically doing pictures with fans, so I grabbed one with him live on GMB. Oh yes, and the resulting snap ended up on the front of this newspaper with the label \u2018Susanna\u2019s toe-curling selfie\u2019!\n\nSusanna (pictured in a 'toe-curling\u2019 selfie with Tom Cruise) says Emma Thompson was right to say no to a waiter asking for a selfie in a restaurant at the weekend\n\nBut there have to be limits. Emma Thompson was right to say no to that hotel restaurant selfie, rather than impose on her guests and spoil the atmosphere at their smart dinner. She was off duty and the waiter was supposed to be working, so it was against the rules for him to ask. (He was promptly suspended \u2014 a bit over the top, surely \u2014 and she is now fighting for him to be reinstated.)\n\nFor a fan, a selfie takes just a moment and those who dare to ask, win. But for the celeb, the seconds can add up to never having a moment to themselves.\n\nI\u2019m lucky that when I\u2019m not doing my job, but am out at the supermarket in jeans and a jumper, I am rarely stopped. Without the presenter\u2019s warpaint I couldn\u2019t look more different from the \u2018lady off the telly\u2019 \u2014 I\u2019m just my normal self.\n\nAnd nobody wants a selfie with that Susanna Reid.\n\nThe real reason Boris can\u2019t get his deal through\n\nOn the date Brexit was supposed to have happened but didn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t surprise me to find the astrology world warning us that Mercury goes into retrograde today.\n\nOur zombie Parliament has repeatedly failed to deliver any certainty, opinion polls and experts keep getting it wrong, so I\u2019m seizing on anything that might offer a clue.\n\nMercury retrograde periods are \u2018notorious for causing tech failures, major miscommunications, confusion, unclear plans, scheduling mishaps, travel snags and more,\u2019 according to astrology expert Nina Kahn. Sounds like another warning from Project Fear.\n\nSusanna claims injuries always occur on Strictly around Halloween, Will Bayley (pictured) was forced to leave the show after damaging his knee\n\nHalloween is prime time for injuries \u2014 and I should know\n\nInjuries strike around the Halloween episode of Strictly every year. By this stage in the season, ambitions are keener, bodies fitter and everyone feels they can push harder. Unfortunately, people get hurt.\n\nPoor Will Bayley jumped from a table and his knee ended up so damaged, he\u2019s had to leave the show.\n\nI got injured ahead of the Halloween show myself when I took part \u2014 an ambitious lift put my back into spasm. I desperately wanted to do the lifts, which are even harder than they look: it isn\u2019t all about the man doing the lifting, the woman has to lean into it to make it work. The pain was so bad I could barely move.\n\nFellow contestant Abbey Clancy saved the day: by coincidence, the Leicester City football team were staying at our hotel. Abbey, whose husband is footballer Peter Crouch, just sidled up to their physio and asked him to fix my damaged spine. A few painful cracks later, I felt transformed.\n\nWhat a pity Abbey and Peter couldn\u2019t come to Will Bayley\u2019s rescue, too.\n\nSusanna has prepared for this year's trick-or-treaters with this spooky flower arrangement\n\nMy Spooky treat\n\nI always have a beautiful wreath of berries at Christmas, but had never thought about putting one on the door at Halloween. Then I spotted this spooky arrangement of fake flowers, sparkling orange skulls and black net ribbons. It\u2019s a lot less effort than carving a pumpkin and will last for years. Now I\u2019m all set to welcome the trick-or-treaters with a bowl of sweets tonight.\n\nHalloween Floral Door Wreath, \u00a312, argos.co.uk", "description": "Susanna Reid who recently refused to take a photograph with an engineer called to her home, discussed the appropriate time to ask a celebrity for a selfie.", "authors": ["Susanna Reid For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/22/20398890-0-image-a-2_1572473199208.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
