(Laura Cooper/Nelson County Farm Bureau/AP)\n\nA yak named Meteor that gained Internet acclaim after escaping its owner en route to a butcher earlier this month in central Virginia has died after being struck by a vehicle, authorities said Friday.\n\nOn Sept. 10, Meteor\u2019s owner told Nelson County animal control officials the yak kicked off the back door of a livestock trailer at a stop sign in Lovingston, about 40 miles southwest of Charlottesville.\n\n[A yak named Meteor escaped on the way to the butcher in Virginia]\n\nDespite the efforts of law enforcement, Meteor remained on the loose until Friday, when his owner, Robert Cissell, received a call that Meteor was struck by a vehicle on Route 29, according to a statement Cissell posted to social media. The animal was severely injured and euthanized at the scene.\n\nCissell declined to comment beyond his Facebook statement, but earlier this month said Meteor was worth more than $1,000 at market.\n\n\u201cOur greatest fears all along have revolved around his proximity to a major highway,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe have spent untold hours searching the fields, forests, and mountains around the county, assisted by local authorities, veterinarians, and other community members, who gave their time and energy to try and help us bring Meteor home safely.\u201d\n\nMeteor was \u201claid to rest in a private location,\u201d the statement said, and \u201chis spirit is now free and has taken flight.\u201d\n\nKevin Wright, the county\u2019s animal control supervisor, said Meteor was found about 8:30 a.m. Friday.\n\n\u201cWe hated that it ended this way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big guy went down.\u201d\n\nWright said there were no witnesses to the collision, speculating that Meteor was hit in the early-morning hours by a commercial vehicle. If the animal had been struck by a small car, Wright said the collision would have \u201cdestroyed\u201d the vehicle.\n\n\u201cWhoever did it kept on going,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Nelson County Farm Bureau paid tribute to Meteor in a social media post. The animal had been photographed behind the office of the nonprofit agricultural advocacy organization early in its run for freedom.\n\n\u201cSo very sad to share the news that Meteor, the elusive, escaped yak, tragically met his end this morning after being hit along US29 in Nelson County,\u201d the post read. \u201cMeteor\u2019s recent freedom excursion made local, national & worldwide headlines and forever earned him a place in our hearts. Roam free, Meteor!\u201d\n\nLaura Cooper, a member service specialist with the Farm Bureau, said her colleagues were saddened to learn of his death. She said the county flag was flying at half-staff at the county courthouse in tribute to the yak.\n\n\u201cOur community had grown so invested in the story of the escaped yak and hoped for a very different ending,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re all heartbroken for Meteor and his owner who has suffered such a devastating loss.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The Virginia yak charmed the Internet after escaping en route to slaughter.", "authors": ["Justin Wm.
