Your early developments will be faster and work better than others,\" said Henning Schulzrinne, computer science professor at Columbia University.\n\n\"This is a fundamental strategic competition for who builds the platform for the next round of the internet. That is just as important \u2014 if not more \u2014 than who builds the state-of-the-art harbors, railways and highways over the next 20 years.\"\n\n\u2014 Janice Stein, political science professor at the University of Toronto\n\nWhere things stand: The U.S. and China are locked in a race over whose technology will underly 5G networks that will connect devices and machines at lightning speed. The U.S. prefers European equipment makers Nokia and Ericsson, and it has shunned Chinese telecom giant Huawei due to fears of espionage.\n\nThe U.S. doesn't make its own 5G equipment but is using its military, security and intelligence heft to pressure allies not to use China's technology.\n\nits own 5G equipment but is using its military, security and intelligence heft to pressure allies not to use China's technology. \"We cannot ensure the defense of the West if our allies grow dependent on the East,\" Vice President Mike Pence said at the Munich Security Conference last month.\n\nthe defense of the West if our allies grow dependent on the East,\" Vice President Mike Pence said at the Munich Security Conference last month.

Tomorrow it\u2019s Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and the Chinese communist party.\"\n\nin terms of what data aggregators know about you and how they can influence your lives,\" said Rob Spalding, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. \"Today it\u2019s Amazon, Google, Facebook. Tomorrow it\u2019s Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and the Chinese communist party.\" \"This isn\u2019t about virtue. For most of the world, the question is who do you want to spy on you?\" says Stein.\n\nFlashback: Spalding, former senior director for Strategic Planning for the National Security Council, advocated for a national U.S. 5G network to stave off China's advances and concerns over espionage.\n\nThat plan proved unpopular, but the idea of a national network got support from Trump's re-election campaign (which then walked it back).\n\nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said at the Fintech Ideas Festival on Wednesday that concerns are valid about Chinese suppliers underpinning crucial infrastructure. Huawei's \"impressive\" global market share hurts the companies on which the U.S. relies.\n\n\"You can\u2019t separate national security from competitiveness and innovation,\" he said. \"They go hand in hand.\"\n\nThe other side: While many countries are nervous about China's growth, not everyone is convinced Chinese vendors are using their telecom gear to spy. (Huawei denies it, too.)\n\n\"There's no evidence at all that Huawei has put anything inappropriately in its equipment,\" said Entwistle. \"If they did and it was discovered, it would be game over for them.\"\n\nat all that Huawei has put anything inappropriately in its equipment,\" said Entwistle. \"If they did and it was discovered, it would be game over for them.\" Western vendors are still strong, he said, just not as strong as they were in the 3G era.\n\nare still strong, he said, just not as strong as they were in the 3G era. \"The anxiety here in a sense is a loss of prominence for western technology rather than demise of western technology,\" he said. \"This is more of a shift in balance rather than an apocalyptic situation.\"\n\nThe bottom line: China's lead in building the next-generation network is seen as a sign of a decline of U.S. tech leadership in the mobile internet, and as a symbolic point of no return for Chinese economic supremacy.\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "China's lead in building the next-generation network is seen as a sign of a decline of U.S. tech leadership.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/CsYRj-s1mCbCXkoCRa8PLt48e2k=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/03/27/1553700638863.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-28"}
