Can\u2019t be possible! Please ask him to read the Transcript of the call. Witch Hunt!\u201d\n\nThe attack was on-brand for Trump, who has a well-earned reputation as a counterpuncher when criticized. Just last week, Trump slammed Vietnam veteran and U.S. diplomat William Taylor, using the same \u201cNever Trumper\u201d insult after decrying such critics as \u201chuman scum.\u201d\n\nTrump has previously targeted critics with military ties and bipartisan respect, including the late Sen.

Amash: Some retiring GOP lawmakers may reenter politics once Trump is gone CNN hires former GOP Rep. Sean Duffy MORE (R-Wis.), ran into opposition from Republicans and highlighted a GOP divide even as the party seeks to shift its strategy on fighting Democrats over Trump's impeachment.\n\nVindman on Tuesday provided damaging testimony about Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nVindman, a firsthand witness to the phone call, told lawmakers that he was so concerned about Trump raising an investigation into Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, and his son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine that he reported it to the National Security Council\u2019s (NSC) lawyer, according to a copy of his prepared remarks that leaked out Monday night.\n\n\u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S. national security,\u201d his remarks read.\n\nVindman, a Ukrainian refugee who fled to the United States with his family at age 3, is a former infantry officer who has served for two decades in the U.S. Army. He has deployed overseas multiple times, including serving a tour in Iraq where he was wounded by an improvised explosive device and received a Purple Heart. He has been an Army foreign area officer since 2008 and was asked to join Trump\u2019s NSC in July 2018.\n\nVindman serves as the NSC\u2019s director of European affairs, a role one former NSC official described as apolitical and typically filled with detailees from other parts of the federal government.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an apolitical role,\u201d said the former official. \u201cYou\u2019re not part of the policy team in terms of coming up with policy, you\u2019re enacting policy.\u201d\n\nOne former Trump administration official said the barrage of attacks on witnesses like Vindman, Taylor and former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch can be demoralizing for other career officials still in government.\n\nThe barbs may not abate for some time, with a cast of current and former officials scheduled to testify.\n\nVindman\u2019s Tuesday testimony could prove problematic for the White House, particularly as Trump has urged his allies to focus on substance over process in defending him despite some reluctance from Republican lawmakers.\n\n\u201cI thank him for his service. I thank him for his commitment to this country, but he is wrong,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin Owen McCarthyTop Republicans say impeachment resolution is too little too late Shimkus says he's been asked to reconsider retirement Overnight Defense: Latest on al-Baghdadi's death | Trump weighs releasing raid video | Pentagon reveals 2 suspects captured in raid | House to vote on impeachment procedures | Border wall fight stalls defense bill MORE (R-Calif.) said of Vindman during a press conference.\n\nOther Republican lawmakers deflected Vindman\u2019s testimony by saying they felt the conduct outlined in the July 25 call was not impeachable.\n\nBut some of the president\u2019s allies suggested Vindman\u2019s Ukrainian roots might cloud his judgment.\n\n\u201cIt seems very clear that he is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense,\u201d said Duffy, the former congressman who is now a CNN commentator. \u201cI don't know that he's concerned about American policy, but his main mission was to make sure the Ukraine got those weapons. I understand that we all have an affinity to our homeland where we came from.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani Rudy Giuliani U.S. envoy to North Korea expected to be nominated for No. 2 job at State Department: report White House alerted in May of Ukraine's concerns with Giuliani: report Trump defends Giuliani as 'always looking for corruption' MORE claimed that Vindman felt \u201cconfused\u201d because he was \u201cadvising two [governments].\u201d\n\nRepublican strategists dismissed the impact of Trump\u2019s attacks, arguing Republicans may disagree with Trump over them but it wouldn\u2019t compromise the president\u2019s support amid the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cRepublicans who oppose that strategy will feel no compunction vocalizing that,\u201d said one Republican strategist, citing Cheney\u2019s remarks. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change the reality that he\u2019s not going to be convicted in the Senate and impeachment is a waste of time.\u201d\n\nGOP strategist Ford O\u2019Connell also said Trump is \u201cright to challenge the veracity of witnesses coming before Congress,\u201d noting that Vindman was presenting his opinion of Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky and that the partial transcript released by the White House did not show an explicit quid pro quo on the phone call.\n\nStill, it could complicate efforts to unify the White House and Republicans on messaging to effectively fend off the fast-moving impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks come as the White House is struggling to adopt a coherent strategy to counter the growing body of evidence of impropriety in Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine. One former White House official argued attacking witnesses wouldn\u2019t serve the purpose of a strategy unless the attacks were credible.\n\n\u201cThey have to rebut the claims and find credible angles of attack. Just blowtorching them isn\u2019t a strategy,\u201d said the former official.\n\n\u201cOverall, they should take a page from the Clinton playbook. Democrats are focused on tearing the president down instead of lifting the American people up; Democrats aren\u2019t focused on your hopes and dreams, they\u2019re focused on their own political ambition,\u201d the former official continued.\n\nHouse Democrats will vote on a resolution this week laying out the next steps for the investigation, with plans to take hearings with witnesses public over the next few weeks. The vote will force lawmakers to take a public position on the impeachment inquiry, which could work in the White House\u2019s favor by putting vulnerable Democrats in a tough position.\n\nThe White House has refused to cooperate with the inquiry, casting it as \u201cillegitimate\u201d because Democrats refused to subject it to a formal vote, but officials have not committed to cooperating once a vote takes place.\n\nJordain Carney contributed.", "description": "President Trump's aggressive attacks on a White House official who testified about his concerns over Trump's communications with Ukraine in the impeachment inquiry set off a furious backlash on Tuesday, with former Vice President Joe Biden calling", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/vindmanalexander_102919getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
