(Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)\n\nWhile Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg seemed cheerful and even jokey when he took the stage today in front of journalists and media executives (at one point, he described the event as \"by far the best thing\" he'd done this week), he acknowledged that there are reasons for the news industry to be skeptical.\n\nFacebook, after all, has been one of the main forces creating a difficult economic reality for the industry over the past decade. And there are plenty of people (including our own Josh Constine) who think it would be foolish for publishers to trust the company again.\n\nFor one thing, there's the question of how Facebook's algorithm prioritizes different types of content, and how changes to the algorithm can be enormously damaging to publishers.\n\n\"We can do a better job of working with partners to have more transparency and also lead time about what we see in the pipeline,\" Zuckerberg said, adding, \"I think stability is a big theme.\" So Facebook might be trying something out as an \"experiment,\" but \"if it kind of just causes a spike, it can be hard for your business to plan for that.\"\n\nAt the same time, Zuckerberg argued that Facebook's algorithms are \"one of the least understood things about what we do.\" Specifically, he noted that many people accuse the company of simply optimizing the feed to keep users on the service for as long as possible.\n\n\"That\u2019s actually not true,\" he said. \"For many years now, I've prohibited any of our feed teams ... from optimizing the systems to encourage the maximum amount of time to be spent. We actually optimize the system for facilitating as many meaningful interactions as possible.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, he said that when Facebook changed the algorithm to prioritize friends and family content over other types of content (like news), it effectively eliminated 50 million hours of viral video viewing each day. After the company reported its subsequent earnings, Facebook had the biggest drop in market capitalization in U.S. history.\n\nZuckerberg was onstage in New York with News Corp CEO Robert Thomson to discuss the launch of Facebook News, a new tab within the larger Facebook product that's focused entirely on news. Thomson began the conversation with a simple question: \"What took you so long?\"\n\nThe Facebook CEO took this in stride, responding that the question was \"one of the nicest things he could have said \u2014 that actually means he thinks we did something good.\"\n\nZuckerberg went on to suggest that the company has had a long interest in supporting journalism (\"I just think that every internet platform has a responsibility to try to fund and form partnerships to help news\"), but that its efforts were initially focused on the News Feed, where the \"fundamental architecture\" made it hard to find much room for news stories \u2014 particularly when most users are more interested in that content from friends and family.\n\nSo Facebook News could serve as a more natural home for this news (to be clear, the company says news content will continue to appear in the main feed as well). Zuckerberg also said that since past experiments have created such \"thrash in the ecosystem,\" Facebook wanted to make sure it got this right before launching it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn particular, he said the company needed to show that tabs within Facebook, like Facebook Marketplace and Facebook Watch, could attract a meaningful audience. Zuckerberg acknowledged that the majority of Facebook users aren't interested in these other tabs, but when you've got such an enormous user base, even a small percentage can be meaningful.\n\n\"I think we can probably get to maybe 20 or 30 million people [visiting Facebook News] over a few years,\" he said. \"That by itself would be very meaningful.\"\n\nFacebook is also paying some of the publishers who are participating in Facebook News. Zuckerberg described this as \"the first time we're forming long-term, stable relationships and partnerships with a lot of publishers.\"\n\nSeveral journalists asked for more details about how Facebook decided which publishers to pay, and how much to pay them. Zuckerberg said it's based on a number of factors, like ensuring a wide range of content in Facebook News, including from publishers who hadn't been publishing much on the site previously. The company also had to compensate publishers who are taking some of their content out from behind their paywalls.\n\nStory continues", "description": "While Facebook  CEO Mark Zuckerberg  seemed cheerful and even jokey when he took the stage today in front of journalists and media executives (at one point, he described the event as \"by far the best thing\" he'd done this week), he acknowledged that there are reasons for the news industry", "authors": ["Anthony Ha"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HhNqsTdpFCVWqqffOKKLcw--~B/aD0xNzQ5O3c9MjcxMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/techcrunch_350/bd58b83ffdbebd53283f78bacf572be3", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
