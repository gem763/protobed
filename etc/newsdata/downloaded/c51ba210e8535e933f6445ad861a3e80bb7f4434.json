AFR\n\n\u201cWe are experiencing a renewed interest in privacy,\" the former head of Internet Australia Laurie Patton said.\n\nIs finding a plumber or handyman on a Google Home really worth the potential risk that a consumer's data could be sold to some political group to win the next election in the manner of the Facebook\u2013Cambridge Analytica scandal?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"People need to know in really clear terms which they don't now ... how much information is going back to home base, what exactly is being done with it and who it is going to,\" Mr Sims told The Australian Financial Review in August off the back of his digital platforms inquiry.\n\nThe global backlash intensified in March after the Christchurch attacks in New Zealand were live-streamed on Facebook by the gunman, adding to growing public and political concern.\n\nMore recently, schools and parents are scrambling to respond to the viral video sharing sensation TikTok, amid concerns their children are sharing sexually explicit material.\n\nACCC's chairman Rod Sims is going after Google. Peter Braig\n\nThe regulator privately admits most consumers have no idea what is happening to their data or how it is being used.\n\nBut the sense that Google may be taking advantage of the public's reliance on everyday digital tools could still come back to bite them, especially when Google appear to be lagging their rivals.\n\nFacebook has already overhauled its approach to privacy and users are constantly prompted to review their privacy settings.\n\nApple also stores very little in the way of location data. The data stored in your phone when using Apple Maps is also very low.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy comparison, Google can plot a users precise location, how they got there and how long they stayed \u2013- all with a frightening level of detail.\n\nGoogle will remain most fearful of the response in the US with calls by Democrat presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren for a forced break-up or divestment which the Justice Department is also leaving on the table.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren is talking about breaking up the tech giants. Bloomberg\n\nBut Mr Sims \u2013 the man most feared in business \u2013 will not to be easily dismissed and is making it his mission in life to change the culture of the tech giants.\n\n\"Facebook and Google either comply with our laws or they don't do business in Australia,\" the regulator said.", "description": "Rod Sims landmark legal action against Google is more about publicly shaming the tech giant than causing any real financial pain.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4428%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_66/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/296dadbea94edfdefbc27651e6aab070b47918cd", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
