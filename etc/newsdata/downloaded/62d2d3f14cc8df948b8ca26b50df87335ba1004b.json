When you do that it means you have come back too soon.\n\n\u201cThat is not a slight on Emerson, everyone wants to play this game to fair play. But those things shouldn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cChristensen is a bang on the knee, which we need to assess. It was a shame to use up the two subs in the first half.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t give you any more than that \u2013 the doctor will assess.
