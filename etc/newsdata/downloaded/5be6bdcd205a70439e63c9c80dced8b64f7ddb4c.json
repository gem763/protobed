No one saw value at that level.\n\n\"But now he has got another $235,000 with five bidders competing. The buyer was an investor,\" Ms Bloom said.\n\nAnother example, she said, was the $6.3 million sale of 104 Caroline Street, also in South Yarra through Marshall White.\n\nThis three-bedroom Georgian home, sold vacant by a deceased estate and requiring extensive renovations, was quoted at $5 million to $5.5 million previously.\n\n\"Buyers are paying well over value,\" Ms Bloom said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPenthouse tops prices\n\nIn Sydney, the most notable sale was not at auction, but off the plan, with a local resident buying a $140 million penthouse across the top three levels of Lendlease's One Sydney Harbour project at Barangaroo.\n\nA rendering of the penthouse view from the yet-to-be-built Tower 1 in the One Sydney Harbour project.

The same week last year, the clearance rate was just 46 per cent. Melbourne managed a 75.1 per cent preliminary clearance rate from more than 900 auctions, down on the 75.2 per cent final auction clearance last week when volumes were higher.\n\nAMP Capital chief economist Dr Shane Oliver said sales volumes were up from lows, but still modest compared with 2013-17.\n\n\"Expect tight credit, unit supply and a soft economy to constrain prices after the initial bounce,\" he said.\n\nAmong the smaller auction markets, Canberra was the best performing with a preliminary auction clearance rate this week of 64.2 per cent, followed by Adelaide at 63.3 per cent.\n\nBrisbane managed a preliminary clearance rate of just 50 per cent from 140 auctions, while Perth came in at 58.3 per cent with just 28 auctions.", "description": "Auction clearance rates eased back this week eliciting a warning about house prices running out of steam but at the top end of the market, investors are paying over the odds due a lack of stock.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8568%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5d00d542c46d6d181ac129ece2924891f2ee92f5", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
