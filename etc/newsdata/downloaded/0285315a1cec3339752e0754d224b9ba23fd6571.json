Moreover, he thinks the halcyon days of growth and prosperity within US borders are wearing thin \u2014 and he isn't going to sugarcoat his perspectives, especially when it comes to the party he thinks is responsible for it all: the Federal Reserve.\n\n\"There's a limit to how long the Fed can continue to keep interest rates artificially low,\" he said in a recent edition of The Peter Schiff Show Podcast. \"The longer they succeed in keeping them low, the bigger the ultimate failure is going to be when it comes to everything collapsing down.\"\n\nTo him, the Fed's policies have created a massive bubble \u2014 via interest rate cuts and quantitative easing \u2014 that's artificially inflated assets of all kind within the US economy, and created an environment that is extremely speculative. What's worse, time is running out.\n\n\"You have the federal government borrowing record amounts of money, you have states and municipalities borrowing record amounts of money, you have corporations borrowing record amounts of money, you have individuals borrowing record amounts of money,\" he said.\n\nSchiff added: \"This whole phony economy that was built on artificially low interest rates implodes, and it's not a question of if it will happen, it's only a question of when.\"\n\nAnd he's just getting warmed up.\n\nSchiff points to the IPO market as a prime example of how the Fed's ultra-low interest rate policies are having a nefarious effect on today's market. In his view, it's made debt way too easy to come by, and has pushed valuations \u2014 undeservedly \u2014 into the stratosphere.\n\nRead more: A hedge fund manager who turned $126,000 of firmwide assets into $500 million explains his Warren Buffett-esque investment process \u2014 and why he's not concerned with today's stock market valuation\n\n\"One example of this, is what's going on with a lot of these stocks \u2014 these money-losing companies,\" he said. \"In the speculative fever that the Federal Reserve created, investors didn't care about how much money companies were losing \u2014 and they were investing in them anyway, because they just thought they would make money finding a greater fool to pay an even higher price.\"\n\nIt's hard to disagree with Schiff's point here. Companies that have garnered sky-high valuations in private markets have been getting crushed when they come public arena.\n\nHere's how some of the more notable IPOs issues have performed since offering their shares to the public:\n\nUber (UBER): -33%\n\n(UBER): -33% Lyft (LYFT): -43%\n\n(LYFT): -43% Slack (WORK): -17%\n\n(WORK): -17% Fiverr (FVRR): -15%\n\nAnd that's not counting WeWork and Endeavor, who recently postponed their IPOs amidst the turmoil.\n\nUnfortunately, the only way Schiff sees the problem being resolved has dismal implications \u2014 ones he thinks has the potential to upend the entire economy.\n\n\"Interest rates need to rise,\" he said. \"That's part of the cure, that's part of the solution. But when they do, we prick the bubble \u2014 and everything comes imploding down.\"", "description": "Peter Schiff, president and CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, thinks time is wearing thin for the US economy.", "authors": ["Christopher Competiello"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8e646a2e22af21af3c2522?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
