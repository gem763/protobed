I fucken love the future, and I fully welcome our robot overlords.\n\nCertainly is an upgrade on the last sauce robot we saw.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time the SauceBot has been put through its paces for the sake of the snag, it also came through for some important, political action over the federal election, thoroughly saucing up the democracy sausages for voters and sausij-enthusiasts at Scienceworks.\n\nHell yeah, I love this so much. I\u2019d have bought a whole bunch of sausage sangas at Bunnings just so I could watch the SauceBot do its thing over and over. I bloody hope Connected Community Hackerspace made a bucket of money off this.", "description": "SauceBot popped up at a Melbourne Bunnings over the weekend, precisely applying tomato sauce and mustard to snags and holy hell I love the future.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/sauce-bot-site.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
