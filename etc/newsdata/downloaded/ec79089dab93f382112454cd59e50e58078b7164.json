Since abruptly withdrawing troops from northeastern Syria this month and giving Turkey the green light to invade, Trump has faced a barrage of bipartisan criticism. Shortly after the president\u2019s remarks, an overwhelming majority in the House voted to condemn his new Syria policy. This climate of dissent \u2014 so widespread even Trump\u2019s most resolute toadies have gotten in on the act \u2014 put the president in a manically defensive mood.\n\nIn the Oval Office, Trump first availed himself of a banal \u201cAmerica first\u201d line of defense.\n\n\u201cIf Turkey goes into Syria, that\u2019s between Turkey and Syria,\u201d Trump explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not between Turkey and the United States, like a lot of stupid people would like us to \u2026 would like you to believe.\n\n\u201cOur soldiers are not in harm\u2019s way \u2014 as they shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 as two countries fight over land that has nothing to do with us,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd the Kurds are much safer right now.\u201d\n\nThis characterization of the conflict is a bit dubious. It\u2019s certainly true that the U.S. has no strong national interest in who governs northeastern Syria. But circumstances in that region don\u2019t have \u201cnothing to do with us.\u201d The Syrian Kurds took on massive casualties on our nation\u2019s behalf when we enlisted them to fight the theocratic death cult that our invasion of Iraq helped spawn. The Kurds made those sacrifices on the understanding that the U.S. government would not abruptly allow them to be slaughtered. That Trump has betrayed that expectation could adversely impact our government\u2019s ability to outsource world-policing to other \u201cmoderate rebels\u201d in the future (which, granted, might be for the best). Regardless, it is obviously not the case that the \u201cKurds are much safer now\u201d than they were when a small deployment of U.S. forces was keeping the Turkish army at bay.\n\nAnd then, Trump took his self-defense to a wild \u2014 and wildly counterproductive \u2014 level.\n\n\u201cBut the Kurds know how to fight,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cAnd, as I said, they\u2019re not angels. They\u2019re not angels, if you take a look \u2026 The PKK, which is a part of the Kurds \u2026 is probably worse at terror, more of a terrorist threat in many ways, than ISIS.\u201d\n\nHere, the president is within a 500-mile radius of a point. Much U.S. coverage of the present conflict has elided the fact that Turkey\u2019s security concerns aren\u2019t baseless. The Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) has been waging a violent separatist insurrection inside Turkey for decades. The PKK has targeted civilians, and the U.S. government has long considered it a terrorist organization. And the Kurdish militants we partnered with in Syria have deep ties to the PKK. Thus, it isn\u2019t hard to see why the Turkish government would find the presence of an autonomous Kurdish state, run by a militia that is aligned with a separatist terrorist movement within its borders, intolerable. The fact that partnering with the Syrian Kurds would inevitably steer the U.S. into a conflict with a NATO ally \u2014 in a region where the U.S. has few interests and Turkey serious national-security ones \u2014 was clear when the Obama administration first chose to do so. This crisis is not entirely of Trump\u2019s own making (even if he has handled it in the most destructive and inhuman way possible).\n\nBut the president wasn\u2019t content to cite the PKK\u2019s history of terrorism as a means of illustrating the complexity of the conflict he inherited. Instead, he opted to suggest that the secular Kurdish forces \u2014 whose animating mission is self-determination for their long-suffering ethnic group \u2014 are \u201cin many ways worse\u201d than a genocidal Islamist organization that aims at the destruction of all decent civilization.\n\nSuch a claim is not just ludicrous but self-indicting. After all, if it were actually the case that the PKK was more of a terror threat than ISIS, then Donald Trump would have presided over a policy of putting guns and money into the hands of the world\u2019s worst terrorist group. Which seems considerably worse than merely withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria in a manner that risks freeing ISIS prisoners and betrays a U.S. ally.", "description": "President Trump said Wednesday that the Kurdish forces who fought ISIS on America\u2019s behalf in Syria were \u201cnot angels\u201d and \u201cprobably worse at terror, more of a terrorist threat in many ways, than ISIS.\u201d", "authors": ["Eric Levitz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/16/16-trump.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
