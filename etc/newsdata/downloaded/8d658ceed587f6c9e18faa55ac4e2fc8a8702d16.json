It also describes Mattis attempting to head off directives from the president that could thrust the military further into politics and blocking decisions that he saw as illegal.\n\nMattis said wryly that he\u2019d \u201crather swallow acid\u201d than see the multimillion-dollar military parade that Trump wanted, the book said. It also alleged that Trump sought to \u201cscrew\u201d Amazon \u2014 whose founder, Jeff Bezos, also owns The Washington Post \u2014 by locking the company out of bidding for the Pentagon\u2019s $10 billion cloud networking contract known as JEDI, and that the secretary demurred.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to do that,\u201d Mattis told senior Pentagon officials, according to the book. \u201cThis will be done by the book, both legally and ethically.\u201d\n\nMattis and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. Other senior officials who worked for Mattis, including his chief of staff, retired Rear Adm. Kevin Sweeney, and his former top military adviser, Adm. Craig Faller, either declined to comment or could not be reached.\n\n\u201cADM Faller has not read the book, and we will not be commenting on it,\u201d said Army Col. Amanda Azubuike, a spokeswoman for Faller, in an email.\n\nThe book\u2019s author is retired Navy Cmdr. Guy Snodgrass, a former fighter pilot who served as a speechwriter and director of communications for Mattis. His writing is likely to be seen by some defense officials and service members as a betrayal of the former defense secretary, who called for secrecy and discretion among his staff.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn August, Snodgrass sued the Defense Department, alleging that the Pentagon was dragging out its standard prepublication process to make sure his work does not include classified material. Snodgrass stated in an affidavit that he reached out to Mattis about the book and that the secretary responded in an email that Snodgrass appeared \u201cto be violating the trust that permitted you as a member of my staff to be in private meetings in my office, where those of us carrying the responsibilities believed that all could speak freely in pre-decisional discussions.\u201d\n\nThe department cleared the book for release on Sept. 11, and it is set to be released next week.\n\nThe resulting work, a copy of which was obtained by The Post, is promoted as \u201can insider\u2019s sometimes shocking account\u201d of inner workings at the Pentagon, and follows insider books by several former Trump administration officials who worked at the White House.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMattis published a book of his own in September, \u201cCall Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead,\u201d but it only brushed on his time working for Trump and focused instead on lessons learned during his 41-year career as a Marine officer. He has said little that is critical about the president publicly, though he did mock him in a speech this month.\n\n\u201cI earned my spurs on the battlefield,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cDonald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor.\u201d\n\nSnodgrass declined to comment about the book on Tuesday night, citing its release schedule. He wrote on Twitter that he had been at the Pentagon earlier on Tuesday and was greeted by an Army colonel who pulled him aside and thanked him for \u201cbeing willing to tell our story.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was floored \u2026 and grateful,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nOf Mattis\u2019s departure, Snodgrass wrote that the framing of the decision by the Pentagon and some media outlets as a \u201cspur-of-the-moment decision made in a final moment of passion\u201d about Trump\u2019s planned Syria withdrawal \u201cwasn\u2019t quite right.\u201d Mattis\u2019s \u201coutrage over Syria\u201d was real, Snodgrass wrote, but the situation was more complicated.\n\nAD\n\nSnodgrass recalled going to Mattis\u2019s office one day in summer 2018 to coordinate his schedule with Mattis\u2019s, and being admonished to keep his voice down. Mattis was meeting with John F. Kelly, a fellow retired Marine general, who was then Trump\u2019s chief of staff. The meeting wasn\u2019t listed on any schedule and was about departures, Mattis\u2019s scheduler told him. A look at Mattis\u2019s schedule for 2019 showed that he had nothing significant planned.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t take long before others around the secretary\u2019s personal staff started to catch on, especially those planning events months into the future,\u201d Snodgrass wrote. \u201cSeveral approached me in late summer, asking what I knew. I demurred. It wasn\u2019t my story to tell, nor would my telling it have improved morale.\u201d\n\nThat story contradicts reassurances last fall that Mattis planned to stay in his job. Even after Trump said last October in a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview that \u201cit could be\u201d that Mattis was leaving, Pentagon spokeswoman Dana W. White said that he \u201cis not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSnodgrass joined Mattis\u2019s staff as an active-duty officer in April 2017, several months after the Trump administration took office. While Snodgrass found Trump\u2019s \u201cethics and character appalling,\u201d he wrote, he admired Mattis. Still, Snodgrass wrote, he was \u201caware that working for the secretary of defense would effectively be a political job in the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe book raised a number of issues that have been reported before, including internal concerns at the Pentagon that Mattis\u2019s staff compromised the American principle of civilian control of the military by relying on too many military officers. Mattis\u2019s penchant for keeping staffs small, coupled with the Pentagon\u2019s struggle to find political appointees and get them confirmed, also left numerous staff members working 14-hour days before burning out and resigning.\n\nIn March 2018, Mattis lost administration allies when Trump fired the-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the president\u2019s national security adviser. While Mattis\u2019s relationship with McMaster had been \u201cstrained at best\u201d because of the general\u2019s \u201cforceful\u201d personality and tendency to lecture people, Snodgrass wrote, the departures left Mattis more exposed.\n\nAD\n\nThe former speechwriter also described unreported scenes inside a Pentagon meeting with Trump on Jan. 18, 2018, that have received a fair amount of media coverage. When the Afghanistan war came up, Snodgrass recalled, Trump unloaded.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSeriously, who gives a sh-- about Afghanistan?\u201d Trump said, according to the book. \u201cSo far we\u2019re in for $7 trillion, fellas \u2026 $7 trillion including Iraq. Worst decision ever and we\u2019re stuck with it. We could just get out of 90 percent of our commitments and countries, and just bring it all home.\u201d\n\nTrump added a few moments later that the United States should follow China\u2019s policy and \u201cjust go into Afghanistan and take out all that wealth,\u201d an apparent reference to China investing in mining.\n\nTrump then raised the prospect of having a military parade again, and Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said it would cost a lot and have bad optics because it would resemble events held by Russia, North Korea and other authoritarian regimes, the book said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBut \u2026 think about the spirit!\u201d Trump responded, according to the book.\n\nAs the relationship between Mattis and Trump frayed, Snodgrass wrote, so did morale on Mattis\u2019s staff. Sweeney, the chief of staff, and Faller, the senior officer on Mattis\u2019s staff, would \u201cberate\u201d people when Mattis had a \u201csour\u201d mood, the book said.\n\nSnodgrass wrote that he also watched Mattis\u2019s relationship with the press begin to falter, especially after a trusted senior adviser, Sally Donnelly, left after a year. While the Pentagon said that she wanted to return to the private sector, Sweeney, Faller and White had started a \u201cwhispering campaign\u201d against her, alleging without sharing evidence that she might be leaking information to the press, Snodgrass alleged.\n\nDonnelly and White both declined to comment.\n\nSnodgrass wrote that White, the Pentagon spokeswoman, was \u201cloathed by the press\u201d and used assignments traveling with Mattis as incentive for journalists not to write negative stories.\n\nAD\n\n\u201c\u2018Never forget, Bus. The press is the enemy,\u201d Snodgrass recalled White saying, using his pilot call sign. \u201cThey are not your friend.\u2019\u201d\n\nSnodgrass wrote that he disagrees with that perspective and thinks the press could have been tougher on Mattis.\n\nThe book also described Snodgrass\u2019s personal falling-out with Sweeney and Faller after he declined to take a Navy assignment that would have put him in line to someday command an aircraft carrier. After years of travel, Snodgrass wrote, he wanted to command a carrier air wing rather than take another assignment that would require him to be away from his family a lot.\n\nAfter he left the Navy, Snodgrass stayed on Mattis\u2019s staff as a civilian for several months and then was offered another job in the Pentagon outside of Mattis\u2019s inner circle. It was blocked by Sweeney, Snodgrass alleged. He appealed to Mattis directly in an email for support, he wrote, but received none and resigned instead.\n\nBut Snodgrass praised Mattis\u2019s overall efforts.", "description": "\"Holding the Line,\" by retired Navy Cmdr.
