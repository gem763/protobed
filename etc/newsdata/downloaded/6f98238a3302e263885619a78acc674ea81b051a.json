The express that hit Billy Vunipola during Sunday\u2019s game, on the other hand, arrived right on time. It was called Zane Kapeli, and it caught him flush in the chest just as he was breaking into a sprint up field off the back of a lineout. Vunipola staggered backwards, fell flat on his backside, and blinked in disbelief.\n\nTuilagi double helps England kick off with bonus-point win against Tonga Read more\n\nVunipola said he had been waiting for it. Tonga\u2019s coach Toutai Kefu had warned him that his team were going to enjoy trying to \u201cget into Billy\u2019s face and smash him\u201d. Kapeli seemed to take particular pleasure in it. He came at him like a rhino making a desperate charge at the safari park fence in a last bid for freedom. Vunipola got back to his feet, and grinned sheepishly at his teammates. \u201cI was waiting for it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it still took me by surprise a little bit.\u201d He admitted it was \u201cprobably my fault, I told Fordy to give it to me. I gave them the opportunity, and they took it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey came and got me.\u201d\n\nThe blow won the Tongans a penalty, which Sonatane Takulua lined up while seismologists around the Pacific rim double-checked their equipment looking for the source of the recent tremor. The decision might have gone the other way. Kapeli hit Vunipola low, but he led with his shoulder. \u201cOh to be honest I wasn\u2019t thinking too much about the details of where my arms were,\u201d he admitted later. \u201cI just put my head down and hoped for the best.\u201d His best was plenty. In six years of Test rugby, no one has ever hit Vunipola like that. But then, like Kapeli said, \u201cthere\u2019s definitely a bit of edge to it when we\u2019re facing those Tongan fellas\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018That was a tough, tough match,\u2019 said Billy Vunipola after England\u2019s victory over Tonga.

He was happy to come through it. He had spoken before the game about what a strange occasion it would be for him. He was born in Sydney, and grew up in Wales and England, but he thinks of himself as being both English and Tongan, just like his father, Fe\u2019ao, who captained them the first time they played England in a World Cup, at Twickenham back in 1999. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case,\u201d Kefu said, mischievously, before the match, \u201che should be playing for us.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nVunipola\u2019s eyes kept darting up to the big screen so he could watch the Tongans singing their national anthem, which he knows all the words to, and after the match, he joined a group of them in a prayer. \u201cHe played well against his brothers, didn\u2019t he,\u201d Eddie Jones said, \u201cthat\u2019s not easy to do.\u201d He really did have family on the other side. His grandparents were cousins of the grandparents of Tonga\u2019s prop Vunipola Fifita. But still, Jones was being generous. By his own standards, Vunipola struggled to get into the game. It did not help him that Kapeli seemed to keep picking him out for special treatment.\n\nEngland 35-3 Tonga: five talking points from England\u2019s World Cup opener Read more\n\nKapeli made 10 tackles in the match, and at least four of them were on Vunipola. He cleared him out of a ruck with a tip-tackle that turned him leg over head, and caught him with a chop on the shins as he burst off the back of a five metre scrum on England\u2019s line, too. That one brought him down like a California Redwood. On the odd occasions Vunipola did manage to get up and running, legs pumping, he always seemed to end up being sucked into the orbit of Tonga\u2019s 25-stone roadblock of a prop, Ben Tameifuna. He\u2019d have had better luck charging the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.\n\nVunipola\u2019s not the only man who is going to feel a few conflicting emotions during the tournament. Around a fifth of the players here qualify for more than one country. The previous day the crowd at the Sapporo Dome had seen two men born in Australia playing for Fiji take on three men born in Fiji playing for Australia. Eight of this Tongan squad were born in New Zealand, two more in Australia. Some of them even dabbled with playing for other countries, their centre Cooper Vuna even played two Tests for Australia in 2012, a couple of his teammates played for their U20s team, another was in their sevens set-up.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Billy Vunipola always seemed to end up being sucked into the orbit of Tonga\u2019s 25-stone roadblock of a prop, Ben Tameifuna, here being grabbed by George Ford. Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images\n\nVuna said he wants to persuade Vunipola to come back and play for them when he is finished with England. Vunipola was not having that. \u201cI am who I am,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m proud to represent England, I\u2019ve worked my whole life to be where I am right now and it\u2019s not something I\u2019d turn my back on. It\u2019s just that I know who I am and where I come from.\u201d\n\nKapeli\u2019s been on a journey of his own. He is 26, just like Vunipola. But while Billy went off to become a superstar in England, he has been playing rugby league for the Waiheke Rams, and working as an apprentice builder in Canterbury.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen many people do that to Billy before,\u201d I told him when we were talking after the game. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cbut then I haven\u2019t played a lot of footy in the UK.\u201d", "description": "The England No 8 with Tongan heritage survived a bruising encounter unscathed after receiving special treatment", "authors": ["Andy Bull"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30dea8d55586208038bd4bef4f5d3e3c4af5e5d2/0_136_3309_1986/master/3309.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ec951e89ff8d082e4204c621841d836b", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
