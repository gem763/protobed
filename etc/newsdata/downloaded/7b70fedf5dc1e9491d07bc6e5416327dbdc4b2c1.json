Germany was maybe the fastest to drop, but clearly this is all over the European carmakers now,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Matthias Wellhausen told Reuters.\n\nThe Lucerne-based company is seeking higher productivity and looking for extra contracts for its steel mills. It has scrapped some shifts, introduced short-time working and extended its summer shutdown.\n\n\u201cWe do see the destocking continuing, but eventually that will have to end and companies will buy new steel eventually,\u201d Wellhausen said at the end of last month.\n\nThe Swiss franc\u2019s rise is also curbing exports, the government said on Tuesday. Strength in the safe-haven currency makes Swiss exports more expensive abroad.\n\nThe Swiss National Bank, which has been battling against the strong franc for eight years, holds its quarterly policy review on Thursday.\n\nWellhausen said 30% of his company\u2019s costs were in francs but all its revenue was in euros. \u201cBut if I had only one wish, I\u2019d ask for the volumes to come back,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother company hit is Autoneum (AUTON.S), which makes auto components to reduce sound and protect cars from heat. It swung to a 6 million franc first-half loss from a 60.1 million franc profit a year earlier.\n\n\u201cThe global automotive recession is noticeable in lower volumes, which is leading to lower capacity utilization, especially in our European and Asian plants,\u201d Chief Executive Martin Hirzel said.\n\nThe company, which has a plant in eastern Switzerland, has cut costs, reduced temporary workers and frozen hiring.\n\n\u201cAt the moment there is no sign of a market recovery in the short term,\u201d Hirzel said. \u201cThe markets and overall macroeconomic environment remain very challenging.\u201d", "description": "The Swiss government cut its 2019 growth forecast by a third on Tuesday, citing as risks the escalating trade war between China and the United States, the rising Swiss franc and the drastic slowdown in neighboring Germany.", "authors": ["John Revill", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
