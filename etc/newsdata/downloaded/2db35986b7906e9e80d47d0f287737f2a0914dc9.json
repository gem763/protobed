Elizabeth Warren stakes her claim as true heir to Obama legacy", "language": "en", "text": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren is gaining on Joseph R. Biden in the Democratic presidential race and, of course, she has a plan to beat him: Shatter the image of the former vice president as heir to the Obama legacy.\n\nThe senator from Massachusetts is offering Democrats an Obama-esque vision that Mr. Biden can\u2019t match with his meandering message about fighting racism and restoring the status quo in a post-Trump America.\n\nAlthough Ms. Warren would steer the country much further left, her plans for a socialist-style makeover echo Mr. Obama\u2019s promise in 2008 of \u201cfundamentally transforming the United States of America.\u201d\n\nNeil Sroka, a spokesman for Democracy for America who worked on the 2008 Obama campaign, said Ms. Warren is a more natural heir to the Obama \u201cchange\u201d mantle.\n\n\u201cI think that in some ways \u2014 both explicitly and implicitly \u2014 her candidacy is much more clearly about change than Joe Biden\u2019s could almost ever be, because she is not only exclusively calling for change in her policy proposals, but because she isn\u2019t tied to a past administration as clearly as Biden is,\u201d Mr. Sroka said.\n\nHe said Hillary Clinton faced a similar challenge with Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential primary race.\n\n\u201cShe understood the political winds of the moment and would try to have a change message, and she certainly would have been a change compared to Bush, but just because of who she was and her history within the party and within national politics, she struggled,\u201d he said. \u201cBiden has a similar problem.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden held on to the front-runner position, but his poll numbers have been on a downward trajectory since he entered the race in April while Ms. Warren\u2019s have been climbing.\n\nNational and Iowa polls this week show the race has narrowed to a two-way contest between Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren.\n\nAt a Monday rally in New York\u2019s Washington Square Park that drew more than 20,000 people, Ms. Warren made the pitch that she is the one to move the Democratic Party forward.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot at stake in this election, and I know people are scared, but we can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in just because we\u2019re too scared to do anything else. And Democrats can\u2019t win if we\u2019re scared and looking backward,\u201d she told the crowd.\n\nShe insisted later that she wasn\u2019t talking about Mr. Biden, who has pinned his White House ambitions on his ties to the popular Mr. Obama and a promise to make American normal again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s talking about whether we\u2019re going to turn backwards and just say, \u2018The only problem is Trump. If we get rid of Trump, everything is going to be just fine,\u2019\u201d she said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren\u2019s allies, though, are concerned that she could be peaking too soon.\n\nThey point out that massive crowds rallied behind Howard Dean\u2019s change message in 2004 before his presidential campaign fizzled out after a lackluster showing in Iowa.\n\nOthers see plenty of room for Ms. Warren to keep expanding her base.\n\n\u201cThe two biggest honey pots for Elizabeth Warren to grow are Biden supporters and undecided voters, all of whom are electability voters who increasingly see her as the best foot forward against Donald Trump,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.\n\nHe said part of Ms. Warren\u2019s appeal is her ability to deliver the Obama message in new ways.\n\n\u201cWarren is merging the desire for big change that Barack Obama campaigned on with Donald Trump\u2019s strategy of uniting the bases of both parties against the corrupt system itself,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cAsking whose side the government is on is not a left-versus-right issue. It is an insider-versus-outsider message. That is the appeal of her message. \u2026 That\u2019s why we cannot afford to nominate an establishment insider.\u201d\n\nThe pro-Warren Progressive Change Campaign Committee has tracked voters who have switched support from Mr. Biden to Ms. Warren. Their comments highlight Ms. Warren\u2019s image as a transformational figure.\n\nA voter identified as David M. of Tampa, Florida, told the group that he made the switch because \u201cBiden seems old-school political with no concrete values\u201d and Ms. Warren offers a \u201crealistic pathway to a modern, fair economy.\u201d\n\nA modern, fair economy was precisely what Mr. Obama promised in 2008.\n\n\u201cYou can choose policies that invest in our middle class and create new jobs and grow this economy so that everyone has a chance to succeed, not just the CEO, but the secretary and janitor, not just the factory owner, but the men and women on the factory floor,\u201d Mr. Obama intoned at a 2008 campaign stop in Columbia, Missouri.\n\nThe stories of voters swinging their support behind Ms. Warren back up what activists see in Iowa.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard anyone say they are moving to Biden,\u201d said Rod Sullivan, a supervisor of Johnson County Iowa, and a Warren supporter.\n\nMr. Sullivan backed Mr. Obama early on in the 2008 presidential race and says he sees similarities to Ms. Warren.\n\n\u201cThey are both beneficiaries of that hunger and thirst for significant change and \u2026 in two different ways they are both groundbreaking,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Democratic strategist Zach Friend, who worked on the 2008 Obama campaign, scoffed at the idea that Ms. Warren was closer to the Obama mold.\n\n\u201cThere may not be a candidate that is the direct heir to the Obama legacy, but it\u2019s clear some candidates, like Vice President Biden, are embracing Obama policies more than others \u2014 including Sen. Warren and [Sen. Bernard] Sanders,\u201d he said. \u201cObama remains one of the most popular figures with Democratic voters, so running away from his policies, or questioning some of his approaches, might not be the best strategic decision and for that matter might not line up with the average Democratic voter\u2019s priorities.\u201d\n\nThe Biden camp has pushed back against calls by Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders to scrap Obamacare and replace it with a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d government-run health care system.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s team argues that such socialist-style policies are unpopular with voters in Rust Belt states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that Democrats need to win back in 2020.\n\nMr. Sullivan said Mr. Obama\u2019s real gift was his personal touch with voters and that Ms. Warren is closer to him in that regard on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cBiden is leaning on the Obama policy stuff, which I don\u2019t think Democrats dislike, but it didn\u2019t light them on fire,\u201d he said. \u201cThe stuff that lit them on fire with Barack were personal characteristics.\n\n\u201cObama really made you feel like you were being heard. I don\u2019t think Joe has that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Warren, she is a lot better in that area than people thought. She is a good listener, and her mind is a steel trap. She remembers everything.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.", "description": "Sen.
