I had to block the number.\"\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nIn one voicemail, he said: \"F****** phone me. I've not f****** messaged her. You're f****** leaving me here, it's ridiculous.\"\n\nAt Kilmarnock Sheriff Court last month, Pattie admitted placing his former partner in a state of fear or alarm between July 2017 and January this year.\n\nHe is due to be sentenced this month.\n\nMs Howie said: \"He was obsessive, manipulative, controlling and a pathological liar.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\n\"I had no choice but to contact the police as he wouldn't leave me alone and his work wouldn't do anything.\n\n\"But even after admitting everything in court, he still had his job. It was like what he did didn't matter.\n\n\"He was a prison officer helping look after people who were in jail for doing a lot less than what he did to me.\n\n\"I don't know how Serco could even guarantee his safety or that of his colleagues if inmates found out that he had been convicted too.\"\n\nPattie, of Kilmarnock, did not respond to the Record's request for comment.\n\nMichael Guy, Serco's prison director at HMP Kilmarnock, said: \"When this matter was brought to our attention earlier in the year, we took all the appropriate steps necessary at that time.\n\n\"It is now a matter for the police and the courts.\"", "description": "Prison officer Joe\u00a0Pattie, 23, would call Blayre Howie, 23, up to 70 times a day and turn up at her home and work in Kilmarnock", "authors": ["Jennifer Hyland", "Image", "Daily Record"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20574635.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_unnamed-3-copyJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
