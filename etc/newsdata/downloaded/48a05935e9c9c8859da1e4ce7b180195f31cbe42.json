During that time, they also located a third body that was hidden away in the last room.\n\nFamily members have identified one of the bodies as Lukas Ntshabeleng, 45, who had been missing since April 26, said police spokesperson Captain Augustinah Selepe.\n\nREAD: Third body found in Pretoria cave\n\nShe added that the family had registered a missing person case 5 May 5 at the Pretoria West police station.\n\nTwo other families have come forward, so that DNA testing can be conducted in an effort to identify the two other bodies which are badly decomposed.\n\n\"We are waiting for the DNA results to be able to positively identify the deceased, time of death and cause of death,\" said Selepe.\n\nIt is believed that Ntshabeleng was a member of the Zion Christian Church and that he may have visited the cave to go and pray.\n\nHe did so during a time when a man, who is a self-proclaimed prophet, had been living in the cave, according to the property owners.\n\nPolice say no arrests have been made yet.\n\n\n\n", "description": "One of three bodies discovered in a cave near Vlakplaas, west of Pretoria, has been positively identified as a man who has been missing since April.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7303/199a4c729a4345288eae635fd306806a.jpg", "published_at": "2018-05-31"}
