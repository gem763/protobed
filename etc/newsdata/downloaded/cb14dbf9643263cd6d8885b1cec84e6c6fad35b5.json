But the schoolyard taunt offered another window into Trump\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m rubber, you\u2019re glue\u201d approach to the impeachment inquiry now consuming his administration.\n\nAD\n\nThough the White House has yet to launch an official war room to fight the Democratic investigation, it is putting forth something of a one-man platoon in the form of the president himself \u2014 in the role of playground bully, wielding his shamelessness like a weaponized rubber kickball, ready to pummel into the mud anyone who dares to level a charge against him.\n\nThe tactic epitomizes Trump\u2019s \u201cI know you are but what am I?\u201d presidency, a long-held strategy in which Trump turns an accusation back forcefully on his accuser, regardless of how outlandish or fallacious the countercharge may be.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s approach to turning his opponents\u2019 attacks back on them is part branding, part trolling and part relentless, disciplined messaging,\u201d said Cliff Sims, a former White House aide and author of \u201cTeam of Vipers,\u201d about his time working in the Trump administration. \u201cIt\u2019s proven to be extraordinarily effective. But it\u2019s not even replicable because no one else is audacious enough to pull it off.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAn early, indelible example of this Trump gambit came during the 2016 presidential campaign, during the third and final debate with his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. At one point, after Clinton asserted that Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin had praised Trump because \u201che\u2019d rather have a puppet as president of the United States,\u201d Trump cut her off.\n\n\u201cNo puppet! No puppet!\u201d Trump asserted. \u201cYou\u2019re the puppet.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMore recently, Trump turned accusations of racism back on the same minority lawmakers whom he had offended. After sending a racist tweet, for instance, in which he urged the four Democratic congresswomen \u2014 known as \u201cthe Squad\u201d \u2014 to \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they came from, Trump described them in another message as \u201ca very Racist group of troublemakers who are young, inexperienced, and not very smart.\u201d And after Trump described the majority-black district of Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who is also black and chairs the House Oversight Committee, as a \u201crat and rodent infested mess,\u201d the president twice accused his Democratic critics of playing \u201cthe race card\u201d and called Cummings \u201cracist\u201d in a tweet.\n\nAD\n\nEven some of his loyal defenders are unsure whether to applaud or condemn his sheer brazenness.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, I\u2019m like: \u2018That\u2019s brilliant. That\u2019s really effective,\u2019 \u201d said a former White House aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share a candid assessment of the president. \u201cAnd on the other hand, I\u2019m like . . . \u2018Do the ends always justify the means?\u2019 I\u2019m very conflicted about it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNow, facing one of the biggest political fights of his presidency, Trump is deploying the same battle plan.\n\nAfter a July phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for \u201ca favor\u201d to help dig up dirt on possible 2020 political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter, the president found himself facing an impeachment inquiry into whether he was attempting to use a foreign power to improperly influence the election.\n\nAD\n\nAnd so on Tuesday, the White House counsel released a letter to congressional Democrats effectively accusing them of the same misdeed \u2014 trying to improperly influence the 2020 presidential contest.\n\n\u201cMany Democrats now apparently view impeachment not only as a means to undo the democratic results of the last election, but as a strategy to influence the next election, which is barely more than a year away,\u201d the letter read.\n\nAD\n\nThe president has publicly called for China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, and on Wednesday, he and his campaign used Twitter and a TV ad to suggest with scant evidence that it is the Bidens, not him, who are guilty of wrongdoing.\n\nGoing back a bit further, Trump has frequently cast doubt on the assessment of his own intelligence community\u2019s findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential elections with the goal of helping elect him president. But now, he is turning the charge back on his political foes, espousing an unfounded conspiracy theory that a foreign government did interfere in the 2016 contest \u2014 but that it was Ukraine, with the goal of helping Democrats.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is a better counterpuncher than Floyd Mayweather, and it starts with his ability to turn a perceived weakness into a position of strength,\u201d said Jason Miller, a senior adviser on Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s unorthodox, it confuses political opponents, and it works.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMany of the allegations against the president boil down to the notion that he is abusing his power \u2014 another charge Trump regularly lobs at Democrats.\n\nHe has, for instance, repeatedly accused Democrats of \u201cobstruction,\u201d even while actively stonewalling two congressional investigations himself: The first a congressional inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election and now the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nAnd standing accused of overstepping the bounds of his executive authority, Trump on Wednesday took to Twitter to make clear that he believes former president Barack Obama is guilty of the same abuse.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPresident Obama said that he did not have the right to sign DACA, that it will never hold up in court,\u201d Trump tweeted, an apparent reference to the Supreme Court\u2019s plans this term to take up the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which has allowed hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants, known as \u201cdreamers,\u201d to remain in the country without the threat of deportation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf the Supreme Court upholds DACA, it gives the President extraordinary powers, far greater than ever thought,\u201d he continued.\n\nDan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser in the Obama White House and a co-host of the \u201cPod Save America\u201d podcast, said Trump and his allies are operating under a philosophy of \u201cwhataboutism\u201d \u2014 deflecting from his flaws and problems by trying to accuse his opponents of similar misdeeds.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s strategy is based on the idea that down deep, he is never going to be able to convince people he\u2019s good, but he might be able to convince people that everyone is as bad as he is,\u201d Pfeiffer said. \u201cTrump\u2019s lies and Trump\u2019s conduct are indefensible, so they don\u2019t try to defend it \u2014 they just try to say everyone else is more like Trump than you think.\u201d\n\nThe sheer shamelessness of this approach leads to a type of asymmetrical warfare that is tough to counterprogram, he added.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d Pfeiffer said, \u201ckeeps Democrats up at night.\u201d\n\n\n\nAD", "description": "The president wields his shamelessness like a weaponized kickball, ready to pummel into the mud anyone who dares to level a charge against him.", "authors": ["Ashley Parker", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Qqi3XysmFXq9lu82nGbNaNFDuyk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SFAGL7HK3QI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
