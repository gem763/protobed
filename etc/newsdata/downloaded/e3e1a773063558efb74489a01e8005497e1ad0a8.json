It will not be the last.\n\nWhile the utility says the outage might have prevented wildfires in several northern counties \u2014 and the company showed photos of downed power lines as evidence \u2014 it certainly caused millions of dollars in damage to closed businesses, generator-less households and others in places where the weather never lived up to the predicted conditions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe tactic is designed to minimize fire risk in a state where increasingly sudden, severe changes in the weather have intensified the frequency of wildfire damage. But the outage infuriated many California residents and politicians, including Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), who on Monday called on state regulators to investigate the shut-off.\n\nIn a letter to the California Public Utilities Commission, Newsom wrote that the \u201cscope and duration of this outage was unacceptable.\u201d He said a comprehensive review is \u201ccritical so we can take concrete and expedited steps to both limit and focus the use of [intentional outages] as a wildfire prevention tool in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was the direct result of decades of PG&E prioritizing profit over public safety,\u201d Newsom wrote. \u201cIt was clear from the start that PG&E implemented this extraordinary measure with astounding neglect and lack of preparation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs much of Northern California contended with the outage, warm, dry winds whipped through Los Angeles, sparking up two wildfires that forced tens of thousands of residents to evacuate homes. Those fires have been blamed for three deaths.\n\nThe winds, known as Santa Anas, died down over the weekend, giving firefighters in northern Los Angeles and Riverside counties a chance to contain the fires. As of Monday, the evacuation orders for those potentially in the path of the Saddleridge and Sandalwood fires had been lifted and the fires mostly contained.\n\nSouthern California Edison, the utility that serves northern Los Angeles County, shut down power to 13,000 customers before the fires began amid stiffening winds. But it did not do so in Sylmar, a town in the county\u2019s far north that has burned before, where residents reported seeing flames near an Edison electricity transmission tower along Saddle Ridge Road.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Saddleridge Fire has destroyed 35 homes and burned more than 8,000 acres in the northern San Fernando Valley, near the Ventura County border. Edison told the Los Angeles Times it will cooperate with the investigation into the fire\u2019s cause.\n\nIn recent years, California\u2019s fall wildfire season has extended to much of the year with wet winters and springs followed quickly by hot, dry summers, which parch the natural fuel that flourished with the rains. High winds common this time of year can both knock down power lines, which start fires, and drive the flames across the landscape at great speeds.\n\nState laws hold utilities \u201cstrictly liable\u201d when their equipment starts fires and causes damage, even if there is no negligence. Utility companies have spent heavily in the past two years lobbying state lawmakers unsuccessfully to loosen the liability rule, among the nation\u2019s strictest.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNewsom and other state leaders have expressed little sympathy for PG&E since the shutdown, which potentially complicated its push for relief. In his Monday letter to the commission, Newsom said he would be calling on PG&E to help offset the economic loss by issuing a billing credit of $100 to residential customers and $250 to small businesses affected by the shutdown.\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year as it faced more than $20 billion in liability claims from recent fires, including the state\u2019s most deadly, which last November burned through the town of Paradise, killing 85 people and destroying 14,000 homes.\n\nThe utility posted a notice Monday reminding potential plaintiffs that they have until Oct. 21 to file a claim in bankruptcy court against the company.\n\nAD", "description": "Utility says downed power lines could have been fire risk as infuriated governor called on state regulators to investigate the intentional outage.", "authors": ["Scott Wilson", "Senior National Correspondent Focusing On California", "The West"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GMynsjnUOQvht9_1s8Er929yHKs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TLRY4MHOWEI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
