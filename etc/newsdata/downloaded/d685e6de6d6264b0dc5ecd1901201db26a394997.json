'I've sat in the punditry chair for a year so I understand the need to say things.\n\n'I'm certainly not going to bang on too much. In terms of him - yeah, we have a relationship.'\n\nWhile Mourinho has been out of work since leaving United in December, Lampard has led Derby to the Championship play-off final and taken over at Chelsea in a move sparked by a closer managerial mentor.\n\n'Harry Redknapp is Uncle Harry so it would sound wrong if I didn't speak to him, but he was great for me in getting me the role at Derby,.\n\n'What he did for me in terms of getting me on the ladder managerially is huge and I will always be thankful for that.\n\n'He was close to Mel Morris [Derby chairman]. He followed us brilliantly last year.\n\nLampard's uncle, Harry Redknapp, oversaw his formative years at Bournemouth and West Ham\n\nThe new Chelsea coach admitted his father, Frank Lampard Snr, is one of his sternest critics\n\nDutch master Guus Hiddink, who had two interim spells at Chelsea, has contacted Lampard\n\nLampard (second from right) has guided Chelsea to four successive wins in all competitions\n\n'He would text me and call me to talk about Derby and is doing the same at Chelsea so I have to shout Harry even though he is family.\n\n'Guus Hiddink has actually sent me some great messages.\n\n'Harry comes with things and they are messages or chat but my dad, as through my playing days, is my biggest critic.\n\nLampard and Jose: specialists in success Premier League: 2004\u201305, 2005\u201306 FA Community Shield: 2005 FA Cup: 2007 Football League Cup: 2005, 2007\n\n'You would score a hat-trick and he would have a go at you for the one you missed and maybe he's pretty similar, probably slowed down a little bit.\n\n'Sometimes my dad, I feel, is a bit of the old school and we clash sometimes. I don't mind listening to it as it's important to have your ears opened, even if it's my dad who is saying, \"why didn't you go 4-4-2 and stick it long for the last 10 minutes?\"\n\n'You go, \"we are trying to play here, dad. We are trying to play from the goalkeeper sometimes rather than going long.\" But it can trigger a little something in your mind that maybe there is another angle to this.\n\n'I'm certainly not sitting here and saying I want us to play out from the back no matter what.\n\n'I want us to do the best thing that the game dictates and sometimes you play against high pressing teams where you have to mix your game up, which is huge for us and try and be unpredictable in that sense.\n\n'Sometimes my dad would ask the question why we played a short ball in our own 18 yard box and I get that.'", "description": "Mourinho singled out England stars Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham, as well as Denmark defender Andreas Christensen, while working as a TV pundit at Old Trafford.", "authors": ["Ben Miller For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/10/19876914-0-image-a-16_1571391690129.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
