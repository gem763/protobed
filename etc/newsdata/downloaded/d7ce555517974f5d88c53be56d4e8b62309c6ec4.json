He left work to buy a kitchen knife and oyster knife and returned to kill four colleagues and injure two others, slitting the throat of at least one victim. The attack is being investigated as a terrorist incident.\n\nThe attacker, Micka\u00ebl Harpon, who was shot dead at the scene, was a 45-year-old computer expert. He had worked in the police headquarters for more than 15 years and had high-grade security clearance for his job in a section of the police service dedicated to collecting information on jihadist radicalisation.\n\nThe counter-terrorism prosecutor, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ricard, said Harpon had converted to Islam several years ago and adhered to \u201ca radical vision of Islam\u201d. He said Harpon exchanged more than 30 religious text messages with his wife before leaving work to buy the knives, \u201cdisplaying no nervousness\u201d.\n\nPoliticians on the left and right warned of security failings inside the police force and counter-terrorism intelligence, asking how the internal risk from a staff member was not spotted earlier. Many called on the interior minister, Christophe Castaner. to resign.\n\nImmediately after the attack on Thursday, Castaner had announced that the assailant had \u201cnever shown any behavioural problems\u201d and never aroused the \u201cslightest reason for alarm\u201d. The case was initially handled as an ordinary homicide case, before analysis of the assailant\u2019s phones led it to be passed to counter-terrorism police.\n\nBut opposition parties accused the government of failings, saying Harpon had reportedly been mentioned to managers by a staff member four years ago when he appeared to have justified the 2015 attack on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, and that the government had initially seemed unaware of this.\n\nCastaner told French TV on Sunday that there had clearly been \u201cfailings\u201d and they would be investigated. He said that in 2015, two of Harpon\u2019s colleagues had mentioned to staff an altercation they had with him over the Charlie Hebdo attack but that those colleagues had not launched a formal procedure to put a complaint in writing.\n\nPhilippe said procedures for detecting signs that anti-terrorism agents may themselves have been radicalised would be reviewed. He promised two internal reviews on security \u2013 one for the Paris unit where the attack took place and one for all intelligence units across the country.\n\nPhilippe said: \u201cIt\u2019s true there\u2019s no such thing as zero risk, but it\u2019s our responsibility to never accept any eventual failings and to always tighten the net\u201d. He told the Le Journal du Dimanche: \u201cFor all intelligence services, detecting internal threats is an absolute priority and no sign of radicalisation must go unnoticed or without response.\u201d\n\nPhilippe stood by the interior minister Castaner, saying he gave him his full support.\n\nThe Socialist lawmaker S\u00e9bastien Pietrasanta, who has sat on several parliamentary committees on counter-terrorism, said it was \u201cnot sufficient\u201d to carry out internal reviews. He told France info radio there was \u201ca real state of disfunction\u201d inside counter-terrorism services if a radicalised staff member had full security clearance to the heart of sensitive operations. \u201cThere are serious questions to be answered,\u201d he added.\n\nOn the right, Christian Jacob of the opposition party Les R\u00e9publicains said he would on Monday call for a full parliamentary inquiry into the \u201cvery serious\u201d case.\n\nThe counter-terrorism prosecutor on Saturday outlined how Harpon had carried out the attack, which killed three police officers and a police administrator.\n\nHe said Harpon had arrived for work at the police headquarters at 8.58am on Thursday after taking the suburban train near his home in the north-west suburb of Gonesse. At 12.18pm he left the police complex near Notre Dame cathedral and bought a metal kitchen knife with a 20cm blade and an oyster knife.\n\nThe prosecutor, described how \u201cin circumstances to be established \u2026 he mortally wounded with his knife, two victims who were getting ready to go to lunch\u201d. He said that the first victim, a 50-year-old, suffered a large wound to the neck, a second, 38, was fatally stabbed several times around the thorax and abdomen.\n\n\u201cThe autopsies carried out after these deaths show that it was a scene of extreme violence,\u201d he added. \u201cThe attacker then went to another office on the same floor and stabbed a 37-year-old agent several times, two of them fatal. He then tried to go into another office, luckily closed, in which three police staff were having their lunch.\u201d\n\nThe attacker then took the stairs and stabbed a 39-year-old police officer, who died of their wounds. At the ground level he attacked a member of the administrative staff, leaving them with serious but non-fatal wounds to the neck.\n\nIn the prefecture courtyard, he was challenged by a trainee police officer who tried to reason with him telling him to drop his knife and then shot him dead. \u201cThe total length of this killing spree is estimated at seven minutes,\u201d Ricard said.\n\nIn June, a parliamentary report on radicalisation within the public services spoke of 30 suspected cases out of the 150,000 police officers and 130,000 gendarmes in France.", "description": "After fatal attack at police HQ that killed four, government criticised for serious failings", "authors": ["Angelique Chrisafis", "Kim Willsher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dac746e90dfbfce938bf2c13b052fdfca5ddc064/0_261_7843_4706/master/7843.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a194f4fd652595061b4a7e0fbb5f135f", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
