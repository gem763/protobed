REUTERS/Staff\n\nEuropean tech stocks .SX8P were set for their worst day in two weeks, dragged down by chipmakers Infineon (IFXGn.DE), Dialog (DLGS.DE) and STMicroelectronics (STM.MI), as sector proxy Texas Instruments (TXN.O) forecast a 10%-17% drop in current-quarter revenue.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.1% as the Brexit saga hit another snag after British lawmakers rejected Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s timetable.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think the chances of a no-deal Brexit have increased, but the chance of a delay has definitely soured the mood,\u201d said Hubert de Barochez, markets economist at Capital Economics.\n\nEuropean stock markets have been rattled in the past few months by geopolitical concerns, a prolonged U.S.-China trade war and a manufacturing recession in the bloc\u2019s biggest economy, Germany.\n\nAfter solid gains in the first quarter, the benchmark index lost steam in the second and third. It kicked off October with its smallest quarterly increase this year.\n\nWith the focus now squarely on corporate earnings, analysts expect a drop of as much as 5.3% in third-quarter profit, worse than the 3.7% fall expected a week ago, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nHeineken (HEIN.AS) shares lost 2.3% after the world\u2019s second largest brewer said operating profit this year would be at the lower end of its previous forecast.\n\nMining stocks .SXPP were the best performing European sector, lifted by a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly profit at aluminum producer Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL).\n\nAuto stocks .SXAP were up 0.3% as PSA Group (PEUP.PA) rose 2% after sales of its SUVs boosted quarterly revenue.\n\nShares of Covestro AG (1COV.DE) rose 2%, lifting the chemicals sub-sector .SX4P 0.5%, after the German company confirmed its full-year core profit outlook despite challenging global economic conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, Brexit-sensitive FTSE midcap stocks .FTMC slipped 0.2%, underperforming their European peers, but losses were capped as the chances of a no-deal Brexit diminished.", "description": "European shares dipped for the first time this week on Wednesday, as warnings from Texas Instruments raised concerns about the global microchip industry, while UK lawmakers hit the pause button on Britain's exit from the European Union.", "authors": ["Lisa Pauline Mattackal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444024359&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0IB", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
