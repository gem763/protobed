The Cupertino company uses the Chinese internet giant as a Safe Browsing provider, which is also known to have close ties to the Chinese Communist Party\n\nSafari's fraudulent website warning was developed to protect users from online threats by checking every website the smartphone owner visits against a regularly updated list of malicious websites.\n\nApple first relied on a massive database of websites deemed 'blacklisted' by Google's Safe Browsing service, but by its iOS 12.2, the firm had adopted Tencent as its watchdog.\n\nBLOCK THE FEATURE Regardless of whether the safe browsing provider is Google or Tencent, if you're not comfortable with this setting being on by default, you can turn it off by following the steps listed below: iOS: Settings > Safari > Turn off Fraudulent Website Warning macOS: Safari > Preferences > Security > Uncheck Warn when visiting a fraudulent website\n\nHowever, Google is banned from China, which is why some believe Apple is using Tencent to protect its Chinese users, according to ReclaimtheNet, which discovered the data sharing.\n\nMatthew Green, cryptography professor at Johns Hopkins explained that 'Tencent isn't Google.\n\n'While they may be just as trustworthy, we deserve to be informed about this kind of change and to make choices about it.'\n\n'At very least, users should learn about these changes before Apple pushes the feature into production, and thus asks millions of their customers to trust them.'\n\nAlthough many iOS users may not be aware of this process, Apple notes that it can be found in the 'About Safari & Privacy' screen, which is linked via small text under the Privacy & Security section in Settings -> Safari.\n\nAlthough many iOS users may not be aware of this process, Apple notes that it can be found in the 'About Safari & Privacy' screen, which is linked via small text under the Privacy & Security section in Settings -> Safari\n\nAnd the Fraudulent Website Warning feature is also enabled by default, so users aren't likely to know that their IP address may be logged unless they opt to view the information screen.\n\n'This feature appears to be 'on' by default in iOS Safari, meaning that millions of users could potentially be affected,' Said Green.\n\n'In the Safe Browsing change we have another example of Apple making significant modifications to its privacy infrastructure, largely without publicity or announcement.'\n\n'We have learn about this stuff from the fine print.'\n\n'This approach to privacy issues does users around the world a disservice.'\n\nIt has not yet been confirmed or denied if Tencent is collecting IP addresses of just those living in China or if it has reached out beyond the country's boarders.\n\nIt's very much possible Tencent's blacklist is localized to China, where Google's services are blocked, and not elsewhere.\n\nAnd the Fraudulent Website Warning feature is also enabled by default, so users aren't likely to know that their IP address may be logged unless they opt to view the information screen\n\nHowever, this discover is just the icing on the cake, as Apple has been making headlines lately for its practices in the China.\n\nJust last week, Apple was accused of removing the Taiwanese flag from its emoji keyboard for iPhone users in Hong Kong and Macau - both regions are claimed as provinces of China by the country.\n\nUsers in the regions were quick to report that the Taiwanese flag had disappeared from their phones after the recent update to Apple iPhone Software iOS 13.1.1 - despite no change to the emoji keyboard detailed in the update notes.\n\nTaiwan is an independently run democracy. Apple has reportedly 'blocked' the Taiwanese flag for users of its iPhone in mainland China since 2017.\n\nThe allegations come as Hong-Kong continues to experience pro-democracy protests and other corporations are accused of bowing to China's demands in order to keep its large population as a consumer base.\n\nAnd just four days ago, Apple pulled a social and a news app from its online store in relation to anti-government protests in Hong Kong after receiving complaints from China.\n\nThe removed programs included smartphone software that allows Hong Kong activists to track police and a US-based app that reports about the ongoing pro-democracy unrest which has lasted for four months.", "description": "Apple has come under scrutiny for sending IP addresses of its China-based Safari browsers to Tencent, which is a Safe Browsing provider with close ties to the Chinese Communist Party.", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/16/19699862-0-image-a-12_1571068148863.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
