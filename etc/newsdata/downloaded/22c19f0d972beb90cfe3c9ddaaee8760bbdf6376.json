It\u2019s creating a new precinct in Sydney and the prices are being reset accordingly.\"\n\nThe state\u2019s Independent Planning Commission (IPC) this month approved the development application of the last tower of the state significant development, a 30-storey residential and retail building on a 1750sq m site near near the intersection of Hickson Road and Watermans Quay.\n\nAnother view of the Lendlease's three final Barangaroo apartment towers.

Supplied\n\nWith the first two towers, the council was concerned the density of the units and the layout of the towers could lead to \u201cpoorly planned apartments\u201d.\n\nThe council says the \u201cbuilt form\u201d of the last tower will not \"interface well\" with the public domain, leading to increased noise, traffic and parking problems.\n\nThat wasn't the only hurdle.\n\nThe progress of the project had also been impeded by Lendlease and Crown Resorts' two-year joint legal battle against the state\u2019s former Barangaroo Development Authority over blocked views of the Sydney harbour and bridge.\n\nThe government\u2019s deal to build a much taller Barangaroo Central, a separate housing and commercial precinct and the last piece of developable land in Barangaroo, went against agreements with the two companies over the preservation of \u201csight lines\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Lendlease and Crown won the case late last year and NSW\u2019s decision to drop its appeal in early August paved the way for Lendlease to seek approval for the final tower.\n\nGiven backlash to its development from council, all three applications found their way to the IPC.\n\nThe 30-storey building will sit behind the two taller towers at Lendlease's One Sydney Harbour development at Barangaroo. Supplied\n\nThe three towers are now poised to alter Sydney\u2019s skyline and liven its street-level surroundings with new retail activity, energising the area which shares a boundary with historic precinct The Rocks.\n\nThe two taller towers will be connected by a covered, glazed pedestrian link bridge for residents, as well as a pedestrian thoroughfare called the Strada.\n\nThe Strada, which connects Hickson Park and Watermans Cove, will itself be a retail laneway.", "description": "Developer will be able to price new residential precinct  One Sydney Harbour on global, not local, standards.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.7478%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_315/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e7820f046b56d07d7ff2bc6cefa0fb9f3ce39871", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
