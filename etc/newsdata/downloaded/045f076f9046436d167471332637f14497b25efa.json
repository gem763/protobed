(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\n\nHOUSTON (AP) -- Juan Soto is a youngster going deep in the World Series.\n\nSoto's long solo homer in the fifth inning in Game 6 on Tuesday night was his third in the Series, and fifth this postseason.\n\nThe Nationals left fielder, whose 21st birthday was Friday on the same day as Game 3, broke a tie with Miguel Cabrera for the most home runs in a single postseason by a player younger than 22.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSoto will have a chance to add to that since Washington forced a Game 7 with a 7-2 win over the Houston Astros. His homer broke a 2-2 tie and put the Nationals ahead to stay.\n\nCabrera was a 20-year-old rookie for the 2002 World Series champion Marlins when he hit four homers that postseason. But only one of his long balls came in the World Series.\n\nSoto, who also homered in Games 1 and 5, is only the fifth player 22 or younger to hit multiple homers in a World Series. The others were Hall of Famers Mickey Mantle (four) and Jimmie Fox (two), and Tony Kubek (two) and Andruw Jones (two).\n\nLAST ADVANTAGE\n\nThe Houston Astros won 107 games during the regular season to get home field advantage throughout the playoffs.\n\nThey are now heading into Game 7 of the World Series and haven't won at home yet in the Fall Classic.\n\nTheir three-game losing streak at Minute Maid Park matches their longest at home this year - the Astros also lost three in a row from Sept. 10-12. They had a nine-game home losing streak in 2018.\n\nFULL FIVE\n\nThe Nationals are the first team to use five different starters in the World Series since the Philadelphia Phillies in 1980.\n\nThat hadn't been the plan for Washington until Game 1 starter Scherzer had to be scratched from Game 5 and Joe Ross started instead. Stephen Strasburg, Anibal Sanchez and Patrick Corbin also started in this series for Washington.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs for those 1980 Phillies, who beat the Kansas City Royals in six games, their five starters were Bob Walk, Steve Carlton, Dick Ruthven, Larry Christenson and Marty Bystrom.\n\nSTAYING DRY\n\nThe roof at Minute Maid Park would have been closed anyway, but it's a good thing the home park of the Astros does have that retractable dome overhead.\n\nIt was raining Tuesday in Houston, and wet weather would have had an impact on batting practice and pregame activities.\n\nOn Wednesday, when Game 7 will be played, the forecast calls for widespread rain and thunderstorms throughout the day and into the night.\n\n---\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports", "description": "Juan Soto is a youngster going deep in the World Series.
