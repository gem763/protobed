His office is charged with investigating allegations of ethical misconduct concerning District government employees and officials \u2014 including the mayor and the D.C. Council, as well as about 34,000 city workers. Five board members appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the council vote on how to resolve cases and can levy civil penalties including fines.\n\nAD\n\nThe whistleblower complaint was related to the Housing Production Trust Fund, the city\u2019s primary tool for financing affordable-housing projects.\n\nA high-ranking official at the D.C. Department of Housing and Community Development, the agency overseeing the trust fund, alleged that the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development directed the housing agency to steer funding to a project linked to a developer who used to work with the deputy mayor.\n\nAD\n\nThe complaint, obtained by The Washington Post, had no specific evidence of political favoritism and based the allegations on statements from a housing official suggesting the city had no choice but to fund the project.\n\nThe housing agency official first contacted the ethics agency on June 14, 2018, the day after the administration of Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) announced the project was one of nine selected for affordable-housing grants.\n\nAD\n\nBut the ethics agency did not follow up on the complaint, and the whistleblower contacted the auditor\u2019s office in February.\n\nThe auditor\u2019s office released a report in May that found five of the nine developers that won funding ranked in the bottom half of the applicants and included the two lowest-scoring proposals.\n\nAD\n\nCity officials said they had valid reasons for making those selections, including an unexpected availability of housing vouchers changing the feasibility of certain projects. The audit did not find evidence of political pressure.\n\nD.C. lawmakers fail to halt contract for developer under auditor scrutiny\n\nThe audit was performed at the request of D.C. Council member Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), who chairs the committee that oversees the ethics board.\n\nAccording to emails reviewed by the auditor\u2019s office, the ethics board did not investigate the whistleblower complaint after it was made and did not assign a tracking number to the case.\n\nAD\n\nWolfingbarger told a council staffer in February he would circle back with the whistleblower but did not, the audit says.\n\nAD\n\nAfter the auditor\u2019s office released its own report on the allegations, Wolfingbarger told board members in June that he was waiting for the city inspector general\u2019s office to complete its review. The next month, he told board members he launched a preliminary investigation once he confirmed the inspector general was no longer handling the case.\n\nBut the inspector general had already referred the case to the ethics board more than a year earlier, the audit found.\n\nEthics board fines Jack Evans $20,000 in outside employment case\n\nIn a written response Tuesday to the audit, Wolfingbarger said that he did not remember that referral when he briefed the ethics board and that it did not come up when he searched for emails related to the case before the meeting. He objected to Patterson calling his comments \u201cmisrepresentations.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWolfingbarger also acknowledged the agency\u2019s failure to create a tracking number.\n\n\u201cAlthough we cannot make amends for the lengthy delay between the time we originally received the whistleblower\u2019s Complaint and when we actually opened an investigation into [the whistleblower\u2019s] allegations, we have begun to investigate this matter to determine what actually took place and whether any violations of the Code of Conduct occurred in the course of those events,\u201d Wolfingbarger wrote.\n\nNorma B. Hutcheson, the chairwoman of the ethics board, acknowledged the agency mishandled the whistleblower complaint but said the situation was an \u201caberration and not the part of a pattern or the norm.\u201d She also said she didn\u2019t believe Wolfingbarger meant to mislead the board with his comments about the inspector general\u2019s role in investigating the manner.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhile the mishandling of the Complaint was an unfortunate oversight, it is one that the Board is resolved to correct given the importance of BEGA\u2019s mission,\u201d Hutcheson said in a prepared statement.\n\nAllen declined to immediately comment, saying he needed to first read the audit.\n\nThe city ethics board was created earlier in the decade in the aftermath of federal convictions of multiple council members.\n\nSome lawmakers have questioned whether the agency has been effective.\n\nThe board sidelined an ethics investigation of D.C. Council member Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) and the nexus between his private consulting work and actions as a public official. It cited the ongoing federal investigation of Evans, even though several other entities have been able to conduct their own probes of Evans. The board did fine Evans $20,000 for using government resources and touting his influence as an elected official while soliciting employment from local law firms.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe board also concluded that former D.C. Public Schools chancellor Antwan Wilson violated ethics policies and reprimanded him \u2014 more than a year after he had resigned under pressure.\n\n\u201cBEGA is supposed to be our watchdog and a safe harbor for employees who want to report wrongdoing,\u201d said D.C. Council member Elissa Silverman (I-At Large). \u201cThis is more evidence that BEGA is not fulfilling its mission.\u201d\n\nCapital One Arena teams up with British company to launch sports betting\n\nD.C. regulatory employee accused of dealing fentanyl outside government office\n\nWhy a D.C. lawmaker votes on his own discipline\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The whistleblower alleged a D.C. agency steered millions to a developer with political connections.", "authors": ["Fenit Nirappil", "Reporter Covering D.C.
