It was a moment to listen and feel their emotions,' he said.\n\nMarco Silva says he understands why Everton fans are angry after club's defeat by Burnley\n\nThe Toffees' 1-0 defeat at Turf Moor was their fourth straight Premier League defeat\n\n'The fans deserve our respect. They have a right to be angry, no doubt. They will keep supporting us but if you are asking if they should be angry with the team and myself, then of course, that is normal.\n\n'In the last four games we didn't get the results and they have all the reasons to be angry with us. It is up to us to work harder, to be braver, to be more clinical and for our attacking players need to be more aggressive and assertive in these type of games.\n\n'I understand 100 per cent why the supporters are angry.'\n\nMany fans called on Everton director of football Marcel Brands to sack Silva as he walked past them on his way to the dressing-room area.\n\nOnly half of Everton's team walked over to acknowledged the away support after the final whistle but Silva was reluctant to harshly criticise those who didn't. 'It is a difficult moment for them (the players) as well,' he said.", "description": "Everton's beleaguered manager Marco Silva admitted it was", "authors": ["Joe Bernstein For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/21/19342290-0-image-a-87_1570307472855.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
