Data on campaign spending from the Federal Election Commission shows how much money is spent on each of the platforms. Google and Facebook easily outpace Twitter. In recent cycles, Facebook has surpassed Google, in part on the strength of its campaign-focused tools. (We included Snapchat out of curiosity; it\u2019s a distant fourth.)\n\n(Those numbers exclude advertising that might have been purchased through contractors, such as political consulting firms.)\n\nThe difference is even more dramatic if you look at cumulative spending since the dawn of the social media era, the 2008 election. Campaigns have spent $46 million on Facebook (and Instagram) and $30 million on Google (and AdSense). They\u2019ve spent less than $2 million on Twitter.\n\nThere have been about 64,000 Facebook transactions by campaigns and 34,000 Google ones. Twitter comes in at 2,600.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s important context for considering Twitter\u2019s announcement Wednesday. Jack Dorsey, the company\u2019s CEO, used his platform to tell the world that political ads would no longer be welcome on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally. We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought. Why? A few reasons,\u201d he wrote. Among them? \u201cWhile internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions.\u201d\n\nHe took a moment to troll Facebook, which in recent days has been criticized for allowing false statements in political ads.\n\nAD\n\nFor instance, it\u2018s not credible for us to say: \u201cWe\u2019re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad\u2026well...they can say whatever they want! \ud83d\ude09\u201d \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nThe announcement was not made without self-awareness, with Dorsey adding that he was \u201cwell aware we\u2019re a small part of a much larger political advertising ecosystem.\u201d A final policy, he said, would come in the middle of next month.\n\nAD\n\nWhat will be more interesting to watch once that policy is released is how Twitter will handle issue advertising. Issue ads have been a loophole in political spending for years, with political groups often forming tax-exempt 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) groups to avoid campaign contribution and spending limits. There are rules guiding that spending, but they are lax enough to make issues advertising both common and contentious.\n\nDorsey addressed those ads, too.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe considered stopping only candidate ads, but issue ads present a way to circumvent,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAdditionally, it isn\u2019t fair for everyone but candidates to buy ads for issues they want to push. So we\u2019re stopping these too.\u201d\n\nThis is a tricky position to take. Figuring out when a campaign is spending money is relatively straightforward (though not always trivial). Figuring out what constitutes an inappropriate political issue campaign is much trickier.\n\nAD\n\nAn ad from House candidate Joe Smith would be banned. An ad from Citizens for Green Space that touts Smith\u2019s record on creating Municipal Park is a bit murkier but still pretty clear. But what about an ad from the Westside Neighborhood Association inviting people to come out to an event at beautiful Municipal Park, which is a central part of Smith\u2019s campaign pitch? The line gets quite blurry, quite fast.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s the sort of can of worms that makes social media platforms wary of new efforts to police content. Now Twitter and Dorsey have cracked the can\u2019s lid \u2014 and we\u2019ll have to see how far back they\u2019ll peel it, if you\u2019ll forgive the extended metaphor.\n\nFor now, though, Twitter can enjoy one (obviously intended) effect of its announcement: digging at and emphasizing Facebook\u2019s travails while giving up a relatively small piece of its own business.\n\nAD", "description": "But that's not the most important news.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-amYP9E6unhKwqib6F4U1Igbewk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ND6RKDX3KMI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
