I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service,\" the president continued, adding that he will name a new national security adviser sometime next week.\n\nBut Bolton, who was scheduled to appear at a White House briefing later Tuesday afternoon alongside Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, offered a conflicting account on Twitter minutes after the Trump's posts.\n\nBolton's departure follows a series of foreign policy schisms between the hawkish former United Nations envoy and the commander in chief \u2014 who has sought to deescalate tensions with Iran and North Korea while Bolton pursued a more confrontational tack toward the U.S. adversaries. Recent reports have also indicated Bolton has been largely sidelined in White House talks seeking to navigate an end to the war in Afghanistan.\n\nBolton, who served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations for 16 months under former President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, was appointed as Trump\u2019s top national security aide in April 2018 \u2014 despite widespread opposition from national Democrats and concern among several high-profile members of the diplomatic community over his perceived proclivity for military intervention and role in the origins of the Iraq War.\n\n\"I offered to resign last night and President Trump said, 'Let's talk about it tomorrow,'\" he wrote online.\n\nBolton is the third national security adviser of Trump\u2019s presidency. He assumed leadership of the administration\u2019s National Security Council following the March 2018 ouster of H. R. McMaster, the Army lieutenant general who frequently clashed with the president on matters of foreign policy and was branded by detractors as not sufficiently conservative.\n\nTrump\u2019s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, became ensnared in former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, and pleaded guilty in December 2017 to one felony count of lying to the FBI about conversations he had with Russia\u2019s ambassador.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "description": "\u2018I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions,\u2019 US president tweeted.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko", "Rym Momtaz"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1140294002-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
