A deadly fire at the Moria refugee camp on Lesbos on Sept. 29 triggered riots at the site, which is at 400% capacity.\n\nThe Greek government promised to accelerate transfers to the mainland and expand the network of camps there. But those transfers have so far been outnumbered by new arrivals on the islands.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International has described Moria as \"overcrowded and unsafe\" and urged other European Union countries to help Greece settle asylum-seekers.\n\nIn this early Thursday, Sept. 26, 2019 photo, an Iraqi girl is wrapped in a thermal blanket after being transferred from a dinghy onto a Greek coast guard patrol boat during a rescue operation near the eastern Aegean Sea island of Samos.

(AP Photo/Petros Giannakouris)\n\nAuthorities fear that if the arrival numbers remain high through October, a winter crisis will be difficult to avoid.\n\nGreece's new conservative government says it also plans to detain migrants without the right to request asylum and wants to resume deportations back to Turkey under terms detailed in the 2016 EU-Turkey deal.\n\n___\n\nFollow Petros at https://twitter.com/PGiannakouris\n\nIn this early Thursday, Sept. 26, 2019 photo, refugees and migrants in a dinghy are lit by a a Greek coast guard patrol boat's spotlight during a rescue operation near the eastern Aegean Sea island of Samos.
