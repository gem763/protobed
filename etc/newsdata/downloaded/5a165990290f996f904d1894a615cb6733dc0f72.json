It was also a public relations disaster, resulting in an embarrassing hearing before the U.S. Congress.\n\nMississippi-born Dudley took charge of the company\u2019s Gulf Restoration Project before replacing then-chief executive Tony Hayward on Oct. 1, 2010, less than six months after the disaster.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDudley was well-prepared for the corporate tumult after serving five years as president and chief executive of TNK-BP, which was BP\u2019s lucrative oil partnership in Russia. Dudley fled Russia in 2008 after being harassed by Russian authorities. He reportedly escaped before he was to be arrested.\n\nBP recovered under Dudley\u2019s nine years as chief executive. The company produces more than 1.2 million barrels of oil per day from its far-flung operations and is projected to earn more than $10 billion in profit this year on $300 billion in revenue.\n\nThe London-based oil giant is one of the largest companies in the world, with more than 5 billion barrels of proven oil reserves. It employs 73,000.\n\n\u201cBernard Looney comes very well prepared for the new energy era ahead, with deep understanding of both BP and the industry, and with experience working in very different circumstances around the world,\u201d Yergin said.\n\nAD", "description": "Dudley, 64, will retire as group chief executive and relinquish his membership on the company\u2019s board on March 31, 2020, the company said.", "authors": ["Thomas Heath", "Local Business Reporter", "Columnist", "Writing About Entrepreneurs", "Companies In The Washington Metropolitan Area"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UrTHGL4_oRCfI8ho37iXHoBqrIo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PMZ5BFXGQYI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
