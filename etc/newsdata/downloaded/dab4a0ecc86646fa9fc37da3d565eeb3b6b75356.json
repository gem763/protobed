His fingers fly over the keyboard of his phone like Charlie Parker burning up the tenor saxophone. But imagine Bird sitting in with a high school band: He must take every solo.\n\nThat\u2019s been Trump\u2019s burden, until lately.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, the president plays the national media like a fiddle, like a Steinway, like Prince played his Cloud Guitar. He drives the conversation like Max Roach on drums, driving \u201cA Night in Tunisia.\u201d Even Mother Nature wailing the blues can\u2019t compete with Trump for attention. She parks a Category 5 hurricane over a Caribbean archipelago, reducing a city to sticks, leaving whole neighborhoods dimly visible like wraiths beneath the floodwaters and littering the streets with corpses. Trump changes the music with a flourish of his Sharpie.\n\nEven so, this virtuoso performance of media ma\u00adnipu\u00adla\u00adtion \u2014 shifting the subject from death and destruction and suffering to an argument over weather forecasts for coastal Alabama \u2014 could last only so long, right? Just when it seemed time for the next Trump improvisation, however, his band stepped up to play.\n\nA couple of political appointees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, pitched in by chastising the forecasters who had the temerity to dispute Trump\u2019s daffy storm warning. This kept the groove going through the weekend. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross took the next turn out front, after news leaked that he threatened to fire meteorologists who refused to play in the president\u2019s key.\n\nA veteran of past presidential administrations once explained to me that every White House struggles to communicate its mission to the sprawling federal bureaucracy. Presidents must be so clear about their principles that staff members who might never set foot in the Oval Office still have a strong sense of the leader\u2019s priorities. The Hurricane Dorian distraction suggests that Trump\u2019s people are figuring him out. They\u2019re coming to understand that the president\u2019s principles boil down to control of the news. By riffing madly, Trump fixates the audience, makes himself omnipresent and coaxes journalists into looking like fools.\n\n(I choose that last phrase with care. We\u2019re not as foolish as Trump makes us appear. Yet there we were, as Bahamians were starving, giving valuable bandwidth to the ludicrous idea that the president might be in legal jeopardy for drawing on an official map.)\n\nHis minions are realizing it\u2019s easy to please the president. Just follow his lead, amp up the crazy, and keep the distractions coming.\n\nConsider campaign manager Brad Parscale, another example of a soloing sideman. At the GOP state convention in California recently, Parscale laid down a provocative theme: \u201cThe Trumps will be a dynasty that lasts for decades.\u201d To reporters after his speech, he offered variations on the theme: \u201cI just think they\u2019re a dynasty. I think they\u2019re all amazing people . . . with amazing capabilities,\u201d Parscale tootled. \u201cI think you see that from Don Jr. I think you see that from Ivanka. You see it from Jared.\u201d\n\nThis clever concoction of despotism and celebrity worship \u2014 with a dash of \u201cSuccession\u201d mixed in \u2014 was exquisitely calculated to set the media humming and timed perfectly to amplify an Atlantic cover story on the purported rivalry among Trump offspring to assume their father\u2019s mantle. Nothing like palace intrigue to distract the populace.\n\nKen Cuccinelli, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, stood for a solo recently when asked to square new restrictions with the words inscribed on the Statue of Liberty. Poet Emma Lazarus famously wrote: \u201cGive me your tired, your poor / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore / Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me.\u201d But what she meant, Cuccinelli offered, was a limited invitation to those \u201cwho can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge.\u201d\n\nCuccinelli\u2019s ability and willingness to say this with a straight face were positively Trump-like.\n\n\u201cPolitics\u201d hasn\u2019t always been a dirty word. It is rooted in the Greek idea of the \u201cpolis\u201d \u2014 a community organized around certain rules and customs for life together. Serious, important business. But for Donald Trump and his simpatico hirelings, politics is an entertainment channel, and power lies in controlling the programming. What strikes his followers as comedy (watch the clumsy reporters chase the elusive Sharpie!) strikes his critics as a horror or a freak show. Either way, they\u2019re transfixed.\n\nAnd the band plays on. And will continue playing until the country at last tires of dancing to this tune.\n\nRead more from David Von Drehle\u2019s archive.", "description": "He\u2019s no longer a one-man band.
