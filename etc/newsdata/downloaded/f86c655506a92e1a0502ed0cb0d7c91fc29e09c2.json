That was the gameplan implemented by Frank Mir on Friday night.\n\nThe former UFC champion Mir (19-13 MMA, 1-2 BMMA) peppered the inside lead leg of opponent Roy Nelson (23-18 MMA, 1-4 BMMA) in their Bellator 231 headlining bout.\n\nAs the fight progressed, the inside of Nelson lead left leg became more and more red. Mir\u2019s leg kicks knocked Nelson off balance numerous times, but \u201cBig Country\u201d kept on trucking. Mir would win the bout via unanimous decision.\n\nDuring the Bellator 231 broadcast, commentator Chael Sonnen claimed UFC contender Francis Ngannou injured Nelson in the weeks leading up to the belt. \u201cThe American Gangster\u201d alleged Nelson\u2019s team was concerned rumors would start to build and sweep across the Las Vegas MMA community. As a result of the kick-heavy attack, Sonnen questioned if Mir had heard those rumors.\n\nWhen asked at a post-fight press conference after Friday\u2019s event, Mir confirmed that he did indeed hear those rumors but brushed them off as hearsay.\n\n\u201cIf he was injured and he took that many leg kicks, then holy cow that guy wins the iron leg award,\u201d Mir said. \u201cYou hear all kinds of things in camps back-and-forth.\u201d\n\nRumors swirl during fight camps, according to Mir. When he heard his opponent injured the leg matching his power hand, red flags sprung up. It could have been a potential trick.\n\n\u201cSomeone told me that, but I was like, \u2018Ehhh, I\u2019m not falling for that,'\u201d Mir said. \u201cEspecially when they said it was his right leg, which is what I think I heard was injured. So then I was like, \u2018Well, that\u2019s not going to help me out. I\u2019m a southpaw. How am I going to get to his right leg?'\u201d\n\nBy defeating Nelson, Mir not only snapped a four-fight win streak but also picked up his first win with the promotion. Conversely, Nelson lost his fourth fight in a row.\n\nBellator 231 took place Friday at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn.
