Velasco reportedly served as an intermediary between Piedrahita-Ceballos and Ciccione. The events took place in late 2010 and early 2011.\n\nAs part of his efforts to help Piedrahita-Ceballos, Ciccione misled the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, HIS management, and altered records to secure the dismissal. He also falsified the concurrence of other federal agents and attempted to obtain entry for Piedrahita-Ceballos into the U.S., the DOJ said.\n\nMEXICAN DRUG CARTELS FUELING METH COMEBACK IN US, WITH SEIZURES AT \u2018HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS\u2019\n\nPiedrahita-Ceballos pleaded guilty to bribery in May.
