Just a few weeks later, though, the new Fortnite island is already starting to change. Things are getting spooky.\n\nThe battle royale game has been updated for Halloween with an event developer Epic calls \u201cFortnitemares.\u201d Once again, parts of the map have become overrun with hordes of undead. This time, though, the monsters are spawning from a very specific location. A small island at the center of the Fortnite map is now dubbed the Isle of the Storm, and it\u2019s covered with giant purple crystals. Each has writhing tentacles, which will produce zombies until you destroy them. It\u2019s the first significant change to the new island, and just like last year, it adds a fun new element to the game.\n\nAlong with the monsters comes a new game mode: a squad-based battle where players have to team up to take down a massive creature called the Storm King, all while dealing with waves of undead. It\u2019s an exhausting experience, but it at least comes with some nice rewards, including huge XP boosts and a nice dark crystal umbrella. (There are also plenty of Halloween cosmetics to purchase, and a number of existing skins have been given new spooky options for free.)\n\nFortnitemares will run until November 4th, so you have until then to unlock all of the rewards. After it\u2019s over, the currently zombified island will likely return to normal \u2014 though this event shows that Epic is still open to changing up its new island, even in the wake of the infamous black hole.", "description": "Just in time for Halloween, Epic has launched Fortnitemares, an event in which zombies invade the Fortnite island.
