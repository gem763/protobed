The company will continue to operate its website and hundreds of brick and mortar shops across American shopping malls.\n\nChang told the Times that the company faced rapid expansion \u2014 opening stores in 47 countries in less than six years \u2014 that contributed to a lot of \"complexity\" with their business model. She added that changes to the retail industry, including the rise of e-commerce, challenged the business.\n\n\"The retail industry is obviously changing,\" she told the Times. \"There has been a softening of mall traffic and sales are shifting more to online.\"\n\nThe announcement comes after reports that Forever 21 had hired a team of advisers to seek out private equity support to refinance and restructure the beleaguered brand. However, efforts to do so proved futile, thanks in part to ongoing disagreements between store landlords and company leadership, including cofounder Do Won Chang, who has insisted on maintaining a controlling stake in the company, Bloomberg reported.\n\nRead more: We shopped at Forever 21 and H&M and saw firsthand why one store is clearly outperforming the other\n\nAs a privately held company, Forever 21 \u2014 which currently has more than 800 stores across the US, Europe, Asia and Latin America \u2014 does not publicly disclose sales, though it's estimated to bring in $3 billion annually. However, the company has shown significant signs of struggle over the past few years, including store closures in international markets like London and China and an overstocked product assortment.\n\nSources close to the matter told Bloomberg that \"a bankruptcy filing would help the company shed unprofitable stores and recapitalize the business.\"\n\nForever 21 was founded in 1984 and rose to prominence in the 1990s and early aughts for its low-priced, stylish offerings that were particularly popular among young women. The company took a hit in recent years thanks to increased competition from trendy e-commerce companies like Revolve, as well as the rise of direct-to-consumer companies that have redirected shoppers away from malls.", "description": "Linda Chang, the company's executive vice president, told the New York Times that the retailer would soon cease operations in 40 countries.", "authors": ["Rosie Perper", "Bethany Biron"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cf64b4611e20535f46b742b-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
