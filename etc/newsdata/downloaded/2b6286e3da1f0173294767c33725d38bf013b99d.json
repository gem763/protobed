Some Republicans like Tucker Carlson and Rob Portman have settled on the view that what Trump did with Ukraine is bad \u2014 but not impeachable. That\u2019s a smart position to stake out early in the process since it attempts to remove the subject from the realm of facts to the realm of law, where matters are much less uncertain. After all, Democrats could turn up damning evidence of Trump\u2019s conduct. Imagine Gordon Sondland testifying that the president was worried about Joe Biden beating him next fall and told him that the Burisma investigation would help avert that. If the GOP concedes the Democrats\u2019 point that this is an impeachable offense if it\u2019s proved then Trump\u2019s fate is in Adam Schiff\u2019s hands.\n\nThe safer play is to say, \u201cYes, yes, Trump behaved inappropriately in asking Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate the Bidens but that\u2019s just not enough of a crime to justify removing a sitting president from office. Scold him, censure him, but let the voters issue a verdict on his job.\u201d Taking that position renders the Democratic investigation largely moot (although if they can prove Trump intended a quid pro quo, that would change the game) and leaves Trump\u2019s fate in Senate Republicans\u2019 hands. It doesn\u2019t matter what facts Pelosi and Schiff produce; we don\u2019t execute people for speeding and we don\u2019t oust presidents over petty nonsense like trying to influence the coming election by jumpstarting a foreign probe of the then-frontrunner from the other party.\n\nThat\u2019s the strategy Lindsey Graham endorsed this morning on Fox, more or less. The difference is that Graham, as Trump\u2019s foremost apologist in the Senate, won\u2019t even concede that the call with Zelensky was inappropriate. Carlson and Portman are happy to do that knowing that it doesn\u2019t really matter and, if anything, might mollify Trump critics a bit to see members of his own party criticizing him (mildly) for something they\u2019re angry about. Graham can\u2019t even be bothered. Portman can adopt the \u201cbad but not impeachable\u201d line on this if he likes; Graham\u2019s taking the \u201cnot bad and therefore certainly not impeachable\u201d approach instead. And he wants his colleagues in the Senate to tell Pelosi that right now.\n\nGraham plans to have Senate Republicans sign a letter calling Ukraine call not worthy of impeachment pic.twitter.com/MtkrELR89Y \u2014 TPM Livewire (@TPMLiveWire) October 9, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s clever inasmuch as a letter like that would operate a bit like a judicial order granting a motion to dismiss before a trial takes place. Graham is accusing the Democrats of failing to state a claim. Instead of waiting around for them to impeach, why not let them know up front that the Senate sees nothing actionable here? Maybe it\u2019ll convince Pelosi not to bother with impeachment. (Highly unlikely.) Maybe it\u2019ll be a morale booster to Republican voters who are worried about what Trump might be guilty of. (More likely.) Maybe it\u2019ll provide a pretext for McConnell to hold a truncated/expedited trial after Trump is impeached, since Republican \u201cjurors\u201d will already be on record as saying that no high crime or misdemeanor was committed as a matter of law. (Likely.)\n\nNot everyone in the Senate will sign such a letter, of course. Romney won\u2019t. Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, and Ben Sasse won\u2019t. Various Republicans for various reasons will want to communicate to voters that they\u2019re troubled by what Trump is accused of and are determined to let all the facts come out before reaching a conclusion. Call that the \u201cnominally undecided\u201d group. The next group, Portman\u2019s \u201cbad but not impeachable\u201d faction, might not sign such a letter either. Obviously they disagree with Graham that Trump did nothing wrong. And even if he drafted the letter to avoid the question of whether Trump behaved appropriately or not and focused instead on whether there\u2019s an impeachable offense here, Portman probably still wouldn\u2019t sign it. He\u2019s worried enough about the politics of this issue to have made a point of saying that what Trump did is bad. He won\u2019t want to leap head-first into a GOP effort to prejudge the Democratic impeachment articles by insisting that there\u2019s no crime even in a worst-case scenario.\n\nAll Graham needs to settle this matter, though, is 33 other Republicans to join him. If 34 GOPers in the chamber out of 53 are willing to commit to the position that nothing Trump did or conceivably could have done is impeachable then the impeachment and removal effort is officially doomed. Are there 33 other Republicans who are so cowed by Trump and his voters that they\u2019d be willing to take that position right now?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t rule it out.\n\nI assume Graham\u2019s letter idea is being coordinated with the White House, in which case it\u2019s part of a two-pronged strategy. The first prong is to make the case aggressively that the Democratic inquiry is a sham; it\u2019s unfair, it\u2019s an affront to due process, therefore any facts it produces are inherently suspect. That was the thrust of Pat Cipollone\u2019s letter last night. Cipollone is playing offense. Graham\u2019s letter would be playing defense, trying to frame the terms of the debate for the coming impeachment trial in the Senate. It doesn\u2019t matter which facts the Democrats\u2019 sham inquiry produced. There\u2019s simply no crime here. Case dismissed.\n\nThe absolute best part of the clip, by the way, is the bit at the end when Graham exhorts Fox viewers to pray for the Kurds, as if they\u2019re at risk of being victimized by a hurricane or some other disastrous natural force which America is powerless to influence. He took a similarly dubious view in a tweet this morning when he asked people to \u201cPray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration.\u201d The Trump administration? I\u2019ve only heard of one person within \u201cthe Trump Administration\u201d who supports the decision to bug out of northern Syria as Turkey prepares to immolate American allies. It\u2019s interesting, if not at all surprising, that Lindsey refuses to name that person.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how able he is to compartmentalize his disgust at Trump\u2019s Syria policy with his zeal in defending Trump on impeachment, frankly. They\u2019re two distinct matters, granted, but politicians use leverage they have over one matter to exact concessions on unrelated matters all the time. Pundits keep warning that Trump is playing with fire by antagonizing Senate Republicans on Syria at the very moment that they\u2019re about to take his fate in their hands on impeachment, but is he really playing with fire? Graham is heartbroken about abandoning the Kurds and yet here he is on Fox trying to blow up the impeachment effort on the president\u2019s behalf before it even reaches the Senate. With ass-kissing like this, why should Trump feel pressure to throw the Senate GOP a bone on foreign policy?", "description": "Motion to dismiss.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
