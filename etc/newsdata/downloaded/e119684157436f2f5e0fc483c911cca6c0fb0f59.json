Maxine Waters, D-Los Angeles, chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee. She demanded Facebook stop work on Libra until the company addresses a series of unrelated \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in its social-media business.\n\n\u201cYou have opened up a serious discussion about whether Facebook should be broken up,\u201d Waters said.\n\nNo one is above the law including Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook has allowed election interference, released private data, violated civil rights laws, among other offenses & now they\u2019re trying to launch a #BigTechTakover by creating this mysterious #ZuckBuck? Not on my watch! @FSCDems \u2014 Maxine Waters (@RepMaxineWaters) October 23, 2019\n\nWhen pressed why several high-profile members of the Libra Association -- Visa Inc. V, +0.37% , Mastercard Inc. MA, -0.18% , PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL, -1.53% , eBay Inc. EBAY, +0.01% , and Unicorn Stripe -- have abandoned the project, Zuckerberg could only muster that it was possibly because Libra is a \u201crisky\u201d project.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s testimony follows the July congressional grilling of David Marcus, the executive in charge of Libra, whom lawmakers dinged for vague answers.\n\nRead more: Facebook\u2019s Libra cryptocurrency project gets blistering reception from Senate\n\nThe acrimony on Wednesday ran deep and cynically despite Facebook\u2019s disclosure late Monday that it has spent $12.3 million so far this year to influence U.S. lawmakers and regulators \u2014 nearly equal to the $12.6 million it contributed to lobbying efforts in 2018.\n\nRead more: Facebook discloses record lobbying spending as Zuckerberg braces for House hearing", "description": "Between skepticism about Facebook Inc.\u2019s ability to safeguard against election fraud to outright skepticism over its cryptocurrency project Libra, the...", "authors": ["Jon Swartz", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT850_Zuck_ZG_20191023102419.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
