I believe that with hard work, we can make the next debate in Atlanta. We have about three and a half weeks to do that. So I\u2019m going to keep working hard to get there,\u201d he said.\n\nCastro\u2019s comments stand in contrast to his dire warning to supporters in a fundraising email late last week.\n\n\"I don\u2019t say this lightly: If I don\u2019t make the next debate stage, it will be the end of my campaign,\" Castro emphasized.\n\nFOX NEWS' BRETT BAIER ON DEBATE WINNERS AND LOSERS\n\nTo date, eight candidates say they\u2019ve qualified: They are \u2013 in alphabetical order \u2013 are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, businessman and progressive and environmental advocate Tom Steyer, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.\n\nAfter the debate, it was hard to find a political pundit who praised Castro\u2019s performance.\n\nBut asked by Fox News if his debate performance helped him in his goal to make the next debate stage, the candidate said, \u201cI think so. It\u2019s always a scramble for time with 12 people up there but I made the best use of the time that I did get. I was very sharp on issues that people care about and I think that will make a difference.\u201d\n\nAnd he touted on Twitter that \u201cdonations are coming in from all around the country.\u201d\n\nCastro also took aim at the media hosts for the debate - CNN and the New York Times \u2013 telling reporters in the spin room and highlighting on Twitter that there were \u201cthree hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration. Climate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border.\u201d", "description": "If anyone needed a big night at the fourth round Democratic nomination debate \u2013 it was Julian Castro.
