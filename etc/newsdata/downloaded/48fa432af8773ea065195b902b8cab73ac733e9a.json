(Mypurgatoryyears/(iStock))\n\nA first-of-its-kind peanut allergy therapy will be scrutinized Friday by advisers to the Food and Drug Administration, who will assess whether the drug\u2019s ability to desensitize children to potentially life-threatening allergies outweighs its side effects. If approved, it would be the first of what\u2019s expected to be a wave of new food allergy drugs that prevent a reaction, rather than simply treat one after the fact.\n\nAfter a year of treatment with the drug, Palforzia, most children in a large trial were able to tolerate the equivalent of two peanuts. But the drug caused a number of side effects \u2014 including an increase in allergic reactions and in the need for injections of epinephrine with a pen device to quell systemic responses. The therapy is not a cure; people will still need to avoid peanuts and carry emergency medication.\n\nPalforzia, which is made by biotech company Aimmune Therapeutics, is aimed at reducing reactions when people are inadvertently exposed to peanuts, for example when eating a food that has been cross-contaminated. The company is seeking approval for administering the drug to children ages 4 to 17.\n\n\u201cFor a family with high anxiety and a significant burden of anxiety and fear from living with peanut allergy, this might give that extra buffer of safety,\u201d said Marcus Shaker, a pediatric allergist at Dartmouth\u2019s Geisel School of Medicine, who was not involved with the trial. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to need to strictly avoid peanuts, but [this will help] to let go of some of the fear they may have.\u201d\n\n[New treatments for peanut allergies sound promising, but questions remain]\n\nThe committee\u2019s deliberations will be closely watched, not only because it represents the first treatment for peanut allergy but also because the therapy \u2014 essentially a capsule of pharmaceutical grade peanut protein \u2014 is expected to be the first in a new generation of food allergy therapies that work by gradually increasing people\u2019s exposure to the allergen. The advisory committee\u2019s recommendation will guide the agency\u2019s decision on whether to approve the treatment, but is not binding.\n\nDespite the excitement, allergists said the treatment may not be appropriate for every patient. Treatment requires repeated office visits and regularly taking a drug that can trigger, in the short term, the very side effects it is aimed at preventing.\n\nIn a large trial of 551 people, including 496 children, one in 10 of the people who received the drug dropped out because of adverse events, which included abdominal pain, vomiting and systemic allergic reactions. In that trial, 14 percent of patients taking the drug had to use an epinephrine pen to quell a severe reaction \u2014 more than twice the rate of those taking a placebo.\n\n\u201cI think it may not be for every patient with peanut allergy. What I will be doing, and many of us as allergists will be doing, is having careful conversations with our patients about whether this is something they\u2019re even interested in doing,\u201d said Hemant Sharma, chief of the division of allergy and immunology at Children\u2019s National Medical Center, who was involved in the trial.\n\nShaker said that it remains to be seen whether patients will accept the increased allergic reactions for the protection it confers against accidental exposure.\n\n\u201cI think we need more data on what it\u2019s going to mean to patients and how it\u2019s going to change their level of risk perception and change their quality of life,\u201d Shaker said. He said the drug is \u201ca little bittersweet for everybody. Everyone\u2019s happy to see something happening, and yet it\u2019s not what we asked for from Santa Claus.\u201d\n\nSome physicians already use escalating doses of inexpensive peanut flour to desensitize allergies, but federal approval of a drug would probably be covered by insurance and expand the use of the approach. Aimmune scientists say that an approved drug will also eliminate uncertainties about dosing that exist when using off-the-shelf peanut flour.\n\nSteve Tilles, senior director of medical affairs at Aimmune, said that it is not yet known how long people will need to stay on the drug, but he is hopeful that after a few years of treatment, people could discontinue the medication while remaining desensitized to peanuts.\n\nAimmune is also working on a therapy for egg allergies and tree nuts. Other researchers are working on a skin patch to treat peanut allergies or delivering a drug under the tongue.\n\nAimmune did not provide information on how much the drug would cost, but a recent analysis by ICER, a watchdog organization that focuses on drug pricing, concluded there was insufficient evidence that the drug was more beneficial than simply avoiding peanuts.\n\nRead More:\n\nNew peanut allergy drug could herald a \u2018sea change\u2019 in treating food allergies, but is not a cure\n\nThe Big Number \u2014 5.6 million youths deal with food allergies\n\nFDA approves first generic version of EpiPen", "description": "The treatment can desensitize people with allergies to small amounts of peanuts but carries the risk of side effects.
