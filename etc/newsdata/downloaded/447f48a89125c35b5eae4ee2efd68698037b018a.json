USA TODAY\n\nThe NFL is in the middle of a youth movement at its most important position: quarterback.\n\nThere are currently 16 starting quarterbacks in the league \u2014 half of the NFL \u2014 who are 26 years old or younger. If the Jacksonville Jaguars eventually appoint Gardner Minshew at the position over Nick Foles, that number goes up to 17. If Dwayne Haskins takes over for the Washington Redskins, it becomes 18, or what would be 56.3 percent of starters.\n\nPerhaps most interesting is that so many of these younger passers are enjoying early success. Of course they bring their own unique talent and perspective to the position, but they are also using elements from quarterbacks who came before them.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the crop of young star QBs and the skill sets they possess that resemble those of established veterans or previous greats.\n\nChiefs\u2019 Patrick Mahomes: Aaron Rodgers\n\nThis comparison works best for two reasons: How dangerous both players are once they leave the pocket, and the creative arm angles with which they throw.\n\nBut objectively speaking, Mahomes may be in his own category. He won the NFL MVP last season after just turning 23. While Rodgers has more experience and a proven track record, Mahomes is gifted with more arm strength, and he constantly churns out plays that defy the norms \u2014 throwing across his body, rifling passes on the run, whipping side-armed passes to avoid defenders. Perhaps the scariest thing for the rest of the NFL? The kid is still learning the position.\n\nPatrick Mahomes runs the ball during the fourth quarter against the Detroit Lions.

Jackson tied his teammate, Robert Griffin III, as the quickest quarterback in NFL history to rush for 1,000 yards, reaching the mark Sunday in 21 career games. But while Jackson resembles Vick in that capacity, he\u2019s already a much more polished and accurate passer. Jackson is connecting on 65.1 percent of his passes this season, while Vick\u2019s career rate is 56.2 percent. After a hot start this season, Jackson's production has cooled over the past four games, showing he needs to work more on protecting the football and his deep-ball accuracy. But Jackson is the fourth-youngest starting quarterback in the NFL, and he has only started 13 regular-season games.\n\nAt this point, Lamar is really a cheat code \ud83c\udfae\n\n\n\n(via @NFL) pic.twitter.com/tE7VLy0WYq \u2014 ESPN (@espn) September 22, 2019\n\nBrowns\u2019 Baker Mayfield: Brett Favre\n\nMayfield\u2019s ability to improvise and make a play when things breaks down are invaluable skills that have helped him shine early in his career. The flip side, however, is that this often leads to turnovers. Since Mayfield took over as Cleveland\u2019s starter Week 4 in 2018, no other quarterback has thrown more interceptions than his 25 in that span. That\u2019s why it\u2019s easy to see some of Favre in Mayfield\u2019s gun-slinging style. Favre, who played 20 seasons, has more interceptions (336) than any other player in NFL history.\n\nSo far this season, poor offensive line play has hurt Mayfield and pressed him into forced throws, which is certainly a reason for his touchdown-to-interception ratio of 5:11.\n\nTexans\u2019 Deshaun Watson: Andrew Luck\n\nWatson is a delight to watch and might be one of the smartest quarterbacks in the game (just listen to him dissect coverages in postgame news conferences.) That\u2019s why it\u2019s not surprising that Watson\u2019s game draws comparisons to Luck\u2019s \u2014 one of the smarter players during his tenure in the league. Though Luck was taller and stronger and more physical when he ran the ball, Watson is slightly more elusive in the open field. When it comes to passing, Luck may have had a more powerful arm, but both players are instinctive, can anticipate throws and are accurate. But where Luck tops Watson in arm strength, Watson gets the better of Luck in efficiency and protection of the football.\n\nDeshaun Watson surpassed 7,500 career passing yards in his 29th career game\n\n\n\nOnly @ProFootballHOF Kurt Warner reached that mark in fewer games (27)@deshaunwatson@HoustonTexans@kurt13warner \u2014 NFL Research (@NFLResearch) October 13, 2019\n\nDolphins\u2019 Josh Rosen: Eli Manning\n\nRosen\u2019s career stats should be considered with caution. He has been the victim of instability and is playing for his third offensive coordinator in fewer than two seasons. But this comparison makes sense because both are pure pocket passers whose strengths include sound footwork and mechanics. Manning is a polarizing player. But with his height, he effectively spread the ball around and stepped up in big moments. Manning\u2019s abilities have declined with age, but his effortless throwing motion and football awareness are traits seen in Rosen\u2019s repertoire.\n\nCardinals\u2019 Kyler Murray: Russell Wilson\n\nTheir respective heights are the easiest link to draw, but there\u2019s a lot more to it. Both have a baseball background, excellent speed and mobility, excel outside the pocket, and when they extend plays, their eyes stay downfield, looking for receivers breaking off of routes.\n\nGranted, the sample size at this point for Murray is minuscule \u2014 just sixgames \u2014 and it will be a long time before we know whether he can be a consistent playmaker. But his above-average accuracy and aggressive mentality put his ceiling at Wilson\u2019s level. While Murray is likely a step or two quicker than Wilson, it\u2019s the efficiency of Wilson\u2019s passing that Murray should aspire to.\n\nJets\u2019 Sam Darnold: Tony Romo\n\nMono knocked Darnold out of Weeks 2-5 this year, so he has only played in 15 games so far in his career. Initial impressions can be drawn to the former Cowboys QB who retired after the 2016 season. Romo was quite effective in his early years at using his athleticism to extend plays and scramble when needed. Darnold has showcased above-average mobility and has used his footwork to keep plays alive.\n\nBoth are incredibly cerebral, calm and can make all throws. Darnold\u2019s wind-up is elongated, so he could streamline his motion with some work. Also like Romo, he can be prone to stretches of carelessness with the ball.\n\nBills\u2019 Josh Allen: Steve McNair\n\nAllen, to be sure, isn\u2019t close to the level of passer that McNair was and needs to refine his footwork so he\u2019s not relying purely on his arm strength. He can also work on his efficiency with short-to-intermediate throws and needs to prioritize ball protection. But Allen\u2019s combination of size, speed, athleticism and arm strength could help him ascend to the type of game-changer that McNair once was.\n\nGiants\u2019 Daniel Jones: Andy Dalton\n\nOf all passers studied here, Jones is the hardest to compare because he has started just four games. And while there has been plenty to like \u2014 anticipation, accuracy, above-average mobility \u2014 it\u2019s still far too early to project his ceiling. Jones\u2019 footwork and throwing mechanics more closely mirror the prototypical standard, but Dalton\u2019s arm is likely a tick stronger. That\u2019s not a surprise, considering Jones was coached at Duke by David Cutcliffe, who has closely tutored the Mannings.\n\nJaguars\u2019 Gardner Minshew: Philip Rivers\n\nThe sample size is extraordinarily small, and there\u2019s still so much Minshew needs to hone before he can be considered a reliable quarterback, but in his five starts, he has shown flashes. Minshew has completed 63.9 percent of his passes while often cycling through his reads. That goes for both short and deep passes. He has been careful with the ball, with only two interceptions (against nine touchdowns) through his 194 attempts.\n\nGARDNER MINSHEW WHAT A PLAY \ud83d\ude24 pic.twitter.com/EmWMo5qcVI \u2014 The Checkdown (@thecheckdown) September 29, 2019\n\nPerhaps above all else, Minshew has showcased surprisingly good pocket presence. He has shown a decent grasp of the internal clock needed to know when to get rid of the ball. He has often extended plays by bouncing around just long enough to let them develop, and he has navigated tight spaces and managed opposing pass rushes well. It\u2019s hard not to watch Minshew and think instantly of Rivers.", "description": "The NFL is in the middle of a youth movement at quarterback.
