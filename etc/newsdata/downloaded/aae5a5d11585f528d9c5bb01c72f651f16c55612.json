Follow him on Twitter @SiWrites\n\nDesigners in Brooklyn have pumped holy water into Nike sneakers, called them \u2018Jesus Shoes\u2019, and, oh my God (sorry!), people are actually stumping up $3,000 for a pair.\n\nIf Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s allegorical tale the Emperor\u2019s New Clothes was real then you can guarantee these are the shoes the emperor would be proudly accessorising with his birthday suit.\n\nThe shoes contain blessed water from the River Jordan in the soles so you can walk on water like JC himself, they\u2019re made with \u201c100% frankincense wool,\u201d which apparently is a thing, (although I thought they\u2019d just redesigned a pair of Nike Air Max 97s) and there\u2019s a crucifix on the laces.\n\nAlso on rt.com Walk on water: $3K Nike \u2018Jesus Shoes\u2019 with holy water in soles sell out within minutes\n\nThey look a lot like a normal pair of sneakers, but they\u2019re not. They\u2019re actually normal sneakers which have been messed around with and then sold for a price that would have even the Catholic Church blushing with embarrassment.\n\nWhy in Jesus\u2019 name did the company MSCHF do this at all? They claim they were actually trolling what\u2019s called \u201ccollab culture\u201d and gave the example of a collaboration which saw Adidas making shoes with the name of an iced tea company on the side.\n\nSo, this is an attempt at satire, with Daniel Greenberg, the head of commerce at MSCHF, saying \u201cwe wanted to make a statement about how absurd collab culture has gotten.\u201d\n\nWhich is a noble aim, a valuable comment on modern society and capitalism, or at least it would be if they didn\u2019t then go and start selling them for $3,000 each! The only people being trolled here are the idiots buying them, and yes, they did sell out in minutes.\n\nThe stunt has ended up being a satire on fashion victims and the power of capitalism to find someone who will buy literally anything. It\u2019s not the first time a design company has managed to find a way to monetise irony, but at $3k, I\u2019m not sure where the irony is anymore. I suppose the irony is that an attempt at showing how collaboration culture has gone too far, has gone too far.\n\nAlso on rt.com The $438k old Nikes are holy relics of modern capitalism, like old saints\u2019 bones were to Christians\n\nGreenberg says MSCHF wondered what \u201cwould a collab with Jesus Christ look like?\u201d My answer to him would be, it would look like the last few thousand years of history, religions are the kings of the collaboration, and to be fair to him, the price tag is often much bigger.\n\nLike this story?
