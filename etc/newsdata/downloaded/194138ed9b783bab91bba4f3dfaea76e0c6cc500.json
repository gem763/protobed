He had just turned 18 when he entered university but made it through his first degree without any unusual financial difficulties. It was later, in his master\u2019s year, that his finances fell apart and contributed to a collapse in his mental health.\n\nMost students will not face the full trauma that Dan went through. Yet many will struggle with their finances, leading to considerable pressure and potentially affecting their studies.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nUniversities across the country are preparing for, or celebrating, Freshers\u2019 Week. It\u2019s an exciting, exhilarating event where new students are plunged into undergrad life. But amid all the advice about simple, cheap student recipes and which nights are cheapest to go out (Wednesdays), there\u2019s often scant focus on the financial risks and how to avoid them.\n\nA new study from the comparison site MoneySuperMarket shows that the percentage of students using payday loans while at university has risen by 136 per cent \u2013 from a tenth to more than a quarter in the last decade. Nearly a third of the 627 students questioned said they spent their maintenance loan by week five, and 36 per cent also relied on a credit card, compared to just a quarter 10 years ago\n\nIt\u2019s all too easy for students to fall into problem debt \u2013 the pressure to spend and the limited time to carry out paid work can make it hard to balance budgets. And many students have only just left home, a time of life where it\u2019s all too easy to make mistakes.\n\nBut financial mistakes can last a lot longer.\n\n\u201cThe loan I received was not nearly enough to provide for comfortable living and a bursary I received from the university was quickly plunged into living costs,\u201d says Dan. His circumstances worsened when he decided to move out of his shared accommodation.\n\n\u201cI was unable to find a replacement for my original room and was paying two rents, amounting to over \u00a31,000 a month. I was forced to find a full-time job to supplement my income, all while finishing a thesis.\u201d\n\nHis spending habits were also problematic. \u201cI had maxed out my student overdraft, a \u00a31,000 credit card, and had made an irresponsible purchase of a keyboard on two occasions, requiring me to sell them for a loss.\u201d\n\nDan is blunt about why he found himself in such difficulties. \u201cMy debt came from bad decisions. I spent money because I thought it would help me out of a difficult living arrangement or simply to improve my day-to-day lifestyle.\u201d\n\nHis mental health suffered and he says his life \u201ctumbled into one awful experience\u201d, culminating in a suicide attempt. After that, he knew he had to act if he was going to get better.\n\n\u201cI came back to my family home to recover,\u201d he says. \u201cI was able to obtain a resettlement loan from the bank to cover the full costs of my debts, paid back over seven years with low interest.\n\n\u201cFrankly, if I didn\u2019t have the bank offering me that option I\u2019d be in a much worse position. I couldn\u2019t have worked following the suicide attempt and I\u2019m still recovering two years later.\u201d\n\nUnderstandably, the many pressures he was under, including his financial problems, affected his studies. \u201cIt was the problem I\u2019d go back to when all others fell on top of me \u2013 as in \u2018Oh and I\u2019ve got my thesis to complete still.\u2019\n\n\u201cI passed but, had I focused more, I\u2019m sure I could have achieved a higher grade instead of the pass mark.\u201d\n\nWhile most students do not struggle to the same extent as Dan, it\u2019s undeniable that financial worries can have a huge impact on their studies and general wellbeing.\n\nVivi Friedgut, founder of Blackbullion, a learning platform that partners with universities to provide financial education to students, says undergraduates these days are being squeezed by far higher living costs.\n\n\u201cThey are bridging these financial gaps by working and many \u2013 21 per cent of 2,000 student respondents to 2018\u2019s Blackbullion survey \u2013 are relying on unsecured financial products like credit cards, and payday loans, to cover shortfall.\n\n\u201cUnmanageable debt is stressful \u2013 it impacts how students live and learn while creating a vicious mental health cycle.\n\n\u201cReducing this stress means minimising debt so be sure to maximise your incomings by making full use of scholarships and other funds while also minimising unnecessary outgoings like tech enabled transport, food deliveries and subscriptions.\u201d\n\nHer top advice for freshers is to look at their budget and plan it out before they begin their studies, allowing them greater control and oversight of their finances.\n\nDan\u2019s story highlights that the most important lesson for every student is not about budgeting or finding the most competitive financial products, although those are essential. The most important lesson is that no financial situation is so bad it can\u2019t be fixed.", "description": "\u201cIt was a devastating period for me.
