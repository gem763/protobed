The suit also took issue with Trump Organization licensing arrangements approved by foreign governments.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe new 2nd Circuit decision sharply rejected a ruling two months ago from another federal appeals court, the Richmond-based 4th Circuit, which tossed out a similar emoluments suit filed in Maryland.\n\nSecond Circuit Judge Pierre Leval said the 4th Circuit and his dissenting 2nd Circuit College Judge John Walker regarded the suits with too much skepticism because they appeared to be politically motivated.\n\n\u201cWhile it is certainly possible that these lawsuits are fueled in part by political motivations, we do not understand the significance of that fact,\u201d wrote Leval, joined by Judge Christopher Droney. \u201cWhile the existence of a political motivation for a lawsuit does not supply standing, nor does it defeat standing. \u2026 Whether a lawsuit has political motivations is irrelevant to these determinative issues.\u201d\n\nThe New York-based suit was filed by the liberal watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington on its own behalf, as well as on behalf of hotel and restaurant owners and workers who contended that they were suffering competitive harm from potential customers diverting their business to curry favor with Trump.\n\nThe judge who originally dismissed the CREW suit, George Daniels, said the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of harm were too speculative and remote to let the suit go forward.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

However, a request is pending for the full bench of the 4th Circuit to review that court\u2019s earlier decision. If the 4th Circuit ends up issuing a new decision allowing the Maryland-based case to continue, the Supreme Court may be less likely to jump into the fray.\n\nAnother suit filed by Democratic lawmakers in Washington was given the go-ahead by a district court judge in the capital and is currently on appeal to the D.C. Circuit.\n\nDespite the victory for Trump\u2019s critics Friday, the continued legal maneuvering leaves ample possibility that the wrangling over his alleged receipt of emoluments could continue well into next year, forestalling any intrusive examination of his business empire\u2019s foreign dealings until after the 2020 election.", "description": "The ruling resurrects the first lawsuit President Donald Trump faced over claims that his business dealings violated the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause.", "authors": ["Josh Gerstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/71/9a/ac46e31d41808c598717b1a254dc/19913-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
