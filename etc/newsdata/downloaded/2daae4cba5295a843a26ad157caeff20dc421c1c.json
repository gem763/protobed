We\u2019re building a beautiful wall, a big one that really works, that you can\u2019t get over, you can\u2019t get under.\u201d\n\nObviously, we aren\u2019t actually doing that, and lots of people made fun of Trump. So several hours later, Trump attempted an \u201cI meant to do that\u201d style move, tweeting: \u201c(Kiddingly) We\u2019re building a Wall in Colorado\u201d(then stated, \u201cwe\u2019re not building a Wall in Kansas but they get the benefit of the Wall we\u2019re building on the Border\u201d) refered to people in the very packed auditorium, from Colorado & Kansas, getting the benefit of the Border Wall!\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously, as he says in the tweet he was kiddingly. I mean, if you look at the tape it\u2019s clear he was doing a jokel,\u201d Colbert said before rolling a clip of Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cYeah. That\u2019s how you know he\u2019s kidding because he said it really works,\u201d Colbert continued. \u201cYou know the old joke: Two peanuts were walking down the street, and one was assaulted. Really. Brutally assaulted. He was almost a-murdered.\u201d\n\nColbert offered one final defense of Trump\u2019s comedy stylings. \u201cNow as a fellow comedian, I get what he\u2019s doing here. Before you tell a joke, it\u2019s important to kick it off with \u2018kiddingly.\u2019 If you don\u2019t believe me, just check out my prompter.\u201d\n\nYes, the teleprompter included \u201ckiddingly,\u201d and you can see for yourself in the clip below.\n\n\n\n\n\nTONIGHT: Trump tries his hand at comedy! #LSSC pic.twitter.com/dFo4ZSjvc4\n\n\u2014 The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) October 25, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nRead original story Stephen Colbert \u2018Kiddingly\u2019 Defends Trump\u2019s Claim That His Colorado Border Wall Error Was a Joke At TheWrap", "description": "On Thursday\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d Stephen Colbert took a moment to belatedly dunk on Donald Trump for claiming a border wall is being built in Colorado, and then trying to claim he meant it as a joke.On Wednesday, during a speech in Pennsylvania, Trump told a cheering crowd \u201cWe\u2019re building a wall in Colorado", "authors": ["Ross A.
