What that means is they have all the parts available for any repairs that might need to be done,\" Johri said.\n\nUTC reported quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $2.21 and beat analyst average estimate of $2.03. The company also raised its 2019 adjusted profit outlook to a range of $8.05 to $8.15 per share, up from prior forecast of between $7.90 and $8.05.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur, Bernard Orr)", "description": "Billions are at stake for aircraft suppliers of the MAX including UTC as Boeing works on fixes for the beleaguered plane, which will need the final nod from regulators to return to service.  \"From our perspective, we expect rates to be the same this year at 42 (737 MAX aircraft per month),\"", "authors": ["Ankit Ajmera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MU0O6XtArtj7pePhtfdzKg--~B/aD01MzM7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/60f0de237f230e1d867dd1d5efc19196", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
