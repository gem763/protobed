Japan's government and banks also play an important role in financing new coal plants elsewhere in Asia.\n\nNevertheless, Koizumi said he wanted Japan to do more on climate, invoking his country's role in forging the Kyoto Protocol, a climate treaty agreed in the Japanese city of Kyoto in 1997.\n\n\"We haven't taken the strong action and powerful leadership since then, but from now on, from today, we want to do more,\" Koizumi said, without giving details.\n\nKoizumi sparked controversy shortly after being appointed when he told his first news conference that he wants Japan to close down nuclear reactors to avoid a repeat of the Fukushima catastrophe in 2011. Isshu Sugawara, newly-appointed as trade minister, responded by saying it would be unrealistic to rid Japan of nuclear power.\n\nKoizumi reiterated his opposition to nuclear power on Sunday. \"I want to realise a society, a country, with no fear about the nuclear crisis,\" he said. \"But it isn't easy, it's a complicated issue. But I'll try my best to reduce the nuclear power in the future.\"\n\nReuters", "description": "Japan's new environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, pledged on Sunday to mobilise young people to push his coal-dependent country towards a low-carbon future by making the fight against climate change \"sexy\" and \"fun.\"", "authors": ["Matthew Green"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/22/19/Shinjiro-Koizumi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
