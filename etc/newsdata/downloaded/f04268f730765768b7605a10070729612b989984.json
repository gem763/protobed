He is likely acutely aware that the involvement of his followers could alienate many other potential protesters.\n\nThe demonstrators appear to have strong support among all sections of society, from working-class Shia slum districts in east Baghdad, to doctors and engineers sending supportive messages.\n\nThe streets are almost entirely empty, apart from the occasional bus, potentially used by the security forces.\n\nAnd the occasional bicyclist \u2013 one telling me that while vehicles and pedestrians had been banned, the authorities had said nothing about cycling.\n\nSo far the uprising has been confined to Shia parts of Baghdad, and Shia cities, but there is talk of a demonstration in the Sunni city of Mosul on Friday.\n\nFriday is likely to be a crucial moment for the protests, as it is the traditional day for demonstrations.\n\nSo far the government\u2019s over-reaction has succeeded in turning small-scale gatherings against the government into a mass movement, which it will find difficult to resist.\n\nThe motives for the government\u2019s hardline actions are mysterious, with speculation that the prime minister, Adil Abdul-Mahdi, is being advised by hawkish military officers, with no understanding of Iraqi politics.\n\nThe government has made few conciliatory statements, or concessions, and Iraqi journalists say that officials are failing to recall their calls.", "description": "Iraq is on the edge of a mass popular uprising which the government is seeking to stifle through a strictly imposed open-ended curfew and an enforced internet blackout.
