Only 4 percent of likely voters over 65 \u2014 those in the senator\u2019s age group \u2014 support him.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe poll and others like it show the stark contrast between Sanders and his main rivals for the Democratic nomination \u2014 former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenThe Hill's Campaign Report: North Carolina special election poses test for GOP ahead of 2020 Buttigieg's first TV ad: 'We need real solutions, not more polarization' Union leader: We back Bernie Sanders because he has 'petitioned for American workers' MORE and Sen.

While he won support from more than 70 percent of voters under 30 \u2014 even more than Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaFour states set to cancel 2020 GOP presidential primaries: report Bernie Sanders struggles to win over older voters Former 'Grey's Anatomy' star Isaiah Washington explains decision to support Trump after leaving Democratic Party MORE in 2008 \u2014 his opponent, Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonBernie Sanders struggles to win over older voters Texas Republicans sound alarm about rapidly evolving state Lewandowski predicts Trump will win by wider electoral margin in 2020 MORE, won the support of seniors by 70 percent.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the main reasons we lost,\u201d said one Sanders ally. \u201cWe have to do better this time around.\u201d\n\nA Sanders campaign aide says the campaign isn\u2019t putting much stock in the recent polls, mostly because they only look at Democratic voters and not the wide swath of other voters who support them.\n\nThe aide said they\u2019re running a 50-state strategy and leaving nothing on the table as far as specific groups of voters.\n\nIn recent months, Sanders has tried to target seniors specifically during visits to retirement communities, pushing his Medicare for All single-payer health care plan and his Social Security overhaul, which would raise taxes on people who make more than $250,000 in order to replenish the cash-strapped program.\n\nAllies like Cohen say they are also trying to push Sanders\u2019s policies on tuition-free college. While it is a proposal also aimed at young voters, they see it as also appealing to those young voters' grandparents.\n\n\u201cOn these issues and others, seniors are excited and supportive,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nSanders allies say they think they can ultimately win over Biden supporters. The Sanders campaign sees both their candidate and Biden appealing to working-class voters.\n\nHis supporters say it\u2019s likely Sanders and his surrogates will go after Biden directly, seeking to chip away at his electability argument and highlighting his ties to wealthy donors.\n\nSanders could have his chance to start peeling away some of Biden\u2019s support next week at the third Democratic debate in Houston. The two men will be standing alongside one another in that forum along with Warren for the first time.\n\nSunkara said if Biden\u2019s support crumbles, that will help Sanders.\n\n\u201cIf Biden does collapse, Sanders would be the main beneficiary,\u201d he said.", "description": "Sen.
