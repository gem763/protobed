Plans to Drop Presidential Primaries in 4 States to Impede Trump Challengers", "language": "en", "text": "The Trump campaign pointed out that in 1992, when President George Bush was seeking re-election, Republicans canceled primaries in eight states, and in 2004, when President George W. Bush was running again, they canceled 10.\n\nThe campaign also pointed out that in 1996, when President Bill Clinton was running for a second term, Democrats canceled primaries in eight states, and in 2012, when President Barack Obama was running, they canceled 10.\n\n\u201cWhether or not to hold a presidential primary is a decision made by our state executive committee every four years,\u201d said Drew McKissick, the chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party. \u201cThere is strong precedent on the part of both parties to not hold a primary when they control the White House.\u201d\n\nMr. Weld acknowledged the precedent but said the Trump campaign was taking it a step further.\n\n\u201cThis year, the Trump people tried to cancel the first-in-the-nation primary in New Hampshire,\u201d he said. \u201cThey did not succeed, but it shows you the lengths it will go to.\u201d\n\nBut with the potential for more Republicans to enter the race \u2014 Mark Sanford, former governor and congressman from South Carolina, has been toying with a run \u2014 political strategists said there was also a case for the White House to confront the challengers head-on.\n\n\u201cOur policy in the past has always been, you\u2019re an incumbent president, you have certain advantages and you\u2019ll probably be nominated again, but go out and win it,\u201d said Ed Rollins, the national campaign director for President Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1984 re-election effort.\n\nFor a year, Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers have made moves to block any challenger from gaining traction, saying that incumbents who have faced debilitating primaries have gone on to lose in the general election, as President Jimmy Carter did in 1980 after a strong challenge from Senator Edward M. Kennedy.", "description": "State Republican parties in Arizona, Kansas, Nevada and South Carolina intend to cancel their presidential primaries.
