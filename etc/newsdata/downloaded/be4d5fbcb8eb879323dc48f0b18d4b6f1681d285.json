He\u2019s made a similar move with the endings of each subsequent season, though with a somewhat different approach. For the past two years, The Good Place\u2019s big reset has happened before the very end. The humans returned to Earth toward the beginning of season two\u2019s finale; and Michael\u2019s Neighborhood experiment recommenced in last year\u2019s penultimate episode. In both cases, the finale\u2019s real climactic moment has been less about where our heroes have ended up, and more about the relationship between Eleanor Shellstrop and Chidi Anagonye.\n\nEleanor tracked Chidi down on Earth at the end of season two; and season three ended with him deciding to have his memory of their romance erased. Some Good Place fans \u2014 and more than a few TV critics \u2014 have been frustrated by how much the Eleanor-Chidi pairing has driven Schur\u2019s storytelling. This kind of \u201cWill they or won\u2019t they?\u201d sitcom plot can seem rather run-of-the-mill for a series otherwise grappling with grand philosophical issues.\n\nPersonally, though, I find the Eleanor and Chidi love story deeply moving, for two reasons. First off, The Good Place is in a lot of ways a show about making television: about collaboration, creative potential, and how human weaknesses demand compromise. Rooting the narrative in a Cheers-like on-again-off-again couple fits that motif. (Having Ted Danson hovering around in the background doesn\u2019t hurt.)\n\nSecond, \u201cEleanor and Chidi\u201d as a concept is about more than just two characters. It\u2019s about how feeling bonded to other people \u2014 and, in some ways, responsible for them \u2014 often makes us better humans, but can also push us to make rash, selfish decisions. As I see it, what\u2019s really at stake in The Good Place now, as season four premieres, isn\u2019t whether Eleanor can get a mind-wiped Chidi to fall in love with her again, but whether working toward that goal will help her achieve the larger purpose of proving humans can be decent, given the right circumstances.\n\nThere\u2019s still a lot of game left to play, but so far, our heroes\u2019 strategy isn\u2019t really working out \u2014 and Eleanor\u2019s feelings for Chidi are partly to blame. In the episode titled \u201cA Girl from Arizona (Part 1),\u201d the girl in question discovers that running an entire Neighborhood can be pretty tough \u2026 especially if you\u2019re a person who habitually cuts corners.\n\nTo be fair, Shawn and his Bad Place minions do keep throwing obstacles in Eleanor\u2019s way. This week\u2019s Good Place introduces the two remaining Neighborhood residents in Michael and Judge Gen\u2019s new experiment. First up: Linda, a frustratingly stoic Norwegian knitter, unimpressed by the Good Place\u2019s unlimited bounty. Eleanor tells Linda that if she wants, she can have Janet conjure up a baby elephant made of pure light that tells her the secrets of the universe (like \u201cShirley Temple killed JFK\u201d and \u201cStonehenge was a sex thing\u201d). But all Linda wants is a peppermint.\n\nEven more irritating is Brent, an aggressively un-PC \u201cmaterials\u201d salesman who died just as he was about to be #MeToo-ed by multiple women who, in Brent\u2019s eyes, \u201cneed to loosen up.\u201d Brent refers to Janet as a secretary, and when she corrects him, he rolls his eyes and complains, \u201cHere we go with all the terms we gotta learn, like \u2018vice-president in charge of helping,\u2019 or \u2018Captain Marvel.\u2019\u201d\n\nUnexpectedly, though, Eleanor\u2019s biggest problem turns out to be Simone. The neuroscientist is convinced she\u2019s in a coma, and that her subconscious is conjuring up this \u201cafterlife.\u201d When she\u2019s not trying to wake herself up by singing the Third Eye Blind song she heard every morning as a kid, Simone wears bizarre outfits and knocks over objects \u2014 and residents \u2014 determined to test the limits of her surroundings.\n\nThe obvious solution here \u2014 so obvious that even Jason thinks of it \u2014 is to introduce Simone to Chidi, a wise and calming influence who \u201clooks like one of those owls that graduated from college.\u201d But Eleanor hesitates, because she knows Chidi and Eleanor have proven chemistry, and she doesn\u2019t want this story to take that turn. She\u2019s already hurt enough when Chidi can\u2019t remember her name (a fact that makes Michael say, \u201cOof!\u201d and then try to correct it to, \u201cCool \u2026 f\u201d).\n\nMaking matters worse \u2014 and adding to the idea that emotional attachments can be bad \u2014 Jason and Derek keep failing to stay on-mission, because they\u2019re too busy fighting over Janet. Derek keeps popping up at public events (holding his usual cocktail, which is a martini glass filled with various garnishes), making Jason so mad that he finally pushes Mindy\u2019s plunger and resets him. \u201cI have been Dereked!\u201d his giant head announces on a screen over the Neighborhood. \u201cMurder has been me!\u201d\n\nEleanor\u2019s quick fix for all her mounting problems is to offload them onto Janet. But between keeping the Neighborhood running, her Derrick/Jason drama, Eleanor randomly asking for baby elephants made of pure light, and Brent wanting a BLT, Janet\u2019s starting to crack. The situation takes a turn for the worse when \u201cLinda\u201d turns out to be the demon Chris in a skin suit, sent by Shawn to drive everybody a little batty (until he flakes out and starts body-slamming folks).\n\nAn angry Judge Gen decrees that Linda/Chris be sent back to the Bad Place, and decides that Chidi will become the fourth subject in the experiment, alongside Simone, Brent, and the Tahani-torturing gossip columnist John. Shawn complains that because they already know Chidi\u2019s capable of improving, this is \u201clike studying for a test and then acing the test,\u201d which to him is \u201ccheating.\u201d\n\nBut one of the major recurring ideas in The Good Place is that every time these characters try to repeat something they got right once before, they somehow screw it up \u2014 either through impatience or due to a lack of understanding of what worked the first time. Not only is there no guarantee that Chidi will pass muster again, but it\u2019s highly likely that Eleanor\u2019s interventions will harm rather than help.\n\nThat\u2019s what \u201cEleanor and Chidi\u201d really does for this show, as a plot driver. Together, at times, these two have represented this elusive paradise that The Good Place keeps dangling: a place where people are kind to each other, enjoy each other, and accomplish great things side-by-side. But they also represent the all-too-human insecurities that keep heaven just out of reach.\n\nIn the Neighborhood\n\nNot a lot of Easter eggs or sight gags in the Neighborhood this week, but we do get a peek at a new restaurant: Lasagne Come Out Tomorrow.\n\nThe first question \u201cLinda\u201d asks about her afterlife of limitless options is, \u201cIs there a fitness center?\u201d That line\u2019s even better in retrospect, once we know it\u2019s actually spoken by Chris, the demon who always rips off his shirt to go to the gym.\n\nIn case you weren\u2019t aware, last week NBC teased this new season of The Good Place with the six-episode web series The Selection, which tells the story of how Shawn came up with his plan to sabotage the new Neighborhood experiment. The series isn\u2019t essential viewing, but it\u2019s short (about 15 minutes, total), and anyone who enjoys the sick humor of the show\u2019s Bad Place scenes will enjoy the part where the demons order lunch, and one of them says she\u2019s not hungry enough to eat a whole baby but might order a baby \u201cfor the table.\u201d\n\nNothing in The Selection, though, is as funny as in this week\u2019s episode when the demons sing the Bad Place anthem: the \u201c1-877-Kars-4-Kids\u201d jingle.", "description": "Turns out running an entire Neighborhood can be pretty tough\u2026 especially if you\u2019re a person who habitually cuts corners.
