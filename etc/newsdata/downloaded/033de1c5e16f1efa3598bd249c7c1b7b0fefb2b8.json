Visa requirements have also been simplified for China and India.\n\nREAD: SA scraps visas for new list of countries, including New Zealand and UAE\n\nThe announcement of the e-visa pilot starting in November was made on Monday to the Presidential Working Committee at the Job Summit by DHA Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi. The summit has prioritised growing tourism numbers as a way to boost the economy and create much-needed jobs in South Africa.\n\n\n\n\"In November, DHA will embark on a pilot scheme for the issuing of e-visas, which applicants will be able to access online, eliminating the need for applicants to visit South African missions abroad,\" says Motsoaledi.\n\n\n\nHe also reported that the DHA has lowered turnaround time for critical work skills visas, which are now issued within four weeks in 88,5% of applications. Business and general work visas are issued within eight weeks in 98% of applications.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Home Affairs is constantly reviewing its operations to ensure that we relax entry requirements without compromising our responsibility towards the safety and security of our citizens,\u201d adds Motsoaledi.\n\nALSO SEE: These are the cheapest months to fly to these visa-free islands from South Africa\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa has commended the DHA for improving service efficiency while on a walkabout at the department's Tshwane offices. He was shown how the e-visa system works, saying it places South Africa on par with other countries around the world.\n\nHe also cautioned the DHA to \"not be the home of corruption\" which will taint their efforts.\n\nIndustry reaction\n\nDavid Frost, CEO of the Southern Africa Tourism Services Association, see this the pilot as \"huge new\" for the industry, especially ahead of the busy December period.\n\n\u201cThis effectively removes a massive tourism obstacle. As an industry we need to eliminate as many barriers to inbound tourism as we can in order to grow tourism to South Africa.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too soon to tell how this has impacted tourism numbers since the new statistics have yet to be announced, but one only has to look at how tourism numbers decreased from New Zealand in 2017 when visas became mandatory for visitors to South Africa, to be able to ascertain the positive impact the reverse would have,\u201d added Frost.\n\n*Compiled by Gabi Zietsman", "description": "Home Affairs minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi also lauded the lowered turnaround time for work and business visas.", "authors": ["Minutes Ago"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6493/56d0b1702bbe4a5baf6603ff49607f31.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
