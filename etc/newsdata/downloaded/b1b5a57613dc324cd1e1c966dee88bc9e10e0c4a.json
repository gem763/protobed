(AP) - It\u2019s no surprise a matchup between winless teams was decided by a dropped pass.\n\nRunning back Kenyan Drake couldn\u2019t handle Ryan Fitzpatrick\u2019s quick throw in the flat on a 2-point conversion try with 6 seconds left Sunday, allowing the Washington Redskins to escape with their first victory of the year by beating the Miami Dolphins 17-16.\n\nDrake had four defenders between him and the end zone and probably wouldn\u2019t have scored even if he had secured the ball. But the drop put the brakes on a frantic comeback by the Dolphins, who trailed 17-3 when Fitzpatrick replaced Josh Rosen to start the fourth quarter.\n\nRedskins rookie Terry McLaurin caught two touchdown passes, and veteran Adrian Peterson more than doubled his season rushing total with 118 for Bill Callahan in his first game as interim coach.\n\n\u201cGames like this, two winless teams, everybody pulls out the stops,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cIt was wild all the way to the last minute.\u201d\n\nWashington (1-5) looked like a different team after firing coach Jay Gruden, although the caliber of the opposition had something to do with that. The Dolphins (0-5) remained winless under rookie coach Brian Flores but helped their chances of securing the No. 1 draft pick in April.\n\nWhen asked about the two-point conversion, Flores said he was going for the win.\n\n\u201cWe felt good about the play - something that we worked on all week,\u201d he said.\n\nDrake, however, said another running back practiced that play, and not him.\n\nFitzpatrick led two touchdown drives, including a climactic 75-yard march that began with 2:02 left. After he hit DeVante Parker for an 11-yard score to cut the deficit to one point, Flores decided to go for 2.\n\nDrake split wide left, went in motion and had traffic around him when the pass was thrown his way.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t going to walk in the end zone,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cHe was going to have to do something significant and special. We wanted to give him the chance to do that.\u201d\n\nDrake said, \u201cI have to hold my end of the bargain up. Everyone has their job to do. My job is to catch the ball and get in the end zone.\u201d\n\nREDSKINS OFFENSE\n\nAlthough Miami\u2019s defense mustered its best effort of the season, McLaurin slipped behind the secondary to catch scoring passes of 25 and 33 yards from Case Keenum, who returned after missing one game because of a foot injury.\n\nMcLaurin, a third-round draft pick who has been one of the Redskins\u2018 few bright spots this year, totaled four receptions for 100 yards.\n\nCallahan gave Peterson a significant workload as expected, and the four-time All-Pro running back carried 23 times to reach the 100-yard mark for the 56th time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about having opportunities and sticking to it,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cThere were a couple times they stuffed us, but we stuck to running the ball.\u201d\n\nPHOTO OP\n\nAfter making a diving interception, Redskins linebacker Shaun Dion Hamilton rose and trotted 35 yards to the end zone, waving for his teammates to join him. More than a dozen did to strike a pose for photographers.\n\nSPUTTERING DOLPHINS\n\nMiami\u2019s offense generated few cheers from the half-empty stadium until the end, and remained on pace for the lowest-scoring 16-game season in NFL history.\n\nThe Dolphins used six offensive linemen at times and converted two fourth downs, one with special teams trickery. They attempted an onside kick, which was foiled by a penalty.\n\nNothing could reverse their fortunes. Miami never led and has been ahead for only 3 minutes, 49 seconds this season.\n\nWashington intercepted Rosen twice and sacked him five times before Flores benched him.\n\n\u201cI was disappointed, but I understood the situation,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cIt was obviously a smart decision.\u201d\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nRedskins: RB Chris Thompson left the game in the third quarter with a foot injury. TE Jerome Cunningham departed in the fourth quarter with a knee injury.\n\nDolphins: CB Ken Webster limped off the field with a leg injury in the third quarter. DE Avery Moss left the game in the third quarter to be evaluated for a possible concussion, returned and suffered an ankle injury.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nREDSKINS: Callahan said Keenum will remain the starter when the Redskins play host to San Francisco on Oct. 20. Washington won the last time the teams met two years ago.\n\nDOLPHINS: Flores said Rosen will remain the starter when the Dolphins play Oct. 20 at Buffalo. The Dolphins lost their season finale there last year, and coach Adam Gase was then fired.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It's no surprise a matchup between winless teams was decided by a dropped pass.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steven Wine"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/redskins_dolphins_football_64806_c0-172-4136-2584_s1200x700.jpg?3fc892ce8ec4385ef76d2e430aada2f0483aa71f", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
