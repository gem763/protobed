Despite vague UK promises that such checks wouldn\u2019t have to be done at the border, as far as the EU is concerned this would breach the Good Friday Agreement \u2013 and commitments made by the British government to avoid a hard border.\n\nUK suggestions that checks could be carried out at \u201cdesignated locations\u201d sound an awful lot to EU officials like the creation of customs posts. The UK has not been able to produce an adequate explanation of how these things are different \u2013 though it\u2019s possible their legal text might address this.\n\nThe issue the EU has is that such locations could become a target for terrorists \u2013 as they were before when customs processing centres existed previously. There are also concerns that other EU countries could seek the kinds of exemptions given to Britain.\n\nThe operation of cross-border businesses and the \u201cAll-Ireland economy\u201d would also be undermined by the plans.\n\nThe second big cause of concern with the UK proposals in Brussels is the stipulation that the Northern Ireland assembly has to approve the system once every four years and be given a full veto. This was introduced by the UK government to placate the DUP \u2013 whose votes Boris Johnson thinks he needs to pass any deal he gets. The unionists are also a weather vane for many hardcore Brexiteer Tory MPs, who have in the past suggested they will follow the Northern Irish party\u2019s lead.\n\nBut in bending over backwards to appease the DUP, the UK has upset everyone else, including Brussels. One party would effectively be able to end the backstop: rendering it, in the words of EU officials passim, \u201cnot a backstop at all\u201d.\n\nAs a result of these two objections, the EU points out, the UK proposals don\u2019t prevent a hard border when they\u2019re in effect, and wouldn\u2019t even be able to consistently do that.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that those two objections are essentially the differences between the UK plan and the EU\u2019s original Northern Ireland only backstop, proposed to Theresa May during talks over a year ago. Ultimately, if there\u2019s a landing zone both can agree on, it will probably look quite a lot like that policy \u2013 but whether the UK could sell such a plan back at home before an election looks unlikely.", "description": "British Brexit negotiators presented a new legal text\u00a0to the EU in\u00a0Brussels\u00a0on Monday, with the aim of \u201cclarifying\u201d their proposals.\u00a0 A spate of ring-round diplomacy conducted Boris Johnson and his ministers over the last couple of days hasn\u2019t gone well: EU capitals are adamant they won\u2019t be convinced to back Johnson\u2019s plan for the Irish border.", "authors": ["Jon Stone"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/15/frost.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
