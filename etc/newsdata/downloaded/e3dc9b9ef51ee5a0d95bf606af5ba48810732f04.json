We have to take three points,\u201d said team director Oliver Bierhoff before Saturday\u2019s flight east.\n\nWingers Serge Gnabry and Marco Reus both scored twice in June\u2019s rout, but Bierhoff warned against complacency against bottom side Estonia, who have one point from six qualifiers.\n\n\u201cSuch games can sometimes be strange. The longer you give teams like that air to breathe, the worse it can get,\u201d warned Bierhoff.\n\nEstonia are 86 places below the Germans, according to FIFA rankings, and Bierhoff wants to see evidence of the gulf in class.\n\n\u201cWe should make it clear from the first second that there is only one result.\u201d\n\nHead coach Joachim Loew had 13 players either injured or ill for Wednesday\u2019s 2-2 friendly draw against Argentina in Dortmund, but the situation has eased.\n\nFirst-choice players Reus, who had a knee knock, plus midfielder Ilkay Gundogan and striker Timo Werner, who both had colds, are now available.\n\n\u201cWe want to and will win so that we won\u2019t have any problems in the qualification,\u201d added Bierhoff.\n\nThe Dutch must slip up at least once in their remaining qualifiers if Germany are to finish top of the group.\n\n\u201cThat is the problem,\u201d said Bierhoff, \u201cso it\u2019s important for us to win our next three games,\u201d he added with the top two teams going through.\n\nWins over Estonia, then Belarus in Moenchengladbach on November 16 and three days later against Northern Ireland in Frankfurt will see Germany qualify.\n\nGnabry, who is in great form after scoring four goals for Bayern Munich at Tottenham 10 days ago and also netted in the draw with Argentina, expects a tough time.\n\nThe 24-year-old has scored 10 goals in his first eleven internationals.\n\n\u201cWe must not underestimate them, especially when they have their fans behind them,\u201d said the former Arsenal winger.\n\n\u201cThey will play very defensively to make it as hard as possible for us.\u201d\n\nFreiburg centre-back Robin Koch, who made his debut on Wednesday as a late replacement, will keep his place as Hertha defender Niklas Stark was sent home after a deep cut to his leg in training.\n\nGermany captain Manuel Neuer will be back in goal after understudy Marc-Andre ter Stegen faced Argentina.", "description": "Berlin (AFP) \u2013 Germany have been told to rack up an emphatic win in Sunday\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier at minnows Estonia in the race for top spot", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/14ef64_germany-winger-serge-gnabry-scored-in-win-estonia-but-expects-tough-game-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
