The Bias Response Team, which consists of University administrators and law enforcement officers, has the authority to subject students to discipline and sanction. It encourages students to report any suspected instances of bias, advising them: \u201c[t]he most important indication of bias is your own feelings.\u201d According to the plaintiff, the Bias Response Team has responded to more than 150 alleged incidents of bias in the last year.\n\nAs a part of the settlement with Speech First, the University of Michigan agreed to shut down the \u201cBias Response Team.\u201d Speech First President Nicole Neily said that the settlement should encourage others to sue public universities that violate First Amendment rights.\n\n\u201cSpeech First is thrilled that the University of Michigan has finally agreed to respect the First Amendment rights of its students,\u201d Neily said. \u201cSpeech First\u2019s victory paves the way for college students who may have been too fearful or intimidated to express their opinions to finally embrace their free speech rights and engage in true academic discourse. While our battle is far from over, we are pleased that the administration will no longer maintain policies that have both the purpose and the effect of chilling student speech.\u201d\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.", "description": "In a blow to the leftist stranglehold on speech policies on American campuses, the University of Michigan announced this week that it will be shutting down its \"bias response team,\" which accepted complaints from students for minor speech offenses by their peers.", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/02/Demand-Democracy-free-speech-protest.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
