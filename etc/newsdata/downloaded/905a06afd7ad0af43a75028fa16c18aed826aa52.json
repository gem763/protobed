Gold for December delivery was up $8.30, or 0.67%, to $1,512.20 an ounce, after settling at $1,503.90 an ounce on Tuesday.\n\nOil futures traded higher Wednesday, holding onto the bulk of earlier gains on the back of optimism over U.S.-China trade negotiations, even though the U.S. government reported a fourth straight rise in crude supplies.West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery was up 48 79 cents to $53.10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n\nIn Asia overnight Wednesday, trade was mixed, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.8% to 25,682.81, the China CSI 300 rose 0.1% to reach 3,843.24, and Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.2%.
