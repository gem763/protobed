The enactment even included a drone, weapons, and body cameras. Adoring relatives can be seen in the audience filming.\n\nVideo footage of the event, which took place last year, was posted on The Daily Mail. It shows five kids dressed like terror group Palestinian Islamic Jihad carrying mock sniper rifles and semi-automatic weapons as they raid a building. Inside are two other kids, one in Israeli civilian clothing and the other dressed as an Israeli soldier. Both are shown being captured.\n\n\n\n\n\nPalestinian kindergarten students in Gaza dressed as terrorists--armed with sniper and assault weapons--breaching an Israeli home as part of a graduation ceremony. How can there be lasting peace when young kids are bred to glorify terrorism and hatred? https://t.co/aAisyqgzy6 \u2014 The Young Jewish (@noahaphilli) August 31, 2019\n\nThe video was posted to Facebook and uncovered by research organisation NGO Monitor, which passed the footage to Mail Online. The group also uncovered an image of a training guide the school uploaded to its Facebook page in the same year which shows the Save the Children and Swedish Government logo at the top. The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) website shows that the country was giving aid money to schools in the West Bank and Gaza that year as part of a programme running from 2017 until 2019. In total, the agency gave almost $20million to fund school projects, including $6.6million in the year the video was filmed. Among the aims of the project was to 'prevent and raise awareness at a societal and community level that all forms of violence are not to be tolerated and that the government is responsible for ensuring child rights and protection.' A Sida spokesman said: 'Swedish Development Cooperation does not support the promotion of violence or terrorism, neither in Palestine nor elsewhere. 'Furthermore, we have absolutely no indication that the activities that Save the Children carries out in Palestine with Sida support (approximately $2m over three years) promote violence or terrorism, and we are convinced that this is not the case. 'As far as we can judge the only connection between this video clip and Swedish support via Save the Children is the possibility that some teacher from this school may have participated in a workshop organized by Save the Children that promotes non-violent forms of discipline in schools.' (DailyMail)\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the school has carried out a similar graduation program for Kindergarteners that had them performing military exercises.\n\nThe Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center published video from that incident in March 2017.", "description": ".09/02/2019 20:52:44PM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/245/50760f7b-80fd-47b0-b3d7-ee19444cc4b9.png"}
