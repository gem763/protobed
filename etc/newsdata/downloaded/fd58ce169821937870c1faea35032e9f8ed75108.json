It includes personal body safety lessons to help students identify and report abuse.\n\nAnd the Restorative Justice Student Leadership Coalition is a team of students empowered to facilitate conflict resolution circles and self-care among their peers.\n\n\u201cStudent learning is our purpose, and we know that students perform better academically when they are healthy in body, mind and spirit,\u201d schools Superintendent Jack Smith said on the Be Well 365 website. \u201cThe two go hand in hand to produce young people who are successful in school and in life.\u201d\n\nThe school system also updated its gender identity student guideline so students feel supported in expressing their gender identity in school. It includes making sure that students are referred to with their chosen pronouns and name, and access to gendered spaces like bathrooms that align with their gender identity.\n\nMontgomery County Public Schools also made several updates with regard to school safety, officials said. All schools\u2019 emergency plans have been updated, and each school has a resource officer who has undergone mandatory training.\n\nAll visitors are screened, and all middle and high schools have video surveillance and soon the elementary schools will too.\n\nPrince George\u2019s County Public Schools will welcome more than 132,000 students on Tuesday with a new chief executive officer and 22 new principals.\n\nCounty Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks in June appointed Monica Goldson as full-time chief executive of the public schools system. She had served a year as interim CEO.\n\n\u201cI am excited about the possibilities this school year brings to improve our students\u2019 experience in every classroom and every school,\u201d Ms. Goldson said in a press release.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
