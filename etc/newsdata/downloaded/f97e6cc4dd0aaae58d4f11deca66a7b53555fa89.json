This year, they're trying to add top-notch communication.", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "ASHBURN \u2014 The talent up and down the Washington Redskins\u2019 defense had fans excited about last season. But as the year unfolded, with the team fighting to remain in the thick of the fight for a playoff berth, it was clear something was missing.\n\nThere were certainly standout games, but there was also Drew Brees and New Orleans torching the defense on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d; the 491 yards and 38 points allowed to Atlanta; a 90-yard Amari Cooper touchdown that let Dallas get away on Thanksgiving; and the forgettable blowout loss to the Giants in December where the Redskins fell behind 40-0 after three quarters.\n\nAt times when the defense showed out, coach Jay Gruden praised the unit\u2019s communication; when it failed to contain opposing offenses, players often said it was breakdowns in coverage or not knowing what other teammates were doing. There\u2019s little wonder why a major theme prevailed among Washington\u2019s defensive stars, returning and new, over the summer.\n\n\u201cCommunication is the biggest key within the defense,\u201d safety Landon Collins said last month. \u201cOn that part we just stay on the same page, making sure what we got to do, and how we got to play it.\u201d\n\nCollins, the Redskins\u2019 marquee signing in free agency, will be leaned upon to shore up the final layer of the defense that was often torched by receivers in 2018. The 2016 All-Pro has helped Montae Nicholson, Washington\u2019s other projected starter at safety, to pick up ways to disguise coverages.\n\nNicholson was happy with their progress after the Redskins\u2019 Week 2 preseason loss to the Bengals \u2014 during which the first-string defense tormented Andy Dalton into a pick-six and two three-and-outs.\n\n\u201cWe want to get better at (disguises and) communication across the board, from Landon and myself to our corners to our \u2018backers,\u201d Nicholson said. \u201cThere can always be something to improve, but I think for the first time we were gonna be out there all together, I think it was pretty good.\u201d\n\nCollins isn\u2019t the only new arrival expected to play a crucial role in the communication department.\n\nThe Redskins signed inside linebacker Jon Bostic after Reuben Foster tore his ACL at OTAs, and soon he earned the starting middle inside linebacker job, which includes calling the defense\u2019s plays. That duty suits a player like Bostic, who values knowledge and communication and is a self-described perfectionist.\n\n\u201cSometimes coach may say something to a guy and I\u2019ll be all in their conversation, like, \u2018What does that mean?\u2019 They\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just for the D-line.\u2019 No, I need to know that,\u201d Bostic said, \u201cbecause pretty soon I\u2019m gonna be giving the call instead of him giving the call, because it\u2019s how I\u2019m wired. It\u2019s how I was raised.\u201d\n\nLast winter, the Redskins reportedly had discussions with the likes of Todd Bowles and Gregg Williams to get \u201cdifferent perspectives\u201d on their defense, though some in the media said it looked more like informal interviews to replace defensive coordinator Greg Manusky.\n\nBut with Manusky still on board, Washington hired two position coaches who have coordinator experience \u2014 Ray Horton, coaching the secondary, and Rob Ryan, in charge of inside linebackers. So the desire for smooth and constant communication applies not only to players, but to this conglomerate of coaches as well.\n\n\u201cYou get insights from all three of those guys,\u201d cornerback Quinton Dunbar said during training camp. \u201cAnd like I said, between those three guys, there\u2019s no one better than the other. They\u2019re all willing to learn from each other to make our defense great.\u201d\n\nWhile that much has changed, the rest of the core has stayed the same. The No. 1 corner is still Josh Norman; coach Jay Gruden has high hopes he will play at the \u201csuperstar\u201d level that aligns with his reputation. The front seven is led by Ryan Kerrigan, who posted 13 sacks last year for the second straight season, and recent first-round picks Jonathan Allen and Daron Payne.\n\nBostic feels the front seven\u2019s biggest strength might be its versatility due to the starters\u2019 array of skills.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got speed inside, that\u2019s one thing. We can run,\u201d he said. \u201cReally you don\u2019t see that. Look at (Josh Harvey-Clemons), Harvey\u2019s a long linebacker. So we can do a lot of different things whether we\u2019re blitzing, whether we\u2019re coming off the edge.\u201d\n\nSo how good could this defense become? Norman believes it\u2019s already the best defense he\u2019s been a part of in Washington, adding, \u201cwe\u2019ll get to the point where it could be all-time\u201d great. But viewed another way, the Redskins finished 20th in the NFL in defensive DVOA just a year ago and only made a few personnel changes besides Collins and Bostic.\n\nIt could land somewhere in between all-time great and same-old, same-old. But after the defense\u2019s dominant performance against Cincinnati, Nicholson lauded the unit and was the latest to mention its strong communication.\n\n\u201cThis is a little test, just to show everybody that it is real,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re here, and we\u2019re here to cause problems.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
