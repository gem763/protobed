They were helping Giuliani in his effort to dig up information on a company tied to the Bidens in Ukraine.\n\nThe men are accused of funneling hundreds of thousands from a mystery Russian businessman into a pro-Trump super PAC in violation of U.S. campaign laws banning foreign donations and efforts to conceal campaign funds.\n\nThe same super PAC spent millions to boost former Texas Rep Pete Sessions, who wrote a letter calling for the firing of former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich, who Trump trashed on his infamous July call with the Ukrainian president and who House Democrats want to interview Friday as part of their impeachment probe.\n\nThe House Intelligence committee wants both men to testify about their work with Giuliani in Ukraine as part of its impeachment probe into Trump's interactions with Ukraine. Their lawyer has said they won't provide the information.\n\nThe men were arrested late Wednesday at Dulles airport in Virginia, according to press reports.\n\nThis Facebook screen shot provided by The Campaign Legal Center, shows from left, Donald Trump, Jr., Tommy Hicks, Jr., Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, posted on May 21, 2018\n\nU.S. President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has coffee with Ukrainian-American businessman Lev Parnas at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, U.S. September 20, 2019\n\nThe pair donated $325,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action, through an LLC, the Wall Street Journal reported, and they are expected to appear in court in Virginia Thursday.\n\nAlthough the indictment mentions only an alleged scheme to violate campaign finance laws, the two men are also connected to a the sprawling Ukraine matter that has President Trump now faces a ramped-up House Democratic impeachment effort.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that the two men sought to use their connections to Giuliani to get the Ukrainian state gas company, Naftogaz, to replace members of their board of directors.\n\nMike Pence, Igor fruman, Lev Parnas, President Trump, and Rudy Giuliani are pictured in an image captured by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project\n\nChief rabbi of Ukraine Moshe Reuven Azman with the Governor Mike Hackabee and 'American friends of Anatevka' Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were pictured in Jerusalem\n\nAn unidentified man, President Trump, and Igor Fruman on July 4, 2018\n\nThe two men dined with Donald Trump Jr. in May 2018, along with Tommy Hicks Jr., according to a Facebook post that captured the event. Hicks was leading the pro-Trump super PAC at the time and now has a position as co-chair of the Republican National Committee.\n\nThey also had dinner with President Trump, and images Parnas posted on Twitter in May thanks the president for an 'incredible dinner and even better conversation' at the White House.\n\nHe also wrote: '!!!! Making America Great!!!!!!!' and tagged '#TRUMP2020.'\n\nAn image posted by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project shows them pictured with Vice President Mike Pence, Trump, and Giuliani.\n\nThey also donated to Florida Sen. Rick Scott and hosted fundraisers for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis headlined by Donald Trump Jr., the Miami Herald reported.\n\nThe men are being represented John Dowd, who served as Donald Trump's lawyer during part of the Mueller probe.\n\nTheir company, Global Energy Producers LLC, has been accused of violating campaign finance laws for its six-figure donations to the super PAC.\n\nU.S. election law prohibits foreign nationals from making contributions to U.S. political campaigns, as well as efforts to shield the origins of campaign donations.\n\nThose laws are in part to protect U.S. elections from 'illegal foreign financial influence,' according to the indictment unsealed Thursday.\n\nThe men 'conspired to circumvent the federal laws against foreign influence by engaging in a scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and State office so that the defendants could buy potential influence with candidates, campaigns, and the candidates' governments,' according to the indictment.\n\nIt says they concealed the effort from the campaigns themselves, and laundered the contributions through LLCs and through the use of 'straw contributors.'\n\nParnas was borne in Ukraine and Fruman was born in Belarus. Both are former Soviet Republics.\n\nAlthough the indictment doesn't mention Trump or the pro-Trump super PAC, it says: 'Specifically, in or about May 2018, to obtain access to exclusive political events and gain influence with politicians, LEV PARNAS and IGOR FRUMAN, the defendants, made a $325,000 contribution. to an independent expenditure committee (Committee-1) and a $15,000 contribution to a second independent expenditure committee Despite the fact that the FEC forms for these contributions required PARNAS and FRUMAN to disclose the true donor of the funds, they falsely reported that the contributions came from GEP, a purported liquefied natural gas import export business that was incorporated by FRUMAN and PARNAS around the time the contributions were made.'\n\nBut in truth and fact, the funds came 'from a private lending transaction between FRUMAN and third parties, and never passed through a GEP account,' it says.\n\nAlso indicted are David Correia, who is described as a businessman born in the U.S., and Andrey Kukushkin, a businessman and U.S. citizen who was born in Ukraine.\n\nGiuliani said he couldn't comment at this point when contacted by a Buzzfeed reporter.\n\nParnas told BuzzFeed he met with President Trump 'many times.' He was working in 2018 to help introduce Giuliani to Ukrainians as he explored his unproven theory that Ukraine carried out election interference by pushing out information on now-jailed Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort. Among his efforts was putting together a Skype call between Giuliani and Viktor Shokin, the former Ukrainian prosecutor whose firing Vice President Joe Biden demanded in 2016, according to the publication.", "description": "A pair of Florida businessmen who worked with Donald Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani to promote politically charged investigations in Ukraine were arrested on federal campaign finance charges.", "authors": ["Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/14/19541786-0-image-a-7_1570715711871.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
