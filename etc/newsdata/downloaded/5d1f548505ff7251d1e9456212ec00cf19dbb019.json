But lawsuits like that are unlikely to succeed, legal analysts said, and the witnesses might view termination as a less significant consequence than those that can come from defying a subpoena: fines or jail time.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more risk to them by not testifying than by going ahead and testifying and incurring the wrath of the president,\u201d said Peter J. Kadzik, a former head of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legislative Affairs who is now in private practice at Venable.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive branch had long feuded with its legislative counterpart, with each side taking dramatic steps to pry loose information or keep it secret.\n\nAD\n\nThe administration, for example, blocked former White House counsel Donald McGahn from testifying about his tenure, despite a subpoena, and Congress responded with a federal lawsuit. Attorney General William P. Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross refused to turn over documents related to the administration\u2019s bid to get a citizenship question added to the 2020 Census, and Democratic lawmakers voted to hold them in contempt.\n\nAD\n\nThe administration has said publicly that it will not participate in the impeachment inquiry. In a fiery letter this week, White House counsel Pat Cipollone called the effort \u201cinvalid\u201d and executed \u201cin a manner that violates fundamental fairness and constitutionally mandated due process.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever before in our history has the House of Representatives \u2014 under the control of either political party \u2014 taken the American people down the dangerous path you seem determined to pursue,\u201d Cipollone wrote.\n\nAD\n\nEven before the letter, cracks had emerged in the administration\u2019s strategy of noncompliance.\n\nFormer special U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker resigned from his post before sitting for a 10-hour deposition with lawmakers last week \u2014 essentially taking off the table possible professional consequences for defying his superiors. He also turned over explosive text messages showing how State Department officials coordinated with President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer to leverage a potential meeting between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart for a promise that the Ukrainians would pursue an investigation that might benefit Trump\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nAD\n\nSondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, flew back to the United States this week for planned testimony. But in the early-morning hours on the day he was scheduled to appear, the State Department ordered him not to testify.\n\nAD\n\nRobert Luskin, his lawyer, said in a statement at the time that Sondland was \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d but was \u201cready to answer the Committee\u2019s questions fully and truthfully.\u201d Lawmakers soon issued a subpoena, and Sondland\u2019s lawyers said Friday he planned to testify next week \u2014 though he would not turn over documents that belong to the State Department.\n\nThe person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the politically charged and ongoing investigation, said Sondland felt that when his appearance was voluntary, he had to honor the State Department directive not to testify. But the subpoena, the person said, changed the legal calculus.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOnce he gets a subpoena, that\u2019s lawful legal process. He\u2019s required to appear,\u201d the person said, asserting that the decision was not the result of any strategizing with the White House.\n\nAD\n\nThe person said that Sondland would appear without a State Department lawyer \u2014 because lawmakers would not allow one to be present \u2014 and that he would detail conversations with Trump because the president had not proactively asserted executive privilege.\n\nThe person said Sondland believed his testimony would be \u201cgenerally helpful\u201d in that Sondland did not fully understand that an investigation Trump wanted Ukraine to conduct was into former vice president Joe Biden and his son, and thus would benefit Trump\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t understand this directly related to something personal, like dirt on the Bidens,\u201d the person said.\n\nAD\n\nThe person said Sondland would not turn over documents because he believed that might violate the Federal Records Act. Sondland, the person said, was trying to \u201csteer as straight a line as [he] can between competing demands.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSimilarly, the chairs of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees said in a statement that Yovanovitch had been told by the State Department not to appear for her voluntary interview Friday. The chairs said that direction ultimately came from the White House. They said the House Intelligence Committee then issued a subpoena, and Yovanovitch complied.\n\n\u201cThis duly authorized subpoena is mandatory, and the illegitimate order from the Trump Administration not to cooperate has no force,\u201d the chairs said in a statement. \u201cAny efforts by Trump Administration officials to prevent witness cooperation with the Committees will be deemed obstruction of a co-equal branch of government and an adverse inference may be drawn against the President on the underlying allegations of corruption and coverup.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGregory A. Brower, a former FBI assistant director for congressional affairs now in private practice at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, said that if the White House fired an employee for testifying, the employee might have some legal protection. Former employees, too, can essentially testify about whatever they want, as the White House has almost no way to punish them for it, he said.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say they go up and they talk about conversations with the president and perhaps other things the administration might argue are privileged. There\u2019s no remedy,\u201d Brower said. \u201cUnless we\u2019re talking about improper disclosure of classified info., there\u2019s no crime, there\u2019s no contract.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The White House has said it won\u2019t cooperate with lawmakers.
