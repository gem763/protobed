Here's What to Know About This Year's Best Deals\n\nYou might have been surrounded by pumpkin spice everything and graveyard lawn ornaments the last time you made a Target run. But in terms of finding the absolute best deals at Target, we\u2019ve already got our eyes on the prize: Black Friday.\n\nMaybe because it\u2019s our job, but we\u2019ve already been asking: What are the best Black Friday deals at Target this year? Just like you, we\u2019re still waiting to find out the specifics \u2014 but we can make some educated guesses based on all the Black Friday deals Target had last year.\n\nWe don\u2019t know yet exactly when the Target Black Friday 2019 ad will be released, but over the past couple of years we\u2019ve noticed that big-box stores like Walmart and Target are releasing their Black Friday ads when there\u2019s still leftover Halloween candy on store shelves. (By the way, we also have guides for the best Black Friday deals at Walmart and Amazon you\u2019ll want to check out.)\n\nIn 2018, Target publicized its Black Friday ad bright and early on November 1, when it also launched pre-Black Friday sales. Lots of people are already wondering, when does Black Friday start at Target? Well, if last year is any indication, the sales will start early. Target\u2019s Black Friday store hours kicked off at 5 p.m. (local time) on Thanksgiving. Stores closed from 1 a.m. Friday and reopened again at 7 a.m.\n\nWe\u2019re also still waiting to learn when Target Black Friday deals will be available online. Last year, deals were available starting Thanksgiving morning. And if you have a Target REDcard, Black Friday is likely to start even earlier. In 2018, REDcard holders could access some of the best Black Friday deals online starting at 3 a.m. Eastern Time the day before Thanksgiving.\n\nMost retailers today now offer the vast majority of their \u201cdoorbusters\u201d online, so we\u2019ll keep you posted about the Target doorbusters \u2014 both in-store and at Target.com \u2014 as soon as we hear about them.\n\nBased on what we observed during Black Friday 2018, here are our best guesses about what kinds of deals shoppers might be able to score here. As we learn more, we\u2019ll update this post (bookmark it so you can come back and check) with all sort of details on Target\u2019s best Black Friday deals.\n\nTarget Black Friday TV Deals\n\nTVs are obviously a huge category, and the Target\u2019s Black Friday TV deals last year were pretty impressive. We expect this year will be more of the same, with lots of deals on new models of smart TVs of all sizes. In 2018, shoppers could get a 65-inch Samsung curved smart TV for $899.99, or a 55-inch Samsung 4K smart TV for $399.99. Target also had an in-store deal on a 55-inch smart TV for just $199.99. In addition to TV deals, look out for discounts on soundbars, as well.\n\nCourtesy of Target More\n\nTarget Black Friday Electronics Deals\n\nThere were some great markdowns on tablets last year at Target. Black Friday iPad deals included $80 off all 6th generation iPads. There also was a Target Chromebook doorbuster on a 12-inch HP model for $119.99 \u2014 $80 off.\n\nCourtesy of Target | Apple iPad More", "description": "Deals on TVs, toys, home goods, and more.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uxEk4tpfg1PKtiWKLoVJJQ--~B/aD0zNzQ0O3c9NTYxNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/money_403/02b3896c0752b63b8ba67a742368cd4f", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
