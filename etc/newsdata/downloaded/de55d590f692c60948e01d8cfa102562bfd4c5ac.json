They were at an intensive two-month yoga course in Australia \u2013 Carmena was 28 and from New Zealand, and James, 45, was from the US \u2013 and she spotted him on the first day by the door of the yoga studio. \u201cHe was sitting down, he had this awesome chest, dreadlocks, and I saw immediately he had such a beautiful warmth to his eyes,\u201d she says. A psychic had told her that she would meet her husband before her 29th birthday. \u201cI saw him and I thought: \u2018That\u2019s the guy!\u2019 I was in total disbelief,\u201d she says. \u201cI was terrified, actually. I was like: \u2018What happens if he rejects me?\u2019\u201d She turns to him. \u201cAfter class, you came up to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you came up to me,\u201d says James. \u201cWe both have tattoos, so we started talking about them.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s routine was to rise at 2am to practise yoga until 8am, then have a nap, breakfast, \u201cthen do whatever you want,\u201d James recalls. After about two weeks, a few of them arranged to go out for dinner, but only James and Carmena turned up. Afterwards, they had a moonlit walk on the beach, then \u2013 rather less romantically \u2013 kissed for the first time by a \u201cgarishly lit\u201d service station before going their separate ways to their accommodation.\n\nDid James feel that same instant connection? \u201cA bit. Something happened the first time we were together. I felt that this was a very special person and this wasn\u2019t to be taken lightly, this moment.\u201d\n\nWhen James\u2019s visa ran out three months later and he returned to the US, they planned to continue the relationship long-distance but it was a wrench. \u201cIt\u2019s funny because I\u2019ve always been very detached around romantic feelings, but this was so all-encompassing,\u201d says Carmena. \u201cI cried for, like, six weeks, and we were calling each other every day.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Carmena and Jamie.

Carmena smiles. \u201cJames said: \u2018We could probably just get married.\u2019 I said: \u2018Oh yeah, cool.\u2019 We were very cool about it but then I hung up and I started going: \u2018Oh my God, he asked me to marry him.\u2019 I was running round the house, like: \u2018I can\u2019t believe it.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe flew to Los Angeles and, six months after they met, they got married at San Francisco city hall. \u201cWe kind of got married without really knowing each other,\u201d says Carmena. \u201cOver time we\u2019ve gotten to know each other pretty well.\u201d Their families also had to make some adjustments. \u201cIt caused a bit of a ruckus because my mother thought the [17-year] age difference was too great \u2013 she was thinking of Princess Di and Prince Charles and how their marriage was doomed because he was so much older,\u201d says Carmena. \u201cAnd James\u2019s family had a few reservations about it as well.\u201d James says: \u201cWe won both families over.\u201d They lived in Los Angeles for 12 years, then moved to Carmena\u2019s hometown in Marlborough in New Zealand.\n\nNeither had been looking for a partner when they met. \u201cIt was a total surprise,\u201d says Carmena. \u201cI had just come out of a really dysfunctional relationship, which reaffirmed all the reasons why I didn\u2019t want to be in a relationship. Even when I met the psychic, I was like: \u2018Oh yeah, right.\u2019 I totally brushed it off and I didn\u2019t even remember her words until I saw James.\u201d What did James think when she told him, shortly after their wedding, about the prediction? He laughs. \u201cI\u2019d been around a lot of yoga people, so I just kind of went with it.\u201d\n\nWant to share your story?
