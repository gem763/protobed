The coach is looking for his first win in his third try against Iowa State.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have this game be a relevant game,\u201d Rhule said. \u201cThe first year we weren\u2019t a very good team, and last year, we were kind of on the other side of a lot of the games, and now it\u2019s time to go out and see if we can play against a Top 25-caliber team in Iowa State.\u201d\n\nThe Cyclones (2-1) needed three overtimes to beat Northern Iowa in the opener, felt much better about themselves after a one-point loss to 14th-ranked Iowa and did what they were supposed to in a 72-20 rout of Louisiana-Monroe.\n\nFor all the progress Iowa State has made in three-plus seasons under Campbell, the Cyclones haven\u2019t won a Big 12 opener. In fact, the last time Iowa State started 1-0 in conference by beating a team other than league doormat Kansas was 2001. The opponent back then? Baylor.\n\nThe Cyclones beat the Jayhawks twice since, making them 2-15 in Big 12 openers going back to 2002. But this is a group with growing expectations, led by quarterback Brock Purdy on a team with a steadily improving conference record - including winning marks the past two seasons - since Campbell took over.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re trending a lot closer to where we want to be after last weekend,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cI think after our first two games, I really felt like we were close in a lot of areas, and I thought the ability to kind of put it all together last week allowed us to be a lot closer to where we want to be.\u201d\n\nIowa State will be trying to pull even with Baylor in the series in the 18th meeting.\n\nCHECKING THE EMOTIONS\n\nBoth coaches got questions this week about last year\u2019s 28-14 Iowa State victory, when Cyclones running back David Montgomery and Baylor defensive end Greg Roberts were ejected. Baylor quarterback Charlie Brewer was tossed later in the game for unsportsmanlike conduct. Montgomery and Roberts played their final seasons last year.\n\n\u201cAny time you get into that and we\u2019ve already played in one of those environments, in one of those games, it becomes your ability to kind of control your emotions and your ability to kind of play, play to play,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe did that at times in that football game even after things got crazy in that game.\u201d\n\nKLUNKER FOR BEARS\n\nBaylor finished a weak nonconference schedule with a less-than-inspiring 21-13 win at Rice a week after the Owls were blown out by No. 11 Texas. The Bears were shut out in the second half and had just 124 yards rushing after averaging 318 yards in victories over Stephen F. Austin (56-17) and UTSA (63-14).\n\n\u201cI did challenge the offensive line, I did not get what I wanted back,\u201d Rhule said. \u201cWe did not play well up front last week, and obviously going into this week that has to improve immediately.\u201d\n\nPURDY IMPRESSIVE\n\nIn the win over Louisiana-Monroe, the sophomore became the first player in Big 12 history with at least 400 yards passing to go with three passing touchdowns and three rushing scores in a game. Purdy set the school\u2019s total offense record at 510 yards, and Iowa State had a team-record 714 yards.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a true dual-threat quarterback, but the biggest thing for a young quarterback is his ability to drop back and throw on time, it\u2019s really impressive,\u201d Rhule said.\n\nSPREADING THE WEALTH\n\nBaylor has touchdowns from 13 different players, tied for the most nationally with Oregon and Maryland going into this week. Nine players have accounted for the 11 touchdowns rushing, with two apiece from Brewer and running back Trestan Ebner. The Bears have three rushers with at least 118 yards each. That includes backup quarterback Gerry Bohanon, who is second on the team with 177 yards because of extensive playing time in the blowout wins.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Iowa State coach Matt Campbell is measuring the progress of the Cyclones in terms of three weeks.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Schuyler Dixon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/correction_la_monroe_iowa_st_football_12416_c0-220-4574-2886_s1770x1032.jpg?decd31be9814ee52330630a5318f4f9834848c80", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
