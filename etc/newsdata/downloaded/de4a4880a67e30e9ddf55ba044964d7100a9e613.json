It's a streaming service featuring Apple-created TV shows and video content that will run on iPhones, iPads, and other Apple products. It will cost $4.99 a month, but will be free for one year with new Apple products.\n\nDisney's own streaming service, Disney+, will be released on Nov. 12 for $6.99 per month.\n\nCompetition in streaming is heating up. In addition to Disney and Apple, CNBC parent NBCUniversal plans to launch a service called Peacock in 2020, and AT&T's WarnerMedia is planning an additional service under the HBO brand name. Netflix is the current leader in the market with over 151 million paid subscribers.\n\nDisney and Apple have had a close corporate relationship before they started competing for TV shows and streaming subscribers. Iger had a close relationship with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, and Disney bought Jobs' other company, Pixar, in 2006. Iger said that before Jobs died in 2011, he asked Iger to take his seat on Apple's board. Iger even mused that if Jobs were still alive, the two companies might have merged.\n\nIger also noted that Apple continues distribute Disney content through iTunes as well as Disney apps, and praised Apple CEO Tim Cook.\n\n\"Tim has done a great job,\" Iger said. \"No matter what direction you look, I think you'd conclude that company is one of the great companies of the world.\"\n\nFollow @CNBCtech on Twitter for the latest tech industry news.", "description": "Iger says he left Apple because the companies are increasingly coming into conflict as Apple creates television shows and movies for its own streaming video service.", "authors": ["Kif Leswing"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106139293-1568921756313img_7107rr.jpg?v=1568921841", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
