(Solomon Photo and Video Production)\n\nPeople had been losing their minds for days over the Popeyes chicken sandwich when someone threw out a suggestion for locals in D.C.: \u201cPopeyes is cool and all,\u201d the woman tweeted. \u201cIf you live in the DMV area you should check out the Roaming Rooster.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a family business owned by an Ethiopian immigrant who \u201chas always been kind,\u201d tweeted the woman, whose account gives her name as \u201cLa Hara\u201d and says she is a musician.\n\nThe tweet flew across the Internet last Monday, inspiring similar tweets praising the restaurant\u2019s fried chicken. The following morning, there was a line out the door at the Roaming Rooster in Northeast Washington.\n\nIt was \u201cthe best thing that ever happened to us,\u201d said Michael Habtemariam, one of the owners. Habtemariam said he recognized the viral tweeter as a former customer but does not know her personally. (La Hara could not immediately be reached for comment.)\n\nNow, there\u2019s a demand for Roaming Rooster\u2019s fried chicken sandwiches unlike anything Habtemariam has ever seen.\n\n\u201cSince then, it\u2019s been so hectic, I mean right now, we have people lining up outside the door,\u201d Habtemariam said Sunday afternoon in a phone conversation as he snatched a brief break from taking orders. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting.\u201d\n\nWhile Popeyes is cool and all if you live in the DMV area you should check out Roaming Rooster in DC.

For every hour the Northeast Washington restaurant remains open \u2014 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday \u2014 there are at least 30 people standing in a line that stretches out the door, Habtemariam said.\n\nThe food trucks are seeing a similar rush. Habtemariam has had to call in family members to meet demand, growing the staff from its usual nine to roughly 14 people, and everyone is working between 15 and 16 hours a day, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so happy \u2014 we have no life, but we\u2019re so happy,\u201d he said.\n\n[This 13-year-old opened a bakery. For every cupcake he sells, he gives one to the homeless.]\n\nHabtemariam, 37, his brother Biniyam Habtemariam, 41, and his brother\u2019s wife, Hareg Mesfin, 40, are co-owners of Roaming Rooster. The brothers moved to the United States several years ago, opened a falafel food truck soon after and in early 2015 launched the first Roaming Rooster truck.\n\nThe Habtemariam brothers fell in love with cooking as children, Habtemariam said. Both were born in Ethiopia but immigrated to Canada with their father and three siblings in 1994 in search of \u201ca better life,\u201d according to Habtemariam.\n\nThe Habtemariams\u2019 father, a pilot in the Ethiopian air force, was a single parent who lost his left hand in an airplane crash. Although Habtemariam said his father was \u201cstill an excellent cook, even with one hand,\u201d that meant most of the cooking duties fell to the two boys.\n\nThe brothers became adept at making all kinds of food, Habtemariam said: \u201cEthiopian, Indian, vegetarian, American, everything.\u201d In their early teens, both boys honed their skills at restaurants: Biniyam worked at a Canadian restaurant called Mother Tucker\u2019s, while Michael took a shift at McDonald\u2019s to help pay the bills, Habtemariam said.\n\n\u201cWe really love cooking,\u201d Habtemariam said. \u201cIt\u2019s really fun \u2014 it\u2019s relaxing, we just have always enjoyed it.\u201d\n\nEventually, their passion for cooking led the brothers to open a sandwich shop in Canada, which they sold before coming to the United States. Biniyam Habtemariam moved to America in 2009 to marry Mesfin; Michael Habtemariam joined his brother in 2012. Once both were settled in the United States, there was only one career the brothers wanted to pursue.\n\nThe Habtemariam siblings and Mesfin spent about a year and a half coming up with their recipe for fried chicken, Habtemariam said, although Biniyam was the mastermind. All three wanted something free-range and antibiotic-free \u2014 and it had to be delicious.\n\n[A boy held his crying classmate\u2019s hand on the first day of school. A photo of the moment has gone viral.]\n\n\u201cWe were just at home, trying it, sampling it again and again,\u201d Habtemariam said. \u201cIt has basic breading, it\u2019s not very secret ingredients \u2014 but the way we measure it, the way we put the spicy ingredients together, that\u2019s the secret.\u201d\n\nThat kind of dedication and care led Roaming Rooster to success well before the Popeyes chicken sandwich blew up in recent weeks. The first food truck proved popular, Habtemariam said, soon allowing the family to expand to three more trucks \u2014 and, last year, to open their first bricks-and-mortar restaurant.\n\nRoaming Rooster saw a steady stream of customers, Habtemariam said. Earlier this year, the eatery won \u201cBest Fried Chicken\u201d from Washington City Paper\u2019s \u201cBest of D.C.: Food & Drink Readers\u2019 Picks\u201d for 2019.\n\nBut it was last week\u2019s tweet that drove demand through the roof.\n\nHabtemariam said he first saw the tweet around 9 p.m. the day it was posted. At the time, he was inside the Roaming Rooster restaurant preparing for the next day of service.\n\nWhen he looked again five minutes later, the post already had 2,000 retweets.\n\n[A parking garage had 6 suicides in 4 years. Signs on the walls are trying to prevent more.]\n\n\u201cRight after that tweet, we got flooded, slammed,\u201d Habtemariam said. \u201cThe first day was probably at least double of what we usually make\u201d \u2014 and customers\u2019 appetite has kept at similar levels ever since.\n\nRoaming Rooster sells five kinds of fried chicken sandwiches. The two sandwiches pictured in the tweet \u2014 alongside a grinning Michael Habtemariam \u2014 are the Honey Butter Fried Chicken Sandwich and the Nashville Hot Chicken.\n\nUnlike Popeyes, Roaming Rooster is unlikely to run out of sandwiches any time soon, Habtemariam said. He has been on the phone with his suppliers at least once a day for the past week requesting more shipments.\n\nIt all feels surreal, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are just a small local company. We can\u2019t compare with Popeyes, but we really enjoy the love and support of the community,\u201d Habtemariam said. \u201cSeeing all this \u2014 it makes me feel like I did something right, that people are enjoying my product.\u201d\n\nJust then, someone yelled from inside the restaurant. Habtemariam apologized and said he had to go: Customers were waiting.\n\nRead more:\n\nUsing symbols, she calmed a nonverbal autistic boy on a plane.
