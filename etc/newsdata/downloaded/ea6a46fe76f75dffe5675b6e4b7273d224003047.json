Medical costs are spiraling out of control but supposedly this is not inflation. The average total cost of employer-provided health coverage passed $20,000 for a family plan this year, according to a new survey, a landmark that will likely resonate politically as health care has become an early focus of the presidential campaign. Annual premiums rose 5% to hit $20,576 for an employer-provided family plan in 2019, according to the yearly poll of employers by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. On average, employers bore 71% of that cost, while employees paid the rest. \u201cIt\u2019s a milestone,\u201d said Drew Altman, chief executive of the foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s the cost of buying an economy car, just buying it every year.\u201d At Elkay Manufacturing Co., a closely held company in Oak Brook, Ill., with around 1,500 U.S. employees, the cost of coverage has been going up around 5% to 6% a year, said Carol Partington, senior manager of total benefits. For 2019, the company introduced its first high-deductible plan, and put in place a new $250 penalty for employees who get imaging scans without checking prices through a price-transparency program.\n\nMedical Care Services vs CPI\n\nMedical Care Services vs CPI Percent Change From Year Ago\n\nInflation Understated\n\nThose charts look ominous and they are. But they dramatically understate the problem.\n\nThe reason is in plain sight. The BLS measures the CPI, the Consumer Price Inflation.\n\nEmployer costs are not included, anywhere.\n\nThe Fed's favorite measure of inflation, PCE, Personal Consumption Expenditures, does not look at employer costs either.\n\nSelf-Insured\n\nThe BLS reports a 4.3% year-over-year rise in medical care costs. It arrives at that figure by excluding all employer increases, then it averages prices paid by the self-insured with those on Medicare.\n\nThose buying their own insurance will tell you costs are up as much as 100%, not 4%.\n\nPercentage of Healthcare Uninsured Jumps From 8.0% in 2017 to 9.1% in 2019\n\nOn September 16, I reported the Percentage of Healthcare Uninsured Jumps From 8.0% in 2017 to 9.1% in 2019.\n\nHere is one of many charts.\n\nThe young and healthy are opting out. And why shouldn't they?The Obamacare design forces them to overpay.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just too expensive,\u201d said Grace-Marie Turner, president of the Galen Institute, a public-policy free-market research organization. People are siphoning themselves off.\u201d\n\nThose over 65 are the most likely to have insurance. Their costs artificially lower reported inflation for every group but themselves.\n\nWage Growth for Men About 1/4% Per Year Since 2000, Women About 1/2% Per Year\n\nDespite soaring medical care costs, please note that Wage Growth for Men About 1/4% Per Year Since 2000, Women About 1/2% Per Year.\n\nBear in mind, that chart of real (inflation-adjusted) wages assumes you believe the CPI.\n\nSome readers challenge the chart based on advancement. It's a false challenge. Those are \"median\" wages. By definition, 50% make more and 50% less no matter what the starting point.\n\nDon't confuse nominal wages with real wages. The median nominal wage was $568 in 2000. It is now $911. That's a 60% wage hike in nominal terms. Inflation took most of it.\n\nHome Prices Another Measure of Inflation Under-Reporting\n\nLast Chance for a Good Price\n\nThe Last Chance for a Good Price Was 7 Years Ago.\n\nHome prices are not in the CPI. Only rent is.\n\nThose who want to buy a home quickly discover wage growth has not kept up with home price growth.\n\nAmerican Dream\n\nIn case you missed it, 68% of Millennial Homeowners Regret Buying a Home\n\nThe top regret \"too costly to maintain\".\n\nMeanwhile, the Fed is concerned about the lack of inflation.\n\nWhat a sorry joke.", "description": "A poll of employers by Kaiser Family Foundation found premiums .09/26/2019 12:43:47PM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Shedlock", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/136/b5b443b1-c07e-4127-a195-d7262a023cc1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
