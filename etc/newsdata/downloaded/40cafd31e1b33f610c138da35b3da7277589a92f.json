It\u2019s not been a vintage year'\n\nBorn in Salford, Eccleston, 55, trained at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in London. He starred in the 1996 television series Our Friends In The North and was nominated for a Bafta. In 2005, he was cast in Doctor Who as the ninth Time Lord. He has just published a memoir about his father called I Love The Bones Of You. Divorced, he has two children and lives in London.\n\nWhen were you happiest?\n\nNow. I am father to Albert, seven, and Esme, six. I\u2019ve never experienced happiness as complete as caring for them.\n\nWhich living person do you most admire, and why?\n\nElsie Eccleston, my mother, for her emotional intelligence, kindness, intense curiosity, and chicken and leek pies.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in yourself?\n\nNot listening and insisting on being heard.\n\nWhat was your most embarrassing moment?\n\nTrapping my foreskin in the zip of my corduroy jeans when I was 14 and having my brother Keith release it; it took two hours. I was in an agony of existential embarrassment because, shortly before my brother came in, I\u2019d been doing what teenage boys do and was surprised, pulled the zip up and nearly circumcised myself. I bear the scar to this day.\n\nWhat makes you unhappy?\n\nGreed, hypocrisy and lies.\n\nWhat is your most unappealing habit?\n\nGreed, hypocrisy and lying. Also, speed-eating leading to flatulence.\n\nWhat is the worst thing anyone\u2019s said to you?\n\nThe mother of my children once said that I dance like I\u2019m straight out of the box and recently assembled.\n\nWhat single thing would improve the quality of your life?\n\nA little more spiritual enlightenment.\n\nWhat do you most dislike about your appearance?\n\nHow long have you got? I am not anorexic now \u2013 but I would say dysmorphia is still very present.\n\nTo whom would you most like to say sorry, and why?\n\nTo my children, because their mum and dad\u2019s relationship failed, and I know that has caused them great sadness.\n\nWhat does love feel like?\n\nI think I\u2019ve only really experienced it on a parental level, and it feels like the rhythm of nature.\n\nHave you ever said \u2018I love you\u2019 and not meant it?\n\nNo.\n\nSara Cox: \u2018My guiltiest pleasure? Cockles in vinegar\u2019 Read more\n\nWhat has been your biggest disappointment?\n\nFalling off the stage in the third preview of Macbeth at the RSC.\n\nHow often do you have sex?\n\nIt\u2019s not been a vintage year.\n\nWhat is the closest you\u2019ve come to death?\n\nDuring my severe clinical depression in 2016. I was at Piccadilly station in Manchester and a train was coming.\n\nWhat has been your closest brush with the law?\n\nIn about 1986, I spent the night in the cells for being drunk and disorderly.\n\nWhat song would you like played at your funeral?\n\nHot Legs by Rod Stewart: I\u2019m going to be cremated.\n\nHow would you like to be remembered?\n\nAs a loving father.\n\n\u2022 For help and advice on eating disorders in the UK, contact Beat on 0808 801 0677; in the US, contact the NEDA on (800) 931-2237; and in Australia, contact the Butterfly Foundation on 1800 33 4673.
