That case is still being considered by a judge. But in the course of the trial some eye-popping numbers came to light. Between 2010 and 2015, the admission rate for legacy applicants at Harvard was higher than 33 percent. It was 6 percent for non-legacies . More than 20 percent of the white applicants admitted to the school during that period were legacy students.\n\nBackers of legacy preference point out that at Harvard and other schools across the country, the student body \u2014 and with it the pool of alumni \u2014 has gotten more diverse over time. That means that the composition of the legacy population is also diversifying. At Harvard, evidence from the trial showed, some 80 percent of legacy admissions for the class of 2014 were white, while only 60 percent of legacies in the class of 2019 were white. Would ending legacy preference equate to pulling up the ladder ahead of a more diverse group of students who could leverage their legacy status?\n\nNot in the least. Consideration of race in admissions can be defended not only as a remedy for past injustices but also as an imperative for schools seeking to represent the population at large. But continuing to give applicants an advantage simply because of where their parents went to school is, as one critic called it, \u201ca form of property transfer from one generation to another.\u201d\n\nColleges counter that the children of alumni \u2014 partly by virtue of the education their parents received \u2014 are well qualified for admission into their schools. That raises the question: If the value of a degree is indeed generational (research shows that it very likely is), why do the progeny and grandprogeny of graduates deserve yet another thumb on the scale?\n\nLike many policies of past eras, legacy admissions get uglier the closer you look at them. A few decades ago, the percentage of legacy students at top schools was sometimes higher than it is today. But admission rates at those institutions have fallen much faster than the percentage of legacy students. \u201cIf you take a typical Ivy League school, maybe 20 or 30 years ago, they might admit two-thirds of legacy applicants. Now they might admit one-third of legacy applicants. But, at the same time, their overall acceptance rate has probably gone down from between 20 and 25 percent to between 5 and 10 percent. So, proportionally, being a legacy is even more of an advantage,\u201d Dan Golden, an investigative journalist, told The New Yorker.", "description": "A country struggling with deeply rooted inequality need not continue an affirmative action program for successful families.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/opinion/07admissions/07admissions-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
