Even when the sun is down \u2013 for a couple of hours after midnight \u2013 the sky is white.\n\nToward the end of June, the city has the Scarlet Sails festival to commemorate the end of the school year and the longest night of the year.\n\nWhile in Russia for the World Cup in 2018, I experienced the White Nights and decided to take a photo at every hour to document the unbelievably beautiful light in the city.\n\nVisit BusinessInsider.com for more stories.\n\nI was very excited to visit Russia for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but my favorite part of the trip ended up being something I didn\u2019t plan on.\n\nWhen I arrived in St. Petersburg, I found that the city was experiencing the so-called White Nights phenomenon. Located on the Bay of Finland, St. Petersburg is so far north that it has sunlight nearly 24 hours a day from mid-May to mid-July.\n\nToward the end of June, when the days are the longest, the sun sets after midnight and rises at about 2 a.m. But even then, the sky is never really dark.\n\nIt\u2019s an unusual feeling to see the sun setting so late and rising so early. It throws your biological clock out of whack, tricking your body into thinking it needs less sleep. Not a bad problem to have when you have a lot of activities planned for each day.\n\nLocal residents take full advantage of the long nights, sitting out in caf\u00e9s and restaurants until late. Many restaurants and bars stay open 24 hours. Many of the tourist attractions stay open late as well.\n\nThere are downsides to the surplus of sunlight. Teams in town for the World Cup worried their players may have trouble getting enough rest because of the sunlight.\n\nWhile I can barely pass a soccer ball, I was thrown off-kilter by the White Nights, often tossing and turning until 4 a.m. and sleeping through the middle of the day.\n\nBut being awake at odd hours provided a lot of time to see the city. I decided to take a photo at every hour to document the beautiful light \u2013 and the views, as you\u2019ll see here, were stunning.\n\nI was excited on my first day in St. Petersburg to see the famous \u201cWhite Nights.\u201d Unfortunately, the persistent sunlight from the night before screwed up my sleeping schedule. By the time I got out of the apartment, it was 3 p.m.\n\nThe character of the light around 4 p.m. was very similar to midday in most other places.\n\nAbout 5 p.m. the light started to change. The sky was clear and the sun bright and hot overhead, but the buildings began to cast deep shadows.\n\nThe hours between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. were very similar, with slight changes in the angle of the sun. It was as if the sun had nowhere to disappear to. This is about 6 p.m.\n\nIt was 7 p.m. and people were still lounging in the park as though it were high noon. At least the city never gets too hot because of how far north it is. It felt like a warm autumn day.\n\nAbout 8 p.m., the sun began to cast its first hints of \u201cgolden hour,\u201d the time before sunset when everything is blanketed in a golden glow.\n\nGolden hour during White Nights should probably be called golden hours. It lasts a long time. This is what it looked like a bit after 9 p.m.\n\nThe drawn-out sunset produces spectacular colors in the sky on a clear day, as well as regal shadows upon the city\u2019s buildings. This was about half past 10 p.m.\n\nBy 11:30 p.m., the sun was disappearing behind the horizon with a few last gasps of light. Petersburgians take advantage of the long nights. At least a dozen fishermen were casting their lines into the Neva River as the sun set.\n\nThings were much different a few nights earlier, on the night of Scarlet Sails \u2014 the city\u2019s summer festival marking the end of the school year and the longest day of the year. The sun hadn\u2019t even set at a quarter past midnight.\n\nScarlet Sails is the biggest night of the year in St. Petersburg. Everyone comes out to the banks of the Neva River to watch a grand display of fireworks, a water show, music, and the sailing of a replica 1700s-era boat with red sails. Just after 1 a.m., it became clear why it is called White Nights.\n\nA couple of days later, when I was outside a bar deeper into the city about 2 a.m., I snapped this shot. While the sun isn\u2019t directly visible, you can see light reflecting off the building. It never gets fully dark.\n\nAbout 45 minutes later, just before 3 a.m., the sun was rising over the horizon. You know that feeling where you start to see the sunrise and realize you\u2019re going to get a bad night of sleep? I had that all week.\n\nBy 4 a.m., it\u2019s light out. The sun is blocked here by the buildings outside the apartment I was staying in, just off the banks of the river.\n\nI have to confess I never saw 5 a.m. Well, except when a gash of sunlight sneaked past the bedroom curtain, reflected off a nearby mirror, and temporarily blinded me.\n\nWhen I walked outside a bit after 6 a.m., it looked as if it was nearly noon. It\u2019s a disorienting feeling. I was awake for the hours between 6 a.m. and 11 a.m. only once. It\u2019s like having jet lag that won\u2019t go away.\n\nThis photo was taken about 7: 30 a.m. The light is so vexing for the human body that the soccer teams that had to train near St. Petersburg for the World Cup had special curtains installed in their hotels and were required to close them a few hours before bed. If you don\u2019t shut out the light, you won\u2019t feel tired.\n\nSource: The New York Times\n\nI took this photo on my last day in the city. It was a little over a week after the longest day of the year, but the sun was still high in the sky after 8 a.m.\n\nOver the weekend, I left St. Petersburg to drive north to the neighboring Republic of Karelia, a northern region of Russia. The White Nights are much the same there. This is what it looked like about 9 a.m., two hours north of St. Petersburg \u2026\n\n\u2026 and 10 a.m. \u2026\n\n\u2026 I finally saw 11 a.m. in St. Petersburg on my last day in Russia. Strange, I know.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to describe, but the character of the light isn\u2019t unique only at night, but during midday as well. Everything looks like an oversaturated photograph. This is noon \u2026\n\n\u2026 and this is 1 p.m.\n\nThe White Nights are undoubtedly the best time to visit northern Russia. During the winter, the hours are flipped, with darkness for most of the day. This was 2 p.m. in Karelia.\n\nThis story was originally published in July 2018.", "description": "Business Insider - Every June, St. Petersburg, Russia, is so far north that it experiences near 24-hour sunlight from mid-May to mid-July during the \"White Nights.\".
