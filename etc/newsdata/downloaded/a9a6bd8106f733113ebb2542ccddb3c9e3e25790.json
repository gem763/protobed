At the same time, this has improved the incumbent telco's underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA), with the figure adjusted upwards by AU$100 million to a range of AU$7.4 billion to AU$7.9 billion.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nTelstra sees profit plunge 40% for full year\n\nRevenue was down 3.6%, while profit has slid by AU$1.4 billion for the year to June 30.\n\nTelstra questions whether metadata restrictions are working as intended\n\nFreeloading agencies skirting Australia's metadata restrictions often do not understand, or adequately protect requested metadata, the telco says.\n\nTelstra announces AU$400m revenue downgrade in wake of NBN corporate plan\n\nWith NBN connecting less people next year, Telstra will get AU$300 million less in payments.\n\nNBN reports positive full year EBITDA once Telstra payments excluded\n\nAdjusted EBITDA of AU$608 million wiped out by AU$2 billion in payments to Telstra and Optus.\n\nPenn maintains InfraCo allows Telstra to be part of NBN privatisation\n\nTelstra seemingly at odds with Communications Minister, even though Penn says they are \"very aligned\".\n\n5G mobile networks: A cheat sheet (TechRepublic)\n\nAs LTE networks become increasingly saturated, mobile network operators are planning for the 5G future.
