A companion ticket at most theatres, cinemas and concert venues. A bus pass, slightly cheaper rail travel. But \u2018Why?\u2019 I hear you ask. Well, there\u2019s a few reasons...\n\nI get companion tickets because I need assistance going to venues to stay safe. And when you\u2018re blind, you actually end up spending a lot of money on other things. More taxis than the average person, a lot of specialist equipment. So it is a relief to know you do get your travel a bit cheaper! So it\u2019s a perk, but a justified perk if you ask me!\n\n\u2018Looking\u2019 the other way!\n\n\u201cIf I want to ignore someone on the street I have a pretty good excuse! I don\u2019t actually do this, but I could!\n\nSuper skills\n\nMy personal favourite is being able to touch type. I\u2019ve been able to type on a computer at speed, without looking, since I was eight! Some more skills include being able to read braille, using voice over software at amazing speeds, and many more!\n\nSaintly virtues\n\nGod, I\u2019m patient! I\u2019ve been vision impared all my life and I\u2019ve had to put up with a lot of people saying a lot of stupid stuff to me on the daily. I also have to put up with people\u2019s misconceptions of visual impairment. People think I can\u2019t do stuff when I can. So yeah, I have the patience of a saint!\n\nFriends who \u2018get it\u2019\n\nMy blind friends! I love my blind friends! They know what it\u2019s like and I think it\u2019s important for everyone to have a support network of people who just\u2026 y\u2019know\u2026 get it! It\u2019s weird to think that if I wasn\u2019t blind, I\u2019d probably would never have met those friends!\n\nProving people wrong is fun\n\nWhen you perform well in something that a visually impaired person shouldn\u2019t necessarily perform well in e.g. bowling, ice skating\u2026 finding money on the floor\u2026 the reactions you get can be pretty funny and ever so satisfying. I\u2019d be lying if I said that proving people wrong wasn\u2019t fun!", "description": "Jake Sawyers has been sight impaired all of his life.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07q0l1q.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
