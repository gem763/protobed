She\u2019s \u201cfeisty, strong and warm,\u201d she said.\n\nBelieve it or not, this was her first audition, and she landed the role.\n\nKiawenti:io\u2019s mom was the first to know about her new part, but quickly other family members found out, too.\n\n\u201cSo I called my friends and told them. I was still kind of bawling, and then we got in the car and we went to [see] my family, because they live so close\u2026. We basically opened the door and shouted \u2018I got the part!\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe carried that excitement to the set.\n\nKiawenti:io Tarbell acted alongside Amybeth McNulty, who plays Anne.

I loved it,\u201d she said.\n\nIn one scene, Kiawenti:io runs down a snowy hill with the lead character Anne to see their reflections in icy water.\n\nKiawenti:io said that moment was one of her favourites because it involved a lot of tripping and falling.\n\n\u201cIn the early 19th century, their shoes were not very grippy. They were banana skins basically, and we were running down that hill and I fell quite a lot!\u201d\n\nSpeaking of falling, Kiawenti:io has fallen in love with acting and hopes to continue in the future.\n\nAs an Indigenous actor, she is happy that a character like Ka\u2019kwet is being included in the show.\n\nKiawenti:io, who speaks Mohawk, had to learn lots about Mi\u2019kmaq culture in order to play the role, including language and tradition. (CBC)\n\nKiawenti:io said she\u2019s especially grateful that Moira Walley-Backett, the showrunner, included the actual history of Canada at the time that Anne with an E is set, which is the late 1800s.\n\n\u201cIt was true that Mi'kmaq were living on Prince Edward Island,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201c[Walley-Backett] really wanted to include every bit of history.\u201d\n\nKiawentio:io and the character of Ka\u2019kwet are introducing a whole new generation of Anne of Green Gables fans to the historical realities of the time.\n\nAdvice to teens who love to act\n\n\u201cDo not be afraid of making mistakes, try your hardest and be brave.\u201d\n\nCatch Kiawenti:io\u2019s acting debut in Anne with an E on Gem, and on CBC every Sunday at 8 p.m.\n\nKiawenti:io\u2019s Picks", "description": "Up-and-coming actor Kiawenti:io Tarbell talks with CBC Kids News about her first acting role as a Mi'kmaq girl in the series Anne with an E.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/AnneWithAnE_Indigenous_thumbnail_2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
