In simpler terms: It means lowering the cost of salaries, taxes, advertising, and other nonproduction costs.\n\nUnfortunately, it also means layoffs and store closures.", "description": "As GameStop struggles to survive, it's closing hundreds of locations and expects to close a \"much larger\" group of stores in the next year or two.", "authors": ["Ben Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d79218c2e22af075f6a209c-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
