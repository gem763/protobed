Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her district stood up to demand the congresswoman support drastic measures to combat climate change, such as \"eating babies.\"\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be here for much longer, because of the climate crisis,\" the woman pleaded. \"We only have a few months left. I love that you support the Green Deal, but it\u2019s not gonna get rid of fossil fuel. It\u2019s not going to solve the problem fast enough. A Swedish professor said we can eat dead people, but it\u2019s not fast enough! So, I think your next campaign slogan needs to be this: We\u2019ve got to start eating babies.\"\n\nMany of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s constituents appeared confused by the woman\u2019s declarations.\n\nRemoving her jacket to reveal a T-shirt with the phrase \u201cSave the planet Eat the Children,\u201d the woman continued, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a enough time. There\u2019s too much Co2.\"\n\n\"All of you!\" she went on, turning to those around her, \"You\u2019re a pollutant! Too much Co2. We have to start now. Please \u2014 you are so great. I\u2019m so happy that you are supporting a Green New Deal, but it\u2019s not enough. Even if we were to bomb Russia, it\u2019s not enough. There\u2019s too many people, too much pollution. So, we have to get rid of the babies. That\u2019s a big problem. Just stopping having babies just isn\u2019t enough. We need to eat the babies. This is very serious. Please give a response.\u201d\n\nStaffers of the New York congresswoman approached the woman toward the end of her remarks, as attendees in the room became increasingly uncomfortable.\n\nClick here for more from the Washington Examiner.", "description": "QUEENS, New York \u2014\u00a0A seemingly troubled woman at a town hall hosted by Democratic New York Rep.
