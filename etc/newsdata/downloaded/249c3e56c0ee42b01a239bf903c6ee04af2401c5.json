The reverse repo rate INRREP=ECI was reduced to 4.9%. economy grew by just 5% in the June quarter, its slowest pace in more than five years, prompting the government to take measures aimed at boosting growth.\n\nA sharp cut in the corporate tax rate - to 22% from 30% - last month brought cheer to markets, but economists say the move will do little to address a lack of spending power.\n\nLeading stock indexes lower after the interest rate cut on Friday were banks, which have already suffered bruising declines in recent sessions.\n\nThe Nifty banks index was last down 0.88%, with Federal Bank Ltd's 3% drop leading losses on the index.\n\nIndia's state-run banks were faring better, with the Nifty PSU banks index that tracks them rising 0.06%.", "description": "UPDATE 1-Indian shares lose ground, bond yields rise as cenbank cuts rates", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEAA60AX_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
