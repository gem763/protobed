Smollett is pictured right\n\nFormer Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, (right), and Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, (left), speak after prosecutors dropped all charges against Jussie Smollett in March. Smollett was under investigation for claiming he was attacked by masked men in January\n\nThe police conducted an exhaustive investigation that included nearly 1,900 hours of overtime as they looked into Smollett's claim that he was beaten by two masked men on a downtown Chicago street in January.\n\nIt was also claimed that the men used racist and homophobic slurs and looped a noose around his neck before fleeing.\n\nFor days, detectives scoured the neighborhood for witnesses, analyzed dozens of videos from surveillance cameras on the street, on buildings and inside taxi cabs.\n\nThey also interviewed store owners in search of who might have sold the suspects the rope.\n\nWhen Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson announced charges against Smollett, he angrily made clear the stakes of the investigation and why it was so important that police solve the case, saying that Smollett 'took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.'\n\nIn March, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx's office announced a stunning decision to drop the 16 felony counts related to making a false report.\n\nThe announcement angered Johnson and then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel and led to the city's lawsuit against Smollett and to a county judge's decision to appoint a special prosecutor to examine the way Foxx's office handled the investigation.\n\nIllinois Cook County Judge Michael Toomin last month appointed a special counsel to investigate the case.\n\nThe probe by Judge Toomin into why charges against Smollett were dropped will not only will investigate how the Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx and her office handled the case, but determine whether the Empire actor should be further prosecuted for allegedly staging the 'hoax' hate crime.\n\nThe police conducted an exhaustive investigation that included nearly 1,900 hours of overtime as they looked into Smollett's claim that he was beaten by two masked men on a downtown Chicago street in January. He is pictured with his attorney Tina Glandian in March\n\nIn March, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, (pictured), announced a stunning decision to drop the 16 felony counts related to Smollett making a false report\n\nAlthough Smollett has maintained his innocence, the police department is adamant that there is a mountain of evidence that shows Smollett staged the attack with two brothers he knew.\n\n\n\nTwo bodybuilders, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, reportedly told police Smollett paid them $3,500 to carry out the attack and that he also told them where to buy the rope that was put around his neck.\n\nAn attorney representing two brothers at the center of a probe into the 'assault' on Jussie Smollett said they received 'some money' from the Empire actor.\n\nIn February, Ola and Abel Osundairo met with a grand jury impaneled to investigate Smollett\u2019s now-disputed claims that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack.\n\nSmollett has maintained his innocence, but the police department is adamant that there is a mountain of evidence that shows Smollett staged the attack with two brothers he knew\n\nTwo Nigerian bodybuilders, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, reportedly told police Smollett paid them $3,500 to carry out the attack and that he also told them where to buy the rope that was put around his neck\n\nWithout providing details, she said the two men accepted money from Smollett and wanted to come clean. She said they weren't motivated by any promises from prosecutors.\n\nShe told reporters: 'There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said: \"We're gonna correct this.\"\n\n'Plea deal, immunity, all of that \u2014 they don't' care about that.'\n\nThe brothers are of Nigerian descent. But they told a reporter at CBS2-Chicago that they were 'born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.'\n\nIt is understood that they previously told police that the Empire actor helped create the threatening letter he received at his studio, a week before the alleged attack, according to reports.\n\nEarlier this month, Smollett hit back at a social media post comparing him to a schoolgirl who made up a story about how she was pinned down and had her dreadlocks cut off by white classmates.\n\nSelf-help internet star, Derrick Jackson, posted a comment on Instagram comparing the former Empire actor to Amari Allen, who alleged three white boys hacked off her hair and later retracted the claims.\n\nInternet self-help guru, Derrick Jackson (right), compared actor Jussie Smollett to Amari Allen's (left) retracted attack claims that she was pinned down and had her dreadlocks cut\n\nJussie Smollett replied to Derrick Jackson's Instagram comment, saying he 'hadn't lied about a thing' after he was accused of being a 'trendsetter'\n\nSmollett then fired back in a lengthy post, claiming he 'hadn't lied about a thing', when he alleged two men attacked him in a racial and homophobic assault.\n\nSmollett was insistent that the attack took place, hitting back at Jackson for saying 'Jussie really is a trendsetter' in response to a story about 12-year-old Amari Allen's admission that three white classmates did not attack her.\n\nSmollett then replied around an hour later: 'With all due respect brother, y'all can clown me all you want but my story has actually never changed and I haven't lied about a thing.\n\n'Y'all can continue to be misinformed, internalized sheep, who believe what actual proven liars feed you or you can read the actual docs. Either way, Imma be alright. I know me and what happened. You don't. So carry on. All love.'\n\nAmari Allen claimed she was held down by three white boys who cut her hair off at their Christian $12,000-a-year school, where Mike Pence's wife Karen works as a teacher part-time.\n\nBut later the child's family issued a statement saying it was false and apologized to the boys. Why the claims were fabricated remains unclear.\n\nThe family asked for forgiveness in their statement and said they had 'betrayed the wider community.'", "description": "CHICAGO (AP) - A federal judge on Tuesday refused to dismiss Chicago's lawsuit against former", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Leah Mcdonald For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/17/20045136-0-image-a-61_1571762289769.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
