The South African Weather Service issued a statement last week, warning of persistent heat wave conditions over the north-eastern parts of South Africa including Gauteng, Limpopo, Free State and Mpumalanga, despite \u201ctypical Winter days\u201d blowing over the south-western parts.\n\nParts of Cape Town were recently flooded following a heavy downpour of rain, but Gauteng remains hot and dry.\n\nClick on the images below to see each province:\n\nRand Water, which supplies water to Gauteng, parts of Mpumalanga, North West and Free State, has come under strain following the dry weather patterns with water levels in the Vaal Dam dropping to below 50%.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m informed by advisors that the earliest we can expect rain at the rate at which we want to is December,\u201d Sisulu said.\n\nReferring to a media report which stated that the minister was \u201cpassing the buck\u201d when it came to the issue of water supply in the country, Sisulu dismissed the report by saying: \u201cI\u2019m not sure who the buck is or who it is being passed to. It is certainly not the case and we face it fully,\u201d she said.\n\nSisulu said that there would be future briefings taking place across the country in order to deal with the matter of water scarcity.\n\nRand Water has begun to impose restrictions on water use, with the minister cautioning against panic, and instead offering cautionary measures which should be exercised by municipalities in order to adhere to the restrictions.\n\n\u201cThe situation is very serious, however it is not one that calls for panic. It is under control,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cGlobal water stress surveys place us as high on the list ... We face high water stress right now\u2026 All of us as water users have to handle the limited water resources we have in a sustainable way,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to the minister, a master plan is under way to ensure that a shortage of water is augmented.\n\nCEO of Rand Water Sipho Mosai said that water consumption had shot up from an average of 4,368 mega-litres a day to 5,000 mega-litres a day.\n\n\u201cAt this stage we cannot be using water for anything other than drinking. If we reduce the demand, we should be fine,\u201d Mosai added.\n\nHowever, Ngwezi, criticised the minister\u2019s briefing, saying that the country\u2019s water woes cannot only be blamed on weather and changes within our climate, but corruption, a lack of water management and a crisis in infrastructure and skills must be addressed.\n\n\u201cFor far too long has the ANC overlooked the importance of regular maintenance of bulk water infrastructure as was the case in the past by Minister Sisulu\u2019s predecessor, Nomvula Mokonyane\u2019s so-called \u2018War on Leaks\u2019 project,\u201d Ngwezi said.\n\n\u201cWe implore Minister Sisulu to walk her talk on the proposed master plan. South Africans are tired of hearing new plans from government when the plans lack the will for implementation.\u201d", "description": "The recently unveiled master plan to deal with the water crisis is inadequate \u2013 the government needs to realise that corruption, a lack of water management and a crisis in infrastructure and skills must be addressed.", "authors": ["Staff Reporter"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7189/705f01108af1458893b8dcf7c2c4fbc5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
