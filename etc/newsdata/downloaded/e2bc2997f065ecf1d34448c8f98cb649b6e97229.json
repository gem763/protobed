Cove / Splash News)\n\nShe told The Sun Online : \"I'm a completely different person these days. I've done so much growing up.\n\n\"I know people see me as Mental Megs - if I'd watched me, I'd think, 'Oh Godm I don't like her.'\n\n\"But the truth is I was just a broken, upset young girl and I didn't really know what I was getting myself in to.\"\n\nOn her drinking, Megan revealed: \"I realised I didn't want to be doing that any more.I would go and get paralytic. I'm talking downing Jagerbombs like you would not believe. I don't know how I did it.\n\n\"I was necking them three in a line, tequila, Sambuca...and I was waking up in the morning with my face all swollen from the alcohol. I'm coeliac and I'd constantly have a bed belly from a night out.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"Some nights I'd go to the toilet,be sick and then go back and carry on drinking.\n\n\"I was abusing my body.\"\n\nTherapy has also been key for Megan in helping her move away from her destructive beahviour.\n\nOn body image, Megan is embarrassed to look back at old photos, and has since has her lips fillers dissolved.\n\n(Image: Rex Features)\n\nShe said: \"I'm mortified looking back at some of my old pictures. I spent three years pumping it in, thinking, 'They're not big enough let's get some more.'\n\n\"I became obsessed with my lips. I'd take a photo of myself and if I didn't think they looked big enough Id make them bigger with an editing app.\n\n\"Honestly, I think I had body dysmorphia, because when I look back at pictures of myself now I'm horrified. I look like a duck.\n\n\"I don't know how they didn't bump into things! I can't believe what I looked like.\"\n\nShe's had an especially rough time since early 2018, when her ex-boyfriend Mike Thalassitis took his own life.\n\nMegan's decided to keep her feelings about the tragedy private, and doesn't discuss it publicly.", "description": "Megan is preparing to launch a music career off the back off her X Factor appearance, which is the latest step in her self-reinvention", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Mike Marsland Wireimage", "Brett D.
