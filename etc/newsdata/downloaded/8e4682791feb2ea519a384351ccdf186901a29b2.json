Six years later, she still gets teary talking about it.\n\n\u201cEverybody thinks money is the answer, and here I had all this money, and all I could think about was not getting it right,\u201d she said.\n\nGrant, 53, was a middle-school teacher in Michigan when she inherited the money.\n\nParalyzed with fear, she became convinced that any move she made would not only destroy her father\u2019s legacy but ruin her children\u2019s and grandchildren\u2019s future. She suffered through stomach pains, couldn\u2019t get herself out of bed and lost interest in daily activities. The money weighed on her every thought.\n\nHelp finally came, not from a financial adviser or a psychologist, but a combination of the two: a financial therapist. The treatment helped her uncover the root of her turmoil: Her father had raised her to believe she didn\u2019t know how to handle money, so the inheritance felt like a trap, something she would never be able to manage.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have a financial therapist to help me manage the inner chaos and stress, I would have imploded,\u201d Grant said.\n\nAnd though her circumstances are unusual \u2014 few Americans attain her wealth \u2014 Grant believes financial therapy can help anyone. Because it isn\u2019t just about how much you have; it\u2019s about your beliefs and feelings toward money. And, boy, do we have a lot of them. Money is, after all, the thing that stresses out Americans more than anything else, according to a 2018 survey \u2014 as it has been every year since the American Psychological Association started posing the question in 2007.\n\n\u2018Only about 20% of financial planning clients respond to logic and education.\u2019 Rick Kahler, financial adviser\n\nIn Grant\u2019s case, financial therapy helped her overcome her paralysis and escape self-defeating behaviors such as refusing to look at credit-card statements or avoiding asking her bookkeeper to pay bills.\n\n\u201cFinancial therapy helps me with the emotional and the behavioral side of making decisions around money,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat is financial therapy?\n\nFinancial therapy sits at the intersection of financial advice and psychoanalysis. It\u2019s therapy that helps people uncover the source of emotions guiding their money decisions and, in the process, end self-destructive behaviors related to money.\n\n\u201cA person can benefit from financial therapy when their behaviors are not in line with their values,\u201d said Rick Kahler, a Rapid City, S.D.\u2013based financial adviser whose firm, Kahler Financial Group, has employed for the past eight years a financial therapist who is both a certified financial planner (CFP) and a clinical mental-health counselor. \u201cAnother way to say that is when someone is stuck or when someone knows I should be doing this \u2014 I should be saving, I should be spending less, I should be paying attention to my retirement \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nKahler considers a team that includes both therapists and financial planners to be the gold standard for financial-advisory services.\n\nCertifiable\n\nThough it\u2019s been around in various forms since the 1990s, financial therapy is now poised to become more standardized and more prevalent. Until now, the occupation has been loosely defined, and anyone could call themselves a financial therapist.\n\nThe field encompasses a range of professionals \u2014 from psychotherapists to marriage counselors to social workers to certified financial planners \u2014 all looking to help clients understand the emotional underpinnings of their behaviors around money. Starting this year, practitioners will be able to be certified by the Princeton Junction, N.J.\u2013based Financial Therapy Association as a financial therapist after taking a 100-question exam and meeting requirements including logging 500 hours of experience.\n\nDemand for financial therapy is poised to grow, said Debra Kaplan, a Tucson, Ariz.\u2013based licensed mental-health therapist, speaker and author of \u201cFor Love and Money: Exploring Sexual & Financial Betrayal in Relationships.\u201d Kaplan has an MBA and first got interested in the psychology of money while working as a commodity options trader on Wall Street. This past decade of stock-market prosperity has coincided with the rise of a generation that is open to self-reflection, she\u2019s observed.\n\n\u201cThis is a generation that is introspective by nature because of wanting a work trajectory that is self-gratifying and satisfying, not just a paycheck,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cTherefore, financial therapy is perhaps coming into its own at a time that has a demographic that would benefit from what it has to offer: delving into money and work and what it means.\u201d\n\nAnd as traditional financial planning becomes increasingly automated, with investors relying on robo-advisers and index funds, and talk of artificial intelligence helping clients make asset allocations, Kahler sees a bright future for financial therapy.\n\n\u201cThe financial-planning profession gives lip service to the fact that it\u2019s about the relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think emotional issues are going away. To be relevant, the financial-planning profession needs to embrace financial therapy.\u201d\n\nThe case for financial therapy\n\nAfter nearly 40 years in the financial-advisory business, Kahler, 64, has come to the conclusion that only about 20% of financial-planning clients respond to logic and education. That small minority will, for example, stop overspending if an adviser tells them to. But, for most people, \u201cit goes way deeper,\u201d he said, and they need more than monthly budgets to change their behavior.\n\nKahler sees a parallel with dieting. We\u2019re bombarded with information about calorie counts and daily walking steps to stay fit, but most Americans are still overweight. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the money,\u201d Kahler said. \u201cThe money is a symptom of a deeper problem. Until we get down to that emotional issue, the behavior isn\u2019t going to change. You\u2019re just putting a Band-Aid on it.\u201d\n\nTraditional financial planning is not equipped to address that reality. In fact, financial planners call clients who don\u2019t do what they\u2019re told \u201cnoncompliant,\u201d Kahler noted.\n\nA financial therapist, on the other hand, will help someone uncover why they can\u2019t seem to get around to opening those 401(k) statements; why they continually overspend on their credit card, even when they\u2019ve promised themselves they wouldn\u2019t do it again; why they have plenty of money and yet won\u2019t spend any of it to repair their dilapidated house or car; why every fight with their spouse seems to be about the household budget; why they\u2019re losing sleep about money and can\u2019t seem to focus; or why they have a secret bank account they\u2019ve never told their spouse about.\n\nHow it works\n\nTackling people\u2019s issues around money with a financial therapist is different in every case, but it often involves examining a client\u2019s core beliefs about money and how they came to hold them. Do they chase money? Are they terrified of running out of money? Is their sense of self-worth tied up in how many figures are in their salary? Do they avoid thinking and talking about money at all costs? Do they think money is irrelevant? Often the discussion will lead back to childhood, when our parents taught us, either consciously or unconsciously, what and how to think about money.\n\nThose \u201cstories\u201d about money are sometimes called \u201cmoney scripts,\u201d a term coined by Brad and Ted Klontz, a father-and-son team of financial psychologists. Ted Klontz is Sheri Reid Grant\u2019s financial therapist. One of her money scripts \u2014 that women don\u2019t know how to manage money \u2014 was reinforced every Christmas when she was growing up in Michigan. Her father, an industrial engineer by training, made his fortune after buying a manufacturing company outside Detroit that made automotive parts. Her three brothers worked for the business, but Grant didn\u2019t. At Christmas, the family would gather to open presents, an event that culminated with her dad opening a box of envelopes and handing out distribution checks to her brothers.\n\nThe message \u2014 that she didn\u2019t know how to handle money \u2014 later fueled her \u201cmoney avoidance,\u201d which manifested in Grant refusing to look at, for example, credit-card statements. Money scripts may seem irrational to an outsider, but for the person living them they are completely logical. Identifying them helps clients recognize the roots of their money-related anxieties, and eventually, it\u2019s hoped, end their harmful financial behaviors.\n\nThere\u2019s no exact formula for helping a client change behavior; financial therapy is more art than science, Kaplan said. But as the saying goes, \u201cIf you can name it, you can tame it,\u201d so Kaplan will sometimes have clients make an inventory, in writing, of exactly what they feel when they take money-related actions that they want to change.\n\nA client who was going into debt to lend his friends money because he felt it was his duty to rescue them might write down that when he gives a specific friend money, he feels he\u2019s a good friend; when he doesn\u2019t, he feels sad and guilty. In therapy, that client may come to realize his lending habit is more about his own self-esteem, and Kaplan would help him find healthier ways to foster self-esteem. \u201cI\u2019m not going to reprimand them, but I want them to notice what comes up when they engage in that behavior,\u201d Kaplan said.\n\n\u2018They thought we were a cult\u2019\n\nThe origins of financial therapy date to the mid-1990s, when a leaderless group of financial planners \u2014 they came from across the country and first met as a group in Colorado \u2014 called the Nazrudin Project began gathering once a year to discuss the intersection of emotions and money. The rest of the financial-planning field balked. \u201cThey thought we were a cult,\u201d Kahler remembers. \u201cPlanners just did not feel that the financial-planning profession had any business mucking around with emotion.\u201d\n\nCompared with the country\u2019s 85,000 CFPs, the Financial Therapy Association\u2019s 300-plus members, including 32 outside the U.S., form a small, but rapidly growing, group of practitioners.\n\nThere is still some debate about the best way to bridge therapy and financial planning. Financial therapists now come from one of two \u201chome disciplines\u201d \u2014 either the financial-planning field or mental-health counseling. But a certified financial planner who offers financial therapy is not equipped to treat people coping with serious mental-health problems, and a psychotherapist shouldn\u2019t give investment advice, said Alex Melkumian, a Los Angeles\u2013based licensed marriage and family therapist who offers financial therapy.\n\n\u201cFor your money, you want a fiduciary,\u201d he said. \u201cFor your emotional health, you want a licensed psychologist or therapist who knows how to treat the diagnoses you have and respects confidentiality.\u201d\n\nTherapists should not be handing out financial-planning advice or telling clients what investments to buy, he said. Clients can idealize their therapists and try to please them. \u201cImagine if I\u2019m saying you have to invest in this particular fund, or this is a strategy that will work for you 110%, and then it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Melkumian said. \u201cThere would be resentment between them and me as the therapist, and it would cloud the treatment and make it ineffective.\u201d\n\nSome financial therapists post disclaimers explaining they can\u2019t treat acute mental-health disorders; others say upfront that they won\u2019t give investment advice. One possible solution to this conundrum is to have therapists and financial planners work side-by-side with the same clients, a strategy that Melkumian and Kahler, among others, advocate.\n\n\u201cWhen you start playing in the area of mental health, ethics and transparency and intention is so important,\u201d Kahler said. \u201cPeople are more vulnerable about money than anything else, so it absolutely screams for integrity from the providers.\u201d\n\nUnder the Financial Therapy Association\u2019s new certification program, certified financial therapists will be fiduciaries and must adhere to an ethical code that includes avoiding \u201ccontrolling financial elements of the client\u2019s life that may interfere with doing what is in the client\u2019s best interest.\u201d They won\u2019t be allowed to sell financial products.\n\nDoes financial therapy work?\n\nThe field is so new that there hasn\u2019t been a lot of research on its effectiveness. One 2018 study by professors at Kansas State University found that 13 couples who were taught a \u201clove and money\u201d curriculum \u2014 techniques similar to what they might encounter in financial therapy \u2014 felt happier and less stressed about money afterward, and reported significant reductions in money-related stress when they were interviewed three months later.\n\nBut true-believer clients like Sheri Reid Grant don\u2019t need research to convince them of the benefits.\n\n\u201cThe financial issues I struggle with are universal,\u201d Grant said. \u201cThe only difference is a few zeros at the end of my net worth.\u201d\n\nShe said therapy can be emotionally taxing, but she sticks with it in part because of her children: \u201cI feel a huge responsibility to break the chains of family dysfunction around money instead of passing them on to my kids.\u201d", "description": "Starting this year, it will be possible to be officially certified as a financial therapist.", "authors": ["Leslie Albrecht", "Personal Finance Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ661_BNIM_T_ZG_20190904112842.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
