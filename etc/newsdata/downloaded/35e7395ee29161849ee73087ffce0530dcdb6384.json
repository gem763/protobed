It went from an online joke, to something that prompted action from both the US military and Facebook, to a potential disaster for the people who are intending to turn up after all.\n\nHow did this all happen?\n\nThe event began as a joke. That much was clear from the description, which referenced an anime character and suggested people would be able to outrun bullets.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

These so-called red giants then begin to lose their outer layers of material into space. More than half of such a star's mass can be shed in this manner, forming a shell of surrounding gas. At the same time, the star's core shrinks and grows hotter, emitting ultraviolet light that causes the expelled gases to glow.

Lets see them aliens.\u201d\n\nThe page developed in the same comedic manner, playing host to a variety of jokes and memes that sarcastically riffed on aliens and the secrets of the government.\n\nBut it very quickly became very serious indeed. As interest in the Facebook page grew, so did anxiety that some people might really try to break into the base \u2013 and US Air Force spokesperson Laura McAndrews was one of a number of officials who gave a stern warning to anyone who did.\n\n\u201c[Area 51] is an open training range for the US Air Force, and we would discourage anyone from trying to come into the area where we train American armed forces,\u201d she said.\n\nMs McAndrews added: \u201cThe US Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets\u201d.\n\nLast month, the event disappeared from Facebook. It wasn\u2019t clear exactly why, and at the point it was removed more than two million people had indicated they would take part.\n\nIt was particularly frustrating for organiser Mr Roberts because he had attempted to parlay the interest into a real event: the equally ill-fated Alienstock. Rather than raiding Area 51, that woud be a festival devoted to the culture that surrounds it, attempting to harness people\u2019s interest in the moment into something organised and profitable, rather than potentially lethal.\n\nWhat\u2019s the plan now?\n\nThere are now three different major events planned, with a number of others likely. It\u2019s not clear how many people will be arriving in Nevada to take part in them.\n\nTwo of the main ones are now called Alienstock, after some confusion and disagreement between the people organising them. One will happen in Las Vegas, and appears to be something like a more traditional EDM festival; the other is taking place in the tiny town of Rachel, Nevada, in the heart of Area 51-country.\n\nIt\u2019s that event in particular that has led locals to \u201cprepare for the worst\u201d. Rachel is a tiny town, with a population of around 54, which is only about twice the number of musical acts advertised as performing at the event.\n\nLast month, the town\u2019s official website posted a warning indicating that the event has a \u201chigh potential to get ugly\u201d. The town and the harsh desert that surrounds it has few places for anyone to stay, is subject to wildly fluctuating temperatures, is home to dangerous animals and the local area has no internet, phone signal or credit card facilities.\n\nThose warnings are still continuing as the weekend begins. This week, local Joerg Arnu said that people did not know what they were getting themselves in for.\n\n\u201cThose that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time,\u201d Arnu said. \u201cThose who are looking for a big party are going to be disappointed.\u201d\n\nHe predicts people showing up in the desert in shorts and flip-flops.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t protect you against critters, snakes and scorpions,\u201d Arnu said. \u201cIt will get cold at night. They\u2019re not going to find what they\u2019re looking for, and they are going to get angry.\u201d", "description": "It is 20 September.
