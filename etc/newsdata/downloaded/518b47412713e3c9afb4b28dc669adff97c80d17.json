Twitter staff secured Dorsey's account within 30 minutes by removing the phone number attached to the CEO's account.\n\nThe SMS-to-tweet feature is one of Twitter's oldest components and one which many have said helped the site gain its early popularty.\n\nA lesser known fact is that the initial tweet limit of 140 characters was put in place so tweets could fit inside the SMS messages that powered the SMS-to-tweet feature.", "description": "Twitter disables one of the site's earliest features in response to CEO getting hacked last week.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/09/19/a1677830-59a9-4007-9acc-b6bcc96d5d78/thumbnail/770x578/aecdf9e393f62fe2607a1c89c2d1ff04/twitter.jpg"}
