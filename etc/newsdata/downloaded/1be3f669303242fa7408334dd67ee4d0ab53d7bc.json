A sheriff's statement says the wounded dachshund, since named Buddy, was found in a trailer park and brought to a veterinarian, who contacted authorities.\n\nDeputies say the woman and her daughter failed to get Buddy medical care after reporting in February that he had been shot and paralyzed.\n\nThe owners said Buddy's legs became infected and later fell off because they were bandaged too tightly. But the vet said the legs were \"maliciously removed.\"\n\nThe girl's friend is accused of abandoning the dog.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
