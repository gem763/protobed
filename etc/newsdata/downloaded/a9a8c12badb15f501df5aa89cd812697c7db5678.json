But, he has been criticized of not acting enough on those words.\n\nThat could soon change.\n\nThe pope created Tuesday the Commission for the Study of the Diaconate of Women. In a statement, the Vatican announced the 13 members of the commission, referencing comments by the pope in May that a study of the history of female deacons would benefit the church.\n\nThe Vatican's announcement has led to speculation over whether the \"People\u2019s Pontiff\" will be the first to bring the church in line with contemporary attitudes about women. While conservatives worry female deacons would be a \u201cslippery slope\u201d to women in the priesthood, others argue it\u2019s about time the church caught up to other major Christian denominations in opening up their leadership to women.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s way overdue,\u201d says Susan Ross, a theology professor at Loyola University Chicago, and past president of the Catholic Theological Society of America. \u201cThe second wave of the women\u2019s movement is over 50 years old,\u201d she says, adding women were ordained in major Protestant denominations starting around that time.\n\n\u201cThe diaconate would be affirming what women already do. Women have so many roles of service in the church, but have no official status,\u201d she continues, in a phone interview with The Christian Science Monitor. \u201cTo give women an official status is, I think, way, way, way overdue.\u201d\n\nThe Vatican did not elaborate on whether the commission will focus on just the history of women in the diaconate, or if it will consider a future with female deacons. Composed of seven men, and six women, the commission will include priests, nuns, and professors, but no deacons. Archbishop Luis Francisco Ladaria Ferrer, secretary of the body responsible for Catholic doctrine, will lead the commission. Also named to it is Phyllis Zagano, a professor at Hofstra University. Dr. Zagano has written at length on the history of the diaconate, including the book, \u201cHoly Saturday: An Argument for the Restoration of the Female Diaconate in the Catholic Church.\u201d\n\nThough deacons can't hear confessions or consecrate the Eucharist, they can perform many other functions that priests can, including officiating weddings, baptisms, and funerals. Currently, only married or celibate men over 35 are eligible for the diaconate.\n\nThe church does have a history of female deacons, from Phoebe in the First Testament to the Middle Ages, when the diaconate faded as a separate order, writes Dr. Zagano, in a 2015 article for Harvard Divinity School\u2019s summer bulletin.\n\nThe Second Vatican Council reintroduced the diaconate in the 1960s, but limited the position to just men. Still, the question of expanding the diaconate or priesthood to women has lingered.\n\nIn 1994, Pope John Paul II shut the book on women in the priesthood. He issued a four-paragraph apostolic letter, Ordinatio Sacerdotalis, that affirmed the church's previous determination that it did not have the authority to ordain women as priests. But the letter didn\u2019t address female deacons, leaving the subject open to argument.\n\nMeanwhile, a commission was studying women as deacons. That commission, active from 1992 to 1997, published a study that Zagano writes appeared to approve women as deacons. But, then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) refused to sign it. And a second commission published in 2002 a document that inconclusively addressed women in the diaconate.\n\nThe debate resurfaced in May, when, during a meeting with Pope Francis, leaders of female Catholic religious orders told Francis \u201cthat women had served as deacons in the early church and asked: \u2018Why not construct an official commission that might study the question?\u2019 \u201d according to the National Catholic Reporter.\n\nThe pontiff replied: \u201cIt would do good for the church to clarify this point.\u201d He later added, \u201cI accept. It seems useful to me to have a commission that would clarify this well.\u201d\n\nAfter the media reported the Pope was considering expanding the diaconate to women, the Vatican quickly clarified. Even the pope was critical in June of the media's response. \u201cThey said: \u2018The Church opens the door to deaconesses.\u2019 Really? I am a bit angry because this is not telling the truth of things,\u201d he said, according to Catholic News Agency.\n\nChurch conservatives worry female deacons are a \"slippery slope\" to women in higher leadership positions, Candida Moss, a professor of the New Testament and early Christianity at the University of Notre Dame, told the Monitor in May.\n\n\u201cMany in the Church hierarchy would not want the people to begin seeing women in liturgical vesture and roles that would gradually lead them to ask, \u2018Well, why can\u2019t women also consecrate the Blessed Sacrament at Mass?\u2019\" wrote Dr. Moss, in an email to the Monitor.\n\nThe pope, too, has been criticized of making conflicting comments about women. Although he has repeatedly spoken about expanding the role of women in the church, he also made headlines in December when he said women theologians are the \u201cstrawberry on the cake.\u201d\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

But Zagano at Hofstra expressed optimism in an interview with The Washington Post Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe dignity of women to be recognized as able to minister as part of the ordained diaconate \u2013 to recognize that dignity is world-changing,\u201d said Zagano. \u201cI think it really speaks specifically to the way the church views women.", "description": "The Vatican did not say if the commission will study the history of women in the diaconate or a future with female deacons.", "authors": ["The Christian Science Monitor", "Ben Rosen"], "top_image": "https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2016/08/995694_1_0802-Pope_standard.png?alias=standard_900x600", "published_at": "2016-08-02"}
