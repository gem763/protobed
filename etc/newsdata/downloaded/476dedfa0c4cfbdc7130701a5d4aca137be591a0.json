You can deduce what kind of person it is based on that activity,\" he told a news conference.\n\n\"That would be my empirical observation of what he did. I'm not able to confirm anything else about his last seconds. I just can't confirm that one way or another.\"\n\nGen McKenzie said four women - who were wearing suicide vests - and one man were killed at the compound.\n\nHe said an unknown number of fighters also died after opening fire on US helicopters.\n\nHe added: \"I want to make it clear that despite the high-pressure and high-profile nature of this assault that every effort was made to avoid civilian casualties and to protect children we suspected would be in the compound.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Security correspondent Frank Gardner: \"He has symbolised the leadership of so-called Islamic State\"\n\nGen McKenzie confirmed that the IS leader had been identified through his DNA - adding that samples had been on file since Baghdadi's detention in an Iraqi prison in 2004.\n\nHe said Baghdadi's remains were flown back to a staging base for identification and were then buried at sea within 24 hours of his death \"in accordance with the laws of armed conflict\".", "description": "Grainy footage shows troops closing in on the compound where the fugitive IS leader was holed up.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07sk7w8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
