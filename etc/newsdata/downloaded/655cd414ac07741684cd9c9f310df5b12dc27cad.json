It also added that its data centres are located outside of China and none of its data is subject to Chinese law.\n\n\"TikTok does not remove content based on sensitivities related to China. We have never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content and we would not do so if asked,\" the company said.\n\n\"We are not influenced by any foreign government, including the Chinese government; TikTok does not operate in China, nor do we have any intention of doing so in the future.\"\n\nLast week, TikTok announced it had hired global law firm K&L Gates LLP, including two former US congressmen Bart Gordon and Jeff Denham, to review its content moderation policies in a bid to further strengthen the platform's moderation policies and overall transparency.\n\nTikTok made the external hires to \"further increase transparency around our content moderation policies and the practices we employ to protect our community,\" Vanessa Pappas, TikTok's US general manager, said at the time.\n\nThe call for an investigation on TikTok comes off the back of Senator Marco Rubio at the start of the month claiming that the popular app has been trying to censor content in US in order to be in line with the interests of the Chinese government.\n\n\"[Chinese apps] are increasingly being used to censor content and silence open discussion on topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese Government and Communist Party,\" Rubio said at the time.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nTikTok opens Indian data centre in wake of accusations of hosting pornographers and sexual predators\n\nIndia has become TikTok's most prized and fastest growing market and one that it cannot afford to lose, hence the announcement that it will set up a local data centre.\n\nGoogle and Apple asked to remove China's TikTok in India: Report\n\nThe decision follows reports that Foxconn is looking to expand manufacturing operations in India.\n\nYouTube policy on removing 'instructional hacking' content causes infosec community outrage\n\nVideos removed from a prominent educational channel brought the policy to light.
