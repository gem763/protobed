Do they know all the details of their portfolios? And what are their policy ideas going forward?\n\nThat's what the members of parliament wanted to find out.\n\nYet some nominees were struggling.\n\nBrexit\n\nThe hearings did something extraordinary: they overshadowed the ongoing Brexit saga.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson presented a last-minute proposal to the EU to end the stalemate that the British have created.\n\nIt's all about the tricky Irish border situation and whether there should be controls or not \u2013 the infamous backstop.\n\nTurns out Johnson cannot square the circle. His proposal was considered just cosmetics and was therefore shut down by EU officials.\n\nCouncil president Donald Tusk tweeted that the EU is still standing fully behind Ireland and that Johnson did not convince Brussels.\n\nSimilar comments came from Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\nJuncker, by the way, also had strong words after the WTO ruled that the United States was entitled to punitive tariffs in retaliation of European Airbus subsidies.\n\nSpeaking at a gala reception hosted by the American ambassador, here's what Juncker had to say:\n\n\u201cWe will always defend free and fair trade based on a level playing field and reciprocity. We will not be naive, but we are ready, willing and determined to business. And if someone is imposing tariffs on our aviation sector, we'll do exactly the same.\u201d\n\nCircus\n\nAs we see every week, politics can be quite entertaining.\n\nBut don't say that politics is like a circus.\n\nThat would be demeaning to an honorable industry.\n\nThe European Parliament believes that the circus business should get more attention and be taken really seriously.\n\nNext week\n\nOn Monday, the hearings of the EU Commissioners-designate continue with Vera Jourova and Josep Borrell.\n\nOn Tuesday, the EU Interior ministers meet in Luxembourg to deal with immigration.\n\nAnd on Thursday the Swedish Academy announces two Nobel prize laureates for literature, one for 2018 and one for 2019 following last year's internal controversy.", "description": "In this edition we look at how Commissioners-to-be had a delicate balancing act as MEPs grilled them on their possible portfolios and how new Brexit plans launched a new blame game. From political circus acts to real ones, we look at how European circuses want to be taken more seriously.", "authors": ["Stefan Grobe"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/68/74/1000x563_cmsv2_bbb96c71-3df8-5912-9b9f-5d84a347363f-4206874.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
