While GOP lawmakers have been skittish about directly engaging the subject at the heart of the impeachment debate \u2014 the president\u2019s conduct with his Ukrainian counterpart \u2014 many have felt free to loudly condemn Trump\u2019s Syria decision, underscoring the fluidity within GOP ranks.\n\nAD\n\nConsider Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), one of Trump\u2019s most loyal defenders, whose Twitter feed has neatly illustrated this dynamic this week. In the span of 15 hours, he parroted Trump\u2019s points by accusing House Democrats of \u201cdestroying\u201d the Constitution with their impeachment proceedings and condemned the Trump administration for having \u201cshamelessly abandoned\u201d Kurdish allies. \u201cThis move ensures the reemergence of ISIS,\u201d Graham added.\n\nOr consider Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), a member of her party\u2019s leadership, who backed up the president last week by tweeting that the impeachment probe was \u201cstarting to seem like a political set up.\u201d On Wednesday, she issued a scorching statement: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northern Syria is having sickening and predictable consequences.\u201d\n\nAlthough there is always a risk in breaking with a president who demands absolute loyalty from within his party, many Republicans feel far safer doing so on more distant issues of foreign policy, where Trump often finds himself outside of his party\u2019s historic positioning, such as Syria, than on matters that personally affect Trump, such as impeachment, according to party officials and strategists.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe complexity with Syria, Turkey and the Kurds is beyond the normal person\u2019s understanding,\u201d former North Carolina governor Pat McCrory (R) said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those issues that seems to be important, but no one understands the complexities. All you hear is, \u2018Trump might have made a mistake there,\u2019 but not much more than that.\u201d\n\nThe Syria issue, McCrory said, is \u201cnot personal for most Trump supporters. It\u2019s a foreign policy disagreement.\u201d\n\nMichael Steel, a former GOP House leadership adviser, explained that, over the past three years, lawmakers have been \u201ctesting the boundaries of the president\u2019s tolerance for dissent.\u201d\n\nOn policy disagreements, he said, \u201cYou see a great deal more latitude. You don\u2019t see angry tweet storms about Republicans who voted for sanctions on Russia. The disagreement over Syria has stayed in that bucket.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump defended his move to pull out of the Syrian conflict during a lengthy question-and-answer session with reporters at the White House on Wednesday. He argued that Americans had long tired of the \u201cendless wars\u201d overseas and that \u201ceventually somebody was going to have to make the decision.\u201d\n\nRecounting a past visit to watch the bodies of fallen soldiers returned to the United States, the president recalled that family members sometimes \u201crun to the coffin. They\u2019ll break through military barriers, they\u2019ll run to the coffin and jump on top of the coffin, crying, mothers and wives, crying desperately. And this is on these endless wars that just never stop.\u201d\n\nTrump has largely shrugged off complaints this week from top allies, including prominent evangelical Christians, about his Syria decision, refraining \u2014 at least so far \u2014 from the Twitter taunts and put-downs with which he usually responds to criticism. Asked about Graham\u2019s comments, Trump was uncharacteristically restrained.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLindsey and I feel differently,\u201d the president said. \u201cI think Lindsey would like to stay there for the next 200 years and maybe add a couple hundred thousand people every place, but I disagree with Lindsey on that.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s advisers said his defiance is fueled by his own confidence that most Republican voters are far more focused on the impeachment debate than foreign policy, and he believes many in his base share his noninterventionist instincts.\n\nChip Saltsman, a Republican strategist based in Tennessee, said that conservative activists are abuzz over the Trump-versus-House Democrats impeachment skirmish. \u201cI have talked to nobody in the grass-roots world, GOP-wise, that brought up Syria,\u201d Saltsman said. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to evangelical leaders who have. [But] to the base electorate right now, impeachment is so loud that Syria doesn\u2019t register yet.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEvangelical leaders have been outspoken about the Syria withdrawal, both because Christians there fear a Turkish takeover and out of fear that instability or a power vacuum in the region could result in Iran gaining influence and ultimately threatening Israel.\n\n\u201cEvangelicals see this decision as a punch to the gut, but punches to the gut don\u2019t always have a lasting effect,\u201d said David Brody, chief political correspondent for the Christian Broadcasting Network. He said the backlash over Syria amounts to \u201ca mini crisis\u201d for the White House, but added, \u201cThe president has done so much for evangelicals, in terms of judges and legislation, that this Syria decision isn\u2019t going to be the death knell.\u201d\n\nFormer Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee (R), who has a deep following on the religious right, tweeted, \u201cI generally support @POTUS on foreign policy & don\u2019t want our troops fighting other nations\u2019 wars, but a HUGE mistake to abandon Kurds. They\u2019ve never asked us to do THEIR fighting-just give them tools to defend themselves. They have been faithful allies. We CANNOT abandon them.\u201d\n\nStill, Trump, as well as Vice President Pence and senior adviser Jared Kushner, have so assiduously cultivated relationships with evangelical leaders that some of them have his back regardless. For example, Robert Jeffress, a Dallas evangelical pastor and televangelist, said the president sent him a \u201cdeeply appreciated handwritten letter\u201d to thank him for his supportive words on TV.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe knows we\u2019re out there supporting him and reminding people on our side that they shouldn\u2019t be surprised that the president who campaigned on ending wars wants to end wars,\u201d Jeffress said.\n\nOn impeachment, Republican lawmakers are more in line with Trump, publicly at least, than on Syria. Still, new cracks are emerging. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), a seasoned party leader regarded for his caution and keen political instincts, told the Columbus Dispatch that it is \u201cnot appropriate for a president to engage a foreign government in an investigation of a political opponent.\u201d\n\nPortman joins Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Susan Collins of Maine in expressing varying degrees of concern about Trump\u2019s conduct.\n\nAD\n\nScott Reed, chief political strategist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said Republican officials were taking things \u201cday-to-day\u201d because information continues to be revealed at a fast clip. \u201cEverybody is in a wait-and-see position,\u201d he said of members of Congress.\n\nAD\n\nPublic polling shows an increase in support for impeachment, including a Washington Post-Schar School survey released this week that measured support for opening the impeachment inquiry at 58 percent among all Americans. Three in 10 Republicans support it as well.\n\nFormer Republican congressman Charlie Dent said his friends in the House are making impeachment calculations based on base politics.\n\n\u201cI think members will stick with the president as long as the base sticks with them,\u201d Dent said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a mistake, honestly. They could actually affect opinions of the base if more of them spoke up. It\u2019s just a function of leadership.\u201d\n\nThere is an acknowledgment inside some quarters of the West Wing that Trump cannot ignore the skittishness of Republicans. Trump is working intently to rouse his political base to his side. Following discussions at the White House last month about the imperative to \u201cget Trump out into the country,\u201d as one White House official put it, the president scheduled campaign rallies for this Thursday in Minnesota and Friday in Louisiana. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the coming weeks, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney is planning to help Trump begin a quiet charm offensive with congressional Republicans, hosting private dinners and meetings, gatherings at Camp David and other ways of expressing appreciation for their support, according to three Trump advisers who were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\n\u201cThe administration looks forward to continued engagement with members about many real issues facing the American people and sadly, even the Democrats\u2019 shameful politically motivated ones like this fake impeachment,\u201d White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in an email.\n\nPence, meanwhile, traveled Wednesday to the Midwest to try to build pressure on Congress to pass the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. \u201cI came to Iowa today to turn up the heat,\u201d Pence said at an event in Waukee.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, and we all know it, Democrats have been spending all their time on endless investigations and partisan impeachment,\u201d Pence said. \u201cBut enough is enough. The American people deserve better.\u201d\n\nAt the vice president\u2019s side there was Ernst, who faces a tough reelection fight next year and recently was confronted by a constituent who was frustrated about her unwillingness to stand up against Trump.\n\nErnst was all smiles as she greeted Iowans with Pence on a farm surrounded by fields of corn, leaving no doubt that she fully embraces the Trump administration.\n\nShe later stood next to Pence before reporters and said she was \u201cglad\u201d to join him.", "description": "Many Republicans feel far safer breaking with Trump on more distant issues of foreign policy, where the president often finds himself outside of his party\u2019s historic positioning, than on matters that personally affect Trump.", "authors": ["Philip Rucker", "White House Bureau Chief", "Robert Costa", "National Political Reporter Covering The White House", "Congress"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/054-aYefdUo19cQ7eQtHcAIwvrU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OR6JZPCAJEI6TBNNO6PPAX6Z3A.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
