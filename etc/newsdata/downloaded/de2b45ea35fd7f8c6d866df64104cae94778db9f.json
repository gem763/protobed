(Nick Wass/AP)\n\nWashington Capitals forward Jakub Vrana went home to the Czech Republic in the summer feeling frustrated and with his confidence shattered. The 23-year-old had just completed his second postseason run with the Capitals, and the team\u2019s first-round playoff exit and lingering doubts of his play still danced in his mind.\n\nThe speedy, smooth-skating winger recorded zero points through seven postseason games against the Carolina Hurricanes after setting career highs in goals (24) and assists (23) in the regular season. Nearly everything was clicking for Vrana through 82 games, but the playoffs were a different animal. When reporters brought up his career year in early September, it was Vrana who cut in and joked about his poor postseason play negating his regular season.\n\nHe kept thinking about the teammates he let down, the goals he should have scored if he were just a second faster down the ice. All the scenarios raced through his head, with the \u201cwhat ifs\u201d stacking on top of each other one by one. He was prepared. He just didn\u2019t execute.\n\n\u201cI was really down on myself,\u201d Vrana said.\n\n[Caps finally get a third-period lead they can hold on to in 4-1 win over Stars]\n\nThe overthinking continued when he was home with friends and family in the Czech Republic and didn\u2019t start to diminish until he started playing in the world championships for his national team. He started to feel his confidence returning, getting back on the ice and proving the type of player he could be. In the world championship preliminary rounds Vrana had five points in seven group-stage games, including four goals.\n\nThen, he was broken down once more.\n\nIn the world championship quarterfinals, Vrana was scratched ahead of the Czech Republic\u2019s game against Germany. The scratch came after an expert for iSport.cz, Marek Sykora, said in an interview that Vrana \u201cdoesn\u2019t work enough\u201d and that he could see his \u201ccelebrity manners.\u201d It was another blow to Vrana\u2019s comeback mission.\n\n\u201cI went to the world championships where I kind of got my confidence back first couple games and then you see what happened there, it is the same thing with the playoffs,\u201d Vrana said. \u201cYou can\u2019t change it anymore.\u201d\n\nAfter the world championships, Vrana continued to train by himself, taking some time off in the offseason as he normally does to be with his friends and family. In part, that is a sliver of his coping mechanism when he has been in a bad place. To escape the rink and have fun and recharge the body is exactly what he did in mid-July, taking a vacation to Marbella, Spain. It was there he got the news via phone call that his agent had worked out a two-year, $6.7 million deal to re-sign with the Capitals.\n\nBut while taking off from hockey can be helpful, Vrana knows where he would much rather be \u2014 at a hockey rink, all by himself, with no one else around. It\u2019s usually hard to find an open sheet of ice like that in the Czech Republic, but Vrana said he is continually trying. He wants to eventually find a place like the Capitals\u2019 practice facility, where he routinely was the last player on the ice after practice last season, just working on his craft.\n\n\u201cMost of the time I\u2019m just excited to be at the hockey rink by myself,\u201d Vrana said. \u201cMaybe go work by myself, nobody there and go on the ice by myself and do my stuff. Just me and work on what I need to work on, and that brings me my confidence back. That brings me that feeling.\u201d\n\nWhen Vrana isn\u2019t by himself, he trains with his coach, Ale\u0161 Pa\u0159ez, in the Czech Republic. Pa\u0159ez, 38, is a former Czech player who trains current NHLers such as Vrana and also has ties with the Capitals. Pa\u0159ez went through an unsuccessful rookie camp with the Capitals after his college hockey career with the University of Alaska Anchorage. He then moved back to Europe and played with the Manchester Phoenix in the UK\u2019s Elite Ice Hockey League.\n\nBut Pa\u0159ez is more than just a skills coach for Vrana; he also helps with the mental side of the game. It\u2019s something Vrana believes is of the utmost important and a key part of his game: making sure his mind is in the right place to play. And for a player that always seems bubbly and happy on the outside, singing along to whatever catchy song is on in the Capitals dressing room, throwing on a backward Capitals hat and meticulously choosing the right portrait of himself for a team project, or trying to speak Slovak to Martin Fehervary that inevitably goes wrong, being able to have a serious confidant is something Vrana needs.\n\n\u201cSometimes we just sit down and talk about stuff, about real life stuff,\u201d Vrana said of Pa\u0159ez. \u201cAnd it is important to have someone to share stuff with like that, important stuff to share, someone who understands and someone who you can trust.\u201d\n\n[We asked Capitals players to draw themselves (and other things)]\n\nAnd so far, the combination of working with Pa\u0159ez, having time to step away from the game and finally return for the season has served Vrana well the first six games of the season. He has scored two goals and tallied one assist, with the first goal a game-winner in the Capitals\u2019 3-2 overtime win over the St. Louis Blues in the season opener. But he is not completely happy just yet. With a mission to prove himself year after year, he isn\u2019t here for the constant goals and points talk. Instead of setting benchmarks for himself, he believes the goals will come when he earns them through his play on the ice.\n\nBut, some trickles of last postseason have continued to rise, with Capitals Coach Todd Reirden unhappy with Vrana\u2019s play in the team\u2019s 6-5 loss to the Nashville Predators on Thursday. Reirden sent Vrana down to the fourth line for a shift or two, in hopes to spark the fire he knows Vrana has. He was playing in his normal spot on the second line Saturday in the team\u2019s 4-1 win over the Dallas Stars.\n\nAnd as Vrana looks back at his past disappointing play, he is trying to leave the past in the past \u2014 one wide-toothed grin at a time.\n\n\u201cYou know me, I am a happy guy,\u201d Vrana said. \u201cI am a happy guy. Sometimes I just get really emotional when it doesn\u2019t go my way. That is when it is really important, when things don\u2019t go well for you, you have to find a way to change it and to make them right again and that is not being frustrated and sad and all these negative stuffs. You have to find a way to be positive.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Washington Capitals:\n\nThe Capitals remain all-in on the Nationals\u2019 magical playoff run\n\nAlex Ovechkin throwing the first pitch before Game 4 deepens the Capitals-Nationals connection", "description": "Vrana has two goals and one assist through six games this season after recording zero points in the 2018-19 playoffs.", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports", "October At Pm", "Samantha Pell Covers High School Sports For The Washington Post.
