It follows long-term research which has found respiratory illness \u2013 including coughs and colds \u2013 to be the primary cause of lost training days among elite athletes.\n\nSailors plot their course to Tokyo as Team GB names its first Olympians Read more\n\n\u201cWe are working with the vast majority of Olympic and Paralympic sports on effective handwashing techniques in preparation for the Tokyo Games, which includes tools such as the SureWash training system and UV light boxes,\u201d said Craig Ranson, director of athlete health at the EIS. \u201cThis is hugely important given that respiratory and gastro-intestinal illnesses are two of the biggest health threats to athlete availability for preparation and performance.\u201d\n\nFunded by UK Sport, the EIS is based at Loughborough University, but pairs with academics from around the country in research that includes everything from biomechanics to finding the perfect amount of flex in canoeing paddles.\n\nThe Athlete Respiratory Health initiative is a partnership between the EIS and Imperial College London set up last year in response to data showing that as many as 5,800 days of training were lost to respiratory illness in the two-year period to 20 July 2017. The aim has been to treat respiratory illness as if it were any other sporting injury.\n\nDr James Hull, consultant respiratory physician at the Royal Brompton hospital and one of the initiative\u2019s lead researchers, said: \u201cWhen you look at all the athletes that travel to the Games and the problems that really scupper their chances or give them problems, nearly always top of the list are respiratory tract problems with infection at the top. So if you think about the strategies around what you might term as marginal gains, clearly you want to remove anything that might cause problems for them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s akin to thinking about injury where you might use things like special shoes to reduce impact. We want to get better at trying to detect those who are at risk of respiratory problems and then to try and reduce that risk.\u201d\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nThis includes identifying potential triggers, such as sleep deprivation and psychological stress, while also mitigating the risks brought about by tasks athletes cannot avoid, such as travelling in confined spaces and shaking the hands of any number of strangers.\n\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time thinking about how we can reduce exposure,\u201d Hull said on Tuesday on what is, in fact, global handwashing day. \u201cIt sounds relatively easy to say it but essentially most people don\u2019t know how to wash their hands properly. Given the fact that most respiratory viruses are exposed and then shared through contact, it\u2019s vitally important.\n\nShould athletes at the 2020 Olympics take political stances? | Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Read more\n\n\u201cThere is a system called SureWash which trains you electronically. You follow video and you have to go through the WHO hand-washing stages and it marks you on your ability to conduct those and it trains you. We\u2019re then able to assess the athletes to see if they are able to recall the stages and then be effective in remembering it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Hull, it is not necessarily that people do not know how to wash their hands properly, but that they quickly forget. \u201cWe\u2019ve done some work that shows people\u2019s recollection of how to wash their hands is actually very poor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWithin a two\u2011week period you can hardly remember at all how to go through the stages. The other thing is that people are fairly unaware that the alcohol gels need a contact time of a minute. If you spray it on your hand and rub it off within 15 seconds it\u2019s not really been effective.\u201d", "description": "British athletes will be taught how to wash their hands properly before Tokyo 2020, as hygiene becomes a new frontier in the hunt for marginal gains", "authors": ["Paul Macinnes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d7c1484217467c0b79055c90646a4d4a04ebf72/0_90_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b41428314e377fb1f84ed2af42b9063b", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
