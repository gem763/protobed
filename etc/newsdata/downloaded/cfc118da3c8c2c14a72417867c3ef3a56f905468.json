Forget that Biden guy.\n\n\u201cWarren\u2019s Charmed Campaign Just Entered a Brutal New Phase,\u201d warns Politico.\n\nExcept, well, it wasn\u2019t really that brutal. The disagreements at Tuesday\u2019s CNN/New York Times debate were relatively civil policy spats. No one went after her character.\n\nBIDEN DEFLECTS QUESTIONS ON SON AS CNN ANCHOR HITS TRUMP'S 'FALSE ACCUSATIONS'\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the candidates challenging Warren are also-rans, mired in the single digits. So that lessens the impact of those exchanges.\n\nTwo of them had very good nights. Amy Klobuchar, shedding her Minnesota Nice approach, repeatedly challenged Warren, the first to point out that her Medicare for All plan would boot 150 million Americans off private insurance. I don\u2019t know why the moderators don\u2019t stress that, because Warren is outplaying them in one debate after another.\n\nMarc Lacey of the Times tried three separate times to get Warren to concede what Bernie Sanders already has, that middle-class taxes would rise under her plan. And three times Warren deflected the question by saying the rich and big corporations would pay more for health care and the middle class would pay less, evading the tax question entirely.\n\nIt took Pete Buttigieg to call out Warren for failing to answer a simple yes-or-no question. He had perhaps his best debate of the campaign, making an eloquent pitch for moderate ideas. And his strongest moment came in an exchange on Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s gun buyback program, when he said: \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.\u201d Buttigieg, of course, is an Afghanistan war veteran.\n\nOn the other hand, he only whacked Beto, who\u2019s going nowhere fast.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nPolitico\u2019s lead story says: \u201cThe candidate who brags about having a plan for everything was pilloried for not detailing how she would pay for her most expensive proposal. She was accused \u2014 sometimes subtly, sometimes explicitly \u2014 of being naive, dishonest, not adequately respecting her colleagues\u2019 ideas, tearing people down, and failing to enact major legislation. She was attacked for believing in policies that were \u201cpunitive\u201d and a theory of governing that was a \u2018pipe dream.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe debate just wasn\u2019t as rough as that lead made it sound. After all, they ended by talking about Ellen.\n\nThe Washington Post declared Warren one of its winners:\n\n\u201cFor the first time in one of these debates, Warren found herself under sustained attack. Through a combination of debate format, Joe Biden\u2019s leads in early polls and Warren\u2019s unique political Teflon, she had somehow avoided it. That changed Tuesday, though. Warren was the focal point, with the other candidates all but taking their focus thoroughly off Biden. It wasn\u2019t completely smooth sailing for Warren\u2026but it was an affirmation that she is viewed as perhaps the front-runner now.\u201d\n\nLook, the reason Warren has had such a smooth ride\u2014besides running a very good, issues-based campaign\u2014is that the press pretty much loves her. I\u2019ve lost track of the number of puffy profiles about how she found her voice in Oklahoma, at Harvard, as a bankruptcy lawyer, at the consumer protection agency. She is getting one-hundredth of the media scrutiny that\u2019s been aimed at Biden, who is not a press favorite.\n\nWhen that changes, you\u2019ll know she\u2019s the front-runner.\n\nAs for Biden, he had some strong moments, especially on Syria, but his answers about his son were weak\u2014especially since Hunter Biden confessed to poor judgment on ABC that morning even as his dad was touting his judgment that night. Biden caught a break when Anderson Cooper followed up only once and none of the other Democrats wanted to go there.\n\nThe media consensus is that Biden had another uneven night, and he does have a tendency to trip over his words. And yet, despite poor debate reviews and having to play defense on Ukraine, he keeps holding onto his supporters.\n\nThe bottom line is that the impeachment drama will quickly drown out this debate, whose 8.3 million viewers represent another decline. There won\u2019t be days of stories about Klobuchar or Buttigieg that might ordinarily give them a chance to break through. If either is to have a shot at becoming Warren\u2019s main moderate rival, the Biden campaign will essentially have to collapse.\n\nFootnote: As if to underscore my point, the dustup between Trump and Democratic leaders--with the president calling the speaker a \"third-rate politician\"--bumped the Ohio debate way down on many cable news shows.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren, according to the pundits, should be thrilled because she got beat up at the Ohio debate.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/16/694940094001_6095369135001_6095369509001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
