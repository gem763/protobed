The third-quarter profit was equivalent to 0.20 pesos a share or $0.20 for an American depositary receipt.\n\nForeign-exchange losses, related particularly to the depreciation of the Colombian and Argentine currencies against the U.S. dollar, contributed to higher financial costs than in the third quarter of 2018.\n\nRevenue edged up 0.2% from the third quarter of 2018 to 248.4 billion pesos, with service revenue in local currency terms up 2.5%, including a 4.6% increase in wireless revenue.\n\nThe company added 800,000 wireless subscribers in the quarter for a total of 278.7 million, little changed from a year earlier, while subscriptions to fixed-line services -- phone, television and broadband internet -- fell by 229,000 in the quarter to 84.3 million.\n\nOperating profit increased 7.3% to 38.1 billion pesos, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, rose 9.5% to 78.8 billion pesos, helped in part by changes in accounting rules.\n\nAm\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil operates in a number of economies that have recorded slow growth this year, including Mexico where gross domestic product contracted in the first quarter and was flat in the second.\n\nAfter the second quarter, company executives shrugged off concerns about the impact of the economic slowdown on telecommunications. \"The telecom sector is a very defensive sector,\" chief executive Daniel Hajj said in July.\n\nThe company's third-quarter revenue in Mexico rose 2.9%, with service revenue up 4.1%, including an 8.2% rise in wireless service revenue. In Brazil, revenue increased 2% from a year earlier, with service revenue up 2.2%.\n\nWrite to Anthony Harrup at anthony.harrup@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 15, 2019 19:34 ET (23:34 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
