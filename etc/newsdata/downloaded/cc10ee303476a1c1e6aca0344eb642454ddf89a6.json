(Getty)\n\nWhen the NFL made pass interference calls subject to review, many bemoaned the change, anticipating increased controversy with a rule intended to reduce it.\n\nThis is the reason why.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nGreen Bay Packers head coach Matt LaFleur challenged a play that wasn\u2019t flagged on the field in the third quarter Thursday against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nHow was this not flagged?\n\nAaron Rodgers had targeted Marquez Valdes-Scantling on a sideline route on third-and seven on Green Bay\u2019s opening drive of the half.\n\nEagles cornerback Avonte Maddox was covering on the play. Before the ball arrived, he jumped into Valdes-Scantling\u2019s body face first and shoved his left hand into his chin. He didn\u2019t make a play on the ball.\n\nI mean, this can't be anything other than DPI pic.twitter.com/ssTViKFOOt \u2014 Gordon McGuinness (@PFF_Gordon) September 27, 2019\n\nThere was no flag on the play. Fourth down.\n\nRuling upheld on review\n\nLaFleur hesitated for a moment before throwing his red challenge flag to review the play for pass interference.\n\nOfficials looked at film of the play above and upheld the ruling on the field that there was, indeed, no pass interference.\n\nThe official explanation from NFL officials stated \u201cthere was no clear and obvious evidence\u201d of interference.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIn #PHIvsGB, Green Bay challenged for pass interference. After review, there was no clear and obvious evidence that Philadelphia #29 significantly hindered the opponent.\u201d - AL pic.twitter.com/Loc0LJp90q \u2014 NFL Officiating (@NFLOfficiating) September 27, 2019\n\nControversy over call\n\nThe announcement arrived to a cascade of jeers at Lambeau Field and questions on social media and on the Fox broadcast about what exactly constitutes pass interference.\n\nIf this non-call didn\u2019t warrant being overturned, then what exactly does?\n\nIt\u2019s a sentiment shared by Fox\u2019s rules analyst Mike Pereira.\n\n\u201cIt has to be clear and obvious,\u201d Pereira said on the broadcast. \u201cTo me, I think it was. You have a defender not playing the ball and in slow motion I think he significantly hinders his ability to make the catch. To me that qualifies in the defensive pass interference under this replay rule, and I would have liked to see that overturned.\u201d\n\nIt was a pivotal play in the game. Instead of gaining a first down past midfield, the Packers punted. The Eagles score a touchdown eight plays later and extended their lead to 27-20.\n\nAnother PI challenge\n\nLater in the quarter, Eagles head coach Doug Pederson challenged a no call when Packers cornerback Kevin King hit Alshon Jefferey\u2019s arm before a pass from Carson Wentz arrived.\n\nAs in the first play, it looked like a clear case of pass interference. As in the first review, the call on the field was upheld.\n\nAs long as this rule exists, so too will controversies like Thursday\u2019s.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "How did officials deem there was no pass interference on this play?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xaPz8sEXK6gXLkUEzm9aRQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/V7dQz1Eil7.E7LRRzbNKLg--~B/aD0zNTg4O3c9NTM4MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/21f01680-e0d1-11e9-afe6-19ed6ef6a12e", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
