(AP) - Carolina Panthers fans voiced their displeasure more than once with boos during a 20-14 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Thursday night.\n\nPerhaps being soaked by an early evening thunderstorm that delayed game action in the first quarter for 25 minutes led to their ill mood. But those who remained at Bank of America Stadium throughout had to be wondering how a Panthers season that started with high expectations is now teetering on the brink of disaster after an 0-2 start.\n\nThat became certain after Christian McCaffrey\u2019s fourth-and-one fake reverse was stopped for no gain with 1:22 to play.\n\n\u201cIt came down to the ball is in my hands and I\u2019ve got to make a play at the end of the game, and I didn\u2019t,\u201d McCaffrey said.\n\nIt marked the third time Carolina was unable to convert a fourth-and-one play. Quarterback Cam Newton was stopped in the first quarter, and a pass by Newton was incomplete earlier in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Panthers were just 3 of 14 on third downs, too.\n\nOh, and they failed to score a touchdown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely frustrating knowing that you\u2019re getting opportunities and you\u2019re not putting the ball in the end zone,\u201d Newton said\n\nCarolina\u2019s loss came on a night in which the Panthers were afforded numerous opportunities to even their record following a 30-27 home loss five days earlier against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nTampa Bay had a missed touchdown catch on a drive that resulted in a missed field goal late in the third quarter, and the Buccaneers committed 12 penalties.\n\nBut the Panthers\u2018 offense misfired time and again on a night in which Carolina\u2019s points came on four field goals and a safety by Luke Kuechly.\n\n\u201cThrough my lens, it\u2019s hard to look defensive guys in the eyes after a game like this,\u201d Newton said. \u201cOffensively, we\u2019ve got to hold up our end of the bargain. We just didn\u2019t uphold our end. And we\u2019re past due.\u201d\n\nNewton, who had offseason shoulder surgery, was questioned earlier in the week about his team\u2019s lack of deep throws.\n\nHe appeared to answer those critics with a 44-yard completion to Curtis Samuel late in the first quarter. But offensive line breakdowns led to pressure on six throws and Newton was sacked three times. He completed 25 of 51 passes for 333 yards.\n\nAdditionally, Newton\u2019s usually effective running game was again non-existent.\n\nThe third all-time rushing quarterback in NFL history, Newton followed his career-low minus-two yards in Sunday\u2019s loss with a second-worst game of two carries for zero yards. For the season, Newton now has five carries for minus-two yards with two fumbles.\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s very frustrating,\u201d Panthers coach Ron Rivera said. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating when so many things go against us. And at the end of the day, that\u2019s on me. We\u2019ve got a couple extra days to watch some things on tape. We\u2019ll get those things worked out and those things corrected. We\u2019ve got 15 weeks and we\u2019ll take them one at a time.\u201d\n\nMcCaffrey followed last Sunday\u2019s 209 total yards on 29 touches with 53 yards on 18 touches.\n\nWere McCaffrey\u2019s struggles a result of Newton\u2019s inability to establish a running game that has churned for 4,808 yards in his first eight NFL seasons?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d McCaffrey said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see.\u201d\n\nThe loss gives Carolina its ninth 0-2 start in the franchise\u2019s 25-year history - and first since 2013.\n\nIn 2013, the Panthers started 0-2 and 1-3 before an eight-game winning streak led to a 12-4 record. It marks the only time Carolina has recovered from an 0-2 start to have a winning record.\n\nEven worse for the Panthers, Thursday\u2019s loss marks the ninth time Carolina has started a season with two straight home losses. And the best the Panthers have ever done after losing their first two home games was 7-9 (in 1997, 2000, 2004 and 2007).\n\nThe home loss was the team\u2019s fifth straight. That is tied for fourth-longest in franchise history.\n\nNewton said he heard - and understood - the fans\u2019 frustration in the form of boos.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d Newton said. \u201cI hear the fans. Walking off the field, I can\u2019t deny the fact that I hear that. You can\u2019t blame them. They deserve better.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Carolina Panthers fans voiced their displeasure more than once with boos during a 20-14 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Thursday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Richard Walker"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/buccaneers_panthers_football_29777_c0-122-2919-1823_s1770x1032.jpg?7656fcaf11e7b09d69092a4863110d6cad41c636", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
