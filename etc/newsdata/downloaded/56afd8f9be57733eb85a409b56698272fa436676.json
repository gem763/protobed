Radioactive material was then blasted skyward, as the reactor shattered and ignited into an inferno.\n\nThe explosion released 100 times more radiation than the atomic bombs dropped on Japan, and experts say between 4,000 and 27,000 people died as a result (estimates vary due to lost reports when the Soviet Union broke up).\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n(Image: Mediadrumimages/RobynVonSwank)\n\nJust over 33 years on, Robyn ventured into the barren lands and found residents wearing stoney-faced expressions, continuing with their lives unfazed and tending to their modest wooden houses.\n\nShe visited some locals - mostly aged over 80 - and was invited into their homes and fed various Ukrainian cuisine.\n\n\"The people were warm and welcoming and spoke openly about their histories,\" she said, according to the Mail Online . \"Some sobbed when speaking of the incident, having been affected so personally.\"\n\n(Image: Mediadrumimages/RobynVonSwank)\n\n(Image: Mediadrumimages/RobynVonSwank)\n\nDespite the warnings, many families are still relocating to the area - particularly amid ongoing conflicts currently raging between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nOne of the residents, Maria, survived the Nazi invasion, the Chernobyl disaster and Soviet rule, and vowed to never leave her home.\n\n(Image: Mediadrumimages/RobynVonSwank)\n\n(Image: Mediadrumimages/RobynVonSwank)\n\nRobyn's remarkable snaps show the elderly residents in humble wooden homes, wrapped in several layers to protect against the harsh snowy conditions. Inside are mostly just life's essentials: furniture, clothes, pots, pans and food.\n\nFollowing the 1986 blast, the blaze spewed radiation for 10 days - with after effects being felt as far afield as Greece and the UK - while radioactive clouds moved across Europe as poisonous rain wreaked havoc on plants and animals in Belarus.\n\n(Image: Mediadrumimages/RobynVonSwank)\n\n(Image: Mediadrumimages/RobynVonSwank)\n\n(Image: Mediadrumimages/RobynVonSwank)\n\nNumerous creatures were later found with genetic mutations - including some with extra limbs, and barn swallows with deformed beaks and smaller brains.\n\n(Image: Mediadrumimages/RobynVonSwank)\n\n(Image: Mediadrumimages/RobynVonSwank)\n\nThe highest density wolf population worldwide now lives in the Exclusion Area, so it made sense that while exploring an abandoned town, Robyn noticed footprints behind her - which emerged to belong to a pack of pursuing wolves.\n\n\"Thankfully, the predators have a bounty of prey to eat already,\" she explained, \"because the zone continues to grow as a biodiverse forest where animals don't worry about being killed by humans anymore.\"", "description": "Some residents ignored radiation warnings and are currently braving the Exclusion Zone's harsh conditions", "authors": ["Chris Flanagan", "Image", "Mediadrumimages Robynvonswank"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20641745.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Radioactive-Residents.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
