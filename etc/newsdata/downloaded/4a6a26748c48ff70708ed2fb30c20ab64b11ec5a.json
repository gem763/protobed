But there is nothing quite like seeing Jane Campion stand beside Greta Gerwig - two of the five female directing nominees in Oscars history - and count, by 10s, the number of men who have been nominated for best director. She got up to 350.\n\nThe film academy\u2019s president, David Rubin, said there is no agenda when the 54-member board of governors selects the honorary Oscar recipients, but this year seemed to correct a few wrongs and could even signal a more promising future.\n\nJean Hersholt Humanitarian Award recipient Geena Davis asked everyone in the room to not make another movie without doing a \u201cgender and diversity pass\u201d on the script first.\n\nWhile toasting Studi, his \u201cThe New World\u201d and \u201cHostiles\u201d co-star, Christian Bale noted native and indigenous people have been underrepresented on both sides of the camera but \u201cwe\u2019re in a room full of people who can change that.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Governors Awards crowd is a powerful one, featuring A-list stars, directors, producers and executives populating nearly every table: Leonardo DiCaprio, Quentin Tarantino, Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos, Sony Pictures Chairman Tom Rothman, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Amy Pascal were just a few of the power players in the audience.\n\nThe event has become an informal and low-pressure stop for awards hopefuls, and this year was no different, with various cast members and filmmakers behind \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood,\u201d \u201dLittle Women,\u201d \u201dBooksmart,\u201d \u201dDolemite Is My Name,\u201d \u201dJoker,\u201d \u201dMarriage Story,\u201d \u201dHustlers,\u201d \u201dRocketman,\u201d \u201dPain and Glory\u201d and \u201cA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\u201d in attendance.\n\nEven Jamie Foxx, who kicked off the evening, noted the number of big movie stars in this year\u2019s highest-profile films, calling on Tom Hanks and DiCaprio to stand up and make their presence known. Hanks did a little dance, while DiCaprio stood and gave a wave to the room. He even made Eddie Murphy come all the way up to the stage only to admit that he didn\u2019t have anything planned beyond that. Foxx just wanted to congratulate him on \u201cDolemite.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you really enjoy cinema this year is a special year,\u201d Foxx said. \u201cNothing against the newcomers \u2026 but when you see your heroes giving such great work it just feels great.\u201d\n\nAnd indeed, many chose to greet their fellow creatives instead of sitting and eating dinner before the presentations began. Gerwig could be seen speaking with Pedro Almod\u00f3var, while \u201cRocketman\u201d director Dexter Fletcher said hello to Robert Pattinson and Saoirse Ronan embraced her \u201cLittle Women\u201d mother Laura Dern.\n\nBut all eyes turned attentively to the stage for the main event, where standing ovations were common and, in the case of Lynch, sometimes even longer than the speeches.\n\nDern, Isabella Rossellini and Kyle MacLachlan all delivered heartfelt remarks about their beloved director, who MacLachlan said exhibits the same amount of excitement in making a perfect sandwich as dreaming up a new film.\n\nBut the 73-year-old \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d and \u201cMulholland Drive\u201d director kept his remarks brief, thanking the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the honor, \u201cAnd to all the people who helped me along the road.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a very interesting face,\u201d Lynch said, before closing with a simple: \u201cGood night.\u201d\n\nHis fellow honorees took a bit more time with their Oscars. Studi, for one, wasn\u2019t about to cut his historic moment short.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d the 71-year-old actor said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be here tonight as the first native, indigenous American to receive an Academy Award.\u201d\n\nDiCaprio stood twice to applaud Studi, taking out his phone to film the actor proudly holding his Oscar.\n\nThere have been only a handful of indigenous people nominated for Oscars. In 1982, Cree musician Buffy Sainte-Marie, who was born in Canada, won an Oscar for co-writing the music to best song winner \u201cUp Where We Belong.\u201d\n\nQ\u2019orianka Kilcher, who acted with Studi in \u201cThe New World,\u201d said he \u201crevolutionized how indigenous peoples are portrayed in cinema, showing us all what is possible.\u201d\n\nWertm\u00fcller, another trailblazer in film for being the first woman to ever be nominated for best director for \u201cSeven Beauties\u201d in 1977, was praised by the likes of Tarantino and Scorsese, as well as three of her fellow female directing nominees including Campion, Gerwig and Sofia Coppola.\n\n\u201cI ate her films,\u201d Gerwig said of Wertm\u00fcller. \u201cHer films turned me into an addict.\u201d\n\nJodie Foster, in a video tribute, said she didn\u2019t even realize women could be directors before she learned about Wertm\u00fcller.\n\nThe petite 91-year-old filmmaker barely cleared the microphone as she stood on stage to accept the Oscar, which she tapped on the head and said, through Rossellini who was translating, that she wanted to rename Anna.\n\n\u201cNext time, please, not only the Oscar, but a female Oscar,\u201d Wertm\u00fcller said. \u201cWomen in the room please scream, \u2018We want Anna the female Oscar.\u2019\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ldbahr\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Inequality in the film industry got a high-profile spotlight at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' 11th annual Governors Awards, where Cherokee actor Wes Studi, Italian director Lina Wertm\u00fcller and filmmaker David Lynch all received honorary Oscars on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Lindsey Bahr"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/28/2019_governors_awards_-_show_96721_c0-212-3000-1962_s1200x700.jpg?22feaa3f104a538cd9fcf346ed78da27341557fd", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
