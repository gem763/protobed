Excuses!\u201d Trump tweeted Friday.\n\nHe elaborated on this critique during a subsequent interview with reporters.\n\n\u201cA lot of badly run companies are trying to blame tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other words, if they\u2019re running badly and they\u2019re having a bad quarter, or if they\u2019re just unlucky in some way, they\u2019re trying to blame the tariffs. It\u2019s not the tariffs. It\u2019s called \u2018bad management.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOn the one hand, Trump is a pretty credible source here: He does know a lot about bad management and excuses. So maybe we should believe him when he scapegoats corporations for not being able to manage the costs of his trade wars. In the president\u2019s thinking, if a company can\u2019t hack it when faced with a sudden, unexpected, government-imposed cost or other erratic policy changes, it simply doesn\u2019t deserve to stay in business.\n\nOn the other hand, this is an extremely odd interpretation of recent business complaints, given the rest of Trump\u2019s economic agenda.\n\nAfter all, besides tax cuts, the main way that Trump has supposedly unlocked the economy\u2019s great potential and put us on the path to 3 (or 4, or even 6!) percent growth is by reducing the government-imposed cost of doing business and providing more regulatory certainty.\n\nThat\u2019s the standard Trump talking point, anyway. According to the president, his pro-business, regulation-slashing rampage has enriched the average American family by $3,000 \u2014 an eye-popping number of dubious provenance, awarded three Pinocchios by The Post\u2019s fact-checker extraordinaire Glenn Kessler.\n\nTrump and his various allies and surrogates likewise often repeat the boilerplate claim that the president\u2019s \u201ctax cuts and deregulation\u201d agenda has supposedly already unleashed higher gross-domestic-product growth. That\u2019s despite the fact that major independent forecasters believe 2019 GDP growth is on track for about 2.2 percent, which is . . . exactly what it averaged during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term.\n\nTrump surrogates often outright lie about what his tax cuts did and whom they targeted. On the deregulation point, though, they typically avoid any specifics altogether. And they\u2019re rarely asked follow-up questions about which onerous, job-killing government regulations they\u2019re thinking of when they brag about how Trump has so wisely rolled them back.\n\nWhich is lucky for them. Because if you actually look over Trump\u2019s regulatory rollbacks, it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint which, if any, of them is supposedly unleashing all that (imaginary) growth.\n\nPerhaps the economy-growing deregulations that Team Trump is thinking of are his dozens of environmental rule changes. These do indeed help a handful of companies save money \u2014 by, for instance, allowing them to dump more mercury and arsenic into the water supply, pump more methane and fine particulate matter into the air, and use a pesticide linked to neurological damage in children.\n\nPresumably taking those options off the table could raise the cost of doing business, at least a little.\n\nOr maybe Trumpkins are instead thinking of the rescission of a requirement for for-profit schools to disclose (and maintain minimum) employment outcomes as a condition of continuing to receive federal aid.\n\nOr maybe they mean Trump\u2019s repeal of a rule that said companies could only get lucrative government contracts upon certifying that they follow federal labor laws.\n\nOr maybe it\u2019s the relaxation of yet another rule dictating how many hours long-haul truck drivers can go without sleeping.\n\nIn each of these cases (and others), rolling back regulations might reduce costs and thereby boost profits for companies. But that doesn\u2019t actually eliminate said costs. It just shifts them onto someone else \u2014 such as whoever lives downwind from the coal plant or happens to share the road with a sleep-deprived trucker.\n\nIn other words, those government-imposed, \u201cjob-killing\u201d costs were there to address what economists call externalities: costs imposed upon third parties. Unlike, say, Trump\u2019s pointless but still costly trade wars, they were designed to correct a market failure, not to make a functional market fail.\n\nSo maybe Trump\u2019s comment about the interaction between burdensome government policies and \u201cbad management\u201d \u2014 that if you can\u2019t handle a little extra government-imposed cost, you probably aren\u2019t running a great business \u2014 was right, after all. He was just applying it to the wrong government policies. Listen to Trump\u2019s insight, ye whiny, excuse-making businesses: If your company can stay afloat if and only if it dumps arsenic in the water, defrauds customers, cheats workers or gives kids brain damage, maybe you don\u2019t deserve to be in business after all.", "description": "The president has had some experience with poorly run companies and excuse-making.", "authors": ["Catherine Rampell", "Columnist Covering Economics", "Public Policy", "Politics", "September At Pm", "Catherine Rampell Is An Opinion Columnist At The Washington Post.
