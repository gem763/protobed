Watching the news coverage, he exclaimed, \u201cWhat were we doing, training in the woods, when we should have been overseas helping to win the Cold War?\u201d\n\nConstruction of the Berlin Wall began at the height of the Cold War in 1961. The wall was a physical and ideological divide between East and West, its role immortalized in John le Carre\u2019s 1963 best-seller, \u201cThe Spy Who Came In from the Cold.\u201d\n\nThe Berlin Wall, a Soviet effort to prevent its own citizens from witnessing the basic freedoms they were denied, was what Churchill presciently warned about in his Iron Curtain speech more than 15 years earlier.\n\nDuring his 1987 speech at the Brandenburg Gate, President Reagan eloquently issued a clarion call for freedom, declaring that \u201cthe advance of human liberty can only strengthen the cause of world peace.\u201d\n\nReagan then famously declared: \u201cGeneral Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity, if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\u201d\n\nAt our training exercise two years later, my colleagues and I watched with mounting excitement and admiration as crowds of East Germans climbed over the wall and joined West Germans in celebration.\n\nThe Brandenburg Gate was opened just 21/2 years after Reagan\u2019s powerful speech. The Wall, once almost 90 miles long, was fully demolished by 1992.\n\nThe West did not bring down the Berlin Wall kinetically. The ideas of liberty, freedom, and democracy exposed the hypocrisy of the corrupt Soviet regime and its satellites, which trampled on human rights at home and abroad. Soft power, not hard steel, tore down the wall.\n\nAlmost 30 years later, people from Beijing to Moscow, from Tehran to Pyongyang, are still denied basic human rights. The Berlin Wall has been gone longer than it stood. But is it really gone?\n\nKGB operative-in-the-Kremlin Vladimir Putin once called the collapse of the Soviet Union the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century. Mr. Putin once served in East Germany and understands that democracy is an existential threat to dictatorships. Mr. Putin knows he cannot build a new Berlin Wall, but one of his first steps upon becoming president was to take control of Russian television media so that he could control the news and its interpretation.\n\nChina is trying to create a Soviet Big Brother-style \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d to deny its own citizens freedom of expression and access to the truth.\n\nDemocracy protests in Hong Kong have been ongoing since March. On August 23, over 200,000 city residents formed a human chain over 30 miles long to demand their rights.\n\nHong Kongers chose that date with a keen sense of history. August 23 is the anniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the infamous 1939 neutrality treaty which secretly divided Poland, the Baltic nations and Romania between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1983, President Reagan famously called the Soviet Union an \u201cevil empire.\u201d News of his speech spread behind the Iron Curtain and demonstrated U.S. resolve to Soviet citizens who derived inspiration from the U.S. as a beacon of democracy.\n\nAs we remember the legacy of the Berlin Wall, we should renew our commitment to standing in solidarity with those who are denied the freedoms we enjoy. President Kennedy famously stood with Berliners in June 1963 when he proclaimed himself and all other free men, wherever they may live, citizens of Berlin.\n\nToday, we are all Hong Kongers.\n\n\u2022 Daniel N.
