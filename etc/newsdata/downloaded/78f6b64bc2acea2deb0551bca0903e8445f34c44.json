This year, though, residents of the Basque provincial capital have also had to put up with our city being turned into the latest Woody Allen film set. The movie, Rifkin\u2019s Festival, is about a couple who fall in love while in town for the San Sebasti\u00e1n film festival, drawing on the annual event (this year\u2019s begins on 20 September) as the backdrop to a romantic comedy.\n\nAt a time when Allen is being shunned by many people in film, the veteran director has seemingly found a reliable ally in his Spanish partner Mediapro. The company ishandling the co-production and distribution of Rifkin\u2019s Festival, just as it did with Allen\u2019s previous movie endeavours Midnight in Paris and Vicky Cristina Barcelona, among others. Whatever the legitimacy of the #MeToo movement\u2019s calls for an Allen artistic boycott, the impact his film could have on the urban fabric of the city is currently of greater concern to many of us in San Sebasti\u00e1n, a city which has been undergoing a metamorphosis since hosting the European capital of culture in 2016.\n\nAllen\u2019s relationship with the city goes back to 2004 when he premiered Melinda & Melinda at the city\u2019s film festival. Allen was back in 2008 for the screening of Vicky Cristina Barcelona, which then became an inspiration for local and regional powers keen to promote the city and region.\n\nSo delighted was the council about Rifkin\u2019s Festival that it threw an official reception at city hall to welcome the director on the eve of shooting. At a press conference beforehand Allen was enthusiastic about gracing the city, saying: \u201cI\u2019d like to convey to the world my view of San Sebasti\u00e1n the way I conveyed my view of Paris or New York to people.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018So delighted was the city council about Rifkin\u2019s Festival that it threw an official reception at city hall to welcome the director on the eve of shooting.\u2019 Woody Allen at a press conference in San Sebasti\u00e1n in July.

The film \u2013 at least as far as the city fathers are concerned \u2013 isn\u2019t just a touch of Hollywood glamour, it is a perfect means to get the city more deeply embedded on the global tourist map. Allen\u2019s film represents a two-hour advertising slot to spur the arrival of further visitors and investors. My fear is that this film will show an image of San Sebasti\u00e1n via a series of cliches that are easily recognisable by a global audience, but which are completely detached from the local reality.\n\nThe movie aligns with a branding strategy that seeks to turn San Sebasti\u00e1n into an attractive location for large-scale film and audiovisual projects. The Spanish public deserve more transparency than they are currently getting about the tax burden this implies. At the very least it looks sensible to ask for more information about the role of public funding in such vast productions.\n\nMy concern is about something else too, though: how the film is being used as a narrative weapon to promote San Sebasti\u00e1n\u2019s enviable landscape, vibrant atmosphere and outstanding gastronomy, all of which will lure other big international events \u2013 film, jazz, food etc \u2013 which in turn keep fuelling the tourism juggernaut.\n\nTourism already musters the biggest share of local GDP and the tourist monoculture is prioritised under the guise of creating jobs and wealth; the red carpet rolled out to welcome any business connected to it. Yet, as the philosopher Marina Garc\u00e9s points out, tourism is an extractive industry, commodifying common resources \u2013 neighbourhoods, squares and streets \u2013 and turning them into assets for private exploitation, while often dispossessing the people who give these spaces meaning by living in them. Entire neighbourhoods gentrify in order to host either the tourists or wealthier inhabitants.\n\nFar from generating the expected prosperity, tourism may actually intensify what we call socio-spatial injustice. The marketing strategy being implemented in San Sebasti\u00e1n risks creating a vicious cycle of overtourism and downturn. The more it does to boost tourist numbers, the more overtourism threatens the authenticity of the space and thus downgrades the tourist experience. If the influx continues growing at the current pace, San Sebasti\u00e1n will be doomed to join a long list of destinations that are victims of their own success, such as Venice or Barcelona.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The old town is the epicentre of tourist activity in San Sebasti\u00e1n, so anyone who lives near it is basically living in a theme park.\u2019 People outside a bar in San Sebasti\u00e1n.

Ordinary shops are being replaced by handicrafts and souvenir stores, fancy bars and the like. The old town is the epicentre of tourist activity in San Sebasti\u00e1n, so anyone who lives near it is basically living in a theme park with the all the crowds, pollution and noise that brings.\n\nHow tourism is killing Barcelona \u2013 a photo essay Read more\n\nProtests against mass tourism first erupted during the summer of 2017 and the movement keeps growing. These spontaneous demonstrations by people claiming the right to inhabit the city have helped broaden social awareness of the issue. This has in turn spurred the authorities to take action, with, for example, a tourist tax proposal, implicitly accepting that overtourism is a real problem for the city.\n\nBut San Sebasti\u00e1n is far from being an isolated case in risking economic depletion from mass tourism. Along with Venice, Barcelona, Lisbon, Palma de Mallorca and many other southern European cities, San Sebasti\u00e1n is now part of a network fighting for a more sustainable model of tourism and ultimately working for a perhaps surprising common goal: the opposite of growth.\n\n\u2022 Mikel Agirre-Maskariano is a geographer and member of Bizilagunekin, which advocates for an alternative approach to tourism", "description": "San Sebasti\u00e1n is already under strain from overtourism.
