Mitt Romney, who has recently said he may decline to support President Trump\u2019s reelection bid, tweeted on Sunday that it would be \u2018troubling in the extreme\u2019 if the president appealed to his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nRomney, in a tweet on Sunday, said it was \"critical for the facts to come out.\u201d\n\nTrump called his conversations with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u201cperfectly fine and routine.\"\n\n\u201cNothing was said that was in any way wrong,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump has been reportedly accused of pressuring Zelenskiy to work with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, in investigating Hunter Biden, and using military aid as leverage.\n\nTrump denied making any improper requests, but he did point fingers at the Bidens and their relationship with Ukraine.\n\nThe Democratic presidential hopeful\u2019s son Hunter Biden had been investigated related to business interests.\n\nBiden has said in the past that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired, but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to Hunter Biden\u2019s case, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.\n\nBiden told reporters in Iowa on Saturday that \u201cTrump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him the question, why is he on the phone with a foreign leader trying to intimidate a foreign leader, if that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe accused Trump of \u201cdoing this because he knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum and he\u2019s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me.\u201d\n\nTrump accused Biden of dishonesty in claiming that he never spoke to his son about his business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company, despite Hunter Biden telling the New Yorker that they spoke \u201cjust once\u201d about it.\n\nFox News' Edmund DeMarche, Ronn Blitzer, Nick Givas and the Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "Utah Sen.
