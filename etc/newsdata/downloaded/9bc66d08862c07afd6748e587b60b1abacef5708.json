After posing nude for the cover of Women's Health Naked Strength issue, the America's Got Talent judge has foregone clothes more than a few times. (Hello, Julianne walked around naked for a week after the shoot!)\n\nOne of those nude days is today, since Julianne shared a totally topless photo to Instagram ahead of the AGT finale. She captioned the post: \"So does this constitute a #thirsttrap? \ud83d\ude1d\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u2640\ufe0f #AGTFinale starts tonight! @agt.\" In the artsy black-and-white shot, an upside down Julianne covers herself just enough so she doesn't #freethenipple. Her strong back and arms are visible and seriously so toned.\n\nBaring it all for Julianne isn't about flashing her flat abs, though. \"It's more about what this journey was for me this year about shedding and coming back to the core and essence of who I am and how I got there,\" she previously told Women's Health.\n\n\"I wanted to be vulnerable and show the strength and what it means to be raw and exposed. There's nothing to be ashamed of or to hide when it comes to your growth. That's the purpose of why I wanted to do this shoot. I get emotional thinking about it.\"\n\nAfter stripping down, she realized: \"This is the greatest thing in life.\" Also great is Julianne's super fit bod, which she works hard to maintain.\n\nThe Dancing With The Stars vet and America's Got Talent judge definitely makes eating well and staying active a priority: She says she exercises five days a week in the mornings\u2014even though she's not a morning person.\n\nWhat do Julianne's morning workouts consist of? Turns out, she's really into group fitness classes, staying fit with SoulCycle and CorePower Yoga.\"I love being around people and community,\" she explains. She also strength trains regularly, often with her husband, hockey player Brooks Laich.\n\nGet it, girl!\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "\"So does this constitute a thirsttrap? \ud83d\ude1d\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u2640\ufe0f\"", "authors": ["Jennifer Nied"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FPe7H6lym90YyHoYZxt0xg--~B/aD0xMDAyO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_womens_health_52/918a44d8dcd7083f6f186153a0eed587", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
