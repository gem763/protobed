(AP) - If everything had gone according to plan, Patty Tavatanakit would be in North Carolina this week preparing for two weeks of the LPGA Q-Series in her bid to earn status on the LPGA Tour.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work out that way. It went much better.\n\nThat\u2019s why the 20-year-old Thai from UCLA is chasing her other hobby in New York. A foodie at heart, Tavatanakit has an Instagram account she calls \u201ceatunderpar\u201d and already has posts from Joe\u2019s Pizza, Liberty Bagels and The Big Szechuan Cuisine.\n\nShe had reason to celebrate.\n\nTavatanakit is two weeks removed from securing her LPGA Tour card with alarming ease, and she might have been on the LPGA Tour even sooner if not for a recent change in regulations. She was the only three-time winner on the Symetra Tour, a feat that used to come with an instant promotion. It went away with the creation of the Q-Series, consecutive 72-hole events at Pinehurst that determines who gets cards.\n\nThat\u2019s where Tavatanakit hoped to be when she turned pro in June after the NCAA championship. The late start gave her about three months to try to finish in the top 35 on the Symetra Tour money list and qualify for the Q-Series. That was her goal.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a good sophomore season, so I didn\u2019t have a high vision of myself shooting all these numbers,\u201d Tavatanakit said. \u201cBut you know how things happen when you least expect it? That\u2019s probably why this all happened.\u201d\n\nWhat happened was a blazing debut.\n\nAfter a tie for 34th in the U.S. Women\u2019s Open in her pro debut, and a tie for 14th in her first start on the Symetra Tour, she finished second and then won her next two tournaments. She won her third tournament in her eighth start, coming from six shots back with a birdie-birdie finish for a 62 and winning a playoff.\n\nTavatanakit was rookie of the year, finished No. 2 on the money list in 11 starts and earned an LPGA card to avoid another trip to Q-Series.\n\nAt least this time, she would have wanted to be there.\n\nA year ago, Tavatanakit was among 11 top amateurs invited to Q-Series. She was coming off a summer in which she tied for fifth in the U.S. Women\u2019s Open at Shoal Creek to be low amateur, and she contributed two points in the Palmer Cup.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t ready to leave UCLA. She began her sophomore season by closing with a 63 to win the Annika Invitational in the fall. She was runner-up in her next event. Her heart wasn\u2019t in turning pro just yet, and it showed.\n\nOf the top five college players at Q-Series, Tavatanakit was the only one who didn\u2019t make it.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to go,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was weird timing. Me being at Q-Series taught me to be sure, to be committed, to anything I do in life. I wanted to go back to LA when it was raining and cold. I wish there was a cut, but there wasn\u2019t. I had to play eight days. It was the worst two weeks of my life.\u201d\n\nBeing back in Westwood didn\u2019t make life any better. Golf was a struggle. She wasn\u2019t winning. She wasn\u2019t even contending.\n\n\u201cI had my worst finishes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a college event, the competition wasn\u2019t as strong, and I still managed to finish out of the top 20. When you\u2019re in college, half the girls are not going to turn pro. I put a lot of pressure on myself.\u201d\n\nShe finally won again at the NCAA regionals, but the Bruins crashed out at the NCAAs, and so did Tavatanakit, tying for 43rd in medal play.\n\nAnd then she turned pro, and before long it seemed like she couldn\u2019t lose.\n\nFunny game.\n\nMeanwhile, 98 women are teeing it up this week at Pinehurst No. 6, including college stars Sierra Brooks and Albane Valenzuela. It\u2019s different this year. The LPGA now gives college stars a pass into the second stage of qualifying, not directly to the final Q-Series stage.\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder for Tavatanakit of how unhappy she was playing golf, and how happy she is that it turned out the way it did.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t make it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou never know what would happen. I probably would have turned pro right away and forced myself to be committed to this. But I don\u2019t think I would have played like how I did this summer. I need to be down low to realize how golf is important to me and how much it takes to climb back up.\u201d\n\nThe Symetra Tour was ideal to teach her how to travel, use her time wisely and learn to be a pro. And even a short stint gave her time to explore new restaurants, though the UCLA foodie kept the posts to minimum at the final event.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the pressure - she had locked up her card by then - but the location. When it comes to eating, Daytona Beach is not Manhattan.\n\n\u201cI did post some stories, but yeah, nothing that great here,\u201d she said. \u201cThe beach is pretty.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "If everything had gone according to plan, Patty Tavatanakit would be in North Carolina this week preparing for two weeks of the LPGA Q-Series in her bid to earn status on the LPGA Tour.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Doug Ferguson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/22/on_the_fringe_patty_t_golf_27372_c0-224-5366-3354_s1200x700.jpg?140e9a309888b89dfca642894e640e1cc6ae453b", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
