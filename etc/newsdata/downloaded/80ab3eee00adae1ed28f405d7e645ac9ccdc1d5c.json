Many of the president's top economic officials are trying to resurrect the terms they previously were negotiating with China, a deal officials said was \"90 percent\" done before a sudden impasse this summer, according to a person familiar with the discussions.\n\n\u201cThat approach was rejected by the Chinese at the time, so it's unclear whether the new effort will overcome those hurdles and deliver U.S.-sought commitments from China on agriculture, intellectual property and technology transfer. The goal of the internal administration discussions is to forestall October tariff increases and the next tariffs set to take effect in December, with some advisers arguing that the economic hit is real and must be mitigated prior to the election year. But the discussions remain fluid and Trump has yet to endorse an approach.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- \u201cChina Seeks to Narrow Trade Talks With U.S. in Bid to Break Deadlock,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Lingling Wei and Chao Deng in Beijing: \u201cChina is looking to narrow the scope of its negotiations with the U.S. to only trade matters, putting thornier national-security issues on a separate track in a bid to break deadlocked talks with the U.S.\n\n\u201cChinese officials are hoping that such an approach would help both sides resolve some immediate issues and offer a path out of the current impasse, according to people familiar with the plan.\u201d WSJ\n\n-- TARIFFS, BUT MAKE IT FASHION \u2026 WSJ MAGAZINE\u2019S CHRISTINA BINKLEY: \u201cThe Hot Talk Off the Runway at Fashion Week: Tariffs: New York Fashion Week was at its most inclusive and optimistic in years \u2014 on the runways.

Weakening the Obama-era water rule had been a central campaign pledge for Mr. Trump, who characterized it as a federal land-grab that impinged on the rights of farmers, rural landowners and real estate developers to use their property as they see fit.\u201d NYT\n\n-- \u201cMnuchin says the Treasury is \u2018seriously considering\u2019 issuing a 50-year bond next year,\u201d by CNBC\u2019s Jeff Cox: \u201cThe U.S. could be issuing 50-year bonds as soon as next year as the government looks for cheaper and longer-term ways to finance its burgeoning debt load, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Thursday.\n\n\u201cMnunchin\u2019s comments come a day after President Donald Trump tweeted that he thinks the U.S. should look at \u2018refinancing\u2019 its debt load, which has recently eclipsed the $22.5 trillion mark. Government bond yields moved lower as Mnuchin spoke. Though it\u2019s unlikely the government could engage in that process the way a homeowner would refinance a mortgage, Treasury could extend the maturity of the debt by issuing longer-term bonds. The longest duration the government has now is the 30-year bond.\u201d CNBC\n\nTHE LATEST IN TURNBERRY -- \u201cAir Force nominee pledges to 'take a look at' troops staying at Trump properties,\u201d by Jacqueline Feldscher: \u201cThe Air Force secretary nominee said she will examine the issue of service members using President Donald Trump's properties amid a controversy over airmen spending the night at Trump\u2019s luxury Turnberry resort in Scotland.\n\n\u201cSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) asked Barbara Barrett during her Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearing to commit to carrying out a service-wide policy that would bar troops from staying at properties owned by the Trump Organization. But Barrett declined to say she would prohibit the practice, instead saying that she would look at implementing \u2018generic rules and regulations that look at the best value.\u2019\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- \u201cWhen Your Commander in Chief Is Also Providing Your Hotel Room,\u201d by NYT\u2019s David Kirkpatrick in Turnberry, Scotland, and Eric Lipton: \u201c[A]n examination of military layovers at Turnberry, including a two-day stay by a reporter at the resort, reveals a more complicated picture. There is little evidence of a systematic scheme to enrich Mr. Trump. But the military bookings at Turnberry are the latest in a series of episodes in which the president\u2019s private businesses have intersected with his public position in ways that he can profit from.\u201d NYT\n\nDEBATE PREP \u2026 WHAT TO WATCH FOR -- NYT\u2019S SHANE GOLDMACHER and ADRIANA RAMIC: \u201cThird Democratic Debate: The Top 10 on One Stage\u201d\n\n2020 WATCH -- \u201cThere are enough Latinos in the U.S. to change elections.

Though Google executives have long bragged about having a workplace culture designed to encourage open debate, current and former employees across the political spectrum have complained that they were retaliated against for raising concerns about equality and freedom of speech.\u201d WSJ\n\n-- \u201cFacebook Suspends Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party Bot for Hate Speech,\u201d by Bloomberg\u2019s Amy Teibel\n\n-- RECODE\u2019S TEDDY SCHLEIFER: \u201cThe FBI is investigating a venture capital fund started by Peter Thiel for financial misconduct\u201d: \u201cFederal investigators are probing the conduct and practices of Mithril Capital, a venture capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, Recode has learned. US officials \u2014 including the FBI \u2014 have in recent months questioned some people close to Mithril regarding concerns of financial misconduct at the firm, according to people familiar with the matter who insisted on anonymity given its sensitivity. Mithril confirmed in a statement that its lawyers are in touch with government authorities.\u201d Vox\n\nTHE FALWELL CHRONICLES -- \u201cFalwell blasted Liberty student as \u2018retarded,\u2019 police chief as \u2018half-wit\u2019 in emails,\u201d by Reuters\u2019 Aram Roston and Joshua Schneyer\n\nMEGATREND -- DEEP DIVE \u2026 \u201cThe changing face of school integration,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Laura Meckler and Kate Rabinowitz in Glenwood Springs, Colo.: \u201cThe number of children attending U.S. public schools with students of other races has nearly doubled over the past quarter century, a little-noticed surge that reflects the nation\u2019s shifting demographics, a Washington Post analysis has found.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, children in most big cities and many suburbs remain locked in deeply segregated districts, with black students more likely to be enrolled in segregated districts than Hispanics or whites, The Post found. In 2017, 10.8 million children attended highly integrated public schools, up from 5.9 million in 1995, an 83 percent increase that stems largely from rising diversity outside metropolitan areas. \u2026 Out of 46.4 million public school students, about 5.8 million attended schools that were not integrated in 2017.\u201d WaPo\n\nMEDIAWATCH -- Jay Shaylor is joining CBS as executive producer of \u201cCBS Evening News with Norah O\u2019Donnell.\u201d He previously was executive producer of CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.\u201d\n\n-- @brianstelter: \u201c'Fox & Friends' vet Lauren Petterson, currently Fox's SVP of A.M. programming & talent development, is the new president of Fox Business, succeeding Brian Jones.
