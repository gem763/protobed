It's exactly as long as the Note\u2019s screen is wide.\n\nThe Palm is small enough to fit into the smallest of pockets.\n\nIt\u2019s so small, it\u2019s hard to read anything on it, which means I almost never take it out of my pocket unless it\u2019s ringing or I\u2019ve just received a message. (The pocket, incidentally, is the coin pocket on my jeans, meaning I can use the bigger pockets to carry my keys without having to worry about scratching my phone.)\n\nGiven that uselessness is rather the point of the Palm, we have to give credit to TCL for pulling out all the stops.\n\nAs a result of the screen being so small, the on-screen keyboard is absolutely tiny, especially when you have the Palm in portrait mode, where the buttons are so minuscule you\u2019re basically relying on auto-correct for every other word. It\u2019s a little bigger and easier to type on in landscape mode, but we think you should turn that off in the phone\u2019s settings, to help the Palm achieve optimal uselessness.\n\nThe camera, meanwhile, is quite a lot better than we expected but, like the phone itself, it\u2019s not so good that you\u2019ll waste your life away trying to take the perfect selfie.\n\nBeing such a small device, its battery life isn\u2019t all that good either, which also helps to minimise usage. I\u2019ve just been scraping through to the end of each day on a single charge, having barely used the phone at all except for those calls and incoming messages.\n\nOrdinarily we\u2019d view that as a huge negative, but given that uselessness is rather the point of the Palm, we have to give credit to TCL for pulling out all the stops.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is one stop, however, they failed to pull out, and we wish they had. Overseas, there are two versions of the TCL Palm: a standalone version, and a companion version, also known as a useless version and a very useless version, respectively.\n\nUnfortunately, only the useless version has come to Australia.\n\nThat\u2019s the one with a SIM rather than an eSIM, meaning you either need to use it as your primary phone (and I\u2019m not sure that many people will have detoxed from smartphones sufficiently to put up with that), or you\u2019ll need to be constantly swapping your SIM card out of your main phone and the Palm, whenever you need the smaller, less distracting device.\n\nThe camera is OK, but you're likely to waste less time taking pictures, too.\n\n(The third alternative, to pay for a second phone account just for the Palm, is even less appealing than the first two. Not only will that cost you far more than you\u2019d likely be willing to pay, the phone would also be on a different number from your main phone, rather defeating the point of having a tiny device to carry with you when you don\u2019t want your big device.)\n\nThe eSIM version functions very much like an Apple Watch does: for a few extra dollars a month, you connect it to your main phone\u2019s account, allowing you to leave your big phone at home and yet still receive calls and messages when you\u2019re out and about.\n\nTechnically, the standalone version is less useless than the companion version, because it doesn\u2019t rely on you also having another phone, but from the point of view of overcoming phone addiction, it\u2019s far less useful than it should be.\n\nIt\u2019s such a hassle switching out the SIM on the standalone version of the Palm every time you want to go for a walk, it\u2019s likely the thing will quickly wind up in a drawer somewhere, gathering dust.\n\nBut maybe that\u2019s the point. Maybe all our phones should be like that: gathering dust, rather than hoovering up all our time.\n\nTCL PALM PHONE\n\nLikes Could help break a phone addiction\n\nDislikes Way too expensive.
