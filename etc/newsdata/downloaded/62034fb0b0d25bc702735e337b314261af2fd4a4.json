I realised that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.\u201d\n\nFollowing the release of Mr Vindman\u2019s testimony, the president repeated claims that the impeachment investigation is a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d.\n\n\u201cSupposedly, according to the Corrupt Media, the Ukraine call \u2018concerned\u2019 today\u2019s Never Trumper witness. Was he on the same call that I was? Can\u2019t be possible! Please ask him to read the Transcript of the call. Witch Hunt!\u201d\n\nA Ukrainian immigrant whose family fled the Soviet Union for New York City in 1979, Mr Vindman served in the Iraq War, where he was wounded by a roadside bomb, earning him a Purple Heart.\n\nRepublicans who have tried to undermine the investigation have called Mr Vindman\u2019s background into question while continuing to berate Democrats pursuing the president\u2019s impeachment.\n\nTo Fox News host Laura Ingraham, the \u201cinteresting angle\u201d of Mr Vindman\u2019s testimony wasn\u2019t his testimony of meetings with White House officials but that it was coming from a \u201csecurity official who is advising Ukraine, while working inside the White House, apparently against the president\u2019s interest\u201d.\n\n\u201cUsually, they spoke in English,\u201d she said.\n\nJohn Yoo, a former George W Bush administration official, told Ms Ingraham that Mr Vindman\u2019s role could be considered \u201cespionage\u201d.\n\nMr Vindman joined the White House\u2019s National Security Council in 2018 and reported to Fiona Hill, who served under now former national security advisor John Bolton.\n\nHe has argued that a \u201cstrong and independent Ukraine is critical to US national security interests because Ukraine is a frontline state and a bulwark against Russian aggression\u201d.\n\nEarlier this year, he said he \u201cbecame aware of outside influencers promoting a false narrative of Ukraine inconsistent with the consensus views of the interagency\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis narrative was harmful to US government policy,\u201d he said in his statement. \u201cWhile my interagency colleagues and I were becoming increasingly optimistic on Ukraine\u2019s prospects, this alternative narrative undermined US government efforts to expand cooperation with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nFollowing the election of Mr Zelensky in April 2019, Mr Vindman listened in on Mr Trump\u2019s phone call congratulating Ukraine\u2019s new president. The call was \u201cpositive\u201d and Mr Trump invited Mr Zelensky to the White House, Mr Vindman says. In May, he joined a delegation to Ukraine for Mr Zelensky\u2019s inauguration.", "description": "Democrats leading an impeachment probe into Donald Trump\u2018s alleged abuses of power in his dealings with Ukraine found the testimony of a high-ranking US official \u201cextremely disturbing\u201d and \u201cvery credible\u201d as the House prepares to take a formal vote on Mr Trump\u2019s impeachment.Acting House Oversight Committee", "authors": ["Alex Woodward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yPbzxhFHwARd.IsB62zjTQ--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/14cffd80e582b2eebcf11c81bccb819a", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
