Some show the new cameras, and some show the new photos those cameras can take; others show the processes that helped forge the phone, or how it will refuse to die even in the face of being dropped or doused in water.\n\nOne is less spectacular, yet it appears at every event. It features a checklist of specs, many of which are high-tech sounding abbreviations \u2013 \u201cBVR, PVC, mercury\u201d \u2013 but these are not features that Apple has added to the phone, but harmful materials that Apple has left out.\n\nThe card is Apple\u2019s response to a question that is asked, more and more, of every product: what harm does it do to the world. That response is intended to tout the work Apple has done to make its products less harmful, but also to acknowledge that plenty more is left to do.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cThis is so important to us,\u201d said marketing boss Phil Schiller as he brought the card up at the iPhone event. \u201cIt\u2019s why we bring it up every time. We want to keep pushing the boundaries of this.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of that introduction, Apple\u2019s Lisa Jackson \u2013 the company\u2019s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, and former head of the Environmental Protection Agency \u2013 is in London speaking proudly about the environmental advances in the new iPhone that sit alongside its improved processors and cameras. But she is also talking clearly about the work left to do, and the desire to speed up those improvements.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It\u2019s not \u2018look what we did\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s, \u2018we told you we\u2019re going to keep working on this, and every new product has some story\u2019.\u201d\n\nThis time around, in the new iPhone, the story Jackson says she is is most proud of is the materials inside the Taptic Engine, the little vibrating component that lets the phone give you a tiny nudge. To do so, it relies on magnets made of rare earth materials \u2013 and now those materials will be recycled, helping boost the environmental credentials of the new phone.\n\nThat same story is a reminder that there is plenty of work left to do, however. \u201cIt\u2019s about a quarter of all the rare earths you find in a typical iPhone, so it\u2019s not all done.\u201d\n\nBut it answers one of the substantial questions that plagued Apple when they announced that they would pursue a strategy of \u201cmake but not take\u201d and encourage the phones to be part of a circular economy that let old parts come into new iPhones. The mining of rare earth materials is a particularly harmful part of the creation of smartphones, but they are also particularly difficult to extract, critics said.\n\n\u201cI never quite understood that, because the reason they\u2019re rare is not because they\u2019re not found \u2013 it\u2019s because they\u2019re at very low concentration \u2013 so you have to put a lot of energy and time into getting them out if you mine them, so it would seem like putting energy and time into getting them out of devices would be smart too.\u201d\n\nThere are other parts of the new phone she is proud of: material from the iPhone-destroying machine Daisy are showing up in new machines, letting the aluminium from old devices be used in new ones, and the cobalt from old batteries is successfully recycled back into new ones.\n\nBut there are still materials and processes left to improve. Apple keeps making phones out of new materials, using new processes \u2013 and each of those poses a new challenge to those trying to keep that process as sustainable and environmentally sound as possible.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making progress. Sometimes you wish you could speed it all up,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have 14 materials we\u2019ve highlighted, and we don\u2019t have equal progress on them.\n\n\u201cBut some of that\u2019s technology. Some of that\u2019s scale. Some of that\u2019s crazy things, like shipping regulations and how you can move materials around. So we have to work on all of those at the same time.\u201d\n\nApple is trying to fix the technical issues with solutions similar to those used in its products, such as Daisy, which is a very precise and powerful iPhone disassembly machine that uses technological advances to pull apart phones rather than put them together.\n\nThe other issues are less high tech and just as difficult to solve: working with regulations about moving materials around, for instance, which requires detailed legal work to ensure that Apple is not accidentally breaking rules and laws as it attempts to create a circular economy. There are more traditional logistics questions, too, like ensuring that waste is not moved around so much that it generates more CO2 than the recycling actually saves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tons of fun if you\u2019re into this kind of thing,\u201d she says. \u201cBut tons of work.\u201d\n\nThese are not problems that will one day be cracked and go away, says Jackson. As Apple grows, so do the environmental challenges; just as Apple\u2019s phones are probably not going to stop getting faster, so the questions about sustainability are never going to go away.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I think it\u2019s going to go on forever \u2013 and I\u2019ll tell you why,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like when we got to 100 per cent renewable energy.\n\n\u201cIn 2017, Tim and I said we\u2019re now at 100 per cent around the world, but to stay at 100 per cent is constant work. Because we\u2019re constantly building new facilities, adding teams, adding stores, adding data centres \u2013 and all of those have to get to 100 per cent renewable pretty quickly.\u201d\n\nApple is going to keep creating new products, some of which might rely on new materials that are not immediately quite so sustainable. \u201cTo me, we are always going to try and go with the innovations, but we never want to hold back Apple innovations. We sort of, by definition, lag behind the innovations.\n\n\u201cIf Apple is working on some brand new material, we\u2019re going to have to figure out how to recycle that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we also work very closely to say: as you\u2019re speccing a material, is there a way to spec recycled material?\u201d\n\nTo try and ensure that question is asked as much as possible, one of the approaches that Jackson says she has pursued is to keep her team small \u2013 to try and infuse the aims of her team into the entire design process, rather than to parachute an environmental evangelist into the room and have them frustrate other designers. (Apple takes the same approach with privacy, trying to seed its principles into all of its staff rather than dropping in devoted watchdogs who could frustrate the process.)\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t grab a bunch of product designers or product engineers and bring them all into the environment team. First off, it\u2019s just not the way Apple works: the collaborative nature of design means if you\u2019re not sitting with the designers, maybe there\u2019s a problem.\n\n\u201cWe kept everyone where they were, and started to build a virtual team of people around the company who, in addition to everything else they do, would have a sensitivity and understanding of our goals around climate change and materials. Over time, that group has gotten bigger and further up the chain \u2013 we regularly now have discussions with designers very early in the process.\u201d\n\nJackson is very clear that this doesn\u2019t mean that the entirety of Apple, and its design process, is on board with such thinking. And those discussions can be difficult.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t have to sometimes make hard choices, because you\u2019re looking at performance, or a feature that might be really transformative. But we try as much as possible to avoid problems before they become a real challenge.\u201d\n\nOnce again, Jackson is clear that there is plenty of work left to do and plenty of criticisms left to make.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you everyone at Apple is thinking about it all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we have enough people who think it\u2019s really important to them to work for a company, and make a product, that they believe is being made in a way that\u2019s super sensitive to the planet.\u201d\n\nWith time that has filtered up to the very top of the company, she says, and the people who are presumably designing iPhones many years in the future.\n\nShe credits support from Tim Cook, and from hardware boss Dan Riccio, with helping instil those values more and more across the company. Those working on the products from the very outset, like Jony Ive \u2013 Apple\u2019s famous designer, who helped create its most famous products and is in the process of leaving the company \u2013 as well as design team leader Evans Hankey \u201care very sensitive to the fact that our products, as iconic and amazing as they are, also are really concerned that they be seen as great for the planet\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think it helps a lot that the folks who run those groups at the high level are also really committed to it, and asking the tough questions,\u201d she says.\n\nOnce again, Jackson is clear that Apple is not all the way to its goal, if it ever will be, and that there is plenty of work left to do. Apple's commitment to sustainable products might be clear but it is not necessarily fully realised, says Jackson, describing trips to colleagues at Apple to ask them about environmental questions.\n\n\u201cEvery once in a while I\u2019ll go into one of their offices and say, \u2018ah, what\u2019s going on?\u2019 And they\u2019ll say, \u2018OK OK OK, I didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t know\u2019. It\u2019s a big organisation, but we\u2019re getting there.\u201d\n\nApple\u2019s AirPods have come in for particular criticism: eventually, their battery stops working properly, and the small size and glue construction means it is not possible to replace them. At that point, they turn into a useless lump of plastic and battery.\n\nIn response to that problem, Apple offers the ability to swap old AirPods for new ones, charging $39 per stick for what is billed as a battery replacement but really means getting hold of a new one. The earphones themselves will then be shipped off to a devoted facility, where they will be stripped apart and mined for new materials.\n\nThe company also recently announced what it calls its Independent Repair Program, which allows shops to more easily fix broken Apple products and thereby, hopefully, prolong their life. That programme was launched \u201cbecause people are concerned\u201d, she says,\n\nDespite Apple\u2019s responses to those concerns, the criticism surely stuck in part because hardware companies have become such clear examples of consumption: assemblages of metal and plastic, all updated once a year and therefore just waiting to be thrown away. Jackson is open about the fact that the company could have done more to stress the work it is doing to counteract that view.\n\n\u201cWe hadn\u2019t in the past made it clear that this was part of who we are,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s on us; I think we\u2019re doing better at that.\u201d\n\nShe points to efforts it has made in afforestation, material recovery \u2013 or more spectacular responses like the fact the first premiere of a movie on the upcoming Apple TV+ service was The Elephant Queen, about animal habitats in Kenya.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re always going to have folks who stand on the side say, \u2018but you haven\u2019t done this\u2019,\u201d Jackson says. \u201cAnd I usually just say, \u2018yet\u2019.\u201d\n\nIf Apple keeps working to ensure that it\u2019s products are more and more sustainable, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that every other company will do the same, especially those who are not under the same sustained pressure that means that being green is a vital part of marketing and profits, as well as ethical principles. Other, cheaper companies without the same brand recognition could undercut more sustainable companies simply by flouting those commitments, and refusing to invest in sustainable production methods.\n\nThere could then be a danger that just like good design and fast performance, principles like sustainability and privacy become luxury goods, only available to those who can afford pricier products. Jackson disputes the idea that the iPhones are luxury products \u2013 \u201cI think they\u2019re high quality\u201d \u2013 but is also clear that she believes regulation is the way out of that issue.\n\n\u201cThe role of government is to make that not be OK. If there are goals that we say as a society we want, like clean air, clean water, addressing climate change, being really efficient with materials [\u2026] there\u2019s a role for enforcement and for holding people accountable.\u201d\n\nThat is a good argument as long as the politicians are on board. But that is far from guaranteed: the election of a climate change denier to be president of the US is surely an indication that, and the way attitudes can change in an instant.\n\n\u201cWell, the leadership changes,\u201d she says. \u201cThe scientists, and the folks who do the technical work \u2013 those who have remained \u2013 I think are generally of high integrity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s political science that can sometimes be the problem, not science.\u201d\n\nStill, it is the politicians that set the agenda. And inspiring though the work of environmental activists may be, there is still the danger that those politicians refuse to listen.\n\nBut Jackson says the arguments are getting easier to make.\n\n\u201cI think one of the advantages we have in this moment is that if you swept everything else aside, clean energy is actually cheaper,\u201d she says. \u201cAll of a sudden, we have an advantage that as an environmentalist we\u2019re not used to having: the thing we think is great is also cheaper. What public policy will have to do is fine a way to bring that through.\u201d\n\nThat could take a variety of forms, she says, such as carbon taxes. But it will be important to stress during that process that \u201cwe\u2019re not asking for the more expensive alternative\u201d, and that \u201cwe don\u2019t revert to our old way of thinking which is that I\u2019m asking you to put on some kind of control, and control costs money. I\u2019m actually asking to help transition to something that\u2019s better all around\u201d.\n\nThat simple, economic argument is cutting through, she says, and Apple\u2019s leadership is also being pushed by those who work for the company. It is not simply good economic sense to be environmentally friendly, she suggests, but a change that is demanded by the young and engaged workers of Silicon Valley and elsewhere.\n\nJackson says she saw some of that same youthful energy on show at the UN\u2019s Climate Week, from where she\u2019s just returned, and where Greta Thunberg delivered a blistering speech that attacked world leaders for their failure to attack.\n\n\u201cYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line.\u201d\n\nJackson is \u201cglad and happy\u201d to see herself as being part of that same movement.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing about that is it reminds you of the \u2018fierce urgency of now\u2019,\u201d Jackson says, quoting Martin Luther King. \u201cThe feeling that actually in all their anger and frustration is this belief that we\u2019ve got to do this \u2013 but we can do this.\u201d", "description": "Each year, when Apple takes to the vast stage in its even more vast headquarters to announce its new iPhone, executives stand in front of a series of cards.
