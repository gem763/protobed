Protesters were dressed in black, wearing veils and carrying white roses.\n\nPallbearers carried black coffins, one bearing the slogan \"OUR FUTURE,\" while other activists banged drums and waved flags featuring the hourglass-shaped Extinction symbol. Banners and placards carried by protesters read \"LIFE OR DEATH\" and \"R.I.P. LFW.\"\n\nProtesters cloaked in red gathered for an Extinction Rebellion demonstration on Tuesday in London.

Others spilled buckets of fake blood to create a \"bleeding red carpet,\" before lying down in the pools of fake blood to stage a \"die-in.\"\n\nExtinction Rebellion activists glued themselves to the entrance of London Fashion Week's central venue on September 13.
