Gavin Newsom grappling to ameliorate an epidemic that is unavoidable on city streets.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut a Washington Post report that the Trump administration is considering demolishing homeless encampments and moving unhoused people into government facilities caught elected officials here off guard. Mayors were left trying to determine if they were dealing with a speculative threat or the possibility of concrete, drastic action.\n\nNewsom has sparred with President Donald Trump before over homelessness, and a spokesperson assailed the president's record in a statement that California \"stands ready to talk\" if Trump is willing to discuss \"real investment\" in housing. Newsom's first budget, passed earlier this year, committed billions of dollars to housing and homelessness.\n\n\"[Trump] could start by ending his plans to cut food stamps, gut health care for low-income people, and scare immigrant families from accessing government services,\" spokesperson Nathan Click said.\n\nIn a head-snapping turn of events that illustrated the challenges California faces in working with a hostile and mercurial president, news of possible federal action dropped \u2014 bewildering officials \u2014 as Los Angeles officials were giving a tour to a Trump administration contingent focused on homelessness.\n\nA day earlier, the chief of state and federal affairs for Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti revealed the Trump delegation\u2019s visit, saying it was an opportunity for the city to explain \u201cour strategic plan around homelessness and sanitation deployment and Skid Row engagement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just not thoughtful, and quite frankly not smart enough, to know what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Garcetti aide Breelyn Pete said at a POLITICO event.\n\nOther mayors contending with spiking homeless populations said the reported administration effort was the wrong approach. San Francisco Mayor London Breed in a statement urged \u201cfederal support and resources to build more housing for people living on our streets\u201d rather than \u201csimply cracking down on homelessness without providing the housing that people need.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf \u2014 who infuriated the Trump administration and drew threats of retaliation after warning her residents of an impending immigration raid \u2014 accused Trump of \u201cpre-election political posturing at the expense of our most vulnerable residents.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been asking for federal assistance to address homelessness for years, and certainly I would welcome a change in heart from the president on this issue,\u201d Schaaf said in an interview with POLITICO. \u201cIt will taking housing and help \u2014 not crackdowns.\u201d\n\nSan Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, a moderate Republican, was more conciliatory, saying he would gladly accept \u201cadditional federal resources to help us move more individuals off the streets and into housing.\u201d\n\nTrump has taken aim at California\u2019s homelessness issues before, earlier this year telling Fox\u2019s Tucker Carlson that the federal government might be compelled to \u201cintercede.\u201d\n\nThat brought a tongue-in-cheek rebuke from Newsom, who said he welcomed federal help but was unsure the president \u201cknows what it means\u201d to float a potential intervention.\n\n\u201cIf interceding means cutting budgets to support services to get people off the street, he\u2019s been very successful in advancing those provisions in addition to the massive Social Security cuts and Medicare cuts \u2014 two things he promised he wouldn\u2019t do,\u201d Newsom said in July.", "description": "No issue is dominating the agenda in California like the housing shortage and homelessness spike.", "authors": ["Jeremy B.
