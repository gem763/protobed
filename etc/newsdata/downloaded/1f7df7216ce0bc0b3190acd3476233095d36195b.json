Ford, Marler and Kruis were all included on the eight-man reserves bench.\n\nVunipola has recovered from a hamstring strain and will make his first start of the tournament. Billy Vunipola has overcome an ankle injury and will start at No. 8.\n\nFarrell\u2019s shift from 12 to 10 and Tuilanga\u2019s move from outside to inside center to create a spot for Slade was done with defense in mind.\n\n\u201cAustralia are a clever team, they will have some specific attacking strategies to play against us so we need to have a great situational awareness,\u201d head coach Eddie Jones said. \u201cWe need to defend with brutality, and when we have the ball we need play on top of them.\u201d\n\nThe England XV contains 10 players who started in the 37-18 win over Australia last November.\n\nThe winner at Oita on Saturday will play either defending champion New Zealand or Ireland in the semifinals.\n\nEngland is aiming to make amends for failing to reach the knockout stage when it hosted the tournament in 2015, when losses to Australia and Wales in the pool phase were costly. Two-time champion Australia lost the final to New Zealand.\n\nEngland topped Pool C with wins over Tonga, the United States and Argentina, but it\u2019s last scheduled game against three-time finalist France was canceled last weekend because of Typhoon Hagibas. Australia placed second in Pool D after a narrow loss to Six Nations champion Wales.\n\n\u201cOnce you get to the quarterfinals it\u2019s about having the right mindset,\u201d said Jones, who guided Australia to the 2003 World Cup final, where the Wallabies lost in extra time to England. \u201cWe know how well we can play, it\u2019s about us playing to our strengths and trying to take away from what Australia want.\u201d\n\nJonny May, who has scored a try in each of his last two tests against Australia, will start on the left wing and will earn his 50th test cap.\n\n___\n\nEngland: Elliot Daly, Anthony Watson, Henry Slade, Manu Tuilagi, Jonny May, Owen Farrell (captain), Ben Youngs; Billy Vunipola, Sam Underhill, Tom Curry, Courtney Lawes, Maro Itoje, Kyle Sinckler, Jamie George, Mako Vunipola.
