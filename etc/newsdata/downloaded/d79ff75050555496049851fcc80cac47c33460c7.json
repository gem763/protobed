Bruce Maffeo, a former federal prosecutor now with the firm Cozen O\u2019Connor.\n\nIt quoted Len Egert, the union\u2019s national executive director, as saying the investigation would not be limited to conduct at a specific company or during a specific time. Egert said the investigation will \u201cexamine the systemic failures within the industry that could have allowed this conduct, if substantiated, to continue unchallenged for decades.\u201d\n\nDomingo\u2019s spokeswoman has called the allegations in the AP\u2019s stories \u201criddled with inconsistencies\u201d and \u201cin many ways, simply incorrect,\u201d but has offered no specifics.\n\nIn AP\u2019s initial Aug. 13 story , numerous women accused the long-married, Spanish-born superstar of sexual harassment or inappropriate, sexually charged behavior and of sometimes damaging their careers if they rejected him.\n\nIn a follow-up story published Thursday, singer Angela Turner Wilson told the AP that Domingo reached into her robe and forcefully grabbed her breast in a makeup room during a 1999 production at the Washington Opera, as the company was then called.\n\nWashington National Opera issued a statement saying it was \u201cdisturbed and disheartened\u201d by the new allegations, but did not say whether it planned to investigate them.\n\nOther women came forward to share new stories about encounters with Domingo that they said included unwanted touching, persistent requests for private get-togethers and sudden attempts to kiss them on the lips.\n\nSeveral backstage employees described for the AP how they strove to shield young women from the star as administrators looked the other way.\n\nThe union did not immediately return a call from the AP to further discuss its investigation.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The union that represents opera performers and staff has launched its own investigation into sexual harassment allegations against superstar Placido Domingo, saying it cannot be sure that opera companies will delve into them sufficiently themselves.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jocelyn Gecker", "Jocelyn Noveck"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/sexual_misconduct_placido_domingo_10249_c0-327-6573-4159_s1770x1032.jpg?3c43abc260c3197b94d33976b1d2537b01c59da3", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
