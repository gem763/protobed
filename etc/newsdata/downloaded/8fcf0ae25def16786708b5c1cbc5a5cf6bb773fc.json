That's when I started doing activist performances,\" the 43-year-old earlier told Al Jazeera, dressed as a clownish scarecrow in a mining hat.\n\nNearby, a group of protesters blocked off all entrances to Trafalgar Square by locking themselves to vehicles including a symbolic funeral car.\n\nArtists, musicians and other celebrities including actress Juliet Stevenson and environmental journalist George Monbiot were among those present.\n\nScores arrested\n\nEarlier in the day, protesters had locked themselves onto a fake nuclear missile in front of the Ministry of Defence, leading to the arrest of 23 people including an 81-year-old Quaker and a 66-year-old retired naval officer, according to the group.\n\n190519055155405\n\nBy early afternoon, police said they had carried out 135 arrests. Eleven people had been held on Saturday and Sunday on suspicion of conspiracy to cause public nuisance. Food, bins and portable toilets were confiscated from a warehouse in south London, as well as six vehicles used to transport them.\n\nExtinction Rebellion, which says it has more than 480 active groups in 72 countries, is known for its civil disobedience tactics, including activists volunteering for arrest.\n\n\"I'm in a privileged position,\" said Joel, one of the activists locked to the funeral car on Trafalgar Square who said he was willing to get detained. \"Many people around the world can't protest because they haven't got the resources or the time, or they're scared of the harm it might cause them,\" he added.\n\nThroughout the day, volunteers brought cushions, food and water to those who locked themselves to visitors and to each other.\n\nPolice said they had carried out 135 arrests [Ylenia Gostoli/Al Jazeera]\n\n'Up to us to raise awareness'\n\nIn April, thousands of people blocked sites around London by disrupting traffic with \"mass die-ins\", glueing themselves to trains and smashing the windows of oil giant Shell's headquarters. More than 1,000 people were arrested, many of whom are currently facing trial.\n\nThis led to the UK government passing a non-binding resolution declaring an environment and climate emergency, one of Extinction Rebellion's key demands. It was approved without a vote after a motion was tabled by Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party.\n\n\"The science says exactly the opposite of what governments are doing,\" Max, a 35-year-old molecular geneticist originally from Germany, told Al Jazeera. \"I think none of the governments are really doing enough, and it's up to us to raise awareness.\"\n\nSimultaneous protests took place in countries around the world, from New Zealand through Colombia to the Gambia.\n\nIn London, Extinction Rebellion expects between 20,000 and 30,000 people from local groups across the UK to make their way to the capital over the next two weeks, aiming to cause disruption to get the government to act on the climate crisis.\n\nThey want the government to commit to reducing carbon emissions to net-zero by 2025 and create a Citizens' Assembly to lead decisions on the climate crisis.\n\nThe movement hopes this round of protests will be five times bigger than their \"April rebellion\", and said that 5,000 people have volunteered to be arrested, 2,245 are willing to go to prison and 1,836 are willing to go on hunger strike.\n\nPlanned events include a sit-in at London's City Airport, a march on October 12, and the disruption of an oil and gas summit.", "description": "Scores arrested as climate activists descend on centre of UK capital to demand urgent gov't action on climate change.", "authors": ["Ylenia Gostoli"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/7/cd819055005a43ba80c3ff51036a100c_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
