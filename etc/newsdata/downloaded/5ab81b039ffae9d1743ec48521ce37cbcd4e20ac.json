The plaintiffs are clearly going to say this lab director worked for J&J for years, and he found asbestos so there must be asbestos there.\u201d\n\nJ&J\u2019s challenge now is to discredit the single test result as erroneous without undermining the reputation and track record of its expert witness, Ausness said.\n\n\u201cJ&J could try to frame it as not so much this lab director is unreliable or incompetent, but false positives do happen and additional tests are called for,\u201d Ausness said.\n\nThe company appeared to do just that on Tuesday, saying testing done by other laboratories J&J hired had found no asbestos in the same bottle of Baby Powder tested by Saldivar for the FDA, nor in the lot of Baby Powder recalled as a result of Saldivar\u2019s finding.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, FDA officials said they stood by the AMA lab and its results. They also said they were not surprised by J&J\u2019s findings because contaminants are not uniformly dispersed throughout talc and different testing methods can yield varying results.\n\nThe company \u201cwould say the product is free of asbestos based on their testing, and we would say the opposite for that sample,\u201d said Steve Musser, deputy director for scientific operations in FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 attorneys said Saldivar\u2019s finding for the FDA could be detrimental to J&J\u2019s defense in court. The company faces lawsuits from more than 16,000 people alleging that asbestos in its powders caused cancer.\n\nThe impact was immediate in one courtroom.\n\nHours after J&J disclosed the FDA\u2019s asbestos finding on Oct. 18, a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer, Nate Finch, asked an Indianapolis judge to let him tell the jury about it in a trial involving a 71-year-old woman who alleged that Baby Powder contributed to her cancer.\n\nJ&J\u2019s lawyers opposed the request, arguing that the information could prejudice the jury against the company, but the judge granted Finch\u2019s request. Days later, Finch told the judge his client had come to a confidential resolution with J&J, a trial transcript shows. Finch told Reuters he could not comment on the resolution.\n\nJ&J did not respond to questions about the Indianapolis case. The company declined to comment on Saldivar\u2019s role in the FDA testing, or on how it might affect the company\u2019s legal strategy going forward.\n\nSaldivar declined to comment.\n\n\n\n\n\nNO SAFE LEVELS\n\nIn a June deposition, Saldivar said J&J lawyers had retained him in 2017 as a company expert in \u201cmaybe 20 or 30\u201d cases. His firm bills $200 to $350 an hour for his services, he testified.\n\nUnder the FDA contract, his lab found asbestos fibers in the Baby Powder sample on Sept. 7, according to the lab\u2019s report. J&J said it was notified of the finding by FDA officials on Oct. 16, prompting the company to recall 33,000 bottles \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d", "description": "On Tuesday, for example, J&J announced that other labs it  hired ultimately found no asbestos in samples from the bottle tested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or from the same production lot.
