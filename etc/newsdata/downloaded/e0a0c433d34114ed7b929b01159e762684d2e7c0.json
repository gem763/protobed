Even the title, Triggered, is designed to make the veins on the foreheads of liberals pulsate.\n\nPlaying on that idea, Trump Jr has created a website in which he invites fans to buy copies of Triggered that will be delivered automatically to their least favorite liberal. At $21 a copy, that\u2019s an expensive ruse to upset Clinton, Nancy Pelosi or Mitt Romney, the Republican senator and Trump critic who is provocatively included among the six \u201cliberal\u201d targets.\n\nTrump Jr tells readers he did not set out in writing Triggered to offend anyone. Which is surprising, as he does such a good job at precisely that.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is a \u201cfeeble old fool\u201d at the head of a \u201ccrooked investigation\u201d; conservative commentator Bill Kristol is a rat; the Squad of four leftwing congresswomen that includes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, should be renamed \u201cHamas caucus\u201d; George W Bush is a loser like Romney.\n\nAs for CNN, the news channel that the US president has made his media whipping boy, its newscasters are nothing less than \u201cfull of shit\u201d.\n\nHistorians of the Trump era are unlikely to find much solid material to mine within Triggered. Though the author follows his father\u2019s protocol in attacking the former FBI director James Comey, he barely mentions what he calls \u201cthe infamous Trump Tower meeting \u2026 which supposedly exposed me as a Russian spy\u201d.\n\nIn that meeting, on 9 June 2016, Trump Jr, his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and the campaign chair, Paul Manafort, met a Russian lawyer with links to the Kremlin who said she could offer dirt on Hillary Clinton. Nor does Trump Jr discuss his infamous reply to an email setting up the meeting: \u201cIf it\u2019s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.\u201d\n\nHe also \u2013 like his father \u2013 appears to play a little fast and loose with the facts.\n\nTrump Jr accuses Comey of alerting the press to the supposed importance of the Steele dossier, a file of opposition research on links between Trump and Moscow, after briefing the president-elect about it. But in doing so, he misstates the date \u2013 by a year.\n\nRelated: Trigger warning: how did \u2018triggered\u2019 come to mean \u2018upset\u2019?\n\n\u201cAll [Comey] had to do,\u201d he writes, \u201cwas hand the phoney dossier to the president-elect during an official visit and then leak the visit to the press. Presto chango! In that moment on January 7, 2016, the dossier went from a pile of garbage to a document in an official intelligence briefing.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the FBI came into possession of the Steele dossier on 9 December 2016, when the Republican senator John McCain handed it to Comey. Concerned about Russia\u2019s untroubled response to sanctions imposed by Barack Obama, and knowing the media had copies of the dossier, Comey and other officials briefed the White House about it on 5 January 2017.\n\nComey then briefed Trump on 6 January 2017, an encounter that would stay out of the public sphere until it was described in Comey\u2019s own book, A Higher Loyalty. Buzzfeed, which obtained the dossier from a McCain aide in December 2016, published it in full on 10 January.\n\nIn tune with his fleeting mention of the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer, Trump Jr\u2019s book is notable as much for what it doesn\u2019t say as for what it does. He praises his father for the way he encouraged ordinary working people among his staff, but avoids referring to the dozens of Trump employees who were undocumented immigrants.", "description": "The first son\u2019s 294-page rant against American liberals is more notable for what it doesn\u2019t say than for what it doesDonald Trump Jr. throws hats to supporters o fhis father at a campaign rally in Orlando, Florida, in June.
