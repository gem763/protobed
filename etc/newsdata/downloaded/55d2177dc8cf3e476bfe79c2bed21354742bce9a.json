It\u2019s one game at a time and go out and play the game and hope to stay injury free.\u201d\n\nOne player eager to start the season is defenseman Nate Schmidt, who missed the first 20 games last year while serving a suspension for violating the NHL\u2019s performance-enhancing drug policy. Schmidt has been all smiles this year and the liveliest player in the locker room.\n\n\u201cI told Turk (Gallant) I\u2019ll play all seven (preseason) games if it could delete what happened last year in comparison, because it just feels good to be back,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cPreseason or not, it feels good to be back in the mix with the guys.\u201d\n\nThe feeling is likely mutual as Vegas opened last season 8-11-1 without Schmidt then went on a 19-4-3 tear when he rejoined the team.\n\nWHO\u2019S HERE: Schmidt, G Marc-Andre Fleury, F William Karlsson, RW Mark Stone, LW Jonathan Marchessault.\n\nWHO\u2019S NOT: F Erik Haula, C Ryan Carpenter, C Pierre-Edouard Bellemare.\n\nKEY PLAYERS: The Golden Knights closed their 2018 season on an 11-6-2 run after Mark Stone arrived via trade with Ottawa. He had five goals and six assists in the 18 games but he really came to life during the team\u2019s seven-game series with San Jose, registering six goals and six assists. His 25 overall games with Vegas was a mere preview of what the team can expect with him in uniform the entire season.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no secret to how he plays, he\u2019s just the smartest guy out there,\u201d Jonathan Marchessault said. \u201cHe makes everybody look better, and I think that\u2019s probably the best quality to have as a hockey player.\u201d\n\nStone, Marchessault, Reilly Smith, Karlsson, Max Pacioretty and Paul Stastny comprise the top six. Third-line forward Cody Eakin is coming off a career-best 22 goals and 41 points and should be motivated entering the final year of his contract. The 28-year-old downplayed the need for a second straight breakout season, but his performance could dictate where he lands next year.\n\n\u201cWhen you play the right way, team first, you get rewarded and that\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about when it comes to winning hockey games,\u201d Eakin said.\n\nOn defense, Dylan Coghlan may have emerged as the dark horse during the preseason, as the hard-shooting prospect has shown offensive potential that would bolster a third pairing on the blue line.\n\nOUTLOOK: The scoring is there for the Golden Knights, the defensive pairings are solid, and it could come down to the 34-year-old Fleury. Last year he started 34 of Vegas\u2019 first 40 games, including 13 straight during one stretch.\n\n\u201cCommon sense says you don\u2019t want to play him as much as you played him in the past, but we\u2019re gonna see how the schedule goes and see how he\u2019s going and see how he\u2019s playing and we\u2019ll go from there,\u201d Gallant said.\n\nGallant said he\u2019ll confer with goaltender coach Dave Prior on who will be in net each game, and that Fleury has input on his playing time.\n\n\u201cWe have a plan,\u201d Fleury said. \u201cI try to manage my body throughout the season to rest maybe and recover better than I used to.\u201d\n\nPREDICTION: Everyone in the locker room has said it\u2019s time to turn the page. The Golden Knights held a 3-1 series lead in the first round against San Jose last year and a commanding 3-0 lead in Game 7 before losing to the Sharks 5-4 in overtime. It still stings, and Vegas wants revenge. With a healthy lineup, among the best forward groups in the league and Fleury in net, another Western Conference Final is certainly possible.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Expectations for the Vegas Golden Knights remain as high as ever two years after reaching the Stanley Cup Final.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "W.G.
