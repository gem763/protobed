Producer and activist Andrew Duncan bought 300 tickets to tonight's Nets vs Raptors game and is hosting hundreds of Chinese pro-Democracy activists to protest the NBA.\n\n\n\nThey're all wearing \"Stand With Hong Kong\" t-shirts pic.twitter.com/pIcUwSLaPB \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) October 19, 2019\n\nAround 100 spectators wore black shirts that read \u201cStand with Hong Kong,\u201d while holding signs and chanting pro-democracy slogans during the game. Another dozen fans demonstrated on behalf of the Tibetan freedom movement, though it was unclear if the two protests were related.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe want to use our performance art to show our support for Hong Kong and the NBA,\u201d one organizer, author Chen Pokong, 55, told the New York Post.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt seems like NBA people cannot choose their words,\u201d he added. \u201cSo if we don\u2019t stop them, they not only will do bad things in China, they will do bad things in America.\u201d\n\nHours later commentary that aired on state broadcaster CCTV warned that NBA Commissioner Adam Silver would receive \u201cretribution sooner or later,\u201d according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nSilver said earlier in the week that Chinese officials urged the NBA to fire Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey over his since-deleted tweet in support of the protest movement in Hong Kong. The Chinese government denied ever making that request.\n\nAD\n\nThe CCTV commentary declared Silver had \u201cdefamed\u201d China and had \u201cproblems in his character.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo please some American politicians, Silver has fabricated lies out of nothing and has sought to paint China as unforgiving,\u201d it said.\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s likely to further inflame tensions in a disagreement that won\u2019t seem to die down. Many NBA fans remain upset with LeBron James for his comments on Morey and the situation in Hong Kong.\n\nAfter the game, Nets guard Kyrie Irving sympathized with players and other NBA personnel who want to speak out in support of the Hong Kong protesters.\n\n\u201c[People of color] here in America, we\u2019re still fighting for everyday freedom, so when I think about Hong Kong and China, the people are in an uproar,\u201d he said. \u201cFor us as Americans, as African Americans or American Indians, to comment on that, you\u2019re connected nonetheless, especially when it impacts freedoms or world peace.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAmerica was built on protesting, built on slavery...\u201d pic.twitter.com/DThliHG9gf \u2014 Malika Andrews (@malika_andrews) October 19, 2019\n\nThe Nets and Lakers played games in China in the immediate aftermath of Morey\u2019s tweet. The NBA canceled media availability with players from both teams in an attempt to manage the situation.\n\nAD\n\nNets owner Joseph Tsai criticized Morey\u2019s tweet in a Facebook post and said the rupture between the NBA and Chinese fans \u201cwill take a long time to repair.\u201d He called the Hong Kong protests a \u201cseparatist movement\u201d that threatened to compromise \u201cthe territorial integrity of China and the country\u2019s sovereignty over her homeland.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "The NBA is back from its preseason circuit in China, and the controversy stemming from its trip is, too.", "authors": ["Jacob Bogage", "National Sports Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/li9dEu1DofjozypoUq9TeWuabtI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HYRJPTKURRAU3KILFL5CNGGE2Q", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
