Maybe you\u2019re in the mood for a new TV series to binge or a classic you haven\u2019t seen in a generation? A lot of people would rather spend hours or even days with the same characters in a TV series, and Netflix has one for every mood. Here are the 100 best TV shows you could binge right now, updated regularly as new shows enter and old shows leave. Watch all of them and report back.\n\nAlias Grace\n\nDirected by Mary Harron (American Psycho) and written by Sarah Polley, this miniseries adaptation of Margaret Atwood\u2019s brilliant 1996 novel didn\u2019t get enough attention when Netflix dropped it in November 2017. Sarah Gadon is remarkable as Grace Marks, a murderer who may be pardoned for her crimes for reasons of insanity. A deft commentary on women\u2019s issues, Alias Grace deserves comparisons to that other little Atwood streaming hit, A Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\n\nAmerican Crime\n\nABC\u2019s topical drama never quite found ratings success as it always felt like the kind of thing better suited to cable TV than network. The winner of multiple Emmys for Regina King \u2014 as well as nominations for Felicity Huffman, Lili Taylor, Timothy Hutton, and Richard Cabral \u2014 American Crime told a different story in each of its three seasons, using much of the same ensemble in different roles each year. It\u2019s a riveting, conversation-starting drama.\n\nAmerican Crime Story\n\nBoth iterations of Ryan Murphy\u2019s hit crime anthology series \u2014 The People vs. OJ Simpson and The Assassination of Gianni Versace \u2014 are available on Netflix. The first iteration is a flat-out masterpiece with one of the best modern TV performances from Sarah Paulson, and the second is pretty interesting in its own right. You can burn through both of these in a weekend. It\u2019s a show made for binging.\n\nAmerican Horror Story\n\nThe multiple seasons of FX\u2019s hit show have been a rollercoaster in terms of quality but just strap in and enjoy the ride. The latest outing (Apocalypse) isn\u2019t quite on here yet but should be before the newest iteration premieres. The other seven are all here. Start with Murder House, of course, which is still the best of the seven seasons, but almost all of them have interesting beats, especially the 2017 Cult.\n\nAmerican Vandal\n\nThe first Netflix series on this list is also one of the best, a brilliant spoof of true crime documentaries that also serves as a clever commentary on teen life in the digital age. The first season \u2014 about a vandal who sprays male appendages on all the cars in the faculty parking lot \u2014 is arguably funnier than the feces-focused second year, but they both have value. And a lot of laughs. Netflix has axed the show, but there are rumors someone else may be interested in picking it up.\n\nAnthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown\n\nThe tragic passing of Anthony Bourdain led a lot of viewers to his food and travel shows, revealing the depth of his charm. Bourdain\u2019s appeal was in his fearlessness and his belief that seeing the world made life more vibrant. This show won five Emmys and ran for twelve seasons on CNN. Five of them (7-11) are currently on Netflix.\n\nArrested Development\n\nHas the current quality of Arrested Development allowed you to forget that the first three seasons were pure genius? Don\u2019t let that happen. Go back and watch the early brilliance of the Bluth family saga, and you may even want to dip your toe in the revival a bit too before it returns on March 15th.\n\nAsh vs. Evil Dead\n\nSince Ash rode off into the medieval sunset in 1989\u2019s Army of Darkness, there were several aborted attempts to bring the cynical killer of the undead back to the big screen, but he actually ended up on the small one, in this three-season wonder from Starz. Bruce Campbell, the star of Evil Dead 2 and living legend, returns as Ash, as do the trademark practical effects and cheesy humor from the Sam Raimi films. It\u2019s a lot of fun.\n\n*Atypical\n\nRobia Rashid\u2019s coming-of-age comedy developed into something smart and insightful in its second season, anchored by solid performances from Jennifer Jason Leigh and Michael Rapaport. The two veteran actors play the parents of 18-year-old Sam Gardner (played by Keir Gilchrist), who is on the autism spectrum. After some criticism that met season one, the show added more actors and writers on the spectrum themselves, and it became a stronger show. A third season has already been announced.\n\nBates Motel\n\nWhen a prequel TV series to Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s classic Psycho was announced, it sounded like a very bad idea. What more could possibly be said about the life of Norman Bates? However, the A&E series actually developed into an insightful and fascinating examination of the debilitating relationship between Freddie Highmore\u2019s Norman and Vera Farmiga\u2019s Norma, his just-as-twisted mother.\n\nBetter Call Saul\n\nThe prequel to Breaking Bad has arguably surpassed its ancestor in terms of depth and performance. Bob Odenkirk stars as Jimmy McGill, the man who will someday become Walter White\u2019s attorney. If Walter\u2019s story was about a man going bad, this show is about a man trying to stay good. It\u2019s one of the best shows of the \u201810s, and you can catch up now on Netflix before it returns to AMC.\n\nBig Mouth\n\nNetflix has been really adventurous in its animated programming for adults with hits like BoJack Horseman, and this raunchy comedy from co-creators Nick Kroll and John Mulaney is one of its best. The voice work in this insightful look at teen horniness is quite simply some of the finest in the history of animation, with great contributions from Kroll, Mulaney, Jenny Slate, Jordan Peele, Jason Mantzoukas, and the scene-stealing Maya Rudolph.\n\nBlack Mirror\n\nIt\u2019s Charlie Brooker\u2019s world, we just live in it. The modern answer to The Twilight Zone (at least until CBS All Access actually revives that show) is one of the most buzzed-about programs of the \u201810s. You simply have to see what all of the hype is about, don\u2019t you? Watch it now before our technological overlords force you to.\n\nBloodline\n\nThe first season of this Netflix thriller, nominated for an Emmy in 20115, is really one of those that ushered in the second wave of original series success for the streaming service. The show never quite lived up to that brilliant first year, but there\u2019s really great work throughout from Kyle Chandler, Sissy Spacek, Linda Cardellini, and especially Ben Mendelsohn. They all play members of a Florida family caught up in a web of lies and betrayal.\n\nBodyguard\n\nThe surprise Golden Globe winner for Best Actor in a Drama earlier this year was a Netflix show that most people stateside hadn\u2019t really heard of yet. Their friends across the pond sure knew what it was as Bodyguard was the biggest hit over there in over a decade. Fans of tense spy shows like 24 and Homeland shouldn\u2019t miss this tight, 6-episode mini-series about a guard for a Home Secretary in the U.K.\n\nBoJack Horseman\n\nAny conversation about the best animated programs on TV has to include Netflix\u2019s Hollywood parody about, well, a depressed talking horse. BoJack Horseman is a difficult show to explain to someone who\u2019s never seen it. It\u2019s a goofy, pun-filled show about an over-the-hill TV star who happens to be a horse, but it\u2019s also an insightful document of mental illness, depression, trauma, and loneliness. All that and a talking dog named Mr. Peanutbutter too.\n\nBreaking Bad\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve heard of it? If there\u2019s any chance you have yet to see one of the most acclaimed shows of the modern age, it\u2019s right here for you to make up for the biggest hole in your personal TV canon. If you\u2019ve been under a rock, Bryan Cranston gives one of the best performances in TV history as an average man who becomes an above-average drug lord. Even if you\u2019ve seen it, it\u2019s worth watching again.\n\nBroadchurch\n\nForget the American remake and go watch the amazing first season of this BBC mystery, starring David Tennant of Marvel\u2019s Jessica Jones and one of our newest Oscar winners, Olivia Colman, giving one of her best performances. The first season, which has a self-contained mystery about a boy\u2019s body found on a beach in a small town, is a masterpiece. The other two not so much.\n\nCheers\n\nAny list of the best TV comedies of all time that doesn\u2019t include Cheers is just wrong. For most of the \u201880s, this was quite simply the best show on TV, and it\u2019s held up incredibly well over the years. It\u2019s still laugh-out-loud hysterical, anchored by one of the best ensembles in comedy TV history and razor-sharp writing. There\u2019s a reason this show won 28 Emmys.\n\nThe Crown\n\nOne of Netflix\u2019s most beloved shows is really just getting started. Peter Morgan\u2019s creation is designed to chronicle the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, and well, she\u2019s been in charge since 1952. Claire Foy played the young Queen in the first two seasons, but she\u2019s been replaced by Oscar winner Olivia Colman for the next two. Catch up before they get to Princess Diana.\n\nDark\n\nThis German import has become a cult hit through word of mouth on Netflix for a good reason. With echoes of shows like Stranger Things and Fringe, Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese\u2019s has a little bit of everything for genre fans, including missing children and the possibility of time travel. It\u2019s a weird little show that feels like it echoes some American genre hits but also has its own distinct voice. A third and final season has already been commissioned, so don\u2019t worry about plot threads never being resolved.\n\nDead to Me\n\nChristina Applegate does the best work of her career and Linda Cardellini nearly matches her in this mystery-comedy about grief, forgiveness, and murder. Applegate plays Jen, a Californian whose husband was recently killed in a hit-and-run. Jen meets Cardellini\u2019s Judy in a grief support group and comes to learn that Judy has a connection to her husband\u2019s murder. Funny, moving, and clever, this is one of Netflix\u2019s best new shows in a long time.\n\nDear White People\n\nOne of Netflix\u2019s most underrated and smartest shows comes courtesy of Justin Simien, who has adapted his Sundance comedy into a brilliant commentary on race relations on modern campuses. With a great ensemble and razor-sharp writing, this is the best current show about what it\u2019s like to be young in the digital age.\n\nDexter\n\nAt the peak of the anti-hero, Showtime gave us one for the ages, Dexter Morgan, a serial killer with a code. Played by Michael C. Hall, Dexter is a Florida man who feeds his urge to kill by making sure those he dispatches deserve to die. There\u2019s some bumpy ground over the show\u2019s entire run, but Hall is excellent from the unforgettable premiere to the divisive finale.\n\nThe Disappearance of Madeleine McCann\n\nChris Smith is a fantastic documentarian. Perhaps you\u2019ve seen his beloved American Movie, doc about Jim Carrey & Andy Kaufman (Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond), or recent take on the legendary festival of the damned, Fyre. He helmed this 8-part docu-series about the heartbreaking and fascinating story of Madeleine McCann, a 3-year-old girl who disappeared while on a trip to Portugal with her family. Even if you think you know a lot about this case, watch this series. It\u2019s one of the best true crime documents on Netflix.\n\nDisenchantment\n\nMatt Groening\u2019s return to animation felt like a disappointment to loyal fans of The Simpsons and Futurama, especially at the rocky start to the first season, but this show developed into something smart and fun by the end of its freshman year and there\u2019s reason to be excited for the upcoming second outing. This clever fractured fairy tale is buoyed by incredible voice work from Abby Jacobson, Eric Andre, Nat Faxon, and a cadre of Groening veterans.\n\nDocumentary Now!\n\nCreated by Seth Meyers, Fred Armisen, and Bill Hader, this IFC hit parodies some of the most famous documentaries of all time. Now on the network for its third season, Netflix is the place to catch up on the first two, including hysterical spoofs of Grey Gardens, The War Room, Stop Making Sense, and Jiro Dreams of Sushi.\n\nThe End of the Fucking World\n\nThe darkest of dark comedies, this BBC import stars Alex Lawther as a kid who is kinda considering becoming a serial killer when he runs into a force of nature named Alyssa, unforgettably played by Jessica Barden. Twisting and turning, this bloody teen romance isn\u2019t quite like any other and shall return for a second season later this year.\n\nEpisodes\n\nEveryone with a Netflix subscription apparently watched Friends \u2014 it\u2019s often the most-streamed show on the service \u2014 so let\u2019s hope a few take the chance to watch Matt LeBlanc\u2019s clever riff on his own celebrity in this Showtime-BBC collaboration. Airing for five seasons on the cable network, Episodes is about a couple of Brits who get mired in the quicksand of the Hollywood TV system. It\u2019s smart, funny, scathing TV.\n\nEverything Sucks!\n\nSadly, this is a one-season wonder for Netflix, but it\u2019s still one of the best shows on the service \u2014 which says something about the cancellation decisions it\u2019s making lately. Jai Di\u2019Allo Winston and Peyton Kennedy star in a delicately written and gentle comedy about growing up in a town called Boring in the mid-\u201990s. It\u2019s one of the smartest modern shows about complex teen issues like sexuality and mental health \u2014 so, of course, Netflix canceled it. Watch it so maybe it\u2019ll correct that mistake.\n\nExhibit A\n\nShows like Criminal Minds and CSI have made things like cadaver dogs and DNA testing into elements of crime-solving that everyone thinks they fully understand. This fascinating docu-series shows how often evidence can be flawed. Nothing exists in a vacuum and it takes people to interpret things like blood splatter and video evidence to make them valuable. And if the wrong people make mistakes, the cost can be drastic.\n\nExtras\n\nEveryone points to Ricky Gervais\u2019 The Office as the controversial comedian\u2019s best TV creation, but this is a very close second. Created with Stephen Merchant, Extras stars Gervais as, well, a professional extra. The structure allows for a different famous guest star every week, including unforgettable episodes with Kate Winslet, Ian McKellen, and Ben Stiller, all playing variations of themselves.\n\nF Is for Family\n\nBill Burr is one of the funniest modern stand-ups \u2014 watch all of the specials of his you can find \u2014 and his viewpoint is deftly captured in this animated comedy that\u2019s been on for three seasons and counting. Set in the early \u201970s, this relatively standard family sitcom in animated form is led by Burr, but he\u2019s ably assisted by a great voice cast that includes Laura Dern, Justin Long, and Sam Rockwell.\n\n*The Fall\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Mindhunter or the catalog of crime shows on Netflix, dig deeper and unearth this British drama from the mid-\u201810s starring Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan. The former Scully plays Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson, who is brought into case in Northern Island that she discovers may be the work of a serial killer \u2014 Dornan plays the killer. The show can be a bit intense, but the way it intercuts between investigator and criminal keeps it consistently fascinating.\n\nFive Came Back\n\nWhether or not a four-part documentary is something that should qualify as a TV series is an argument for another time, but this probably would have played on PBS or HBO were it not a Netflix Original, so it qualifies for us. It\u2019s a phenomenal docuseries based on Mark Harris\u2019 book about five classic directors who experienced World War II first hand as filmmakers: John Ford, William Wyler, John Huston, Frank Capra, and George Stevens. (Three episodes available)\n\nFrasier\n\nWhat\u2019s better: Cheers or Frasier? And is this the best spin-off ever? Why don\u2019t you watch the massive NBC hit that won so many Emmys that they practically had to disqualify it to let other people get a chance and get back to us? In all seriousness, the saga of Frasier Crane and his put-upon brother Niles has held up marvelously. Frasier\u2019s regularly-defeated pomposity will never not be funny.\n\nFriends\n\nWhen it looked like Netflix might lose rights to this beloved show recently, fans lost their minds. Apparently, there are already legions of people revisiting Central Park and hanging out with Rachel, Ross, Monica, Joey, Phoebe, and Chandler like it\u2019s the \u201990s all over again. Why don\u2019t you join them while you still can.\n\nGLOW\n\nThe show about the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling is way more than just a parody of leotards and \u201880s hairdos. Over two seasons, it\u2019s become a delicately balanced look at female friendship and competition, anchored by great performances from Alison Brie, Marc Maron, and Betty Gilpin.\n\nGodless\n\nThe super-talented Scott Frank turned his pen to crafting this limited series Western, and it\u2019s one of the best genre pieces of the last few years. Jeff Daniels plays a great villain as Frank Griffin, the bad guy chasing his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Roy Goode, played by Jack O\u2019Connell. A great supporting cast includes Michelle Dockery, Scoot McNairy, and Merritt Wever \u2013 both Daniels and Wever won Emmys for their work here. If you even remotely like Westerns but haven\u2019t visited La Belle, you should correct that oversight.\n\nThe Good Place\n\nThe best comedy currently on network TV is this existential laugher about a woman who dies and goes to the titular location, but not everything is exactly as it seems. This is a show that works better in binge format than it does week to week as it\u2019s incredibly difficult to watch just one and it\u2019s really structured like one long film with the end of one episode often opening on the same scene in the next. The less you know about this great show\u2019s twists and turns, the better. Just trust us.\n\nGreat News\n\nThere\u2019s a whole subcategory of shows on Netflix that didn\u2019t get enough time to find an audience on network TV. Take for example this NBC comedy from executive producer Tina Fey, which is very much in keeping with her 30 Rock sense of humor. Briga Heelan is hysterical as a producer on a network news show who is forced to work with her mother, played by the great Andrea Martin. It has that razor-sharp wit of Fey\u2019s other NBC hit, but it never found the audience. Well, not yet.\n\nHalt and Catch Fire\n\nAudiences and awards-giving bodies never gave enough attention to AMC\u2019s brilliant show about the tech boom of the \u201880s. This is a program that deserves mention in the same breath as acknowledged AMC masterpieces like Breaking Bad and Mad Men. It\u2019s that good. It\u2019s about way more than just early computer programming. It\u2019s about competition, pride, and that feeling that most people have that they just might miss their one chance to make their dreams come true.\n\nThe Haunting of Hill House\n\nMike Flanagan\u2019s hit show is arguably Netflix\u2019s best current offering, a program that distilled its influential source material into something altogether new, terrifying, and heartbreaking. Quick, name a great horror TV show that\u2019s honestly scary. That\u2019s right, they don\u2019t really exist. Hill House was such a smash that they opened the checkbook to get Flanagan to return with The Haunting of Bly Manor. We can\u2019t wait either.\n\nHouse of Cards\n\nIt may have ended in a disastrous final season (and had some bumpy years before that), but the saga of Frank and Claire Underwood still demands a spot on this list for how impactful and watchable those first few years were. This was the first Netflix show that everyone was really talking about, and it changed the game. There\u2019s arguably no more influential program in the \u201810s if you consider how much Netflix now dominates the market. See where the sea change began.\n\nI Think You Should Leave\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of left-of-center humor like Mr. Show or the 12:55 p.m. SNL sketches written by Kyle Mooney, you owe it to yourself to watch one of the most-buzzed-about Netflix Originals of 2019, Tim Robinson and Zach Kanin\u2019s totally bizarre already-a-cult hit. How do you describe one of the weirdest comedy shows on Netflix? You really can\u2019t. Just watch it.\n\nThe Inbetweeners\n\nDo you like raunchy teen humor with a Brit bent? Don\u2019t sleep on this excellent coming-of-age sitcom that aired on E4 from 2008 to 2010 (before a spinoff movie and sequel). It\u2019s your standard teen-boy comedy \u2014 four guys trying to get by and get laid \u2014 but it\u2019s done with a good amount of heart and clever dialogue. It\u2019s the rare teen comedy that was both critically acclaimed and nominated by BAFTA for Best Situation Comedy each year it aired in the U.K.\n\nThe IT Crowd\n\nAs you can tell by now, there\u2019s a lot of good British comedy on Netflix, and this might be the best one that you haven\u2019t heard of yet. A cult hit about a put-upon IT group, this Brit comedy launched Chris O\u2019Dowd and Richard Ayoade, as well as a dozen or so GIFs that you probably use all the time and have no idea where they come from. (Five series available)\n\nThe Keepers\n\nThere is a lot of true crime material on Netflix waiting to fill your need to learn more about serial killers and unsolved mysteries. This is the best of the docuseries created by Netflix so far, a stunning, 7-episode piece on the murder of Sister Cathy Cesnik, whose death may have been a part of a cover-up of rampant sexual abuse by priests. You have to see this one.\n\nKen Burns Documentaries\n\nNo one makes documentaries like Ken Burns, and some of his best productions for PBS are available on Netflix. You\u2019re going to want to set aside some time for these, all of which are exhaustive, definitive documents of their subject. Burns doesn\u2019t just casually or superficially research his subjects \u2013 he devotes years of his life to them. Highlights on the service include The War, The Roosevelts: An Intimate History, The Civil War, Prohibition, The West, and The Vietnam War.\n\nThe Last O.G.\n\nJordan Peele created this wonderful vehicle for Tracy Morgan, a show that beautifully works off his comedy persona but also allows him new rhythms to play other than the ones he did on 30 Rock. Morgan plays an ex-con who has returned to his Brooklyn neighborhood to find that the city he grew up in is gone. Not only is the hood gentrified, but his ex-girlfriend (Tiffany Haddish) is with a new man.\n\n*Longmire\n\nThere are a ton of mystery-of-the-week series on Netflix, including hits like Criminal Minds and How to Get Away with Murder, but we\u2019ll suggest this Western-Crime hybrid that was canceled by A&E but then picked up by the streaming service, who produced three more original seasons. Robert Taylor is wonderful as the title character, an irascible Wyoming sheriff, and he\u2019s ably supported by Katee Sackhoff and Lou Diamond Phillips. People who love Longmire really love it. Find out if you\u2019re one of those people.\n\nMad Men\n\nIf someone were to write a piece on the most acclaimed shows of the current millennium, AMC\u2019s Mad Men would have to be included near the top. The winner of multiple Emmys, Matthew Weiner\u2019s drama is a masterpiece of tone and style, a document of the decline of an antiquated version of the working man in the \u201860s. TV doesn\u2019t get much better than Mad Men, a show that worked from its series premiere through to its series finale.\n\nMaking a Murderer\n\nFor many people, this is on the Mount Rushmore of true-crime docu-series. It certainly helped kick-start the current love affair people seem to have with crime stories on Netflix to the degree that they even returned for a second season (which you can mostly skip). The first season became such a phenomenon that the president himself had to weigh in on whether he would pardon Steven Avery. And the debate about his guilt or innocence rages still today.\n\nManiac\n\nCary Joji Fukunaga\u2019s trippy mindfuck is arguably the most divisive show on Netflix right now. Some people adore this Emma Stone and Jonah Hill journey into the recesses of insanity. Some people hate it. It\u2019s the kind of show that people were talking about at the end of last year, and there\u2019s some solid writing out there about its themes and reference points. Be a part of the conversation.\n\nMaster of None\n\nPersonal, creator-driven comedy has produced some of the best TV of the \u201810s, and this Aziz Ansari vehicle is a perfect example. His real-world controversy doesn\u2019t take away from the quality of these two seasons, which are insightful examinations of life as a twentysomething in the modern era. The second, Emmy-winning season is particularly masterful, as Ansari and his collaborators took the creative cache from year one and created something truly original and unforgettable.\n\nMindhunter\n\nJoe Penhall and David Fincher\u2019s loose adaptation of the story of the man who invented profiling serial killers is a tense, riveting drama with some of the best performances and visual language to date in a Netflix series. The first season saw the creation of the Behavioral Science Unit and interviews with real serial killers based on actual conversations. It\u2019s a fascinating, terrifying look at the darkness of which men are capable.\n\nMonty Python\u2019s Flying Circus\n\nIf this were a ranked list of the most influential shows you could watch on Netflix, this might be at the top. The men of Monty Python changed comedy forever when this show premiered a half-century ago on BBC. Since then, the most popular sketches in Python history have been played and replayed literally hundreds of times, influencing comedy forever with their wit, playfulness, and unique voice. There have been dozens of imitators, but there\u2019s only one Monty Python.\n\nMy Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman\n\nWhen David Letterman retired and grew the most impressive beard in TV history, everyone expected him to just enjoy his time off. Letterman couldn\u2019t stay away, and Netflix subscribers are happy about that. What\u2019s great about this interview series is how it allows Letterman to focus completely on one guest. The first year included Howard Stern, Barack Obama, and George Clooney, and the second season (launching May 31) includes Kanye West, Tiffany Haddish, and Ellen DeGeneres.\n\nNew Girl\n\nDoesn\u2019t it feel like if New Girl had aired a decade or two earlier, it would have been a massive hit? It was still popular enough to produce 146 episodes, and this is some of the best sitcom comfort food you can find on Netflix. Zooey Deschanel is great, but this show really became better when it developed into a true ensemble piece, including great supporting work by Max Greenfield, Lamorne Morris, Hannah Simone, and, especially, Jake Johnson.\n\nNurse Jackie\n\nIt\u2019s pretty cool how many Showtime shows you can find on Netflix \u2014 there are a grand total of zero HBO shows \u2014 from Dexter to Weeds. Don\u2019t forget this scathing dramedy anchored by yet another great performance from one of the best TV actresses of all time, Edie Falco. The former Carmela Soprano plays Jackie Peyton, an ER nurse who has some pretty serious problems of her own.\n\nThe Office\n\nBoth the U.K. and U.S. versions are on Netflix, so consider this an entry for both iterations of this great show. The British one that made Ricky Gervais a star is a masterful study of extremely awkward behavior whereas the U.S. version almost becomes like a family sitcom. It was on so long that we got to know and love the people of Dunder Mifflin, even if the show didn\u2019t exactly hold up for all nine seasons. It\u2019s still a surprisingly more consistent program than most of what\u2019s on the air today.\n\nOn My Block\n\nComing-of-age comedies don\u2019t get much more current than this 2018 offering, which has already aired two acclaimed seasons and been renewed for a third. What separates On My Block is cultural veracity, shining a spotlight on a diverse cast in a way that doesn\u2019t feel exploitative or cheap. It can sometimes slide into sitcomish writing, but the cast and crew find a way to make even the broadest jokes and plot twists resonate. This is one of the best shows you\u2019re probably not watching.\n\nOne Day at a Time\n\nSpeaking of cultural veracity, TV doesn\u2019t get much more inclusive than Norman Lear\u2019s brilliant reworking of one of his biggest hits from the \u201870s. The pitch is simple \u2014 reimagine the hit family sitcom with a Hispanic cast \u2014 but what makes this show so lovable is the cast and writing, which stays true to its character and the modern era while also feeling like a throwback to sitcoms we loved as kids. It\u2019s a true shame that Netflix canceled it after three seasons, although there are allegedly discussions to pick it up elsewhere.\n\nOrange Is the New Black\n\nIt\u2019s crazy how it seems like people don\u2019t really talk about one of the foundational shows of Netflix anymore. Believe it or not, young readers, there was a time when Netflix wasn\u2019t known for original programming and there were two shows that really changed that \u2014 House of Cards and OITNB. The latter is coming to a close with its seventh season this summer. See what all the buzz was about way back in 2013 and watch the entire run.\n\nOzark\n\nIt kind of feels like the in-house people at Netflix are building a Noah\u2019s Ark of every hit show from every other network. If it works somewhere else, expect an iteration of it here. And this hit drama is Netflix\u2019s Breaking Bad. Jason Bateman and Laura Linney star in a show about a family that jumps from the frying pan into the fire when they get caught up in the criminal underworld in the Ozarks.\n\nParenthood\n\nSometimes you want to be challenged by satire or an anti-hero \u2014 sometimes you just want a good family drama. This is for those latter times. Underrated when it aired \u2014 all family dramas are \u2014 Jason Katims\u2019s show based on the Ron Howard movie brings us into the lives of the Bravermans and their extended family and friends. People who love this show really love this show. Why not see if you\u2019re one of them?\n\nParks and Recreation\n\nIf The Office has a challenger in the department of best modern network workplace comedies it\u2019s this brilliant program, a show that took a few seasons to really find its groove but then never looked back. By season three, when Rob Lowe & Adam Scott are on the show and the writers have learned how to write for their amazing ensemble, this was one of the funniest shows on TV. We still miss it.\n\nPee-wee\u2019s Playhouse\n\nThere should be some kids stuff on here, right? Most of the family offerings on Netflix are pretty generic (even if the Captain Underpants show has its moments), so why not go back to an absolute classic? It\u2019s the twisted, inspired, loony adventures of the man-child known as Pee-Wee Herman. You can watch the 2016 revival movie Pee-Wee\u2019s Big Holiday when you\u2019re done binging the show that made him a household name.\n\nPenny Dreadful\n\nThis 2014 Showtime horror-drama never quite got national traction \u2014 which led to its cancellation after three years \u2014 but it has a loyal-enough following that it\u2019s actually returning in a spinoff called Penny Dreadful: City of Angels. The period piece includes a number of familiar names, including Dorian Gray, Mina Harker, Victor Frankenstein, Henry Jekyll, and even Count Dracula. It\u2019s a lot of fun, and Eva Green arguably should\u2019ve taken three Emmys for it.\n\nPlanet Earth\n\nWe should have some educational content on here too outside of Ken Burns, and this is one of the best documentaries ever made for television. Make sure your TV is fully calibrated for the best HD picture and start watching a show that\u2019s more than just a travelogue and more than just a nature program. It will seriously make you look at our planet in a new way, marveling at how much of it is truly beautiful.\n\nPortlandia\n\nIt\u2019s kind of amazing that Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein\u2019s edgy, left-of-center sense of humor had a home for eight seasons in this IFC hit. Now that\u2019s over, see what so many loyal fans fell in love with in all 77 episodes now on Netflix. Sketch comedy that often skewered the hipster culture of the northwestern United States, Portlandia is smart comedy with its own defiant, uncopiable voice.\n\n*Pose\n\nThe first season of FX\u2019s Emmy-nominated series has dropped on Netflix, and you really need to see what all the buzz is about. There\u2019s really no show quite like Ryan Murphy\u2019s blend of soap opera, fashion show, and character drama about gender-nonconforming culture in New York in the mid-\u201880s. It sometimes veers into excess, but that\u2019s also part of its undeniable charm, and it\u2019s always anchored by phenomenal performances, especially from Mj Rodriguez, Indya Moore, and the Emmy-nominated Billy Porter.\n\nRectify\n\nProbably the least-hyped and least-seen show on this list, this Sundance TV drama aired for four seasons. It\u2019s the best show you\u2019ve probably never watched. Aden Young stars as a man released from death row after 19 years behind bars for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. This gentle, complex character drama is more about the impact of something that tragic on a family and a community than a mystery, and it\u2019s easily one of the best dramas you could watch on Netflix.\n\nThe Returned\n\nFrench TV! Also known as Les Revenants, this is one of the best genre TV shows of the decade in any language. Based on a 2004 French film, this 2012 show has an irresistible hook \u2014 people who died years earlier suddenly return to the small French mountain town in which they lived. Why are they back? What does it mean? Tightly written and beautifully directed, this is one you\u2019ll down in a weekend.\n\nRiverdale\n\nYes, that Riverdale. Sometimes you just want to escape, and nothing right now provides the same wonderfully scripted escapism as this very modern update of Archie, Betty, Veronica, and Jughead. There is a lot of dark material on Netflix \u2014 you could spend days in their true crime section \u2014 and so it\u2019s nice to have something that doesn\u2019t tax the brain or strain the heartstrings. But don\u2019t get it twisted \u2014 Riverdale is not pure fluff. It\u2019s much smarter than you think. In many ways, it\u2019s an descendant of Twin Peaks in the way it subverts our expectations of what\u2019s going on behind the white picket fences. It\u2019s pretty great.\n\nRussian Doll\n\nThe first major hit of 2019 for Netflix already deserves placement on this list. It\u2019s the show everyone has been telling you to watch, the one that uses a Groundhog Day premise of a day lived over and over again to comment on trauma, isolation, and the modern midlife crisis. Natasha Lyonne plays a woman who keeps dying and reliving her 36th birthday party, and \u2026 well, that\u2019s all you need to know. This is one you\u2019ll probably do in a straight, 4-hour blast. And then you\u2019ll want to watch it again.\n\nSanta Clarita Diet\n\nVictor Fresco\u2019s pitch-black comedy just launched its third season, and the show\u2019s increasingly vocal and loyal fans were flabbergasted to learn it would be the last. Drew Barrymore stars as a California Realtor who, well, dies. She wakes up, though, and finds out that she has a craving for human flesh. Timothy Olyphant nearly steals the show as her put-upon-but-supportive husband. Somebody better pick this show up while Barrymore and Olyphant still have room in their schedules to do it.\n\nSchitt\u2019s Creek\n\nThis Canadian import took a season to find its rhythm, but it\u2019s basically brilliant from season two on. Created by Daniel Levy and his father, Eugene Levy, it tells the story of a rich family forced to relocate to a small town after losing their fortune. Both Levys are hysterical, and the show really became something special when it started sketching in the eccentric characters who make up the small town that gives it a title. It\u2019s one of the funniest shows of the decade.\n\nScream\n\nFile this under Guilty Pleasures. If you\u2019re looking for a way to turn off your mind and just enjoy a slasher TV show, you can do no better really than this MTV series that aired on the cable net in 2015 and 2016. There have been rumors of a rebooted third season in some state of production, but just bask in the silliness of beautiful people being killed in creative ways for the 24 episodes we have to date.\n\n*Sense8\n\nThe Wachowskis\u2019 Sense8 is precisely the kind of show that an ambitious streaming service like Netflix should be making more of, and certainly not cancelling after only two seasons. That\u2019s what happened to this show, a program that apparently cost too much money, but has an incredibly loyal following to this day. The concept barely hints at what this show is \u201cabout\u201d \u2013 eight strangers across the world suddenly become linked in inexplicable ways \u2014 as this program isn\u2019t quite like anything else on Netflix. Or any streaming service for that matter.\n\nSeven Seconds\n\nA sprawling look at corruption and grief, this 2018 limited series won Regina King a much-deserved Emmy for Best Actress in a Limited Series. One of the best TV actresses of the modern era plays the mother of a boy who is murdered in a hit-and-run by a Jersey City police officer. The writing doesn\u2019t always work, but the cast totally does, including King, Russell Hornsby, Beau Knapp, and Michael Mosley.\n\nSherlock\n\nThe BBC hit that made Benedict Cumberbatch a star and redefined the legend of Sherlock Holmes is just sitting there on Netflix waiting to occupy your weekend. More like a series of films each time they release a new installment than a traditional American TV season, this is smart mystery television with two magnetic performances from Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. You may notice a lot of Brit TV on this list \u2014 they do it well. (Four series available)\n\nThe Sinner\n\nJessica Biel does the best acting work of her career in the first season of this USA Network mystery series. She stars as an ordinary mother who snaps during a beach outing and stabs a man to death in front of dozens of people. It\u2019s not so much of a whodunit as a whydunit, and Biel is joined by great supporting turns from Bill Pullman as the cop who investigates the case and Christopher Abbott as her husband. A second season has aired (with Carrie Coon!) and a third is in production. This could be your new obsession.\n\nSkins\n\nOne of the most critically acclaimed British imports of the Peak TV era, this coming-of-age dramedy is notable for its fearlessness, often tackling issues that other shows avoid like the plague. It\u2019s also notable because the cast was replaced every two years, and the show\u2019s fans went with it, realizing that it was the writing that really matters here. However, you should know that Nicholas Hoult of Fury Road basically started his path to stardom with the first generation, as did Oscar nominee Dev Patel.\n\nThe Staircase\n\nSo much of the modern obsession with true-crime docu-series owes a great debt to this French examination of the death of Kathleen Peterson, such a hit that it was actually resurrected and expanded for the Netflix edition last year. In December 2001, Kathleen Peterson fell down a set of stairs and died. Well, that\u2019s what her husband said, but the police and prosecutors tried Michael Peterson for her murder. What\u2019s so captivating about The Staircase is that your opinion on his guilt or innocence will change roughly a dozen times.\n\nStar Trek\n\nDon\u2019t start yelling at us \u2014 we\u2019re not dumb enough to pick a favorite and so are just bundling all the current Star Trek offerings on Netflix into this one entry. The truth is you could spend DAYS watching just Star Trek episodes on Netflix. They have the original series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Enterprise. Why not watch em all and pick your favorite? We\u2019re too scared.\n\nStranger Things\n\nThe cult phenomenon that is Stranger Things has kind of diminished its critical appraisal. This is a really good show, more than a guilty pleasure and more than just a nostalgic nod to the \u201880s movies that inspired it (although it\u2019s those things too). Most of all, while WAY too many Netflix shows suffer from sags in the middle of their seasons (there\u2019s even a phrase for it \u2014 Netflix Bloat), both seasons of Stranger Things absolutely fly. This is how a genre show should be paced.\n\nSupernatural\n\nIsn\u2019t it kind of appropriate that a show about ghost hunters wouldn\u2019t die? Supernatural premiered way back when the CW was still the WB in 2005 and has been on the air for an amazing 14 seasons\u2014the upcoming 15th one will be the last adventure for Sam and Dean Winchester, two of fantasy television\u2019s most beloved characters. Supernatural has vacillated wildly in quality over its 300-plus episodes, but there are some true gems in here, especially for fans of urban legends and things that go bump in the night.\n\nThat \u201970s Show\n\nIf you\u2019re of the right age, one of your favorite shows from when you were a teenager is just sitting there on Netflix waiting for you to revisit it and see if it holds up. Return to Point Place, Wisconsin, and hang with Topher Grace, Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, and Laura Prepon in Eric Forman\u2019s basement.\n\nThe Twilight Zone\n\nOne of the best shows of all time is about to be rebooted again, this time by the one and only Jordan Peele. Why not catch up with Rod Serling\u2019s wildly influential and brilliant creation, a show that still works brilliantly more than a half-century after it first aired before you return to The Twilight Zone? This is the kind of TV that will never truly grow old, visions that tap into our greatest fears, anxieties, and needs. It was a masterpiece then and it\u2019s a masterpiece now.\n\nTwin Peaks\n\nThose of us old enough to remember when the mystery of who killed Laura Palmer dominated the cultural conversation will never forget it. There had never been anything like Twin Peaks on television and there wouldn\u2019t really be anything like it again until David Lynch returned to this world 25 years later. Sadly, the Showtime reboot isn\u2019t on here yet, but catch up with the original and mark the days until it is.\n\n*Unbelievable\n\nOne of the best original dramas in Netflix history stars Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart) as a woman raped in her own bedroom, and then called a liar by the investigating authorities. As we watch her life unravel, we see two brilliant detectives, played by Toni Collette and Merritt Wever, investigating crimes clearly committed by the same monster. It\u2019s a deeply empathetic series with phenomenal performances all across the board, especially from Wever.\n\nUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\n\nOne of the most acclaimed Netflix comedies of all time, this laugher stars Ellie Kemper as the title character, a woman released from the custody of a doomsday cult leader (played hysterically by Jon Hamm) and thrust into a ridiculous circle of friends in New York City. Carol Kane, Jane Krakowski, and Tituss Burgess take turns stealing focus in this broad, ridiculous, very funny show.\n\nThe Walking Dead\n\nThe Walking Dead helped redefine appointment television just when ratings were starting to erode to streaming services and DVRs. They became a massive hit because everyone had to watch it on Sunday night, largely so they wouldn\u2019t hear spoilers about a major character death. It doesn\u2019t quite have the fan base it once did, but it\u2019s still lumbering along on AMC and likely will be around in some form for many years to come. Eight seasons are on Netflix as of this writing.\n\nWeeds\n\nFor the first few seasons, Showtime\u2019s Weeds was one of the smartest comedies on television. Jenji Kohan\u2019s award-winning show stars Mary-Louise Parker as Nancy Botwin, a widow who has to resort to selling weed to make ends meet. The show really lost its way at some point, but those first few seasons are still gems, anchored by a great performance from Parker and supporting work by Elizabeth Perkins, Justin Kirk, and Romany Malco.\n\nThe West Wing\n\nRemember the days when dramas on TV could get political without Twitter tirades being an inevitable result? There\u2019s almost something quaint about the idealism of Aaron Sorkin\u2019s hit drama, now almost twenty years after it premiered. Come back, President Bartlet! We need you!\n\nWet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp & Eight Years Later\n\nIf you want a great example of a modern cult hit, look no further than 2001\u2019s Wet Hot American Summer,\n\na comedy that couldn\u2019t even crack $300,000 at the box office but went on to become such a hit \u2014 and see its ensemble become stars \u2014 that Netflix funded two spinoff series, a prequel and a sequel. Like the movie itself, both are pretty uneven, but both are also at times damn funny.\n\nWhen They See Us\n\nAva DuVernay directed Netflix\u2019s best mini-series to date in this searing, fearless look at the story of the Central Park Five, a quintet of young men of color who were forced into confessing to a crime they did not commit. DuVernay doesn\u2019t sugarcoat anything, showcasing a group of boys who were caught up in a racist, corrupt, vile system. Filled with stunning performances \u2014 especially Jharrel Jerome and Michael K. \u2014 it\u2019s the kind of artistic accomplishment that used to be exclusively the kind of thing that one would see only on HBO or maybe FX. It\u2019s further proof that Netflix is taking risks with artists, and that some of them are truly redefining the streaming landscape.\n\nWild Wild Country\n\nYou really must hear the story of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and Ma Anand Sheela and what happened to them in a small county in Oregon. Not your typical story of a cult gone awry, this Duplass Brothers production is captivating in the way it transports viewers to this little corner of the world and refuses to judge the people who fell under the Bhagwan\u2019s spell. And Sheela is one of the most fascinating real characters you\u2019ll ever meet.\n\nWormwood\n\nErrol Morris latest could technically qualify as a film but it was split up into episodes for its Netflix presentation, so we\u2019re calling it a TV show. The maestro of true crime documentaries takes an ambitious look at the death of Frank Olson, who may have been a part of a government testing program. It\u2019s trippy and fascinating. It may not be your typical true crime TV series, but it\u2019s an essential one.", "description": "The best TV shows on Netflix right now include The Office, Friends, Breaking Bad, American Crime Story, Mad Men, Frasier, Unbelievable, and more.
