REUTERS/Stephane Mahe\n\nOpinion polls show that Trudeau\u2019s party, in power since 2015, is locked in a tie with the opposition Conservatives and will lose its majority in the House of Commons.\n\nObama called Trudeau a hard-working, effective leader who tackled big issues like climate change.\n\n\u201cThe world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbours to the north support him for another term,\u201d he said in a tweet.\n\nThe two men formed a close friendship when Obama, a Democrat, was still in office. Trudeau was the first Canadian prime minister the United States honoured with a state dinner in almost two decades when Obama invited him and his wife to Washington in March 2016 after Trudeau won power the previous October.\n\nObama\u2019s endorsement came just hours after Trudeau, speaking to reporters in Montreal, accused the Conservatives of running \u201cone of the dirtiest, nastiest campaigns based on disinformation that we\u2019ve ever seen in this country.\u201d\n\nA Nanos Research overnight poll for CTV and the Globe and Mail newspaper put the Conservatives at 32.5%, the Liberals at 31.9% and the left-leaning New Democrats (NDP) at 18.8%. Canadians vote on Monday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trudeau, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer and NDP chief Jagmeet Singh were all stumping for votes in Quebec, a predominantly French-speaking province that is a key political battleground, home to 78 of the 338 seats up for grabs.\n\nScheer said last week that Trudeau was \u201ca phoney and a fraud\u201d who did not deserve to govern. Scheer has repeatedly said Trudeau will raise taxes immediately after the election - which Trudeau has denied.\n\nThe Conservatives were the source of a video of Trudeau in blackface in the early 1990s. They gave it to Global News to authenticate and it emerged a day after the first blackface picture was published by Time magazine.\n\nTrudeau targeted his Conservative counterpart near the end of the nearly six-week official campaign period, which has been characterized by mudslinging on both sides.\n\n\u201cWe may wake up Tuesday morning and have a government led by Andrew Scheer. And the only way to avoid that is to vote for the Liberal Party,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\nFor his part, Scheer has had to deal with repeated references by Trudeau to his personal anti-abortion stance, even though the Conservative leader has said he will not limit a woman\u2019s right to choose.\n\n\u201cJustin Trudeau has been dividing Canadians - pitting regions of our great country against each other,\u201d Simon Jefferies, a spokesman for Scheer\u2019s campaign, said in a statement, adding Trudeau \u201cshould take a look in the mirror.\u201d", "description": "Canadian Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, facing a tough election next week, accused his rivals on Wednesday of fighting a dirty campaign and picked up an endorsement from former U.S. President Barack Obama.", "authors": ["Kelsey Johnson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441574124&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1PB", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
