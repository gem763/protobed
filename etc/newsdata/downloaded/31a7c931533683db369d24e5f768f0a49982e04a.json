I was born this way!\u201d\n\nLater that same day, the Rocklin teacher selected and read \u201cRed: A Crayon\u2019s story,\u201d a book about a crayon struggling with an identity crisis, according to a letter from the public charter school, which is part of the Rocklin Academy Family of Schools. The books are geared to children ages 4 to 8.\n\nExplore where you live. Subscribe for 12 FREE weeks of unlimited digital access.

The issue has become so heated that the district hired a public relations firm to help handle the fallout.\n\nSocial media posts have shown heated opposition to the story-time choice. Stories on local news stations, conservative web sites and press releases from family values organizations quoted parents who said the school threw a coming-out party that culminated with a boy coming out of the bathroom in girl\u2019s clothing.\n\nSchool officials say there was no such reveal. The child had been transitioning slowly during the school year and had already been wearing girl\u2019s clothes, said Jillayne Antoon, who was principal at the school and has since been promoted to director of growth and community engagement for the Rocklin Academy Family of Schools.\n\nThe girl did go to the bathroom later in the day and changed into a dress, but then quietly returned to the classroom, Antoon said. She said the children had all brought extra clothes to school that day in anticipation of water play at recess, although that didn\u2019t end up taking place.\n\n\u201cA couple of girls complimented her on her dress,\u201d Antoon said. \u201cWe were so proud of how the kids can handle this in a way that clearly the adults are having a hard time with.\u201d\n\nUpset parents whose children told them about the story called Karen England of Capitol Resource Institute, a conservative advocacy group based in Nevada. England has a long track record of opposing changes supported by the LGBT community. It fought same-sex marriage and a state law (AB1266) that permits transgender students to join athletic teams and use bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identities instead of their sex.\n\nEngland said the school neglected parental rights when the teacher read the book to the children. \u201cNo parents were previously notified that this discussion would take place,\u201d according to a press release from the organization.\n\nEngland told The Bee that parents opposing the teacher\u2019s reading of the book would not talk on the record. Attempts to contact parents who commented on social media were unsuccessful.\n\n\u201cThe average parent doesn\u2019t want to have this conversation in kindergarten, and it was forced upon them,\u201d England said.\n\nRobin Stout, executive director of Rocklin Academy Family of Schools, said a large number of the families in the school system have supported the teacher. The family of the student who brought the book to school declined to comment.\n\nParent Ankur Dhawan had a 5-year-old daughter in the kindergarten class. He doesn\u2019t have a problem with the book.\n\n\u201cThis is a topic that is very pertinent to our times,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I wanted to have this discussion with my child I don\u2019t know of a mechanism that would work out better then this. The timing isn\u2019t what I chose, but it is a decent way to bring it up.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for children as young as kindergarten to transition to another gender, according to officials from Sacramento-area school districts.\n\nJazz Jennings, the subject and co-author of \u201cI am Jazz,\u201d has been in the media spotlight since 2004, when at age 4 she was diagnosed with gender identity disorder. Since then she has appeared on numerous television programs, starred in a reality series and is a spokeswoman for LGBT rights.\n\n\u201cOur understanding is that most of us have a solid sense of our gender identity by the time we are 3 or 4 years old,\u201d said Nichole Wofford a social worker at the Connect Center at Sacramento City Unified School District, which offers support services to all students, including transgender kids.\n\nWofford said that the two books read by the Rocklin teacher are commonly known by people who are working with transgender youth and are about gender identity, not about sex or sexuality.\n\nGender socialization happens very young, agreed Swati Rao, a clinical psychiatrist at UC Davis Children\u2019s Hospital and doctor at the Gender Health Center in downtown Sacramento. \u201cGender identity is your internal idea of what gender you are, whether you are male or female or neither,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a completely separate issue from who you find attractive.\u201d\n\nHow schools discuss transgender issues with students is governed by state law, including the Fair Education Act, passed in 2011. The law requires that the contributions of minority groups, the disabled and the LGBT community be included in educational textbooks in public schools.\n\nThe School Success and Opportunity Act (AB1266), passed in 2013, allows transgender students to participate in sports and use facilities consistent with their gender identity. It also prevents schools from revealing the identity of students who are transgender and requires them to use the name and pronoun consistent with the student\u2019s gender identity.\n\nWhen a child transitions at a Sacramento City Unified, the Connect Center offers support and guidance to the child, family and staff, Wofford said. The district notes the child\u2019s preferred name and gender in the school database.\n\nSan Juan Unified uses a handbook called \u201cSchools in Transition\u201d and has offered workshops for transgender students, staff and families through the Gender Health Center in Sacramento. There also are resources online at Gender Spectrum, said Kate Hazarian, San Juan Unified\u2019s director of Family Engagement and Partnership Development.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t focus on teaching about transgender youth, we focus on tolerance, treating each other with respect and kindness,\u201d Hazarian said.\n\nIt\u2019s usually parents who are most anxious about the topic of transgender children, she said. \u201cMy experience is that kids are a lot more tolerant than adults.\u201d\n\nSome Rocklin Academy parents are pushing the school to exclude certain books, allow parents to opt children out of reading specific books or offer prior notice to parents about which books will be read in class.\n\nTheir concerns prompted the school to review its literary policy over the summer, Stout said. District officials decided that the books that were read to the children were within the policy and did not require prior parental approval, Stout announced that conclusion in the Aug. 15 letter to parents.\n\nParents can only opt their children out of sex education, which does not include discussion on gender, sexual orientation or family life, according to the California Education Code.\n\n\u201cThe board and I feel any policy amendments would require a great deal of thoughtful conversation with all the stakeholders,\u201d Stout wrote in her letter to parents. \u201cThere is, of course, the possibility of creating a slippery slope about what can and cannot be discussed in our classroom.\u201d\n\nThe school\u2019s policy is in accordance with other public K-12 schools in California, she wrote.\n\nThat response did not satisfy England and other critics.\n\n\u201cWhile the law may allow them to have those books in the school, there is nothing that mandates they do it,\u201d England said. \u201cThese children belong to the parents and not to the Rocklin Academy. They shouldn\u2019t have it forced upon them by the school. This is a controversial issue that has no place in the classroom.\u201d\n\nA board meeting last week was emotional on both sides. The teacher at the heart of the controversy offered tearful testimony, while upset parents talked about parental rights and confused children who are afraid they will change gender, according to a CBS 13 news report.\n\nWith controversy still raging, the book will also be on the agenda for the Sept. 18 board meeting, according to school officials.\n\nRao, the UC Davis psychiatrist, said fears that children will change their own gender identities because of peers who do so are unfounded.\n\n\u201cThere is actually no evidence to show that being exposed to these issues early on makes children any more likely to become LGBT,\u201d said Rao. \u201cHiding information about LGBT folks doesn\u2019t make kids any less likely to figure out they are LGBT in the future.\u201d\n\nShe said it is common for all children to do some cross gender play. Children who are persistent and continue to insist they are the other gender than assigned at birth are those who are most likely to be transgender, Rao said.", "description": "A group of angry parents at Rocklin Academy in Rocklin, Calif., have rallied family rights activists to protest a kindergarten story time that featured a book about a transgender child.", "authors": ["Michael Tarm", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/5502557042001/abf16b47-bcfa-44ad-8bf6-c4e4c9d59004/3869102b-f6e6-4e38-86b2-7a17c9f03a69/1280x720/match/image.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
