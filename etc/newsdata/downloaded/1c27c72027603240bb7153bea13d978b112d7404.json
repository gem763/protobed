Seven years later, there is another cyclist surnamed Lee hoping to repeat history: 18-year-old Ceci Lee Sze-wing.\n\nSince becoming a junior member of the Hong Kong cycling team in 2015, Ceci has been singled out as a star in the making.\n\nShe already has an impressive track record: two gold and two silver medals at the 2019 Asian Junior Track Cycling Championships in January, and a silver and bronze at the 2nd National Youth Games in August.\n\nOlympic rowing vs coastal rowing: This Hong Kong junior team member has mastered both\n\nBut as she tells Young Post, her biggest achievement to date is her third-place finish in the Women\u2019s Elite Omnium at the 2019 Japan Track Cup two months ago; it was her first time standing on a podium alongside senior athletes.\n\n\u201cThere were so many top cyclists in the competition,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a confidence boost, because I\u2019ve been trying to transition from the junior category to the senior one as seamlessly as possible.\u201d\n\nCeci feels she\u2019s already on a par with other Asian cyclists, but she\u2019ll have to wait for her debut in the upcoming UCI Track Cycling World Cup to see where she stands on a global stage.\n\nUpon joining the cycling team, Ceci Lee Sze-wing quickly emerged as a supernova with her remarkable results in Asian junior events.

She began her sporting career as a triathlete, and of the three disciplines involved \u2013 running, swimming, and cycling \u2013 riding a bicycle was where she fell short. Her family decided to enrol her in the Cycling Association of Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cStars of Tomorrow\u201d programme, hoping it would help Ceci brush up on her skills, thereby improving her overall performance.\n\nBut as Ceci spent more time on the wheels, she became drawn to the high speed and power of the sport. She eventually gave up triathlons to focus on her new-found passion.\n\n\u201cI felt like cycling suited me more. I really liked the speed of it, and its unpredictability. Every cyclist has a unique style, and everyone has a chance at winning a race,\u201d she says.\n\nMulti-sport athlete Alyssa Ho of King George V School can beat you at squash. And hockey. And probably long-distance running too\n\nSprinting has always been Ceci\u2019s speciality, but she admits that now she\u2019s competing in senior races, she can\u2019t rely on speed alone. She explains that her strategy is too passive \u2013 she often finds herself waiting for her opponents to speed up, then trails after them. Instead, her coach wants to her to step up and take the lead.\n\n\u201cNow that I will no longer be the fastest, I know I have to try other strategies. I need to create more opportunities for myself, rather than waiting for them to happen,\u201d the Lam Tai Fai College student says.\n\nCyclists in the senior category are not only faster and more powerful, but more aggressive, and crashes occur all the time. Ceci was involved in a serious pile-up while competing in Beijing back in August.\n\nCeci is still recovering from an eye injury she sustained from a crash in Beijing several months ago.

Her left eye was badly bruised, so much so that she couldn\u2019t open it the next day.\n\n\u201cIt was the scariest crash I\u2019ve ever been in; I was so lucky to be okay,\u201d she recalls. \u201cMy parents were worried sick, because I only came back to Hong Kong for two days, then I went to another competition in Russia.\u201d\n\nTo avoid losing her nerve like this again, Ceci goes through an unusual pre-race ritual: she gives her bike a kiss for luck. This quick peck on the top of the bicycle frame gives her confidence in both herself and her vehicle.\n\nKovac Veljko didn't know where Hong Kong was until two years ago: now he's helping lead City University to victory\n\n\u201cI know this may not sound very hygienic, but I do it because I treat the bike like my partner. I cannot achieve anything without it,\u201d she says.\n\nWith her sights set on conquering the world of senior cycling, Ceci will have a chance to prove herself when she competes at the 2020 Asian Track Championship in South Korea next October.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t know which events I will take part in, but my goal is to finish in the top five.\u201d\n\nEdited by Charlotte Ames-Ettridge", "description": "Following in the footsteps of Olympic medal winner Sarah Lee, Ceci Lee Sze-wing already has an impressive track record in Asia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/62803f6a-ebf6-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4imagehires130529.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
