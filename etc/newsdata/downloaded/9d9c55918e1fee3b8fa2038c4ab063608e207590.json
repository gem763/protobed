The former chair was forced to step down as premier of the North West in May following weeks of violent protests throughout the province as residents and ANC members rallied behind the \u201cSupra must fall\u201d campaign.\n\nHis province was also placed under administration, amid numerous allegations of corruption and a health system that had completely collapsed.\n\nWhen asked if he was part of a group trying to discredit the work being done within the party since Ramaphosa\u2019s ascendency, Masibi said they were not interested in entertaining those who held those views.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important is that we want justice to prevail, it cannot be that people are borrowed power to administer the politics of the ANC at a national level and all they do is to reward the Nasrec triumphant,\u201d said Masibi.\n\n\u201cAll of us are members of the ANC, we are paying R12, all of us, there is no super member that pays more than R12,\u201d he added.\n\nMasibi said although he felt it was pointless seeking an internal solution for this current challenge, the matter would be raised when the ANC goes to its national general council, which is due in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe are still going to go for the [national general council], we believe such matters will form part of the process, we believe that ultimately, internally, we have to find some mechanisms and remedy,\u201d said Masibi.\n\nHe added that national executive committee members needed to remember that their decisions would come under review when the party goes to conference to review its policies and the state of the organisation.\n\n\u201cPeople must go and account for their actions because we would have made representations internally, where we were cautioning and warning the leadership, saying \u2019this is not the right decision\u2019. So heads must roll come [national general council]. We want accountability on decisions that have been taken,\u201d he concluded. \u2013 News24", "description": "Angry ANC members from the North West, who are challenging the party\u2019s decision to disband its provincial executive committee, have expressed confidence ahead of their legal clash with the party this morning.", "authors": ["Staff Reporter"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8172/0d175a8924bc414eaf96fbc648cd510d.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-09"}
