The gunman, whom the Odessa Police Department identified as Seth Aaron Ator, 36, was also killed in a shootout.\n\nThe shooting occurred between Odessa and Midland after a routine traffic stop turned violent around 3 p.m. local time Saturday. The gunman, who was only identified in the news conference as a white male in his mid-30s and driving a gold-colored car, began firing at officers and sped away.\n\nChief Michael Gerke of the Odessa Police Department described it as \"a different type of active shooter\" given that the gunman was firing along the highway.\n\nHere's what we know now:\n\nWhat happened during the shooting?\n\nPolice say the gunman grabbed a rifle and fired several shots at two Texas Department of Public Safety officers, wounding one, during the traffic stop on Interstate 20.\n\nThe shooter then fled westbound on the interstate toward Odessa, continuing his violence along the way and firing at other motorists and passers-by.\n\nAt one point, police say the suspect stole a mail truck. He also shot an officer from the Odessa police department and the Midland police department.\n\nThe rampage ended in a Cinergy movie theater in Odessa as officers cornered the assailant and fatally shot him. Cellphone video from the scene showed the chaos and gunfire outside the building.\n\nGerke said they were processing more than 15 crime scenes from the shooter's path.\n\n'They're shooting right there': Eyewitness video shows Odessa, Midland, Texas shooting\n\nWho are the victims?\n\nPolice have not released the names of the seven people confirmed dead nor the 22 wounded.\n\nGerke said the deceased ranged in age from 15 to 57. \"My heart aches for all of them,\" Gerke said.\n\nThe shooter killed mail carrier Mary Granados, 29, while hijacking her delivery van, according to a statement from the U.S. Postal Service. Army veteran Kameron Brown was also gunned down in the rampage, his employer Standard Safety & Supply confirmed in a statement.\n\nRodolfo \u201cRudy\u201d Arco, 57, died instantly after a bullet pierced his truck's window, his sister Maria Arco told The Arizona Republic. The entrepreneur had moved to Odessa after the Las Vegas shooting, hoping it would be safer, Arco said.\n\n'Best and worst of humanity': Odessa and neighboring Midland vow to heal\n\nOthers killed include Joseph Griffith, 40, and Edwin Peregrino, 25, according to family members interviewed by The Washington Post.\n\nHigh school student Leilah Hernandez also died, her grandmother Nora Leyva told the Post, after the gunman fatally shot her just months after her quincea\u00f1era. The Ector County Independent School District lamented the loss.\n\n\"We are heartbroken and outraged by the violence that struck our community and our school district today,\" the district said in a statement. \"We are learning that we have lost friends, family members, as well as one of our students. Our lives have been changed forever.\"\n\nRest easy mamas I will always love you baby sis it\u2019s sad it had to happen to you I wish I would of been me you still had your whole life ahead of you.

Daniel Munoz, 28, also suffered glass cuts in his shoulder after the shooter fired at his car.\n\nA 17-month-old baby girl initially taken to Medical Center Hospital was transported to UMC Health System in Lubbock, Texas, about 140 miles away. The child had shrapnel in her chest, a hole in her lower lip and her front teeth knocked out, a GoFundMe for the child said.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott said the mother of the child texted him that her daughter was to have surgery Monday.\n\n\"This is all of our worst nightmare, but thank god she's alive and relatively well,\" the mother said in a text that Abbott read at a news conference. \"Toddlers are funny because they can get shot but still want to run around and play.\"", "description": "The shooting occurred between Odessa and Midland, Texas, after a routine traffic stop turned violent around 3 p.m. local time Saturday.", "authors": ["Ryan W.
