After Sunday\u2019s 33-7 loss to the New England Patriots, running back Chris Thompson got emotional and started crying when talking about the possibility of Gruden\u2019s firing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating, of course,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s tough to think about with that situation. I really care about Jay.\u201d\n\nChris Thompson broke into tears when discussing Gruden after the game pic.twitter.com/rlsUNHTl0U \u2014 Matthew Paras (@Matthew_Paras) October 6, 2019\n\nBut as Thompson\u2019s tears seemed to imply, players felt this was coming after Washington\u2019s 0-5 start.\n\nESPN reporters Dianna Russini and Josina Anderson said unidentified Redskins players generally felt this was inevitable. The players Anderson talked to, however, appeared to blame Gruden for a culture of laziness at practice.\n\nRedskins player to me on coaching change: \u201cIt was time. Too much laziness & stubborn *%#@ going on around here. Folks not taking #@$! serious. Looking at snap chat during practice, come on now. You know who I\u2019m talking about. Guys were talking about it. We\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d \u2014 ig: josinaanderson (@JosinaAnderson) October 7, 2019\n\nAnother #Skins player checks in: \u201cGruden is a good dude, but you can tell he saw the writing on the wall though. Players like him, it just got a little too laid back here lately & sometimes that can bite you in the butt. I\u2019ve seen some things here I\u2019ve never seen on other teams.\u201d \u2014 ig: josinaanderson (@JosinaAnderson) October 7, 2019\n\nA starter told Russini: \u201cIf they think (firing Gruden) will make us better this season, it won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nReaching out to Redskins players over text and they all knew this was coming. One starter said \u201cif they think this will make us better this season, it won\u2019t\u201d Another added \u201csomeone had to take the blame\u201d #Redskins \u2014 Dianna (@diannaESPN) October 7, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
