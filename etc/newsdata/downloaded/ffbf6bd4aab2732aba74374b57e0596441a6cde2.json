Flights had also restarted.\n\nBut NHK reported the swamping of a maintenance yard for the Hokuriku bullet train which connects Tokyo with Nagano. Ten trains were damaged when water levels rose by an estimated four metres, NHK said, citing the train operator.\n\nThe storm brought havoc to the sporting world, forcing the delay of Japanese Grand Prix qualifiers and the cancellation of three Rugby World Cup matches.\n\nBut a crucial decider pitting Japan against Scotland went ahead, leaving the hosts with a stunning 28-21 win they dedicated to the disaster victims.\n\n\"To everyone that's suffering from the typhoon, this game was for you guys,\" said Japan's captain Michael Leitch.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [TOKYO] Fresh rain threatened to hamper efforts by tens of thousands of Japanese rescuers searching for survivors after a powerful typhoon that by early Tuesday had killed 58 people. .
