We have not yet disclosed our main sources of power and what they have seen and we have used so far is a small part of our capacities,\u201d the major general said.\n\nAlso in September Salami said Iran\u2019s enemies quake in fear at Tehran\u2019s military power, claiming \u201cwe are so powerful that they are forced to falsely accuse us to be behind any incident.\u201d", "description": "Iran\u2019s top Revolutionary Guards Corps commander, Major General Hossein Salami, claimed Tehran had \u201cdefeated\u201d the U.S. military.", "authors": ["Simon Kent"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/IRGC-leader-general-salami-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
