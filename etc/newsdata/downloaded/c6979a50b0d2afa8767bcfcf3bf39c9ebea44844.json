In recent weeks, the president had grown angry with Mulvaney over media coverage of the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, which has overcome White House defiance to obtain damaging testimony from several officials.\n\nAD\n\nPublicly, the White House continued to stand by Mulvaney, a sign that he is likely to survive, at least for the moment.\n\n\u201cMick Mulvaney\u2019s standing in the White House has not changed,\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Friday.\n\nAD\n\nWhite House spokesman Judd Deere added, \u201cHe is still the acting chief of staff and has the president\u2019s confidence.\u201d\n\nPrivately, the opinion inside the White House toward Mulvaney\u2019s news conference was almost universally negative, according to current and former administration officials, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.\n\nFor hours after the news conference, in which Mulvaney appeared to contradict Trump\u2019s denials of a quid pro quo linking political investigations to Ukrainian aid, White House officials worked to clean up his comments. Trump, who watched Mulvaney\u2019s event on Air Force One while flying to Dallas, spoke to Mulvaney by phone about his follow-up statement, officials said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhite House officials said they were taken aback by Mulvaney\u2019s comments in the briefing room. Speaking off the cuff, Mulvaney told reporters that Trump had intervened to block nearly $400 million in aid in part because he wanted Ukrainian officials to investigate a conspiracy theory that Ukraine was involved in election interference in 2016, something U.S. intelligence officials have repeatedly attributed to Russia.\n\n\u201cDid [Trump] also mention to me in the past the corruption related to the DNC server?\u201d he said. \u201cAbsolutely, no question about that. But that\u2019s it, and that\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d\n\nHe punctuated his remarks with bravado, saying detractors should \u201cget over it\u201d because political influence in foreign policy was appropriate.\n\nAD\n\nMulvaney reversed course in his written statement, saying that \u201cthere was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut the walk-back did little to contain the damage caused by the televised comments, which sparked a wave of condemnation from Democrats and many of Trump\u2019s Republican allies. Sean Hannity, a Fox News host who speaks regularly with the president, called Mulvaney \u201cdumb\u201d and his comments \u201cidiotic\u201d during his radio show Thursday.\n\nRep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.) said Friday he was \u201cshocked\u201d by Mulvaney\u2019s televised admission, which contradicted Trump\u2019s previous denials.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d he told reporters Friday. \u201cWhen the president has said many times there wasn\u2019t a quid pro quo . . . and now Mick Mulvaney goes up and says: Yeah, it was all part of the whole plan!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRooney said he was \u201cstill thinking about\u201d backing Trump\u2019s impeachment, adding that he was unconvinced by some of the arguments coming out of the White House.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has no immediate choices to replace Mulvaney and was said to not be as frustrated as others in the White House, many of whom have expressed dismay about the lack of an organized impeachment response effort.\n\nLeon E. Panetta, who served as chief of staff under President Bill Clinton, said Mulvaney\u2019s news conference was \u201cbizarre\u201d and called into question his stewardship of the White House during the impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cThe appearance is that they are totally disorganized,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no message, there\u2019s no clear defense to these allegations, and you can sense that when Mulvaney basically says \u2018That\u2019s the way it is\u2019 without really presenting any rational position that could defend what the president is accused of.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut Trump has reveled in the lack of structure and appreciates a chief of staff who allows him to \u201cdo whatever he wants,\u201d one former administration official said. It is one of the reasons Trump is not looking to fire Mulvaney, even though the men do not have the close personal rapport that Trump has with some other aides, the official said.\n\nAD\n\nFor example, when Trump decided recently to pull U.S. troops from Syria, Mulvaney did not attempt to block the move, as previous chief of staff John F. Kelly had done.\n\nAnd with Trump complaining that so many people are turning on him, he is reluctant to dump anyone else from his team, aides said.\n\nMulvaney\u2019s standing as chief of staff has always been precarious, underscored by the fact that the word \u201cacting\u201d remains in his title 10 months after he took the position.\n\nAD\n\nTrump did not initially want to name Mulvaney as chief of staff, an administration official said. The former budget director was \u201cleft holding the bag\u201d when Trump\u2019s first choice \u2014 Vice President Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Nick Ayers \u2014 decided not to take the job, the official said.\n\nMulvaney\u2019s tenure has been somewhat rocky of late. Administration officials have lamented about a White House communications shop that had essentially become the president\u2019s defiant tweets, and a legislative affairs shop that was rowing uphill to push legislation amid impeachment.\n\nAD\n\nThursday\u2019s briefing quickly went off track after Mulvaney took questions unrelated to Trump\u2019s decision to host the 2020 G-7 at his Trump National Doral Miami golf resort.\n\nA prep session held in Mulvaney\u2019s office ahead of the news conference with White House lawyers and press staff, as well as State Department officials, focused mostly on G-7 questions, according to two officials familiar with the meeting.\n\nOn the other topics that came up, Mulvaney had prepared none of his answers in advance and was just \u201cwinging it,\u201d according to a senior administration official.\n\nTrump has complained in recent weeks that not enough advisers are on TV, with Grisham largely staying away from the cameras and White House aide Kellyanne Conway appearing sporadically. White House officials recently ordered Mark T. Esper, the defense secretary, to go on Sunday morning shows, according to a White House official, after Trump was so frustrated with the Syria coverage.\n\nMulvaney is expected to appear on Fox News this Sunday, an official said.\n\nMatt Zapotosky contributed to this report.", "description": "Republican lawmakers and officials said the White House chief of staff did more to harm the president\u2019s defense than administration officials testifying before Democratic-led committees in Congress.", "authors": ["Toluse Olorunnipa", "White House Reporter", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EdO-43g60qZtOAFHF400_YEflWM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EXWENVXR2AI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
