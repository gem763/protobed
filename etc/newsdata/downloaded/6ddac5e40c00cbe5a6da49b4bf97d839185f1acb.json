Then he was 'turned away'", "language": "en", "text": "A US diplomat overseeing the previous administration's Ukraine policy reportedly told House investigators he was \"turned away\" by a staffer to then-Vice President Joe Biden after sharing concerns about his son's work in the country.\n\nGeorge Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, said that he approached an aide to Mr Biden in early 2015 with concerns about Hunter Biden\u2019s position on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, according to the Washington Post.\n\nHe reportedly warned that Ukrainian officials might believe they could use the younger Biden for currying influence with the vice president.\n\nThree people familiar with his testimony told the outlet that Mr Kent was concerned the issue would undermine efforts by US diplomats working with Ukraine to root out corruption and conflicts of interest within its own government.\n\nBut Mr Kent was turned away by one of the vice president\u2019s staffers \u2014 who he reportedly declined to name during his testimony on Tuesday.\n\nHe said the staffer told him Mr Biden did not have the \u201cbandwidth\u201d to focus on the issue of his son working for the Ukrainian energy firm as his other son, Beau Biden, was battling cancer.\n\nSpeaking on the condition of anonymity, a former senior national security aide to Mr Biden told the outlet the former vice president\u2019s son had \u201cno substantive impact\u201d on the administration\u2019s Ukraine agenda.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand what the optics thing means other than someone thinking it looked bad in a political way,\u201d the aide told Washington Post. \u201cDid it have any effect on US policies, either on what we were doing or what the Ukrainians were doing? It didn\u2019t\u2026. In the aggregate it didn\u2019t have any discernible effect.\u201d\n\nThere has been no evidence to show illegal actions or any criminal wrongdoing on either part of the Bidens. Still, their involvement in Ukraine has become the subject of attacks by Donald Trump and his allies in Washington who are currently embroiled in their own Ukrainian scandal.\n\nThe House launched an impeachment inquiry into Mr Trump after a whistleblower alleged he abused his power in a 25 July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nA memorandum the White House released of the phone call showed Mr Trump asking Mr Zelensky for a \u201cfavour\u201d before urging him to launch an investigation into the Bidens, as well as the origins of the 2016 probe into Russian meddling in the US election. Mr Trump has long espoused unfounded claims that Ukraine was behind election interference rather than Russia.\n\nThe whistleblower also alleged military financial aid had been withheld just days before the call. Mr Trump has denied those claims and said there was \"no quid pro quo\" in his \"perfect call\" with Ukraine.\n\nAndrew Bates, a spokesperson for the vice president\u2019s campaign, said in response to Washington Post\u2019s reporting that the younger Biden's position on the board of Burisma did not factor into the administration's policy surrounding Ukraine.\n\n\u201cOn Joe Biden\u2019s watch, the US made eradicating corruption a centrepiece of our policies toward Ukraine,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more\n\nOsama bin Laden raid architect: US \u2018Republic is under attack\u2019 by Trump", "description": "A US diplomat overseeing the previous administration's Ukraine policy reportedly told House investigators he was \"turned away\" by a staffer to then-Vice President Joe Biden after sharing concerns about his son's work in the country.George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state,", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wafbdfDwtyt4RBnZW6HOag--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/20b90a5b360135fe5e17d6175d6dc541", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
