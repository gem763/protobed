Meaning in my mind.\u201d\n\nNext month, Aniston returns to the medium that made her into a household name and an international star (with box-office hits such as 2011\u2019s \u201cHorrible Bosses\u201d and 2013\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019re the Millers\u201d). In the Apple TV Plus drama \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d she plays a veteran anchor, Alex Levy, who finds herself in the spotlight after her famous male colleague, Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell), is fired over sexual misconduct allegations. Aniston is an executive producer on the series along with Reese Witherspoon (who plays Bradley Jackson, a local newswoman who takes over the newly vacated co-anchor chair).\n\nMore from Variety\n\nThe original pilot for \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d which focused on the cutthroat world of morning TV, was completely re-written after Matt Lauer was fired from \u201cToday\u201d in November 2017. And while Carell\u2019s Kessler, the disgraced anchor on \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d bears some eerie resemblances to Lauer, Aniston insists that the show is a work of fiction.\n\nPeggy Sirota for Variety\n\nStill, she studied old episodes of \u201cToday\u201d and \u201cGMA\u201d to find rhythms of her character, and she spent time grilling Diane Sawyer, Willie Geist and Gayle King about their early-morning routines. She even re-watched \u201cToday\u201d on the day before Lauer was fired. \u201cDid he know? Did he not know?\u201d Aniston asks. She felt disgust at the news of his abusive conduct. \u201cI was so devastated,\u201d Aniston says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a strange thing; it felt oddly like my dad did something terrible. I trusted him and had been interviewed by him. He was there for so many moments in my life. And when \u2018Friends\u2019 was ending, it was Katie [Couric] and Matt interviewing us.\u201d\n\nFor this week\u2019s Power of Women issue (where Aniston is honored for her philanthropy with St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital), the actress spoke to Variety about her new TV role, the legacy of \u201cFriends\u201d and the one time that Harvey Weinstein tried to bully her.\n\nWhat was it like producing \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d before the Me Too became a national movement?\n\nThe show got picked up. We sold it to Apple with an outline. Then, about four months later, the whole s\u2014 hit the fan and, basically, we had to start from scratch.\n\nDid that change your process for building the character?\n\nI work with this wonderful [acting coach] named Nancy Banks. We read. We think about her. We think about what her physicality is. Here was the big kicker for me. [Nancy] would take me places that I was not sure I wanted to go emotionally. So if I was bumping up against something, she would say, \u201cWell how does this feel\u2026\u201d Almost like therapy. I also lost having a life, because Sundays were always spent with Nancy for four or five hours, going over the week\u2019s work.\n\nBecause it was shot like a movie?\n\nA series of movies out of order and the most dense material.\n\nWere all the episodes done out of order?\n\nMost of them were. We\u2019d shoot this and then we\u2019d say, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll throw in some of Episode 104.\u201d And while we\u2019re adding a scene from 107, you have to go, \u201cWhere was I and where will I have gone by then?\u201d\n\n\u201cFriends\u201d must have been so different.\n\n\u201cFriends\u201d was like going to see a play for three or four hours. And it was just laughing and wonderful fun. And this is fun. It\u2019s just a lot harder. My bandwidth had to expand so that I could take in all the information.\n\nI know you spent some time with Diane Sawyer. What other journalists did you model Alex on?\n\nAll of them.\n\nDid you watch \u201cToday\u201d episodes when Katie Couric was on?\n\nI actually watched those live when I was growing up. But yeah, it was very interesting. I went to the DVR that I had of \u201cToday\u201d before Matt Lauer was fired and then the day he was fired, because that was so fascinating to see. Mitch Kessler is not based on him at all. He\u2019s just sort of the archetype of all of the men that he\u2019s representing.", "description": "It\u2019s been 15 years since Jennifer Aniston signed off as Rachel Green on \u201cFriends.\u201d In that time, she\u2019s received plenty of other offers to star in a TV show, but she hadn\u2019t been tempted by any of them. \u201cI was doing so many films at the time,\u201d Aniston says on a recent afternoon, sitting in [\u2026]", "authors": ["Ramin Setoodeh"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tMTQZKTt5KBR6U42d.GGdA--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/variety.com/026db3d5ae3a75a42d5811925048bfcf", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
