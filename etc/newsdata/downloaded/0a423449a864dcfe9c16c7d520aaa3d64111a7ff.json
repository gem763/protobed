I mean, FFS.'\n\nBut his post was ridiculed by Dan Walker, who said he was picking on Meghan Markle because she didn't want to go for a second drink with Mr Morgan.\n\nThe Good Morning Britain star (right) clashed with the BBC's Dan Walker on Twitter over Meghan Markle\n\nIn a tweet today Piers Morgan criticised Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, accusing them of making their trip to Africa 'all about their own terrible struggle'\n\nDan Walker immediately responded in a quote tweet, and accused Mr Morgan of picking on Meghan Markle\n\nBut Mr Morgan didn't take the jibe lying down and accused Mr Walker of being dull and tedious\n\nMr Walker took Piers worded and turned them around in a follow up tweet in the spat\n\nMr Morgan said he was not bullying anyone, but criticising a publicly-funded member of the Royal Family\n\nIn a tweet Mr Walker said: 'Imagine being given a TV show & a newspaper column & using them both to pick on a woman who didn't want to go out for a second drink with you.'\n\nBut Mr Morgan quickly retorted: 'Imagine being the dullest, most excruciatingly virtue-signalling, tediously opinion-devoid, toe-curlingly snivelling sycophant on TV?\n\nps For the record, I never asked Meghan for a drink, she asked me.'\n\nThe incident quickly turned into a Twitter spat, with Mr Walker then jokingly asking if Piers was around for a drink later.\n\nHe responded: 'Sure if you can afford to fly to Beverly Hills.'\n\nMr Morgan also bragged that he had '6.2 million more followers' than Mr Walker.\n\nMr Morgan has been tweeting a lot about the documentary that aired on Sunday in which Ms Markle admitted becoming a mother while living under an intense media spotlight has been a 'struggle'\n\nThe two traded a number of barbs on Twitter after Dan Walker accused Mr Morgan of picking on Meghan Markle\n\nDan Walker was surprised that Piers had not yet started to compare the amount of Twitter followers each of them have\n\nMr Morgan then took this opportunity to prove he had a lot more people following him\n\nMr Morgan has been tweeting a lot about the documentary that aired on Sunday in which Ms Markle admitted becoming a mother while living under an intense media spotlight has been a 'struggle'.\n\nSpeaking to ITV during the couple's recent tour of southern Africa, she said that: 'Not many people have asked if I'm OK'.\n\n'Look, any woman - especially when they are pregnant - you're really vulnerable and so that was made really challenging, and then when you have a new born - you know?' she said, when asked how she was coping.\n\n'And especially as a woman, it's a lot.\n\nShe added: 'And also, thank you for asking, because not many people have asked if I'm OK. But it's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.'\n\nAsked if it would be fair to say it had 'really been a struggle', Meghan said: 'Yes.'\n\nMr Morgan has been tweeting about the royal couple ever since the documentary aired on Sunday\n\nMr Moran questions the royal couple's complaint about being treated unfairly by the media\n\nThe Good Morning Britain host also thinks the interview was a distraction and 'shockingly selfish & tone deaf'\n\nIn reference to the royal couple he said: 'This endless woe-is-me nonsense from two of the most privileged people in the world is absurd.'\n\nMr Morgan congratulates the ITV journalist for his scoop but asks why the two royal brothers have fallen out\n\nIn one tweet Mr Morgan said: 'Zero press/TV headlines about their charity work today.\n\n'Nor any about William & Kate's very successful but now completely overshadowed tour.\n\n'It's all about Meghan & Harry's terrible ordeal 'existing' in lavish royal splendour at our expense. Shockingly selfish & tone deaf.'\n\nAnd in another, responding to someone who accused him of racism he said: 'Many thanks for your kind thoughts Gina.\n\n'I have no issue with Meghan based on her ethnicity, and have never written any racist dogwhistling pieces about her or anybody else.\n\n'I just found her to be a social climbing fake & always take people as I find them.'", "description": "The Good Morning Britain star has been a vociferous critic of the royal couple ever since they complained about their treatment by the media on an ITV documentary that aired on Sunday.", "authors": ["Joe Middleton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/14/20036558-0-image-a-94_1571750585374.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
