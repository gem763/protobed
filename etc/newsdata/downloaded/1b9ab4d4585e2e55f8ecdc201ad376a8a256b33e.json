(AP) \u2014 A new state law in California lets local governments form their own banks to handle taxpayer money.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday that he signed a law co-authored by Assemblymen David Chiu of San Francisco and Miguel Santiago of Los Angeles.\n\nThey argued that because public banks don\u2019t have to worry about shareholder profits, they can invest in things commercial banks are reluctant to provide, including affordable housing and infrastructure.\n\nBut they warned the approval process will be rigorous. Local governments would need a business plan and state-approved insurance. The law only allows for 10 public banks in the state, with no more than two licenses issued each year.\n\nThe law takes effect Jan. 1.\n\nThe California Bankers Association said public banks would be unfair competition for community banks.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A new state law in California lets local governments form their own banks to handle taxpayer money.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2018/12/02/california_legislature_22487_c0-329-4847-3155_s1770x1032.jpg?ac528a59d08cea317b63f163b73443e6a8b4beca"}
