The nod from the Federal Aviation Administration paves the way for UPS to scale up operations as it competes with FedEx Corp. , Amazon.com Inc. and others vying to develop drone delivery services in the U.S.\n\nThe company said medical supplies are particularly well suited to drone delivery because products such as blood and medical specimens are light and tend to be of uniform size. Such items require faster turnaround times and offer higher margins than delivery segments such as e-commerce.\n\n\u201cIt is a premium move,\u201d said Dan Gagnon, UPS\u2019s vice president of health-care logistics, marketing and strategy. \u201cWe\u2019re talking perishable products and important results.\u201d\n\nUPS began delivering medical supplies via unmanned drones in March at the Raleigh, N.C., campus of health-care provider WakeMed Health & Hospitals. Drones have cut delivery times at the WakeMed facility to three minutes, Mr. Gagnon said, compared with about 19 minutes or longer for products delivered through road courier networks, which often involve multiple stops.\n\nIt plans to roll out a similar service at the University of Utah Health campus in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe project with CVS would help UPS\u2019s drone unit expand from business-to-business moves into consumer deliveries, company officials said.\n\nThe parcel carrier is also planning a drone logistics project with Kaiser Permanente to examine how drones can help move supplies between buildings at the health-care provider\u2019s 39-hospital network.\n\nUPS is working with drug distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp. on plans to deliver some pharmaceuticals, supplies and records from its warehouses to its hospital customers by drone. \u201cThe No. 1 targeted operating model is from their facilities to campuses,\u201d Mr. Gagnon said. \u201cOnce you have established landing pads and have an intra-hospital network, it\u2019s a very easy incremental step.\u201d\n\nLast week FedEx and Alphabet Inc. \u2019s Wing aviation spinoff launched a trial using Wing drones to ferry packages to homes in Christiansburg, Va., in what the companies said was the first scheduled commercial residential drone delivery service in the U.S. Residents participating in the trial can also order health and wellness products from the Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. pharmacy chain, FedEx said.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com", "description": "United Parcel Service is striking a series of drone-delivery agreements with health-care groups as it develops new technology pitched to the growing medical market.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith", "Jennifer.Smith Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-112513/social", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
