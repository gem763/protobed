Even if you're playing solo, you might still want to share highlights of your game with friends by posting video clips of your favorite moments to social media. Luckily, the PS4 has video recording features built in for just this sort of thing.\n\nNot only can you start recording to capture gameplay that's about to begin, but the PS4 is always recording the last 15 minutes of gaming, so it's easy to save a great moment that just happened.\n\nCheck out the products mentioned in this article:\n\nHow to record gameplay on the PS4\n\nRecording gameplay couldn't be simpler.\n\nWhen you're within a game and ready to begin recording, double-press the Share button on the controller. Your PS4 will immediately start recording (a small flag will briefly appear on the left side of the screen to let you know), and will continue to record for its default recording time (which is 15 minutes, but you can change that), or until you stop recording manually.\n\nWhen you double-press the Share button, you'll see a flag on the side of the screen that indicates you've started recording. Dave Johnson/Business Insider\n\nIf you want to stop recording before the default time period is over, double-press the Share button a second time. The video clip will be automatically saved in the Capture Gallery.\n\nHow to save the last 15 minutes of gameplay\n\nIf you weren't recording but want to save video of something that just happened in a game, you're in luck. Like a TiVo that's always recording in the background, your PS4 is always capturing the last 15 minutes of gameplay, just in case you decide you want it.\n\nTo save the video, briefly press the Share button. In the Share menu, select \"Save Video Clip.\"\n\nOpen the Share menu and choose Save Video Clip to save the last 15 minutes of game video.

If you want more precise control over your video, select the menu that says \"10 Second Intervals\" and choose a smaller number, such as five seconds or even one second.\n\nIf 10-second intervals aren't precise enough, you can adjust the start and end points in as little as one-second intervals. Dave Johnson/Business Insider\n\n5. Use the D-pad on the controller to scroll to where you want the video to start and then select that point. Choose \"Start Here\" from the menu.\n\nFind the point where you want the video to begin, and choose \"Start Here.\" Dave Johnson/Business Insider\n\n6.

From the PS4's Home screen, briefly press the Share button.\n\n2.
