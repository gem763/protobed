These makeshift \"video clubs\" -- usually made up of a diesel generator, a VCR and a TV or projector loaded onto a truck -- would travel around the country showcasing Hollywood and Bollywood blockbusters, as well as West African films.\n\nTo attract viewers, the video clubs needed to advertise their offerings. But they did not have the original movie posters, or the means to print alternatives -- the country's military rulers had even restricted the import of printing presses.\n\nSo they made their own, commissioning local artists to hand-paint them on used flour sacks. They were large, usually 40 to 50 inches in width, and 55 to 70 inches in height.\n\nThe posters have since made ripples in the art world, with early originals commanding high prices from collectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 12 A movie poster for \"Predator,\" painted by artist Stoger for Royal Gate Video Club in Ashaiman, a town near Accra.

Some of the most popular artists -- or their pseudonyms -- included Joe Mensah, Nyen Kumah, Leonardo, Socrates, Death is Wonder, Frank Armah and D.A. Jasper.\n\nBrian Chankin began collecting the posters about 10 years ago, just as global interest started building around them. He displayed them on the wall of a video store he owned in Chicago.\n\n\"People started wanting to buy them off the wall, so we ended up selling quite a few,\" he said. \"I was able to gain a little following with them, so I started buying more and more with any money I had. Over the years, hundreds and hundreds of posters have come through my hands, and many of them I keep for my collection.\n\n\"There's some that would go for well into the thousands if I decided to sell them, but those are the ones I am certainly not interested in selling. I know that other people have sold these posters for upwards of $50,000. Anything from the 1980s is just incredibly scarce and incredibly hard to find at this point.\"\n\nBrian Chankin with artist Leonardo.

Since then, many artists have quit the trade, Chankin said. But some have kept the tradition alive and are now working on commission, either making copies of original posters or painting entirely new ones of both old and new movies.\n\nIn 2015, Chankin opened Deadly Prey Gallery , a Chicago-based studio that works with Ghanaian artists. Prices for commissioned posters vary from $300 to $600, and the most requested are from the big 1980s action blockbusters that made the posters famous. \"Predator, Terminator, anything with Kurt Russell, anything with (Jean-Claude) Van Damme,\" said Chankin, adding: \"Horror is arguably the most popular genre.\"\n\nWith interest seemingly on the rise, the posters are now easy to find on online. But, Chankin warned, buyers should beware of modern copies masquerading as old originals.\n\n\"There are always bootlegs -- they usually try to make the posters look older than they actually are,\" he said. \"Those ones I could spot in a second, but other people might not be able to.\"", "description": "Originally produced to advertise local screenings, these hand-painted movie posters from Ghana are now sought after by art collectors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191004124125-rambo---eric-sojay---600---hi-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
