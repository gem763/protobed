It was confirmed to the Guardian by sources familiar with Tuesday\u2019s events, who stressed that at no point did Rouhani show interest in such a conversation with Macron and Trump.\n\nIn a desperate bid to engineer a three-way conversation, Macron had French technicians set up a line last Tuesday evening in a meeting room at the Millenium Hotel, across the road from the UN general assembly.\n\nRouhani was informed that as soon as he entered the room the conversation could start.\n\nFor months, Macron has been promoting a plan aimed at defusing tensions in the Persian Gulf, exchanging US sanctions relief for full Iranian compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal and Tehran\u2019s agreement to pursue broader talks.\n\nTrump, however, has been ratcheting up sanctions in recent weeks and announced more punitive measures in his speech to the UN earlier the same day Macron wanted Rouhani to talk to him.\n\nIran\u2019s economy has been hard hit by a US oil and banking embargo, and diplomatic sources in New York said it was never remotely likely Rouhani would speak to Trump without sanctions relief.\n\nThe Iranian president spoke by phone to Barack Obama at the UN in 2013 without the prior consent of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and was heavily criticised after returning home.\n\nRouhani said on Monday that a return was possible to multilateral talks established at the time of the 2015 nuclear deal, that would include the US as part of a group of six major powers known as the P5+1.\n\nAccording to the Entekhab news site, Rouhani said \u201cthere was some readiness created for the P5+1\u201d and that \u201call 7 countries [Iran and the US] reached agreement over the P5+1 framework\u201d.\n\nRouhani said he would reveal more details at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.\n\nIranian officials said that any direct contacts with the US would only be possible after sanctions imposed by the US over the past year are removed.", "description": "Iranian leader did not, at any point, show interest in a conversation despite the French president setting up a secure phone line", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d309edaaa5315f34e2dd36497c9b426e0b5bf210/0_52_4015_2410/master/4015.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1d948478e1cf499fdd29bb67f7eba9d6", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
