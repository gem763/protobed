President trump saying do us a favor. Later bringing up Joe Biden and saying we've done a lot for Ukraine. Nancy Pelosi saying the president's actions gave congress no choice but to investigate. And what did attorney general William Barr know? And late today, Mike Pompeo was subpoenaed to produce documents. What did he know about the president's wishes? And the controversial figure president trump met with. Mary Bruce leading us off from the hill. Reporter: Tonight, the tentacles of this crisis are spreading. Questions about who in the white house spoke with the whistle-blower. What did bill Barr know? And tonight, the state department under the microscope. House Democrats issuing a subpoena to Mike Pompeo. Asking for documents related to Ukraine, and involving Rudy Giuliani. He is mentioned 31 times in the whistle-blower complaint, saying they were deeply concerned about his circumvention of national security decision making processes. The whistle-blower claims he was told state department officials spoke to Giuliani, tying to contain the damage to national security. Those ambassadors sought to help Ukrainian officials respond from the differing messages they were receiving. Giuliani says the state department asked him to participate. I've uncovered information that the swamp has been covering up for years. And the statement department asked me to do this. To the best of my knowledge, each of the actions that were undertaken by statement department officials was entirely appropriate and consistent with creating a better relationship between the United States and Ukraine. Reporter: Tonight, an overwhelming majority of Democrats support the impeachment inquiry. Pelosi saying it's squarely focused on the president's actions regarding Ukraine. The president of the united States used taxpayer dollars to shake down the leader of another country. I do think the attorney general has gone rogue. He has for a long time now. Reporter: Republicans still largely behind the president. But not rushing to defend his actions. I don't have any comment, thank y'all. Reporter: Former Republican senator Jeff flake says dozens of his former colleagues want the president impeached. Somebody mentioned yesterday, if there were a private vote, there would be 30 Republican votes. That's not true. It's 35, or maybe more if it were a private vote. Mary, house Democrats making it clear they do not want this to drag out. They want to move quickly. But what does that mean? Give us a timeline. Reporter: The revelations in the whistle-blower complaint have super charged the investigation. Committee leaders are making it clear they'll work straight through the break, and they're mapping out hearings, subpoenas, some are saying they want a vote before the end of the year on impeachment. Mary, thank you.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "Lawmakers want documents related to Ukraine, including communication involving the president\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/WNT/190927_wn_bruce1_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
