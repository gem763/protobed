Prior to the show, rap had existed in China only in underground circles; it had become mainstream overnight. But its ascendance to the realm of pop culture would have dire consequences for freedom of speech in the country.\n\nA year later, as Rap of China headed into its second season, the Chinese government imposed widespread restrictions on the country\u2019s nascent rap scene. It blacklisted 150 rappers. References to hip-hop culture were banned from appearing in all media sources, including television and movies. Although the laws governing the censorship were left deliberately vague, they were strictly enforced. Artists \u201cwhose heart and morality are not aligned with the party and whose morality is not noble,\u201d the Communist Party said, were no longer able to perform in public.\n\n\"In China, you never know exactly what is forbidden,\u201d says a Chinese rapper in David Verbeek\u2019s short documentary Trapped in the City of a Thousand Mountains. \u201cThat\u2019s actually a very clever tactic. It makes everyone more careful. Without a clear boundary, people will be more prone to self-censor.\"\n\nThe atmospheric film follows a group of Chinese rappers through the streets of Chongqing, one of China\u2019s largest cities, as they discuss life in the surveillance state as marginalized musicians. Verbeek, who lived in China for 12 years, tapped his network to find subjects for the film. Some of the musicians who appear in the film, such as \u201cMister Da,\u201d have been forced to abandon their music as a result of the new regulations. Others, like \u201cGhostism,\u201d continue to use the genre as a platform for fomenting dissent.\u201cWherever there is repression / There will be rebellion,\u201d he raps.\n\nThe film\u2019s cinematography is ominous\u2014shot mostly in the shadows of the night, flashes of neon lights intermittently puncturing the darkness, as if evoking the role of the artist in the resistance.\n\n\u201cThe essence of hip-hop is to be a critical voice that empowers communities,\u201d Verbeek told me. Now, however, \u201cthe role hip-hop plays in China is marginal, because it is castrated.\u201d\n\nAccording to Verbeek, censorship, digital espionage, and surveillance have had a widespread impact on Chinese youth. The situation \u201chas numbed people\u2019s brains to critical thought, and has, ironically, turned them into the perfect consumers for Western materialism,\u201d he said. \u201cBut despite all the brainwashing, the Chinese remain soulful people, full of character and spirit. Their openness and generosity will always continue to surprise me\u2014it\u2019s in direct contrast to their government.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina doesn\u2019t have freedom,\u201d says one musician who appears in the film. \u201cThat\u2019s real talk.\u201d\n\nHis friend gets the last word: \u201cYou better stop talking now.\u201d", "description": "The underground rap scene in China actively subverts censorship.", "authors": ["Emily Buder"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/video/img/2019/10/Chinese_Rappers_V_3/video-featured.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
