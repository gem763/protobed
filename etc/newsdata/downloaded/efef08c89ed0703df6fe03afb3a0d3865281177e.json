Your man had that marquee event did he?\" \u2014 a reference to his own landmark crossover boxing rules bout against Floyd Mayweather in 2017.\n\nMcGregor then tried to ridicule Nurmagomedov's last fight, his UFC 242 victory over Dustin Poirier in Abu Dhabi last month. \"More like an event in a marquee.
