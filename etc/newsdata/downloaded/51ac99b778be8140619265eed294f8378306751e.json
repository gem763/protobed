Apple shares fell 7 percent in the 60 days following last year\u2019s event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany analysts expect Apple to keep its pricing the same as last year even though tariffs on products made in China are set to go into effect on Dec. 15.\n\n\u201cWe suspect that Apple will likely maintain current iPhone prices on its 3 new models ($749/$999/$1099), and may keep memory and storage content the same as last year \u2013 despite dramatic cost declines \u2013 providing margin cushion to help offset potential tariffs or required promotional activity,\u201d wrote Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi from New York.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade war is an issue that has been front and center for Apple investors. In July, Trump turned down a request from Cook asking for the tech giant to be shielded from the tariffs. The president told the company to make its products in the U.S. to avoid the tariffs.\n\nIn August, Cook dined with Trump to discuss in further detail the negative impact the tariffs will have on his company, specifically how South Korean rival Samsung doesn't have to pay the tariffs. Trump thought Cook made a good point and said he would reconsider.\n\nDespite the potential tariff headwind, Wall Street is mostly postive on Apple. Ahead of the event, they have an average price target of $223 a share, according to an IBES survey.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cWe view this week's launch as putting fuel in Apple's growth tank which is much needed as Cupertino navigates mature secular smartphone headwinds which are being exacerbated by the US/China high stakes tariff poker game,\u201d wrote Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives, who has a $245 price target \u2013 more than 14 percent above where shares closed on Monday.", "description": "Apple's stock has typically responded in a positive way to new iPhones.", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/06/0/0/AP19154667712260.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
