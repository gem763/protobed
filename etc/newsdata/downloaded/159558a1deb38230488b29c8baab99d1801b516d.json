The goal is typically to create a reorganized, often smaller company that can get a new start.\n\nAccording to a recent Bloomberg story, Forever 21 hired a team of advisers to help restructure its debt and has been in talks for additional financing, but negotiations with possible lenders have stalled.\n\nThere has been a wave of recent bankruptcies and store closing announcements.\n\nNine months into 2019, there have already been 40% more store closings announced than in all of 2018, according to a new report from global marketing research firm Coresight Research.\n\nBased on Coresight Research's figures, retailers' earnings reports, bankruptcy filings and other records, more than 8,200 stores are slated to shutter this year and thousands of locations already gone.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kelly Tyko on Twitter: @KellyTyko\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Forever 21 bankruptcy 2019: Retailer says not planning to file Sunday", "description": "Forever 21 Inc. said the company is not planning to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Sunday, refuting some reports.", "authors": ["Kelly Tyko", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/E493212tyeuGxaU7FWlWSQ--~B/aD0yNzQ0O3c9MzY2MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_money_325/4a61f64bc37141dc525a99cd4541a773", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
