Khan is due to begin working for UBS on Tuesday.\n\nThe Credit Suisse contractor killed himself on Tuesday, Thomas Fingerhurth, the lawyer for security firm Investigo, reportedly said.\n\nThe bank's statement said Bouee had ordered its head of global security to observe Iqbal Khan, and he had done so in \"in order to protect the interests of the bank,\" and did not discuss it with the rest of the board.\n\nThe statement also said that there was no \"indication that the CEO had approved the observation of Iqbal Khan nor that he was aware of it prior to September 18, 2019, after the observation had been aborted.\"\n\nThe bank also said it found no \"evidence that Iqbal Khan had attempted to poach employees or clients away from Credit Suisse, contrary to his contractual obligations.\"\n\nBouee, who was one of CEO Tidjane Thiam's closest allies at the bank, will be replaced by James Walker, who prior to this was CFO of some of Credit Suisse's US subsidiaries and head of product control. \"", "description": "Credit Suisse announced on its website this morning that its COO, Pierre-Olivier Bouee, would be resigning from the post effective immediately over his ro...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d9315de2e22af2f870f74f2-2400/rtx2dlp8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
