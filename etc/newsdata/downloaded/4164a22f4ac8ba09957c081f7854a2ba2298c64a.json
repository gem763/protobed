Success is seen as unlikely at this point as few Republican senators have criticized Trump.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday found that 43% of U.S. adults believe Trump should be impeached, and 42% said he should not be impeached. Another 14% said they were not sure.\n\nKent, who has spent much of his career fighting corruption in Ukraine and elsewhere, is the second career diplomat to testify as part of the probe after being subpoenaed. The White House and State Department had ordered them not to appear.\n\nHis testimony backed up accounts from other U.S. government insiders who have said they were unnerved by Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\nDIPLOMATS TESTIFY\n\nMarie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, on Friday accused the Trump administration in testimony of recalling her in May based on false claims.\n\nKent also said that a top White House official, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, picked the officials who would handle Ukraine policy after the sitting ambassador was abruptly recalled in May.\n\n\"Here is a senior State Department official responsible for six countries, one of which is Ukraine, who found himself outside of a parallel process that he felt was undermining 28 years of U.S. policy in promoting the rule of law in Ukraine. And that was wrong. He used that word, 'wrong',\" Connolly said of Kent.\n\nTwo of those officials, U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Kurt Volker, a special representative for Ukraine, worked with Giuliani to pressure Ukrainian officials to launch investigations that could benefit Trump, according to communications provided to the committee.\n\nVolker resigned his post in late September. Sondland is due to testify later in the week in response to a congressional subpoena.\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry was the third official named to handle Ukraine relations, Kent told the committee. Congressional investigators subpoenaed Perry last week.\n\nLawmakers on Monday heard from Fiona Hill, Trump's former Russia adviser, who said she and her then-boss, former national security adviser John Bolton, were also alarmed by the effort.\n\nHill told lawmakers that Bolton characterized Giuliani as \"a hand grenade who is going to blow everybody up,\" according to two sources familiar with her testimony. A Bolton spokeswoman said he would have no comment on the testimony.\n\nGiuliani had faced a Tuesday deadline to produce the requested documents. His lawyer, Jon Sale, said the documents were protected by legal principles that shield attorney-client communications and presidential communications.", "description": "U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said on Tuesday they will not cooperate with a U.S. House of Representatives impeachment inquiry, prompting a leading Democrat to say that would strengthen the case against the president.
