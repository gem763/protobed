On social media, she maintains a lively relationship with her thousands of fans, posting personal moments with her husband, two young children and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.\n\nBut her post on Thursday was even more personal than usual: It explained that she\u2019d been off the air recently due to her diagnosis with a rare gynecologic cancer.\n\n\u201cWhat I had was called a molar pregnancy. It\u2019s a pregnancy that is not viable \u2014 meaning a fetus never formed \u2014 but instead of miscarrying, the pregnancy continued to grow and produced invasive tissue,\u201d Velez shared on both Facebook and Instagram, in a long post alongside a photo of her mother hugging her after her first day of chemo. \u201cIn some very rare cases that tissue can turn into cancer and spread to other organs in the body. That is what happened to me. No good reason. Just unfortunate dumb luck.\u201d\n\nVelez continued that the \u201cgreat news\u201d is that the cancer is treatable, but that \u201cthe bad news is I have to go through aggressive chemo to kill it.\u201d\n\nHer news was met with an outpouring of support, including 1,000 reactions and more than 480 comments on Facebook alone, some from people who had also withstood cancer treatments and wanted Velez to \u201cstay strong,\u201d \u201crest\u201d and \u201ckeep that positive attitude.\u201d\n\nSo, what exactly is Velez dealing with, and how rare is it?\n\nA molar pregnancy, also known as hydatidiform mole, occurs in only one of every 1,000 to 1,200 U.S. pregnancies. It\u2019s a type of Gestational Trophoblastic Disease (GTD), notes Harvard Medical School\u2019s Harvard Health Publishing, explaining, \u201cAfter a sperm fertilizes an egg, new tissues develop that normally form the fetus and placenta,\u201d but that molar pregnancy occurs \u201cwhen the tissue that was supposed to form the placenta grows abnormally and can form a tumor that can spread beyond the womb or uterus.\u201d\n\nIn a \"complete mole,\" the entry continues, \u201cno normal fetal tissue forms. In a \u2018partial mole,\u2019 incomplete fetal tissues develop alongside molar tissue. These two conditions are noncancerous (benign) and make up 80 percent of cases.\u201d\n\nThe other 20 percent of molar pregnancies are malignant, or cancerous, like Velez\u2019s, and involve the spreading of the molar tissue either locally, within the uterus, or distantly (called metastases).\n\nThere are also two other types of GTD, explains the website of the New England Trophoblastic Disease Center at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center: Choriocarcinoma, affecting only one in every 20,000 to 40,000 pregnancies, is highly malignant, and can originate from either a molar pregnancy or from tissue that remains behind after miscarriage or childbirth. Placental-site and epithelioid trophoblastic tumors, meanwhile, are even rarer forms of GTD, arising in the uterus at the site where the placenta was attached.\n\n\u201cMolar pregnancies I\u2019ll probably see once every year or two,\u201d Amelia Jernigan, MD, a gynecologic oncologist with LSU Health New Orleans and a communications liaison with the Foundation for Women\u2019s Cancer, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. She\u2019s only ever seen one choriocarcinoma, and underscores how rare these diseases are in general.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten better at identifying these early and we follow it closely,\u201d Jernigan adds. \u201cSo, while it\u2019s scary, if we can identity it and treat it, people can do OK.\u201d Getting an ultrasound in early pregnancy is an important step, she says, because, doctors \u201care going to be able to tell something\u2019s wrong most of the time on an ultrasound.\u201d And after a miscarriage, \u201cthat tissue goes to the lab and gets evaluated. If the lab report comes back and says \u2018partial mole\u2019 or \u2018complete mole,\u2019 someone\u2019s going to be watching you more closely.\u201d\n\nDepending on a specific set of factors known as a woman\u2019s risk score, she explains \u2014 which is taken into account here more than the traditional cancer staging system when making treatment plans \u2014 chemo can consist of either one drug or a taxing regimen of five.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t hit these really hard up front, they can come back and stop responding to chemo and then become extremely hard to treat,\u201d Jernigan notes. \u201cBut the general rule is they are almost always curable if treated appropriately up front.\u201d", "description": "Las Vegas news anchor Michelle Velez left fans reeling when she posted on Facebook that she\u2019d been diagnosed with a rare cancer, caused by an abnormal, or molar, pregnancy.
