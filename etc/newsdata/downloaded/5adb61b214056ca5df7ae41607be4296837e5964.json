The video showed the girl leaving the club in jovial spirits and she stayed in front of the club showing no signs of drink spiking or sickness.\u201d\n\nMany Facebook users quickly pointed out that Scott was attempting to refute Smith\u2019s claims once again.\n\nREAD MORE Rapture Nightclub Owner Doubles Down On Fucked Comments About Drink Spiking Incident\n\nScott continues: \u201cThis was not a letter about drink spiking, it was a take down of the nightclub we have worked so hard to make the best we could\u2026 I got upset and sent a terse reply, calling her out in a sarcastic and demeaning way, which I regret. It was beneath my dignity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sorry. I should have swallowed my disbelief and not let emotion rule my head.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nightclub has a good reputation for great music and lighting, excellent service, cleanliness and great staff. It employs 15 to 20 people and I made a mistake. Sorry.\u201d\n\nCheck out the full apology below, which seems like more of a Rapture redemption post rather than sincere concern about Smith and her safety.\n\nThe post was removed a couple of hours later after being overrun by punters poking holes in the apology.", "description": "Rapture nightclub owner\u00a0Neil Scott posted - and subsequently deleted - an apology on the club's Facebook page, which continues to refute the spiking claims.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/nightclub-owner-apology.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
