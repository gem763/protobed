Now we have the list of six Booker Prize shortlisted authors, the bets are on.\n\nThe Booker Prize is one of the greatest literary triumphs for any novelist. Former winners Margaret Atwood and Salman Rushdie are the biggest names on this year\u2019s shortlist, vying for the \u00a350,000 prize.\n\nIt is awarded annually to the best novel of the year, written in English and published in the UK or Ireland, between 1 October 2018 and 30 September 2019.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

This year\u2019s winner will be announced on 14 October.\n\nTo make it onto the shortlist is no mean feat, considering it is whittled down from 151 submitted books. Women are leading the way this year, with four female authors in the running \u2013 Atwood, Lucy Ellmann, Bernardine Evaristo and Elif Shafak, who are competing for the prize with two male authors, Rushdie and Chigozie Obioma, who is shortlisted for the second time with his second novel, An Orchestra of Minorities.\n\nHigh-profile books on the longlist that didn\u2019t make it onto the shortlist include Jeanette Winterson\u2019s Frankissstein, Deborah Levy\u2019s The Man Who Saw Everything and Kevin Barry\u2019s Night Boat to Tangier.\n\nThis is a life-changing prize and the winner \u2013 Rushdie is the favourite at the moment, according to William Hill \u2013 will become an instant literary star, if they are not already.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Booker Prize guide 2019 1/6 Margaret Atwood \u2013 The Testaments (Vintage, Chatto & Windus) Most people can\u2019t wait to get their hands on Margaret Atwood\u2019s long-awaited follow-up to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, which is not published until 10 September. One of the biggest books of the year, it comes 33 years after the original book was Booker Prize shortlisted. The Canadian author also won the Booker Prize for The Blind Assassin in 2000 and was shortlisted for Cat\u2019s Eye in 1989, Alias Grace in 1996 and Oryx and Crake in 2003. The Testaments is set 15 years after the end of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and follows three women\u2019s lives in Gilead. It is coming at a particularly poignant time, as its dystopian future is looking more and more possible and season three of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale comes to an end on Channel 4 \u2013 leaving a gaping hole in the lives of fans of Atwood\u2019s gripping story. Liam Sharp 2/6 Salman Rushdie \u2013 Quichotte (Vintage, Jonathan Cape) Also on this year's shortlist is Salman Rushdie, whose book Midnight\u2019s Children won the Booker Prize in 1981. In 1993, it won the Booker of Bookers, to mark the 25th anniversary of the prize, and in 2008 the Best of the Booker to mark the 40th anniversary. Quichotte, a modern day retelling of Cervantes\u2019 Don Quixote, which follows a travelling pharmaceutical salesman across America, came out last week to mixed reviews. The Independent gave it three stars, saying it is \u201cbogged down by fatiguing accumulations of examples and explanations\u201d. Rushdie was also shortlisted for Shame in 1983, The Satanic Verses in 1988, the novel which famously resulted in a fatw\u0101 calling for Rushdie's death, and The Moor\u2019s Last Sigh in 1995. He was longlisted for Shalimar the Clown in 2005 and The Enchantress of Florence in 2008. Beowulf and Sheehan 3/6 Lucy Ellmann - Ducks, Newbury Port (Galley Beggar Press) If Lucy Ellmann\u2019s novel wins the Booker Prize, it will be the longest page-turner in the history of the Prize, its 998 pages beating off The Luminaries by Eleanor Catton, which ran at 832 pages and won in 2013. Like Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s Fleabag, it is built around one woman\u2019s monologue, but not such a funny one. Told in only a handful of extremely long sentences with no paragraph breaks, an Ohio housewife frets about her past life \u2013 her love and losses, and the state of the nation, her dead parents and African elephants, among other things, in a stream-of-consciousness. Parts of the book are told from the perspective of a mountain lion \u2013 the link between the two narratives is never explained. This eighth book by the Anglo-US author might need a certain amount of commitment to get through, but it is well worth it in the end. 4/6 Chigozie Obioma \u2013 An Orchestra of Minorities (Hachette, Little Brown) Chigozie Obioma\u2019s debut, The Fisherman \u2013 a boyhood adventure in Nigeria in the Nineties \u2013 was shortlisted for the 2015 Man Booker Prize and its timely stage adaptation, opens this week in the West End. The Nigerian author\u2019s second novel is a fast-moving romantic tragicomedy, which got rave reviews and is narrated by a guardian spirit in Igbo myth. It tells the heartbreaking story of a lovestruck Nigerian chicken farmer called Chinonso in present-day Nigeria, who sacrifices everything to win the heart of the woman he loves, but in his quest to impress her family with wealth and status, falls victim to an education scam in Cyprus. The book has been dubbed \u201ca contemporary twist on the Odyssey\u201d by the publisher; but with his bursts of violent anger, Chinoso has more in common with Othello than Odysseus. Jason Keith 5/6 Bernardine Evaristo - Girl, Woman, Other (Penguin General, Hamish Hamilton) This witty novel by the Anglo-Nigerian writer follows 12 interconnected characters \u2013 mostly black British women at different stages of womanhood. The publisher describes it as \u201ca vivid portrait of the state of post-Brexit Britain that looks back to the legacy of Britain\u2019s colonial history in Africa and the Caribbean\u201d. Its characters include a successful playwright, whose work explores her black lesbian identity, a nonbinary social media influencer, a 93-year-old woman living on a farm in Northern England, and a woman who retires to Barbados hiding a secret of sex and betrayal. The author says of her book: \u201cOne of my aims as a writer is to explore the hidden narratives of the African diaspora, to play with ideas, conjure up original and innovative fiction and forms, and to subvert expectations and assumptions.\u201d Born in London in 1959, she is a professor of creative writing at Brunel University London and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Jennie Scott 6/6 Elif Shafak -10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World (Penguin General, Viking) The British-Turkish novelist Elif Shafak, who is based in London, writes in Turkish and English, and is the most widely read female author in Turkey. The latest \u2013 her 11th novel \u2013 is a grim story about a sex worker called Tequila Leila who is murdered and left in a wheelie bin on the outskirts of Istanbul. In the final 10 minutes and 38 seconds of her life, as her consciousness leaves her body, memories from her life flood the page. The book is moving and sexually violent, but ultimately compassionate and life affirming. Shafak, who is also a serious activist, is under attack from the Turkish government for her writing, and has written many bestselling books including The Bastard of Istanbul, about modern day Turkey and Islam, which confront fundamentalism and misogyny in the Middle East. Oliver Hess 1/6 Margaret Atwood \u2013 The Testaments (Vintage, Chatto & Windus) Most people can\u2019t wait to get their hands on Margaret Atwood\u2019s long-awaited follow-up to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, which is not published until 10 September.
