That just doesn\u2019t sit right with me.\u201dThe House brought the sanctions bill to the floor under suspension of the rules, meaning it needed at least two-thirds approval to pass.Despite the bipartisan majority approving the bill in the House, the effort to slap new sanctions on Ankara appears stalled in the upper chamber after Senate Majority Leader(R-Ky.) warned against rushing to sanction a NATO ally.\n\nLawmakers in both parties and chambers introduced multiple bills to sanction Turkey after Trump announced he would withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, paving the way for Ankara\u2019s long-threatened invasion.\n\nTrump himself placed sanctions on Turkey, though he lifted them after a five-day cease-fire brokered by Vice President Pence. Turkey agreed to the cease-fire in order to allow the Kurds to evacuate from a so-called safe zone.\n\n\n\nLawmakers slammed Trump for abandoning the Kurds, who were U.S. allies in the battle against ISIS and did the bulk of the most dangerous ground fighting. They have also worried the chaos from the offensive could lead to an ISIS resurgence, including allowing ISIS prisoners to escape from Kurdish-guarded detention facilities.\n\n\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperPentagon: 2 suspects captured in raid that killed ISIS leader Dog injured in al-Baghdadi raid that killed ISIS leader returns to service: report Trump says he may release video of al-Baghdadi raid MORE and special envoy for Syria James Jeffrey have said more than 100 ISIS fighters have escaped since the start of Turkey\u2019s offensive.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven with the death of al-Baghdadi, ISIS remains a serious and resurgent threat,\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiJudge schedules hearing for ex-Trump aide who refused to appear in inquiry Murkowski, Collins say they won't co-sponsor Graham's impeachment resolution Pelosi calls for Congress to pass resolution supporting two-state solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict MORE (D-Calif.) said. \u201cThe death of a top ISIS leader does not mean the death of ISIS. Scores of fighters remain under uncertain conditions in Syrian prisons and at risk of a jailbreak.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn a previous rebuke to Trump, the House earlier this month overwhelmingly passed a resolution opposing his decision to withdraw U.S. troops.\n\n\n\nTrump got a brief reprieve from Republican criticism of his Syria policy after the successful raid over the weekend in northwest Syria that led to the death of al-Baghdadi.\n\n\n\nBut many lawmakers kept up their criticism, saying the evacuation of the Kurds is tantamount to ethnic cleansing and that Trump appears to be operating on the fly instead of having a strategy by first withdrawing 50 troops and then withdrawing all troops and then deciding a few hundred will stay to guard oil fields.\n\n\n\n\u201cOver a time, we\u2019ve seen a pattern emerge. The president of the United States stokes a crisis and then steps in with some sort of half-measure in a failed attempt to look like a great deal is happening,\u201d Engel said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be the arsonist and the fireman at the same time.\u201d\n\n\n\nEngel added that Turkey\u2019s offensive has been \u201cethnic cleansing at its worst.\u201d\n\nThe lone Democratic \"no\" vote came from Rep.

The administration has yet to levy those sanctions.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the sanctions bill, the House on Tuesday passed a resolution recognizing the Armenian genocide. The bill was fiercely opposed by Turkey, which denies the Ottoman Empire\u2019s massacre of more than 1 million Armenians in 1915 was a genocide.\n\n\n\nThe votes fell on the same day as Turkey\u2019s Republic Day, which celebrates the anniversary of the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923.\n\n\n\nThe sanctions bill, dubbed the Protect Against Conflict by Turkey Act, would impose financial and visa penalties on officials connected to Turkey\u2019s offensive in Syria, including the defense minister, the chief of the general staff of the Turkish armed forces and the finance minister, as well as sanction the state-owned bank Halkbank.\n\n\n\nThe bill would also ban arms sales to Turkey and sanction foreigners providing arms to Turkish forces in Syria. It also seeks to force the administration to impose the previously mandated sanctions for Turkey\u2019s purchase of the Russian S-400 missile defense system.\n\n\n\nMcCaul called the S-400 sanctions \u201cvery important.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHow can you be a NATO ally and purchase Russian military equipment?\u201d McCaul asked. \u201cWe let Turkey into NATO to protect them from the Soviet Union, and now our NATO ally is buying Russian equipment.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the Senate, Sens.
