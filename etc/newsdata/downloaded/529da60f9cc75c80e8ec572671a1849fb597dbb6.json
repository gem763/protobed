GOP candidate backs gun control", "language": "en", "text": "Moms Demanding Action line up during a rally in the aftermath of the Virginia Beach mass shooting. (Steve Helber/AP)\n\nA Republican running for the Virginia House of Delegates is calling for stricter gun control, a message at odds with GOP leadership and virtually every Republican officeholder in the state.\n\nIn a TV ad that begins airing Tuesday, Mary Margaret Kastelberg calls for more background checks, limits on magazine size and a \u201cred flag\u201d law that would allow authorities to temporarily take guns away from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.\n\n\u201cNobody needs a 100-round magazine,\u201d said the first-time candidate who is running for a suburban Richmond seat.\n\nAlthough a handful of Virginia Republicans expressed support for limited gun control, Kastelberg goes further than any of them, said Lori Haas, state director for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that Kastelberg goes as far as gun-control advocates like Haas would like. How Kastelberg lines up against her Democratic rival, Rodney Willett, is more complicated, but they both seem to be on the same page on the \u201cred flag\u201d laws.\n\nThe two are running for the seat being vacated by freshman Del. Debra H. Rodman (D-Henrico), who is challenging Sen. Siobhan S. Dunnavant (R-Henrico).\n\nGuns have become a marquee issue this year in Virginia, where all 140 seats in the legislature are on the ballot in November. A perennial flash point in a state with rural hunting traditions and a growing urban-suburban population, guns gained special prominence this year after a mass shooting May 31 at a Virginia Beach municipal complex that left 13 dead.\n\nGov. Ralph Northam (D) called a special legislative session on guns in the aftermath, but Republicans who narrowly control the House and Senate adjourned within 90 minutes without taking up a single bill.\n\nAhead of the special session, a handful of GOP officeholders backed a measure they called a \u201cred flag\u201d law. But their version would not have allowed authorities to take weapons away from someone deemed a risk. Instead, it would have let them lock up the person \u2014 an extension of existing involuntary commitment laws for the mentally ill.\n\nKastelberg and Willett both support removing guns from individuals, as long as due process protections are in place. Kastelberg noted in particular that she supports a measure championed by a Democrat, Sen. George L. Barker (Fairfax).\n\nKastelberg is part of a crop of recruits that the GOP cultivated ahead of this year\u2019s pivotal elections to boost its appeal to educated suburban women, who have abandoned the party in droves since President Trump\u2019s election.\n\nA graduate of Princeton University and the University of Virginia\u2019s Darden School of Business, a mother and community volunteer, Kastelberg fit the profile to a T. But like so many other suburban moms, she is worried about gun violence.\n\nHer positions, she said, are \u201call grounded and rooted in where I am personally, my cumulative life experience.\u201d\n\nBy that, she doesn\u2019t just mean the mass shootings like Virginia Beach or the 2007 massacre that killed 32 at Virginia Tech, where her two children are enrolled today. She also means the murder two years ago of a young man who played in Tuckahoe Little League with her son when they were little \u2014 and all the suicides that involve guns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming from \u2014 just looking at things that might\u201d be helpful, Kastelberg said. \u201cUnfortunately, this is a really complex issue and it\u2019s highly emotionally charged. I don\u2019t believe . . . that any one thing is going to fix all of this. One of the perils that I see is rushing into something with the expectation that, \u2018Oh, now we\u2019ve solved the problem and can move on.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn the ad, Kastelberg looks at the camera and says, \u201cI\u2019ll do what\u2019s right to keep our communities safe. We\u2019ve got to work together to reduce gun violence. That starts with comprehensive background checks and closing the gun show loophole. And nobody needs a 100-round magazine. \u2018Red flag\u2019 laws will help take guns out of the hands of the mentally ill before they do harm. As a mother and a delegate, I\u2019ll work to stop gun violence to keep our loved ones safe.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Kastelberg elaborated that by \u201ccomprehensive checks,\u201d she means requiring checks on all private or commercial sales. But she would not require checks if someone gives or otherwise \u201ctransfers\u201d a gun to another person. That stops short of the \u201cuniversal\u201d background checks that Willett wants.\n\nWillett also supports a limit on magazine sizes, and he has also called for a measure intended to ensure that gun owners store their firearms in a safe manner, something Kastelberg has not sought.\n\nHe called his opponent\u2019s positions \u201clip service.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this kind of political trickery before,\u201d Willett said. \u201cMs. Kastelberg said nothing when her chief financial backer, Speaker (Kirk) Cox, blocked all gun safety reforms by shutting down the special session on gun violence in 90 minutes. If Ms. Kastelberg is serious about bucking her party, she should return the tens of thousands of dollars in political donations from Mr. Cox.\u201d\n\nHaas said she didn\u2019t find Kastelberg\u2019s stance surprising.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising in that suburban district that any candidate would be trying to answer the demands of the voters,\u201d Haas said. \u201cI don\u2019t know a suburban woman who doesn\u2019t support stronger gun laws.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "In a suburban district outside Richmond, a Republican woman breaks from party orthodoxy.", "authors": ["Laura Vozzella", "Local Reporter Covering Virginia Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/neXV5B9jbJcEe1wIvXfkzIKW5Rw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LI2TYRFDMEI6TNZSIGTZYJKRX4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
