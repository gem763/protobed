He claims he was a victim of a plot orchestrated by Nissan executives, who were anxious to prevent a merger between the company and its French partner.\n\nThe fallout from his arrest has been severe, triggering a period of intense infighting within the Nissan boardroom and poisoning the relationship with Renault.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Clotilde Delbos is now running Renault on an interim basis\n\nSince then, both companies have seen a steep fall in profits, while Nissan has been further tainted by financial scandal.\n\nEarlier this week, Nissan appointed a new chief executive, Makoto Ushida, in an effort to stop the rot, get the company back on track and smooth ruffled feathers at Renault.\n\nThe removal of Mr Bollor\u00e9 - once a close associate of Carlos Ghosn - may also have been intended, at least in part, to heal the rift between the two companies, although it is understood the the poor performance of the business itself was a major factor.\n\nSo where does all this leave the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, collectively one of the world's biggest car manufacturing groups?\n\nThe links between them are strong - Renault has a 43% shareholding in the Japanese firm, their logistics networks are heavily intertwined, and they share a range of technology. Unwinding all that would not be easy.\n\nBut insiders say the damage done by the upheaval of the past year runs deep within the fabric of both businesses. So keeping them together, and restoring a cordial relationship may not be easy.", "description": "Thierry Bollor\u00e9 is abruptly dismissed by the French carmaker after only nine months in the role.", "authors": ["Theo Leggett", "Business Correspondent", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2089/production/_109192380_zh51vb1k.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
