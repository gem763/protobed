[Everton] do a huge amount of work in the community.\n\n\"The Premier League clubs do a huge amount through solidarity payments and parachute payments, but a football club owner cannot have interests in more than one club.\n\n\"If there was an opportunity for help through the community work that happens at Everton, and they do a huge amount, then there is a conversation to be potentially had, but that is very different to Premier League clubs having an involvement in a second club.\"\n\nOther non-financial offers of help were accepted, including Manchester City allowing Bury to use the club's Carrington training ground rent-free for five years.\n\nEarlier this month a prospective new buyer for Bury ended their interest after doing due diligence, according to supporters' group Forever Bury.\n\nThe club, which plans to apply for a place in the 2019-20 National League, is currently facing a winding-up petition and could be liquidated.\n\nBoth Everton and Mr Kenwright declined to comment on the chairman's offer.\n\nYou can learn more about this story and others on Inside Out North West, at 19:30 GMT on Monday 28 October", "description": "The money would have come from Bill Kenwright's own fortune but was still banned by league rules.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/18337/production/_109372199_812e525a-4b87-4277-91d0-f8894fab7009.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
