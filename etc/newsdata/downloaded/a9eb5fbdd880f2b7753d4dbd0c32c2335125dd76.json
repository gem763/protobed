The Amnesty report, which is based on interviews with 38 people, including lawyers, medical professionals and 21 arrested protesters, found that in more than 85% of cases investigated (18 out of 21), the arrested person was hospitalized.\n\n\"Time and again, police officers meted out violence prior to and during arrests, even when the individual had been restrained or detained. The use of force was therefore clearly excessive, violating international human rights law,\" said Nicholas Bequelin, East Asia Director at Amnesty International.\n\nIn response, police said they have always respected the rights of those in custody and said there were existing complaint mechanisms in place to report alleged abuses.\n\nThe senior police commander dismissed the Amnesty report as \"not credible.\" They echoed the official remarks, adding that \"in any prolonged situation of this nature, I would be dishonest if I tell you I believe that no one has overstepped the line.\"\n\n\"You are talking about a prolonged situation where there is chaos and violent encounters, but it is important to note that we have procedures to deal with any allegations of excessive use of force,\" the commander added. \"I would note that we are covered by among the highest concentration of journalists in the world, our actions are highly transparent.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Hundreds of Hong Kong protesters sing defiant anthem Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hundreds of Hong Kong protesters sing defiant anthem 03:24\n\nEscalating violence\n\nAllegations of police brutality have been a key rallying cry of the months-long protests, with crowds calling for an independent investigation.\n\nWhile the government has announced the withdrawal of an extradition bill with China that kickstarted the summer of discontent, it has so far refused to consider investigating police outside the official system, though Chief Executive Carrie Lam has named two new members to an existing investigative body in an attempt to alleviate public concerns.\n\nThe senior police commander said that with regard to an independent investigation, \"you really have to be sure that whatever measure you take now is helpful to the resolution of the situation, that you are not playing into the hands of people whose only objective is to undermine the police so this situation could get worse.\"\n\nThe commander added that it could lessen the effectiveness of police on the front lines were they to face investigation during the unrest.\n\n\"We are still in the middle of a crisis,\" the commander said. \"Every single day we are still out there facing this threat.\"\n\nSome of the most violent scenes last week were not during the now familiar stand offs between protesters and police, but around the edges of the march, where both protester and pro-government groups attacked people who disagreed with them.\n\nCNN reporters saw a mob of masked protesters attacking a man in the Tin Hau neighborhood after a brief confrontation, leaving him dazed and bleeding on the floor. In an earlier incident, video shared widely online showed a middle-aged man wearing a blue shirt attacked and left apparently unconscious by a large group of mostly young, black-clad protesters on Gloucester Road. According to the South China Morning Post, the unidentified man had shouted pro-police slogans before the attack.\n\nLater on Sunday, a group of mostly middle-aged men were seen striking and threatening protesters in the North Point area. The area has a large mainland Chinese immigrant population, and there have been attacks on protesters in the area in past weeks.\n\nSunday's violence came after a number of angry scuffles on Saturday between pro and anti-government groups, though none reached the level of violence seen the following day. Pro-Beijing groups sang the Chinese national anthem and pulled down \"Lennon Walls,\" collections of notes and flyers erected by protesters, around the city.\n\nThere were fears of further scuffles this weekend over a \"Clean Hong Kong\" campaign organized by stridently anti-protest lawmaker Junius Ho . Speaking to CNN earlier this week, Ho described the event on Saturday as an \"environmental hygiene campaign\" and said he \"would not urge any confrontation\" with protesters.\n\nPolice expressed concern that there would be violence during these events, and said they could potentially be declared an illegal gathering.\n\n\"In the end if there is violence we will deal with that,\" the senior police commander said.\n\nPhotos: Hong Kong unrest Pro-government and anti-government supporters chant against one another at a shopping mall in Hong Kong on Friday, September 13.

Hide Caption 78 of 78\n\nPolice under pressure\n\nSpeaking to reporters, senior police commanders emphasized the extreme pressure the force is under as the protests enter their sixteenth week.\n\n\"When we're off duty, we can't even have that sanctuary of normality,\" one commander said. \"Officers can't even get married without protesters turning up to their wedding parties.\"\n\nPolice officials said a team of clinical psychologists was working with front line officers to provide support and allow police time to decompress from the stress and abuse. \"We all recognize that this has an emotional toll, and our officers need to be supported,\" a senior commander said.\n\nThe commander added that \"we are in a very desperate situation. We are the only agency that Hong Kong as a whole can rely on. For the desperate citizens, the law abiding citizens, we are the only part of the political structure in Hong Kong that they can rely on.\"\n\nHowever, commanders rejected a suggestion that they were being asked to solve a problem that is beyond their capabilities and not receiving enough support from government. Previously, a senior police official told CNN that \"this is a political issue, a political issue needs a political solution to solve it.\"\n\nOn Friday, senior officers suggested that the situation could be relieved by courts taking a larger role in enforcing the rule of law, such as fast tracking trials and granting less bail in cases of protester violence.", "description": "Hong Kong is headed into its sixteenth consecutive weekend of anti-government protests, as police warned the level of violence is escalating potentially beyond control, as the force faced renewed allegations of brutality.", "authors": ["James Griffiths"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190920174540-hong-kong-protest-violence-01-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
