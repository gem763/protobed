This year, 75% of audits reached that goal, the FRC said, slightly up from 73% in the prior year.\n\n\u201cWe are not seeing more immediate improvements from the [audit] firms and there is undesirable inconsistency across the market,\u201d Sir Winfried Bischoff, the outgoing chairman of the FRC, said in the report.\n\nThe warning comes despite the fact that the FRC stepped up its enforcement efforts during the year ended March 31. The regulator levied \u00a332 million ($39.5 million) in fines on firms, including some of the Big Four companies Deloitte & Touche LLP, Ernst & Young LLP, KPMG LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP during the year, up from \u00a313.1 million during the prior year. Newsletter Sign-up High-profile corporate collapses and shortfalls in audits of financial statements at U.K. companies have fueled concerns about the work provided by the Big Four accounting firms. Regulators and lawmakers have suggested a flurry of measures to address potential conflicts of interests at large audit companies, but the government has yet to respond to some of the proposals. The FRC appointed a new chief executive in July.

The creation of the body requires new regulation, which hasn\u2019t been passed yet. The regulator in its report singled out two audit firms in particular, KPMG and Grant Thornton U.K. LLP. KPMG \u201chad shown an unacceptable deterioration in quality, and this year we have carried out additional reviews of its audits,\u201d said Stephen Haddrill, the FRC\u2019s outgoing CEO. Grant Thornton has to prepare and implement a detailed action plan to enhance the quality of its audits, the FRC said. KPMG and Grant Thornton didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Write to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
