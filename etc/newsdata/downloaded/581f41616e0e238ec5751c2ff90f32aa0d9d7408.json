Meanwhile in Kings Cross mothers insisted Google should ban those who deny or question climate change from posting videos on Youtube.\n\nThe eco-activist group has now said its members will protest 'mischievously' at Gatwick airport tomorrow, promising 'musicians, clowns and singers.'\n\nToday's protests are in open defiance of the Metropolitan Police, who on Monday issued a Section 14 order prohibiting XR demonstrations anywhere in the capital and leaving any protestors at risk of arrest.\n\nGuardian writer George Monbiot, who had penned a column on why he hoped to be arrested, was dragged away by police, as was Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley.\n\nGuardian writer George Monbiot is taken away by police at the demo, after writing a column on why he hoped to be arrested\n\nPolice moved in on the Extinction Rebellion protest, including Guardian columnist George Monbiot (recumbent, with sign)\n\nSupporters had prevented Monbiot from being carried away by police, by lying next to him so they must be removed first\n\nGreen Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley was also arrested and carried away by police during the climate change protest\n\nPolice arrested others, including this woman, as climate change activists were replaced by other demonstrators as each was taken away\n\nIn Trafalgar Square councillor Andree Frieze, Green Party candidate for Richmond South, who took part, said: 'This symbolises the way our voices are being shut down, our voices are not being listened to.\n\n'Other people have brought the tape and they're sharing it around. It's a very powerful symbol of how our protest is being silenced. I believe the police action is illegal.\n\n'This is a question of civil liberties. Everyone at Trafalgar Square now is at risk of arrest.'\n\nOnline the group announced its members plan to target Gatwick Airport tomorrow morning, with protesters planning to arrive at the South Terminal at 11am.\n\nPosting on group messaging app, one member urged others to 'come incognito' and then 'reveal yourself' after a signal is given adding 'musicians, clowns and singers' would be welcome and that 'some people may like to indulge in a bit of mischief'.\n\nThe Sun reported that the post read: 'We're going on a trip to Gatwick Airport!\n\n'With a light-hearted, informative vibe, lets give a wake-up call (again) about the urgent need to reduce the number of flights, not expand airports.\n\n'We call on passengers and friends to join us in tackling the Climate and Ecological Emergency.\n\n'They have the opportunity to contribute to safeguarding our future by limiting air travel to just essential journeys. Let's make them welcome.\n\n'Come incognito and await the signal at 11am to reveal yourself!\n\n'Performers, musicians, clowns, singers, party hats welcome. We will be handing out leaflets encouraging people to play their part in what lies ahead.\n\n'If inclined, some people may like to indulge in a bit of mischief but the intention is not to cause people to miss flights. Fun and imagination welcome.\n\n'Though we can't know what line the police or airport staff will take, so far as we know there is nothing in what we have outlined that would be against airport byelaws.'\n\nClimate activist George Monbiot had been refusing to move from the road at Whitehall.\n\nMr Monbiot, 56, has been warned by police if he continues to obstruct the highway he will be detained for a breach of public order.\n\nHe was surrounded by Extinction Rebellion supporters, including 20 'red brigade' protesters.\n\nSupporters are preventing Monbiot from being carried away by police, by lying next to him so they must be removed first.\n\nPolice have arrested three people beside Mr Monbiot so far, who have been replaced by other activists.\n\nProtesters have surrounded those lying on the street, chanting 'power to the people' and drumming.\n\nGreen Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley has been arrested after joining climate change protesters on Whitehall, the party said.\n\nThey tweeted: 'Our co-leader @jon-bartley has been arrested on Whitehall whilst peacefully protesting.'\n\nIn open defiance of Monday's police ban, Extinction Rebellion protestors gathered en masse in Trafalgar Square again today\n\nToday a senior Met officer insisted the ban on XR's 'Autumn Uprising' climate change protests issued on Monday is legal - despite a review having been requested by lawyers - and warned activists they face arrest.\n\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor, who is leading the policing of the demonstrations, said he is 'completely comfortable' with the action the force has taken.\n\nLawyers for XR were at the High Court on Wednesday to apply for a judicial review of the ban amid claims that the order is not legal and breaches the right to protest.\n\nMr Taylor said: 'We are very confident that what we've done is entirely lawful, entirely proportionate in the circumstances, and we are completely comfortable with the position that we maintain.'\n\nThe force used section 14 of the Public Order Act initially to restrict the protest action to Trafalgar Square, but following 'continued breaches' of the order officers moved in to clear the area.\n\nAny assembly of more than two people linked to the XR Autumn Uprising action is now illegal in London.\n\nActivists have defied the ban, with breastfeeding mothers with babies and children staging a sit in outdside the offices of Google and YouTube, as well as the rally at Trafalgar Square.\n\nThe Extinction Rebellion 'Autumn Uprising' in London started last Monday and has caused widespread disruption in the city\n\nToday protestors with black duct tape across their mouths reclaimed Trafalgar Square from which they were moved on\n\nSo far 1,642 protesters have been arrested, and 133 charged. XR's stated tactics are to overwhelm the capacity in police custody, including by refusing bail after being arrested.\n\nAsked whether officers will arrest everyone who attends Trafalgar Square today in defiance of the Section 14 order, Mr Taylor said: 'We will take a balanced and proportionate response to whatever we're faced with, as we have done since Monday.\n\n'If people do assemble at Trafalgar Square they are clearly in breach of the section 14 conditions and are therefore liable to arrest.\n\n'As with all policing we will review the situation and will make decisions that are appropriate to those circumstances. But people, if they gather there, are liable to arrest.'\n\nAmong those who announced they intended to get arrested at the rally are environment journalist George Monbiot\n\nA woman in a vicar's dog collar is photographed protesting against the Met's order for XR protests to cease city-wide\n\nThe rally outside the Natiojnal Gallery is a provocation to police, who stopped short of saying all attendees would be arrested\n\nOn Thursday XR activists plan to target the Tube network, which the senior officer called 'unacceptable'.\n\nHe said: 'Tomorrow Extinction Rebellion have explicitly said they intend to target the Underground network.\n\n'That will cause huge disruption for London and we consider that wholly unacceptable, and obviously will be policing that with our partners at British Transport Police.\n\n'It will cause a huge impact to London and all the commuters and everybody using the Underground network. Obviously we will be policing that proactively and robustly.'\n\nJulian Thompson, from XR, said: 'We have been on the streets to demand that the Government produces a plan to deal with the climate and ecological emergency.\n\n'The Government's silence is deafening, with no mention of it in the Queen's Speech, which is their programme for government for the year.\n\n'At a time when it's more important than ever to peacefully assemble and protest on these emergencies, we are now at risk of being silenced by the authorities.\n\n'This is a dangerous precedent. We need more democracy, not less.'\n\nA Government spokesman said: 'The UK is already taking world-leading action to combat climate change as the first major economy to legislate to end our contribution to global warming entirely by 2050.\n\n'While we share people's concerns about global warming, and respect the right to peaceful protest, it should not disrupt people's day-to-day lives.'\n\nA large crowd of mothers with children and babies, including several women who breeastfed their babies during the protest, gathered outside Google's London HQ\n\nExtinction Rebellion activists block the entrance to Google UK headquarters in Kings Cross London, demanding accountability from the Internet giant when representing climate change on their Youtube platform\n\nThe action comes days after a London wide ban on Extinction Rebellion was imposed by the Metropolitan Police\n\nDemonstrators, including mothers and babies, take part in a protest organised by Extinction Rebellion, outside of the doors of the Google offices in London", "description": "XR protestors returned to Trafalgar Square this afternoon in defiance of a Section 14 order issued by the Met on Monday evening which outlawed Extinction Rebellion protests city-wide.", "authors": ["Joel Adams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/16/19793722-0-image-a-180_1571238632686.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
