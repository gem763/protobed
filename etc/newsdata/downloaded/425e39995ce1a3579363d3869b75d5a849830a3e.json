He wants to grow Splend's 2500 member drivers to more than 15,000 within a few years.\n\n\"We have launched into London, Toronto and Mexico City,\" Mr King said.\n\n\"They are very large cities. London has 8 million people, Mexico City has more people than all of Australia and Toronto is the same size as Sydney.\n\nSteve Smith debuts even after a horror year Atlassian duo supercharge a record year of wealth The fitness star and the Millennial bank Atlassian co-founders Australia\u2019s richest young entrepreneurs Targeting Uber drivers a splendid move for Chris King Where are the women?

Mr King estimates that within six months revenue from its international operations will outpace its home market.\n\nHelping drive the expansion is industry veteran Abe Tomas, a former chief financial officer of global titan Lease Plan, who was recently appointed Spend chief financial officer and will join its board.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe growth has come amid competition from major leasing players including General Motors' Maven. Mr King, a former WA government ministerial officer, argues Splend's technology, driver training and coaching sets it apart from the competition.\n\n\"We have a lot of smarts to help them [drivers] earn more money,\" Mr King said.\n\n\"Our competitors will say here is a car, see you later go for it. We say we are not the cheapest, we may be an extra $20 or $30 a week more expensive, but we can almost guarantee that you will earn more money with us.\"\n\nAside from the individual data it tracks on its 2500 (and growing) drivers, Splend provides information on key events in various locations that allow drivers to be at the right place and the right time. It helps them earn during \"surge\", or higher, pricing.\n\n\"If Uber told all its drivers there's an event at Sydney Opera House and it's going to finish at 10pm they would all go there and there would not be enough people for all the cars. There wouldn't be work and there would be surge pricing everywhere else,\" Mr King said.\n\nHelping drive Splend's expansion is industry veteran Abe Tomas, left, who Chris King recently appointed as global chief financial officer. Philip Gostelow\n\n\"We see where the drivers earn the most amount of money driving, what hours they are working, what areas generally result in higher fares. \"\n\nIt's so far been a successful ride. Yet being on the Young Rich List doesn't sit too comfortably with Mr King, a feeling shared by many of his fellow cohort.\n\n\"I'm not trying to be cliche here but money doesn't motivate me. I don't like the focus being on me because we have a lot of people in the business and we help out our members. I want to make sure that our members are successful, that the team are successful and that we are a successful business ultimately by helping our customers.\"", "description": "Thirty-year-old Perth entrepreneur Chris King is worth a small fortune after starting Splend, a company leasing cars to Uber drivers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.4566%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1752%2C$x_248%2C$y_308/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0486881bc3c6204ed09947fc9aebcb3ae844f331", "published_at": "2018-10-21"}
