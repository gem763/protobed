The first will enter service in 2021.\n\nThe company said its aim is to meet the targets set out in the Paris agreement 10 years earlier than specified.\n\nStill, some Amazon employees don't feel the company has gone far enough.\n\nMore than 1,500 workers pledged to stage a \"walkout\" protest on Friday against the company's environmental record.\n\nOn Thursday, Google said it would make the \"biggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history\" with a string of new solar and energy deals.\n\nChief executive Sundar Pichai said the agreements include more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) in new energy infrastructure, including millions of solar panels and hundreds of wind turbines.\n\n\"Once all these projects come online, our carbon-free energy portfolio will produce more electricity than places like Washington DC or entire countries like Lithuania or Uruguay use each year,\" Mr Pichai said in a blog post.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Google boss Sundar Pichai said the firm would make green energy investments in the US, Chile and Europe\n\nSwedish retailer Ikea also touted its green energy efforts.\n\nOn Thursday, Ingka Group - which owns most Ikea stores - said recent investments in wind and solar will enable the firm to beat its 2020 target to produce as much renewable energy as it consumes.\n\nThe company has spent billions on wind farms and solar panels at its stores, and said it recently purchased a stake in two US solar parks.\n\nChief executive Jesper Brodin told Reuters the company would continue to invest in solar parks and wind farms.\n\n\"Being climate smart is not an added cost. It's actually smart business and what the business model of the future will look like... Everything around fossil fuels and daft use of resources will be expensive,\" Mr Brodin said.", "description": "Amazon and Google are among global firms setting out new green energy plans as climate pressure rises.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5DB3/production/_108878932_solarwind.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
