Al-Baghdadi detonated a suicide vest after a firefight with U.S. special operations forces in Idlib province near the Turkish border, two sources said.\n\nThe White House said late Saturday that President Trump would be making a \"major statement\" Sunday at 9 a.m. ET. Mr. Trump appeared to hint at the news Saturday night, tweeting that \"something very big has just happened!\"\n\nThe Syrian Observatory of Human Rights (SOHR) said the raid took place at a compound at about 12:30 a.m. local time to the west of the town of Barisha, a mountainous area about 25 miles west of Aleppo overlooking the Turkish border. The group said the area is a hotbed of activity for an al Qaeda affiliate in Syria.\n\nSOHR said a gunfight lasted for about two hours, with an Arabic speaker accompanying U.S. forces urging those in the compound to surrender over loudspeaker. The group said nine people were killed, including two women and a child. Eyewitnesses told the group that two people were alive when the operation was over and were taken away on U.S. helicopters.\n\nThe Syrian Defense Forces (SDF), the Kurdish group that has fought alongside U.S. forces against ISIS, hailed the operation on Sunday.\n\n\"Successful& historical operation due to a joint intelligence work with the United States of America,\" said General Mazloum Abdi, the SDF commander.\n\nAl-Baghdadi, who has rarely been seen in public, appeared in a video in April for the first time in five years. The video, released by ISIS' media network, showed al-Baghdadi with a bushy grey and red beard and seated with a machine gun next to him. That was his first video appearance since 2014, when he delivered a sermon at the al-Nuri mosque in the Iraqi city of Mosul.\n\nThis image made from video posted on a militant website on Monday, April 29, 2019, purports to show the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, being interviewed by his group's Al-Furqan media outlet. AP\n\nIn December 2016, the U.S. State Department raised its reward to $25 million for information on al-Baghdadi, making him one of the most wanted terrorists in the world.\n\nAl-Baghdadi's death comes just days after the U.S. announced it would be sending additional troops into Syria to protect oil fields from ISIS.\n\nThursday's announcement was a reversal of Mr. Trump's earlier decision to pull U.S. forces from the area, which sparked a Turkish cross-border offensive earlier this month, and raised concerns that ISIS could regain strength. Kurdish forces in northern Syria had been the main U.S. allies in the fight against ISIS.\n\nMr. Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria was criticized by Republican and Democratic leaders.\n\nAl-Baghdadi was born in 1971 and claimed to have been descended from the Prophet Muhammad. After the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2004, al-Baghdadi was detained in a prison camp that became an incubator for jihadis.\n\nReleased a year later, he joined al Qaeda's offshoot in Iraq, rising to become its leader, before moving into the chaos of Syria's civil war and renaming his group ISIS.\n\nAt its peak, ISIS ruled over an estimated 10 million people in Iraq and Syria, enslaving women, performing public executions and expanding its reign of terror to Europe and the U.S.\n\nMargaret Brennan and Holly Williams contributed to this report.", "description": "The White House said late Saturday that President Trump would be making a \"major statement\" Sunday at 9 a.m.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/29/2152ec23-0930-4b82-a32a-357b6659d267/thumbnail/1200x630/0bc4d01c0cff9694285c9daf5f516ff1/ap-19119606463971.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
