I think every time I\u2019ve come on a done well and shown why I think I should be playing.\n\n\u201cI think tonight was a good statement and a good way for me to put across a performance and hopefully I\u2019ll be starting in the next run of games.\u201d\n\nHaving scored 10 goals in 13 games, there is no doubt Nketiah knows where the goal is, but his all-round game is still raw.

I went there to play and I think I believe I\u2019m good enough to be playing in the team. I want to kick on when I get back and hopefully get a run of games.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Eddie Nketiah says his hat-trick for England Under-21s shows he deserves to be starting for Leeds.
