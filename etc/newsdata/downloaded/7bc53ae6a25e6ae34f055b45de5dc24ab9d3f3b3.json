The latest Newspoll shows the Coalition has held its two-party preferred lead of 51 per cent to 49 per cent - the fourth consecutive poll with a two-point margin between the major parties. Popular support for the government remains the same at 42 per cent and 33 per cent for Labor. Scott Morrison is still the preferred Prime Minister with an approval rating of 47 per cent, despite falling three points, and support for Opposition leader Anthony Albanese in the top job has lifted to 32 per cent. The gap between the two leaders as preferred prime minister is now the closest since the election.
