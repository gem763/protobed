Instead, he gave a vague summary of the \"long, friendly\" exchange.\n\nThe minister also appeared to give Trump relief from claims that in the call he had pressured Zelensky into investigating the Ukrainian business activities of Hunter Biden, son of Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden.\n\nPrystaiko said: \"If someone thinks that pressure has been put on our president, they should determine it. I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure.\"\n\nHere is the full answer:\n\n\"I think this is the confrontation they are trying to get us into ... People involved in Ukrainian-American relations understand that we have always tried to appreciate the help from both [US] parties.\n\n\"This assured us that with the change of administration we would not change our priorities in relations with the USA. Indeed, the US presidents have supported us, and we appreciate the support of Congress.\n\n\"But this does not mean that they would like to help, and even could in theory help one of the parties. We are an independent state, we have our secrets.\n\n\"The president has the right to speak with another president so that this conversation remains unknown to anyone. This is the only premise that leaders still share important and often sensitive information. US investigators have every right to contact the US to obtain this information.\n\n\"If someone thinks that pressure has been put on our president, they should determine it. I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure.\n\n\"Conversations are different, leaders have the right to discuss any existing issues. This conversation was long, friendly, and addressed many issues.\"\n\nIn the US, the furor over Trump's dealings with Zelensky has led to renewed calls for his impeachment, including from Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who was previously reluctant to support impeachment.\n\nAlso on Friday, Biden called for Trump to release the transcript of the call so that \"the American people can judge for themselves\" what went on.\n\nTrump himself over the weekend seemed to toy with releasing the transcript of the call, though he previously seemed reluctant to.\n\nAccording to The Hill, he told reporters: \"We'll make a determination about how to release it, releasing it, saying what we said...\" He added that \"you have to be a little bit shy about doing that.\"", "description": "In a little-noticed interview, Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Minister insisted that the contents of calls between two presidents should remain secret.", "authors": ["Irina Titova"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d88e23b2e22af196e4c35a0-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
