(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nMiami University of Ohio researchers have discovered a way to sustainably produce a promising drug used for treatment-resistant depression \u2014 and it comes from the ground.\n\nIn a new study in the journal Metabolic Engineering, J. Andrew Jones, PhD, an assistant professor at Miami\u2019s department of chemical, paper, and biomedical engineering, along with a team of undergraduate students discovered a way to sustainably produce psilocybin \u2014 an active compound that\u2019s naturally found in a type of psychedelic mushroom called Psilocybe cubensis \u2014 in large quantities.\n\nPsilocybin, which is currently in several clinical trials, shows promising results in treating depression (including treatment-resistant depression in which standard therapies aren\u2019t helping), as well as addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nHowever, producing large quantities of the ingredient would require \u201cextensive real estate\u201d to plant the mushrooms and \u201ctime,\u201d according to a statement released by Miami University. Although there are synthetic versions of psilocybin, the researchers note that they\u2019re very expensive. So the Miami University researchers looked for ways to sustainably produce psilocybin in a more affordable and faster way. They were able to do so by genetically engineering a host \u2014 in this case, the bacteria E.coli \u2014 to produce psilocybin.\n\n\u201cThe main goal of the research was to show the potential of a genetically-modified strain of E. coli to produce psilocybin in a sustainable, reproducible, and controlled way,\u201d Jones tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThe hope is that this strain will be a faster, cheaper, and/or more controlled method for psilocybin production than current production methods (mushroom, synthetic chemical synthesis). This production method is being developed in response to positive clinical trial results performed elsewhere and in anticipation of FDA approval in the future.\u201d\n\nIn the study, researchers were pleasantly surprised about the speed at which they were able to produce psilocybin, compared to growing actual mushrooms. \u201cOver the course of this study we improved production from only a few milligrams per liter to over a gram per liter, a near 500-fold increase,\u201d Jones said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIn theory, enough mushrooms could be grown, but it is not all that practical,\u201d Jones tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cOur production process [in the study], from beginning to end, only takes a few days to complete compared to much longer for mushrooms. Additionally, the E. coli route also would be less variable, enabling a more consistent pharmaceutical product.\u201d\n\nThe study results are significant because Jones and his fellow researchers \u201cenabled a common commercially-available strain of bacteria (E. coli) to have the ability to produce psilocybin.\u201d He adds, \u201cThis is the first time a bacteria has been reported to make the compound.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s next? More research, of course.\n\n\u201cWe are currently working to improve the genetic background of our E. coli strain to make it a more stable and efficient host for the biosynthesis,\u201d Jones tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cAs with all research, it will take some time to develop the technology, but we do plan to publish our findings once they are discovered and reproduced.
