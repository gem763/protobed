Jim Jordan says Jake Tapper and other journalists are doing intellectual \u201cgymnastics\u201d during discussions about Hunter Biden\u2019s $50,000-per-month gig with a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nThe Ohio Republican and CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d host engaged in an explosive interview on Sunday in which both men seemed astonished at the other\u2019s position.\n\nAt issue was President Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, along with the credibility of a CIA whistleblower who acted without having first-hand information.\n\n\u201cMy guess is, if you ask the American people, when they look at what happened with [former Vice President Joseph R.] Biden\u2019s son \u2014 he got paid $50,000 dollars, Jake. [He received] $50,000 a month for several years. Come on,\u201d Mr. Jordan said Sunday. \u201cThe Vice President\u2019s son gets paid $50,000 a month and gets hired by a company in an industry he has no experience in and, \u2018oh, that\u2019s fine,\u2019 and all you folks in the press and Democrats, \u2018oh, no problem here.\u2019 Try taking that message to the American people. \u2026 I wonder what Hunter Biden did in those board meetings. Did he just look at his phone and check out the sports scores? But he\u2019s getting paid $50,000, and then when the company that\u2019s paying him that money is under investigation \u2014 guess what? Daddy comes running to the rescue [to get the prosecutor fired].\u201d\n\nMr. Tapper then raised his voice while saying, \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe European Union, the Obama administration, the International Monetary Fund, pro-clean government activists in Ukraine thought that the prosecutor was not prosecuting corruption,\u201d the reporter continued, Mediaite reported. \u201c[Hunter] was paid by Burisma, but Joe Biden was trying to get a prosecutor who was not pursuing corruption fired.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing what gymnastics you guys will go through to defend [Biden.]\u201d Mr. Jordan replied.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not gymnastics,\u201d Mr. Tapper, exasperated, said. \u201cIt\u2019s facts!\u201d\n\nMr. Jordan maintained that it was wise to be skeptical of the whistleblower because the individual did not have first-hand information when the report was filed, and an Aug. 26 letter from the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community noted \u201csome indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate.\u201d\n\nThe letter by Inspector General Michael Atkinson added that \u201csuch evidence did not change my determination that the complaint relating to the urgent concern \u2018seems credible.\u2019\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
