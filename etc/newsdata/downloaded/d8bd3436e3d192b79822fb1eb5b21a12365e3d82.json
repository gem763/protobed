The team is exactly where we want to be, mentally and physically, ahead of the weekend.\n\n\"We're really looking forward to this opportunity.\"\n\nHansen added: \"Both teams have a common goal, which is to make the final.\n\n\"However, we've arrived at this point with vastly different experiences from previous Rugby World Cups. No doubt, those experiences will resurface throughout the week and even in the game itself.\n\n\"Let's hope the game lives up to the expectation that both teams will have, and is one for the ages.\"\n\nIn-form Anton Lienert-Brown and Jack Goodhue get the nod in midfield, with cross-code star Sonny Bill Williams again on the bench.\n\nTwo-time World Rugby player of the year Beauden Barrett starts at full-back, with relatively inexperienced wingers George Bridge and Sevu Reece completing the back three.\n\nRichie Mo'unga is named at flyhalf alongside regular scrum-half Aaron Smith.\n\nKieran Read captains from No 8, where he lines up with Barrett and Ardie Savea. Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock pack down in the boiler house, with Joe Moody and Nepo Laulala propping up Codie Taylor.\n\nDane Coles, Ofa Tu'ungafasi and Angus Ta'avao provide front-row cover, with Tuipulotu and Cane on the bench alongside TJ Perenara, Williams and a third Barrett, utility back Jordie.\n\nNew Zealand and England have played each other 41 times, with the All Blacks winning 33, England seven and one draw.\n\nThe last run-out between the two sides was a 16-15 victory for the All Blacks at Twickenham in November last year.\n\nTeams:\n\nNew Zealand\n\n\n\n15 Beauden Barrett, 14 Sevu Reece, 13 Jack Goodhue, 12 Anton Lienert-Brown, 11 George Bridge, 10 Richie Mo'unga, 9 Aaron Smith, 8 Kieran Read (captain), 7 Ardie Savea, 6 Scott Barrett, 5 Sam Whitelock, 4 Brodie Retallick, 3 Nepo Laulala, 2 Cody Taylor, 1 Joe Moody\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Dane Coles, 17 Ofa Tu'ungafasi, 18 Angus Ta'avao, 19 Patrick Tuipulotu, 20 Sam Cane, 21 TJ Perenara, 22 Sonny Bill Williams, 23 Jordie Barrett\n\nEngland\n\nTBA", "description": "Defending champions New Zealand have made one change to their side to play England in the Rugby World Cup semi-finals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2487/8ae991c9ea9744b0a25d035bc4d271c2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
