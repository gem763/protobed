Manchester City (-) City started strongly with a 3-0 win over Shakhtar and remain in the top spot Getty Images\n\nManchester City vs Dinamo Zagreb\n\nDespite being the only English team to win on matchday one, Manchester City come into this game 2nd in Group C. They welcome early group-toppers Dinamo Zagreb, who beat Atalanta 4-0, to the Etihad on Tuesday.\n\nOne of City\u2019s main men at the moment, Riyad Mahrez\u2019s rich run of form stretches back to their 3-0 dismissal of Shaktar Donetsk on matchday one. The winger scored and laid on an assist for Ilkay Gundogan on the night which he has followed up with stellar performances against Watford an Everton \u2013 games in which he registered two goals and an assist.\n\nAs for Zagreb, being top of the group and winning their past two games 11-0 on aggregate, they may go to the Etihad Stadium with nothing to fear.\n\nPep Guardiola\u2019s side proved last year that they are not immune to a group stage upset, when a Nabil Fekir-inspired Lyon turned them over. However, the likelihood of that happening again, especially after Norwich\u2019s 3-2 win a fortnight ago, may be too far-fetched.\n\nIf they are to dent City\u2019s ambitions of controlling the group, Mislav Orsic may be the man to look to after his hat-trick vs Atalanta.\n\nTottenham Hotspur vs Bayern Munich\n\nTottenham\u2019s unfortunate run of throwing games away began with their 2-2 draw with Olympiacos on matchday one. But a well-fought victory over Southampton may just be what they needed ahead of a massive night against Bayern Munich on Tuesday.\n\nGoing down to ten men moments before Hugo Lloris gifted the Saints an equaliser, they showed great resolve to rescue three points. This, along with the ever-impressive goal-scoring form of Harry Kane \u2013 three goals in three games \u2013 will be incredibly important in looking for their first Champions League win this season.\n\nBayern Munich will, of course, be Spurs\u2019 toughest test of the group, however. The German giants began their European campaign in the best way possible \u2013 a 3-0 win over Red Star Belgrade \u2013 and haven\u2019t looked back.\n\nThey\u2019ve won their last two games, with Phillippe Coutinho, who helped Barcelona run riot at Wembley last year, both scoring and assisting twice. Mauricio Pochetino\u2019s side may need to handle the Brazilian with extra caution at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nLille vs Chelsea\n\nBoth Lille and Chelsea lost on matchday one so Wednesday\u2019s meeting will be crucial to make up ground on Ajax and Valencia.\n\nUnder Frank Lampard, Chelsea have been a slow burner, with positive performances not always yielding the necessary results. Having put out a strong team against Valencia, and with a win needed, it\u2019s likely that Lampard will do the same this time around with some integration of players that starred in the Carabao Cup against Grimsby.\n\nReece James and Callum Hudson-Odoi are the most highly anticipated players to build on their returns and a Champions League night at Lille could be the best place for that.\n\nLille fell 3-0 to Ajax on matchday one, however, having won all of their home matches this season, Chelsea should be on guard at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy.\n\nLiverpool vs Red Bull Salzburg\n\nLast year\u2019s champions close Champions League proceedings this week by hosting Red Bull Salzburg.\n\nJurgen Klopp\u2019s side fell 2-0 to Napoli a fortnight ago and although a win may be more likely this time around, it\u2019s not a foregone conclusion.\n\nSalzburg will have their tails up after a 6-2 win opening day win over Genk but they could be without hat-trick hero Erling Haaland. The 19-year-old, who has 12 league goals in ten games for Salzburg is suffering with an illness as confirmed by the club\u2019s sporting director Christoph Freund on Sunday.\n\nHe didn\u2019t play in Salzburg\u2019s game against FK Austria Wien on Saturday, but they still ran out 4-1 winners with Sekou Koita scoring twice.", "description": "The Champions League returns for gameweek two, with England\u2019s four representatives at the top table of European competition back in action.
