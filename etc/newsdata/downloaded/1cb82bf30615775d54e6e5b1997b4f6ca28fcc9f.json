I just couldn't believe it!\n\n'She was with Charlotte and George looking at Halloween outfits but her bodyguard was kind of watching people with phones and telling them no pictures. I managed to get the photo as she was at the self service check out.\n\n'I didn't see what she actually bought. The lady that told me she was there had children with her and she said Kate was asking her children what they were going to be for Halloween. I think she bought some Halloween bits for her kinds but I don't know what.'\n\nA children's witch outfit from Sainsbury's costs around \u00a39.00 and a boy's skeleton outfit also costs \u00a39.00.\n\nKate even asked some children what they were going to dress up as for Halloween while shopping at Sainsbury's in Hardwick (pictured)\n\nKathy from Norwich, said Kate seemed 'down to earth' and looked 'beautiful as always.'\n\nCharlotte, four, and George, six, followed their mother closely as they walked through the shop.\n\nShe added: 'It was so lovely to see her doing normal stuff that you and I do.\n\n'It was so lovely to see her, she is always beautiful. You don't expect to see that when you go shopping! I couldn't concentrate on my shopping.\n\n'Kate was wearing black trousers and a black polo neck. Charlotte was wearing a little checkered skirt but I couldn't see anything else. She was saying: 'Come on kids' she just understandably wanted to keep them safe.\n\n'You just don't expect it to happen, you think Kate would shop in Waitrose or Harrods!\n\n'She just seemed so down to earth and beautiful as always!'\n\nSocial media users were also full of praise her for being in the supermarket, describing her as 'relatable.'\n\nOne on Instagram said: 'Over the years I've enjoyed seeing pics of Kate going about a routine things like shopping.\n\n'She is a perfect representative of the Crown while on royal duties, and just relatable Kate when not on duties.'\n\nKate was previously seen in The Range in Norfolk with George and Charlotte last December as they looked for some last-minute buys.", "description": "Kate, 37, who was seen between 11am and noon this morning, was photographed at the self-service counter, at Sainsbury's in Hardwick, Cambridgeshire.", "authors": ["Joe Middleton", "Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/17/20141592-0-image-a-48_1571932912804.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
