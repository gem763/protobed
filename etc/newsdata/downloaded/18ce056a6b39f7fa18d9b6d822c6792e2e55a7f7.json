The Guggenheim was one of eight of Wright's buildings to be awarded Unesco World Heritage status in July.\n\nHere are 10 of his most striking creations.\n\nThe Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, New York City, USA\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAlthough the curving Guggenheim is, in many ways, a world away from the blocky, Cubism-inspired designs of properties such as the Fallingwater house in Pennsylvania, it still has various Frank Lloyd Wright trademarks. The use of exposed concrete and the inclusion of a large glass dome, for starters. The museum was built to house the art collection owned by Solomon R Guggenheim, and it opened six months after Wright\u2019s death. Fun fact? Wright originally wanted the exterior to be bright red, which the architect believed was the \u201ccolour of creation\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Wright achieved this by adding a beautiful courtyard, ornate patterned window frames and various other decorative touches, such as the beautiful pendant lamps in the dining room. Look closely and you\u2019ll also notice the former school\u2019s unusual dimensions \u2013 Wright designed this as a \u201cchild-sized\u201d building.\n\nUnity Temple, Chicago, USA\n\nThe Unity Temple, designed as a replacement for Chicago\u2019s Oak Park Unity Church, is another of those buildings given Unesco World Heritage status this summer. It was a major game-changer in the field of ecclesiastic architecture \u2013 a cube made from bare concrete, topped with an enormous slab \u2013 and one of the first of Wright's buildings made with exposed concrete, something which became his signature style. He compensated for the fortress-like appearance and lack of windows by installing skylights made with green, brown and yellow glass, designed to remind worshippers of the natural world.\n\nKing Kamehameha Golf Course Clubhouse, Hawaii, USA\n\nIf the Jetsons played golf, this is where they\u2019d tee off. Full disclosure \u2013 Frank Lloyd Wright had died by the time the King Kamehameha Golf Course Clubhouse was built, but it was modelled on the house Wright had designed for Arthur Miller, who wanted to build a house for his wife, Marilyn Monroe. When the pair divorced, the plans were abandoned. In 1988, a group of Japanese investors purchased the plans and used them to build this golf course and club house. The project was overseen by Wright\u2019s former assistant, John Rattenbury, and incorporates countless features associated with Wright, such as underground sections and stained glass skylights.\n\nThe Dwight D Martin House, Buffalo, USA\n\nOne of the finest examples of the prairie house style Wright was known for, this enormous property was built for Buffalo businessman Darwin D Martin in 1905. He was obviously keen to keep his family close \u2013 the property\u2019s six interconnected buildings include a smaller residence built for Martin\u2019s sister. Wright created the house as a \u201ctout ensemble\u201d, designing not just the exterior but the interior too \u2013 right down to the 394 pieces of stained glass and the light fixtures. No expense was spared \u2013 gold mortar surrounds the interior brickwork, and an underground tunnel connects the main house with the carriage room. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Wright went three times over budget.\n\nTaliesin, Wisconsin, USA\n\nTaliesin is Wright\u2019s estate \u2013 constructed as his home and studio, and built atop the Wisconsin hill close to his grandparents\u2019 former home. A National Historic Landmark and Unesco World Heritage site, it includes the Frank Lloyd Wright Visitor Center (where you\u2019ll find the only free-standing restaurant designed by Wright), Tan-y-deri, built for his sister, and Hillside, a school he designed for his aunts. And then there\u2019s the main house itself \u2013 a 37,000-square-foot masterpiece which became the longest ongoing project of Wright\u2019s career. Favourite fact: there are 524 windows \u2013 a reminder of the architect\u2019s love of natural light.\n\nFallingwater, Pennsylvania, USA\n\nThis is the property most people think of when they think of Frank Lloyd Wright \u2013 a multilevel, minimalist icon atop a forest-fringed waterfall. Interestingly, Wright\u2019s career was on a downward trajectory when American entrepreneur Edgar J Kaufmann asked him to design his new holiday home. Fallingwater (which, according to legend, was sketched in two hours) was designed to allow its residents to connect with nature \u2013 each bedroom has its own terrace, and a huge rocky outcropping protrudes into the living room. Wright even added a hidden staircase which leads to the stream beneath the house.\n\nJohnson Wax Headquarters, Wisconsin, USA\n\n\u201cJohnson Wax Headquarters\u201d might not have the same ring as \u201cFallingwater\u201d but this Wisconsin masterpiece is no less spectacular. In 1936, American businessman HF Johnson Jr commissioned Wright to design \u201cthe best office building in the world\u201d. It was certainly unusual, with windows made not from panes of glass but from 70km of glass Pyrex tubing. Wright installed elegant, internal tree-shaped pillars which removed the need for interior walls, and used thousands of bricks chosen specifically for their deep red hue. Cherokee red eventually became Wright\u2019s signature colour.\n\nEnnis House, Los Angeles, USA\n\nThe bad news? Los Angeles\u2019 Ennis House was recently purchased for $4.5m (\u00a33.7m) by businessman Ron Burkle. The good news? Under the terms of sale, Burkle has to provide public access to the building for a minimum of 12 days every year. Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and built by his son Lloyd, the Ennis House features blocks of hand-carved textured granite. Don\u2019t be surprised if it looks familiar \u2013 it features in the film Blade Runner.\n\nYodok\u014d Guest House, Ashiya, Japan\n\nThis gorgeous guest house is the only surviving Frank Lloyd Wright residential building in Japan, and it\u2019s been open to the public since 1989. Designed by Wright in 1918 and completed in 1924, the property was built for Tazaemon Yamamura, an eighth-generation sake brewer. Notable features include the wide range of materials (reinforced concrete, mahogany from the Philippines and local Oya stone) and the decorative copper plates on the windows, many of which have stylised leaf motifs.", "description": "This is an important year for fans of the late architect Frank Lloyd Wright: 2019 marks 60 years since he died, and 60 years since his greatest work, the Solomon R\u00a0Guggenheim Museum,\u00a0opened in New York City.
