Trump.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times, Soros said that Warren \"has emerged as the clear-cut person to beat..I don\u2019t take a public stance, but I do believe that she is the most qualified to be president.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m not endorsing anybody because I want to work with whoever,\" he told the Times. \"I don\u2019t express my views generally because I have to live with whoever the electorate chooses.\"\n\nSoros also told the Times that he is proud that so many oppose his interference in politics. \"I\u2019m very proud of the enemies I have,\" he told the paper. \"It\u2019s a perfect way to tell a dictator or a would-be dictator if he identifies me as an enemy.\"\n\nHe also added that he is going to try to alter the course of history to what he claims is the right direction.\n\n\"The arc of history doesn\u2019t follow its own course. It needs to be bent,\" he said. \"I am really engaged in trying to bend it in the right direction.\"\n\nIn this same interview, he told the Times that President Trump is \"is an aberration, and he is clearly putting his personal interests ahead of the national interests.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s a fact,\" he threw in for good measure.", "description": ".10/25/2019 18:00:06PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/117/7d20cf8a-69e5-4929-9725-452756b365d8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
