Although some of these measures have been relaxed, their impact on human rights continues to be widely felt,\" said Colville.\n\nHe said that the undeclared curfew imposed by the authorities in the region was lifted from much of Jammu and Ladakh region within a few days but is reportedly still in place in large parts of the Kashmir Valley.\n\n\"This prevents the free movement of people, as well as hampering their ability to exercise their right to peaceful assembly, and restricting their rights to health, education, and freedom of religion and belief,\" said the UN rights office spokesperson.\n\nThere had been several allegations of excessive use of force, including the use of pellet-firing shotguns, tear gas, and rubber bullets by security forces during sporadic protests.\n\nAt least another six people had been killed, and more than a dozen injured in alleged attacks by armed group members, since August 5, said the UN office.", "description": "The UN human rights office says that Kashmiris continue to be deprived of a wide range of human rights.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/17/99ffb9b7ad6d47dea58add03e224ae52_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
