Close your eyes, chances are you can still picture it. Or variations of it: Pharrell made it his thing for the rest of that year.\n\nThat night, the hat defied the formal dress code of the event, standing out (and tall) in the midst of gowns and tuxedos. It proved to be the best, worst and most talked about fashion moment all at once.\n\nPharrell Williams accepts the Record of the Year award for 'Get Lucky' onstage during the 56th GRAMMY Awards at Staples Center on January 26, 2014 in Los Angeles, California.

The account tweeted both about and as the hat personified.\n\nFast food sandwich chain Arby's humorously asked the musician for their hat back, on the basis it looked like their logo (it 100% did). By the next morning, headlines the world over were dedicated to the impossible-to-ignore accessory -- thereon referred to as The Hat -- revealing derision, confusion as to why he'd want to wear something so big (\"ugly\" was also often used), and, of course, praise for his bravado. Pharrell himself commented on it, tweeting that he was \"def more fashionable than Madonna's grill,\" referring to the singer's bizarre mouthwear for the ceremony.\n\nMore The Hat-related craze followed. Everyone, it seemed, was suddenly obsessed by the giant fedora-meets-blown-up bowler. Pharrell fans and the Twitterati quickly identified it as the Buffalo Hat from Vivienne Westwood and the late Malcolm McLaren's Autumn/Winter 1983 show \"Nostalgia of Mud.\" Then, the Internet found a video for \"Buffalo Gals,\" a single McLaren had released in 1982 with hip hop crew The World's Famous Supreme Team, which featured brown, black and grey versions of The Hat. Just like that, the accessory's iconic status got a whole lot deeper: Pharrell hadn't simply decided to wear silly headgear. He had paid homage to a chapter of fashion history. The Hat had real meaning.\n\nRecording artists Pharrell Williams and Brad Paisley perform onstage during \"The Night That Changed America: A Grammy salute to the Beatles\" at the Los Angeles Convention Center on January 27, 2014 in Los Angeles, California.

Over the course of 2014, Pharrell wore The Hat, in different colors and iterations, at a slew of major events and public outings, including the BRIT Awards in London, the Academy Awards and Coachella. He sold the original brown version just two months after the Grammys to none other than Arby's for $44,100 on eBay.\n\nFor each appearance, Pharrell styled the rest of his outfit to go with The Hat and, we like to think, further elevate it. His uniform consisted mainly of jeans, varsity jackets and boots. The Hat did all the talking -- and remained the main conversation piece till the musician eventually retired the look.\n\nPharrell Williams (C) performs onstage during \"A very Grammy Christmas,\" at the Shrine Auditorium on November 18, 2014 in Los Angeles, California.

Love it or loathe it, the accessory helped to throw red carpet conventions out of the window, particularly for men.\n\nIt arguably helped pave the way for more male celebrities to have fun with their red carpet outfits. For example, Billy Porter's tuxedo dress at this year's Oscars, or Timoth\u00e9e Chamalet's Louis Vuitton bedazzled harness at the Golden Globes.
