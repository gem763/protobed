Nest Mini will be sold at major retailers starting on October 22.\n\nThe Nest Mini is a follow-up to the Google Home Mini, rebranding the smart speaker under Google's Nest family of smart home devices.\n\nThe Nest Mini has the same fabric design as the Google Home Mini and comes in four colors: chalk, charcoal, coral, and sky.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nGoogle unveiled its latest smart speaker, the $49 Nest Mini, during its annual hardware event in New York City on Tuesday.\n\nGoogle began rebranding its smart home devices under the Nest moniker in May and the Nest Mini is a direct follow-up to the Google Home Mini released in 2017.\n\nThe Nest Mini has the same fabric design as the Google Home Mini and comes in four different colors: chalk, charcoal, coral, and sky. The fabric is made completely of recycled bottles, and recycled materials make up 35% of the Nest Mini's overall body.\n\nAt 3.85 inch wide and 1.65 inches high, the Nest Mini is the same size as the Google Home Mini, too. The body now has a built-in wall mount on the bottom to make it easier to hang with a nail or other fixtures.\n\nThe Nest Mini will require 15W of power instead of the 9W used by the Google Home Mini. Google says the increased power will allow the Google Assistant be more efficient and process more actions on the device rather than relying on an internet connection. The device will store the Google Assistant commands you use most often so they load faster.\n\nThe Nest Mini will also have improved sound quality with bass that's twice as strong as the original Google Home Mini. The speaker will have automatic tuning when playing back audio, and will adjust the tuning based on your volume level. Using the Google Home software will also allow you to make calls between Nest devices with a new intercom function.\n\nThe Nest Mini will be available on October 22 for $49 at major retailers. Google announced the Nest Mini alongside its new flagship phone, the Pixel 4, at a special event in New York City.\n\nBe sure to check out Business Insider's full coverage to learn more about Google's latest batch of devices.", "description": "Google revealed its follow-up to the Google Home Mini alongside the Pixel 4 during a special event in New York City.", "authors": ["Kevin Webb"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da54399cc4a0a7acc303c62?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
