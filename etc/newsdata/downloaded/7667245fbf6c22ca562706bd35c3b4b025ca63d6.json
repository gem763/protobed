The company reported that they beat Q3 EPS estimates but missed on revenue with a 3% Y/Y drop. The company's strategic review backs a WSJ report earlier this month that activist investor Elliott Management led by Paul Singer was in talks to settle its campaign if AT&T agreed to a review and board changes.\n\nWe recommended going long T earlier this month, writing that, \"Traders could go long T here or add to existing longs here. Risk to $36 now with $60 as our longer-term price target.\"\n\nIn this daily bar chart of T, below, we can imagine that prices open up around $38.25. Prices tested the rising 50-day simple moving average line last week and are well above the rising 200-day moving average line.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has moved sideways (neutral) since the middle of September matching the price action. A good rally today and strong volume should go far in pushing the OBV line towards a new high.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has been in a take profits mode since the middle of September, but renewed price strength should turn this indicator to the upside again and a fresh outright go long signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of T, below, we can see that prices made an outside weak and lower close. Normally this would be a bearish signal on pretty much any futures chart because of the leverage but on this chart of T we are probably not going to get any follow-through selling. Prices are well above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is pointed higher from its low made back in August 2018. The MACD oscillator is in a bullish mode well above the zero line and its recent narrowing is probably not going to result in a downside crossover.\n\nIn this weekly close only Point and Figure chart of T, below, we can see that prices have been in a long-term uptrend since 2002-03. The chart shows a longer-term potential upside price target of $60.\n\nBottom line strategy: T opened higher and with some of the broad market averages making new highs we have an environment that is ripe for additional gains.
