Here\u2019s How It Works: QuickTake\n\nEU Envoys Agree Delay to Jan. 31: Tusk (9:30 a.m.)\n\nEnvoys representing the 27 remaining European Union members states agreed to the U.K. request for a Brexit extension to Jan. 31, EU Council President Donald Tusk said on Twitter. The bloc\u2019s decision will be formalized \u201cthrough a written procedure,\u201d Tusk said, meaning that there will be no leaders\u2019 summit.\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told reporters the diplomats\u2019 meeting was \u201cvery short, effective and constructive\u201d as he left the room.\n\nWhat Envoys Will Discuss in Brussels (9 a.m.)\n\nEnvoys from the remaining 27 EU members states debate the wording of two separate documents this morning -- a six-page legal decision granting an extension, and a two-page declaration explaining the reasoning. The main points of the documents, drafts of which were obtained by Bloomberg on Sunday, are as follows:\n\nBrexit will take place on the first day of the month following the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, \u201cor on 1 February 2020, whichever is the earliest\u201dThe Withdrawal Agreement isn\u2019t up for renegotiation during the extension period. Note that EU leaders took a similar decision when they granted the previous extension in April, but broke their rule after Johnson\u2019s government, with different red lines, took officeThe U.K must nominate a candidate for EU Commissioner after the extension is granted. However, the wording of the documents suggests that the confirmation process of the British candidate may not be finalized before the end of January, meaning the U.K won\u2019t actually get to have a commissionerThe EU reminds the U.K that it still has the right to revoke BrexitFinally, EU governments warn that the U.K should do nothing which is seen as sabotaging the bloc during the extension period\n\nJohnson\u2019s Different Routes to an Election (8:50 a.m.)\n\nThe European Union\u2019s apparent intention to extend the Brexit deadline to Jan. 31 could yet have an impact on Monday\u2019s vote in the House of Commons. Yet Boris Johnson still looks likely to fall short of the two-thirds majority he needs to secure an early general election. That\u2019s because an extension on its own doesn\u2019t satisfy the opposition Labour Party\u2019s position that it won\u2019t support a snap poll until the risk of a no-deal Brexit is completely removed.\n\nBut over the weekend, another option emerged via a proposal from the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party. They suggested amending the Fixed-term Parliament Act to set the next election for Dec. 9, which crucially would require only a simply majority to pass. The risk for the government lies in MPs trying to attach amendments to the bill, but a U.K. official later indicated such a move could be considered if it loses Monday\u2019s vote.\n\nThere\u2019s a final way Johnson could get his election -- though it\u2019s a longer and untested process, with significant risks. The opposition or Johnson himself could trigger a no-confidence vote in the government, which requires a simply majority to succeed. Party leaders then would have 14 days to form a new government that can win a confidence vote, with Parliament dissolved -- and a general election scheduled -- if all efforts fail.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe to our podcast.The European Union looks set to grant the U.K. a delay to Brexit until Jan. 31, prolonging the uncertainty for businesses and citizens but removing the risk of a damaging no-deal split on Thursday.
