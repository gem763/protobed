More information on his condition will be provided when it becomes available.\n\n\u201cThe driver of car #20 Giuliano Alesi (FRA) was checked and declared fit at the medical centre.\n\n\u201cThe FIA is providing support to the event organisers and the relevant authorities, and has commenced an investigation into the incident.\u201d\n\nThe collision between Hubert and Correa caused significant damage to both cars as they hit the wall again, with Correa going airborne and coming to a rest upside down. The impact was fierce enough to expose Correa\u2019s feet as the front section of the car broke away, leaving him trapped in the cockpit, while Hubert\u2019s car broke into two as the monocoque split from the rear section of the car.\n\nHubert was born in Lyon and started karting at the age of 12, before beginning his single-seater career in 2013. He competed in the French F4 Championship, winning the title that year, and progressed through Formula Renault, Formula 3 and GP3, where he clinched last year\u2019s championship with ART that secured him a place in this year\u2019s Formula Two championship with BWT Arden.\n\nHe was also part of the Renault Academy programme in the hope of reaching Formula One in the near future, and team principal Cyril Abiteboul issued a statement on behalf of the French manufacturer.\n\n\u201cOur thoughts are with Anthoine\u2019s friends and family at this tragic time,\u201d Abiteboul said. \u201cAnthoine was a bright young man. His performance and conduct on and off track was that of a true gentleman and it was a pleasure and honour to have had him within our Academy.\n\n\u201cHe will be sorely missed by our teams at Enstone and Viry. His spirit will remain with the team and we will race in his memory.\u201d\n\nA number of tributes were posted on social media by members of the Formula One paddock, with F2 the chief support series to the world championship.\n\nFive-time world champion Lewis Hamilton wrote on Instagram: \u201cThis is devastating. God rest your soul Anthoine. My prayers and thoughts are with you and your family today,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cIf a single one of you watching and enjoying this sport think for a second what we do is safe your [sic] hugely mistaken. All these drivers put their life on the line when they hit the track and people need to appreciate that in a serious way because it is not appreciated enough.\n\n\u201cNot from the fans nor some of the people actually working in the sport. Anthoine is a hero as far as I\u2019m concerned, for taking the risk he did to chase his dreams. I\u2019m so sad that this has happened. Let\u2019s lift him up and remember him. Rest in peace brother.\u201d\n\nBritish McLaren driver Lando Norris said \u201cRest in peace Anthoine\u201d, while the team added: \u201cIt is with deep sadness that McLaren Racing learns of the passing of Anthoine Hubert in today\u2019s Formula 2 race. The team sends its heartfelt condolences to Anthoine\u2019s family and loved ones, his colleagues at the Arden team, and the entire F2 community.\n\n\u201cThe team\u2019s thoughts and best wishes are with Juan-Manuel Correa and his family.\u201d\n\n2009 F1 world champion Jenson Button wrote: \u201cDevastating news from Spa today, the super talented Anthoine Hubert succumbed to his injuries after an accident in today\u2019s F2 race. Rest in peace Champion.\u201d\n\nFormer F1 driver Paul Di Resta added: \u201cI have no words. RIP.\u201d\n\nCurrent F1 constructors\u2019 championship leaders Mercedes posted: \u201cThe entire Mercedes family sends its deepest condolences to the family and friends of Anthoine Hubert, and his Arden and Renault teams on this tragic day.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s Belgian Grand Prix is expected to go ahead as planned, but the Formula Two sprint race scheduled for the morning has been cancelled out of respect for Hubert.", "description": "Formula Two driver Anthoine Hubert has died after a crash during the Belgium Grand Prix feature race, aged 22.
