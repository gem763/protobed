Some 160 more companies are due to announce their earnings this week, including Alphabet, Apple, Facebook, General Electric and Exxon Mobil.\n\nInvestors are looking to the Federal Reserve for another U.S. interest rate cut this week. Central banks in Japan and Canada also are due to announce interest rate decisions.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury is due to report which governments are deemed to manipulate their currencies to boost exports, a designation that can trigger penalties. A watch list issued in May included China, Japan and Germany.\n\nThis will be \u201cone of the most substantial data and event risk weeks of the year,\u201d said Jeffrey Halley of Oanda in a report. \u201cStock markets and energy will likely be punished should earnings or data from the U.S. or China disappoint.\u201d\n\nThe Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.8% to 2,976.89 and Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 gained 0.3% to 22,867.27.

The Nasdaq climbed 0.7% to 8,243.12.\n\nInvestor attention shifted to corporate earnings as tension eased after Washington and Beijing resumed negotiations.\n\nBoth sides have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of each other\u2019s goods. The 15-month-old conflict has battered factories and farmers on both sides and spurred fears the global economy might tip into recession.\n\nOn Monday, Vice President Mike Pence is due to deliver a speech on U.S.-China relations amid tension over protests in Hong Kong.\n\nInvestors expect the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.25% following signs of U.S. economic weakness.\n\nAlso, markets are watching a monthly Chinese manufacturing indicator due out Friday for signs of whether economic growth is weakening further after slowing to a three-decade low in the quarter ending in September.\n\nOn Sunday, the government reported profits at China\u2019s biggest industrial companies declined by a bigger-than-expected 2.1% from a year earlier in the first nine months of 2019.
