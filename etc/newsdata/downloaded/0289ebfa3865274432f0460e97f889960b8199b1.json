Now we\u2019re turning our Art Club into an interview series in which we catch up with the artists and designers we admire and find out what drives them.\n\nArt director Nikola \u201cNiko Nice\u201d Crnobrnja has worked on some amazing projects over the years, from directing a music video for Jazz Cartier to designing album packaging for Juicy J to art directing the crash test dummy-inspired branding for A$AP Rocky\u2019s Testing. His latest project, a co-working / agency hybrid, has him swapping out his pens and sketchbooks for hammers and hard hats.\n\nAfter emigrating from Dalmatia (a region in Croatia) to Canada when he was just five years old, Niko Nice has kept his families roots close to him. Inspired by how people live and work together in Serbian culture, Niko began building Moonbase, an agency / co-working hybrid with the goal of finding talent and fostering a culture of collaboration. After managing all of the construction work himself, he began another brand: Farba, a construction company that is already booking its own projects.\n\nI talked to Niko Nice over email about his work, how being an immigrant motivates him, and what it\u2019s like to literally build an agency from the ground up.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nHow did you realize that design was what you wanted to do?\n\nI naturally walked into it \u2014 picking up cameras, downloading software, and everything in between. Even as kids, we were making RuneScape clan sites and all that shit, putting random videos up on the early days of YouTube, asking if we can make a video for class projects instead of writing an essay.\n\nWhat was it like in those early days in the industry?\n\nAlthough a majority of the work I\u2019ve done has been in the music industry, I don\u2019t really feel like a part of any industry. Same with Moonbase. It was built in an open-ended manner that will be able to reflect all of our interests in due time. When I first started, though, I was just focused on being good and efficient, making sure I was challenging myself and getting my 10,000 hours.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019m a warchild. Every new day is a blessing.\u201d\n\nHow has your culture / family influenced your work?\n\nIn huge ways. My family, friends, and loved ones are the most important thing in the world to me. For those who don\u2019t know, my background is Serbian. I\u2019m from Dalmatia, to be specific. I came to Canada when I was five from a war-torn region that is barely discussed in history. Although I don\u2019t recall the suffering myself, that was what my parents lived through, and, at the end of the day, I\u2019m a warchild. Every new day is a blessing.\n\nAs I get older, I\u2019m so much more appreciative of our unique culture that we\u2019re privileged to further develop as Canadians. (Side note: so much of our new, still-internal projects at Moonbase are influenced by Balkan, Yugoslav, and Dalmatian elements. I\u2019m very excited to share each one as time goes on.)\n\nHow has being an immigrant impacted your work and the way you navigate the industry?\n\nIt\u2019s one of my biggest blessings. It\u2019s very unfortunate what my family and many others in Niagara and around the world had to experience to become immigrants, but seeing my family and those around me make it out the mud \u2014 and being grateful for their lives \u2014 gives me more motivation than I can sometimes handle. I walked in the rubble of my childhood home. No one can really tell me shit, to be honest.\n\nWhat is Moonbase?\n\nMoonbase is a collaborative workspace and multimedia agency in its current form. We have two locations, both in Niagara (Niagara Falls and St. Catharines) in Ontario. Currently, we\u2019re working on expanding the St. Catharines locations, finding talent, and launching a handful of sub-brands that will work alongside Moonbase. The ultimate goal is a Moonbase Colony, which is basically a micro-city.\n\n\u201cI love collaborating and just putting ideas on the table and refining them through experimenting and conversation.\u201d\n\nHow does it differ from regular co-working spaces?\n\nThat\u2019s just the thing: it\u2019s not a co-working space; it\u2019s a collaborative workspace. All of our members bring unique skills to the table. They all operate as freelancers within Moonbase, but they are also able to contribute to various projects. We do have plans of opening a co-working space as well in the relatively near future.\n\nWhat is Farba?\n\nFarba is a design and build company that focuses on getting the most out of a physical space. Quick back story: when we were building Moonbase, we designed and built everything ourselves. The first location was super small, so we had to challenge ourselves to get the most out of the space. Although the second one is much bigger, we still did the same thing.\n\nUltimately, this gave us portfolio pieces for interior design and smart space construction. We\u2019re just helping all of our friends build companies pretty much. Farba has already gotten a handful of jobs, and there\u2019s more on the waiting list. Farba Job Site gear is in the works as well.\n\nWhat have you learned from creating a physical project as large as this?\n\nI\u2019ve learned so much, bro, from teamwork to problem-solving and budgeting. We would work on digital projects from the morning to mid-afternoon, then get back to work on building Moonbase until like 2AM sometimes. When I stop and think about it, what we actually did in the last two to three years, it\u2019s crazy. All future building will be automated through Farba, so I\u2019m excited to just keep going. Nothing really happened that we didn\u2019t expect, maybe some costs, but after we got started, we just went on \u201cfuck it mode\u201d and reinvested everything.\n\n\u201cI can express ideas and concepts, which is often a more powerful tool than being able to create it yourself.\u201d\n\nHow did you first get involved with A$AP Rocky? What was that process like?\n\nRobert Gallardo reached out to me on Twitter a few years back. He\u2019s a dope creative, and he did a lot of work with Rocky and AWGE (Rocky\u2019s creative agency). I worked on some stuff for the Tyler & Rocky tour in 2015 and then Rocky\u2019s Coachella merch in 2016. That was super lit.\n\nGallardo hit me again last year for Testing. It was very rewarding working on an album at the scale, hella ups and downs. I\u2019m still in touch with mostly everyone at AWGE, so you might see more stuff in the future. I definitely want to get Rocky in the studio with Teddy Walton again as well.\n\nWhat\u2019s your dream project, something you\u2019d love to work on in the future?\n\nMan, so much. I\u2019ve been setting short- and long-term goals like crazy. Moonbase Colony is something that excites me a lot. I grew up with a lot of villager qualities. The way people lived back home was more pure, and we want to emulate that in a modern way with Colony. We\u2019re going to get started in the next year or two and then keep adding for the rest of our lives.\n\nThere are a bunch of internal brands and companies we got down the pipeline as well, and a bunch will be launching relatively soon. I\u2019m very excited for all of those. Moonbase and Farba gear are coming soon as well.\n\nWhat does your creative process look like today? From start to finish.\n\nI\u2019m at the point where I\u2019m confident enough in my abilities and taste to just think of something dope in my head and then make it. I like to make concept and brand boards as well. There are a bunch of people that work out of Moonbase now, too, so I love collaborating and just putting ideas on the table and refining them through experimenting and conversation.\n\nDo you have a favorite tool that you use to create or to come up with ideas?\n\nSketches and quick notes recently have been the truth. The best ideas come so quick that if I don\u2019t write it down right away, it\u2019s gone. So I\u2019ve been practicing sketching shit out ASAP, which changed the game.\n\nWhat software do you use on a daily basis?\n\nPhotoshop. The whole Adobe Creative Suite is a must-have, though. Being able to use a lot of software has opened so many doors. Even if I\u2019m not the best at all of them, I can express ideas and concepts, which is often a more powerful tool than being able to create it yourself.\n\nAny artists you admire and want to shout out?\n\nShout out my brothers at Moonbase and Farba. Shout out Teddy Walton, Slim, and Aaron Bow. Teddy and Slim\u2019s albums are on some other shit. I hope the world gets to hear them soon.", "description": "Art director Nikola \"Niko Nice\" Crnobrnja has worked on some amazing projects over the years.
