The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the internal deliberations.\n\nHours earlier, senior U.S. officials said satellite imagery and other intelligence showed the strike was inconsistent with one launched from Yemen, where Iranian-backed Houthi rebels had claimed responsibility.\n\nIran, meanwhile, called the U.S. claims \u201cmaximum lies,\u201d while a commander in its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard reiterated its forces could strike U.S. military bases across the Mideast with their arsenal of ballistic missiles.\n\nThe U.S. government produced satellite photos showing what officials said were at least 19 points of impact at two Saudi energy facilities, including damage at the heart of the kingdom\u2019s crucial oil processing plant at Abqaiq. Officials said the photos show impacts consistent with the attack coming from the direction of Iran or Iraq, rather than from Yemen to the south.\n\nIraq denied Sunday that its territory was used for an attack on the Kingdom and U.S. officials said a strike from there would be a violation of Iraq\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nThe U.S. officials said additional devices, which apparently didn\u2019t reach their targets, were recovered northwest of the facilities and are being jointly analyzed by Saudi and American intelligence. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, did not address whether the drone could have been fired from Yemen, then taken a round-about path, but did not explicitly rule it out.\n\nThe attacks and recriminations are increasing already heightened fears of an escalation in the region, after a prominent U.S. senator suggested striking Iranian oil refineries in response to the assault, and Iran warned of the potential of more violence.\n\n\u201cBecause of the tension and sensitive situation, our region is like a powder keg,\u201d said Iranian Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh. \u201cWhen these contacts come too close, when forces come into contact with one another, it is possible a conflict happens because of a misunderstanding.\u201d\n\nActions on any side could break into the open a twilight war that\u2019s been raging just below the surface of the wider Persian Gulf in recent months. Already, there have been mysterious attacks on oil tankers that America blames on Tehran, at least one suspected Israeli strike on Shiite forces in Iraq, and Iran shooting down a U.S. military surveillance drone.\n\nThe attack Saturday on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Abqaiq plant and its Khurais oil field led to the interruption of an estimated 5.7 million barrels of the kingdom\u2019s crude oil production per day, equivalent to more than 5% of the world\u2019s daily supply. It remained unclear how King Salman and his assertive son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, will respond to an attack targeting the heart of the Saudi oil industry.\n\nCrude oil futures shot up 9.5% to $60 as trading opened Sunday evening in New York, a dramatic increase. A spike in oil prices could have negative effects for the global economy.\n\nSaudi Arabia has promised to fill in the cut in production with its reserves, but has not said how long it will take to repair the damage. The Wall Street Journal cited Saudi officials as saying a third of output would be restored on Monday, but a return to full production may take weeks.\n\nTrump said he had approved the release of U.S. strategic petroleum reserves \u201cif needed\u201d to stabilize energy markets. The president said the final amount of the release, if any, would be \u201csufficient to keep the markets well-supplied.\u201d\n\nThis Saturday, Sept. 14, 2019, satellite image from Planet Labs Inc. shows thick black smoke rising from Saudi Aramco's Abqaiq oil processing facility in Buqyaq, Saudi Arabia. AP\n\nImages from the European Commission\u2019s Sentinel-2 satellite examined by the AP showed black char marks at the heart of the Abqaiq plant on Sunday, marks not seen over the prior month. Identical marks are visible on the U.S. imagery. The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies in August identified the area with the char marks as the plant\u2019s stabilization area. The center said the area includes \u201cstorage tanks and processing and compressor trains \u2014 which greatly increases the likelihood of a strike successfully disrupting or destroying its operations.\u201d\n\nThe state-run oil giant Saudi Aramco, which the kingdom hopes to offer a sliver of in a public stock offering, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPompeo directly blamed Iran for the Saudi attack on Twitter late Saturday, and officials worked to provide evidence for his claim the following day.\n\n\u201cAmid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply,\u201d Pompeo wrote. \u201cThere is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.\u201d\n\nThe U.S., Western nations, their Gulf Arab allies and U.N. experts say Iran supplies the Houthis with weapons and drones \u2014 a charge that Tehran denies.\n\nU.S. officials previously alleged at least one recent drone attack on Saudi Arabia came from Iraq, where Iran backs Shiite militias. Those militias in recent weeks have been targeted themselves by mysterious airstrikes, with at least one believed to have been carried out by Israel.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi on Sunday dismissed Pompeo\u2019s remarks as \u201cblind and futile comments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Americans adopted the \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 policy against Iran, which, due to its failure, is leaning toward \u2018maximum lies,'\u201d Mousavi said in a statement.\n\nSeparately, Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi\u2019s office issued a statement on Sunday denying the drone attack came from there. Oil-rich Kuwait also said it would increase security around the country\u2019s \u201cvital sites\u201d over the attacks.\n\nHouthi leader Muhammad al-Bukhaiti reiterated his group\u2019s claim of responsibility, telling The Associated Press on Sunday it exploited \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d in Saudi air defenses to strike the targets. He did not elaborate.\n\nIran, meanwhile, kept up its own threats.\n\nHajizadeh, the brigadier general who leads the country\u2019s aerospace program, said in an interview published across Iranian media Sunday that Revolutionary Guard forces were ready for a counterattack if America responded, naming the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar and Al-Dhafra Air Base near Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates as immediate targets, as well as U.S. Navy ships in the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea.\n\n\u201cWherever they are, it only takes one spark and we hit their vessels, their air bases, their troops,\u201d he said in a video published online with English subtitles.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Iran making threats. U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican close to Trump, suggested retaliatory strikes targeting Iran. \u201cIran will not stop their misbehavior until the consequences become more real, like attacking their refineries, which will break the regime\u2019s back,\u201d Graham wrote on Twitter.\n\nWith the U.N. General Assembly taking place in a little over a week, there had been speculation of a potential meeting between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on the summit\u2019s sidelines, possibly in exchange for the lifting of some economic sanctions the American leader imposed on Tehran after unilaterally withdrawing from the nuclear accord over a year ago.\n\nBut Trump seemed to reject that idea Sunday night, tweeting: \u201cThe Fake News is saying that I am willing to meet with Iran, \u2018No Conditions.\u2019 That is an incorrect statement (as usual!).\u201d In fact, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters last week that \u201cthe president has said that he is prepared to meet with no conditions.\u201d\n\nIf Iran had a hand in Saturday\u2019s attack, it could be to bolster their position ahead of any talks, analysts say.\n\n\u201cThe main point for Iran, in my opinion, is not necessarily to derail a meeting between Trump and Rouhani but to increase its leverage ahead of it,\u201d said Michael Horowitz, the head of intelligence at the Bahrain-based risk management firm Le Beck International. \u201cBy carrying out such a major attack, Iran wants to send the message that the only way to decrease tensions is to comply with its demands regarding sanctions relief.\u201d\n\nHowever, he warned there could be a danger of Iran \u201coverplaying\u201d its hand.\n\n\u201cThere will be no political benefit for Trump in a meeting with Rouhani if this meeting sends the message that the U.S. simply surrendered to Iranian demands,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nMiller reported from Washington.
