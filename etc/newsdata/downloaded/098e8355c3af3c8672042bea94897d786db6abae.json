There were a paltry 22 sales of that scale in 1999, compared to 323 last year, an increase of 1,368%, government data showed.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe housing market has undergone a radical transformation, with average house prices in particular almost unrecognizable,\u201d said Simon Checkley, managing director at Private Finance. \u201cTransactions of houses in higher price brackets have soared in accordance with rising prices, creating a much bigger and more complex prime market.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Kurt Cobain\u2019s \u2018Unplugged\u2019 Cardigan Offered for Above $200,000\n\nThe explosion in luxury home sales is notable even when inflation is stripped away. For instance, a \u00a31 million home today would have cost roughly \u00a3590,000 in 1999. But sales of that scale accounted for less than 0.5% of the market, compared to nearly 2% today.\n\n\n\nA look at the past five years also puts the luxury slowdown in some perspective. Even as prices in London and England\u2019s South East slowed, luxury deals of \u00a31 million or more grew every year until a downtick in 2018.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-119686?size=1.3333333333333333&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
