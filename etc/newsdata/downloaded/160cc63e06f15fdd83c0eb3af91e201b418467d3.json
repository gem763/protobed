They weren\u2019t, as the transcript shows: Gabbard and Stein are \u201cboth Russian assets\u201d in Clinton\u2019s telling.\n\nSilly stuff. But haven\u2019t Democrats had enough of the Clintons?\n\nBill and Hillary Clinton are the penicillin-resistant disease of American politics, who have been on the scene since I was in high school. My first vote was against Bill Clinton\u2019s reelection. (If former Libertarian candidate Andre Marrou is wondering: Yeah, I\u2019m the guy who voted for you. You\u2019re welcome.) The Clintons have been around forever, and they show no signs of going away \u2014 why?\n\nBill Clinton was a hero to Democrats in the \u201990s because after being flattened by Ronald Reagan, who was reelected in a 49-state landslide (recount Minnesota!), they thought they\u2019d never win again. In 1996, winning was enough for Democrats.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton\u2019s legacy is, to put it gently, mixed. He\u2019s the Harvey Weinstein of American presidents. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s legacy is not mixed. She was a seat-warming non-entity pretending to represent New York in the Senate, an incompetent secretary of state and a comprehensive failure in presidential politics, losing once to a nobody back-bencher from Illinois and then eight years later to a game-show host from Queens.\n\nShe\u2019s a certified loser, and one who is increasingly out of step with where the Democratic Party is today, from economics to foreign policy.\n\nWhen Lyndon Baines Johnson was sent back to Texas in 1969, he was a broken man. He grew out his hair, let his freak flag fly and then did the honorable thing and quietly died shortly after Richard Nixon was reelected in a 49-state landslide (recount Massachusetts!).\n\nClinton likes a good conspiracy theory, because it sounds a lot less embarrassing than, \u2018Oops, I forgot about Wisconsin.\u2019\n\nBut Johnson didn\u2019t go back to Texas alone. He brought with him a small army of former aides and deputies and advisers and hangers-on, a little brigade of Johnsonites and nostalgists who dominated the Democratic Party in Texas, particularly in Austin, for a generation. They were loyal, but they weren\u2019t very effective. And the last time a Democrat won a governor\u2019s election in Texas was 1990.\n\nThe Clintons are over, but the shambolic Clinton machine remains. The Democratic Party and the media (to the extent that the two are distinct from one another) are full of Clinton sycophants and enablers (George Stephanopoulos, Paul Begala, John Podesta, etc.), and Gabbard was not wrong to point out that many of them are still eager to do the dirty work of Democrats\u2019 ancien r\u00e9gime.\n\nThe party of Tulsi Gabbard has a future. The party of Hillary Clinton has a past.\n\nAs a conservative, I\u2019d prefer a Bill Clinton-style Democratic Party to one dominated by the dotty and fanciful thinking of Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But that is not where the Democratic Party is today, and it is fair for the younger, more left-leaning activists who represent the Democratic Party today to look at all of this endless Clinton psychodrama and ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for us?\u201d\n\nThe subtle blend of fecklessness and vindictiveness that Mrs. Clinton brings to Democratic politics offers nothing except name recognition.", "description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton is every inch the conspiracy theorist that Donald Trump is, and she demonstrated that with her recent suggestion that both Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and progressive third-party presidential candidate Jill Stein are \u201cRussian assets,\u201d part of a scheme in which Moscow and the GOP are tag-teaming Democrats in the 2020 election.", "authors": ["October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/dems.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
