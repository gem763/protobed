With Delivery Unlimited, we\u2019re providing incredible value for our customers and leveraging our unique assets to save them both time and money,\u201d Janey Whiteside, Walmart\u2019s chief customer officer, said in a press release.\n\nThis latest move by the retail giant takes aim at similar offerings from competitors like Amazon (AMZN) \u2014 with its PrimeNow \u2014 and Target's (TGT) Shipt, which provides same-day grocery delivery for orders of $35 or more. Target charges a fee of $14 per month, or $99 per year.\n\nThe retail giant clearly sees online grocery pickup and delivery as a game-changer, amid efforts to expand the popular service across its U.S. stores. The fee-based membership for unlimited delivery is seen as the next step in an evolution.\n\nThe grocery items available for Walmart's service include things like produce, meat, baked goods, pantry staples, and certain general merchandise.\n\n\"As we scaled grocery pickup in the U.S., it unlocked new capabilities like grocery delivery,\u201d CEO Doug McMillon said in his management commentary for the second quarter.\n\n\u201cCustomers love these services, and we\u2019re rapidly expanding them to new locations and testing new options such as unlimited grocery delivery for a fee,\" he added.\n\nDelivery Unlimited was tested in four markets, including Houston, Miami, Salt Lake City, and Tampa.\n\nBy year-end, Walmart expects to have grocery pickup at 3,100 stores and same-day grocery delivery from 1,600, covering approximately 80% and 50% of the U.S. population, respectively. Delivery Unlimited will also be available in 1,600 stores by year-end.\n\nMark your calendar. More\n\nJulia La Roche is a finance reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Twitter.
