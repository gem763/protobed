(AP) \u2014 Kobe Lewis rushed for 161 yards and two touchdowns as Central Michigan cruised past winless New Mexico State, 42-28 in a nonconference game on Saturday.\n\nThe Chippewas lost starting quarterback David Moore Tuesday to an NCAA suspension after he tested positive for a banned substance and now have won back-to-back games under first-year coach Jim McIlwain. Central Michigan has appealed the suspension.\n\nQuinten Dormady stepped up to complete 14 of 24 passes for 134 yards and two touchdowns, hitting Kalil Pimpleton with a 44-yard touchdown pass three minutes into the game to put the Chippewas in front, 7-0. Moore raced 57-yards for a score minutes later to make it 14-0 and his 20-yard dash early in the second quarter made it 21-7.\n\nJonathan Ward ran 75 yards for a score in the second quarter and Dormady added a 7-yard scoring pass to Tony Poljan in the fourth quarter and added a two-point conversion pass to Pimpleton that made it 42-21 early in the fourth quarter.\n\nJosh Adkins was 24 of 40 for 263 yards and three touchdowns with an interception for New Mexico State (0-7).\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
