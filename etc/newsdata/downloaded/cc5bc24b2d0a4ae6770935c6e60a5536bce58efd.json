It said last month that a political transition in which Felix Tshisekedi succeeded longtime President Joseph Kabila in January provided an opportunity to address deep-seated economic challenges.\n\nCongo is a leading miner of cobalt, copper, gold, tin and diamonds but remains one of the world\u2019s least developed countries, largely due to corruption and poor governance.", "description": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) will consider renewing financial support to Democratic Republic of Congo within the next six months, the government in Kinshasa said on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437439919&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF940FQ-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
