(Image: Adam Kubert, Marvel)\n\nAs riveting as Robert Hickman\u2019s House of X and Powers of X series have been, it can be easy to forget that the two comics are only the beginning of Marvel\u2019s larger \u201cDawn of X\u201d arc that\u2019s ushering in a new era of mutant resurgence. Soon, those books will come to an end and make way for even more stories about how Xavier and the world\u2019s mutants are through living in the shadows.\n\nThough Jonathan Hickman himself couldn\u2019t make it to this year\u2019s New York Comic Con, writers Tini Howard, Ed Brisson, and Benjamin Percy joined editor Jordan White and Marvel EiC C.B. Cebulski on stage to discuss the significant developments that are going to unfold in their various X-books launching in the near future.\n\nWhile each of the first wave of \u201cDawn of X\u201d books \u2014 X-Men, Marauders, Excalibur, Fallen Angels, New Mutants and X-Factor \u2014 all feature different subject matter and have drastically different tones, White explained they\u2019re all unified by the fact that mutants are simply no longer dying the way they have been in recent Marvel history.\n\nThe X-Men are back in a big way and Marvel\u2019s using Hickman, R.B. Silva and Matteo Buffagni\u2019s upcoming X-Men series to demonstrate that fact. Cyclops is set to act as the series\u2019 focal point, but the actual roster of X-Men will change frequently to highlight different characters and hammer home the idea that in this new era, any and all mutants on Earth are considered X-Men that may called upon as situations necessitate their involvement.\n\nWhite also explained that the foundation of the Krakoan continent will continue to have a major significance in Marvel\u2019s universe going forward and factor largely into Marauders\u2019 pirate premise that sounded little odd when it was first announced earlier this year.\n\nEven though Krakoa has a number of portals that make it relatively easy for mutants to access from all across the world, the nation itself is still technically an island, meaning that there are plenty of opportunities for the X-Men to get into adventures on the high seas.\n\nIn a video message played during the panel, Hickman and writer Gerry Duggan described Marauders as being the \u201cDawn of X\u201d title that most directly connects to the overall future of the X-Men, which makes a certain degree of sense considering that the book will explore the new position of power Emma Frost has found herself in as one of Krakoa\u2019s major political power players.\n\nEd Brisson and Marco Failla\u2019s New Mutants is similarly Krakoa-oriented but in a slightly different way. Here, the classic team will act essentially as the welcoming committee for any mutants returning to Earth for the first time since Krakoa\u2019s foundation, a concept that makes sense given the steps Xavier and co. have taken to truly make Krakoa the new mutant homeland. The book will be both grounded on Earth and take certain characters into the depths of space, and, Brisson revealed, introduce more characters from both the Young Mutants and Generation X.\n\nKeeping in the theme of resurgence, Howard and Marcus To\u2019s Excalibur is set to revolve around a new team of mutants working with Betsy Braddock, who\u2019s taken on the Captain Britain mantle, in a world where mutants are finally able to create culture in a significant way that they never really have before.\n\nMost of the team\u2019s members are classic heroes one wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see palling around with Betsy \u2014 and Apocalypse, Howard elaborated, was purposefully put on the team in order to go on an adventure of self-discovery that will change the way we see and think about the character.\n\nAs Betsy settles into the new Captain Britain phase of her life, Kwannon, the woman whose body Betsy cosplayed in for decades will finally come into her own as the new Psylocke in Bryan Edward Hill and Symon Kudranski\u2019s Fallen Angels, which will follow the lives of a group of mutants who find themselves feeling out of place on Krakoa. Kwannon will be joined by the new, young Cable and X-23, but it was also announced that the skin-shedding Husk, and the relatively obscure diamond-esque mutant Bling will also be featured in the series.\n\nThe cover of Wolverine #1. (Image: Adam Kubert, Marvel)\n\nLike Fallen Angels, Ben Percy\u2019s X-Force will have more of an edge to it than some of the other \u201cDawn of X\u201d titles, which is fitting for a series that follows the X-Men\u2019s black ops team which takes on dangerous missions that everyday mutants simply can\u2019t.\n\nFrom Percy\u2019s description, the book will be messy and dramatic and see two of its lead characters, Beast and Wolverine, both finding common ground and in other instances, actively working against one another.\n\nWhile Percy didn\u2019t elaborate on what kind of conflict will develop between the two hirsute mutants, the announcement of his, Adam Kubert, and Victor Bogdonavic\u2019s new Wolverine series suggests that whatever happens in X-Force\u2019s pages might lead to Logan going solo to handle business his way when the book drops in 2020.", "description": "As riveting as Robert Hickman\u2019s House of X and Powers of X series have been, it can be easy to forget that the two comics are only the beginning of Marvel\u2019s larger \u201cDawn of X\u201d arc that\u2019s ushering in a new era of mutant resurgence.
