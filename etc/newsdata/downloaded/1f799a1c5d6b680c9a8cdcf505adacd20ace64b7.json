To match Special Report USA-ELECTION/TRUMP-GOLF REUTERS/David Moir/File Photo\n\nThe approval paves the way for the Trump Organization to move ahead with one of its largest investments since Trump took office.\n\nTrump announced the purchase of the 1,500 acre Menie Estate in 2006 and said he planned to create a two-course resort with a 450-room luxury hotel and other tourist facilities.\n\nHe built one course, which is loss-making, but Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd said there was no longer market demand for a large five-star hotel.\n\nThe company sought planning permission instead for 50 rental cottages and to build 500 houses for sale, the proceeds of which could help fund the next stage of the resort expansion.\n\nThe vote by the council on Thursday to back the application is a victory for Trump who bought the land at Balmedie cheaply because it was largely zoned for agricultural use.\n\nAberdeen is struggling with a decline in the North Sea oil industry and Scottish authorities hope the resort will help develop tourism in the area.\n\nAberdeenshire Council said it had received 2,921 valid representations from the public about the housing plan, 2,918 of which were objections while three supported the application.\n\nOne councillor said opposition to the plan was motivated partly by hostility to Trump\u2019s presidency but other councillors denied this.\n\nTrump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd. is ultimately owned by the Donald J Trump Revocable Trust, an entity created by Trump to hold his property assets, the company\u2019s accounts show.", "description": "A Scottish council has approved a \u00a3150 million plan by U.S. President Donald Trump's family business to build 550 houses at his golf resort north of Aberdeen, despite some local opposition.", "authors": ["Tom Bergin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434116213&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0XM", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
