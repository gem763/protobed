REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Climate change activists used a fire engine to spray red paint at the facade of the British finance ministry on Thursday.\n\nThe activists drove up to the British Treasury in a fire engine and sprayed red paint through the hose onto the building, though at one point they lost control of the hose.\n\nAfter the stunt, four activists stood atop the fire engine which had a banner saying \u201cStop funding climate death.\u201d The steps of the Treasury were soaked in red paint.\n\nExtinction Rebellion said its activists had sprayed 1,800 litres of fake blood at the Treasury. The activists also sprayed the slogan \u201cStop funding climate death\u201d on the walls of the building.\n\n\u201cThe Treasury has been frustrating efforts by other government departments to take action against climate change because it cares only about economic growth,\u201d one of the activists, named Ben, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t see that eternal economic growth leads to climate death,\u201d Ben said. \u201cThe red symbolises the people dying now in the global south and also the people who are going to start dying from climate change all around the world if we do nothing.\u201d\n\nThe Extinction Rebellion group disrupted London with 11 days of protests in April that it cast as the biggest act of civil disobedience in recent British history. Iconic locations were blocked, the Shell building defaced, trains stopped and Goldman Sachs targeted.", "description": "Climate change activists used a fire engine to spray red paint at the facade of the British finance ministry on Thursday.", "authors": ["Estelle Shirbon", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436586748&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920O6"}
