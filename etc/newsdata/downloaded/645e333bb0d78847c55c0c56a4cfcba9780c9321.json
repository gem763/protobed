Ali had emotional attachments to her job, especially after recently getting a raise she\u2019d worked hard for.\n\nEven after years of meticulous planning, daydreaming and extreme saving, it\u2019s not always easy for those on the path to financial independence to leave their jobs.\n\nThe Walkers.\n\nFor Ali, who struggled to find the right time (and way) to leave, a lot of her self-worth was tied up in her identity as a worker. She and Alison agreed they could wait a bit more \u2014 so Alison quit in April 2018, right before a trip they already planned to take that May, and Ali resigned in July, but stayed on until September. \u201cIt took a year to feel confident to do that,\u201d Ali said.\n\nSome people enthusiastically leap into this new life, but others are more cautious. And despite having the financial means to call it quits, all of them continued to work.\n\nSee: This couple is one year away from having enough money to retire early \u2014 here\u2019s what they did\n\nFinancial independence gets a lot of attention for being a dreamy alternative to the 9-to-5 job so many Americans have, and not all enjoy. The approach includes frugality and investing, and can take years \u2014 or even decades \u2014 for people to achieve, depending on how much they earn, how they spend and save, where they live and how their investment portfolios are performing.\n\nEveryone needs to consider the same factors when saving for retirement, no matter the age they want to leave the workforce, but so many are undersaved and unprepared for their futures \u2014 sometimes because their finances are stretched so thin even without contributing to a retirement plan (and sometimes because they don\u2019t have access to one at all).\n\nEven with diligent saving for all sorts of scenarios, early retirement doesn\u2019t always work out as planned. The goal may be to travel around the world, or spend time watching their children grow up, but unanticipated life events can put those dreams on hold \u2014 such as when a loved one gets sick or a couple breaks up.\n\nThere are times, though, when life presents the right opportunity to retire early.\n\nJames and Emily Lowery were already on the path to financial independence when James\u2019s company faced restructuring and positions were being eliminated. Emily\u2019s job regularly had layoffs, too. The pair took that moment as a cue to \u201cbuckle down\u201d to accomplish the early retirement part of FIRE.\n\nThe Lowerys.\n\n\u201cWe realized how uncertain things could be so we started turning the wheels on getting to the point where we could leave on our own terms, as opposed to having that decision made for us,\u201d James said.\n\nAlso see: I followed the path to FIRE \u2014 and learned that early retirement is the wrong goal\n\nThe couple, who blogs at Rethink the Rat Race, also had 10 rental properties, and wanted to fill them before they left the workforce. Once they were filled, and a few months after the company restructuring that left some workers jobless, they felt ready.\n\n\u201cWe knew we had enough income from rental properties to more than sustain us, and that\u2019s not including other investments,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to fall into a trap where you try to cushion the numbers.\u201d In August, the two left their jobs, went to FinCon, a conference for personal finance writers, and haven\u2019t looked back.\n\nNot everyone agrees on the magic number needed before leaving the workforce for early retirement. All the necessary factors, like savings ratios and investment strategies, aside, there are people who believe you need millions of dollars to retire early, and then there are some who believe they can get by in the future with just a million, at most. The truth is, it depends \u2014 but it\u2019s always best to err on the side of caution.\n\nThat is what Leif Dahleen, a former anesthesiologist, did. Dahleen, who blogs at Physician on FIRE, had already reached the savings number he needed for him and his family in 2014 \u2014 which would equate to 25 times his annual spending (a baseline many FIRE bloggers use), but he and his family wanted to have 40 to 50 times their annual spending before he called it quits.\n\nLeif Dahleen (right) and the young anesthesiologist who inadvertently helped him pick his retirement date.\n\nThey had attained that goal in August, but it was a coincidence that prompted Dahleen to finally hang up his scrubs. A young man graduating from the same residency program Dahleen attended, and who was from the same small town in Minnesota, reached out about any potential job openings \u2014 and Dahleen saw him as a possible replacement. \u201cI said, \u2018well there\u2019s nothing right now, but let me get back to you\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nWithin a few months, he had talked it over with his boss, the resident was hired and trained and Dahleen left. \u201cI was creating a new job for a young man to come back home, and that is how I knew it was right.\u201d", "description": "These people on the path to early retirement took their time, even when they had the money to leave", "authors": ["Alessandra Malito"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS884_FIREfo_ZG_20191008131423.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
