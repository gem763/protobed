Unconfirmed reports said the deal between the Kurds and the regime would be extended to apply to the whole of north-east Syria.\n\n\u201cAfter everything, it seems that the fate of the Kurdish people [is to be abandoned]. We did everything that we could, we called upon the international community \u2026 but it did not result in a solution. We urged all Kurdish [groups] to show solidarity, but no one listened,\u201d Ismat Sheikh Hassan, the leader of the military council in Kobane, told local television.\n\nThe deal is likely to be a bitter end to five years of semi-autonomy for Kurdish groups in north-east Syria, forced by Ankara\u2019s offensive on the area. Turkey\u2019s Operation Peace Spring started on Wednesday after Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that US forces would withdraw from the region.\n\nTrump had not specified a timeframe for the US withdrawal from Syria, but on Sunday US defence secretary Mark Esper said the remaining 1,000 special forces in the country had been ordered to leave \u201cas safely and quickly as possible\u201d as the fighting between Turkey and the SDF began to threaten US military positions.\n\nThe area\u2019s Kurdish-led fighters, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), have been funded and trained by the US to combat Isis since 2015, finally defeating the militant group in March after losing 11,000 troops in the battle.\n\nTurkey, however, says the largest unit of of the SDF, the Kurdish YPG, is a terrorist group indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), which has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for decades.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to abandon the SDF to an inevitable Turkish assault has been widely criticised even by his staunchest allies as a betrayal of a US military partner which has unleashed to a humanitarian disaster and threatens to sow the seeds of Isis\u2019 resurgence amid the chaos.\n\nOn Sunday, at least 750 people with suspected links to the militant group reportedly fled a displacement camp in north-east Syria.\n\nFrance voiced its concern at the report. Government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye told France 3 television: \u201cI do not know, today, who exactly the people are who fled from the camp; it has been a worry for France since the beginning of this armed intervention.\u201d\n\nFrance has been hit by a wave of jihadist attacks since 2015, many claimed or inspired by Isis, and has expressed concerns that a Turkish assault would bolster the group.\n\nThe women and children formerly part of the \u201ccaliphate\u201d had been held in a secure annexe at the Ain Issa camp. They began to riot and scared away the guards after Turkish shelling struck close to the area on Sunday, said Abdulkader Mwahed, the joint president for humanitarian affairs in the Kurdish-held part of Syria.\n\nThe UK-based monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the number to have escaped at 100, publishing pictures of men, women in black niqabs and small children running through yellow scrubland.\n\nThe camp was home to a total of about 13,000 people, including three suspected British orphans and a British recruiter for Isis, Tooba Gondal.\n\nTurkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s stated goal is to create a 20-mile-deep \u201csafe zone\u201d on its border with the SDF, enough to keep Turkish border towns out of the range of shelling and rocket fire.\n\nHowever, Ain Issa and other Kurdish-held roads and towns south of the proposed safe zone have been hit by airstrikes and shelling. Syrian rebel proxies fighting on behalf of Turkey were pushing south and refused to allow the town of Manbij to fall into regime hands, a fighter with the Syrian National Army (SNA) rebel umbrella group said, reporting that Turkey had begun shelling the SDF-held town west of the Euphrates.\n\nA convoy of 40 armoured Turkish trucks travelled into Syria from the Jarablus border crossing to reinforce the Turkish offensive, another military source said.\n\nSpeaking on Sunday, Erdo\u011fan rejected offers for mediation with the SDF and criticised his western Nato allies for standing by what Turkey considers to be a terrorist organisation.\n\nHe also dismissed the reports of escaped Isis prisoners as \u201cdisinformation\u201d aimed at provoking the US and other western countries.\n\nAbout 130,000 people have been displaced in Syria in the five-day-old operation so far, with at least 60 civilian casualties in Syria and 18 dead in Turkey after counterattack SDF shelling of Turkish border towns.\n\nThe SNA summarily executed nine civilians including a female politician, a human rights monitor has claimed. The umbrella group said it had ordered an investigation and commanders were to \u201ccontinuously supervise combatants on the frontlines to prevent any abuse\u201d.\n\nAdditional reporting by Hussein Akkosh", "description": "Agreement to hand over border towns comes after more than 700 Isis affiliates escape camp", "authors": ["Bethan Mckernan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/011ee19d7ff5bd482f0b11e2d249958fc7ab8c09/0_282_4608_2766/master/4608.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=15050ac0a59878d634f9eedd2e8836bb", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
