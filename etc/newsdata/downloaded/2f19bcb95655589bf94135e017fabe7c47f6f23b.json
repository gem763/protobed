The S&P 500, by comparison, slipped only 7.2% in 2018, and this year sports a 18.8% gain.\n\nIn July, Goldman Sachs downgraded PVH stock to Sell from Neutral, citing challenges for the Calvin Klein brand and slowing growth at Tommy Hilfiger.\n\nOn Aug. 15, PVH stock slipped to an intraday low of $67.41; shares haven\u2019t traded at that level since January 2016.\n\nOn Aug. 28, PVH reported a stronger-than-expected second quarter but lowered its forecasts. Credit Suisse said PVH \u201cdid the right thing\u201d by lowering guidance in the face of an \u201cincreasingly volatile macro.\u201d Analyst Michael Binetti reiterated an Outperform rating and raised the target price to $105 from $97.\n\nCEO Chirico bought more PVH stock days after the second-quarter report, paying $10 million on Sept. 3 for 133,155 shares, an average per-share price of $74.99. He now owns 417,351 shares in a personal account, including 46,694 shares subject to awards of restricted stock units, and 9,427 more shares through a 401(k) account, according to a form Chirico filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nChirico\u2019s purchase is the largest in terms of value and share volume since at least 2002, according to S&P Capital IQ.\n\nIn a statement provided via email to Barron\u2019s, Chirico said, \u201cMy purchase of PVH stock underscores my strong conviction in the underlying value of our stock, which the financial markets are not currently reflecting. Specifically, I believe the power of PVH\u2019s diversified business model, the strength of our brands and the various growth opportunities present a compelling proposition. With our two greatest assets\u2014our brands and our people\u2014I have great confidence that PVH is well-positioned to deliver a long-term, sustainable trajectory of growth for our stockholders.\u201d\n\nIt is the CEO\u2019s first open-market purchase of PVH stock this year. Chirico last bought shares on Dec. 14, 2018, when he paid $955,000 for 10,000 PVH shares, an average per-share price of $95.51.\n\nInside Scoop is a regular Barron\u2019s feature covering stock transactions by corporate executives and board members\u2014so-called insiders\u2014as well as large shareholders, politicians, and other prominent figures.
