I cannot support this act of political vandalism,\u201d wrote Rudd, who said she is also quitting the Conservative group and will sit as an independent.\n\nJohnson says Britain must leave the EU as scheduled Oct. 31 even if there is no divorce agreement with the bloc. But his plan is meeting fierce resistance, including from some members of his own party.\n\nThis week the prime minister\u2019s younger brother, Jo Johnson, also quit the government over Brexit, saying he had been \u201ctorn between family loyalty and the national interest.\u201d\n\nJohnson is seeking a snap election on Oct. 15 as a way to break the deadlock over Brexit, but lawmakers last week rejected his call for an early poll.\n\nHe is due to try again Monday, but opposition parties say they will veto that attempt, too. They want to postpone an election until Britain has secured a delay to the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline, removing the risk the U.K. could crash out without a deal.\n\nMost economists say a no-deal Brexit would severely disrupt trade with the EU and plunge the U.K. into recession.\n\nJohnson said this week he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than seek a postponement, leaving government and Parliament at odds - with no obvious solution.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at: https://www.apnews.com/Brexit\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Embattled British Prime Minister Boris Johnson suffered a new blow Saturday when a Cabinet minister resigned, saying she did not believe Johnson was sincere about getting a Brexit deal with the European Union.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jill Lawless"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/britain_brexit_02499_c0-60-3500-2100_s1770x1032.jpg?b1e1d4ec275563b71befe54e68f5c3322b8d7b2b", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
