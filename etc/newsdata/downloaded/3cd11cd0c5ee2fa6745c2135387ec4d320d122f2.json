Nailed It basically sent me into a spiral of panic and laughter every time I tried to watch it, and this utter bomb of a recreated wedding cake is almost too much for me to handle.\n\nA bride\u2019s friend has taken to Facebook (naturally, where all food-related vents live now) to share a massive PSA about a local cake-maker in the US who presented them with a monstrosity of a wedding cake the night before the big day.\n\nThe cakemaker was initially contacted to recreate an elaborate peacock cake, which had its tail cascading down multiple tiers and fan out into individual cupcakes \u2013 sound stunning, right? Should look a little something like this:\n\nLove it! A beautiful way to share dessert while also celebrating your deep love of squawking birds that scream in the night.\n\nThe cakemaker quoted the bride and her friend $450AUD, considering there were some slight changes to the cake (two tiers, a second bird added) and everyone was in agreement.\n\nBut, as described in the FB post made by the furious friend on behalf of the inconsolable bride, the cake showed up looking like a teenager\u2019s first attempt in Food Tech class.\n\nSeriously, look at this fucken thing.\n\nAnd if you thought that the peacock was bad, check out the other bird. I don\u2019t even know what this one is meant to be but it looks crook.\n\nAccording to the FB post, the cakemaker dropped off the wedding cake in a couple of boxes and basically ran away, which I mean I 100% would too if I had made this cursed cake inside the cursed ovens of the hellmouth. I wouldn\u2019t want to hang around to see them open up this fucked-up dark timeline wedding cake that collapsed in on itself almost immediately.\n\nOh, and the head fell off one of the birds. Three times. (!!!)\n\nEven though they weren\u2019t documented in this mess taken straight from the kitchen in Hades, the cupcakes were apparently \u201cokay\u201d which is a bloody big reach from whatever the hell that thing is in the other box.\n\nMy words cannot do this huge FB rant justice, so please just take like ten minutes out of your day and pour through this post \u2013 it\u2019s so incredible and you can\u2019t help but want to laugh and also cry.\n\nYou know what? If this happened to me, I\u2019d just go out to Woolies, buy a bunch of mud boys and put one on every table, and then take this hellspawn wedding cake and put it on its own table for everyone to laugh at and then destroy. The only acceptable thing to do is banish it straight back from whence it came.", "description": "A bride's friend in the US has shared her anger over a massive wedding cake failure on Facebook, which looks straight out of an episode of 'Nailed It'.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/wedding-cake-failure-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
