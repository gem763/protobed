Florida: a coral snake eating a rat snake while being attacked by a wasp.\n\nEvangeline Cummings, assistant provost and director of University of Florida Online in Gainesville, shared the footage via Twitter and asked for help figuring out just what was going on.\n\nAt one point in the now-viral clip, the coral snake thrashes wildly, either in an attempt to chase off the yellowjacket or in response to a sting from the insect:\n\nUm ok, \u2066@UFEntomology\u2069 and \u2066\u2066@MartaWayneUF\u2069 , I believe I just witnessed a BEE \ud83d\udc1d stinging a CORAL SNAKE \ud83d\udc0d while the CORAL was dining on a RAT (?) SNAKE \ud83d\udc0d and I need your support to process this. \u2066\u2066@UF\u2069 #FloridaBackyard pic.twitter.com/djbJJGxaUk \u2014 Evangeline Cummings (@EvieCummings23) October 17, 2019\n\nA doctoral candidate at the university replied:\n\nYouch! Even venomous snakes don't like yellow jacket stings. Although coral snakes aren't great climbers, I'm sure a free meal was good motivation. The yellowjacket- which also love meat- must have thought they had claim to it! \u2014 Natalie Claunch (@heart2herp) October 18, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how the dead snake got into the rosebush or if it was dead when the coral snake found it. But after chatting with experts on Twitter, Cummings settled on a theory:\n\nSo we\u2019ve now settled on our favorite theory: rat snake was dropped by a hawk or similar and landed in the rosebush. (But the rat snake is somewhat twisted around the branches so I wonder if when I was dropped it was still partially alive and tried to free itself and could not.\ud83e\udd14) \u2014 Evangeline Cummings (@EvieCummings23) October 20, 2019\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?

They are quick tempered and very fast. A Vipers bite will cause immediate pain, swelling and bleeding. The Gaboon Viper specifically, has the longest fangs of any snake in the world.
