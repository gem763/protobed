Ringleader and songwriter David Morris is the son of an Anglican priest, brought up near Tintagel; he\u2019s now an active Buddhist, having recently emerged from a nine-month retreat. His band\u2019s last two albums \u2013 2015\u2019s Tender Gold and Gentle Blue and 2018\u2019s Broken Stay Open Sky \u2013 played like moving responses to the sudden death of his father. Their fifth (and second on the lovingly curated North Carolina independent label, Paradise of Bachelors) appears as a wide-eyed, curious creature, willingly alert to the world.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Red River Dialect: Abundance Welcoming Ghosts album art work\n\nNowhere better is this articulated than on Red River, an ornately produced track full of shivering strings that traces the roots of the band\u2019s name (a Canadian creole language combining English, Orkney Scots, Scottish Gaelic, Cree and Ojibwe). As it explores and criticises colonialism \u2013 \u201cI take the name\u201d, Morris sings \u2013 his voice sways between lushness and anxiety, the lyric simultaneously seducing and disquieting.\n\nFans of Will Oldham will find succour in Morris\u2019 quivering, occasionally out-of-tune croon, which works best in the contemplations of Salvation (\u201cSalvation has a hold / On the mind that is not bold\u201d), and when the lyrics suggest faltering on Slow Rush (\u201clooking for shortcuts, hopping the lakes\u201d).\n\nAlthough it sounds and feels transatlantic, British inspirations flood this record, from its Mabinogion-referencing artwork to its recording in rural Carmarthenshire. A meditation on Wales\u2019 highest peak, Snowdon, is momentous, if a shade over-earnest, Joan Shelley\u2019s backing vocals giving welcome lightness (her recent album Like the River Loves the Sea is a slow-burning beauty). Two White Carp also feels thick with the mud of a familiar river, but the spaciousness in the arrangements of Piano and Blue Sparks, allowing in silence like Talk Talk did in their later songs, lets the spirituality of the songs filter in.\n\nAlso out this month\n\nYet another Alasdair Roberts album, and a profoundly moving one. The Fiery Margin (Drag City) explores Europe through the story of a Nazi prisoner, contemporary politics and peace, medieval mystics on False Flesh, and the death of a child on the shattering A Keen. Welsh-born duo Peiriant\u2019s self-titled LP (NAWR Records) sculpts startling instrumentals from the bones of folk music, guitar delays and deep drones. An odder, sweeter couple are Ralph McTell and Tony Visconti, who join together for McTell\u2019s Hill of Beans (Leola), a luxuriant take on his warm, familiar songwriting.", "description": "Songwriter David Morris brings alternate seduction and disquiet on this worldly album steeped in the British landscape", "authors": ["Jude Rogers"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0d0794ff0df8fe3c1c4d6fd41ffebc222236a40/497_53_1816_1090/master/1816.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2c7af45550066fa8f4115a3cdcc1347d", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
