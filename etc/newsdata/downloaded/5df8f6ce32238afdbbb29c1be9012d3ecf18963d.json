As per a report by CNN, the company opened a new manufacturing facility in the country\u2019s capital, Kigali, earlier this week.\n\nThe company said it\u2019s not just assembling phones in Africa, but also handling the entire manufacturing process from making motherboards to packing in the new factory.\n\nThe Mara X and the Mara Z are Android-based mid-ranged phones priced 175,750 Rwandan francs ($190) and 120,250 Rwandan francs ($130) respectively. Comparatively, there are plenty of sub-$100 phones from Samsung, Techno, and Huawei available in the country.\n\nAshish Thakkar, CEO of Mara Group, said the company is targeting premium customers as of now to offer quality products. He added the manufacturing facility can currently produce 10,000 units per day.\n\nThe CEO told Reuters while plants in Egypt, South Africa, and Algeria, import components for assembly, Mara\u2019s factory is the first one to use locally made components such as motherboards and sub-boards.\n\nRwanda\u2019s President Paul Kagame said initiatives such as this can increase the country\u2019s phone usage, which is currently around 15 percent.\n\nYou can check out the products here.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FMara.jpg&signature=52e6b52e140e3830a30140bbdbd6a634", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
