Forecasters say that while the storm is gradually leaving Florida behind, it threatens the coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas with dangerous wind, rain and storm surges.\n\nHurricane Dorian projected to stay \u2018dangerously close\u2019 to southeast\n\nAs Hurricane Dorian continues moving north, it is forecast to keep moving \u201cdangerously close to the southeast U.S. coast,\u201d the National Hurricane Center reported late Wednesday afternoon.\n\nTropical storm conditions are impacting the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina, the hurricane center reported. The Capital Weather Gang has warned that the severity of Dorian\u2019s impact will be linked to how closely the storm tracks to the coast \u2014 and warned that the Georgia and South Carolina coastlines are particularly vulnerable to storm surge flooding, even if the storm doesn\u2019t make landfall.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said late Wednesday afternoon that the storm\u2019s \u201ctrack is close to and almost parallel to the coast of the southeastern United States, and any deviation to the left of the track could bring the center onshore anywhere in the Carolinas.\u201d\n\nBut regardless of where Dorian\u2019s center goes, the hurricane center said, \u201clife-threatening storm surge and dangerous winds are expected\u201d to be an issue along the coasts of Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia. Flash flooding is projected to become increasingly likely in coastal Georgia and the eastern Carolinas from Wednesday night into Friday, the center said.\n\nFollow the Capital Weather Gang for the latest forecasts.\n\n\u2014 Mark Berman\n\nTrump appearance again spotlights \u2018Alabama\u2019 issue\n\nAs Hurricane Dorian made its way from the Bahamas and toward the U.S. East Coast, President Trump injected politics into his administration\u2019s response twice within a span of 24 hours.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the president tweeted that he was signing an emergency declaration for North Carolina at the request of Sen. Thom Tillis (N.C.), a fellow Republican who is up for reelection next year and who has won Trump\u2019s backing amid a stiff primary challenge. But the declaration was actually requested by North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat.\n\nThen, on Wednesday afternoon, Trump displayed what appeared to be a doctored map during a hurricane briefing with officials in the Oval Office. The map showed a white line encircling the area likely to be affected by Hurricane Dorian \u2014 as well as a black line, not seen on previous maps, intersecting with part of the state of Alabama.\n\nTrump had been sharply criticized Sunday for a tweet in which he claimed, incorrectly, that Alabama was among the states that would be hit \u201charder than anticipated\u201d by the storm.\n\n[President Trump showed a doctored hurricane chart. Was it to cover up for \u2018Alabama\u2019 Twitter flub?]\n\nAmong those pushing back against Trump\u2019s tweet was the National Weather Service in Birmingham, Ala., which tweeted that the state would \u201cNOT see any impacts\u201d from Hurricane Dorian.\n\nAs reporters pressed him for answers later Wednesday, Trump maintained that he had previously been told there was a \u201c95 percent\u201d probability that Alabama would be hit by the hurricane. He denied any knowledge of whether anyone had drawn on the map, saying only, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nA White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u2014 Felicia Sonmez and John Wagner\n\nNorth Carolina governor asks residents to get ready for Dorian, reports death linked to storm preparation\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) reported what he described Wednesday as \u201cour state\u2019s first storm-related death.\u201d An 85-year-old man fell from a ladder in Columbus County while preparing his home for the storm, Cooper said at a news briefing.\n\nCooper said that Thursday would bring a high risk of flash flooding to parts of the state, and he urged residents to get ready and to do so carefully.\n\n\u201cToday is the day to finish preparing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I urge everyone to do so with safety in mind.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Mark Berman\n\nThe threat facing the Carolinas\n\nFrom the Capital Weather Gang: Hurricane Dorian had originally been advertised as a huge threat to the Florida coastline, but it seems more likely now that it will be remembered both for the devastation it caused in the Bahamas, as well as the storm-surge flooding it might bring to the Carolinas. Water levels are already rising along the coasts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. Some locations may see as much as five to eight feet of storm-surge flooding, which will come on top of already high astronomical high tides. Storm surge refers to the storm-driven rise in ocean water above normally dry land.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2018We have not seen a hurricane of this kind in the country ever before\u2019\n\nThe scale of the devastation in the Bahamas was still coming into focus Wednesday, said Theo Neilly, consul general for the Bahamas in Washington. But what has emerged has been overwhelming, with \u201cextremely severe\u201d damage and flooding seen on the Great Abaco island, where the airport and neighborhoods were left underwater.\n\n\u201cWe have not seen a hurricane of this kind in the country ever before,\u201d Neilly said in an interview.\n\nNeilly said that Prime Minister Hubert Minnis, who took an aerial tour of Great Abaco, was preparing Wednesday afternoon to go to Grand Bahama for an assessment of the damage there.\n\nMinnis has said that officials have confirmed seven deaths, but he said that they expect that number to increase. Authorities are not releasing an updated death toll until they can confirm the numbers, Neilly said.\n\nGrand Bahama was only becoming accessible Wednesday to ships and helicopters, Neilly said. He also expressed particular worry that the storm ravaged some of the most populated areas of the Bahamian archipelago.\n\n\u201cOne thing that concerns us and to keep in mind is, Grand Bahama is \u2026 the second-largest population in the Bahamas,\u201d Neilly said. \u201cAbaco is the third-largest population. And a large portion of the economy as well.\u201d\n\nNeilly said he sympathized with people struggling in the wake of the storm, noting that he lived through Hurricane Andrew strafing the Bahamas in 1992. Neilly said that in 1992, when Andrew hit, he was in Current, an island town ravaged by the storm. (Neilly said he believed that \u201cthe damage was so extensive I think about 80 percent of the town was destroyed at the time.\u201d In a Washington Post story at the time, a reporter wrote that most of Current\u2019s few hundred homes were \u201creduced to piles of timber and shattered glass.\u201d)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard,\u201d Neilly said. \u201cI went through Hurricane Andrew myself as a teenager. It just brings back so many memories of feeling isolated, feeling that sometimes the supplies and relief effort didn\u2019t come quick enough.\u201d\n\nHe said these supplies and relief are coming, but he recalled that in his experience, \u201ceverything just seems longer than it is\u201d in the aftermath of a storm. Neilly said officials are trying to provide relief as rapidly as possible.\n\n\u201cMany families, many people have lost all they have,\u201d Neilly said. \u201cSo it\u2019s important we get in there as quickly as we can to provide relief for them.\u201d\n\nNeilly praised the help provided by the United States, noting that the U.S. Coast Guard has been evacuating people from the Bahamas. He also said authorities were moved by the response of big countries along with officials from smaller nations and territories, including Dominica and Puerto Rico, which have been hit by storms recently and are still reaching out to offer help.\n\nIn Washington, Neilly said he has been helping collect supplies to send to Miami and on to the Bahamas. He also said they were fielding calls from the Bahamian diaspora in the United States, seeking information on their loved ones as well as hoping to send supplies, along with calls from lawmakers, other countries and nongovernmental organizations sending support and offering assistance.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine how seriously I take it,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been through it.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Mark Berman\n\nIn Nassau, mounting frustration as many await news\n\nNASSAU, Bahamas \u2014 Family members have gathered at the helicopter terminal of Nassau\u2019s international airport awaiting evacuees from the Abacos islands. Ralanda McKinney, a 25-year-old Abacos transplant living in Nassau, was waiting for news of her parents, who live in the Abacos neighborhood of Treasure Cay.\n\nTheir neighbor who was evacuated with severe injuries had told her that he had seen them at a shelter that was running out of food.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about possessions,\u201d McKinney said. \u201cI just want to see their faces.\u201d\n\nAt the helicopter terminal, Bahamians were becoming increasingly frustrated with the official response.\n\nRayven Bootle, 18, was waiting for word from her mother, grandmother and others in Treasure Cay. She said the Abacos community in Nassau had organized donations of water, food and toiletries but the government was preventing them from taking them there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been days. Dorian is gone,\u201d she said. \u201cCome on, we need to get in.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Anthony Faiola\n\nTrump says \u2018we certainly got lucky in Florida\u2019\n\nIn the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon, President Trump was briefed about the hurricane by officials including acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and Adm. Karl Schultz, commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\n\u201cWe certainly got lucky in Florida. \u2026 We\u2019ll see what happens, but it\u2019s a very erratic, very slow, very powerful hurricane,\u201d Trump said. He added: \u201cIt looks like Florida is going to be in fantastic shape, in comparison to what we thought.\u201d\n\nThe president also maintained that the federal government is \u201cvery well-prepared\u201d for whatever course the hurricane takes.\n\n\u2014 Felicia Sonmez\n\nThey dodged Dorian. Now some Floridians question the evacuation orders.\n\nJACKSONVILLE \u2014 In Jacksonville\u2019s upscale San Marco neighborhood, residents were under a mandatory evacuation order, and many homeowners had wedged sandbags against doorways amid fears that the St. Johns River could flood. But on Wednesday afternoon, the weather was still calm enough that fishermen were lining the bulkhead.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t nothing coming this way,\u201d said Jerome Owens, 57, who was using a croaker as bait in hopes of catching a red fish. \u201cIt\u2019s high tide, and the water is supposed to be coming over, but all we got is some rain showers.\u201d\n\n\u201cMan, my neighbor is home cutting his lawn right now,\u201d added Gary Williams, 66. \u201cAnd if you go to the other side of town, you can probably find people having barbecues in their front lawn.\u201d\n\nOccasional gusts of wind did buffet Jacksonville \u2014 strong enough to blow over the folding chairs being used by the fishermen. But as dolphins fed in the river, Williams and Owens said local officials had overreacted by ordering the evacuation of a quarter million Jacksonville residents.\n\n\u201cThey made too big of deal about this storm, and they should have known when it just stopped and sat over the Bahamas that it wasn\u2019t going to make it here to be anything like Irma,\u201d said Owens, referring to Hurricane Irma, which flooded nearly 1,000 properties here in 2017.\n\nSome residents in Jacksonville Beach, a barrier island along the Atlantic Ocean, also questioned city leaders decision to order such a broader evacuation order. The mandatory evacuation order went into effect Monday morning, more than a day before the storm\u2019s expected arrival.\n\nJacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry (R) strongly defended his decision, noting it takes 48 hours to successfully evacuate a quarter million people. \u201cThis is my third storm in four years,\u201d Curry said. \u201cWe know what we are doing.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Tim Craig\n\nFEMA sends teams across the Southeast\n\nWith the threat posed by Hurricane Dorian seemingly stretching across the Southeast, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, responded by deploying all across the region.\n\nIn a situation report early Wednesday, FEMA reported that it had emergency operations centers established in five states: Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. That expanse covered both the places that dodged the worst of Dorian\u2019s wrath (Florida), the next areas on edge (Georgia and the Carolinas) and then the northernmost state still awaiting the storm (Virginia).\n\nFEMA\u2019s response to some disasters has been criticized in the past, including by auditors in the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general\u2019s office. The situation report provided a small glimpse of how FEMA deployed its resources with the storm\u2019s forecast uncertain.\n\nMobile emergency response support teams had been deployed in the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida and Puerto Rico, according to the situation report. Staging teams were dispatched to Alabama, South Carolina and North Carolina, and other staging areas and field locations dotted the Southeast. There were also other teams and resources sent across these states and Puerto Rico, which had warily awaited Dorian before escaping the worst of the storm.\n\n\u2014 Mark Berman\n\n\u2018One of the greatest national crises in our country\u2019s history'\n\nNASSAU, Bahamas \u2014 Houses torn open. Cars, boats and heavy equipment tossed and crumpled. Whole communities flooded, and flattened. Seven dead, according to the official count, and more expected.\n\nThe government in this nation of 400,000 sounded the all-clear from Hurricane Dorian Wednesday morning, lifting the tropical storm warning for Grand Bahama, the Abacos, Bimini and other battered islands.\n\n\n\nMister Bolter recovers dishes from his son's home, destroyed by Hurricane Dorian in Pine Bay, near Freeport, Bahamas, Wednesday, Sept. 4, 2019.

(Ramon Espinosa)\n\nAs the storm, which slammed into the Bahamas Sunday as a Category 5 hurricane and spent a devastating 40 hours grinding across Grand Bahama, finally lurched onward to the United States, the full scope of the destruction became clearer.\n\n\u201cWe are in the midst of one of the greatest national crises in our country\u2019s history,\u201d Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said Tuesday night.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Anthony Faiola and Maria Sacchetti\n\nIn Florida, relief mixed with sympathy for the Bahamas\n\nDorian arrived offshore of Dayton Beach and its surrounding counties with a thud on Wednesday morning, leaving little damage and rainfall no worse than the occasional storm earlier in the week.\n\nBridges shut down for high wind on Tuesday night reopened earlier than expected Wednesday morning. Shelters reopened less than an hour later. Few cars were on the roads, and few businesses were open. Residents who lived by the beach or in flood zones said it was hard to tell a hurricane was even close, wobbling offshore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rainy day, and that\u2019s about all I can say,\u201d said Eileen Keenan, who chose to stay in her house a block away from the beach.\n\nWith her lights still on, Keenan said her only problem was not being able to get her daily Starbucks because the coffee chain, like many other businesses, shut their doors for the day. But like many, she looked at the near miss and felt sympathy for those in the Bahamas who took the full brunt of the storm.\n\n\u201cWe can joke about it and be like \u2018ugh,\u2019 but you have to be grateful that nothing happened, and we were not the Bahamas. Good god, help those poor people,\u201d said Keenan, 53.\n\n\u2014 Fenit Nirappil\n\nHurricane Dorian moving \u2018almost parallel\u2019 to the southeastern U.S. coast\n\nThe storm has stayed far enough from the Florida coast to spare that state the worst of its wrath, but a more significant impact is expected in Georgia and the Carolinas, according to forecasters.\n\nThe Capital Weather Gang reported Wednesday that the impact could be damaging in areas including Charleston, S.C., where water levels could reach some of the highest recorded, and the Outer Banks in North Carolina, where high winds could lead to damage and power outages.\n\n[City by city forecasts in the Southeast United States]\n\nIn a late-morning bulletin Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said the storm was expected to move \u201cparallel to the Florida east coast and the Georgia coast\u201d through the evening. Then, it warned, the storm\u2019s center was projected to move near or over the coast of the Carolinas on Thursday and into Friday. But even if the center remains offshore, the storm could still deliver a punishing blow.\n\n\u201cLife-threatening storm surge and dangerous winds are expected along portions of the Florida east coast and the coasts of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, regardless of the exact track of Dorian\u2019s center,\u201d the hurricane center said.\n\nThe Capital Weather Gang reported that the severity of the storm\u2019s impact will depend on how closely the storm winds up tracking to the coast.\n\nFlash flooding was expected to become increasingly possible across coastal Georgia and the eastern Carolinas from Wednesday night through Friday, the hurricane center said. And \u201csignificant, life-threatening, flash flooding\u201d is expected in the Carolinas, the hurricane center warned.\n\n\u2014 Mark Berman\n\nThe Coast Guard dispatches cutters to help: \u2018There are still people to be saved.\u2019\n\nKEY WEST, Fla. \u2014 Since the storm began, hundreds of distress calls seeking aid for people in the Bahamas have come in to the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Coast Guard airlifted 19 people on Tuesday from a clinic in Marsh Harbor on Abaco Island to a medical facility in Nassau.\n\n\u201cThe magnitude of destruction is catastrophic,\u201d said Lt. Cmdr. Kristopher Ensley, the captain of the Paul Clark, one of nine Coast Guard cutters heading to the Bahamas to provide disaster relief and humanitarian assistance. \u201cIt\u2019s tragic. We are going there to help. This is part of what the Coast Guard does. We save lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are still people to be saved,\u201d he added, emphasizing that the agency was assisting the Bahamian government, which is leading the response effort.\n\n\n\nAn aerial view of houses in the Bahamas from a Coast Guard Elizabeth City C-130 aircraft after Hurricane Dorian shifted north, Tuesday. (Adam Stanton/US Coast Guard via Getty Images) (Handout/Getty Images)\n\nOn Wednesday morning, several cutters headed to Miami to refuel and load pallets of plastic sheeting, one of the most needed supplies for shelter. The skies were clear, and the seas were still expected to be choppy with the storm roiling the Atlantic.\n\nAlthough the Coast Guard routinely patrols near the Bahamas, especially the nearby areas of Bimini and Freeport, rescuers faced many unknowns Wednesday. Storm surges meant coastal depths were unpredictable.\n\nAerial photos showed that much of the debris landed in the ocean, possibly including parts of roofs, buildings and submerged boats. On a normal day, the charts might show a certain depth along the shore, but with the storm surges, coasts might be much higher, and boats may be submerged under the water\n\n\u201cYou don\u00b4t really know what to expect,\u201d said Ardy Effendi, executive officer of the Paul Clark cutter, who is originally from Pittsfield, Mass. \u201cWe can\u00b4t just push through a lot of debris.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Maria Sacchetti\n\n[A storm chaser went silent as Dorian slammed the Bahamas. He reemerged with a harrowing story.]\n\nIn the Bahamas, the ocean became a bulldozer\n\nWhile millions of Americans waited to see what impact Hurricane Dorian could bring, the storm\u2019s terrifying power was on full display farther south.\n\nThe Bahamas took a direct hit, with nearly three out of four homes on Grand Bahama left underwater. On the island of Great Abaco, the storm left behind a debris field. Neighborhoods were flattened and homes turned to rubble.\n\nOfficials said the death toll had risen to at least seven, but they expected that this number would increase as authorities made it to damaged areas.
