That may feel like a cold opening statement, but it\u2019s important to state just how far the franchise has fallen with this latest iteration.\n\nLast year\u2019s WWE 2K19 wasn\u2019t perfect, by any stretch of the imagination, but it was probably the best game so far under 2K\u2019s stewardship of the franchise. After acting as understudies to Japanese developer Yuke\u2019s, this is the year that American studio Visual Concepts took over sole control of the franchise, with this supposed to be a year of transition, where they nailed the fundamentals and laid a foundation to build upon next year.\n\nUnfortunately, WWE 2K20 is the exact opposite of that, to the point where it\u2019s difficult to know where to start. We\u2019ll begin with the visuals though, whose character models don\u2019t seem to retain anything at all from last year\u2019s creditable effort. Even The Rock, who\u2019s been part of video games for the last two decades, feels almost unrecognisable here. This makes the impressive roster of over 180 superstars feel entirely pointless, because so many are lacking in accuracy and personality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch has been made of the rigid hair physics, but the problems go much deeper than that. Clothing clips through characters at an almost comical rate, while it\u2019s not uncommon for title-holders to store their belts inside their torsos like some kind of horrific magic trick.\n\nOf course, visuals aren\u2019t everything but gameplay suffers just as much. Targeting wrestlers has never been simple in WWE 2K titles, but here it feels comical. We lost track of the amount of finishing moves unloaded on the poor referee, while seeing a dropped weapon burst out of the ring mat like something from the canteen scene in Alien is hilarious and unsettling all at once.\n\nSuperstars struggle to get in and out of the ring, often skating along the ring apron and beyond it like some kind of superhero. Or rolling in an endless loop unable to stand up. After the refinement of WWE 2K19 (which we played again recently for comparison\u2019s sake), jumping into a match of WWE 2K20 feels like a huge backwards step.\n\nThis is made all the worse by a strange remapping of the controls. In previous WWE 2K titles, reversals were mapped to the shoulder buttons but in 2K20 they\u2019ve been switched to the face buttons. There\u2019s no real justification for this given the way other moves are arranged, so it just feels like change for the sake of change \u2013 especially given that the combat otherwise feels very similar, even if it is a lot glitchier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the best things about last year\u2019s game was the impressively presented MyCareer mode, but this year only seems interested in carrying the worst parts forward. Loot boxes (thankfully still only earned with in-game currency) are still the main way of improving your character\u2019s move-set, unless you want to spend more of your hard-earned coins on a new move at a massively inflated cost.\n\nThe skill tree feels like a step backwards too. Set up in a similar way to Final Fantasy X\u2019s Sphere Grid, it feels almost impossible to build your superstar into an archetype; if you\u2019re aiming to be a high-flying luchador type you\u2019ll need to select dozens of attributes between each of the nodes you want, just because there\u2019s no way of looking and planning ahead. The new system removes all the strategy of character creation, leaving custom creations feeling cookie-cutter and bland.\n\nWWE 2K20 (PS4) \u2013 better luck next year?\n\nThankfully, visual customisation remains excellent\u2026 when it works. WWE 2K20\u2019s creation suite is full of layers with which to create your very own larger than life grappler, but the game\u2019s full of so many terrifying glitches it almost feels like special Halloween DLC. It\u2019s not unusual for a character\u2019s head to explode, with eyes ending up on stalks, while people\u2019s hair looks like Darth Vader\u2019s helmet being lowered onto his head \u2013 except it got stuck halfway. You can still download excellent community creations, which makes up for things to a degree, but maybe next time 2K should hire fans to edit the roster from the start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the plus side, if you can get it working, MyCareer does tell a fun story. It follows lifelong best friends Tre and Red, who both dream of making their name in the WWE. The mode starts with them being inducted into the hall of fame, as their stories are told in flashback. You then get to see them rise through the ranks and while everything is fairly predictable (especially since we know how it ends) it\u2019s good natured and views the industry with a wistful enthusiasm. Aside from some PlayStation 1 era cut scenes and woeful voice-acting on the part of many superstars, it does offer enough fun to be worth a playthrough.\n\nWhat\u2019s also definitely worth jumping into is this year\u2019s showcase, which finally focuses on the WWE\u2019s exceptional women\u2019s division, via the Four Horsewomen. It feels like it\u2019s been a long time coming but, despite more disappointing character models, it\u2019s nice to see the growth of the division over the course of the story.\n\nWWE 2K20 may have plenty of features but that does not make it a great game, especially given the terrible graphics and equally horrendous bugs. It\u2019s an embarrassment that it was launched in this state and while a patch has been promised within two weeks (but only after a significant outcry from the fanbase), reviewing what\u2019s here at launch was more painful than the ending to Hell in a Cell 2019.\n\nWWE 2K20 game review summary In Short: After several patches and months of waiting this may, possibly, become a halfway decent wresting game, but at launch this is the gaming equivalent of Doink the Clown. Pros: When it\u2019s not glitching out the character creation suite remains impressively deep. MyCareer\u2019s story has a lot of heart and there are plenty of modes and a huge roster\u2026 Cons: \u2026where almost everyone looks terrible. Horrendous glitches, awful targeting Score: 3/10\n\nFormats: PlayStation 4 (reviewed), Xbox One, and PC\n\nPrice: \u00a354.99\n\nPublisher: 2K\n\nDeveloper: Visual Concepts\n\nRelease Date: 22nd October 2019\n\nAge Rating: 16\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy Lloyd Coombes\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare campaign review \u2013 moral combat\n\nMORE: MediEvil PS4 review \u2013 knight of the living dead\n\nMORE: Plants Vs.
