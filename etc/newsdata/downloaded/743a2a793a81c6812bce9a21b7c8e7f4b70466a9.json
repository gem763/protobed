When you think of the tempo of songs such as Stayin' Alive by the Bee Gees, this can help you do the compressions at the correct speed.\n\n'Doing something is always better than doing nothing.'", "description": "Glasgow-born Lewis Capaldi's Someone You Loved was the most popular song in 2019 which had 100-120 beats per minute, a temp the NHS advises for performing CPR.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/17/19598162-0-image-a-6_1570810536096.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
