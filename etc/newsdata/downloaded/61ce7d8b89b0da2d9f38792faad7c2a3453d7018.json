What does that mean for bad health, rise in obesity?", "language": "en", "text": "Americans are addicted to snacks, and food experts are paying closer attention to what that might mean for health and obesity.\n\nEating habits in the U.S. have changed significantly in recent decades, and packaged bars, chips and sweets have spread into every corner of life. In the late 1970s, about 40 percent of American adults said they didn\u2019t have any snacks during the day. By 2007, that figure was just 10 percent.\n\nTo get a better handle on the implications of differing eating patterns, U.S. health officials are reviewing scientific research on how eating frequency affects health, including weight gain and obesity. The analysis is intended to gauge the broader spectrum of possibilities, including fasting. But snacking, grazing and \u201cmini meals\u201d are likely to be among the factors considered, given how they have upended the three-meals-a-day model.\n\nSTORM AREA 51 EVENTS GET FINAL APPROVAL FROM NEVADA COUNTY\n\nFindings could potentially be reflected in the government\u2019s updated dietary guidelines next year, though any definitive recommendations are unlikely.\n\nFor public health officials, part of the challenge is that snacking is a broad term that can mean a 100-calorie apple or a 500-calorie Frappuccino. How people adjust what they eat the rest of the day also varies. Snacks may help reduce hunger and overeating at meals, but they can also just push up the total calories someone consumes.\n\nWhile there\u2019s nothing wrong with snacks per se, they have become much more accessible. It also has become more socially acceptable to snack more places: at work meetings and while walking, driving or shopping for clothes.\n\n\u201cWe live in a 24/7 food culture now,\u201d said Dana Hunnes, a senior dietitian at UCLA Medical Center.\n\nComplicating matters, snack options are also continuing to broaden beyond the standard chips and cookies.\n\n\u201cManufacturers have tried to tap into Americans\u2019 concern for health,\u201d said Paula Johnson, curator of food history at the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.\n\nBeyond nutrition, health officials should also consider what emotional or mental health benefits might be lost when people move away from meals, said Sophie Egan, who writes about American food culture. Meals can be a time for socially connectivity, she said, while snacks are usually eaten alone. She also noted the growth in snacking may be fueled by the stress of busier lives.\n\n\u201cWho knows how much food is a Band-Aid for those issues,\u201d Egan said.\n\nFor their part, food companies have moved to capitalize on Americans\u2019 love of snacks and stretched the definition of the word. Dunkin Donuts\u2019 former CEO has said the chain\u2019s sandwiches should be considered snacks, not lunch. When Hershey bought a meat jerky company, the candy company said it wanted to expand its offerings across the \u201dsnacking continuum\u201d to include more nutritious options.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHealth experts\u2019 recommendations on snacking vary. Children may need more snacks and to eat more frequently. For adults, many dietitians saying what works for one person might not for another.\n\nHunnes, the UCLA dietitian, recommends sticking to minimally processed options like fruit or nuts when snacking. But she acknowledged the advice could sound like it\u2019s coming from an ivory tower, given the prevalence of packaged snacks.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just there, and they have a great shelf life,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Americans are addicted to snacks, and food experts are paying closer attention to what that might mean for health and obesity.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
