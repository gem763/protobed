Bulone said, as quoted by the AP.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Pendygraft/AP John Pendygraft/AP\n\nDuring the trial, attorneys for Drejka said their client acted in self-defense when he and McGlockton got into an argument in front of Circle A Food Mart, a convenience store in the city of Clearwater.\n\nAs NPR reported, the July 2018 incident was captured on surveillance footage. It began when McGlockton's girlfriend, Brittany Jacobs, began arguing with Drejka, who was upset that she had parked in the handicapped parking space without a visible permit.\n\nMcGlockton and the couple's young son were inside the store at the time. The security footage shows McGlockton exiting the store, walking toward Drejka and pushing him to the asphalt.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Pinellas County Sheriff's Office via AP Pinellas County Sheriff's Office via AP\n\nFootage then appears to show McGlockton moving away. That's when Drejka, a concealed-carry permit holder, draws his weapon while on his knees and shoots McGlockton.\n\nInitially Drejka was not charged in the killing. After several weeks, the case was handed over to the office of the state attorney, who charged Drejka with manslaughter.\n\nA letter written by Drejka's wife was read in the courtroom Thursday saying her husband \"was not a bad person,\" according to the AP. The AP also reports that Drejka's wife claims family and friends have received threats and that is why they were not present in the courtroom.", "description": "Michael Drejka was sentenced Thursday.
