Sources said it needed these programming deals locked in before it could move forward on the new streaming service.\n\nFoxtel needs to balance its costs with the need to have large amounts of content in order to justify charging its subscribers the amount it does \u2013 its residential average revenue per user from satellite and cable customers is $78 per month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA new streaming service will not have the Foxtel name and will be aimed at customers who don't have cable and satellite TV, in the same vein as its sports streaming service Kayo. However, the entertainment streaming market is intensely competitive and Foxtel faces a tough fight against the dominant players, Netflix and Stan, which is owned by Nine, publisher of the Financial Review, the imminent entry of global giants Disney and Apple, as well as a host of already launched players like Amazon Prime Video and 10 All Access.\n\nIts streaming (over-the-top) customer base grew to 776,000 at June 30, including subscribers for Kayo and Foxtel Now, which replicates the broadcast service via streaming. News Corp will give updated numbers for Foxtel at its first quarter results in early November.\n\n\"What we do know from around the globe is that a lot of customers won\u2019t just have one proposition, they\u2019ll have multiple propositions in relation to OTT, so we do think that there is a large OTT market that exists already within Australia that we either are part of or can tap into going forward,\" News Corp chief financial officer Susan Panuccio said from the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2019 media, communications and entertainment conference in September.", "description": "Foxtel and the US media giant, which is owned by Comcast, are almost ready to announce a new content deal, which includes shows such as The Office.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.4123%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/146dd4636da1dad752c6544914c24d0e81e532ed", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
