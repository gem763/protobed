The retreat reports that it operates live-in health centres in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and people living with chronic and terminal illnesses receive diet, exercise and health advice.\n\nMichael O'Neill also founded the Involuntary Medication Objectors (Vaccination/Fluoride) Party, and ran for the Senate in this year's federal election. The party is unsurprisingly anti-vax and not a fan of conventional medicine.\n\nThe Guardian reports a complaint made to Acnc alleges the Misty Mountain Health Retreat's activities don't align with its report, stating that it \u201coperates what is effectively a wellness holiday resort\u201d.\n\n\u201cMisty Mountain Health Retreat's unqualified staff give its clients erroneous advice,\u201d the complaint made by dietician and nutritionist Mandy-Lee Noble, states. \u201cThe clients are at risk if they act on it.\u201d\n\nNoble\u2019s complaint alleges that Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s political involvement was a conflict of interest with health promotion.\n\nWant to go steady?

There is no evidence she has been practising since being banned.\n\nAn Acnc spokesman The Guardian, \u201cThe Acnc takes all concerns seriously and will investigate if there is evidence that a charity has failed to comply with its obligations.\u201d", "description": "Several complaints have been received about the Misty Mountain Health Retreat.", "authors": ["Carolyn Tate"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/957d86b84fdc17dcab0ce40dd1e42401", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
