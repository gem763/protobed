There has been an upsurge of jihadist activity in this border region whose local security forces are understaffed due to a reduction in personnel.\n\nThe national government has been asked to take steps to remedy this deficit but so far no action has been taken.\n\nThe kidnapping of Catholic priests has also become widespread in Cameroon\u2019s two western regions since the outbreak of an armed conflict in 2017 that has resulted in hundreds of deaths.\n\nJust last month two Catholic priests were kidnapped at gunpoint at Ibal village in the anglophone region of the country\u2019s Northwest.\n\nFather Franklin Banadzem Dindzee, the diocesan youth chaplain of Kumbo Diocese, and Father Patrick Atang were \u201ckidnapped late at night on Thursday along Ibal-Jikejem road on their way to the town of Oku in the Northwest Region,\u201d said a statement by the local Catholic church, which called on the kidnappers to release the clerics unharmed.\n\nThe abduction took place on August 15, the Catholic feast of the Assumption, the same day the Bishop of Kumbo, George Nkuo, publicly condemned the atrocities that have been committed in the area, urging Christians to pray for peace for the Northwest and Southwest regions of the country.\n\nIn late 2017, Amnesty International reported that Boko Haram had shifted its base of operations from Nigeria into Cameroon, which accounted for an upsurge of Islamist terror attacks in Cameroon.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "A mob of some 100 militants of the Islamic terror group Boko Haram torched a church in Cameroon, local media reported Wednesday.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
