The 20 best food scenes in film 1/20 Lady & the Tramp Who would have guessed one of the most romantic scenes in cinema would involve two dogs eating scraps in an alleyway? And, yet, the iconic spaghetti kiss from Disney\u2019s 1955 animated film has been oft imitated but never surpassed, as the two pups indulge in an Italian delicacy, all soundtracked to Sonny Burke and Peggy Lee\u2019s \u201cBella Notte\u201d. And, as Tramp proves, there\u2019s no greater act of chivalry than offering your date the last meatball\u2026 Moviestore/Rex 2/20 Babette's Feast Gabriel Axel\u2019s Oscar-winning 1987 Danish film is a visual treat for any self-confessed gourmand. The story sees two pious Protestant sisters offer refuge to a French woman fleeing the political tumult in Paris after the collapse of the Second Empire in 1871. They agree to hire her as a housekeeper, discovering later that she\u2019s the former chef of one of Paris\u2019s best restaurants. When she wins the lottery, she uses the funds to whip a meal to remember for her kindly hosts. 3/20 Hook All the very best chefs know that a dash of pure imagination is key to creating a true culinary wonder. It\u2019s a lesson well-taught in Steven Spielberg\u2019s 1991 classic, Hook, as a grown-up Peter Pan (Robin Williams) looks on in disbelief as the Lost Boys tuck into what appears to be nothing at all. It\u2019s only when he truly believes that he can see the brightly colour feast laid out before him. And what childish feast would be complete without an old fashioned food fight? Sony 4/20 Breakfast at Tiffany's Sure, the 1961 film\u2019s title may be a little misleading. Its protagonist, Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), in reality only has breakfast outside of Tiffany\u2019s, popping out of a cab in the early morning light to peer into the jewelry shop window, all while enjoying a pastry and some coffee in a paper. The moment has still remained the peak of glamour, decades later, so who cares if it\u2019s all a little white lie? Keystone Features/Getty Images 5/20 The Godfather It\u2019s a classic scene that proves to be surprisingly instructional. Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s 1972 film has a full-blown recipe tucked within its elegant drama, as Vito Corleone\u2019s close associate, Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano), offers his version of the perfect pasta sauce. As he explains: \u201cYou start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it; you make sure it doesn't stick. You get it to a boil; you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs. And a little bit of wine, and a little bit of sugar\u2014that's my trick.\" Rex Features 6/20 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory Although the 1971 musical is, as a whole, a sugary delight, it\u2019s hardest to resist the temptation of Willy Wonka\u2019s Fizzy Lifting Drinks, a soda described as so bubbly that it lifts anyone who drinks it right off the ground. It\u2019s no wonder that it was the one stop on the tour that ended up tempting the pure-hearted Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) and his grandfather (Jack Albertson). Now, the real question is: does it come in different flavours? Getty 7/20 Eat Pray Love For anyone who considers pizza to be the true love of their life, Ryan Murphy\u2019s 2010 romcom is a perfect cinematic match. It\u2019s hard not to relate to the moment Liz Gilbert (Julia Roberts) bites into a piece of authentic Italian pizza, during the Naples stop on her global adventure of self-discovery, and declares: \u201cI\u2019m in love. I\u2019m in a relationship with my pizza.\u201d Rex Features 8/20 Beauty & the Beast Although we might not fully be convinced that the grey stuff is delicious, the \u201cdinner and show\u201d approach to Lumiere (Jerry Orbach)\u2019s hospitality is something we could certainly get used to. In Disney\u2019s 1991 animation, Belle (Paige O'Hara) is presented with a whole cavalcade of sumptuous dishes: including beef ragout, cheese souffle, pie and pudding \"en flambe\". And there\u2019s a sage piece of advice to go with it all, too: \u201cIf you're stressed, it's fine dining we suggest!\u201d Indeed. Disney 9/20 Steel Magnolias While there\u2019s been a growing fad of ambitious, unusually themed cakes \u2013 you need only look at the success of the TLC reality series Cake Boss \u2013 there are few cinematic cakes that quite stick in the memory like Jackson (Dylan McDermott)\u2019s armadillo-shaped groom cake from 1989 comedy-drama Steel Magnolias, a spin on the tradition from the American South of having another cake separate to the main wedding cake. And did we mention that it\u2019s red velvet on the inside? REX FEATURES 10/20 Marie Antoinette When it came to director Sofia Coppola conjuring the ultimate image of decadence for her 2006 biopic on the French queen, there was no more perfect treat than Ladur\u00e9e\u2019s famous macarons. Delicate and pastel-toned, the meringue-based confection has long been the speciality of the French bakery, first established in 1862. A new flavour was even created in honour of the film, with the Marie Antoinette offering a combination of rose and anise flavours. Columbia Pictures 11/20 The Hundred Foot Journey Food is often regarded as one of the best ways to understand a culture, and The Hundred-Foot Journey is wonderful for showing the efforts the talented, self-taught novice Hassan (Manish Dayal) goes to in order to comprehend that. During a picnic he reveals he has mastered the five \u201cmother sauces\u201d of French cuisine, and the delicate tasting process that follows demonstrates just how important food is to France. 12/20 Goodfellas \u201cIn prison, dinner was always a big thing.\u201d So much so that the Wise Guys ate better than most people on the outside. \u201cBeyond the Sea\u201d plays in the background as the gangsters prepare their meal: Garlic sliced so thin with a razor blade that it would \u201cliquefy in the pan with just a little oil\u201d, meatballs in a tomato sauce that\u2019s \u201ca little too oniony\u201d, steak cooked medium rare, iced lobsters, prosciutto, salami, cheese, red wine and good Scotch. Maybe crime does pay after all. 13/20 Chocolat There are few pleasures in life more fulfilling than that of cooking for others. In Chocolat \u2013 based on the book by Joanne Harris \u2013 a slow-motion scene where dinner party guests tuck into the feast created by expert chocolatier Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) is full of warmth and laughter. AP 14/20 Pulp Fiction In a world where people seem more than happy to fork out \u00a315 for some mushy avocado on toast, $5 for a milkshake doesn\u2019t seem too unreasonable. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) takes his boss\u2019 wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out to Jack Rabbit Slim\u2019s for a burger, where she decides she wants the \u201c$5 dollar shake\u201d. \u201cYou don\u2019t put bourbon in it or nothing?\u201d a bewildered Vincent asks the waiter. When it arrives, Mia takes a long sip: \u201cYummy.\u201d \u201cI gotta know what a $5 shake tastes like,\u201d Vincent says. He takes a sip. Then another. \u201cGoddamn, that\u2019s a pretty f***ing good milkshake.\u201d Miramax/YouTube 15/20 Julie & Julia Nora Ephron\u2019s feature film based on the intertwining stories of chef Julia Child and Julie Powell, the blogger who rose to fame after documenting her pledge to cook all 524 recipes in Child\u2019s cookbook, is all about the joy one can find in food. It is some of the earlier scenes that capture this best, like when Julia (Meryl Streep) and her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) arrive in Paris and stop at a French restaurant, where Julia is served a sizzling platter of sole. It looked so mouth-watering in the final edit that Ephron \u201cwanted to call up Martin Scorcese and say, \u2018you\u2019ve never shot a fish like that before\u2019\u201d. Rex 16/20 Ratatouille Fearsome critic Anton Ego takes a bite of ratatouille and is transported back to his childhood, where it was a favourite comfort food, in the best scene from Pixar\u2019s wonderful animated film. The detail is superb, from the process of Remy the rat preparing the dish to the moment Ego\u2019s pen falls to the ground as he remembers the power of a favourite meal in evoking memories we thought were lost. YouTube screengrab / Jeugos para ninos / Disney Pixar 17/20 Spinal Tap \u201cI don\u2019t want this, I want large bread\u2026 but I can rise above it, I\u2019m a professional.\u201d The miniature bread catastrophe is a beautiful parody on every self-absorbed rock star to have kicked off over something as ludicrous as the food they\u2019re served backstage. Guitarist Nigel Tufnell sits next to a tray of sandwiches looking baffled as his manager walks over. \"Look,\" he says, picking up a sandwich. \"This, this miniature bread. It's like... I've been working with this now for about half an hour. I can't figure it out. Let's say I want a bite, right, you've got this...\" \"Why do you keep folding it?\" Ian asks. Nigel looks down at the broken bits of bread, then tries again: \"This. I don't want this.\" He throws the sandwich to the ground, disgusted. \"I want large bread!\" Embassy Pictures 18/20 The Help After all the trauma she has been through \u2013 at the hands of her abusive husband and a racist ex-employer \u2013 Minny (Octavia Spencer) arrives at her employer Celia Foote to find a beautiful dinner cooked for her as a thank you for everything she has done for Celia and her husband. You see the care that has gone into it as Celia lays everything out on the table, from a \u201cmile high meringue\u201d to the fried chicken Minny taught her how to make. \u201cThat table of food gave Minny the strength she needed,\u201d the narration explains. \u201cShe took her babies out from under Leroy and never went back.\u201d AP Photo/Disney DreamWorks II, Dale Robinette 19/20 Five Easy Pieces Robert Dupea (Jack Nicholson) just wants some toast to go with his omelette, but the waitress is stubbornly sticking to the diner\u2019s \u201cno substitutions\u201d rule. \u201cI\u2019ll make it as easy for you as I can,\u201d goes the famous order. \u201cI\u2019d like an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast. No mayonnaise, no butter, no lettuce\u2026 and hold the chicken.\u201d Columbia Pictures 20/20 Big Night It was a scene that helped propel a revolution in American dining. Il Timpano, a dish inspired by the notoriously tricky-to-make Italian meal, is the star of a moment in Big Night where chef brothers Primo (Tony Shalhoub) and Secondo (Stanley Tucci) prepares it as the centrepiece for a feast attended by their rival, Pascal. \u201cGoddamit, I should kill you,\u201d he screams, throwing his fork down after tasting Il Timpano. \u201cThis is so f***ing good, I should kill you.\u201d 1/20 Lady & the Tramp Who would have guessed one of the most romantic scenes in cinema would involve two dogs eating scraps in an alleyway?
