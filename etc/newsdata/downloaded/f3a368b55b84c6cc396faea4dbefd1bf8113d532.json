When asked why he was taking on an incumbent who is popular within the party, Sanford said: \u201cI think we need to have a conversation on what it means to be a Republican. I think that as the Republican party, we have lost our way.\u201d\n\nSanford frequently questioned Trump\u2019s motivations and qualifications during the run-up to the 2016 presidential election and called Trump\u2019s candidacy \u201ca particularly tough pill to swallow\u201d.\n\nIn 2018, Trump launched an unusual attack against a then sitting House Republican only hours before polls closed in a primary election where Sanford was being challenged. He made reference to an infamous incident when Sanford disappeared while having an affair during his time serving as governor. Trump \u2013 at the time flying back from Singapore on Air Force One \u2013 attacked Sanford, urging voters to support his rival, Katie Arrington. Sanford lost the primary to Arrington.\n\nIn his tweet at that time, Trump said: \u201cMark Sanford has been very unhelpful to me in my campaign to MAGA [Trump\u2019s campaign slogan \u201cmake America great again\u201d]. He is MIA [missing in action] and nothing but trouble. He is better off in Argentina. I fully endorse Katie Arrington for Congress in SC, a state I love. She is tough on crime and will continue our fight to lower taxes. VOTE Katie!\u201d\n\nThe reference to Argentina stems from an extramarital affair that the libertarian Republican had in 2009 while serving as governor. Sanford, who was married, fell in love with an Argentinian woman, Mar\u00eda Bel\u00e9n Chapur, and went to visit her after telling his staff that he would be \u201chiking the Appalachian trail\u201d. He later described Chapur as his soulmate.\n\nOn Sunday morning Sanford said he will formally announce his 2020 presidential election bid at an event in South Carolina this week.\n\nSanford\u2019s announcement came when the Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace asked him whether he had decided to run for president after expressing interest this summer.\n\n\u201cAre you going to enter the race against Donald Trump?\u201d Wallace asked.\n\nSanford did not hesitate.\n\n\u201cI have, and I planned to announce that back home this week. We had a hurricane come visit us on the coast of South Carolina so that sort of disrupted plans on that front, but I\u2019m here to tell you now that I am going to get in,\u201d Sanford said.\n\nWallace sought definitive clarity.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to run for president against Donald Trump in the Republican race?\u201d Wallace said.\n\n\u201cI am, I am,\u201d Sanford said.\n\nHe then asked Sanford why he was running.\n\nThe former South Carolina governor explained that his campaign was rooted in concerns about the identity of the Republican party.\n\n\u201cI think we need to have a conversation on what it means to be a Republican,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have lost our way on debt and deficits and spending,\u201d he said, later, noting: \u201cThe president has called himself the king of debt.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s attitude toward debt, namely being comfortable with it, \u201cI think is ultimately leading us into the wrong direction,\u201d Sanford said.\n\nWallace responded: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know, you basically have no chance of winning the Republican nomination, so why run for president?\u201d\n\nSanford said: \u201cI think you probably would have said that same thing to Donald Trump just a matter of months ago if he faced the likes of Jeb Bush and others.\u201d", "description": "Trump and Sanford are longstanding political foes with former South Carolina governor saying: \u2018I am going to get in\u2019", "authors": ["Joanna Walters", "Victoria Bekiempis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b37a9c2d95b8ed52ea969af56be42a7468dc13d/0_51_3465_2080/master/3465.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ccc2cdad9e54dfc4bf8ce5cd9c581f86", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
