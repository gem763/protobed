Biden told a group of wealthy campaign donors in Los Angeles Thursday that he would not \u201cpunish\u201d them with tax hikes.\n\nThe remark drew a sharp contrast with his top rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, who are promising tax hikes on the ultra-wealthy to pay for a slew of new benefits such as tuition-free public colleges.\n\nAt the fundraiser in sushi restaurant, Mr. Biden boasted about the small-dollar donations pouring into his campaign and then joked to the well-heeled crowd that they wouldn\u2019t get a tax cut from him.\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t coming. It ain\u2019t gonna come,\u201d Mr. Biden said, locking eyes with one donor. \u201cBut no punishment, either.\u201d\n\nThe jest belied a major contrast between Mr. Biden and his far-left opponents in the race. He is running as a more moderate candidate, focusing on what he describes as the existential threat of President Trump and the promise of a return to normalcy.\n\nMs. Warren and Mr. Sanders are running on socialist-style agendas and promise big structural changes for U.S. government and society.\n\nMr. Biden has enjoyed the front-runner position in the race for months. In recent weeks, Ms. Warren edged past him in polls in early voting Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nShe has made an \u201cUltra Millionaire Tax\u201d the centerpiece of her campaign. The 2% annual tax on fortunes above $50 million that would raise an estimated $2.75 trillion over 10 years. It would pay for things such as tuition-free public college, student debt forgiveness, universal child care and a \u201cgreen\u201d environmentalist makeover of the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the Warren campaign.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
