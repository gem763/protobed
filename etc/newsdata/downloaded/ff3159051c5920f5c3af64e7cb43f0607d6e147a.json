On Wednesday, Muilenburg was answer questions from the House Transportation Committee.\n\nMuilenburg struck a note of humility as he entered the hearing room, saying \u201cit\u2019s important that we remember the lives lost.\u201d\n\nAnd in prepared testimony released ahead of the appearance, Muilenburg said, \u201cwe know we made mistakes and got some things wrong. We own that and we are fixing them.\u201d\n\nBoeing is still targeting regulatory approval for the MAX in 2019. Delays in winning approval have further dented Boeing\u2019s profit outlook, on top of billions of dollars in compensation to airlines.\n\nSenator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican who chairs the Senate committee, told CNBC he intends to scrutinize Boeing\u2019s processes but said he did not see anything that would prevent the MAX from going back into service \u201cfairly soon.\u201d\n\nBoeing has submitted to the FAA documentation on an upgrade to the MCAS, or Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, an automated system that Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines pilots were unable to control.\n\n\u201cI think this plane is eminently fixable,\u201d Wicker told CNBC. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a hopeless cause.\u201d", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg was set Tuesday to begin a two-day grilling on Capitol Hill as he tries to steer the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/d65b0e_boeing-chief-executive-dennis-muilenburg-was-set-two-day-grilling-on-capitol-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
