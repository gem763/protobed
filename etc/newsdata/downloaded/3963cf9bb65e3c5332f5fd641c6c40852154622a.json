So for me to win this fight, it\u2019s not going to do much for me. And if I lose this fight, it looks bad. It\u2019s an interesting situation to be in. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going to go from here afterwards.\u201d\n\nIn a weird way, Dariush believes the UFC is punishing him for pulling out a week before his scheduled fight with Drakkar Klose in July. Now he has to fly halfway across the world to take on a tough, but not very established Camacho.\n\n\u201cThis is a really strange situation for me,\u201d Dariush said. \u201cBecause I was supposed to fight a couple of months ago, I broke my foot and toes, so I had to pull out a week before the fight. I almost feel like the UFC might not be happy with me because Frank Camacho, he\u2019s so dang tough. Like you watch his fights, he\u2019s either in a fight of the night or whatever it is, it\u2019s just brutal. All his fights are brutal, but he doesn\u2019t have the best record.\u201d", "description": "Frank Camacho will be a \"tough\" out, but a win will do nothing for Beneil Dariush.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "George Garcia", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/off-guard-beniel-dariush.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
