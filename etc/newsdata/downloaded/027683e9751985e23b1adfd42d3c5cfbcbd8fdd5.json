Last year, he publicly suggested that soldiers shoot migrants who throw rocks at them.\n\nAlthough Trump eventually backed away from his most extreme suggestions, he also reportedly fired aides and advisers who pushed back against his ideas.\n\nThe story recounts an especially tense relationship between Trump and homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who often found herself in the position of telling the president why he couldn\u2019t break laws and international norms willy-nilly.\n\nNielsen was eventually dismissed, at the urging of the White House aide Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump\u2019s immigration agenda, who reportedly told Trump that many of his officials were wrong to cite the legal hurdles to enacting the president\u2019s proposals.\n\nAlthough Trump\u2019s border wall, the construction of which has now begun after the Pentagon allowed the shifting of $3.6bn in military funds to finance it, still doesn\u2019t feature moats filled with reptiles or spikes, his administration has found other ways to keep migrants and refugees away.\n\nTrump has nearly destroyed US refugee program, experts say Read more\n\nIn a federal court hearing on Tuesday, immigration advocates asked judges to block a key immigration policy that forces asylum seekers to await their court hearings in Mexico, where they are not safe and lack access to lawyers.\n\nIn a report released Tuesday, the advocacy group Human Rights First said that there have been more than 340 public reports of rape, kidnapping, torture and other violent crimes against asylum seekers returned to Mexico under the new Trump policy.\n\nLast week, the administration announced that it would set the cap for refugee admissions at an all-time low.\n\nThe supreme court also ruled to allow the Trump administration deny asylum to anyone who passes through another country on their way to the US, blocking most Central American migrants fleeing violence and poverty who arrive at the southern border.\n\nIn a dissenting opinion, justices Ruth Bader Ginsberg and Sonia Sotomayor said that the policy \u201caffects some of the most vulnerable people in the western hemisphere\u201d.", "description": "Upcoming book details the president\u2019s \u2018frenzied week\u2019 and a tense relationship with the homeland security secretary", "authors": ["Maanvi Singh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1bbfb8853fd9c2432abc55b6777c8f46e318684/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aaa0ef2041fd63a6dbb0aaf611425a96"}
