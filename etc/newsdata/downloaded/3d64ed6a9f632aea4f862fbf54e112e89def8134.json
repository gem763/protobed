USA TODAY\n\nBill Murray is going all in all P.F. Chang's. He doesn't just want to eat at the Asian fusion chain, he wants to work at their Atlanta airport location.\n\nMurray, who just rose from the dead to appear in \"Zombieland: Double Tap,\" told Amy Schumer during an interview on her \"3 Girls, One Keith\" podcast that he was looking to work at the Chang's location in Terminal A.\n\n\"I did fill out an application at P.F. Chang's at the Atlanta Airport, because I think it\u2019s one of the best places,\" said Murray, 69. When Schumer was surprised, Murray continued, saying nonchalantly that the application was \"just to work there.\"\n\nHe's alive!: How tragic 'Zombieland' victim Bill Murray ended up in the sequel\n\nBill Murray is looking for fun restaurant work.

The actor loved his experience playing emotionally withdrawn Don Johnston Jim Jarmusch's 2005 film \"Broken Flowers\" so much that it sent him on a journey to look for a new job.\n\n\"I thought I could not do better than that. I really felt that was the end. I thought 'I\u2019m done.' I was kind of looking for anther career,\" said Murray. \"And nothing came up.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/29/pf-changs-new-hire-bill-murray-applies-atlanta-airport-job/2503507001/", "description": "Bill Murray wants to join the fun restaurant crew at P.F.
