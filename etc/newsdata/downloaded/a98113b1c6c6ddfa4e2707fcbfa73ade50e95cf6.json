I just thought the time had passed that I didn\u2019t get to do that,\u201d Kathy Earhart told WFAA.\n\n\"And I was like, 'OK, I'm doing this,'\" she said. \u201cIf I set my mind to it, I will do it.\"\n\nThe mother-daughter team is working toward bachelor's degrees, and eventually, doctorate degrees.\n\n\"It's a lot of fun. We're competitive in a fun way. So you know, it's 'who did better on this, who did better on that.' So we challenge each other,\" Kathy Earhart said.\n\n\"It's just created a bond that's going to last a lifetime,\u201d her daughter added.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
