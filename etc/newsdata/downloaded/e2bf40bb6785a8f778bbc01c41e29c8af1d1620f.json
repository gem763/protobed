(Flynn had resigned amid media reports he possibly violated an arcane federal law.)\n\n\u201cHe misled the Vice President but he didn\u2019t do anything wrong in the call,\u201d Comey claimed Trump said to him. \u201c[Trump] said, \u2018I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.\u201d\n\nAccording to Russian collusion truthers, those alleged comments form the most convincing evidence that Team Trump not only conspired with the Russians and tried to cover it up, but that the president broke the law by asking his FBI director to halt an investigation into one of his top advisors.\n\nThe memo is cited numerous times in the second volume of the Mueller report to implicate the president for obstructing justice by interfering in the Russian investigation, although Comey\u2019s memo is the only evidence of such an act. (Trump has disputed Comey\u2019s description of the conversation.)\n\nEver since the memo was leaked to the news media by a Comey pal more than two years ago, the American public has been warned how that brief discussion between Comey and Trump represented an egregious presidential power play: Trump, the story goes, was squeezing his top G-Man to stop looking into his campaign for conspiring with the Kremlin because everyone associated with Trump, we were told, was guilty.\n\nBut that portrayal of events was never the truth. The conversation in February 2017 had nothing to do with the Russia investigation, as I\u2019ve written before: Neither Trump nor Congress nor the general public knew at that time that James Comey\u2019s FBI had been investigating Trump\u2019s campaign, including Flynn, since July 2016.\n\nAnd the new report by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) confirms as much.\n\nClearing Up the Timeline\n\nIn June 2017, the FBI concluded that the information in the Flynn memo was unclassified; it instead was marked \u201cFor Official Use Only.\u201d (The team that analyzed Comey\u2019s memos included disgraced partisan FBI agents Lisa Page and Peter Strzok. James Baker, the FBI\u2019s former general counsel now under criminal investigation for leaking classified information, led the team looking into whether these memos were classified. No, I am not making this up.)\n\nBut if the generally accepted interpretation of the Flynn memo\u2014that Trump asked Comey to drop the FBI\u2019s investigation into Flynn for being in cahoots with the Russians\u2014is true, it indeed contained what undoubtedly is classified information. According to federal guidelines, government material meets the classification threshold if it pertains to \u201cforeign government information\u201d and/or \u201cintelligence activities (including covert action), intelligence sources or methods.\u201d\n\nComey and the president would have been discussing a counterintelligence probe which by its very definition deals with threats from foreign governments. It would have pertained to information derived from an intercepted phone call with an agent of a foreign power. It would have disclosed law enforcement activity to uncover how a global foe disrupted a U.S. presidential election with the aid of traitorous American citizens.\n\nBut here is why the FBI didn\u2019t mark the Flynn memo as classified: Trump wasn\u2019t talking about the Russia investigation\u2014and the corrupt chiefs at the FBI who analyzed the Flynn memo knew it.\n\nThe president didn\u2019t find out until March 2017, after Comey publicly informed the House Intelligence Committee that he had been investigating Trump-Russia election collusion for eight months and, in violation of congressional protocol, withheld that news from congressional leaders.\n\nSo, when Comey met with Trump in February 2017 and Trump allegedly asked the FBI director to let the Flynn \u201cthing\u201d go, he was referring to the bogus inquiry into whether Flynn had violated the Logan Act, a centuries-old and never-used statute. Partisan Obama holdovers in the Justice Department concocted the Logan Act accusation against Flynn, ridiculously warning White House lawyers that the three-star general could be subject to Russian blackmail.\n\nFurther, in late January 2017, Justice Department officials refused to confirm to the White House that Flynn was under \u201cany type of investigation.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Comey himself admitted that the discussion about Flynn wasn\u2019t related to the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cI had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December,\u201d Comey said in his June 2017 statement to the Senate Intelligence Committee. \u201cI did not understand the President to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign.\u201d\n\nPushing the False Narrative\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped Comey, the media, congressional Democrats and the special counsel\u2019s office from publicly suggesting otherwise. Comey leaked details from the Flynn memo through a friend to the New York Times in order to prompt the appointment of a special counsel, he told Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) in his testimony after he was fired.\n\nThe resulting article, however, did not report that Trump asked Comey to drop an FBI inquiry into Flynn\u2019s false statements. The Times\u2019 story published May 16, \u201cComey Memo Says Trump Asked Him to End the Flynn Investigation,\u201d rocked the political world. Reporter Michael Schmidt wrote that \u201cthe documentation of Trump\u2019s request is the clearest evidence that the president has tried to directly influence the Justice Department and F.B.I. investigation into links between Trump\u2019s associates and Russia.\u201d\n\nNews outlets piled on the bogus storyline: \u201c[Comey] should come back to the Congress and share with us what he knows in terms of the president\u2019s conversations with him on any of the Russian investigations,\u201d Representative Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) told the Washington Post.\n\nThe next day, Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel to investigate so-called collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians to influence the 2016 election.\n\nComey and other Trump foes continued to stoke the falsehood that Trump attempted to thwart the FBI\u2019s investigation into Russian election activities. Comey upped the ante in a 2018 interview with ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos to promote his new book. \u201cHe\u2019s asking me to drop a criminal investigation into [Flynn],\u201d Comey said of the February 2017 Oval Office meeting. \u201cI took it as a direction. I took the expression of \u2018hope\u2019 as \u2018this is something I want you to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nMueller, too, pushed that narrative in his final report. \u201cEvidence does establish that the President connected the Flynn investigation to the FBI\u2019s broader Russia investigation and that he believed . . . that terminating Flynn would end \u201cthe whole Russia thing,\u201d Mueller (or someone) wrote on page 232 of the special counsel report\u2019s second volume.\n\nThe presidential skullduggery allegedly exposed by the Flynn memo is just one more myth that has been peddled by anti-Trump partisans to bolster a fabricated storyline that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to defeat Hillary Clinton. The media will ignore the obvious truth about the memo\u2014but just like every other example of media malpractice related to this scandal, no mea culpas will be offered. Democrats will repeat the falsehood on the campaign trail next year with no pushback from reporters. Republicans can try to push back but it\u2019s probably too late; the public has already been told what to believe.\n\nWhich is exactly how James Comey and his partisan enablers intended it.\n\nContent created by the Center for American Greatness, Inc. is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a significant audience.
