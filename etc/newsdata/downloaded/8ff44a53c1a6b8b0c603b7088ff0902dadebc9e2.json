At first glance, the two seem to bear little relation to each other. Room, which was shortlisted for the Booker and Orange prizes and subsequently became an Oscar-nominated screenplay by Donoghue herself, is a horror story: the taut, terrifying tale of a mother and son imprisoned together in an 11ft-by-11ft bunker by a man who is both the boy\u2019s father and the mother\u2019s kidnapper and rapist. Akin introduces New York professor Noah Selvaggio, a widower preparing a trip to his birth city of Nice for his 80th birthday, whose plans are thrown into chaos when he is obliged, at the last minute, to bring his 11-year-old great-nephew, Michael, with him.\n\nAtmospherically, the two novels could hardly be further apart: Room is lightless, squalid, oppressive; Akin is set for the most part amid the restaurants and promenades and bright, caressing sun of the French Riviera. But the more I turned the pages, the more evident the similarities became. Noah and Michael are free to cross the Atlantic, change hotels on a whim, eat ice-creams and churros for dinner if they choose (which Michael, to Noah\u2019s weary resignation, does regularly). But the pair are as unable to escape one another as Room\u2019s Ma and Jack. Themes of imprisonment run through both novels, as do questions of what it means to be related. If this book demonstrates Donoghue\u2019s range as an author \u2013 and it does, in spades \u2013 it also shows her circling back to a handful of key concerns. In Akin, she has found a way to consider the subjects of love, freedom and family from a freshly illuminating perspective.\n\nFor Noah, these days, family appears to exist only in the rear-view mirror. His wife died several years back; his beautiful, incorrigible nephew perished 18 months ago on a motel bedroom floor, \u201cveins full of heroin and fentanyl\u201d; his sister soon after that. Further back still, and made hazy by distance, are his mother Margot and his grandfather, a famous photographer who worked under the name of P\u00e8re Sonne. Noah lived with him in Nice until the age of four, when he was evacuated to the US as the second world war closed in. This excursion to France \u2013 Noah\u2019s first since he left as a child \u2013 is conceived as a cross between a sophisticated indulgence (the sort a well-heeled, childless academic can afford), and a trip down memory lane: a means of reconnecting with his admired, beloved forebears, and with a history he\u2019s proud of, but barely recalls.\n\nIf Room forced home truths on us, about parenthood and love, Akin deals with similar subject matter more subtly\n\nInto all this barrels Michael: awkward, furious, phone held up to his face, hat pulled low over his eyes. His father is dead, and his mother is serving jail time for criminal possession of controlled substances. He had been living with his maternal grandmother, but after her sudden death from diabetes complications, his social worker calls Noah. \u201cI\u2019m exploring Michael\u2019s kinship resources,\u201d she explains; if no family member can be found to take him, he\u2019ll be removed into care. The pair, who have never met, are forced together by virtue of their shared blood: a solution that nobody wants, but everybody reluctantly acknowledges is, in the circumstances, the least worst option.\n\nThe path of the generational collision is a well-trodden one, but Donoghue dances along it with customary lightness. Thrown together against their will, as the pair travel around Nice they clash, talk at cross-purposes and ultimately learn from one another \u2013 but Donoghue is far too wise to force them into an unearned happy ending. Rather than love, what grows between them is something more formal and interesting: a sense of mutual respect. Noah thinks to tell his great-nephew about their shared family, but comes to realise, over the course of the book, how little he knows of them himself. In the end, Michael \u2013 clearer-eyed, less nostalgic \u2013 is able to make the leaps that Noah can\u2019t, leading Noah to a deeper understanding of the mother and grandfather he revered. At the same time, the older man is forced to question his assumptions about the nephew he\u2019d loved and then written off, and the slice of society to which Michael himself belongs. Each obliges the other to recognise the limits of his experience \u2013 and the possibility that there might be something worth learning, worth having, on the far side.\n\nIf Room forced home truths on us, about parenthood, responsibility and love, Akin deals with similar subject matter more subtly, but in the end just as compellingly; like Noah and Michael, the books are superficially different, but fundamentally connected. This is a quietly moving novel that shows us how little we know one another, but how little, perhaps, we need to know in order to care.\n\n\u2022 Akin is published by Picador (\u00a316.99).
