A ceramic knife was used in the attack and police are still trying to verify whether he brought it with him or had it stashed somewhere inside. One other person was seriously wounded in the attack but survived. A rookie police officer confronted Harpon and when he wouldn\u2019t drop the knife, shot and killed him.\n\nWhen the story broke, police suggested the attack may have been the result of a dispute with superiors. Things changed Friday morning when a police spokesperson said that all motives were still being considered. Friday afternoon, police released a brief statement that said anti-terrorism prosecutors had been put in charge of the investigation.\n\nThe office announced the decision in a two-line statement and provided no details about the evidence that persuaded prosecutors a terror investigation was warranted. David Le Bars, head of the Union of National Police Commissioners, told French broadcaster BFM TV it came from easily accessible sources found in a search of the attacker\u2019s home. \u201cWe knew that searching through his computer histories, the websites visited, his relations, we would quickly have some information,\u201d Le Bars said\u2026 Authorities said the attacker had worked for the Paris police force since 2003, didn\u2019t have a history of psychiatric problems, and converted to Islam 18 months ago.\n\nWhatever information the police have gathered from the search of the attacker\u2019s computer and phone, they haven\u2019t shared it yet. In previous terror attacks, the attacker often announces his motive during the attack, i.e. by shouting \u201cAllahu Ackbar.\u201d However, the Guardian reports there are no witnesses left to what happened when the attack began:\n\nThere were no surviving witnesses from the room where he first attacked and killed three officers, so it is not clear what he may have said to them before the attack.\n\nThe BBC does have one interesting detail that I don\u2019t see being reported anywhere else:\n\nHe converted to Islam 18 months ago, according to reports, and had recently stopped talking to female colleagues in the office. But a government spokeswoman said on Friday morning that there was no indication he had been radicalised before the attack.\n\nThat seems odd and also contradicts public statements that no one had noticed any changes in his behavior. We\u2019ll have to wait for more information to know definitively what happened here, but for the moment it\u2019s looking possible this was a terror attack.", "description": "\"He converted to Islam 18 months ago...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Paris-police-headquarters.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
