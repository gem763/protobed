He said Styles saw him sleeping on a bus stop bench, offered him cash and invited him to \"have some fun\" at a hotel.\n\nStyles denied ever saying that.\n\nInstead, he testified, a stalking campaign began, describing how Tarazaga-Orero camped outside his home for two months, followed him to his local pub, and tried to grab him while he was running in Regents Park. Styles reported Tarazaga-Orero to police in June.\n\nA representative of Styles did not immediately respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY.", "description": "A homeless man was convicted of stalking Harry Styles for months after the star bought him some food, according to reports.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/21/USAT/e4be4acd-729d-4164-8fc5-95ec965066da-GTY_1147408776.JPG?crop=4127,2321,x0,y1&width=3200&height=2131&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
