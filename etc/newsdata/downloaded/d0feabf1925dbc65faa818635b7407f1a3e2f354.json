Hopefully by tonight we\u2019ll have a sense of [Dorian\u2019s] movement, and once we see the definitive movement north that\u2019s going to allow us to even more concisely identify the places along Florida\u2019s coast that are most at risk.\u201d\n\nDorian has already left a trail of \u201cunprecedented destruction\u201d during its slow two-day crawl through Abaco Island and Grand Bahama, in the archipelago off Florida\u2019s south-east coast.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A road is flooded during the passing of Hurricane Dorian in Freeport, Grand Bahama.

Our focus right now is rescue, recovery and prayer.\u201d\n\nResidents in the Bahamas shared videos on social media showing scenes of catastrophic winds, torrential rain and flooding. There were also unconfirmed reports of bodies seen in Abaco that officials said first responders would investigate when conditions allowed.\n\nAfter parking itself over Grand Bahama for almost nine hours on Monday, Dorian was expected to pick up speed overnight and move north-west towards Florida\u2019s east coast, then turn north on a path closer to Georgia and the Carolinas by midweek.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A lifeguard tower is removed in preparation for Hurricane Dorian as the storm approaches the Florida coast on Saturday.

Hurricane Matthew in 2016 followed a similar offshore track to Dorian\u2019s expected path yet still caused hundreds of billions of dollars of damage in the US and 47 deaths.\n\nIn 2017 Irma and Maria ripped through the Caribbean, the latter blamed for more than 3,000 deaths in Puerto Rico. Last year\u2019s Hurricane Michael wrecked areas of the Florida Panhandle that are still struggling to recover.\n\nThere is growing evidence that the climate crisis, through the warming of the atmosphere and higher sea temperatures, is contributing to a pattern of fiercer, more destructive hurricanes.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence announced that the Royal Fleet Auxiliary support vessel Mounts Bay, which has been in Caribbean since June, would shortly arrive in the Bahamas to help with recovery efforts.", "description": "Officials in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas on Monday issued mandatory evacuation orders as 155mph winds batter Bahamas", "authors": ["Richard Luscombe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a980f76b4feb8998dee69708ff1712cf4afcd9f/0_52_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b5cdb2602808f014dd97718272acfada"}
