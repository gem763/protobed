Bush, who led the United States into war across the Middle East, attacked President Trump on Wednesday night, saying U.S. intervention is necessary \u201cfor the sake of peace\u201d around the globe.\n\nDuring a panel alongside former President Bill Clinton at the Nir School of the Heart, Bush laid into Trump for his recent decision to withdraw up to 1,000 American troops from northeast Syria \u2014 fulfilling his longheld campaign promise to bring troops home after more than a decade of war.\n\n\u201cAn isolationist United States is destabilizing around the world,\u201d Bush said, according to the Washington Post\u2018s Josh Rogin. \u201cWe are becoming isolationist and that\u2019s dangerous for the sake of peace.\u201d\n\nBush led the U.S. into war in Afghanistan and Iraq with more than 4,500 Americans dying in Iraq \u2014 including more than 3,500 killed in combat \u2014 and up to 205,000 Iraqi citizens dying in the war since March 2003.\n\nIn total, Bush\u2019s post-9/11 wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and intervention in Pakistan have resulted in the deaths of between 480,000 and 507,000 people \u2014 including nearly 7,000 American soldiers who had deployed to the regions.\n\nToday, the overwhelming majority of American Veterans and all U.S. voters say that Bush\u2019s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were \u201cnot worth fighting\u201d more than a decade later, the latest Pew Research Center survey finds. Likewise, nearly six-in-ten voters say U.S. military intervention in Syria is not worth fighting or risking American lives.\n\nBush, according to Rogin, also said his biggest regret as president from 2001 to 2008 was not passing an amnesty for the 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S., seemingly attacking the Trump administration\u2019s focus on enforcement of immigration law that has helped boost wages for blue-collar and working-class Americans.\n\n\u201cWe are a nation of immigrants but the language coming out of the system today is rejecting immigration,\u201d Bush said.\n\nDuring his two terms in office, Bush\u2019s immigration platform centered on his \u201cany willing worker\u201d policy that declared all foreign nationals were welcome to come to the U.S. so long as they took American jobs, which were already scarce during the Great Recession and the aftermath of natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita.\n\nBush\u2019s continued attacks on Trump and his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda stand in contrast to the former president\u2019s history of refusing to denounce the far-left policies of Obama.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for the country to have a former president undermine a current president,\u201d Bush said in 2014. \u201cI think it\u2019s bad for the presidency for that matter.\u201d\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
