We thank the administration for their support enabling this opportunity,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.\n\nIn June, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was considering moving Mac Pro production \u2014 the last major product it assembles in the U.S. \u2014 to China in order to be closer to its suppliers.\n\nTrump threatens new 10% tariffs on China\n\nApple has perhaps the greatest exposure to U.S.-Chinese trade relations. In August, it got a reprieve when the White House pushed back until December 15 a proposed 10% levy on phones and other electronic devices imported from China.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives described Apple's decision to keep Mac Pro production in the U.S. as a \"poker move.\"\n\n\"This is an example of smart and strategic balanced production from Apple and should be viewed as a move in good faith as we head into the December 15th possibility of the additional 10% tariff on the $300 billion of Chinese goods,\" he said in a note.\n\nApple is reportedly considering moving up to one-third of its production out of China to low-cost countries like India and Vietnam. That wouldn't be easy, however \u2014 experts says that moving just 20% of its production out of Shenzhen on Chinas' mainland near Hong Kong would take at least three years to execute.\n\nApple still manufactures its other top-selling products, like iPhones, iPads and MacBooks, in Shenzhen. The Mac Pro is not one of the company's best-selling products, though it is one of the most expensive, starting at $6,000.", "description": "CEO Tim Cook thanks Trump administration after receiving tariff exemptions for Chinese-made components", "authors": ["Sarah Min"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/23/14295e65-92d4-48b3-a52f-6f5226e4b9d5/thumbnail/1200x630/a4b6d4d02a1f7e97d705734e0140e229/gettyimages-1147874558.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
