She hosted lively parties, including one at which she first declared her love for Tom Hiddleston, the British actor with whom she briefly stepped out, during which Tom was snapped on the local beach wearing a cringeworthy \u2018I heart TS\u2019 vest.\n\nAs it happened, the singer soon grew bored of both Tom and her house and now spends little time enjoying the hot tub from which she used to post endless pictures on Instagram.\n\nSo the \u2018old money\u2019 patrons of Ocean House can rest easy in their wicker chairs overlooking the croquet lawn, reflecting thankfully that the place doesn\u2019t really cater for the likes of Miss Swift \u2014 although it has always attracted famous names, from Groucho Marx and Albert Einstein to, latterly, Hugh Jackman and Elizabeth Hurley.\n\nIt is a sprawling, butter-hued building that rises above the bluffs of Watch Hill, just a 90-minute drive from Boston, so it\u2019s popular with frazzled city workers looking for a spot of R&R (although their laptops are never more than a few steps away).\n\nTaylor Swift has a property portfolio almost as long as her list of former lovers, paid \u00a315 million for the ten-bedroom house on Rhode Island\n\nWhat\u2019s especially fascinating is that in 2003 it was completely rebuilt by a local tycoon, with painstaking attention to the original details. Thousands of bricks were restored and 5,000 artefacts salvaged. The walls are now filled with beautiful artworks including many sketches by Ludwig Bemelmans, best known for illustrating the Madeline French children\u2019s picture books.\n\nThe bedrooms, decorated in sunny yellows and blues, have every touch a Boston entrepreneur might expect: TV over the bath, rain showers, iPads, a Nespresso machine. The only difference from a city loft conversion is that you\u2019re lulled by the sound of waves crashing on the shore while you\u2019re tucked up in your four-poster bed.\n\nIf you fancy a drive, pop behind the wheel of one of the management\u2019s four Mercedes convertibles. Very trusting \u2014 although I decided a taxi might have been better after it took me 20 minutes of wrestling with the sat-nav to navigate back from a nearby shopping mall.\n\nIf the ocean beckons, the hotel will summon a local operator, Barton & Grey, to provide a beautiful yacht, all brass and mahogany, to sail you around the peninsula, with chilled ros\u00e9 and jovial insights from the captain.\n\nThese quips tend to centre on the vast holiday homes owned by wealthy summer visitors. Some of the houses have become increasingly elaborate.\n\n\u2018The bigger the house, the less it\u2019s used,\u2019 the captain observed wryly, pointing out something enormous owned by a financier who was never there. Apparently, this fellow had \u2018I\u2019d rather be working\u2019 chiselled on a rock overlooking the ocean. Of course, New England has long been associated with autumn, when the Fall of the foliage produces those wonderful colours \u2014 but there is masses of appeal in summer, too.\n\nBesides Rhode Island, New England consists of Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Vermont, plus the enduringly fashionable islands of Martha\u2019s Vineyard and Nantucket. I was particularly keen to return to Nantucket, which I last visited 20 years ago.\n\nIt\u2019s an hour from Cape Cod on the high-speed ferry from Hyannis Port (get in the queue early to grab front seats for the best view), and the size of Manhattan but with a fraction of the population, although in summer it rises from 10,000 to 50,000.\n\nPrompted by a recent reading of Herman Melville\u2019s epic American novel Moby-Dick, I was keen to learn more about whaling, an industry which by the mid-19th century had become the islanders\u2019 main source of wealth.\n\nThe local residents revealed that Donald Trump reportedly tried to build a golf course on Nantucket island but told he was 'not welcome'\n\nWith their husbands gone for up to four years at a time, the wives became their family\u2019s chief breadwinners. Some even gained unprecedented legal rights over property (a precursor of today\u2019s power of attorney) while their husbands were away.\n\nA few hours at the island\u2019s Whaling Museum (dominated by a huge skeleton of a sperm whale) rewarded me with an insight into why catching whales had played a major role in female emancipation, given that in the mid 1800s this was the only place in the U.S. effectively run by women.\n\nYou can still go on whaling expeditions, though armed with a camera rather than a harpoon. Whales are attracted to the area by nutrient-rich seas in summer, and on a boat trip to the mouth of Massachusetts Bay we spotted minke and humpback whales, along with dolphins, seals and a lone basking shark.\n\nYou can still go on whaling expeditions, though armed with a camera rather than a harpoon. Whales are attracted to the area by nutrient-rich seas in summer, and on a boat trip to the mouth of Massachusetts Bay we spotted minke and humpback whales, along with dolphins, seals and a lone basking shark\n\nIn more recent American history, the area was associated with the ill-fated Kennedy family, the closest the U.S. has to royalty.\n\nIn Cape Cod, the Kennedys still have a compound, consisting of three houses, from where power-hungry Joe Kennedy plotted the ascendancy of his sons John and Robert. The latter\u2019s widow Ethel, 91, still lives there.\n\nThe blood and blubber that once caked the streets (sailors used to say you could smell Nantucket before you saw it) have been replaced by boutiques and cocktail bars.\n\nThe locals joke that millionaires here make ends meet by mowing lawns for billionaires. And the island has an unofficial dress code: you can usually spot a pair of \u2018Nantucket Reds\u2019 \u2014 cherry-coloured trousers or shorts \u2014 wherever you go\n\nMy main mode of transport in Nantucket was a bike hired from Young\u2019s Bicycle Shop (for a daily charge of $33). I pedalled around the island\u2019s numerous trails, pausing to admire a lighthouse or secluded beach and admiring the grey-shingled cottages as well as the larger homes built on Boston bankers\u2019 bonuses.\n\nAmid the preppy shops lining the cobbled streets of the main town (which has the feel of a model village) were numerous places to seek sustenance including Black-Eyed Susan\u2019s, a popular diner serving blueberry pancakes and creamy eggs Benedict. Many of the local places like to boast that \u2018we serve farm-to-table produce\u2019.\n\nNew England is also known for its fine clam chowder. The dish originated in Massachusetts and historically clams were used as they were easy to harvest\n\nAfter I\u2019d sampled this wholesome fare, the mood changed when I quipped to a waitress that it was surprising moneybags Donald Trump didn\u2019t own a property on the island.\n\n\u2018Sir,\u2019 she replied with feeling, \u2018I believe that Mr Trump has tried to buy his way in here and there was even talk of him applying to build a golf club. All I can say, sir, is that it was made very plain to him that he is not welcome here, president or no president.\u2019\n\nNaturally, I avoided the subject of Mr Trump later in the day at my next pit stop, the Club Car restaurant, a refurbished railway carriage with a menu of delicious seafood dishes. But even here there was a no-go celebrity topic \u2014 because it used to be a haunt of the actor Kevin Spacey until he became involved (allegedly) with one of the bar staff.\n\nWe will spare ourselves the details, suffice to say that Mr Spacey has since opted for a lower profile and is now rarely seen on the island.\n\nThere are no Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s or Apple stores \u2014franchises are banned, even for Tommy Hilfiger, who has a summer home here. The arrival of a Ralph Lauren outpost on Main Street in 2006 so incensed locals that the town passed an ordinance: From then on, no chains could move in downtown.\n\nMy base in Nantucket was certainly not part of a chain.\n\nThe Wauwinet recently had a lavish refurbishment \u2014 a sweeping lawn lined with sun loungers (and shared, in the early morning mist, with plenty of rabbits) gives a perfect view of the bay.\n\nIn summer you can take a water taxi into town, although the journey takes an hour. But nobody here seems in much of a hurry.\n\nThe 32-room hotel, all wooden floors and soothing hues, has plenty of spaces to settle down for an exploration of the island\u2019s strong literary tradition, upheld in the town\u2019s beautiful library and bookshops.\n\nBesides Rhode Island, New England consists of Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Vermont, plus the enduringly fashionable islands of Martha\u2019s Vineyard and Nantucket (pictured)\n\nTennessee Williams spent summers on Nantucket, as did John Steinbeck, Truman Capote and Christopher Isherwood.\n\nBeach picnics are popular, invariably involving clam chowder and delicious local lobster.\n\nOr you can take a four-wheel drive tour of the Coskata-Coatue Wildlife Refuge at the northernmost point of the island.\n\nI joined four other holidaymakers on a trip organised by the local nature appreciation society (for $70) and we were transfixed by a family of seals frolicking in the water. But such is the level of protection of their natural habitat that we were only allowed on a small part of the dunes, as five miles of them were temporarily closed in order to protect a pair of nesting birds.\n\nI daresay some of the rich and famous here would like similar protection. But it\u2019s open for all \u2014 and for that we can be grateful.", "description": "Rhode Island is a favourite haunt of celebrities and Taylor Swift even owns a mansion\u00a0there.
