Blink and you could miss it.\n\nHandre Pollard v Yu Tamura\n\nPollard, blessed with a sublime kicking game, alternated flyhalf duties with Elton Jantjies during the pool stages but he will marshal South Africa for the showdown with Japan.\n\nHe is up against a slightly unknown quantity in the shape of Tamura, who has been a revelation for the host side.\n\nCool as a cucumber, Tamura leads the World Cup with 48 points so far and has landed 10 penalties - also a tournament high - despite not always understanding the instructions English-speaking team-mates are barking at him.\n\nTamura's kicking has been spot-on and he never shirks a tackle. His calmness under pressure alongside Leitch and veterans such as Shota Horie and Luke Thompson will be crucial when Japan face a fired-up South Africa side with serious World Cup ambitions and hell-bent on exorcising the demons of the \"Brighton Miracle\".\n\nKick-off is at 12:15 (SA time) on Sunday.\n\nTeams:\n\nJapan\n\n15 Ryohei Yamanaka, 14 Kotaro Matsushima, 13 Timothy Lafaele, 12 Ryoto Nakamura, 11 Kenki Fukuoka, 10 Yu Tamura, 9 Yutaka Nagare, 8 Kazuki Himeno, 7 Lappies Labuschagne, 6 Michael Leitch (captain), 5 James Moore, 4 Luke Thompson, 3 Koo Ji-won, 2 Shota Horie, 1 Keita Inagaki\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Atsushi Sakate, 17 Isileli Nakajima, 18 Asaeli Ai Valu, 19 Wimpie van der Walt, 20 Amanaki Lelei Mafi, 21 Fumiaki Tanaka, 22 Rikiya Matsuda, 23 Lomano Lava Lemeki\n\nSouth Africa\n\n15 Willie le Roux, 14 Cheslin Kolbe, 13 Lukhanyo Am, 12 Damian de Allende, 11 Makazole Mapimpi, 10 Handre Pollard, 9 Faf de Klerk, 8 Duane Vermeulen, 7 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 6 Siya Kolisi (captain), 5 Lood de Jager, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Frans Malherbe, 2 Bongi Mbonambi, 1 Tendai Mtawarira\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Vincent Koch, 19 RG Snyman, 20 Franco Mostert, 21 Francois Louw, 22 Herschel Jantjies, 23 Frans Steyn", "description": "Three head-to-heads for the Rugby World Cup quarter-final between hosts Japan and South Africa in Tokyo on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7819/9a5ec86e66d6497b974f92fa3a47df1b.png", "published_at": "2019-03-18"}
