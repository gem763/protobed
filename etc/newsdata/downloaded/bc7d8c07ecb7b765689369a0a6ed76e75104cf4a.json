(You can check out the full list of destinations below).\n\n(Image: iStockphoto)\n\nIt sounds utterly dreamy, although the price tag will quickly bring you back to reality.\n\nThat's because the epic South America: A Grand Voyage cruise will set you back \u00a317,324 for a balcony cabin.\n\nThe silver lining? It's an all-inclusive sailing, encompassing your accommodation, chauffeur service to the port, all-inclusive drinks and meals, daily afternoon tea, onboard gratuities, free wifi and optional travel insurance.\n\n(Image: Mikel/Flickr)\n\nIt's by no means a budget-friendly holiday, but it does work out at approximately \u00a3208pp per day, so if you do happen to have the money, you can get plenty of bang for your buck.\n\nThen of course you'll be on board Saga's brand new cruise ship Spirit of Discovery which took to the seas earlier this year. Think luxurious cabins, a cosy library, luxury spa and impressive theatre - cruise fans can take a sneak peek inside.\n\nThe ship boasts a gross tonnage of 58,250 gross and holds less than 1,000 passengers to make for a serene setting.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nFull list of destinations\n\nFunchal, Madeira\n\nMindelo, Cape Verde\n\n\n\nCruise the Amazon River\n\n\n\nParintins, Brazil\n\n\n\nManaus, Brazil\n\n\n\nSantarem, Brazil\n\n\n\nFortaleza, Brazil\n\n\n\nSalvador, Brazil\n\n\n\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\n\n\nBuenos Aires, Argentina\n\n\n\nMontevideo, Uruguay\n\n\n\nStanley, Falkland Islands\n\n\n\nCruise Cape Horn\n\n\n\nUshuaia, Argentina\n\n\n\nPunta Arenas, Chile\n\n\n\nPuerto Chacabuco, Chile\n\n\n\nPuerto Montt, Chile\n\n\n\nValparaiso, Chile\n\n\n\nCallao, Peru\n\n\n\nMachaia, Ecuador\n\n\n\nGuayaquil, Ecuador\n\n\n\nFlamenco Marina, Panama\n\n\n\nTransit the Panama Canal\n\n\n\nColon, Panama\n\n\n\nCartagena, Colombia\n\n\n\nSanta Marta, Colombia\n\n\n\nWillemstad, Curacao\n\n\n\nSt John's, Antigua\n\n\n\nPonta Deelgada, Azores\n\n\n\nLisbon, Portugal\n\nFeeling tempted?
