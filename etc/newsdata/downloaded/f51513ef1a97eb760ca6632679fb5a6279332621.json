According to the memo, the White House official \u201cdescribed the (July 25th) call as \u2018crazy,\u2019 \u2018frightening,\u2019 and \u2018completely lacking in substance related to national security.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe first whistleblower complaint helped spark House Democrats to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into the president, with many claiming he improperly pressured Ukraine to investigate potential 2020 election rival Joe Biden, whose son Hunter once sat on the board of a key Ukrainian energy firm. Trump repeatedly has denied he did anything wrong.\n\nThe whistleblower memo appeared to rebut criticism that the White House-released transcript was notes or a summary, writing that the \u201cstandard practice\u201d was for the \u201cWhite House situation room to produce a word-for-word transcript that memorializes the call.\u201d The whistleblower also stated the transcript was produced and being \u201ctreated very sensitively.\u201d\n\nSignificantly, the whistleblower noted, \u201cThe President did not raise security assistance\u201d during the call. Allegations of a quid pro quo were central to the complaint, later filed by the whistleblower in mid-August which also \u201cconnected the dots\u201d through media reports and other unnamed officials.\n\n\u201cThe President told Zelensky that he would be sending his personal lawyer, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, to Ukraine soon and requested that Zelensky meet with him. Zelensky reluctantly agreed that, if Giuliani travelled to Ukraine, he would see him,\u201d the whistleblower wrote.\n\nIG COULD NOT EXPLAIN 18-DAY WINDOW BETWEEN UKRAINE CALL AND WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT: SOURCES\n\nIn the transcript, Zelensky said, \u201cwe are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nFox News reached out to the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys, who did not immediately respond.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOn Friday, the lawyers did not respond to Fox News\u2019 questions about their client\u2019s failure to disclose his or her contacts with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s staff, as well as the whistleblower\u2019s prior work history with a current, prominent Democratic politician.\n\nOn Monday, the whistleblower\u2019s legal team confirmed a second whistleblower from the intelligence community had come forward with first-hand knowledge of certain allegations contained in the first whistleblower\u2019s complaint, which was said to have been based primarily on second-hand sources.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Immediately after learning second-hand information from a White House official about President Trump\u2019s July 25\u00a0phone call with the president of Ukraine, the first whistleblower wrote a dramatic personal memo, saying the White House official characterized the call as \u201ccrazy\u201d and\u00a0\u201cfrightening,\u201d Fox News has learned.", "authors": ["Catherine Herridge", "Catherine Herridge Is An Award-Winning Chief Intelligence Correspondent For Fox News Channel", "Fnc", "Based In Washington", "D.C.
