That\u2019s not what China says.", "language": "en", "text": "The dueling narratives from the White House and Beijing show just how far apart the two sides remain 18 months into a trade war that has brought the global economy to a perilous place and slowed the U.S. economy. Business leaders have halted investments because of the uncertainty.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs farmers await details of what exactly was agreed to, they are watching carefully to see what the final number will be because there is a vast difference between $50 billion a year, which would be a major expansion of sales to China, and $50 billion over two years, which would merely return the U.S.-China agricultural trade to roughly what it was before Trump launched his trade war.\n\nChina was routinely purchasing more than $20 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products a year before the trade war became heated last year, including a record $25.9 billion in purchases in 2012, according to U.S. Agriculture Department data. But sales to China tumbled to less than $10 billion last year and remain on track for a similar slump this year.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t ask for this. We\u2019ve been unfairly retaliated against. I think farmers just want to get back to business as usual,\u201d said John Newton, chief economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation. He noted China has made a lot of commitments to buy soybeans in 2020 but those contracts can be canceled at any time.\n\nTrump has long enjoyed high popularity in farm country, but his trade war has been especially harmful to American farmers, some of whom are starting to indicate they would not vote for him again if the trade war doesn\u2019t end soon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe White House has yet to release any details of the \u201cphase one\u201d deal on paper, but Trump is already heralding it as the best deal ever for American farmers. In the Oval Office on Friday, Trump told reporters China\u2019s new agricultural purchases would be \u201ctwo and a half, three times what China had purchased at its highest point thus far,\u201d a statement that is not backed up by the data.\n\n\u201cThe deal I just made with China is, by far, the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country. In fact, there is a question as to whether or not this much product can be produced? Our farmers will figure it out. Thank you China!\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday.\n\nAs Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He stood face to face in the Oval Office on Friday, a reporter asked whether the agreement was for $40 billion to $50 billion in purchases every year. Trump turned to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and asked him to \u201cdefine that, please.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt will scale up to an annual figure. Yes,\u201d said Mnuchin, who later added it would hit that higher level \u201cwithin the second year.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the U.S. trade representative said Thursday that China had committed to $40 billion to $50 billion a year, \u201cscaling up over two years,\u201d implying purchases would be significantly higher by 2021.\n\nWhether China picks up its agricultural purchases is likely to play a critical role in Trump\u2019s popularity in states such as Iowa that depend heavily on soybean sales to China. Exports of soybeans to China were typically above $12 billion a year before the trade war, but that cratered to barely over $3 billion last year.\n\nOctober is a key month for soybean harvests, and sales to China are typically heavy from October through January, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation, meaning the next few weeks will be telling about just how committed China is to increasing purchases.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany farmers are debating what else China might buy from the United States. Sales of lumber, ethanol and fish to China have been rising in recent years and could help China meet a commitment to purchase more if those areas continue to increase.\n\nChina also is struggling to supply enough pork products to its citizens after many of the nation\u2019s pigs were infected with an outbreak of African swine fever. But even in 2012, when China made record purchases of U.S. farm products, the Chinese bought only about $1 billion in pork and other meat products, raising questions about how high it could go.\n\n\u201cThere should be higher demand from China for U.S. pork,\u201d said Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cBut I doubt China will all of a sudden import $14 billion a year of pork. All the lost soybean sales won\u2019t be made up with more pork.\u201d\n\nRelated:\n\nAD", "description": "The heart of Trump's \"phase one\" trade deal with China is supposed to be $50 billion of U.S. farm product purchases a year, but the Chinese have yet to confirm that number, and details remain scarce.", "authors": ["Heather Long", "Economics Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/h5DI1bCG_F6PzBGSzKo2X6MlIGA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GMD6KIXO3EI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
