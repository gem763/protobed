It was terrifying \u2014 could it happen again?\n\nJ. Fairhead, Tonbridge, Kent.\n\nBell\u2019s palsy is when the nerve that controls facial movement becomes suddenly paralysed. It affects one side of the face, causing the eyebrow to sag and the mouth to droop.\n\nNamed after Sir Charles Bell, who identified this nerve in the early 1800s, the effect is dramatic and disfiguring and, as you found, it can be a terrifying experience. Much of the anxiety is driven by the fact that not all people recover fully, which can be devastating.\n\nWhile Bell\u2019s palsy is responsible for more than half of all cases of facial paralysis, other causes include shingles, where the same virus that causes chicken pox affects the nerves, and otitis media, a middle-ear infection which can press on the facial nerve as it passes through the middle ear to the brain, as well as Lyme disease, tumour and stroke.\n\nPeople with diabetes are advised to have the annual flu jab because you are more at risk, and flu might affect you more severely, as well as affecting blood sugar levels\n\nBetween 15 and 30 in every 100,000 people develop Bell\u2019s palsy each year and, while the exact mechanism is unknown, it tends to happen when people are \u2018run down\u2019 or under stress. Indeed, research has found that the herpes simplex virus \u2014 which causes cold sores and which reactivates when the immune system is overloaded \u2014 often affects the facial nerve.\n\nPeople with diabetes are advised to have the annual flu jab because you are more at risk, and flu might affect you more severely, as well as affecting blood sugar levels.\n\nAs for whether the vaccine is linked to Bell\u2019s, there was a report in 2004 describing a series of 46 cases of Bell\u2019s palsy following the use of a certain flu vaccine delivered nasally and used only in Switzerland. But there are no reports of any association between Bell\u2019s palsy and the flu jabs used here in the UK, and it is most likely that the onset in your case was coincidental.\n\nGiven the lack of evidence of any link, and the well proven benefits of the flu vaccine, particularly in people of your age and with a known diagnosis of diabetes, I urge you to have one when the jabs become available this month.\n\nI have had erectile problems over the past six months, but numerous blood tests have come back OK. I have also noticed that my penis has a bend in it on erection. I am 57.\n\nBilly, via email.\n\nIt sounds like you have Peyronie\u2019s disease, a disorder of the tough membrane that surrounds the spongy tissue of the penis. It occurs when fibrous plaques \u2014 like spontaneous scar tissue \u2014 form within the membrane.\n\nThis scar tissue is rigid and inelastic, affecting erectile function and causing the distortion you have experienced. It\u2019s not known why it happens, but there is suspicion that micro-injury sets up uncontrolled inflammation, which escalates into this spontaneous scarring.\n\nA survey of 8,000 suggested 3 per cent of men have Peyronie\u2019s disease and 20 to 50 per cent of those also have erectile dysfunction\n\nPain can occur in the early stages, but ceases after a year or two when the acute inflammatory phase ends. After this, the deformity gets no worse, but usually no better, either \u2014 the condition resolves itself in only 12 per cent of men.\n\nA survey of 8,000 suggested 3 per cent of men have this condition and 20 to 50 per cent of those also have erectile dysfunction.\n\nI would ask your GP to refer you to a urologist. The first line of treatment is the drug pentoxifylline, with a dose of 400mg taken three times daily. This acts on a growth factor involved in scar tissue forming \u2014 studies show that pentoxifylline slows the rate at which the curvature progresses, but early treatment (and it sounds like you are just in time) gives better outcomes.\n\nVitamin E, a powerful antioxidant, may also be prescribed. It\u2019s thought to reduce collagen deposits, the material that creates the plaques.\n\nThe specialist may also suggest injecting collagenase, an enzyme that, in theory, softens collagen and so reduces plaque formation. One study has shown this produced an average 34 per cent improvement in the curvature.\n\nIf the deformity persists, there are surgical options to correct it \u2014 a surgeon will recommend the best.\n\nLong term outcomes are good, with return to sexual activity for more than 80 per cent of people who have surgery.\n\nIn my view... A good GP can inspire better habits\n\nOne of the greatest difficulties doctors face nowadays is how to persuade patients to change their lifestyles.\n\nWhether it\u2019s dietary advice or the dangers of smoking, many people seem hell-bent on ignoring what we tell them.\n\nWhen someone does want to change, however, it can save their life. Stelios, a friend of mine who lives in Athens, recently told me how he had stopped his 60-a-day smoking habit.\n\nHe was having a coffee with one of my friends from work, a cardiologist, when my colleague commented on the fact that Stelios had smoked three cigarettes over the course of one espresso. He said this was dangerous, asked Stelios his age \u2014 42 \u2014 and told him he\u2019d be lucky to reach 50.\n\nOne of the greatest difficulties doctors face nowadays is how to persuade patients to change their lifestyles, writes DR MARTIN SCURR\n\nStelios had just had his first child, a baby girl, and the combination of being proud parent and having his early demise predicted by a complete stranger \u2014 albeit a respected cardiologist \u2014 triggered \u2018a magic moment\u2019, and Stelios stopped smoking that day.\n\nBut he started snacking instead, and when he gained 21 kg (more than 3 st) over the next year, colleagues encouraged him to start jogging.\n\nHe began with just five minutes, and then ten.\n\nWithin a year, he had lost all that weight and now he runs a marathon every month in less than three hours \u2014 highly respectable for a man in his mid-40s.\n\nYes, change is possible, but patients can\u2019t wait for serendipitous encounters, like Stelios\u2019s, for that to happen.\n\nThey need their doctors taking the time to get to know them; it\u2019s the sort of relationship that comes from long-term continuity of care \u2014 not health apps and online GP services \u2014 that unearths such \u2018magic moments\u2019.", "description": "ASK THE GP: I am 68 years old and diabetic, but I have avoided the flu jab since 2014, when, exactly two weeks after having the vaccination, I developed Bell's palsy.
