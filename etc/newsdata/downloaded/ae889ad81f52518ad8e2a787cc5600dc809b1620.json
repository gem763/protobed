In 2016 PHD candidate Kevin Martin from the University of Iceland returned to the wreck site to carry out a detailed high-resolution 3D survey with his team, including archaeologists from the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands\n\nMelckmeyt was a Dutch merchant ship that found its way into a vicious storm while heading home to Amsterdam (pictured is a recreation of the ship)\n\n'We have also been able to directly embed a 3D survey of the seabed with full photographic texture. In theory, a member of the public viewing this might even spot something on the wreck that we have missed during our dives on it!'\n\nPHD candidate in Maritime Archaeology at Flinders University, John McCarthycreated the virtual dive.\n\n'Funding from the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Canberra allowed me to travel from Australia to the Netherlands to make a 3D scan of a rare ship model from the 17th century, supporting the most authentic reconstruction of the ship possible. We have even based the stern painting on a real contemporary Dutch painting, Vermeer's' famous 'Milkmaid', painted just one year before the ship was wrecked.'", "description": "Australian archaeologists have developed a 360-degree view of the Dutch Melckmeyt or 'Milkmaid', which disappeared into the depths during a storm 360 years ago and was rediscovered in 1992.", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/20/19804244-0-image-a-65_1571255441780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
