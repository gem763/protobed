weather before such batters the Earth is being developed by aerospace firm Airbus\n\nThe UK arm of Airbus, which is headquartered in the Netherlands, is one of four firms developing space weather monitoring concepts for the European Space Agency.\n\nHigh-energy solar storms have the potential to cause billions of pounds of economic damage if, for example, they took out our satellite-based navigation systems.\n\nThe most powerful discharges come in eruptions called 'coronal mass ejections' (CMEs), which expel billions of tons of charged particles bound in magnetic fields that can be larger than the Earth itself.\n\nThe European Space Science Committee \u2014 which is part of the European Science Foundation \u2014 presented a series of recommendations to the European Space Agency for improved resiliency against space weather events on October 10, 2019.\n\nThe document calls for more research in the field, Europe-wide coordination in space monitoring efforts, improved storm forecast models and an improvement in space weather observation systems.\n\nThe intended construction European Space Agency's Lagrange satellite will help address that final need.\n\n'Space weather is one of these areas where scientific knowledge, societal aspects and economic interest are intrinsically linked,' said report author Hermann Opgenoorth of the Swedish Institute of Space Physics in Uppsala.\n\n'Our study committee identified actionable recommendations that would strengthen Europe\u2019s knowledge and preparedness,' he added.\n\n'Space Weather is strongly associated with modern societies,' added European Space Science Committee chair Athena Coustenis.\n\n'European citizens\u2019 daily life depends to a great extent on assets and services that can be impacted by disruptions caused by solar activity.'\n\n'I am glad that the European Space Sciences Committee decided to address this important issue and to facilitate the definition of robust recommendations.'\n\nThe Lagrange satellite will follow the Earth along its orbit, maintaining a view on the side of the side of the Sun that is about to rotate into the view of the Earth\n\nThe UK arm of Airbus, which is headquartered in the Netherlands, is one of four firms developing space weather monitoring concepts for the European Space Agency\n\nThe proposed satellite's name is a reference to how it will operate from one of the so-called 'Lagrange Points', which are sweetspots around the Earth and Sun where various forces \u2014 including gravity and orbital motion \u2014 are balanced out.\n\nAt these still points, objects retain their relative position with respect to both the Earth and the Sun, rather than falling into orbit around one of the other.\n\nThe Lagrange satellite will sit at 'Lagrangian Point 5' (L5), essentially following the Earth in its orbit while maintaining an advanced view of the side of the Sun which is about to rotate into the view of the Earth.\n\nThis will allow it to have a 'sneak peak' at impending solar storms well before they have any impact on the Earth.\n\n'Just because the spacecraft is not aligned with Earth and the Sun does not mean it will not be affected by the space weather events it will be monitoring,' said European Space Agency space environment specialist Piers Jiggens.\n\n'This is because the solar magnetic field, which high energy particles follow, is curved because of the Sun\u2019s rotation, a phenomenon known as the \"Parker spiral\".'\n\n'What this means is that the fastest charged particles from a CME event will reach Lagrange in a matter of minutes after an eruption.'\n\nIt is hoped that the Lagrange satellite will be aided in its mission by a US-administered counterpart, which would be parked at Lagrangian Point 1, directly between the Sun and the Earth.\n\nThe Lagrange satellite will sit at 'Lagrangian Point 5' (L5), pictured, essentially following the Earth in its orbit while maintaining an advanced view of the side of the Sun which is about to rotate into the view of the Earth\n\nThe UK Government, which supports the Lagrange feasibility studies by means of its membership of the European Space Agency, put forward a further \u00a320 million (around $25 million) towards space weather research last month.\n\nThe lion's share of this funding will be directed to the UK Met Office \u2014 Britain's centre of excellence for space weather studies \u2014 whose experts work closely with US-based counterparts to issue forecasts and warnings to relevant parties.\n\nAmong these recipients are satellite operators, who use the alerts to determine when to turn their spacecraft as to shield sensitive electronics from the worst impacts of solar storms.\n\nDelegates from the European Space Agency's member state will meet in late November, where they will discuss funding the next phase of this project.\n\nThe European Space Science Committee's full series of recommendations were published in the Journal of Space Weather and Space Climate.\n\nThe European Space Science Committee \u2014 which is part of the European Science Foundation \u2014 presented a series of recommendations to the European Space Agency for
