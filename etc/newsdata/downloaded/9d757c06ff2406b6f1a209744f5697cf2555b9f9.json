Cash for next year's vacation needs to be treated differently than cash for a retirement 20 years down the road.\n\n[See: 8 Investing Do's and Don'ts During Market Volatility.]\n\nThe idea of risk versus reward is central to smart investing. You don't want to risk, and lose, your money right before you need it. However, keeping money in safe investments, like bonds, could result in few gains and mean you won't have enough for your long- term goal.\n\nHere's a look at savvy short- and long- term investing strategies that will help you balance risk and reward depending on when you'll need your cash .\n\nSaving for the Short Term\n\nWhen it comes to money for short-term goals, finance experts say people should focus on saving rather than investing. Money needed in fewer than three years needs to be protected from market volatility.\n\n\"Short-term [investing] is where people make mistakes,\" says Oliver Lee, owner of The Strategic Planning Group in Lake Orion, Michigan. \"They see the bright light that says 6 percent and jump in.\" However, those types of returns usually require people to take risks they shouldn't with money that will be needed shortly.\n\nFor short-term goals, try one of the following short- term investments:\n\n-- High yield savings accounts.\n\n-- CD ladders and money market accounts.\n\n-- Short-term bond funds.\n\n-- Fixed income funds.\n\n-- Structured notes.\n\nHigh Yield Savings Accounts\n\nPeople should forget about investing money needed in less than a year. Instead, find a high yield savings account to keep money safe and instantly available. Online banks such as Marcus by Goldman Sachs and Barclays are offering APYs as high as 2% on their high yield savings accounts. While that isn't as much as what can be earned in investments, money in a savings account is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000 and is therefore safe from any loss.\n\nCD Ladders and Money Market Accounts\n\nYou may be able to earn slightly more by placing money in a certificate of deposit ( CD) rather than a savings account. However, the best rates are only available if you agree to tie up your money for at least a year or more. To keep cash liquid, some people set up CD ladders with varying maturity dates. This approach ensures at least part of the savings will be available at any given time.\n\nMoney market accounts are another short- term investment option. \"While the Fed is currently lowering rates there are many money market funds that provide a reasonable yield for short- term cash,\" Lockyer says. They can offer comparable interest to some CDs and come with fewer restrictions. However, you may be allowed only a limited number of withdrawals from the account each month.\n\nShort-Term Bond Funds\n\nOnce a person's time horizon moves past 18 months, it begins to make sense to place money in relatively stable short- term investments. Short-term bond funds are one way to increase returns with relatively little risk.\n\nStill, the gains on these funds are minimal compared to other investments. Ten-year annualized returns for many bond funds hover around 2% to 4%.\n\nFixed Income Funds\n\nSimilarly, fixed income funds offer a relatively stable way to get a return greater than that offered through savings or money market accounts. Many of these funds include bonds, but they may also include other securities. Fixed income funds don't offer much in the way of gains, but they are designed to minimize risk and limit losses in a down market so they can make good short- term investments.\n\nMichael Windle, a retirement income certified professional and owner of C. Curtis Financial in Plymouth, Michigan, says people sometimes make a mistake by thinking they need to save up thousands of dollars before they can invest in fixed income or other market funds. \"Instead of parking money in a savings account, just put it in [investments],\" he says. Doing so can help improve overall returns.\n\nStory continues", "description": "You will find plenty of advice about which stocks are hot and how to invest money in the stock market.  \"We really think if you take a goals-based investment approach, that is best,\" says D.
