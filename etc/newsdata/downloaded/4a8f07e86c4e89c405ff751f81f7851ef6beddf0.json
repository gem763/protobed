The analysis forecasts Balaclava\u2019s current median house price of $1.07 million to increase by nearly $325,000.\n\nMORE: Inside top-secret WWI bunker conversion home\n\nEpic tiny home on wheels worth $2 million\n\nSydney couples trick to get six homes\n\nJeremy Sheppard is director of research for Select Residential Property Research Group, the company behind SuburbGrowth.com.au, and explains that the research identifies areas with sound market fundamentals where the principals of supply and demand are putting upward pressure on prices.\n\nThe top 10 predicted price performers are in Victoria, NSW, Queensland, South Australia and the ACT with current median house prices ranging from $396,000 to nearly $1.3 million.\n\n\u201cThe research highlights that each major region has suburbs with price potential, regardless of what the market cycle is doing at the time,\u201d he adds.\n\nJosh Stirling of McGrath St Kilda has sold several Balaclava residences in recent years and says the huge price growth prediction sounds a bit too good to be true, but he does have high hopes for the suburb.\n\n\u201cIf anywhere in Melbourne is going to do it, it\u2019d be Balaclava. It probably isn\u2019t going to jump by 30 per cent in the next three years \u2014 that\u2019s pretty ambitious.\n\nIt definitely does feel like things are on the rise, but it\u2019s been a pretty stable return.\n\nHonestly, I can\u2019t see any market booming to that degree, but I hope it does \u2014 it\u2019s a great suburb.\n\nIn Mr Stirling\u2019s opinion, Balaclava is undervalued considering its surrounded by popular \u201cblue chip\u201d suburbs like St Kilda, Elwood and Elsternwick.\n\n\u201cWhen a buyer is priced out of their ideal suburb, they don\u2019t want to venture too far away. So, we\u2019ve certainly seen a lot of that around here. The price gap between Balaclava and the other waterside suburbs is getting smaller,\u201d he says.\n\nMORE: Is this 2.5m wide house Australia\u2019s skinniest home?\n\nAussie islands for sale for the price of a house\n\nThe number two spot on the list, but the top performer for potential capital growth by dollar value, is Narraweena in Sydney\u2019s Northern Beaches region.\n\n\u201cThe research forecasts a $386,000 change in its median house price, so it would be wise to not delay if you\u2019re interested in buying there anytime soon,\u201d he says.\n\nMario Esposito, selling agent with McGrath Dee Why, has sold multiple homes in Narraweena and calls the suburb home himself.\n\n\u201cThe thing with Narraweena is that it\u2019s been underwhelmed for long time, and we\u2019re coming from a lower base, to be fair. It\u2019s a sought after location, that did take a hit over the last 12 months as have a lot of Sydney suburbs,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cHomes in the area that would have sold for around $1.4 million in the peak around 2017 have more recently been getting closer to $1.2 million. But now we\u2019re starting to claw back.\n\nSo 29.7 per cent is great, but I do believe certain pockets will perform better than others,\u201d he explains.\n\nHelensburgh, located about halfway between Sydney and Wollongong, came in third. The study forecast the suburb will achieve 28.6 per cent median house price growth over the three-year period.\n\n\u201cHelensburgh\u2019s location as well as affordability compared to Sydney are just some of the reasons why this suburb is poised for growth,\u201d Mr Sheppard says.\n\nThe research then placed Fullerton in Adelaide at number four with a predicted growth of 28 per cent, or $255,000.\n\nMr Sheppard says city-fringe suburb is one of Adelaide\u2019s most desirable locations with demand from owner occupiers likely to remain strong.\n\nWhen it came to fifth place, Mr Sheppard picked St Albans Park in Geelong, a region that continues to benefit from its commutable distance from Melbourne and affordability.\n\n\u201cThe research found that the median house price in St Albans Park is forecast to grow by 27.5 per cent or nearly $110,000,\u201d Mr Sheppard says.", "description": "Investors and homebuyers hunting for the best capital growth suburbs in the country now have a new list at hand \u2014 Top 10 suburbs with the best potential price growth.", "authors": ["Kirsten Craze"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/15000422/capi_35927423b85453b8a2c274402f8b6d4b_97508fc9bd80c1d1002badca0f141f9c.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
