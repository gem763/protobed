I think that's the biggest work-on for us,\" he said.\n\nHe said he believed he had the players in the squad to go all the way, but only if they focused for the whole match.\n\n\"I guess we don't have to improve in specific departments... it's more to concentrate for the full 80 minutes. That's where we need to improve if we want to win the World Cup,\" said the coach.\n\nErasmus paid tribute to the Japanese team and their fans, who he said should be \"proud of the way you are hosting this World Cup\".\n\n\"Overall, I think Japanese rugby is in a really good space,\" he said.", "description": "South Africa coach Rassie Erasmus admitted his team was \"very nervous\" leading only 5-3 at half-time against Japan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2868/c08113fcc74c4e518ccbdc6935832c22.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
