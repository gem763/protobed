Prior to the deal announcement, Pivotal was down nearly 50% on the year, after having plunged in early June due to weak results and guidance.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) follow up on last year's CA Technologies deal by announcing that it's buying Symantec's enterprise security operations for $10.7 billion. In addition, since this deal was announced, private equity firms Permira and Advent International have reportedly made a $16.4 billion bid for the whole of Symantec, whose shares have been range-bound for much of this decade amid share losses and execution issues.\n\nCarl Icahn disclose an 18%-plus stake in big data/analytics software firm Cloudera (CLDR) , whose shares were down over 70% from their 2018 highs prior to news of Icahn's stake. Icahn and Cloudera reached a standstill agreement in August.\n\nActivist investor Starboard Value disclose a 7.5% stake in cloud storage/collaboration software provider Box (BOX) . Box's shares were 40% below their 52-week high, and more than 50% below their May 2018 high, before Starboard made its disclosure.\n\nThis uptick in corporate and institutional interest in relatively beaten-down software names doesn't necessarily mean that more richly-valued firms will cease to draw interest. Indeed, VMware's Pivotal deal announcement was accompanied by news of a $2.1 billion deal to buy endpoint security software firm Carbon Black (CBLK) . Whereas Pivotal is being acquired for just 3.5 times its expected fiscal 2020 (ends in Jan. 2020) sales, Carbon Black is being acquired for 8.6 times its expected 2019 sales.\n\nOver the last couple of years, there have also been a number of other large software deals featuring elevated multiples. Notable ones include IBM's $34 billion deal to buy Red Hat, SAP's $8 billion purchase of Qualtrics, Salesforce.com's $15.7 billion purchase of Tableau Software and $6.5 billion purchase of MuleSoft and Ultimate Software's $11 billion sale to an investor group led by PE firm Hellman & Friedman.\n\nIn a way, the fact that corporate/institutional interest in cheaper software firms -- generally companies that have had one or more earnings disappointments this year -- has grown acts as a fresh endorsement for the health of the broader enterprise software industry. The industry is still growing at a high-single digit clip (much better than total IT spending) as businesses conclude that it's in their interests to make larger software investments in a wide variety of fields. And while it wouldn't be right to call the industry completely recession-proof, its shift towards subscriptions from traditional, up-front, license sales could help it fare better during downturns than it has in the past.\n\nWith that in mind, here's a list of software firms carrying moderate valuations that could conceivably draw interest from a peer, an activist and/or private equity. As always, readers are advised to do their own research.\n\nPluralsight (PS) . Shares are down 46% over the last 12 months, and currently trading for 5.2 times expected 2020 billings.

New Relic is a major provider of application performance monitoring (APM) software.\n\nDropbox (DBX) .
