Introducing new donkeys to a herd is not always going to be plain-sailing. Donkeys are territorial, it can be like having new kids in class.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m often saying, \u2018Right you need five minutes out\u2019 or \u2018You two need to be separated for a bit\u2019 \u2013 but it\u2019s all just a natural part of being a donkey.\u201d\n\nMaxine says there are some groups the animals naturally fall into \u2013 such as \u201cthe oldies\u201d and \u201cthe young boys\u201d.\n\nBut she added: \u201cDonkeys are highly intelligent. Each has its own character.\n\n\u201cWhen a new donkey joins the herd we monitor them closely for a couple of weeks to see how they interact. They\u2019re incredible animals.\u201d\n\nRather than beach donkey rides, she urges parents to bring their children to meet the animals at the sanctuary.\n\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s free \u2013 we\u2019re open 365 days a year. They\u2019re not just long ears and soft, furry noses. Communities across the globe rely on them.\u201d\n\nYou can also take a couple home \u2013 if you have the space. Maxine said: \u201cDonkeys are fantastic companions.\n\nIn return they need your time, love and attention. We re-home our donkeys in pairs and ask they have approximately one acre of safe land, an area of hardstanding and access to shelter.\u201d", "description": "Maxine Carter and husband run Britain's biggest donkey sanctuary where they read each animal's individual character to monitor behaviour and keep conflict at bay", "authors": ["Karen Rockett", "Image", "Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20465827.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Donkey.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
