She was 75.\n\nOver her decadeslong career at ABC News and NPR, Ms. Roberts became one of the most prominent political broadcasters of her era, a familiar figure to millions of Americans and an ardent champion of younger generations of women in the media.\n\n\u201cCokie\u2019s kindness, generosity, sharp intellect and thoughtful take on the big issues of the day made ABC a better place and all of us better journalists,\u201d ABC News President James Goldston said.\n\nABC interrupted its regular programming to announce Ms. Roberts\u2019 death, drawing an outpouring of condolences from many of the politicians that she had covered, including former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cCokie Roberts was a trailblazer who forever transformed the role of women in the newsroom and in our history books,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) wrote on Twitter. \u201cOver five decades of celebrated journalism, Cokie shone a powerful light on the unsung women who built our nation, but whose stories had long gone untold.\u201d\n\nRepublican Sen. John Kennedy, a fellow Louisianan, lauded Ms. Roberts as \u201ca pioneer for women in journalism.\u2026My thoughts and prayers are with her family during this time.\u201d\n\nMs. Roberts was the daughter of Hale Boggs, a former Democratic House majority leader from Louisiana, and Lindy Boggs, who succeeded her husband in Congress.\n\nMs. Roberts worked in local news and CBS News before joining NPR to cover Congress in 1978.\n\nShe joined ABC a decade later, while retaining a part-time role as a political commentator at NPR.\n\nShe co-anchored ABC\u2019s Sunday political show \u201cThis Week\u201d with Sam Donaldson from 1996 to 2002.\n\nMr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, said Ms. Roberts was a role model for women at a time the journalism profession was still dominated by men, and was a constant over 40 years of a shifting media landscape and changing world.\n\n\u201cShe will be missed, and we send our condolences to her family,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\n\nMr. Bush and his wife, Laura, called Ms. Roberts a talented, tough and fair reporter.\n\n\u201cWe respected her drive and appreciated her humor,\u201d the former president said. \u201cShe became a friend.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One while en route to California, said he respected Ms. Roberts\u2019 professionalism, if not necessarily agreeing with her work.\n\n\u201cI never met her. She never treated me nicely,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut I would like to wish her family well. She was a professional, and I respect professionals.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Ms. Roberts requested that NPR to clarify her role as a commentator when she wrote a column calling on \u201cthe rational wing\u201d of the Republican party to reject Mr. Trump as their presidential candidate. But her colleagues said she never became cynical or lost her love for politics.\n\nMs. Roberts, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002, kept working nearly to the end. She appeared on \u201cThis Week\u201d in August, drawing enough concern about her evident weight loss that she released a statement saying \u201cI am doing fine\u201d and was looking forward to covering next year\u2019s election.\n\nShe co-wrote a political column for many years with her husband of 53 years, Steven Roberts.\n\nMs. Roberts also wrote several best-selling books focusing on the role of women in history. She wrote two books with her husband, one about interfaith families and \u201cFrom This Day Forward,\u201d an account of their marriage.\n\nMs. Roberts won three Emmys throughout her career and was named a \u201cLiving Legend\u201d by the Library of Congress in 2008.\n\nNPR described Ms. Roberts one of a small group of influential female journalists in the 1970s who revolutionized the broadcaster\u2019s male-dominated culture, with many younger staffers referring to her as one of \u201cthe Founding Mothers\u201d of NPR.\n\nABC News political reporter Jonathan Karl recalled being in awe of Ms. Roberts when he first started working at the network.\n\n\u201cWhen I think of politics, I think of Cokie Roberts,\u201d he said.\n\nMs. Roberts was born in New Orleans in 1943. As the daughter of two former U.S. representatives, Ms. Roberts\u2019s childhood was divided between in Louisiana and Washington, according to NPR. Her father served for three decades in Congress before dying in plane crash during a campaign trip to Alaska in 1972. Ms. Roberts\u2019 mother, Lindy Boggs, took her husband\u2019s congressional seat and served for 17 years, later becoming U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, according to NPR.\n\nShe attended Wellesley College and met her future husband at a conference for student leaders.\n\nMs. Roberts told Kentucky Educational Television in a 2017 interview that she had no regrets over pursuing a career in journalism instead of following her parents\u2019 footsteps into a life of public service Congress.\n\n\u201cI do feel strongly that informing the voters about what\u2019s going on, trying to explain it in ways that people can understand, and putting the issues out there is a form of participation,\u201d Ms. Roberts said in the interview, according to NPR.\n\nMs. Roberts is survived by her husband and two children, Lee and Rebecca.", "description": "Cokie Roberts, the daughter of politicians and a pioneering journalist who chronicled Washington from Jimmy Carter to Donald Trump for NPR and ABC News, died Tuesday of complications from breast cancer.
