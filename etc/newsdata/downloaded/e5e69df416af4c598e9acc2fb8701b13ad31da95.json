But Bakish said he is not worried about the competition because ViacomCBS is a major supplier of content to the streaming companies like Netflix.\n\n\"We will, on closing, be the leading market leader in television audience share in the United States. That makes us a partner video distributors absolutely need to have as part of their offering,\" said Bakish.\n\n\"Still the majority of the consumers in the United States are big bundle consumers,\" he added.\n\nLast month, Viacom and CBS announced the companies would merge into ViacomCBS. Bakish will be the CEO of the combined company.\n\nBakish said he expects the deal to close in December.", "description": "Viacom chief executive officer Bob Bakish says he's not worried about competition in the streaming space, on the heels of its merger with CBS.", "authors": ["Maggie Fitzgerald"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105446172-1536757035077gettyimages-465019264.jpeg?v=1568722981", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
