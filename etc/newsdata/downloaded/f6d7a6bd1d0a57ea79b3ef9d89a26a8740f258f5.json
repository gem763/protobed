It is built on a series of distortions, confused timelines, and outright inaccuracies,\u201d Oppenheim said.\n\nFarrow\u2019s Catch & Kill, which is set for release on Tuesday, has already inspired a heated back-and-forth between the former NBC reporter and the storied news division. Farrow recounts his time working on the Weinstein probe for NBC News and how he grew disillusioned with the network\u2019s hesitation to publish the piece, which he eventually took to the New Yorker and garnered a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nNBC News Chief Noah Oppenheim\u2019s Harvard Writings on Women and Sexual Assault Horrify Staffers\n\nOppenheim\u2019s memo on Monday offered point-by-point rebuttals to many of the NBC-related claims in the book. For one, the embattled NBC News chief denied Farrow\u2019s claim that Weinstein threatened to expose Lauer through the National Enquirer as a means to shutting down Farrow\u2019s investigation into the studio executive.\n\nThe news network, which has maintained it was completely unaware of Lauer\u2019s behavior, also said that severance paid to several women mentioned in Farrow\u2019s book was unrelated to their apparent knowledge of Lauer\u2019s misconduct. In an appearance Monday on CBS This Morning, however, Farrow replied that the amounts paid to the women who claimed they were aware of Lauer's misbehavior was \u201catypical.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel absolutely terrible that these three employees were subjected to Matt Lauer\u2019s horrific behavior, but the facts do not support Farrow\u2019s allegation of a \u2018cover-up,\u2019 and he offers no further evidence,\u201d Oppenheim wrote, adding that the company\u2019s legal team said there was \u201cno way we have found that NBC's current leadership could have been aware of his misdeeds in the past.\u201d\n\nThe company also heavily disputed Farrow\u2019s own recollection of his time attempting to report on Weinstein. In one example, NBC denied Farrow\u2019s claim that several colleagues did not listen to audio he had of a Weinstein accuser before killing his reporting.\n\nThe network also went after Farrow\u2019s old NBC News producer, Rich McHugh, who claimed he was ordered to \u201cstand down\u201d on the Weinstein reporting (the network said the \u201cstand down\u201d order came after Farrow had left the network).\n\nIn his appearance on CBS This Morning, Farrow dismissed Oppenheim's assertion to that end, noting that in addition to living the experience, he spent two years working on the book, which was fact-checked by a New Yorker researcher.\n\nFarrow also said that NBC\u2019s Monday memo included several \u201clies\u201d and \u201cuntruths.\u201d Network higher-ups are \"concealing the fact that they actively ordered us to stop,\u201d the reporter claimed.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll let the reporting in the book stand on its own, we\u2019re very confident in it,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile the network has experienced plenty of external criticism in the wake of Farrow\u2019s book, his reporting has also ignited fierce discussion among NBC News staffers, beginning when many were outraged when Farrow\u2019s Weinstein expos\u00e9 published in the New Yorker in 2017, and demanded to know how the network let an award-winning investigation walk out the door.\n\n\u2018Women Are Furious\u2019: NBC Roiled by Farrow Book Accusations\n\nPrivately, many NBC News and MSNBC staffers have said that allegations in Farrow\u2019s book have been damning, and expressed concern that the claims have threatened the credibility of the news network and its leadership.\n\nEmployees also began circulating Oppenheim\u2019s own decades-old Harvard Crimson columns, in which he wrote that \u201capparently women enjoy being confined, pumped full of alcohol and preyed upon,\u201d and lambasted NBC for firing sportscaster Marv Albert after he pleaded guilty to assault in a sex case. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more sorry I wrote them,\u201d Oppenheim commented Monday on those columns. \u201cThey are totally inappropriate.\u201d", "description": "Steven FerdmanNBC News on Monday is pushed back hard against damning claims made about the network in Ronan Farrow\u2019s new book, Catch & Kill, dubbing some of the allegations a \u201csmear,\u201d \u201clie,\u201d and \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201dIn a lengthy memo sent to staff, NBC News President Noah Oppenheim attempted to fact-check", "authors": ["Maxwell Tani"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/k9ucCXbXgrSCNnd0JHaL2g--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/80dd6c06f125368440b2c3e1ac111b62", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
