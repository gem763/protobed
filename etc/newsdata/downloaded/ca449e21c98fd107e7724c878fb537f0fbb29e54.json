We saw the most bluntly obvious version of this when Harvard rescinded its admission offer to Kyle Kashuv after former classmates posted screenshots of racist comments in a Google Doc file on Twitter. It\u2019s best to assume everything you do and say online can be exposed, even if it\u2019s not on a public social network.\n\nJust having an account on a social network generates all sorts of data about you. There\u2019s not much you can do about that. A browser extension, like Privacy Badger, can at least cut off data-hungry social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThere\u2019s another option for developing an online presence that doesn\u2019t leak any data you don\u2019t want it to, if you\u2019re willing to put in the effort: a personal website. Last year, a Vice reporter, Jason Koebler, made a compelling case for bringing personal websites back into style. Before Facebook, setting up your own page on sites like Xanga or LiveJournal was common, and the data controls were simple. This technology is still available to us, easier to use then ever, and gives you control over the privacy levers. Just don\u2019t share a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with your phone number on it.\n\nPersonal websites are already a must-have in a variety of industries, and paying to set up your own guarantees the data is generally in your control. Buying your own domain and setting up a site also gets you a dedicated email address, like yourname@yourname.com, and pulls you away from Google\u2019s obtrusive Gmail.\n\nBonus: When your web address is your name, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019ll bubble up to the top of Google search results with little effort from you.\n\nRetaining the type of social footprint required for work while still managing personal privacy isn\u2019t easy, nor is it foolproof. Terms of service and privacy policies change on a whim, and sites like Facebook tend to move the various privacy toggles around so often that it\u2019s hard to keep track of what you\u2019ve changed. If you must be online, a requirement for so many jobs these days, at least take control over what\u2019s shared and treat a majority of social networks for what they are: a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nFrom the Archives: \u2018Polygraph Tests for Jobs: Truth and Consequences\u2019", "description": "Every social network might as well be LinkedIn.", "authors": ["Thorin Klosowski"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/03/opinion/03privacy-newsletter/oakImage-1567528476655-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
