However, momentum is expected to pick up as more people are granted access.\n\nMerchant Group bought the shares in AusCann from its major shareholder and the largest publicly listed company in the space, Canopy Group Corporation.\n\nIt is the latest major medical cannabis investment for Mr Chapman, who previously bought up a significant position in now defunct stock 1-Page. He then orchestrated a board takeover, shut down the business and brought about a reverse takeover in which the 1-Page shell became the owner of German medical cannabis company HAPA Pharm.\n\nThe group had also invested previously in Cannpal Animal Therapeutics and Zelda Therapeutics.\n\nMr Chapman told The Australian Financial Review he wanted to use his experience with HAPA to be a \"supportive shareholder\" of AusCann.\n\n\"We have extensive experience and contacts in the space both domestically and internationally and feel that we can assist in fast-tracking commercial outcomes in the near term,\" he said.\n\n\"We will look to maintain a close working relationship with Canopy Growth Corporation, as AusCann reshapes itself to regain its leadership position in the Australian medical cannabis sector.\"\n\nMr Chapman has a history of acquiring significant positions in companies that he believes need help to be turned around and then shaking up the board and management teams of the companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the second time he has been a part owner of AusCann, having owned shares before its ASX listing in early 2017.\n\nBy late September, more than 17,300 people had been granted access under the special access scheme and monthly approvals had leapt from 331 in October 2018 to almost 3000.\n\nA report this year from Cannvalate said Australia had the fourth-largest cannabis market globally and more than 100,000 people had been turning to \"black market\" medical cannabis.\n\nAustralia has at least 20 listed cannabis companies; the largest by market capitalisation is Elixinol Global, which is valued at $284 million, but as recently as July it was worth more than double that.\n\nOther companies in the sector have also suffered losses since mid-year: Althea Group is down 47 per cent, while Cann Group is down 34.6 per cent.\n\nAusCann, which is led by former Teva Pharmaceuticals executive Ido Kanyon, is trading at its lowest point in the last year at just 32.5\u00a2, having sold for as much as 96\u00a2 per share a year ago. It has a market capitalisation of $103 million.", "description": "A tough regulatory environment has proved a buzzkill for the euphoria that drove listed medical cannabis stocks sky-high this year, but beaten up valuations are attracting new investors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/df43e79a2400f054b69040b3ab0eb3827f74d899", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
