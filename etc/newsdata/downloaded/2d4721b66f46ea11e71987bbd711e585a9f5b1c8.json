Recent years have brought historic droughts, more intense bushfires, devastating floods and the blanching of the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nAustralia's conservative government -- while stopping short of outright climate change denial -- has sought to frame the debate as a choice between jobs or abstract CO2 targets.\n\nRuling coalition parliamentarian Craig Kelly on Thursday warned children that \"everything you're told is a lie\".\n\n\"The facts are, there is no link between climate change and drought, polar bears are increasing in number,\" he said.\n\n- Businesses taking action -\n\nAn increasing number of businesses disagree.\n\n\"See you on the streets\" was the defiant message from Australian pension fund Future Super, which helped muster 2,000 companies behind \"not business as usual\" pro-strike campaign.\n\nIn a similar vein, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos on Thursday pledged to make the US technology and retail giant carbon neutral by 2040 and encourage other firms to do likewise.\n\nFriday's mass action sets the scene for a range of high-profile climate events in New York.\n\nA Youth Climate Summit will take place at the United Nations on Saturday.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will then host an emergency summit on Monday in which he will urge world leaders to raise their commitments made in the 2015 Paris climate accord.\n\nThe agreement saw countries pledge to limit the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth to two degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels, and if possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nThunberg, with her distinctive pigtail, took her message to the US Congress earlier this week to implore the nation's lawmakers to \"take real action\" to avert environmental disaster.\n\nShe also sat down with former US president Barack Obama, and received an Amnesty International award.", "description": "Children in Australia and the Pacific Islands kicked off a millions-strong global climate strike Friday -- heeding the rallying cry of teen activist Greta Thunberg and demanding adults take action to stave off environmental disaster.
