Yet Coppins reports that her all-but-assured ascendancy is now in jeopardy, a result of Ivanka\u2019s miscalculations on the global stage and the steady decline of her influence with her father. Trump grew exasperated with Ivanka and her husband\u2019s tireless efforts to change his mind about the Paris climate accord, and would mock their arguments when they were not around. \u201cThey\u2019re New York liberals,\u201d he would say, according to a former White House aide. \u201cOf course that\u2019s what they think.\u201d Ivanka\u2019s reputation was further diminished when a clip of her awkwardly attempting to mingle with world leaders at the G20 summit went viral in June, making her \u201can international punchline.\u201d The two and a half years she\u2019s spent trying to burnish her credentials haven\u2019t, in fact, turned her into a geopolitical player.\n\nIvanka\u2019s stumbles have been magnified by Don Jr.\u2019s rising popularity on the campaign circuit. Although a White House official told Coppins that he overheard the president referring to his namesake as \u201cnot the sharpest knife in the drawer,\u201d President Trump can\u2019t ignore his son\u2019s ability to draw MAGA crowds, a skill that\u2019s led some Republicans to speculate that Don Jr. could be the next Trump elected to office. According to Republicans familiar with discussions about his political future, Don Jr. has considered running for office somewhere in the Mountain West; other allies talk him up as a potential chairman of the Republican National Committee.\n\nAs he considers which of his children should carry on his legacy, Trump is caught between competing visions for the future of the family, Coppins reports\u2014one defined by a desire for elite approval, the other by an instinct for stoking populist rage. But unlike in business, where a patriarch can install a chosen heir as CEO, politicians often see their best-laid plans upended by voters. Coppins writes: \u201cFor Trump\u2014a distant and domineering father who has long pitted his offspring against one another\u2014the unsettling reality is that the choice of who will succeed him may be out of his control.\u201d\n\nRead \u201cSuccession\u201d at The Atlantic.
