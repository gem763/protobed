(AP) - Jim Harbaugh and the Michigan Wolverines have a chance to change the conversation.\n\nThe Wolverines were humiliated at Wisconsin, giving up five touchdowns before scoring late in the lopsided game. Michigan bounced back with a feel-good win over Rutgers, but beating a team struggling so much it fired its coach isn\u2019t going to make anyone forget what happened against the Badgers.\n\nIf Harbaugh can help the 19th-ranked Wolverines beat No. 14 Iowa on Saturday at home, however, it would be a sign that perhaps all is not lost for them this season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another test to show who we are,\u201d running back Tru Wilson said Monday. \u201cThey\u2019re all must-wins at this point.\u201d\n\nTo reach the team\u2019s lofty goals, and at least some preseason predictions, that is probably true.\n\nMichigan (3-1, 1-1 Big Ten) started the season with what seemed like a legitimate shot to win a conference championship for the first time since 2004 to end the longest drought in school history. Some projected Harbaugh\u2019s fifth team with the Wolverines to be contenders for their first national title since 1997.\n\nGetting routed at Wisconsin changed what people were saying outside the program.\n\nInside Schembechler Hall, coaches and players say their goals have not changed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long season,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt\u2019s one loss. It\u2019s happened to us before. It\u2019s happened to other teams before where they\u2019ve gone on and done great things after an early season loss. We have everything we have hoped and dreamed for still ahead of us. We still can do great things.\u201d\n\nThe Wolverines got a boost of confidence by beating the Scarlet Knights 52-0, but Harbaugh and the players aren\u2019t interested in celebrating the victory with tougher tasks ahead.\n\n\u201cIf you can play two really good games in a row that would be a trend in my mind,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cThree or more will become a habit so we\u2019re trying to cement that as a goal for us. That\u2019s where we want to be, consistently good.\u201d\n\nConsistently good is how Harbaugh described the Kirk Ferentz-led Hawkeyes (4-0, 1-0) while preparing to face them at the Big House.\n\nIowa has opened with four wins for the third time in 11 seasons, and history shows the team might be in line for a big season.\n\nThe last time the Hawkeyes opened 4-0 was in 2015, when they finished the regular season 12-0 before a last-second loss to Michigan State in the Big Ten title game.\n\nA decade ago, Iowa started 4-0 on its way to an 11-2 finish and an Orange Bowl win over Georgia Tech. The Hawkeyes might have won the Big Ten that year if standout quarterback Ricky Stanzi hadn\u2019t hurt his ankle in a home loss to Northwestern the week before a showdown at Ohio State. The Buckeyes beat Iowa and backup quarterback James Vandenberg 27-24 in overtime to seal a berth in the Rose Bowl.\n\nAnd this year, the Hawkeyes have Michigan\u2019s attention with NFL-caliber players on both sides of the ball.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be a test,\u201d defensive back Tyler Cochran said. \u201cThis is our opportunity to show we\u2019re better than what happened at Wisconsin and we\u2019re going to keep trying to show that the rest of the season.\u201d\n\nThe road doesn\u2019t get much easier for the Wolverines with games remaining at No. 12 Penn State, against No. 9 Notre Dame and No. 25 Michigan State before closing the regular season against rival and No. 4 Ohio State at home.\n\n\u201cOur schedule is all pretty much Top 25 teams for the remainder of the year,\u201d defensive tackle Carlo Kemp said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have opportunities to play a lot of good football teams.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Luke Meredith in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jim Harbaugh and the Michigan Wolverines have a chance to change the conversation.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Larry Lage"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/college_football_picks_21755_c0-280-4642-2986_s1770x1032.jpg?fed4e2db4a5642acee493cb264aba56a3280bad3", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
