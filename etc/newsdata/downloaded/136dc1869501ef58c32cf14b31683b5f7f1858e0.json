The album is currently at #1 on iTunes.\n\nThe tracks on \u201cJesus Is King\u201d deviate from West\u2019s prototypical style, as the album is gospel-themed and contains no cursing. According to his pastor, Adam Tyson, West had planned to give up rap music after converting to Christianity earlier this year, telling Tyson that the music genre is \u201cthe devil\u2019s music.\u201d\n\nWest\u2019s latest endeavors have been dominating the national conversation surrounding culture.\n\nImma let you finish but In 2009, if I asked you which of these ppl would go on to release an album about The Gospel and which would go on to advocate for late-term abortion, you would\u2019ve guessed wrong. pic.twitter.com/BLrpR3yn4s \u2014 matt\u2019s idea shop (@MattsIdeaShop) October 26, 2019\n\nWest\u2019s re-commitment to Christianity arrives on the heels of his public support for President Donald Trump, as well as criticism of policies enacted by the Democrat Party.\n\nIn a recent interview, West mentioned that \u201cwhite liberals\u201d attempt to convince him of revoking his support for President Trump, claiming that they \u201cdon\u2019t see anything Christian about [the president].\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, so last year, y\u2019all tried to tell me who I\u2019m supposed to vote for because I\u2019m black. Now this year, white liberals are trying to tell me who I\u2019m supposed to vote for, because I\u2019m Christian,\u201d said West.\n\n\u201cThey were fighting for us to have the right to our opinion, not the right to vote for whoever the white liberal said black people are supposed to vote for,\u201d said West.\n\n\u201cI have turned my back on the idea of victimization mentality,\u201d he added. \u201cThe culture has you focused so much on fucking somebody\u2019s bitch, and pulling up in a foreign [vehicle], and rapping about things that could get you locked up, and then saying you about prison reform \u2014 we brainwashed out here, bro.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemocrats had us voting democrat for food stamps for years,\u201d said West. \u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about? Guns in the 80\u2019s, taking the fathers outta the home, plan B, lowering our votes, making us abort our children. Thou shalt not kill.\u201d\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "Iconic jazz saxophonist Kenny G joined mega-rapper and fashion mogul Kanye West in Los Angeles for another one of West's Sunday Services.", "authors": ["Alana Mastrangelo"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/jesusalbumparty1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
