While both Mississippi and Kentucky are solidly Republican, having backed President Trump by about 19 and 30 points, respectively, in 2016, the races to win the governor\u2019s mansion are likely closer than the GOP would prefer.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe campaign touted Trump\u2019s economic accomplishments in its announcements of the Nov. 1 rally in Tupelo, Miss., and the Nov. 4 rally in Lexington, Ky.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has delivered for Mississippi, creating 20,800 jobs in the state since he was elected President,\u201d campaign chief operating officer Michael Glassner said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump continues to deliver for all Americans, and he looks forward to celebrating his achievements with the great men and women of Mississippi.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks to President Trump, Kentucky\u2019s economy is soaring, with 48,000 news jobs created since his election, including 7,400 manufacturing jobs,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, the rallies are likely to focus on the two gubernatorial races, which the GOP anxious to keep both states in its column. Trump has endorsed both Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves for election in Mississippi\u2019s open gubernatorial race and Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin for reelection.\n\n\u201cI need you to Get Out and Vote for our Great Republican nominee, @TateReeves. Tate is strong on Crime, tough on Illegal Immigration, and will protect your Second Amendment,\u201d Trump tweeted this week. \u201cHe loves our Military and supports our Vets!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 15, 2019\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nReeves is facing off against state Attorney General Jim Hood (D) to replace term-limited Gov. Phil Bryant (R). Public polling has shown Reeves with single-digit leads in a race the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan election handicapper, rated as \u201cLean\u201d Republican.\n\nReeves's campaign confirmed to The Hill that the lieutenant governor will appear at the Tupelo rally.\n\n\u201cI am proud to welcome @realDonaldTrump back to MS\u2014a state that is proud to stand behind our President.

Bevin only narrowly won the Republican nomination to get the chance to face off against Attorney General Andy Beshear (D).\n\nBevin remains unpopular in the Bluegrass State, with a recent survey conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy showing just 45 percent of voters approve of the job he's doing as governor, while 48 percent disapprove. The same survey finds Bevin and state Attorney General Andy Beshear (D) tied at 46 percent each, while the Cook Political Report rates the race as a \u201cToss Up.\u201d\n\nBevin has sought to cast himself as a staunch Trump ally in a state where the president remains popular. The Kentucky Republican\u2019s campaign also confirmed to The Hill that Bevin will appear with Trump at November\u2019s rally.\n\nTrump has relished the role of campaigner-in-chief during his time in the White House, seeking to buoy Republican candidates across the country. The president took credit for forcing Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) into a runoff after he failed to top 50 percent in last week\u2019s election following a rally the president held in the state.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s campaign announced Friday it will hold a rallies in Mississippi and Kentucky next month.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald3_101719getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
