We were fortunate for the last couple of years when Manu came back from injury, we just saw him grow in stature.\n\n'He probably grows the bigger the game as well.\n\n'He probably plays his best rugby in Tests, and that's the sign of a true champion player.\n\nToomua has identified Leicester team-mate Manu Tuilagi as a player for Australia to be wary of\n\n'Obviously Manu is a name that sticks out for a lot of reasons - he is a strong carrier and makes a lot of big plays. But it is probably trying to shut down his time and space.\n\n'He is at 12 now so he is a bit closer to the play, so it might be a little easier in that sense. I'm sure they're working out ways to give him some ball one-on-one at full steam.'", "description": "Asked by Sportsmail about his England mates George Ford, Jonny May, Ben Youngs, Dan Cole and Manu Tuilagi, the ex-Tigers playmaker said: 'I know all their weaknesses.'", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/12/19832812-0-image-a-22_1571310429968.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
