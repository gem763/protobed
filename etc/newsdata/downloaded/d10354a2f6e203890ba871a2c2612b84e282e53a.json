Back in 1980, the young couple simply wanted to go back to the land on a small farm with lush pastures in the Champlain Valley, about 45 minutes south of Burlington, growing vegetables and milking a few cows to feed themselves and make a little living.\n\nThey didn\u2019t know it then, but Orb Weaver, as that farmstead wheel came to be known, was Vermont\u2019s first artisan cheese \u2013 and Susman and Pollack were the mothers of a movement that\u2019s come to define the state as much as ski slopes and maple syrup.\n\nDespite the accolades Orb Weaver received over the years, the couple laid low, keeping production small and localized. But a few years ago, they realized that nearly four decades of year-round farming \u2013 milking cows and making cheese all winter, then turning their attention to organic vegetables in spring and summer \u2013had taken its toll.\n\nSusman and Pollack were ready to retire, but the veteran farmers didn\u2019t have any children to pass on the farm to, and they couldn\u2019t bear the thought of selling off their life\u2019s work and abandoning the home they\u2019d made there.\n\nOne of Orb Weaver's Jersey cows \u2014 Photo courtesy of Kate Turcotte\n\nLast year, Susman and Pollack officially stepped back from the milking parlor and the cheese cave, taking the first steps to transitioning the farm and cheesemaking business to a young dairying couple, Kate Turcotte and Zack Munzer. Turcotte spent several years heading up cheddar production at nearby Shelburne Farms, in addition to making cheese at Consider Bardwell Farm in southwest Vermont. It was there that she met Munzer, who works in breeding and herd management.\n\nBut the transition didn\u2019t happen overnight.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s notable that it happened at all \u2013 especially in the midst of a worsening dairy crisis that\u2019s seen hundreds of small and midsized farms in the Northeast forced to sell off herds and land in the past several years, even in dairy strongholds like New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.\n\nThough they\u2019d been warned by agricultural agencies who help with succession planning that agreements often fell apart at the last minute, both parties were determined to make it work.\n\n\"If we succeed, they succeed,\" Turcotte said of the multi-year courting process the couples went through. \"We both have a vested interest in making this continue.\"\n\nNow, going into the second year of Munzer and Turcotte\u2019s three-year lease \u2013 the initial step towards purchasing the farm \u2013they wouldn\u2019t have things any other way.\n\n\"I went from not really caring whether we were a one-generation farm to being so happy that they\u2019re doing this and taking over the name,\" Susman said. \"It makes me feel really great about it.\"\n\nThis past winter, Turcotte became the first person aside from Susman and Pollack ever to make the farm\u2019s signature cheese, stashing their aging rooms full of the original wax-dipped wheels as well as their cave-aged sisters, which are only made seasonally with winter\u2019s rich, fatty milk.\n\nDuring the same time, the original Orb Weavers began to enjoy their semi-retirement, sleeping in, taking tai chi classes and visiting friends.\n\n\"We rested after 40-odd years of working harder than we wanted,\" Pollack said. But they still work some: the couple continue to grow lettuces, tomatoes, peppers and other vegetables for local chefs and co-ops each summer.\n\nTurcotte has spent this season developing new recipes using the farm's award-winning milk, expanding Orb Weaver\u2019s menu of cheeses to go along with scaled-up production, while Munzer began expanding the herd.\n\nFrolic, the first new cheese made by Orb Weaver's second generation \u2014 Photo courtesy of Kate Turcotte\n\nNow, you can buy several styles of cheese from Orb Weaver Creamery, as the new business is called, aside from the original farmstead and its cave-aged sister. Each takes its name from one of the eight cows in Susman and Pollack\u2019s original herd.\n\nFirst came Frolic, a pudgy, buttery square with a heady funk thanks to its peachy-pink washed rind that\u2019s become a bestseller. Orbit, a sunny, sweeter Gouda-style wheel, highlights the herd\u2019s golden, grassy summertime milk. They\u2019ve added a blue cheese, too \u2013 a punchy cube with a deep golden paste and pockets of blue veining, called Ubu.\n\nThe new Orb Weavers are collaborating with other Vermont artisans, too. Whimsey is a rich, robiola-style button with a dose of funk courtesy of a bath in small-batch hard cider made at Windfall Orchards in nearby Cornwall (for a proper Addison County happy hour, pick up a bottle and taste them together). And, of course, Turcotte can\u2019t keep from making squeaky, snackable cheddar curds, perfected over her years at Shelburne Farm.\n\nWith the second generation in place, it\u2019s easier than ever to get your hands on Orb Weaver\u2019s once-elusive wheels at co-ops and cheese shops from Middlebury to Burlington to the Mad River Valley (imagine the apr\u00e8s-ski cheese board you could dig into). Follow Orb Weaver Creamery on Instagram for updates and info on where you can get your hands on them.\n\nThe young farmers also sell at the farmers\u2019 market in nearby Vergennes on Wednesday afternoons and the Shelburne Farmers' Market on Saturday mornings in season, sharing the history of Vermont\u2019s cheese culture and the taste of this special place with a growing number of tourists and locals alike.\n\n\"There\u2019s so much that\u2019s depressing about dairy and farm transitions,\" said Pollack. \"But this is a good story.\"", "description": "Nearly 40 years ago, Marjorie Susman and Marian Pollack began milking eight cows and growing organic vegetables on a small farm in western Vermont.
