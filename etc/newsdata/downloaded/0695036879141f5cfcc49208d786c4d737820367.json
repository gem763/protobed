Pictured: The map of one of the 27 sites he discovered dubbed Buenavista\n\nThis makes it easier to track down sites that would otherwise be difficult to find in ground-based surveys.\n\nHe scoured the laser map that covered 4,400 square miles of the Mexican states of Tabasco and Chiapas.\n\nDespite being low resolution he was able to identify a series of outlines that marked out archaeological sites which he identified as ceremonial grounds.\n\nHe scoured the laser map that covered 4,400 square miles of the Mexican states of Tabasco and Chiapas.

Pictured: The site called La Carmelita\n\n'It was great to see that there [are] more sites of this type than we expected.\n\n'It is also remarkable that they had very standardized rectangular formations,' Mr Inomata said when speaking to Fox News.\n\nHe added: 'The presence of these formal ceremonial complex in this early period indicates that certain rituals and religious ideas spread over a wide area as people accepted new ways of life.'\n\nAn aerial view of the La Carmelita site discovered by Mr Inomata as part of the discovery that he hopes will broaden understanding of the ancient civilisation\n\nThe pyramid in the Maya city of Moral Reforma in the Mexican state of Tabasco where human activity at the site was at its peak about 1,400 years ago\n\nHis discovery of 27 sites has not yet been peer-reviewed but he hopes it will ultimately prove invaluable for studies of the ancient culture.\n\nThe professor of archaeology at the University of Arizona made his breakthrough shortly after he carried out research at the site of Ceibal in Guatemala, where he found a ceremonial complex dating back to 1000 to 900 BC.\n\nThe map that Mr Inomata used was published in 2011 by Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography.", "description": "Takeshi Inomata stumbled across a\u00a0Light Detection and Ranging map (LiDAR) online last year that was free to use.
