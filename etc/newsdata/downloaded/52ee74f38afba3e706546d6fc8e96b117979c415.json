Waterson is a former Invicta atomweight champ who is small for the 115-pound class; Jedrzejczyk (15-3 MMA, 9-3 UFC) is a former UFC strawweight champ who has challenged for the flyweight belt.\n\nSo Waterson (17-6 MMA, 5-2 UFC) and her camp believe that by not giving in and allowing for the bout to be changed to a higher catchweight, she just may have called her opponent\u2019s bluff in an attempt to gain an edge.\n\n\u201cYou know, any advantage you can get as a fighter you\u2019re gonna try to get,\u201d Waterson told reporters, including MMA Junkie, at Wednesday\u2019s UFC Tampa open workouts. \u201cAnd I think that Joanna\u2019s been really good in her career in playing that psychological warfare an getting in her opponent\u2019s head before the fight even starts. Who knows, maybe she thought she wanted to have her cake and eat it to because of my kindhearted nature.\u201d\n\nWaterson admits that she was surprised when she first heard about Jedrzejczyk\u2019s issues, given there\u2019s nothing like this in her past.\n\n\u201cVery surprised, actually, because of Joanna\u2019s professionalism and this never happening before,\u201d Waterson said. \u201cWe knew that she was going to be the bigger girl Joanna\u2019s just always been a bigger 115er but we never in a million years thought that she wouldn\u2019t be make weight, so yeah, it\u2019s disheartening.\u201d\n\nGiven all the drama which has already gone down, there\u2019s still plenty of potential for surprised between now and the time the duo find themselves in opposite corners of the cage come Saturday night.\n\nWaterson has conceded that if Jedrzejczyk misses weight badly, her team could choose from a variety of demands, including financial compensation and monitoring JJ\u2019s weight on fight day before agreeing for the bout to go on.\n\nBut for now, Waterson just wants to wish Jedrzejczyk the best of luck in her weight cut, regardless of the circumstances.\n\n\u201cIm hoping it was just a moment of weakness on Joanna\u2019s part,\u201d Waterson said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m still hopeful that she pulls through and makes the weight on Friday because both of us have been preparing for this fight fight for quite a while now and I wouldn\u2019t want to disappoint the fans.\u201d\n\nUFC on ESPN+ 19 takes place Saturday at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Fla.
