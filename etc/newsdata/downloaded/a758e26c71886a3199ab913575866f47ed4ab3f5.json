While the attack did not disrupt the flow of oil from the Kingdom, the attempts \u201cunderscore the degree of difficulty in repelling aerial attacks\u201d, according to a separate note.\n\nThat\u2019s destined to put a floor under oil prices in the interim, Tran warned, with \u201cadditional potential attacks\u201d restricting the ability of Saudi Arabia to draw down its reserves to meet the shortfall.\n\nPresident Trump took to Twitter to signal the US could respond with force.\n\nSaudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\n\u201cThere is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed,\u201d Trump said.\n\nRead more: Trump says US is \u2018locked and loaded\u2019 in response to attack on Saudi oil supply\n\nIt comes after oil prices fell last week on the news that National Security Adviser John Bolton had departed the White House, leading to hopes that tensions with Iran would abate.\n\n\u201cOne thing we can say with confidence is that if that part of the reason for last week\u2019s fall in oil and improvement in geopolitical risk sentiment was the news of John Bolton\u2019s sacking\u2026 then it is no longer valid,\u201d National Australia Bank head of FX strategy Ray Attrill said in a note.\n\nThe currencies of major oil exporters Canada and Norway both rose 0.5% and 0.6% in response, while the Japanese yen, perceived as a safe-haven currency, rose more than 0.3% on the US dollar.\n\nWhile energy sectors are expected to rally on the news, the broader indices did not seem to be suffering as a result of the attack when the first began opening on Monday.\n\nAustralia\u2019s ASX 200 and China\u2019s Shanghai Composite were both trading flat, while Korea\u2019s KOSPI was up almost 0.5% as of 12 am EDT.
