She was held in custody for one night.\n\nHer bail conditions included a ban on her leaving the state of New South Wales and surrendering her passport to the court registry.\n\nShe was also banned from going within 500m of international points of departure and seeking to get her travel documents replaced - on top of a $50,000 bail security.\n\nOvernight, Ms Budge shared a happy snap of the Chelsea Square Market in New York City with her Instagram followers\n\nWhile stuck in Sydney, Ms Budge had publicly pined for New York and Paris - often posting 'daydreaming' photos on Instagram over the past two years.\n\nThe world is now open to her, given her stringent bail conditions lapsed last Wednesday when the jury quashed her charges.\n\nThe jury came to its verdict after an almost three-week trial, including four days of deliberations. The jurors found that prosecutors could not prove Ms Budge had knowledge that the weapon, or the ammunition, was in her possession.\n\nFor now, after two years from hell, it's time to relax and have fun.", "description": "The glamorous bar owner was  found not guilty of three gun possession charges just two weeks ago.", "authors": ["Brittany Chain", "Daniel Piotrowski For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/05/19425872-0-image-a-10_1570507867935.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
