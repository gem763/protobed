The data from our high net worth investor research is validated by the investment appetite and activity we are seeing in our private wealth client base.\"\n\nTrade war timidity\n\nNotwithstanding the uptick in optimism quarter-on-quarter, high net worth investors remained concerned about volatility in global markets and uncertainty emanating from international trade tensions.\n\nNearly half (49.7 per cent) of respondents said their investment and savings decisions were being influenced by the US-China trade war and prospects of a successful resolution.\n\n\"There is widespread belief that failure of the US to negotiate a trade deal would impact local investment markets adversely and has led high net worth investors to more conservative asset allocations,\" said Andrew Inwood, principal of research house CoreData, who conducted the survey on Westpac's behalf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most commonly cited recent investment for high net worth individuals was found to be cash, accounting for 42.6 per cent of responses, despite the low rate environment. Approximately one quarter (24.5 per cent) indicated their next investment would be in cash.\n\nJust 8.1 per cent of respondents suggested their next investment would be in international equities, although Westpac said its private wealth clients were relatively less conservative on international investment opportunities relative to peers.\n\n\"We have seen a consistent desire from investors to seek new areas of growth returns globally, with a recognition that targeted opportunities in areas that can be harder to access, such as less liquid opportunities, can present a more desirable risk and reward equation,\" said Mark Sherwood, New South Wales state director for Westpac Private Wealth.\n\nInvestor sentiment among mass affluent Australians, which are defined as those with between $50,000 and $750,000 in investable assets, was found to be more subdued, with an index score of -5.5, well below the 14.7 attributed to high net worth investors.", "description": "High net worth Australians are warming to the equities and property markets, off the back of US and domestic interest rate cuts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_97/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/195e16aa1068ee9cb3936bba01d3520916a6686e", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
