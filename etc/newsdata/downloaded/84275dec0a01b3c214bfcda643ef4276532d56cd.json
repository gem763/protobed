For Sanders, their overlapping bases may give him a small boost if Yang drops out of the race down the road or if he works to woo the so-called #YangGang.\n\nBut it\u2019s also a potential threat to Sanders even if Yang continues polling in the single digits. If Yang shaves off a few percentage points from Sanders\u2019 voting bloc, particularly in early-primary states such as New Hampshire, that could turn a second- or third-place finish into something worse.\n\n\u201cBernie understands that the country is in crisis,\u201d Zach Graumann, Yang\u2019s campaign manager, told POLITICO. \u201cThere's a lot of similar urgency and messaging that comes with that.\u201d\n\nThe intersection of Sanders and Yang supporters was highlighted last week when Sanders' former ad firm \u2014 Devine, Mulvey and Longabaugh \u2014 signed on with Yang's campaign. Mark Longabaugh, a partner at the company that produced Sanders\u2019 famous \u201cAmerica\u201d TV ad in 2016, told POLITICO that it chose Yang because \u201che\u2019s offering the most progressive ideas.\u201d The team had talks with at least one other presidential campaign about potentially working for it this cycle after splitting with Sanders earlier this year.\n\n\u201cHe wants to transform the economy into an economy focused on people rather than corporate profits. That's the sort of progressive bedrock candidate that we're drawn to,\u201d Longabaugh said. \u201cWhere a lot of candidates seem more negative and angry, I think Andrew comes to this displaying some optimism and a new way forward that could get this country to look to a new and better future. \u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders is no longer the sole progressive in the race like he was in 2016, nor is he the only anti-establishment contender. | Scott Heins/Getty Images\n\nThe Sanders-Yang overlap underscores another factor in the Democratic primary: While pundits frequently opine on \u201cmoderate\u201d and \u201cprogressive\u201d lanes, there's also an \u201canti-establishment\u201d lane in which Yang, Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Tulsi Gabbard, and Marianne Williamson are jockeying for support.\n\nJust as Sanders is no longer the sole progressive in the race like he was in 2016, he isn\u2019t the only anti-establishment contender anymore, either. Sanders seems to acknowledged as much.\n\n\u201cI like Andrew. Polling has shown my supporters support other candidates, polling has shown that other candidates' come over to us,\" he told POLITICO in an interview in Iowa on Friday. Sanders urged voters upset with the status quo to examine his decadeslong record of challenging the establishment: \"These ideas that I am advocating now \u2014 I think in fairness, I\u2019ve help transform politics in America \u2014 are not new ideas to me. I was out there fighting for Medicare for All 30 years ago.\u201d\n\nThe contest for disaffected voters could be particularly fierce in New Hampshire, where independents can participate in the primaries. Exit polls showed Sanders won independents in his first presidential bid, and expectations for him in New Hampshire are high after he defeated Hillary Clinton there by 22 percentage points in 2016. Yang has also sensed an opportunity in New Hampshire, visiting it five times in the past three months and more than 20 times total.\n\n\u201cThere is an intensity among the supporters of Andrew Yang that is very reminiscent of the Bernie supporters of 2016,\u201d said Ray Buckley, chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. \u201cThey\u2019re very passionate about their candidate, and they are very active online, both on Twitter and Facebook, in expressing their strong support.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Ray Buckley", "Chairman Of The New Hampshire Democratic Party"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f5/ad/3524586c4dc0868c1594084c3690/20191027-andrew-yang-rally-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
