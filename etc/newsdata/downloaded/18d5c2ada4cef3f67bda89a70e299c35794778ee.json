Although, her motives seem questionable and will no doubt lead to a series 2\u2026\n\nBen Chanan, the genius behind The Capture, explained to Metro.co.uk why Shaun\u2019s fate was sealed from the get-go, but Rachel\u2019s was a little more complicated.\n\n\u2018I knew that\u2019s how I was going to end it for Shaun, he told us. \u2018It had to be a sad ending. But there is a ray of hope \u2013 his ex is now talking to him, showing him pictures of her with the kid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Shaun doesn\u2019t care about other people; he cares about what his daughter thinks and his closest friends and relatives. He doesn\u2019t want his daughter thinking he\u2019s a murderer and he kidnapped her; Karen is going to make sure of that. So he gets that.\n\n\u2018I knew the system had to win. Shaun and Carey can\u2019t bring the system down \u2013 the system always wins.\u2019\n\nWill The Capture return for series 2? (Picture: BBC)\n\nBut Rachel\u2019s outcome wasn\u2019t a done deal even while filming the final scene, which saw the detective bursting into a private meeting with Danny Hart (Ben Miles) and DSU Gemma Garland (Lia Williams) to take a sudden U-turn and join the crusade to take down potential terror threats via any means possible \u2013 even if it means lying.\n\nBen revealed Holliday Granger actually filmed multiple endings.\n\n\u2018I knew she wasn\u2019t going to expose them, but I didn\u2019t know when I was writing it that she would join them,\u2019 he continued. \u2018We did a lot of takes \u2013 that last shot of her walking in we did a lot of takes. We actually did a lot of versions of that to play around with the intention and that was a lot of fun.\n\nHe added: \u2018What I liked about the plot was its ambiguity.\u2019\n\nThe showrunner also hinted that a series 2 is being spoken about, though he couldn\u2019t \u2018confirm or deny\u2019. However, he did admit tonight\u2019s cliff-hanger leaves questions that surely need to be answered\u2026\n\nThe Capture is available to stream on BBC iPlayer now.", "description": "The Capture alternative endings for Rachel Carey after finale", "authors": ["Adam Miller"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89007672_1570550969.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
