We would like to urge the public and the media to give the family space and time to mourn his passing privately. The family will not be conducting any interviews,\u201d Leshabane said.\n\nWhen news broke this morning that Watson had been killed in a car accident, the authorities were mum, preferring not to comment until the family had been notified.\n\nAccording to the police the 73-year-old man, believed to be Watson, was driving into the airport precinct when \u201che allegedly lost control of his vehicle and collided with a concrete pillar holding up a highway bridge.\u201d\n\nWatson was pronounced dead on the scene by paramedics and a case of culpable homicide was opened by the police service for further investigation.\n\nPolice spokesperson Colonel Katlego Mogale told City Press that, while the identity was yet to be revealed as the next-of-kin was not yet notified, the accident took place at about 5:30am and the driver, who was in a Toyota Corolla, was alone.\n\nState capture\n\nWatson\u2019s name became a household one during the Zondo commission of inquiry, which was hearing allegations of state capture.\n\nThe revelations were first brought to the country\u2019s attention by former Bosasa chief operations officer Angelo Agrizzi, who apparently had a serious falling-out with Watson, who was his boss and chief executive of management solutions company Bosasa.\n\nIt was during Agrizzi\u2019s testimony the country learnt of the close relationship Watson had with former president Jacob Zuma. Agrizzi painted Zuma as an intellectual dwarf who was dancing to Watson\u2019s money-power tune.\n\nAgrizzi was the Hawks\u2019 key witness to bringing down Watson.\n\nRead: Bosasa accused in court as case against Watson builds\n\nCity Press reported earlier this year that Hawks discussions with Agrizzi had been going on for a long time before he appeared before the Zondo commission.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe discussions have been ongoing for a long time before Agrizzi could testify before the Zondo commission of inquiry. There are talks of giving him immunity and of him turning state witness in return for testifying against Watson,\u201d said a security cluster source familiar with discussions.\n\nAgrizzi himself faces charges of corruption, money laundering and fraud, and appeared in the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Unit with other Bosasa executives.\n\nThe millions\n\nWatson allegedly offered R50 million in start-up capital to his former right-hand man to buy his silence.\n\nRead: Agrizzi turns down Watson\u2019s R50 million shut up deal\n\nThis offer came three days after Agrizzi threatened to go public with details of alleged corruption that took place during his 18 years at the company.\n\n\n\nThe Bosasa boss allegedly tried to convince Agrizzi to change his mind at a meeting on August 25 last year.\n\nAgrizzi has made some explosive allegations at the Zondo commission about the \u201cracketeering, corruption and money laundering\u201d that allegedly took place there over the \u201clast 18 years\u201d.\n\nStruggle icon\n\nBut Watson and his brothers were lauded as struggle icons during the apartheid era before falling foul of the law.\n\nThe four brothers \u2013 Dan, Valence, Ronnie and Gavin \u2013 who were born on a farm in the Eastern Cape, spoke fluent isiXhosa and were raised by a preacher who taught them that everybody was equal. They have always been regarded as struggle giants in the Eastern Cape.\n\nRead: Bosasa CEO Gavin and his brothers \u2013 who are the Watsons?\n\nAfter 1994, they immersed themselves in the business of black economic empowerment.\n\n\n\nGavin\u2019s brothers Valence and Ronnie joined the Kebble mining empire, while Gavin started Bosasa, which had a number of subsidiaries \u2013 including Sondolo IT, Phezulu Fencing and Leading Prospect Trading.\n\nThe Bosasa group won government tenders to provide food and security to prisons, to feed and transport refugees at the Lindela Repatriation Centre in Krugersdorp, and to provide security at the country\u2019s courts and airports.\n\nA rugby official, familiar with their forays into Port Elizabeth\u2019s townships to play for Spring Rose rugby club, told City Press earlier this year about their willingness to go against the grain.\n\n\u201cIt was totally unthinkable what they did,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey could have been charged for being in the township, but they did it anyway. They got a lot of attention from the Special Branch for that. But at the time, you could not make a more anti-racist statement than to play rugby in the townships.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine the social backlash they received from the white community? I believe that stalked Cheeky when he became EP president \u2013 he was never forgiven among the whites, and it showed in his failure to get sponsorship for the team from corporate business in Port Elizabeth.\u201d\n\nThere was talk at the time that the Watsons\u2019 struggle had less to do with altruism than it did with protecting their men\u2019s fashion shop, which sold mostly to black customers, at a time when businesses were being burnt in the uprisings.\n\nSaid the official: \u201cThere will be a lot of people rejoicing about this [Gavin\u2019s pending legal woes] because it would confirm a view they held back then. In a sense, this would be a self-fulfilling prophecy.\u201d", "description": "Gavin Watson will probably go down in history as the man who masterminded a huge part of the state capture scandal that rocked South Africa.", "authors": ["City Press Reporters"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9162/532e5a8d9bbf4504bc04ba2477b25250.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-26"}
