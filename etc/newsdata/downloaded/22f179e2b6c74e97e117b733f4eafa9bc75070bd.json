DOW recently announced the development of AGILITY CE \u2014 the first post-consumer recycled (PCR) product in its plastics circularity portfolio to integrate high percentage of post-consumer plastic waste. The new resin is made with 70% recycled plastic.\n\n\n\nThe resin\u2019s composition also includes low-density polyethylene (LDPE). A recycled plastic shrink film is used in the final product without compromising material consistency or functionality.\n\n\n\nThis is the first grade of AGILITY CE that will be used as secondary packaging for the shipment of cans or bottles in collation shrink films. This helps converters to integrate more than 50% of recycled content into the final film formulation without modifying its usability. The high-quality recyclate will enable retailers and brand owners to achieve sustainability targets as well as reduce landfill waste.\n\n\n\nPer Dow, AGILITY CE will be a consistent and high-quality product that is different from previous mechanically-recycled content that has often diminished or degraded in quality. The company plans to showcase AGILITY CE as well as many other technologies to its customers at K 2019 from Oct 16-23 in Dusseldorf, Germany.\n\n\n\nThe company continues to work toward a system that will facilitate the reuse of secondary and transport packaging films into the same type of application. This breakthrough is another example of Dow's strategy to make it possible for plastics to migrate to a circular economy. To achieve the same, the company is concentrating on resource efficiency as well as incorporating recycled content and sustainable feedstocks into its production processes.\n\n\n\nDow, in August, announced a partnership with Fuenix Ecogy Group that is based in Weert, The Netherlands, to supply pyrolysis oil feedstock made from recycled plastic waste. The agreement is a major step to increase feedstock recycling, which breaks down mixed waste plastics into their original form to produce new virgin polymers. Dow also entered into a partnership with UPM to incorporate wood-based renewable naphtha into its raw material slate, providing an alternative source of plastic feedstock.\n\n\n\nDow\u2019s shares have declined around 7.8% in the past three months compared with the roughly 7.2% fall recorded by the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn second-quarter 2019 earnings call, the company stated that the pace of global economic growth has slowed as buying patterns remain cautious amid trade and geopolitical uncertainties.\n\n\n\nAgainst the backdrop, the company is focused on maintaining cost and operational discipline through cost synergy as well as stranded cost-removal initiatives. The company noted that it is lowering its planned capital spending for 2019 to $2 billion from $2.5 billion considering prevailing market environment.\n\n\n\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\n\n\n\nDow currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\n\n\nSome better-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space include Kinross Gold Corporation KGC, AngloGold Ashanti Limited AU and Alamos Gold Inc AGI, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
