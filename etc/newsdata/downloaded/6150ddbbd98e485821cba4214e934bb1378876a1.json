It has faithfully followed its policies and procedures and responded appropriately to abuse complaints, and is committed to supporting victims-survivors of abuse,\" Jones wrote in a summary of her findings which was released Monday morning.\n\nThe most significant of the recommendations that Jones called for was the hiring of an individual whose sole job will be to oversee how the archdiocese responds to sexual abuse allegations, and to increase safe environment training both in terms of who goes through the training and how often.\n\nABC News\n\nShe also called for improvements to an existing database that would allow for easier updating and tracking of individuals' information which \"will help [the] communication and information flow between the parishes and other organizations,\" Jones said at a news conference Monday. \"This is vital.\"\n\nDolan was also at the news conference and said he had been almost holding his breath for the findings of the report.\n\n\"I've asked them... not to leave a paper unread and I've held by breath. I'm very grateful and very relieved,\" Dolan said of the findings.\n\n\"I'm trying my best to serve my people. I love them and my main job is to serve them,\" Dolan said.\n\nZach Hiner, the executive director of The Survivor's Network, also known as SNAP, told ABC News that \"it is good\" that Jones \"feels confident in her assessment\" and he said that they are glad that Dolan, \"to the best of Judge Jones' knowledge, has been transparent with her efforts.\"\n\n\"I truly hope that she did receive full access to personnel files,\" Hiner said.\n\nHe did take issue with some of the language in the report summary, however.\n\n\"In terms of Judge Jones\u2019 recommendations, it is distressing to learn that reports of 'sexual abuse from non-consenting adults' \u2013 carefully sanitized language for the crime of rape \u2013 or allegations of abuse by church staff or volunteers are not already included in the Archdiocese\u2019s reporting requirements. These are obvious crimes that should be reported, and it is disappointing that it took a legal review by a judge in 2019 to make this plain. To us, someone who is in 'full compliance' with the charter would already have gone the extra mile to include these crimes underneath the 'zero-tolerance' umbrella,\" Hiner said in his statement to ABC.\n\nThe review of the archdiocese's policies comes at a turbulent time in New York, in particular, as a year-long window opened in August that allows for any victims of child abuse to file civil complaints against accusers regardless of any statutes of limitations in those cases. Hundreds of such lawsuits have been filed since the New York's Child Victim's Act window opened on Aug. 14.", "description": "A review of how the Archdiocese of New York was handling sexual abuse allegations prompted some recommendations but found that overall they have been following the rules.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/dolan-abc-jt-190930_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
