The 30-year-old has been unable to get a visa to the United States, she announced on her Instagram page Monday morning.\n\nThe post from Zhang can be seen below:\n\nZhang\u2019s post did not go unnoticed by the powers that be. United States Representative for Hawaii\u2019s 2nd district and Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard has reached out in an effort to get the UFC champion clearance to travel to the U.S., according to a comment by Zhang on her original post.\n\n\u201cWow!\u201d Zhang wrote. \u201cI just received news from my manager that miss @tulsigabbard contacted him to try and help us. Thank you thank you miss Tulsi\u201d\n\nIn a quote posted on by Zhang\u2019s manager Brian Butler on his Instagram story, Gabbard told them the following, \u201cWe need more ties and partnerships between our two countries in spit of the differences. MMA is an amazing way to do that.\u201d\n\nIn a statement given to MMA Junkie, Butler clarified the recent sequence of events:\n\n\u201cAt this time we have been denied a visa to come here for the media tour next week. We believe that there was some miscommunication of some sort that caused red flags to raise to cause the denial. We are not quite sure what that is but we are working through the process as we speak. The UFC legal department is working on it and presidential candidate/congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard also responded to me and is trying to help on her end.\u201d", "description": "U.S. representative and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard has reached out in an effort to get UFC champion Weili Zhang clearance.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Matt Erickson", "Ken Hathaway", "Simon Head", "George Garcia", "Farah Hannoun", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/weili-zhang-tulsi-gabbard.jpeg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
