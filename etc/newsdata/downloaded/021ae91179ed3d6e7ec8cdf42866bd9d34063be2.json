Net migration measures the number of people who moved into the metro area from some other part of the US or another country, minus the number of people who left the metro area over that period.\n\nReinforcing a theme we've seen in other measures, Americans are flocking to the South. An overwhelming majority of the top 20 metro areas for migration are in the south, with over half in Florida alone.\n\nHere are the 20 metro areas with the highest net migration between 2010 and 2018 as a share of 2010 population:", "description": "Big cities in the South have seen a lot of growth from people moving in since 2010 \u2014\u00a0and over half of the top metro areas are in Florida.", "authors": ["Andy Kiersz"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d851cd42e22af500e3ec56e-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
