The NFL is proceeding carefully and wants to be certain that, if it does place Brown on paid leave, its procedures and reasoning are sound and defensible, according to those people.\n\nJenkins: I don\u2019t know what Antonio Brown did, but he\u2019s already damned by misogynist language\n\nThe NFL\u2019s investigation \u201cwill take a little time\u201d but the league hopes to be in position relatively soon to make a decision about the exempt list, one of those people said. It\u2019s not clear if that means that a decision will be made next week. It could take longer than that depending on what the league\u2019s investigation finds, according to the people close to the situation.\n\nBrown has been accused of rape and sexual assault in a lawsuit in Florida by a former college classmate who worked for Brown as his trainer. He has denied the allegations through his attorney and he has not been charged with a crime.\n\nHis accuser, Britney Taylor, is expected to meet next week with NFL representatives, according to multiple people familiar with the situation. That meeting reportedly could not take place sooner because of her wedding.\n\nNFL investigators also are seeking to interview other potential witnesses and are gathering other evidence, according to those with knowledge of the case. Brown is expected to be interviewed at some point.\n\nPatriots Coach Bill Belichick declined to say Friday whether Brown will play Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do what\u2019s best for the team,\u201d Belichick said at his daily media briefing in Foxborough, Mass.\n\nThe Patriots play Sunday at Miami. Brown practiced with the team this week after agreeing to a one-year contract with the Patriots last Saturday, hours after being released by the Oakland Raiders. The Patriots announced the deal Tuesday.\n\nIf Brown is placed on the exempt list, he would be paid but would not be permitted to practice with the Patriots or attend games. He would be allowed to be at the Patriots\u2019 facilities to participate in meetings and workouts and undergo medical treatment. He would have the right to appeal his placement on the exempt list.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nCam Newton doesn\u2019t look right and the Panthers are in trouble after losing at home to the Bucs\n\nLamar Jackson, Baker Mayfield and the dangers of judging quarterbacks too early\n\nBest bets for NFL Week 2: Take the Dolphins and the points against the Patriots\n\nIt\u2019s the bottom of the ninth for Raiders games on a baseball field\n\nBrowns ban fan for dumping beer on Titans player.
