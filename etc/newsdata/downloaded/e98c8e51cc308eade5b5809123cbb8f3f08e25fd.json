He said that there are communists involved and you guys might like that. I mean, this was not a dialogue. It was sort of a diatribe, a nasty diatribe,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer Steny Hamilton HoyerOvernight Health Care \u2014 Presented by National Taxpayers Union \u2014 Buttigieg targets Warren, Sanders on health care ahead of debate | Judge overturns ObamaCare transgender protections | Poll sees support drop for 'Medicare for All' Hillicon Valley: Google, Reddit to testify on tech industry protections | Trump joins Amazon-owned Twitch | House to vote on bill to combat foreign interference Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Judge blocks Trump 'public charge' rule | Appeals court skeptical of Trump arguments for Medicaid work requirements | CDC offers guidance for treating vaping-related cases MORE (D-Md.) also said the attendees \"were offended deeply\" by Trump\u2019s treatment of Pelosi.\n\nHoyer, Schumer and Pelosi said they left the meeting after Trump\u2019s comments to Pelosi but that other lawmakers in both parties stayed behind to continue asking questions about Syria and Turkey.\n\n\u201cThis crisis required a rational, reasonable discussion between those of us who have been elected by the American people to set policy,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cUnfortunately, the meeting deteriorated.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin Owen McCarthy10 top Republicans who continue to deny the undeniable Furious Republicans prepare to rebuke Trump on Syria Five ways Trump's Syria decision spells trouble MORE (R-Calif) and Rep.

And the secretary of Defense was, thank god he was honest. He said, \u2018We don\u2019t have that evidence,\u2019\u201d Schumer said.\n\n\u201cThis is appalling,\u201d Schumer added. \u201cThe president had no plan, no real plan for containing ISIS.\u201d\n\nSchumer pushed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellTrump-GOP tensions over Syria show signs of easing Trump again vetoes resolution blocking national emergency for border wall Trump invites congressional leaders to meeting on Turkey MORE (R-Ky.) to put the resolution the House passed Wednesday on the Senate floor.
