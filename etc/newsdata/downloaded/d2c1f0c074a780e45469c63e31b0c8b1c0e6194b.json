As Colbert explained, Pence personally pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate \u201ccorruption,\u201d which he \u201chad to have known\u201d meant Biden because he was given a transcript of Trump\u2019s original phone call before that meeting.\n\nTrevor Noah Exposes Mike Pence\u2019s Absurd Ukraine Excuses\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s his excuse?\u201d Colbert asked. \u201cOfficials close to Pence say Pence met with [Volodymyr] Zelensky \u2018probably without having read\u2014or at least fully registered the transcript,\u2019\u201d he added, quoting from a Washington Post report.\n\n\u201cSo he probably didn\u2019t \u2018read\u2019 the crime,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cUnless he did, in which case he probably didn\u2019t understand the crime.\u201d He compared the vice president to someone who tries to get out of a ticket by claiming, \u201cI probably didn\u2019t read the stop sign, or if I did, I didn\u2019t register what it said. How could I? I was doing 90 through that school zone.\u201d\n\nColbert ultimately concluded that Pence can only be a either a \u201cparticipant or a patsy,\u201d which led him to a round of \u201cAmerica\u2019s favorite game: Corrupt or Dumb.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s find out, is this member of the Trump administration corrupt or dumb?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd\u2026 it\u2019s both!\u201d\n\nRachel Maddow Predicts Senate GOP May Just Find Its \u2018Conscience\u2019 and Impeach Trump\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
