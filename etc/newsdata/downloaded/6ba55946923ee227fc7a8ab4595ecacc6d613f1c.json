I have the mortgage. That is all there is. Very simple. I am the bank.\" The piece by Russ Choma of Mother Jones examines the loan held by a Trump Organization company called, of which Trump told The New York Times in 2016: \"We don\u2019t assess any value to it because we don\u2019t care. I have the mortgage. That is all there is. Very simple. I am the bank.\"\n\nA personal financial disclosure filed by the president indicates the loan in question earns no revenue, suggesting he pays no interest on it, and identifies it as a \"springing loan\", a classification that allows the owner to impose harsh repayment terms, something Trump would hardly be likely to inflict on himself.\n\nThe creditor from whom he acquired the $50m is not identified, but he is known to have received $640m (\u00a3520m) from Deutsche Bank and another $130m (\u00a3106m) from Fortress Investment Group towards the Chicago development. Both are possible sources for the money.\n\nTrump's project was hit by disaster when the financial crisis struck in 2008, leaving him facing $800m (\u00a3650m) in debt and about to default on a payment of $330m (\u00a3268m) to Deutsche, at which point he brazenly sued them for causing the economic meltdown. He eventually wiggled out of that situation by getting a new loan from the German bank's private lending arm to pay off its commercial division, seemingly doing so without purchasing any debt.\n\nThat leaves Fortress, which accepted a 50 cents on the dollar repayment plan from Trump, netting them $48m (\u00a339m) instead of $100m (\u00a381m). That deal could have represented a \"discounted payoff\" - accounting for the mystery loan, assuming it was written off as a debt repaid - unless, alternatively, Trump purchased the debt back.\n\nIn that case, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would consider the $50m as money earned and thus taxable income. Trump could have got around this by getting a corporation to purchase the debt from him, a tactic known as \"debt parking\". This is a legal grey area - to debt park on a temporary basis is tolerated but it must eventually be repaid. To not do so is to violate federal tax laws.\n\n\u201cIf he didn\u2019t actually buy the loan, this is just garden-variety fraud,\u201d Georgetown law professor Adam Levitin tells Choma.", "description": "Donald Trump was so incensed by reporting\u00a0over his erroneous\u00a0suggestion Hurricane Dorian could have hit Alabama that he summoned Fox News correspondent John Roberts to the Oval Office on Thursday to argue about the gaffe, according to CNN, part of a day spent obsessing over the matter on Twitter.", "authors": ["Chris Riotta", "Joe Sommerlad"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/06/09/donald-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
