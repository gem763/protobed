I think that our weapons are sold everywhere around the world, including to Turkey, and I think they should be made contingent on behavior, and you don\u2019t get our high-tech weapons, our high-tech fighter planes unless you behave like an ally. And lately, Turkey has not been behaving like an ally.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019ll definitely support withholding arms.\u201d\n\nRand also expressed skepticism about sanctioning Turkey because sanctions hurt Turkey\u2019s population and can turn the nation\u2019s populace against the U.S.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "description": "On Monday's broadcast of Fox News Radio's \"Brian Kilmeade Show,\" Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) stated that he supports withholding arms sales to Turkey, but is | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/01/wi/afp/30/5aced8_rand-paul-junior-senator-us-state-kentucky-was-assaulted-by-neighbor-in-e1551809799499.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
