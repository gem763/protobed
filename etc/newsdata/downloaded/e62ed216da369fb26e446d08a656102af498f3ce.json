I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d the Nigerian national added.\n\nA former detainee who was close with Mr Okwurime while he was in Harmondsworth said his friend hadn\u2019t been feeling well and that he had wanted to see a doctor but that \u201cthis was not a quick process\u201d in the detention centre.\n\nThe man, who did not want to be named, was released from the centre the night before Mr Okwurime died.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferences Register with your social account or click here to log in I would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email Update newsletter preferences\n\nNews of his friend\u2019s death came as a shock to him because Mr Okwurime had walked him to the gate to see him off just hours earlier.\n\n\u201cHe carried one of my bags. We were laughing together. Then I called him up early in the morning, just to chat, and he didn\u2019t answer and then later on someone called me to say he had died. I\u2019m still in shock now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard he was screaming. There\u2019s a button in the room but they don\u2019t always come. They\u2019re supposed to check through the door in the night. Why didn\u2019t he get help on time?\u201d\n\nMr Okwurime was a \u201cvery intelligent\u201d and \u201ceasy-going\u201d person and his death had left him \u201cheartbroken\u201d, the former detainee said.\n\n\u201cWas he suffering from high pressure? I remember him telling me that when they detained him the nurse who checked his blood pressure, in his words, jumped off his seat because his blood pressure was so high. But they never checked up on him,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMaybe it was a heart attack, maybe high blood pressure. Whatever ailment he had, being in detention triggered it.\u201d\n\nAnother detainee, Juskin Eniolorunda, said Mr Okwurime had told him he felt unwell and had been trying to get an appointment with the nurse.\n\nThe 42-year-old said his friend \u201dwas a jovial person. He was cool. He was young in age, but very mature.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI don\u2019t think he had ever been locked up in his life. Not everyone can get used to this. He didn\u2019t commit any crime, nothing. Why do they keep doing this to people? It makes me feel so bad. No one can hear our voice.\u201d\n\nEmma Ginn, director of the Medical Justice charity, said Mr Okwurime\u2019s death was \u201ca tragedy\u201d that was \u201cacutely felt by detainees left behind, locked in immigration removal centres\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cIndefinite detention coupled with inadequate healthcare can exacerbate detainees\u2019 existing medical condition can and be the cause of mental illness. The Home Office is well aware of the issues.\u201d\n\nLucy McKay, policy and communications officer at the Inquest charity, said a number of recent inquiries had exposed the \u201cdismissive\u201d culture of healthcare and detention staff in immigration removal centres, as well as the human cost of indefinite detention.\n\nShe added: \u201cBereaved families and their legal teams face long and complex battles to get to the truth of what happened in these cases, and are constantly faced with a response of denial, delay and obfuscation from the Home Office.\u201d\n\nIt comes as the High Court halted the removal of three men who may be able to provide evidence about Mr Okwurime\u2019s death. They had been set to be put on a charter flight in Tuesday night.\n\nBut the court refused to widen this order to other detainees on the flight for whom it had not yet been established whether they could provide information about the death.\n\nIt comes after the government rejected widespread calls to end the indefinite detention of immigrants in the UK, claiming a time limit would \u201cseverely constrain\u201d the ability to maintain effective immigration control.\n\nIn July, former Conservative cabinet ministers attacked the Home Office over its refusal to introduce a time limit on immigration detention, saying locking people up indefinitely was \u201cclearly perverse\u201d.\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said that as the death was subject to investigation, it would be inappropriate to comment further on the case.\n\nThey added: \u201cAny death in detention is a tragic event and our thoughts and condolences are with the family and friends of Mr Okwurime.\u201d", "description": "A Nigerian man who died in a British\u00a0detention centre\u00a0repeatedly said\u00a0he felt unwell but was not seen by a medical professional, his family have claimed.\u00a0 Oscar Okwurime, 34, was discovered lying in his cell at the Harmondsworth removal centre by another detainee last week. The cause of his death is unknown but\u00a0the Home Office said it was being investigated.", "authors": ["May Bulman"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/09/08/16/gettyimages-72669789-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
