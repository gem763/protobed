(Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nJust three times in League Championship Series history has a team lost the first two games, and won the series, and only once since 1985.\n\nThe Yankees, of course, were that lone exception in the last 34 years, blowing a 3-0 lead to the Boston Red Sox in 2004.\n\nThe Yankees were confident they had the game in hand when it became a battle of the bullpens. Why, after starter James Paxton departed after just 2 \u2153 innings, they used eight different relievers, who gave up just two hits until the 11th inning.\n\nThe Astros tied the game 2-2 on George Springer\u2019s leadoff homer in the fifth, his 12th postseason homer overall, the most in Astros\u2019 history.\n\nAaron Judge gave the Yankees a 2-1 lead in the fourth inning with a two-run homer, which was Verlander\u2019s only major mistake in his 6 \u2154 inning brilliant performance.\n\nIt was Judge\u2019s eighth postseason homer in 23 games, with only Lou Gehrig hitting more (9) in his first 25 postseason games in Yankee history.\n\nHe has been a one-man power show, particularly with Giancarlo Stanton hurt again, out of the Yankees\u2019 starting lineup with a strained quadriceps.\n\nStill, it was not enough to stop the Astros, who will spend all winter talking about shortstop Correa\u2019s game-saving play in the sixth inning.\n\nThe Yankees, with runners on first and second, hit their first groundball of the game with Brett Gardner\u2019s hard shot to second baseman Jose Altuve. The ball caromed off Altuve\u2019s glove and bounced to his right.\n\nYankees third base coach Phil Nevin, wanting to take advantage of the blunder, waved D.J. LeMahieu home.\n\nNever did he realize that Correa would alertly pick up the ball, fire home, and nail LeMahieu by 10 feet.\n\nThe crowd roared, and Verlander pumped his fist dancing off the mound, keeping the game tied at 2-apiece.\n\nVerlander, the likely Cy Young winner, once again was superb, with his only real mistake that fat slider over the middle of the plate Judge sent 423 feet over the center-field wall.\n\nOtherwise, Verlander tormented the Yankees.\n\nOnce again.\n\nVerlander remains undefeated, 4-0, in seven career starts against the Yankees. In his 12 postseason appearances with the Astros since 2017, he 7-3 with a 2.90 ERA, striking out 75 in 71 \u2153innings.\n\nThanks to Alvarez\u2019s heroics, he likely will pitch again in Game 6.\n\nPerhaps, to close out the series.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "Carlos Correa hits a walk-off home run in the 11th inning as the Astros even the series with the Yankees 1-1.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published A.M.
