Its next tenant will be \"Girl from the North Country\" in March. Broadway producers lately have been creative about using the theater spaces when vacant, including programing concerts, magic shows and improv performances.\n\nWhile unprecedented these days, turning the 1,000-seat Belasco into a movie house is an echo from the past. Almost every Broadway theater that is still standing was converted to showing movies, recording radio broadcasts, or being used as a TV recording studio at some point in Times Square's seedier days, says Tim Dolan, a Broadway historian who is owner of the Broadway Up Close Walking Tours Inc.\n\nThe mobster flick \"The Irishman\" stars Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. It represents a big risk for Netflix, which ponied up $159 million to make \"The Irishman\" after other studios passed.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
