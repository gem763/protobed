Attorney General William Barr had the option of invoking a \"state secrets\" privilege to withhold the name but chose not to do so, citing the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d involved in the deadliest terror attack in U.S. history.\n\nZAWAHIRI MARKS 9/11 ANNIVERSARY BY CALLING FOR JIHADIST ATTACKS ON US, ISRAEL\n\n\"This is a good result,\" Terry Strada, national chair of 9/11 Families and Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism, said in a statement. \"The families are dedicated to getting to the truth, and we shouldn't have to beg for this sort of basic information, or be kept in the dark, about the Saudi role in the attacks.\"\n\nThe name in question was redacted from a 2012 FBI document describing assistance given to two of the hijackers in Southern California. Lawyers for 9/11 survivors and victims' relatives suspect the name belongs to a Saudi official they say tasked two men connected to the Riyadh government with helping the hijackers find housing, obtain driver\u2019s licenses and more.\n\nThe Saudi government has repeatedly denied any involvement in the attacks. Of the 19 Al Qaeda attackers who hijacked the four planes, 15 were Saudi nationals.\n\nThe 9/11 Commission report found \"no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded\" the attacks that Al Qaeda masterminded, but the commission also noted \"the likelihood\" that Saudi government-sponsored charities did.\n\n9/11: IMAGES OF THE ATTACK THAT CHANGED THE WORLD\n\nThe plaintiffs note that much more information has come to light since that report, and the existence of the FBI report in 2012 shows that authorities were continuing to investigate years after the attack.\n\nThe individual\u2019s name was the families\u2019 top priority in the subpoena. Still, the FBI did not disclose other information requested in the suit. Barr did invoke \"state secrets\" to block the release of other information in that report that he says could harm national security if released.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe lawsuit against the Saudis was first brought in New York federal court in 2003, but it has gained traction in recent years. A 2016 law permits foreign governments to be held liable in American courts for acts of terrorism. And a judge last year rejected a Saudi request to dismiss the case and instead ordered discovery into whether the government had a role in the attacks.\n\nThe release of the information publicly could be received coldly by President Trump, who attempts to maintain close ties to the Saudi government, which he has said is an important ally in the region and supports the U.S. defense industry with billions in arms purchases.", "description": "The Justice Department decided Thursday that it would reveal a key new\u00a0development in a lawsuit against Saudi Arabia for its alleged involvement in the 9/11 attacks - the previously redacted identity of an individual believed to be connected to the Saudi government who aided the hijackers.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/911.gary_.jpg"}
