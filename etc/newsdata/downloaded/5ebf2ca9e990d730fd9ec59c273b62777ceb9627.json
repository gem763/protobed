Several thousand people have fallen victim to identity theft using fraudulent porting of a mobile number and on average the amount that has been lost is over $10,000 \u2013 as well as all the time and inconvenience that is involved in re-establishing control of what is rightfully your mobile number.\"\n\nThe Australian Taxation Office is among the government agencies working to fight the phone scams, which include the sophisticated \"spoofing\" of ATO phone numbers, designed to give taxpayers the impression that demands for urgent repayment of debt or investigations are legitimate.\n\nThe ATO has received more than 114,000 reports of scams and estimates the annual losses for victims at $3 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission recently said losses reported to the Scamwatch service were likely to reach $532 million in 2019.\n\nExperts believe that about one in three victims of a porting scam suffers, on average, a financial loss of $11,368.\n\nMr Fletcher said he would look at further options to limit the success of phone-based scams in the coming months.\n\n\"We are also, through the scam-technology project, examining other issues including calls made to Australians purporting to be from the Australian Taxation Office or other well-known and trusted organisations,\" he said.\n\n\"What I say to Australians is if you have any doubt at all about who is calling you, put the phone down and then if you think it's the Australian Taxation Office, call back using one of their published numbers.\n\n\"That's an important step you can take to protect yourself.\"", "description": "About a million Australian phone customers will have extra protection against porting scams as the government moves to new industry-wide standards.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2411%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_24/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/78bf78afac612023c035db1d0a51de902701318c", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
