For the converted he described Welsh independence, not Brexit, as the way to take back control.\n\nFor those he wants to convert - especially voters in the Valleys seats which voted leave in 2016, and which Plaid must win to form a government in 2021 - there were big spending pledges on child care, jobs for young people, and a 50km rapid transit service \"allowing cross-valley travel for the first time in 50 years\".\n\nPlaid isn't the only party making big spending pledges for the years to come. The question of how they'd pay for any of it has been deferred to another day.\n\nThe AM for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr said a Plaid government could \"transform Wales from bottom of the pile to leader of the pack\", boosting digital and physical infrastructure.\n\nHe told conference the party would increase infrastructure investment by 2% of GDP by 2025.\n\nIt was time, he said, for a \"Crossrail for the valleys\" - a 50km rapid transit service from Treherbert to Pontypool.\n\n\"We'll take people out of their cars by giving them a real alternative,\" he said.\n\nMr Price said Wales needed a \"National Reconstruction programme\" - a \"\u00a320 billion Fund for Wales\" - paid for by Westminster.\n\nHe said Wales is owed reparations for \"a century of neglect that has left a country, rich in its resources, a bitter legacy of poverty, sickness, blighted lives and broken dreams\".\n\n\"Westminster owes us twenty times that for the wealth that they stole. Northern Ireland deserves a New Deal absolutely, but surely that's right for Wales too.\"\n\nTurning his line of attack to the Welsh Government, the former MP accused Labour of being the \"handmaidens of continuing Tory austerity here at home\".\n\n\"The cold, hard, truth is that the Brexit vote in 2016 wasn't merely or even mainly a rejection of Europe. Rather, it was a rejection of politics as business as usual, of a complacency of twenty years of drift and decline - an indictment of the promise of a better life that devolution offered but, under Labour, failed to deliver,\" he said.\n\nImage caption Liz Saville Roberts is Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader\n\nPlaid Cymru is hoping to build on its performance at May's European elections when the party came second in Wales behind the Brexit Party but ahead of Labour.\n\nIt was the first time Plaid had beaten Labour in a Wales-wide election.\n\nWestminster leader Liz Saville Roberts used her speech in Swansea to criticise Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\n\"This is the man who weaponises language, who brought the words of civil war to the chamber, only to be brought down by civil law and a girly swot in a spider brooch,\" she said, referring to the president of the Supreme Court, Lady Hale.\n\nMeanwhile South Wales West AM Dai Lloyd announced that he would not stand on the regional list in the next assembly election in 2021.\n\nHe will stand in the Swansea West constituency only.\n\nPlaid Cymru has four MPs, 10 assembly members and one MEP.", "description": "Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price says an independence referendum will take place in the next decade.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07q4q16.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
