She was dead within 72 hours.\n\nAttorneys representing Madison Cross\u2019s parents, Bobbie Ziemer and Kevin Cross, and her daughter, Kinsley Cross, say in a lawsuit that Serenity Care Center failed to order standard tests, diagnose an underlying medical condition and recognize her worsening symptoms, factors that could have prevented her death.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Oct. 1 in Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix, names as defendants Serenity Care Center, Aid in Recovery, Pinnacle Peak Recovery and Treatment Management Company, and two medical providers, Dr. Reyes Topete and physician assistant Paul Bratcher.\n\nA spokesman for Serenity and its affiliates declined to discuss the lawsuit. Bratcher did not return a message left at a clinic where he works. The defendants have not yet responded to the lawsuit in court.\n\nTopete, who supervised Bratcher, said the Arizona Medical Board investigated the case and \"found nothing wrong on my part.\" However, the board said in a Feb. 12 advisory letter Topete had \"inadequate oversight\" of providers and an \"inadequate delegation agreement with a physician assistant.\"\n\nHe was not disciplined nor was he fined; the board warned \"continuation of the activities that led to the investigation\" could prompt action. The state's physician assistants board dismissed a complaint against Bratcher.\n\nIn 2017, Americans entered inpatient, outpatient and residential treatment programs more than 2 million times, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The agency reported 3,788 deaths.\n\nCross's family said she agreed to seek treatment at Serenity because she wanted to recover from substance-use disorder to care for her then-2-year-old daughter Kinsley.\n\nMadison Cross, 22, of Ohio, died less than 3 days after entering a detox center. More\n\nSerenity or its affiliate companies arranged a flight from Columbus to Phoenix on Oct. 7, 2017, then ground transportation to the detox center located in nearby Sun City, according to the lawsuit.\n\nCross did not know she had pneumonia when she checked into the detox center, and Serenity did not properly screen or test her when she arrived at the center, the complaint contends.\n\nSerenity\u2019s standard admission orders require a doctor, physician\u2019s assistant or a registered nurse take a patient\u2019s medical history, perform a physical exam and take blood tests, according to the lawsuit. But the family asserts Cross was never screened by a doctor or a registered nurse, and the staff did not complete the blood tests, a complete blood count or a comprehensive metabolic panel, which might have detected her illness.\n\nJohn Wrona, an attorney representing the family, said the lack of testing represented a \u201cvery poor beginning, and it didn\u2019t get better.\u201d\n\nEven though staff did not complete the blood tests, there were other signs her condition was worsening, the lawsuit states: Cross was jaundiced; her face and lips were discolored; her pulse raced to 167; her pulse oxygenation rate dipped to 87%, below a normal range in the high 90s.\n\nInstead of sending her to the hospital on the morning she died, Serenity\u2019s staff gave her a beta blocker, propranolol, lowering her pulse rate without treating her underlying condition, \u201cin effect stopping the one thing that was keeping her alive,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nShe collapsed in her room and was left on the ground for at least six minutes before staff entered. Unresponsive, she was transported to a hospital less than one mile away where she was pronounced dead.\n\nThe Maricopa County Medical Examiner\u2019s autopsy determined her cause of death to be septic complications of acute bronchopneumonia, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit contends the toxicology report findings \u201clead to one conclusion: that any opioids in (Cross\u2019s) system had been consumed prior to her admission,\u201d to the detox center on Oct. 7.\n\nThe lawsuit said a Serenity spokesman falsely claimed in a media report Cross had consumed illicit drugs after she was admitted to Serenity.", "description": "An Ohio mom died within 72 hours of checking into an Arizona detox center.
