An autopsy found that the bullet hit Melanie Pettibone in the thigh and traveled to her uterus.\n\nPolice initially arrested Sheldon Pettibone for negligently discharging the gun, but on Wednesday he was charged with manslaughter. Pettibone appeared in court Thursday on the new charges. Bond was set at $50,000 cash only. Pettibone will be represented by a public defender, and the Minnehaha County public defender\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\nPolice say Pettibone admitted he was distracted by a football game on TV. He said it was possible the gun fired because of \u201coperator error.\u201d\n\nPettibone told police the gun fired when he released the slide and pulled it back a second time, and said it was \u201clikely\u201d the round was discharged from the gun in between the two movements. He told police his finger was \u201cnever within\u201d the trigger guard.\n\nUsing a search warrant, police found a loaded magazine in a boot behind the couch where Pettibone said he was going to sit and watch the game and clean his gun. Investigators also found a spent .40-caliber shell casing in the trash and an unloaded .40- caliber handgun with the slide locked back on the upper shelf of a bedroom closet. There were no rounds in the chamber and no magazine.\n\nMelanie Pettibone told police she was sitting on the couch watching the football game, and her husband was sitting on the opposite side of the sofa, sitting with pieces of the handgun in his lap.\n\nShe heard a \u201cloud noise\u201d and felt a \u201csharp pain\u201d in her leg, and she ran out of the apartment. She came back inside and told Pettibone she had been shot. Pettibone helped her to their van and went back inside the apartment. He returned after \u201ca short period of time,\u201d and applied a tourniquet to her leg before driving to the hospital.\n\nIn January, Sheldon Pettibone was arrested after authorities said he shot at people who he claimed had stole his phone. Police said he was charged with the reckless discharge of a firearm and discharging a weapon within city limits. Those charges were dismissed, and Pettibone pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was given a 30-day suspended jail sentence.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A South Dakota man has been charged with second-degree manslaughter after police say he negligently shot his pregnant wife, leading to the loss of their unborn child.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2018/08/02/sirens_c0-0-900-525_s1200x700.jpg?18fe2bf8ee3c941346c84a9d9287e8c0f15139e7", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
