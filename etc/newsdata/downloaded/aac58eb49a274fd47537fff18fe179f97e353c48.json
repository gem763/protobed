Many market observers never look beyond the headlines, which are often gross generalizations. Words such as \"bear\" and \"bull\" are used because they make it easy to characterize the market as negative or positive.\n\nQuite often stocks move in tandem and the character of the action can be summed up easily. However, there other times, such as now, when the action is far more complex and calling it \"bullish\" or \"bearish\" is not only incorrect, but also misleading.\n\nIt is obvious the indices have been acting quite poorly for a couple days now. The leading indices are down about 3% in two days. The market weakness is blamed on signs of economic weakness in the ISM Report and elsewhere.\n\nWhile the drop in the indices is painful, it isn't significant enough to cause too much concern among headline writers. The indices are still only a few percentage points off their recent highs and many leading stocks such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have suffered only relatively minor losses.\n\nThe thing the headlines don't tell us about the market is that it is already undergoing a severe rolling correction. Many individual stocks and sectors are already in a \"bear market\" if you use the definition of a 20% drop from recent highs. The action of the last couple days is significant because that corrective action finally rotated into stocks that move the indices. Most of the losses in the leading big-cap names are still minimal, but the risk it could accelerate is now higher.\n\nIf you think of the market as going through a rolling correction with various sectors experiencing bear markets at different times it gives the action a much different character than if you think of it as a single entity that is summed up by the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). This is a market already struggling with bear market action while much of the media is still arguing whether a bear market might eventually occur. It is like arguing over whether a hurricane is occurring while your house is being flooded.\n\nThinking of this as a rolling correction is particularly important because it means that some of the market has already corrected and may not have that much downside. At the same time, other stocks still have significant room to correct before they find support.\n\nWednesday's action was a good illustration of the rotational nature of the market. While the indices took significant hits, many of the stocks that have suffered the most in recent weeks held steady and performed slightly better. There weren't any big bounces, but the selling slowed and moved into other areas of the market.\n\nOne of the problems with rotational correction is that the indices help to establish overall market sentiment. It is tough for small stocks that already are beaten up when the business media are running headlines about market weakness. Why would someone rush to buy individual stocks that have found support when the headlines are screaming about bear markets?\n\nThe important issue here is to stay focused on individual stocks if you want to have a clear understanding of market health. This is a market already deep into a correction. The indices don't reflect that at all and it is going to change how this poor action eventually resolves itself.\n\nMy game plan remains a high level of cash and very selective stock picking. I like some of the opportunities I see developing in sectors that have already corrected but it is too early to put much capital at risk.\n\nWe have some minor weakness to start the day and not much reaction to the expected European Union tariffs.", "description": "This isn't a bear stock market, but rather a market that is going through a rolling correction with various sectors experiencing bear markets at different times, which gives the action a different character than if you think of the market as a single entity that is summed up by the S&amp;P 500....AAPL", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "This Isn'T A Bear Market", "But Rather A Rotational Correction", "Thinking Of The Market As Going Through A Rolling Correction With Various Sectors Experiencing Bear Markets At Different Times Gives The Action A Different Character Than If You Think Of It As A Single Entity.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "Bruce Kamich", "Jim Collins", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/84a22adb-d0e1-11e9-822b-059bc5a456fd.png"}
