Indeed, said fellow judge Carrie Ann Inaba, \"it was a dance only your mummies could love,\" a step down from his quick-step to \"You've Got a Friend\" from \"Toy Story\" two weeks earlier.\n\nSEAN SPICER PANNED FOR 'SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER' DISCO MOVES\n\nThe pointed critiques weren't the first for Spicer, who launched a tweetstorm of memes as press secretary and was satirized by the comedian Melissa McCarthy on \"Saturday Night Live\" before venturing into entertainment. He has had his share of Twitter hate, too.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nBut the 48-year-old's star turn has also garnered support from his former boss, President Trump.\n\nSpicer told the New York Post the President called him Sunday \u2014 just hours after the killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi \u2014 and complimented him on his recent weight loss.\n\nI spoke to the president on Sunday, he made it clear he\u2019s watching me. I doubt it\u2019s in real time, but he knew all about my costumes and he noticed my weight loss \u2014 he told me, \u2018Have you been slimming down?' - Sean Spicer/New York Post\n\nSpicer and Arnold captured 18 out of 30 possible points with \"Monster Mash,\" a performance that Spicer said required four hours in makeup to attain the green skin, jet black hair and lowering brow identified with Frankenstein's monster since Boris Karloff played the character in the 1930s.\n\nNETFLIX NEEDS TO RAISE BILLIONS; SHOULD INVESTORS WORRY?\n\nEarlier this season, Spicer attempted what may have been his toughest challenge on the show to date, emulating John Travolta's iconic performance as disco prince Tony Manero in 1977's \"Saturday Night Fever.\" Travolta was less than half Spicer's age when he filmed the movie, and he possessed an energy that Chicago Tribune movie critic Gene Siskel compared to a \"peacock on amphetamines.\"", "description": "The former White House press secretary earned 18 out of 30 possible points in the most recent episode of 'Dancing With the Stars.'", "authors": ["James Langford"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/sean-spicer-DWTS-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
