I haven\u2019t done it in a while and I\u2019ve missed it.\u201d\n\nWoods made his final gain at the ninth where he barked for his ball to \u201cget down\u201d out of the rough.\n\n\u201cThis grass, Zoysia, man. You can get some serious flyers out here, monster flyers,\u201d said Woods.\n\n\u201cThe one I hit on the last hole, we were trying to hit an eight-iron 200 yards and hit it 200. That\u2019s not something I normally do.\u201d\n\nThe Zozo Championship offers a $9.75 million prize pot as the middle leg of the Tour\u2019s new near $30 million three-tournament Asian swing.\n\nIt began last week at the $9.75 million CJ Cup in South Korea, won by Justin Thomas who shot a level par 70 on Thursday, and concludes at next week\u2019s $10.25 million WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai.\n\nUnder threat of a tropical storm moving through the area from late morning, Friday\u2019s second round will start an hour earlier at 7am (2200 GMT Thursday) with the last three balls teeing off at 9am.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Tiger Woods got off to a horrific start before roaring back with nine birdies in 15 holes to share the inaugural Zozo Championship lead in Japan Thursday as Rory McIlroy struggled.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/80740921d5e54dead0efef9d91737f2a0dee37f5.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
