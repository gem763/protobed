We think he can take a huge step this year.\"\n\nBut while there was plenty of attention following the trade, that died down quickly in a Toronto summer that was dominated by the negotiations between the Leafs and Marner \u2014 a restricted free agent at the time \u2014 on a new deal.\n\nThen after the star winger signed his big-money extension at the start of camp, news broke that Matthews is facing a charge of disorderly conduct and disruptive behaviour stemming from an alleged incident, which he failed to disclose to the team, in his hometown of Scottsdale, Ariz., back in May. None of the allegations have been proven in court.\n\nTo top it all off, there was the near-constant talk swirling around who the Leafs would name as their captain before John Tavares was finally unveiled before Wednesday's game.\n\nThen on the ice, Matthews scored two goals to steal the post-game headlines along with Tavares, and overshadow Barrie's two-point night in his blue-and-white debut.\n\n'He's a guy you'll notice more and more'\n\n\"He flies under the radar a little bit, just because of everything that's going on,\" Leafs defenceman Morgan Rielly said. \"He's going to be a big part of what we're doing.\"\n\nBarrie had a boatload of talent up front in Colorado with Nathan MacKinnon, Mikko Rantanen and Gabriel Landeskog. He means no disrespect, but a stable of forwards that includes Matthews, Marner and Tavares \u2014 just to name a few \u2014 presents even more avenues for him to contribute.\n\n\"It's a lot of fun to be able to jump in the play and having these guys looking for you,\" Barrie said. \"It's been a lot of fun so far and it's one game in.\"\n\nMuzzin, who battled Barrie in the Western Conference with the Los Angeles Kings, was partnered with his now-NHL teammate for Canada at the 2015 world championship and is eager to see what this season brings the complementary pair.\n\n\"I was excited,\" Muzzin, who is more likely to hang back and let Barrie push the pace offensively, said of his initial reaction to the trade. \"It was a nice addition for me and the team.\"\n\nBut Leafs goalie Frederik Andersen might have put it best in terms of where Barrie currently stands and where he could soon find himself \u2014 in the spotlight.\n\n\"He's a guy you'll notice more and more.\"", "description": "In most cities and on most teams, acquiring a dynamic offensive defenceman in a blockbuster trade would dominate training camp chatter and make waves on opening night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5308243.1570140202!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/tyson-barrie.jpg"}
