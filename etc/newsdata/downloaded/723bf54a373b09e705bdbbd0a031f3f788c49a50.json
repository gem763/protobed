They may have secured five points and recovered from 10 points down, but overall this was a setback for them.\n\nWales, who face Uruguay in their final pool game on Sunday, had had a 10-day break, spending the first part of it in a resort on a freshwater lake. They started here, on a night when humidity was not a factor, as if they were still enjoying happy hour, 10 points down after nine minutes and well off a game that had been so synchronised in the opening two rounds.\n\nBrave Blossoms challenging old ideas of what it means to be Japanese Read more\n\nThree early kicks from Gareth Davies were well out of range of the chasers, offering Fiji space in which to counterattack, their rush defence, normally a key component, saw players operating at different speed, forming a zig-zag rather than a straight line, and Fiji worked room to attack Josh Adams on Wales\u2019s left wing.\n\nTheir first try on three minutes and their second after nine saw Adams first rush out of defence too quickly and leave himself exposed and then get his body position wrong in the tackle, easily bounced off. His opposite number Joshua Tuisova opened the scoring after a simple move saw the ball quickly moved right after Fiji had opted for a scrum rather than a kick at goal.\n\nThe second was created by Semi Radradra coming into the midfield from his wing and taking a deep-lying position. He forced the rushing defenders to stop and with two free runners wide out on the right, Kini Murimurivalu was able to use Tuisova as a decoy and thunder through Adams.\n\nWales were stunned. It was the first time they had been behind in the tournament and when Jonathan Davies threw a pass into touch rather than into the hands of Adams, the massed ranks of their supporters, so loud at the start, went quiet, as if remembering what Fiji did to Wales in the 2007 World Cup.\n\nWales at this stage had 14 men after Ken Owens was sent to the sin-bin for tipping the No 8 Viliame Mata in a tackle. The Fijian forward landed on his back, rather than his head or shoulders, which saved the hooker who had made the mistake of standing up before completing the challenge and suddenly Wales faced a test of character.\n\nThey were assisted by Fiji\u2019s second-row Tevita Cavubati who recklessly charged into a ruck from the side and led with his shoulder as he tried to clear out Ross Moriarty. He was sent to the sin-bin and two minutes later Dan Biggar, spotting Tuisova was at the bottom of a ruck on his opposite wing, kicked to the corner where Adams outwitted Ben Volavola.\n\nAdams was twice denied by the scrum-half Frank Lomani as Wales saw the scrum as the way to subdue Fiji but the wing scored his second after 30 minutes when Wales set up to drive a scrum but moved the ball after the flanker Semi Kunatani had become the third player to see yellow, this time for persistent infringing.\n\nWales, though, had not wished their problems away. Fiji had started flamboyantly, Leone Nakarawa\u2019s pass out of the back of his hand over the head of Hadleigh Parkes was a sign of what was to come. They ended the opening half on the attack, denied their third try by a forward pass, and within 12 minutes of the restart were back in the lead.\n\nWales\u2019s flanker James Davies was walking to the sin-bin, shaking his head at the verdict of the referee J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garc\u00e8s, who was taking charge of his 50th international, that he had slowed down the ball. Fiji kicked to touch and were awarded a penalty try when Wales collapsed the resulting driving maul.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\n\n\nIt got worse for Wales. Biggar, who was concussed in the previous match against Australia, collided with Liam Williams as both went to catch the ball. The back of the outside-half\u2019s head hit the ground and he received a knee in the mouth as his teammate landed.\n\nHe walked off after lengthy treatment, but after a second concussion he is unlikely to be available for the quarter-final. Wales were looking ragged and when their captain Alun Wyn Jones dropped a pass in midfield, there was a time in the past when heads would have not so much dropped as become detached from shoulders.\n\nRhys Patchell kicked a penalty to level the scores and then, just when Wales needed a moment of class, Jonathan Davies fended off Jake Vatubua on a run into Fiji\u2019s 22 and drew the cover defence before passing out of the back of his hand to Adams who somehow touched down for his hat-trick just before being tackled into touch.\n\nFiji finally faded, Liam Williams scoring the bonus point try after being set up by Ross Moriarty and Gareth Davies, but in victory came injury concerns with both Adams and Jonathan Davies suffering knee injuries and Liam Williams checking various parts of his body after three thumping tackles.", "description": "Wales battled back from 10-0 down to claim a bonus-point win over Fiji, though injuries could be a concern for Warren Gatland", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83401336e2f7298b417153b67f255d206123f400/0_133_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cab7b602d7ab1f9e156aad8f7cc209de", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
