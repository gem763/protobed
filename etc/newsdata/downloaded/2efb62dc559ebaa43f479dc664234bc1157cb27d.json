Does Smith even chillax?\n\n\u201cWe play a lot of Banangrams, which is a wonderful game. It\u2019s like Scrabble but much quicker. It keeps your mind very sharp,\u201d Wilton told us. \u201cYou can\u2019t go sit and read a book when you\u2019re filming a scene. We chat a lot, but Bananagrams keeps us alive, especially in those scenes around the dinner table, since they take ages to film. It gets very boring. It kept us alive!\u201d And, dare we ask, who\u2019s the better player? \u201cI\u2019m afraid to say, Maggie\u2019s brilliant at Bananagrams,\u201d Wilton added. \u201cLike in the film, she wins all the time.\u201d To think \u2014 all that on-set anachronistic game play, and it never accidentally made its way into the show! Well, to our knowledge, anyway.", "description": "At the NYC premiere of the Downton Abbey film, Penelope Wilton told Vulture how she and Maggie Smith would play Bananagrams to pass time.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/17/17-maggie-smith-penelope-wilton.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
