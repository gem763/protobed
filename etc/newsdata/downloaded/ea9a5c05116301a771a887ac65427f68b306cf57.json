O\u2019Donnell, particularly, noted that Biden had not only lost his polling advantage but had also fallen behind competitors like Sens. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in fundraising.\n\n\u201cI just flat beat them,\u201d Biden responded with a laugh before adding that his campaign was \u201con a course to do extremely well.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m not worried about being able to fund this campaign. I really am not, truly.\u201d\n\nDespite the former vice president\u2019s bravado, his campaign has expressed increasing concern over its fundraising capabilities in the past few weeks.\n\n\u201cI hate to say it, but our opponents are way ahead of us when it comes to money in the bank,\u201d Elana Firsht, a campaign aide, admitted in a recent fundraising email. \u201cIf we don\u2019t pick up the pace here, we might have to make budget cuts that could seriously hurt our momentum in this primary.\u201d\n\nAlthough Biden started the race with a strong funding advantage, thanks to support from high-dollar donors, he ended the most recent fundraising period well behind his competitors. In between July and the end of September, Biden only raised $15.2 million. The sum was dwarfed by that raised by Sanders ($25.3 million), Warren ($24.6 million), and Mayor Pete Buttigieg ($19.1 million).\n\nCompounding the problem is that the former vice president\u2019s campaign has spent on luxury travel, depleting his total cash on hand to just $9 million at the end of the third quarter. His rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand.\n\nBiden fundraising troubles stem from inability to make in-roads with small-dollar donors. Unlike Warren or Sanders, more than 2,800 donors have already maxed out to Biden\u2019s campaign since his announcement, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In fact, top-dollar donors make up a far higher percentage of Biden\u2019s campaign\u2019s coffers than those of his competitors.\n\nIn comparison, only 38 percent of the campaign\u2019s funds to date have come from individuals donating less than $200. Such a ratio poses an issue for the former vice president, especially now that his top contributors are prohibited by law from donating again until after he has secured the nomination.\n\nBiden\u2019s cash crunch was seen as the primary motivator for his campaign\u2019s decision to jettison its stance of discouraging super PACs, which are allowed to raise and spend unlimited funds, on Thursday. The move came even after Biden had made a show this year of pledging to pass stronger restrictions on super PACs and dark money groups if elected president.\n\n\u201cOur Constitution doesn\u2019t begin with the phrase, \u2018We the Democrats\u2019 or \u2018We the Republicans,'\u201d Biden said at a campaign event in May. \u201cAnd it certainly doesn\u2019t begin with the phrase, \u201cWe the Donors.\u201d", "description": "Joe Biden scoffed at his fundraising troubles, claiming he was on course to do \"extremely well\" \u2014 an opinion not shared by his own aides.", "authors": ["Haris Alic"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/joe-biden-point-halo-102319-ap-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
