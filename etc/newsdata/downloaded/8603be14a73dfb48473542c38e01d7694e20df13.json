BHP will spend $US144 million on the engineering work needed to support project planning and on finalising the export pathway out of Canada. BHP says an additional $US201 million is needed to \u201cfurther derisk the project\u201d through a slate of engineering and procurement projects and completion of preparation for the construction of the underground infrastructure that will be installed should FID be earned in February \u201921.\n\nBHP has long coveted a place in the potash mainstream. The opportunity was seeded by former chief executive Chip Goodyear and very actively embraced by Mackenzie when he ran BHP\u2019s non-ferrous silo ahead of becoming CEO.\n\nNonetheless, Jansen remains a polarising project.\n\nBefore resetting expectations in May, Mackenzie admitted BHP was over-invested in the project.\n\n\u201cAs our thinking around the project\u2019s initial scope has evolved, I acknowledge we over-invested to date,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, Jansen remains an attractive option for BHP given its strategic fit, risk-return metrics and the longer term optionality the initial investment would create.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLampooned by competitors\n\nBHP\u2019s investment thesis is straightforward. Wealth changes diets. The global economy has an ever expanding middle class bulge and that means demand patterns for food will change. To satisfy that demand shift will require, among other things, a more efficient community of farmers and pastoralists. And potash is a great way of fuelling that efficiency.\n\nBut BHP has been consistently lampooned by its possible competitors in Canada and the US and criticised by some investors and sectoral analysts who assess the long-term rewards of a life in potash do not justify the up-front capital risk.\n\nOne of the owners that has publicly disused the whole idea is Elliott Associates, the US activist investor that has consistently claimed overweight credit for the portfolio reshaping Mackenzie has driven.\n\nSo the timing of this latest indication of intent could be interesting. Certainly Paul Singer\u2019s people have been quiet on the BHP front of late. But, in recent days, we have been contacted by two New York-based event hedge funds wanting to chat about the likely gateways for progress on Elliott\u2019s final BHP frontier, the collapse of its dual-listed structure.\n\nCoincidence is a fine thing and it has been repeated at BHP with its people too in receipt of in-bound calls from US hedge funds interested in progress on the DLC.\n\nThose calls would have been short. Outside of plans to exit thermal coal, which is one of the gateways to the end of the DLC years, there is no live plan to deliver on Elliott\u2019s recommendation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack in the real world of value creating, the September quarterly appeared to pave the way for the early progress on the Trion oil discovery that BHP acquired for a $US620 million work commitment back in 2016.\n\nBHP has drilled three appraisal wells on Trion and each has delivered slightly more positively than expected. On Thursday, BHP said \u201cno further appraisal wells are anticipated\u201d. And that would appear to indicate that BHP and partner PEMEX are ready to design a staged development, which could see the early move that Mackenzie has previously indicated is his preference.\n\nWorld class copper\n\nThis is good news. But, for mine, it is not the best news carried in the September quarterly. That arrived in the coded form of drilling results from a South Australian copper discovery whose potential BHP first revealed as recently as last November.\n\nThe discovery is called Oak Dam and it lives just 65 kilometres to the south-east of BHP's underperforming copper factory in the desert, Olympic Dam.\n\nThe first indication that Oak Dam is a prospect of rare substance was that the results from the four drill holes that revealed the presence of copper, silver, uranium and gold were material enough to warrant disclosure on the ASX platform.\n\nCertainly, those initial results were compelling. According to the independent advice we received, the best of the initial Oak Dam drill holes topped anything discovered globally in 2018 and it ranked fifth on the list of best copper hits over the past decade.\n\nTo refresh, that hole \u2013 called AD-23 \u2013 revealed 425.7 metres of 3.04 per cent copper, 6.03 grams a tonne of gold, 346 parts per million of uranium and 0.59 grams per tonne of silver. That result included a 180m stretch that carried 6.07 per cent copper, 12.77g/t of gold, 401ppm of uranium and 0.92g/t of silver.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other three initial strike holes carried significant stretches of copper of grades, ranging from 0.52 per cent to 2.11 per cent.\n\nAs promised in November, BHP has attacked the task of definition of Oak Dam with some vigour and the results released on Thursday would appear to justify that enthusiasm.\n\nThe best return is from a hole whose path, at a point, appears to intersect with the path of AD-23. That new hole \u2013 called AD-26 \u2013 revealed 205m of 2.05 per cent copper with 3.8g/t of gold, with a sweet spot of 44m of 5.77 per cent copper with a splendid 14g/t of gold, 1.2g/t of silver and 643ppm of uranium.\n\nThe best of both those top quality drill holes sits at depths of below 800m but AD-26 appears to reveal potential beneath the big strike zone.\n\nIn his introductory commentary, Mackenzie described the results reported in the quarterly as \u201cencouraging\u201d and the company subsequently reported that Oak Dam was a project \u201cat an early stage with large parts of the target still to be tested\u201d. It also reported that the next phase of drilling would get under way in November.\n\nRecently we told Mackenzie that an assessment of Oak Dam delivered to me by a geologist of considerable renown was that the discovery would be commercial, though we would need to wait to see whether it was big enough for BHP to bother with.\n\nMackenzie didn\u2019t quite see it that way. The way he sees it, if future drilling proved it a commercial resource then BHP would be the natural developer both because Olympic Dam is so close by and because drilling had revealed the mineralisation was rich in uranium.\n\nOak Dam is one to watch.", "description": "Having shrunk to greatness, BHP is now drilling its way to growth as it sets the date for potash D-Day.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b234b0fa8015e47a375aeb7eab4a4b2471053a17", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
