She and her late husband, former GAF Corporation Chairman Samuel Heyman, designed and built the home for their family in 2007, after purchasing and tearing down the house that was previously on the parcel, according to Sotheby\u2019s. This house sits on the same foundation as the previous one.\n\nMore: Single-Family Home Prices in Greenwich, Connecticut, Rise, While Sales Fall\n\nThe Heymans are well known in the art world both as both donors and collectors, with works by Rothko, Pollock and others in their own private collection.\n\nThe brick-and-stone-sided house looks \"timeless,\" Mr. Gibbons said. \"You walk into one of the bathrooms and it feels like it was designed yesterday,\" not 12 years ago.\n\n\"True quality is really timeless,\" he said, pointing out the \"quality of the materials, the grandeur and the taste level\" throughout the seven-bedroom home.\n\nThe house was designed by New York-based Ferguson & Shamamian Architects, and the builder was Paul Tallman of Tallman Building Company, according to Sotheby\u2019s.\n\nDesign features include 12-foot ceilings, large public rooms, several sets of French doors that open to terraces and grounds, hardwood floors throughout, built-in window seats and bookcases, and graceful arched doorways.\n\nMore: How Much Will the Mansion Tax in Connecticut Increase Fees on Sales?\n\n\"The house really has two master suites, both of which have their own seaside terraces,\" Mr. Gibbons said.\n\nThe eat-in kitchen, which abuts the family room, has a \"coffered ceiling, custom cabinetry, a gray limestone floor and state-of-the-art appliances,\" he said.\n\nThe house was designed to maximize the water views, Mr. Gibbons said. \"The living room, family room and dining room are all along the water.\"\n\nThe rooms that don\u2019t have views of Long Island Sound have views of the \"beautiful gardens and landscaping,\" he said.\n\nThe house is quite close to the water, so you get even better views than you would today with current zoning laws, he explained. \"You have 180-degree views because of the way the property sits out\" on the waterfront beyond its neighbors.\n\nThe topography of Beachside Avenue \"jumps up high really quickly,\" Mr. Gibbons said, so flooding is not an issue for its residents.\n\nFrom Penta: Banksy\u2019s Largest Work Heads to Auction\n\nStats\n\nThe 11,458-square-foot house has seven bedrooms, seven full bathrooms and three partial bathrooms. It sits on a 2.14-acre lot.\n\nAmenities\n\nOne of the property\u2019s best amenities is a seaside terrace that\u2019s built right into the seawall, Mr. Gibbons said. \"You can have cocktail parties right on top of Long Island Sound, with water lapping up against the terrace.\"\n\nThere is also an 18-seat movie theater and a home gym.\n\nMore: A Century-Old Waterfront Estate in Connecticut With an Easy Commute to New York City\n\nNeighborhood Notes\n\nIt\u2019s a five- to 10-minute drive to downtown Westport, Mr. Gibbons said. \"Shops, restaurants and the train are all minutes away.\"\n\nBy express train, it\u2019s about a 70-minute ride from Westport to Manhattan\u2019s Grand Central Terminal.\n\nAgent: Todd Gibbons, William Pitt/Julia B Fee Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\n\nView the original listing.
