Once again, Ecuador's indigenous sector has proven its strength and now will be emboldened to look for concessions from the government in other areas,\" said Eileen Gavin, senior Latin America analyst at Verisk Maplecroft.\n\n\"This inevitably means a slower fiscal adjustment between now and the 2021 election,\" Gavin added in an email.\n\nNonetheless, Moreno's actions brought a much-needed measure of calm to the streets of the capital Quito, where residents began to restore order and clear away the makeshift blockades that sprang up in recent days.\n\nEcuadorean indigenous leader Jaime Vargas said on Monday that gasoline and diesel prices and transportation fares must return to levels that were in effect before the government's now-canceled plan to slash fuel subsidies.\n\n\"We have freed the country,\" Vargas said to cheers from supporters at a press conference. \"Enough of the pillaging of the Ecuadorean people.\"\n\nThe protests grew increasingly chaotic in recent days after the government launched a crackdown against extremists who it said had infiltrated protests. Authorities reported that the office of the comptroller, a local TV station and military vehicles were set on fire.\n\nIndigenous protesters who streamed into Quito from Andean and Amazonian provinces to join the protests piled into buses that departed the city on Monday.\n\n\"We're going back to our territories,\" said Inti Killa, an indigenous man from the Amazonian region of Napo. \"We've shown that unity and conviction of the people is a volcano that nobody can stop.\"\n\nOIL SECTOR\n\nThe city technically remained under a daytime curfew on Monday. But residents largely ignored it and headed to work.\n\nOne of the government's more immediate priorities will be to re-establish oil sector operations, which were suspended in some regions after protesters broke into plants.\n\n\"We need to re-establish oil production,\" said Energy Minister Carlos Perez. He added that Ecuador stopped producing some 2 million barrels of oil during the protests, costing the government more than $100 million in lost income.\n\n\"I expect things to be back to normal in about 15 days,\" Perez said.
