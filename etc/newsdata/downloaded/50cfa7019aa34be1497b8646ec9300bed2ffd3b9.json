BA, -1.31% plane into the Java Sea, echoing a preliminary report from Indonesia last year.\n\nMisfires of an automated flight-control feature called MCAS on the MAX fleet led to the nosedive of the Lion Air jet and a similar crash of an Ethiopian Airlines MAX shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa in March. The two crashes took 346 lives, prompted the grounding of all 737 MAX planes and disrupted the global aviation industry.\n\nDetails of the Indonesian report, which haven\u2019t been reported previously, are subject to change and further analysis. Indonesian investigators declined to comment, except to say the final document is likely come out in early November.\n\nA Boeing spokesman said the plane maker continues to work with Indonesian authorities as they complete the report.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\n\nPopular on WSJ.com:\n\nYemeni rebels warn Iran plans another strike soon\n\nAt 10,000 and counting, this company is flooding the U.S. with tariff appeals", "description": "Indonesian investigators have determined that design and oversight lapses played a central role in the fatal crash of a Boeing 737 MAX jet in October,...", "authors": ["Andy Pasztor", "Andrew Tangel"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HH488_boeing_ZG_20190411215528.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
