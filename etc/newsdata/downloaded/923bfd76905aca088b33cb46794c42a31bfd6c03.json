I have been a member for 55 years and a public representative in local and central government continuously since 1970. My decision has been truly agonising, as it has been for the thousands of other party members who have already left. \u2018I will not join any other party. I hope that under different leadership I will be able to return to my political home. I would like to thank the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs who have fought Labour\u2019s antisemitism valiantly and the Co-operative Party who have taken a firm and unequivocal stance against this racism. I would also like to applaud the integrity of those local members who have continued to speak out. \u2018I believe that Jeremy Corbyn is not fit to serve as our Prime Minister. With a looming general election and the possibility of him becoming Prime Minister, I feel I have to take a stand. I cannot advocate a government led by Jeremy Corbyn. \u2018Under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, antisemitism has become mainstream in the Labour Party. Jewish members have been bullied, abused and driven out. Antisemites have felt comfortable and vile conspiracy theories have been propagated. A party that permits anti-Jewish racism to flourish cannot be called anti-racist. \u2018This is not compatible with the Labour Party\u2019s values of equality, tolerance and respect for minorities. Shamefully, its anti-Jewish racism is now being investigated by one of the last labour government\u2019s proudest creations, the Equality and Human Rights Commission. \u2018Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 who spent three decades on the backbenches consorting with, and never confronting, antisemites, Holocaust deniers and terrorists \u2013 has attracted the support of too many antisemites. \u2018The Labour Party is no longer a safe place for Jews and Jeremy Corbyn must bear the responsibility for this. We cannot allow him to do to the country what he has done to the Labour Party. \u2018The overwhelming majority of the Jewish community is fearful of what a Corbyn government might mean for Britain\u2019s Jews. I share those concerns. But this issue is not simply about the Jewish community. This is about the nature of our society. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s seeming tolerance of antisemitism would embolden racists, poison our public debate and damage the social cohesion of our country. \u2018My values \u2013 traditional Labour values \u2013 have remained the same. It is Labour, under Jeremy Corbyn, that has changed. He has presided over a culture of hatred, fear and intolerance in the Labour Party. \u2018But this issue is no longer just about the Labour Party \u2013 it is about the threat a Jeremy Corbyn premiership could pose to the country.\u2019", "description": "A veteran Labour MP has quit the party, accusing leader Jeremy Corbyn of being a danger to Britain.
