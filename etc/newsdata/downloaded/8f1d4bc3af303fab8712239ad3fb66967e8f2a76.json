Politicians from Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) to Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) called for the company to curtail its crypto venture. Some elected officials have gone so far as to compare the potential damage of Libra to the subprime mortgage crisis and to 9/11.\n\nWhen Facebook announced Libra, it also announced 28 \u201cfounding members\u201d in the Libra Association, the governance group set to be headquartered in Geneva. (The New York Times reported in late June that none of the companies identified as founding members had actually signed binding agreements.) Through more than three months of scrutiny, those partners hung around\u2014until this month.\n\nPayPal exited the Libra Association last week; on Friday eBay, Stripe, and MasterCard followed suit, in a major blow to Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency plans.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate their support for the goals and mission of the Libra project,\u201d said Dante Disparte, head of Policy and Communications for the Libra Association. \u201cWe are focused on moving forward and continuing to build a strong association of some of the world\u2019s leading enterprises, social impact organizations and other stakeholders to achieve a safe, transparent, and consumer-friendly implementation of a global payment system that breaks down financial barriers for billions of people. Although the makeup of the Association members may grow and change over time, the design principle of Libra\u2019s governance and technology, along with the open nature of this project ensures the Libra payment network will remain resilient. We look forward to the inaugural Libra Association Council meeting in just 3 days and announcing the initial members of the Libra Association.\u201d\n\nThe inciting event on Friday could have been a letter this week that Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI) sent to Visa, MasterCard, and Stripe warning them about the risks of Libra.\n\nAmid the Friday afternoon exodus, Sen. Brown\u2019s office sent out this statement to media: \u201cLarge payment companies are wise to avoid legitimizing Facebook\u2019s private, global currency. Facebook is too big and too powerful, and it is unconscionable for financial companies to aid it in monopolizing our economic infrastructure. I trust others will see the wisdom of avoiding this ill-conceived undertaking.\u201d\n\nFacebook declined to comment on the exits.\n\nStanding by Libra\n\nTo be sure, some in the industry are bullish on Libra even without its big-name backers. Kristin Smith of the Blockchain Association, a trade group that represents crypto and blockchain companies (but not Libra) told Yahoo Finance after PayPal dropped that the reaction to PayPal\u2019s exit was \u201coverrated\u201d and that \u201cat this point the adoption of crypto on a mass scale is inevitable, whether it be through Libra itself or some of these other companies out there, and lawmakers know it.\u201d\n\nAnd some of the founding members have responded to a Yahoo Finance inquiry confirming that they are still on board with the Libra Association.\n\nKiva, a non-profit micro-lending platform, confirms it is still a member.\n\nAnchorage, a cold-storage crypto company, is still in the Libra Association. Anchorage co-founder and president Diogo Monica tells Yahoo Finance, \u201cAnchorage is dedicated to continuing the mission of the Libra Association, and is proud to be a founding member, having worked on the project from the start.\u201d\n\nMercyCorps, a humanitarian aid charity, is still in, and tells Yahoo Finance, \u201cWe are maintaining our relationship with the association and we remain committed to ensuring that the voice of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people are heard in the formation of this initiative, and that digital financial services include them and their needs.\u201d\n\nCutting ties with Libra\n\nYahoo Finance will track all the dropouts here and continue to update this post when more companies exit.\n\nThis post was last updated on Oct. 11 at 5:35pm EST.", "description": "PayPal, eBay, Stripe, MasterCard and Visa have dropped from the Libra Association, in a blow to Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency plans.", "authors": ["Daniel Roberts", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yZq3v6P2SmVp9o22jdUw0w--~B/aD0yODg1O3c9NDQyOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/6d539630-ec64-11e9-bdbb-db6b27468670", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
