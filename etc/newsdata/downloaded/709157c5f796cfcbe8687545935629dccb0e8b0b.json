When Bill Callahan was asked about the possibility of starting Dwayne Haskins, the Redskins interim coach said the rookie still had a \u201cways to go\u201d \u2014 a phrase coach Jay Gruden uttered more than once over the last few months before his firing Monday.\n\nFor those wanting to see Haskins take over as the starter at quarterback, that won\u2019t happen just yet.\n\nBut in his first press conference, Callahan laid out his approach to developing Haskins \u2014 telling reporters the 22-year-old will get first-team reps in practice over the rest of the regular season.\n\n\u201cIt might be a little bit of a shift in philosophy as we move forward,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cSo he will be able to take repetitions at some point, whether it\u2019s at the beginning, the end, the middle, but we\u2019re really cognizant of trying to rep him up during the course of the practice so that he is prepared and that he does obviously get exposure to game-type repetitions that can get him potentially to a starting position here in the future or next year, whatever it may be.\u201d\n\nUnder Gruden, Haskins did not receive first-team reps in practice once the regular season started until Case Keenum hurt his foot in a Week 3 loss to the Chicago Bears. Even then, Keenum missed only two days of practice across two weeks and Colt McCoy took the lion\u2019s share of reps in lead up to Sunday\u2019s loss against the New England Patriots.\n\nWith the absence of first-team reps, most of Haskins\u2019 snaps had been from running with the scout team \u2014 a common occurrence around the NFL for a backup quarterback.\n\nThe Redskins, too, were trying to get Keenum up to speed given this was his first year in Gruden\u2019s system.\n\nStill, Gruden was criticized for his handling of Haskins. Critics argued Haskins wasn\u2019t getting enough work in practice, while others also blasted him for playing the rookie a Week 4 loss to the New York Giants. ESPN analyst Louis Riddick said the 22-year-old was being \u201cset up for failure.\u201d\n\nThe narratives fed into a general perception that Gruden was against taking Haskins in the draft.\n\nPrior to the draft, there were reports owner Dan Snyder and team president Bruce Allen were the ones obsessed with the Ohio State product, while Gruden and the coaching staff felt like they needed a player who could contribute right away. Haskins\u2019 reputation coming out of the draft was that he needed time to develop \u2014 he\u2019d started just one season with the Buckeyes.\n\n\u201cAll the coaches are involved in our draft meetings,\u201d Allen said Monday. \u201cWhen we\u2019re setting the draft board, the coaches are involved and they sign off on everything. \u2026 Jay was excited about Dwayne Haskins and I think he probably talked to several of you from OTAs and training camp about how well he was doing.\u201d\n\nGruden\u2019s firing was seen by some as an opportunity to free up playing time for Haskins. The Redskins are 0-5 and with the playoffs a long-shot, fans and some experts think Washington should use the rest of the season to get a better sense of Haskins\u2019 potential.\n\nBut that decision is up to Callahan, Allen said. And so far, the 63-year-old coach says he needs to see more.\n\nCallahan said the Redskins must get Haskins\u2019 \u201cconfidence level up\u201d and make him comfortable by finding a package of plays that he can go out and execute.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the focus right now,\u201d Callahan said.\n\nThat leaves the Redskins with the choice of starting Keenum or McCoy for Sunday\u2019s game in Miami. Callahan, who did not announce his starter, even floated the possibility of leaving Haskins inactive on game days, which has not happened this season.\n\nCallahan, though, still wants Haskins to be prepared because \u201canything can happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI take it upon myself to be cognizant of where he needs to go and where he needs to be,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cHis development is very, very important and there\u2019s a good plan in place, futuristically, for that to happen.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
