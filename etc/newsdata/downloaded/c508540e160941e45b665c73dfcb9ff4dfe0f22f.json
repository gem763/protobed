And at the end of last week, Amy feared that she would lose her mum for good.\n\nWhile it\u2019s pretty difficult for Amy to take the moral high ground in a situation that was triggered by theft and accidental death followed by a web of lies, her fear for Kerry leads her to lash out and warn Tracy that she could go to the police over this.\n\nOf course, Tracy has plenty of ammunition herself to hit back with \u2013 so it\u2019s not looking like a particularly pleasant outcome for anyone. With the three women having all accidentally caused serious injury \u2013 and in some cases worse \u2013 they clearly have the worst possible luck. And if Kerry dies, it can only get even more bleak.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Amy and Tracy have a stand off, it will eventually trigger Vanessa to remind Amy about how all of this has come about. Aghast at Amy\u2019s audacity to make threats after what she and Kerry did, Vanessa will lash out at her \u2013 and accidentally hit a nurse in the process? See what we mean about that terrible luck?\n\nAs Vanessa ends up in a cell, she might not be the only one in coming weeks if anyone follows through on their threats.\n\nSpeaking about the drama recently, Natalie Ann told Metro.co.uk: \u2018I\u2019ll be really interested to see the audience reaction to this and how it changes things \u2013 I think it will be really mixed, to be honest. Here we have another situation where someone has acted and not meant to hurt anyone but now it\u2019s gone too far. And it leaves both Amy and Tracy in big dilemmas and a lot to think about in terms of where they go from here.\n\n\u2018Kerry is really badly hurt and it\u2019s touch and so obviously now, there\u2019s not just the secret about the fire in the mix. Everyone here has made serious mistakes, and everyone could end up paying for them in some way. It\u2019ll be good to see how the audience takes to it because it could go a number of ways from here.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Amy means business as she fears the loss of her mum.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/amy-in-emmerdale-efe1_1570443770.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
