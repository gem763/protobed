And, unlike Hillary Clinton, I don\u2019t think I ever deleted any of those. \" \u2014 Rachael Bade (@rachaelmbade) September 17, 2019\n\n\"I also received hundreds of thousands of emails, some days with as many as a thousand emails,\" Lewandowski said. \"And unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't think I ever deleted any of those.\"\n\nClinton, the former secretary of state, never escaped her email scandal during the 2016 presidential election, especially after FBI director James Comey reopened the agency's investigation into her mishandling of intel 11 days before the vote. There were just too many questions about her use of a private server, and the mysterious disappearance of thousands of emails.\n\nTrump eagerly shared Lewandowski's remarks.\n\nAt today's Judiciary hearing, Nadler repeatedly asked Lewandowski to describe his relationship with President Trump. But the witness refused, noting that the White House had directed him not to share the substance of his conversations with the president.\n\nRepublicans on the panel couldn't blame Lewandowski for being uncooperative.\n\n\"We're wasting valuable committee time\" on this fake impeachment, Rep. Steve Chabot (R-OH) declared during his Q&A time. If they really want a headline, he suggested they interview Inspector General Michael Horowitz about the bias demonstrated against Trump at the beginning of this investigation.\n\nIf they really wanted to pursue a more worthwhile agenda, Chabot suggested they could instead focus on things like the opioid crisis.", "description": ".09/17/2019 19:20:50PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/260/f08c5472-ec83-4c03-a70d-398737f12598.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
