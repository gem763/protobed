Frans Steyn put a grubber through that got them stuck back into their 22.\n\n\n\n\"Francois Louw gave a penalty away when he just came on to the field, and I thought, 'Hell, OK, maybe that was the wrong call that I put him on'. Then two minutes later, he got the vital turnover inside our 22. Sometimes things work out for you, and sometimes they don't.\n\n\"A guy like S'bu (Nkosi) got a chance today. There were times in the game where he got found out, but there were certainly times when we had wonderful opportunities, and he played really well.\n\n\"That specific turnover by Flo (Louw) was very important for us to go through to the final.\"\n\nSaturday's final will also be played in Yokohama and kick-off is at 11:00 (SA time).", "description": "Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus has hailed the impact of substitute Francois Louw in his side's World Cup semi-final win over Wales.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7979/6cad584330354f028df8788f17e60061.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
