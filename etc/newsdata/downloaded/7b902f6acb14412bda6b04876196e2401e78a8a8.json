In turn, he released nearly 3,000 decryption keys for other victims, along with free decryption software.\n\nGerman programmer Tobias Fr\u00f6mel was forced to pay 0.09 BTC (USD 700) after attackers hacked into one of his publicly exposed QNAP Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices and encrypted its files. The ransomware has been named Muhstik due to .muhstik extension affixed on the stolen encrypted data and has been claiming victims for the past few weeks.\n\nThe ransomware attacks have been a popular way for many hackers to make money, particularly cryptocurrencies. The Muhstik ransomware found success by breaching into users devices with weak passwords by brute-forcing them.\n\nHowever, what the hackers didn\u2019t expect was that Fr\u00f6mel is going to hack their command and control server, and retrieve decryption keys of 2,858 Muhstik victims, reported BleepinComputer. As of now, the keys are available publicly for free together with Fr\u00f6mel\u2019s decryption software. Besides, software company Emsisoft has made a Muhstik decryptor for Windows users who fell victim to the ransomware.\n\nFr\u00f6mel's original post at BleepingComputer forum.

Looking at his provided wallet address, it can be seen that so far, despite the good deed, he only got 0.0114 BTC back, which is still far off the 0.09 BTC that he paid for the hackers.\n\ngrabbed the decryption keys from his server and put these public, you can now decrypt for free: https://t.co/8ZlISJz9hB \u2014 Bot (@battleck) October 7, 2019\n\nLearn more: How Crypto YouTuber Scammed a Scammer and Donated the Money to Charity", "description": "A victim of a Muhstik Ransomware attack paid in bitcoin (BTC) to unlock his files just to strike back and hack his hackers.
