That\u2019s what brings us together,\u201d Frazier said in a conversation with Yahoo Finance\u2019s Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit. \u201cWe come from different countries, different places... I felt, as a matter of conscience, I should step down. I had a responsibility to my company.\u201d\n\nThe board unanimously agreed to support him speaking to the issue, not just as an individual, but as the CEO of Merck.\n\nOn August 14, 2017, Frazier became a visible public figure when he publicly resigned from American Manufacturing Council following Trump\u2019s polarizing response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that became violent amid clashes between protesters and counter-protesters. At the time, Trump said there were \u201cvery fine people, on both sides.\u201d\n\nIn a strongly worded statement at the time, Frazier embraced diversity while calling on leaders to \u201chonor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\u201d\n\nKenneth C.

And by doing so, he paved the way for other CEOs to follow his example, and resign from their respective councils.\n\n\u201cBeyond that, I think most of our employees, no matter where they stood politically, supported what we did because we didn\u2019t see it as a political issue. We thought this was an issue that goes against our basic values as a country,\u201d Frazier said at AMS.\n\nHe noted that some CEOs may have had \u201cmixed views\u201d about staying in the council and engaging with the administration.\n\n\u201cI happen to feel just that as a personal matter of conscience that I couldn\u2019t remain.\u201d\n\nMore recently, the president has placed blame on the impeachment proceedings on the pharmaceutical industry. To that, Frazier responded, \u201cI read that. Hmm.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, Mark Twain had a quote in the 1800s, he said, and I\u2019m not relating this to any particular person\u2019s comment, but back in the 1800s, Mark Twain said: \u2018A lie can travel halfway around the world, while the truth is putting on its shoes.\u2019 And there were no social media in the 1800s. So, I think it\u2019s really important for us as citizens in this country to think deeply about the issues that we face. We have major issues in our country today. And, I think the fact that we are often looking at Tweets or social media comments, I would hope that we would try to come together as a nation and try to see where our commonality is.\u201d\n\nMore from the All Markets Summit:\n\nPharma industry is \u2018right in the crosshairs,\u2019 Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier\n\nBig data and AI will probably keep you alive longer\n\nCFTC says ether is a commodity, and ether futures are next\n\nAll Markets Summit More\n\n\n\nJulia La Roche is a finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.
