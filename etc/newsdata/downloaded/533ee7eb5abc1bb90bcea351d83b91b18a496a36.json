How to help cure cancer AND make a profit", "language": "en", "text": "This month\u2019s breast cancer awareness campaign, backed by some of the world\u2019s leading cancer charities, has provided a sobering reminder that despite vast improvements in survival rates, more than 1,000 women a week are still diagnosed with the disease.\n\nIt is just one of scores of cancers that can strike \u2013 and it is no wonder that billions of pounds a year are being spent worldwide to find effective cures for illnesses that will strike half the population in their lifetime.\n\nResearch and development is carried out by a huge range of firms, from drug makers to artificial intelligence designers, all driven by the desire to find the holy grail of combating this most feared of diseases.\n\nResearch: More than 1,000 women a week are still diagnosed with breast cancer\n\nDan Coatsworth, stock market analyst at broker AJ Bell, says: \u2018Many people like the idea of investing in a company searching for a cancer cure. They feel they are putting their money to a good cause and hopefully making a positive return on their investment, so it is a double win.\u2019\n\nThe most obvious place for an investor to start is to purchase shares in pharmaceutical companies developing cancer-fighting drugs. But this can be risky.\n\nCoatsworth says: \u2018The downside of putting your money into pharmaceutical firms is that they can be high risk investments, particularly smaller companies which may not be generating any revenue and whose future success is pinned on a single product.\n\n\u2018Treatments must go through many tests before being approved for commercial sale. This process can be lengthy and costly \u2013 companies will often come back to investors to ask for more cash in exchange for issuing new shares. Plus there is no guarantee the treatment will work once all the trials have been done.\u2019\n\nWHERE TO INVEST IN INDIVIDUAL SHARES\n\nIf single company shares are your preference, then it is wise to focus on big name stocks with staying power rather than small companies that are more likely to crash and burn.\n\nA popular option is global pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, which has a strong focus on oncology, the branch of medicine that deals with preventing, diagnosing and treating cancer. AstraZeneca is developing treatments for breast, ovarian, pancreatic and bladder cancers.\n\nUntil a few years ago such big drug companies were out of favour because of concerns over political interference on pricing and the problem of blockbuster products losing patent (and therefore profit) protection. But the market is now looking on them more favourably.\n\nCoatsworth says: \u2018AstraZeneca\u2019s shares have been doing well over the past few years thanks to positive news on drug development, including approvals from regulators worldwide. Investors particularly liked the fact that 2018 represented its first year of sales growth since 2009.\u2019\n\nIts share price has risen nearly 60 per cent to \u00a373 in the last five years. But the stock is not risk-free as the company still must face up to the reality of its drugs eventually losing patent protection \u2013 and even being a big player does not guarantee success with new drugs.\n\nAstra's share price has risen nearly 60 per cent to \u00a373 in the last five years\n\nUS firm Merck & Co is another option \u2013 with key parts of its business working on fighting cancer as well as preventing it.\n\nJames Douglas, manager of Polar Capital Healthcare Trust, a fund with a holding in Merck, says: \u2018Merck has a drug called Keytruda which uses a patient\u2019s immune system to help fight tumours. It is clever science that, importantly, can be used for different cancers. The company has also released positive data from a trial looking at how effective it may be as a treatment to help fight triple negative breast cancer \u2013 a cancer not fuelled by hormones.\u2019\n\nIts share price has risen 40 per cent in the last five years to $83 (\u00a365).\n\nCHOOSE FUNDS TO SPREAD THE RISK\n\nIt can be prudent to spread risk by investing in a fund or investment trust that has stakes in companies working in the cancer field.\n\nThis can also widen your investment horizons as the funds also have access to private healthcare companies.\n\nINTERNATIONAL BIOTECHNOLOGY\n\nThis \u00a3224million investment trust has holdings in firms involved in different areas of the biotech and life sciences industries.\n\nAJ Bell\u2019s Coatsworth says: \u2018About a third of its assets are invested in companies focused on oncology \u2013 with rare diseases being the trust\u2019s next biggest health theme.\u2019\n\nInternational Biotechnology has holdings in firms involved in different areas of the biotech and life sciences industries\n\nThe fund is managed by SV Health Managers, part of SV Group which manages and advises a number of healthcare and life sciences venture capital funds.\n\nCoatsworth says: \u2018Investors buying this fund are putting faith in SV backing the right companies.\u2019\n\nHad you invested \u00a31,000 in the trust five years ago it would now be worth \u00a31,872.\n\nPOLAR CAPITAL GLOBAL HEALTHCARE\n\nChris Salih, investment trust expert at fund analyst FundCalibre, says a strength of this \u00a3253million trust is the pedigree of its managers \u2013 Douglas and Gareth Powell. He says: \u2018Both have a background of working in pharmaceuticals. They really know their stuff \u2013 one studied biotechnology at Oxford University and the other has a PhD in medicinal chemistry.\u2019\n\nSalih also likes how the portfolio is split between large companies (90 per cent of assets) and smaller innovation firms that have the potential for greater growth. These are typically disrupters of conventional medical practices aiming to deliver better healthcare for less money. Had you invested \u00a31,000 in the trust five years ago it would now be worth \u00a31,496.\n\nSMITH AND WILLIAMSON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n\nTim Dey, co-manager of the \u00a3202million Smith & Williamson Artificial Intelligence fund, says key holding Siemens Healthineers is contributing to the fight against cancer.\n\nRecognised for its diagnostic imaging know-how, Siemens uses an artificial intelligence tool to scour vast libraries of scan images so that potential tumours can be diagnosed more quickly. The firm listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange in March 2018.\n\nDey says: \u2018The tool is designed to help radiologists interpret images faster and more accurately, and to reduce the time involved in documenting results.\u2019\n\nAcross the world, the number of radiological examinations is growing rapidly, but the number of radiologists is not keeping pace.\n\nThe artificial intelligence system quickly eliminates images where cancer cannot be detected, thereby leaving radiologists more time to concentrate on those that look suspicious.\n\nDey says: \u2018It\u2019s a great way of concentrating resources, getting patients help faster and making the increased workload of radiologists more manageable.\u2019\n\nA \u00a31,000 investment made a year ago would now be worth about \u00a31,240.\n\nBMO RESPONSIBLE GLOBAL EQUITY\n\nNick Henderson is co-manager of this \u00a3588million fund. Thermo Fisher Scientific is a key holding, involved in developing a range of healthcare equipment and services including those focused on cancer.\n\nHe says: \u2018Not only does Thermo provide researchers with a range of breast cancer detection products, but it also offers equipment integral to cancer stem cell and immunotherapy research.\u2019\n\nOver five years a \u00a31,000 investment has grown to \u00a32,000.", "description": "The most obvious place for an investor to start is to purchase shares in pharmaceutical companies developing cancer-fighting drugs.
