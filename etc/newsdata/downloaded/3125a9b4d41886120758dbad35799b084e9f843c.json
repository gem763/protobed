Ben Askren at UFC on ESPN+ 20: Best photos view 12 images\n\nHe won\u2019t get a belt to show for it, but you might as well crown Demian Maia the UFC\u2019s \u2018BMFG\u2019: baddest motherf***ing grappler.\n\nMaia, former Brazilian jiu-jitsu world champion, asserted his grappling supremacy Saturday by defeating former college wrestling champion Ben Askren with a rear-naked choke submission in the third round of their welterweight main event at UFC on ESPN+ 20 in Singapore.\n\nThe fight\u2019s final sequence was the culmination of a back-and-forth affair that, perhaps surprisingly, featured a fair amount of striking. Both Maia and Askren were pretty even in terms of total strikes landed, with each man having success. The evidence of that could be seen on their faces.\n\nFor his part, Maia said that was part of his plan to keep the fight standing early so he could take advantage of a tired Askren when the fight hit the mat later on.\n\n\u201cI knew that I could strike in other rounds, because my nature is always to grapple,\u201d Maia said. \u201cBut I tried to get some advantages in striking to make him more tired, then go to the ground. Because he\u2019s so tough, especially on top. He\u2019s a very hard guy to fight.\u201d\n\nAskren (19-2 MMA, 1-2 UFC) showed no fear in trying to take Maia (28-9 MMA, 22-9 UFC) down to the mat, where he\u2019s most dangerous. Askren was successful on a number of occasions, which led to some intriguing grappling exchanges.\n\nIn the third round, Askren shot in for a single leg and ended on top of Maia, but it was only for a brief moment as Maia reversed the position and transitioned to taking Askren\u2019s back. With his legs locked around Askren\u2019s waist, Maia went to work with punches to open up the submission attempt. Once he sunk it in, Askren couldn\u2019t break free and went to sleep after a tap the referee didn\u2019t see.\n\n\u201cI defend well, the takedowns. But he\u2019s a great wrestler,\u201d Maia said. \u201c\u2026 I tried to change my game a little bit from the bottom, because I know he will be waiting for the halfguard, so I went to different stuff.\u201d\n\n\"There's a reason why he's the best grappler in the division, possibly in MMA history.\" @BenAskren reflects after his submission loss at #UFCSingapore pic.twitter.com/S8bYou6Zum \u2014 UFC (@ufc) October 26, 2019\n\nThe victory added to Maia\u2019s impressive UFC resume, which includes 22 wins (second most behind Donald Cerrone\u2019s 23) and 11 by submission (second behind Charles Oliveira\u2019s 13). Of those submission victories, nine have come by way of rear-naked choke.\n\nAs for Askren, it\u2019s back to the drawing board. The former Bellator and ONE Championship title hold entered the UFC undefeated and is now on a two-fight losing streak.", "description": "There's no question who the best grappler is in the UFC after Demian Maia's win at UFC Singapore.", "authors": ["Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "Farah Hannoun", "Matt Erickson"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/demian-maia-ben-askren-ufc-singapore.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
