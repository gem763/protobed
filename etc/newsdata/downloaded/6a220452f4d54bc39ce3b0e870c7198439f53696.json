The market share of wind and solar renewables has risen from four per cent to 21 per cent in less than a decade.\n\nEmbedded within a quota, roof-top solar subsidies have been among the most effective but high cost price signals in Australian history \u2013 and also the most disruptive to an electricity grid traditionally built around less flexible coal.\n\nThe Australian Financial Review Energy Summit heard this week that nearly half of the householders who have put up panels did so not to save the planet, but to free themselves from energy companies \u2013 where electricity prices have risen 57 per cent in a decade. But in doing so they have helped drive the anarchy on the national grid that has pushed up prices.\n\nIt was clear at this year\u2019s summit that the unbalanced transition from fossil to renewable is just getting worse in some respects. Far more often than most people realise, wholesale prices in the National Electricity Market are frequently swinging from near zero at midday to hitting their government price caps during the night, keeping consumer prices high while undermining the economics of the coal-fired baseload power that the system depends on.\n\nEnergy minister Angus Taylor Australian Financial Review\n\nIntegrated power companies EnergyAustralia and Origin told the summit that the chaos could even leave the fate of their flagship plants like Victoria\u2019s Yallourn or Eraring in NSW out of their hands well before they become obsolete in the 2030s. Regulators warn that the surge of renewables threatens the technical security of the grid in a way that could blow up people\u2019s hair dryers or fridges.", "description": "A truce that sees energy and climate policy reconciled can't be reached.
