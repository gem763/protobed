'Ronald has always indicated that he wants to be a coach in Barcelona one day. We'll see what will happen.'\n\nHoogma admitted that a good display by Holland at Euro 2020 could lead to interest from Barcelona should they decide to axe current boss Ernesto Valverde, but is focusing on Koeman's future with the side and is looking to the 2022 World Cup.\n\nKoeman has rejuvenated the Dutch players, who are on the brink of Euro 2020 qualification\n\nHe enjoyed a trophy-laden spell as a Barcelona player, winning 12 honours across six years\n\n'Success with the Dutch team can help you (to go to Barcelona) but I hope we finish the process and be together until the World Cup in Qatar. I hope we can work together for a long time, because I think it's going very well.'\n\nThere is no current indication that Barcelona are looking to get rid of Valverde, but his future will almost certainly depend on the successes of the current season.\n\nLionel Messi and co top the La Liga table as it stands with 19 points, but Real Madrid are breathing down their necks and are just one point behind.\n\nKoeman joined Barcelona in 1989 and played 350 games for the club, scoring 106 times and winning twelve trophies.", "description": "The former Everton boss has been leading his national side since February 2018 after being sacked by the Toffees in 2017 following a run of poor results.", "authors": ["Oli Gamp For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/13/19955190-0-image-a-118_1571573402362.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
