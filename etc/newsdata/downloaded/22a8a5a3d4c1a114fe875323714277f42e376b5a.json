He can also play in domestic games.\n\nHassan reacted aggressively after being shown a yellow card for a foul in the first half of Al Sadd's 4-1 first-leg loss to Saudi club Al Hilal in Doha on Oct. 1.\n\nThe AFC says the defender \"was expelled by the referee for an act of violent conduct against a match official.\"\n\nThe five-month ban removes Hassan from this year's Asian Champions League and three group games in the 2020 edition. Al Sadd already qualified as Qatar league champion, which also earned a Club World Cup place as the host nation's domestic title winner.\n\nHassan won the AFC's 2018 award as the best player based in Asia. He helped Qatar win the 2019 Asian Cup in February and played in the 2019 Copa America in Brazil.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
