Vietnam's prime minister has called for an investigation into the case.\n\nPolice in Britain said on Saturday they had charged one man, 25-year-old Maurice Robinson of Craigavon in Northern Ireland, with 39 counts of manslaughter and other offences including conspiracy to traffic people.\n\nInitially, British police believed the victims were Chinese, but later sought help from the Vietnamese community. Chinese and Vietnamese officials were both working closely with British police, the countries' embassies said.\n\nA Catholic priest in the remote town of Yen Thanh in Nghe An province said on Saturday that he believed most of the dead were likely from Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n\nNO DOCUMENTS\n\nBritish police have said very few of the victims were carrying official identification and that they hope to identify the dead through fingerprints, dental records and DNA, as well as photos from friends and relatives.\n\nIn the predominantly Catholic area of northern Vietnam from which the suspected victims came, churches held candle-lit prayers at the weekend.\n\nApart from the man charged, who will appear in court on Monday for an initial hearing, three other people are under arrest in Britain on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking. A fourth person is under arrest in Dublin.\n\nHow the victims came to be in the truck is not yet known.\n\nSome 70% of Vietnamese trafficking cases in the United Kingdom between 2009-2016 were for labour exploitation, including cannabis production and work in nail salons, according to a British government report last year.\n\nThe families of the suspected victims were in Nghe An and Ha Tinh, two of the poorest provinces in communist Vietnam.\n\nNghe An was identified as home to many victims of human trafficking who end up in Europe, according to a March report by the Pacific Links Foundation, a U.S.-based anti-trafficking organisation.\n\nHa Tinh was ravaged by one of Vietnam's worst environmental disasters in 2016 when a steel mill owned by Taiwan's Formosa Plastics contaminated coastal waters, devastating local fishing and tourism industries.\n\nIt was from Ha Tinh that Tra My set out, first to China, in the hope of making it to Britain via France. According to Human Rights Space, a civic network based in Vietnam, she sent one final apologetic message home.\n\n\"I'm sorry, mum and dad. My path abroad was not a success. I love you both so much. I can\u2019t breathe. I'm from Nghen Town, Can Loc District, Ha Tinh, Vietnam ... I am sorry, mum,\" the message said.
