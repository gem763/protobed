Hackney council in London has previously closed roads outside five schools.\n\nRoad transport accounts for 26 per cent of the UK\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, with the main sources being petrol and diesel cars.", "description": "Walking and cycling charity, Sustrans, surveyed 954 parents across the UK and found that three-quarters are worried about the health impact of car exhaust fumes.", "authors": ["Daily Mail Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/23/00/18800138-0-image-a-37_1569194461167.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
