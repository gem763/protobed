Let me explain why this is not just a DA phenomenon.\n\nFrom Trump\u2019s America to Brexit, the world is moving to the right.\n\nSeveral countries in Europe have recorded surprising rapid and widespread rise of nationalistic politics.\n\nAnalysts suggest that we are likely to see the resilience of conservatism for at least a decade.\n\nBack to the Democratic Alliance. I was surprised that the panel report which blamed the DA\u2019s decline on Maimane\u2019s leadership failed to examine the broader global and national questions which inevitably undermined the performance of the DA in the past general elections.\n\nTwo points come to mind.\n\nFirst, there is no question that Ramaphosa\u2019s ANC is more stable than Zuma\u2019s and therefore more challenging to opposition parties.\n\nSecond, Ramaphosa\u2019s ANC seems to have retreated from the overtly left leaning posture of Zuma\u2019s ANC, towards the centre.\n\nThe consequence is that most South Africans, black and white, who are not attracted to the extreme versions of racial identity would feel reasonably comfortable to vote for the ANC.\n\nIt seems to me that if the panel used loss of votes as a performance indicator, it then needed to examine the geo-political winds which the DA was sailing within.\n\nTo pin the problem of lower votes to poor leadership is rather linear and, in my judgement, a reductionist analysis of the causes and effects of voter growth.\n\nThere is a more uncomfortable reality.\n\nWhile Maimane\u2019s vision for racial transformation of the DA is a noble one, strategically it is a steep climb.\n\nThis is because the global moment of right leaning politics provide a fertile ground for the rise of localised nationalisms.\n\nTo protect nationalistic interests is now in fashion in most parts of the world, not least in South Africa where nationalism takes the form of racial identity.\n\nIn 2016 I argued that post-apartheid order only started roughly two decades after 1994, because the project of reconciliation had taken a fragile outlook to conversations about race.\n\nUnder the new (post- apartheid) order, South Africans from both sides of the racial aisle are bolder, more aggressive and more confrontational on issues they consider as racial.\n\nAnd most issues are racial.\n\nThus AfriForum is no longer moderate; Freedom Front Plus and the Economic Freedom Fighters are the fastest growing parties in South Africa.\n\nThe result of such order is that Zille, who started off as an anti-apartheid activist in the late 1970s and ended up as a defender of colonialism and white privilege three decades later, could be so popular within the party so as to get elected to the chair position of the federal council.\n\nThe tensions along racial lines within the DA have always been there, and Maimane took leadership perhaps more optimistic on his ability to move towards a more tolerant racial discourse.\n\nOr perhaps he misread the potential of emerging politics of nationalistic interests, no less than the Democrats in the United States misread the momentum of the \u201cright\u201d even on the eve of the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nI suggest that the centre right seems to be pulling further away from the centre, and therefore a split is no longer a matter of if, it is a question of when. The race to save the DA, as Zille puts it, is an ideological quest.\n\nIt is an agenda aimed at redeeming conservative interests from drift to the left.\n\nTo modify Danish author Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s tale, Maimane\u2019s racial transformation efforts would have left the conservative empire without clothes. They wouldn\u2019t sit by and wait for such tragedy.\n\nDr Jason Musyoka is a senior researcher at the Centre for the Advancement of Scholarship, University of Pretoria", "description": "The rise of Helen Zille as the new chair of the federal council of the Democratic Alliance was unforeseen, not least because most South Africans expected her to bow into retirement.", "authors": ["Jason Musyoka"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7949/429fa11f65ed450abde7d312f4d55575.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
