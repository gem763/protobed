In the same release, Muilenburg emphasized that the company is \u201claser-focused\u201d on returning to service the 737 Max jetliner, which was grounded by regulators worldwide after two deadly crashes killed 356 people.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe move is an important C-suite reshuffling for Boeing in the run-up to the anticipated re-certification of the Max, as the company seeks to convince global regulators, pilots and fliers that it is committed to product safety.\n\nLate last month the company announced the creation of a new internal product safety organization to be headed by 34-year Boeing veteran Beth Pasztor. And the company plans to add a new board member who has \u201cdeep safety experience\" in the near future.\n\nFor almost a year Boeing has been working with the Federal Aviation Administration on a set of software fixes designed to account for an automated feature that played a role in two deadly crashes. After initially announcing that it would submit the fix for FAA review no later than April, the timeline for returning the Max to service has been continually pushed back. Some airlines are now preparing for a 737 Max grounding that could extend into 2020. The FAA has not committed to a firm timeline to lift the grounding order.\n\nIn the meantime, Boeing and its suppliers have been suffering financially. Boeing recently posted a $3.38 billion loss in the most recent quarter, the worst in company history.\n\nAD", "description": "Boeing announced Friday evening that it is separating its CEO and board chairman roles, the latest corporate reshuffling to come as the company seeks approval for its embattled 737 MAX jet.", "authors": ["Aaron Gregg", "Reporter Covering The Defense Industry", "Commercial Aviation", "Government Contractors."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iPNlhD4xWbTjI5MMw7vu3CxYG3w=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4USTKHHFHQI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
