But even we weren't prepared for LG's 'hold my beer' price tag.\n\nHow The Battle Of Winterfell Looked On An 8K TV If your Game of Thrones experience was the same as mine this week, you would have been treated to unwatchable 720p blotches of black, grey and brown, stretched across a cinema-sized screen. It wasn't cute. So when I was offered the chance to try out Samsung's brand new 8K TV, I knew what I was morally obliged to shove in my eyeballs. What do we say to the God of bad picture quality? Not today. Read more\n\nThe 88Z9 is the world's first 8K OLED TV. Being 8K, it has a 7,680 x 4,320 resolution and 33 million pixels, which is sixteen-times those found in Full HD and four-times more than 4K.\n\nOf course, there still isn't any 8K content out in the wild besides test videos, so like other 8K manufacturers, LG is pushing the upscaling narrative. This means that lower quality content such as 4K, HD and even 720p should still look good on an 8K television.\n\nWe have tested this ourselves on both Samsung and Sony 8K TVs.\n\nThis is largely due to the processor. In the case of the 88ZR, it has an Alpha 9 Gen 2 Intelligent Processor which LG says has a six-step upscaling process to help sharpen the image and reduce noise. AI has also been applied to the source material as when as the room you're watching in to optimise your viewing experience. LG confirmed its upscaling will work on SD, Full HD and 4K content.\n\nSimilar to other LG OLEDs, the 88ZR uses a combination of Dolby Vision, HDR10 PRO and Advanced HDR by Technicolor in conjunction with the on-board processor. Together, they tweak the image tone mapping of the content to make the resulting picture more lifelike. It also works to optimise the sound settings in order to make the viewing experience more immersive.\n\nThis all sounds excellent. And from what we briefly saw of LG 8K's on the show floor of CES earlier this year, they're beautiful TVs. But so are the 8Ks that competitors are selling locally. So why is it $60,000, or roughly triple the price of its closest competitors in Australia?\n\nComparatively, Samsung's 82-inch QLED offering has an RRP of $17,499 and Sony's 85-inch Z9G is $21,995. Sony's original RRP for the Z9G was $26,399 at the end of August. One month later, it's already dropped by $5000. This is certainly telling on the adoption rate of 8K TVs and how the high prices probably aren't panning out.\n\nIt also explains why Samsung doesn't advertise the price or sell its 98-inch 8K on its website (it also isn't stocked by many retailers) as it is an eye-bulging $99,999.\n\nWe Made Sony's $26,000 8K TV Easier To Swolo Sony just announced its first ever consumer 8K TV, and it's truly a thing of beauty. Unfortunately for us peasants, it also comes with an eye-bulging price tag. Being professionals, we were morally obliged to show off its capabilities with something else that bulges.

In addition to being thinner and more flexible than LED screens, it also eliminates the need for a backlight. Each pixel can turn on and off depending on the specific light needs of the time, which can result in more vivid images and deeper blacks.\n\nSamsung's QLED screens add a quantum dot film to a LED LCD panel. When the backlight hits them, they give off their own different coloured light, travel through the layers of the screen and then create an image.\n\nFrom a surface level perspective, the biggest advantages to QLED are that the screens tend to be brighter, as well as cheaper to manufacture.\n\nBut while OLED screens are generally considered to be superior, dropping three times the amount of cash on ones is questionable.\n\nEven when you take the cost of OLED production into account, $60K seems like a stretch. Even LG's brand new 77-inch 4K W9 OLED comes in at $19,999. Is 8K and eleven extra inches really worth so much more?\n\nThe 88ZR probably offers an absolutely beautiful viewing experience, but you have to wonder whether Aussies interested in 8K in 2019 will be willing to shell out so much more when the majority of 8K televisions on the market aren't that different from one another. OLED panels may be gorgeous and all, but we're not sure that's enough to justify the exorbitant cost.\n\nGizmodo Australia has reached out to LG locally for comment regarding the pricing of the 88ZR. We will report back if they get back to us.", "description": "LG recently announced the arrival of its first 8K television in Australia.
