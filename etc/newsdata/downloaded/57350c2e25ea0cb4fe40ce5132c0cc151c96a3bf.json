It can increase the likelihood of securing a good job or starting your own business. Fee-paying schools allow parents to make a financial investment in their child\u2019s education in the face of investment gaps and flaws in the state sector. For black families, those gaps are wider, and the need greater.\n\nThat is the reality the Labour Party has failed to grasp in its case for the abolition of fee-paying schools.\n\nThe independent school sector trades on its ability to bring access to smaller class sizes, increased parental involvement, specialist teachers, a community environment, ample resources and a greater breadth of extra-curricular activities.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIts goal is to secure an advantage for your child in return for money. But Labour, quite reasonably you might think, has taken a position that \u201cchildren's life chances should not depend on parental wealth.\u201d People have long argued that the private school system is unfair as it impedes social mobility.\n\nBased on findings from the Sutton Trust, privately educated MPs made up about 39 per cent of the cabinet in spring this year. And alumni from independent schools made-up 59 per cent of permanent secretaries in the civil service and two-thirds of senior judges. Crucially though, these numbers not only reveal the advantage of attending a fee-paying school, but also the disadvantage of attending a state school, and those are disadvantages exacerbated if you are black and if you live in London.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In previous generations, black people\u2019s background and upbringing would have differed greatly based on their African or Caribbean heritage \u2013 the black experience is nothing if not nuanced.\n\nPeople from working class Afro-Caribbean families have always had to work twice as hard for half the success. However, there\u2019s a change happening; there\u2019s a new wave of black people with working class values propelling them through their careers to cross the invisible line, becoming part of a rapidly expanding black middle class.\n\nAnd they are faced with the reality that career ambitions are limited by the age of seven due to differences in social background, class, race and gender, according to a recent report by the OECD. Schooling is at the core of everything we do as children, laying the foundations for who we become as adults. Looking at black children specifically, there are reports of biased teachers with unconscious prejudices which impact how they are disciplined and assessed.\n\nThe impact of systemic racism is colossal and state school failures could be deemed the first steps in a downward spiral resulting in young black Caribbean boys becoming marginalised and losing out on a solid education.\n\nNow let\u2019s consider the threat of exposure to gangs, where victims and perpetrators are disproportionately disadvantaged, poor and black.\n\nSimply put, there is an impact of social class and ethnicity on education, which makes the pursuit of anything which can counter that all the more important for black people.\n\nBlack children within the state school system face prejudice, stereotyping and bias \u2013 particularly when it comes to the ways they are grouped, assessed and disciplined. And that means the motive for sending black children to private school stems from shortcomings in the current state education system \u2013 with many families making huge sacrifices for the privilege.\n\nShould we really give up that opportunity as black middle-class parents to break the cycle for our children?\n\nWhat gives the Labour Party the right to dictate anyone\u2019s educational path or hinder their career trajectory? A private education isn\u2019t automatically superior, but unless your child attends a top state school, is academically gifted or pushed to excel; the distressing likelihood for a black family is that your child will underperform in a state school.\n\nShadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott sent her son to a fee-paying school and Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti\u2019s son attends Dulwich College. The leader, Jeremy Corbyn, also attended a private prep school. They should not chastise us for electing to front the cost of private school education while state schools still fail to meet the requirements of parents with black children.\n\nFor many of us, the education system needs a shake-up before we can consider state school as a realistic option.", "description": "A solid education can open doors to your future.
