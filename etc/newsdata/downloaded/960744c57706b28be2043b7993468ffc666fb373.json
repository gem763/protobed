(Pat Martel/CBC, Nimbus Publishing)\n\n\"Dutch Thompson has had a program on our local CBC Radio station for 29 years talking about stories of islanders born between 1895 and 1925. He's recorded over 900 hours of oral history of islanders stories with this book. The book is popular with people who get excited when they discover a relative's story has been memorialized in the pages of this book.\"\n\nThe Wake is a nonfiction book by Linden MacIntyre. (Joe Passaretti, HarperCollins Canada)\n\n\"This book tells the deadly legacy of a Newfoundland tsunami in 1929. It reads like a novel. It describes the resilience and bravery of the Newfoundland people, including their generosity throughout the hardship and loss. It's also the story of how unscrupulous, corrupt capitalism and an inept government prolonged the hardship and suffering. It's a story that people should know about.\"\n\nDan MacDonald's comments have been edited for length and clarity.", "description": "The Bookmark is an independent bookstore in Atlantic Canada with locations in Halifax and Charlottetown.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5334324.1571949475!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/dan-macdonald-co-owner-of-the-bookmark-in-halifax-and-charlottetown-he-spoke-about-the-popular-boo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
