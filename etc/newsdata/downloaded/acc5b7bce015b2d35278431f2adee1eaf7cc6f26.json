(Dustin Chambers/The New York Times)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facing down 600 wildfires in the past three days alone, emergency workers rushed to evacuate tens of thousands of people in Southern California on Thursday as a state utility said one of its major transmission lines broke near the source of the out-of-control Kincade blaze in Northern California.\n\nThe Kincade fire, the largest this week, tore through steep canyons in the wine country of northern Sonoma County, racing across 16,000 acres within hours of igniting. Wind gusts pushed the fire through forests like blowtorches, leaving firefighters with little opportunity to stop or slow down the walls of flames tromping across wild lands and across highways overnight.\n\nAnd north of Los Angeles, 50,000 people were evacuated as strong winds propelled fires into the canyons of Santa Clarita, threatening many homes.\n\nAerial footage of the Kincade fire showed homes engulfed in flames propelled by high winds that could become even stronger in the coming days.\n\nBut beyond the destruction, which appeared limited Thursday to several dozen buildings, hundreds of thousands of people were affected, both by the fires and a deliberate blackout meant to prevent them. Schools and businesses closed, and thousands of people evacuated their homes.\n\nAll this is happening after three straight years of record-breaking fires that researchers say are likely to continue in a warming world and which raise an important question: How to live in an ecosystem that is primed to burn?\n\n\u201cI think the perception is that we\u2019re supposed to control them. But in a lot of cases we cannot,\u201d said John Abatzoglou, an associate professor at the University of Idaho. \u201cAnd that may allow us to think a little bit differently about how we live with fire. We call it wildfire for reason \u2014 it\u2019s not domesticated fire.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Climate Assessment, the government report that summarizes present and future effects of a warming climate on the United States, fire is a growing problem. Climate change will lead to more wildfires nationwide as hotter temperatures dry out plants, making them easier to ignite.\n\nThe total area burned in a single year by wildfires in the United States has only exceeded 13,900 square miles \u2014 an area larger than the country of Belgium \u2014 four times since the middle of last century. All four times have happened this decade, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA.\n\n\u201cThere is anger in the community,\u201d said Michael Gossman, the deputy county administrator of Sonoma County\u2019s office of recovery and resilience, in an interview this year. In 2017 his California county was devastated by the Sonoma Complex fires, which killed 24 and burned more than 170 square miles. Gov. Gavin Newsom said the conditions this week were analogous to those of 2017.\n\nMany residents in Northern California faced a twin threat on Thursday: fires, but also the deliberate power outages meant to mitigate the blazes. Both the Kincade fire and a small fire that ignited Thursday morning, the Spring fire, occurred in or near areas where the state utility, Pacific Gas & Electric had turned off the power.\n\nThe fires \u201cbrought out some longer standing institutional issues around equity,\u201d Gossman said. Critics say electricity cutoffs disproportionately harm low income people who cannot afford solar and battery backup systems or gas based generators, as well as sick and disabled people who rely on electricity to run lifesaving medical equipment.\n\nAlthough winds in California were forecast to subside later on Thursday, officials warned that the extreme winds and dry conditions that create high risk for fires could return on Sunday. This is why government agencies are preparing themselves to deal with fires that are increasingly seen as inevitable.\n\nPrescribed burns, or planned fires, like one set last spring on Brawley Mountain in Georgia in southern Appalachia roughly 100 miles north of Atlanta, are often seen as part of the solution.\n\nThe idea that fire could itself be used to help fight fire and restore ecosystems first gained institutional acceptance in the South. In 1958 a policy change was made to allow for the first prescribed burn in a national park, at Everglades National Park in Florida.\n\nFor some time, the practice remained anomalous outside of the South. But within the south, according to Nathan Klaus, a senior wildlife biologist with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, even private landowners would occasionally set smaller, controlled fires on their property.", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Facing down 600 wildfires in the past three days alone, emergency workers rushed to evacuate tens of thousands of people in Southern California on Thursday as a state utility said one of its major transmission lines broke near the source of the out-of-control Kincade blaze in Northern", "authors": ["Thomas Fuller", "Kendra Pierre-Louis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0trr5iPvcSXIWRiB66htOw--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/4648ae4ffcd330b568f0103d42fff547", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
