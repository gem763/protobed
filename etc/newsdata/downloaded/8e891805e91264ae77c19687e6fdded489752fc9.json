(Gregory S. Schneider/The Washington Post)\n\nSometimes revenge is best served swelteringly hot by the swimming pool with a plate of barbecue.\n\nSo it was Wednesday night when Virginia Democrats officially embraced Joe Morrissey, the bad-boy former delegate and disbarred lawyer who defied the party to reenter politics.\n\n[Issues of race and scandal pulse through Virginia primary contest]\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here for Joe,\u201d former governor Terry McAuliffe told a crowd of about 150 at Morrissey\u2019s Richmond home for a fundraiser Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to having him in our caucus,\u201d state Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax) proclaimed.\n\nThe show of love capped weeks of wooing by Democrats \u2014 and some Republicans \u2014 as Election Day draws closer and Morrissey\u2019s political rebirth seems assured. Morrissey knocked out a fellow Democrat and establishment favorite, state Sen. Rosalyn R. Dance (Petersburg), in the June primary. He has no Republican challenger in next month\u2019s election, making him a shoo-in.\n\nDemocrats feel achingly close to a majority in the Senate, where Republicans are defending a 20-to-19 edge, with one vacancy.\n\nIf Democrats manage to draw even or take a one-seat advantage, then the formerly shunned and famously mercurial Morrissey becomes crucial to a Democratic hold on the majority.\n\n[Virginia Democrats worry about \u2018Fightin\u2019 Joe\u2019 Morrissey and his maverick ways]\n\n\u201cMost powerful man in Virginia,\u201d is how conservative radio host John Fredericks put it. A Trump supporter and self-proclaimed \u201cGodzilla of the Truth,\u201d Fredericks said his friend Morrissey will not be afraid to go his own way in the Senate. \u201cHe\u2019s an independent thinker, not beholden to any party,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nTop Virginia Democrats, including former governor Terry McAuliffe, second from right, gathered at a fundraiser in Richmond on Oct. 2. (Gregory S. Schneider/The Washington Post)\n\nMorrissey\u2019s mere presence in the Senate would have been unthinkable to Democrats in 2014, when they forced him to resign his seat in the House of Delegates after pleading guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Morrissey, then 56, had been accused of having sex with his 17-year-old receptionist, Myrna Warren.\n\nA former prosecutor and defense lawyer, Morrissey has been jailed twice for punching someone, won an election from jail and has lost his law license in part because of the relationship with Warren. The two are now married and have three children together, and she introduced Saslaw at the fundraiser Wednesday.\n\n\n\nMyrna Warren and Joe Morrissey pose for a portrait during Halloween with their three children and a child from Morrissey\u2019s previous relationship. (Family photo)\n\nDemocrats had worked hard to keep Morrissey from being the nominee for this Senate seat, which represents a sliver of Richmond, parts of Henrico and Chesterfield counties and the city of Petersburg. It is heavily African American, and Democrats put big resources behind Dance, a black former mayor of Petersburg. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) campaigned for Dance, while Morrissey refused to debate her as long as the state party insisted on running the event.\n\nMorrissey is white but is something of a rock star in many low-income African American neighborhoods, where he has a long record of defending clients against criminal charges. He wound up defeating Dance by a huge margin. His only opponent now is a lightly funded independent.\n\nOver the summer, Democrats began tiptoeing back to Morrissey. He had a beer with McAuliffe, as first reported by the Richmond Times-Dispatch, and kept in contact with Northam\u2019s chief of staff and the head of Northam\u2019s political action committee. Last week, Northam\u2019s PAC gave Morrissey $5,000.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be so arrogant to say they\u2019re wooing me, other than to say they\u2019ve been very, very supportive,\u201d Morrissey said in an interview.\n\nHe drove up to Northern Virginia to chat with Saslaw, the most powerful Democrat in the Senate. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I was very candid,\u201d Morrissey said. \u201cI reviewed a few things that had occurred with me, how I felt I had been treated by the Democrats, and he listened very attentively. I would say he was very sincere.\u201d\n\nOther senators reached out, including Republicans, he said. Morrissey is antiabortion and has been coy about how he would approach abortion-related issues in the General Assembly. But he declined to specify what he discussed with Republicans.\n\n\u201cAll I\u2019ll say is there have not been any asks on either side, just sincere, supportive comments,\u201d he said.\n\nParty officials initially said Wednesday\u2019s fundraiser and coming-out party would be closed to the media, but Morrissey said he wanted it open. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t you hear what I say to folks that I\u2019m trying to raise money from?\u201d he said.\n\nAs McAuliffe arrived at Morrissey\u2019s white-columned home in a comfortable Northside Richmond neighborhood, he said it was the 93rd political event he\u2019s attended this year on behalf of Democrats. All 140 seats in the legislature are on the Nov. 5 ballot, and McAuliffe has thrown himself into fundraising and rallying party support after Northam was politically wounded by the blackface scandal earlier this year.\n\n\u201cJoe is going to be a Democratic senator,\u201d McAuliffe said in an interview, explaining why he agreed to attend. \u201cI already sat with Joe a couple of weeks ago \u2014 he agrees with me 100 percent.\u201d\n\nWith the possibility of getting majorities in both the House and Senate in fall elections, Democrats can take major actions, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to raise the minimum wage, got to get common-sense gun restrictions here in the state of Virginia, and every vote is important.\u201d\n\nOne area of possible friction: abortion restrictions. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring that up. I don\u2019t think he agrees with me on that,\u201d said McAuliffe, who touted his work on behalf of women\u2019s health issues.\n\nMcAuliffe threatened to pull out of the fundraiser after Fredericks, the radio host and emcee of the event, announced that he was inviting antiabortion activist Victoria Cobb.\n\n\u201cI called and said \u2018I\u2019m not coming,\u2019 \u201d McAuliffe said. \u201cSo she was disinvited.\u201d\n\n\n\nDemocratic state Senate candidate Joe Morrissey speaks at a fundraiser at his home in Richmond on Oct. 2. (Bob Brown/AP)\n\nMorrissey was on his best behavior Wednesday, lavishly praising McAuliffe for his work restoring voting rights to felons and reminiscing about knocking on doors for Saslaw\u2019s campaign when he was fresh out of college. He listed several legislative priorities, such as setting up a system of drug courts to help addicts avoid jail, restoring felon voting rights automatically and reestablishing a system of parole.\n\nBut he also named several Republican senators not in attendance whose bills he plans to support.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobody in the General Assembly when I go in there that I\u2019m not going to reach out to on the other side,\u201d Morrissey told the poolside gathering on an unseasonably hot night. \u201cIt is not my first go-around in the General Assembly,\u201d he added, and then referred to a quote from Northam: \u201cWe come first as Virginians, and then as Democrats and Republicans.\u201d\n\nAfterward, several people who said they ordinarily donate to Republican candidates praised Morrissey for cutting a unique path. \u201cHe always answers his phone, answers email \u2014 he\u2019s not removed from the people,\u201d said Mike Dickinson, who manages several strip clubs and said he is a \u201cTrump Republican.\u201d Morrissey is not judgmental of his occupation, he said. \u201cHe accepts us.\u201d\n\nAs the crowd of lobbyists, party donors and friends from Morrissey\u2019s long career began to disperse, one local politician smiled at the spectacle. \u201cThese are the same people who put PAC funds in his opponent,\u201d said the politician, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic.\n\n\u201cAnd now they\u2019re down here in Richmond supporting him,\u201d the person said. \u201cIt\u2019s just politics, man.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Joe Morrissey, assured of a state Senate seat, is now seen by other Democrats as key to a majority.", "authors": ["Gregory S.
