That was the first time I\u2019ve ever had matcha. I hope this is the right one, by the way, because we were looking through my pantry and I was like, I think that\u2019s it. But that\u2019s how I even became aware of matcha, and this was before matcha lattes were everywhere. They made it the traditional way with a specific water temperature. Then I ordered the powder and started making lattes with it \u2014 the recipe\u2019s on Poosh, it\u2019s like, literally the best matcha latte I\u2019ve ever had in my life.\n\nI\u2019ve been practicing making it at home for so long. And whenever I have a friend over and we\u2019re hanging out, I love to make matcha lattes \u2014 especially in the summer, it\u2019s just so good. I don\u2019t have coffee, so I pretty much have one matcha latte every day. I love it with oat milk, but even though it\u2019s gluten-free, my doctor still doesn\u2019t love me, with my gluten allergies, to have it, so I make it with almond milk and maple syrup.", "description": "Kourtney Kardashian shares her favorite things, including Lyposheric vitamin C, Slip Silk Pillowcases, Cotton Jump Rope, Oxygenetix Foundation, Elta MD Sunscreen, and Poosh x Saje Diffuser.", "authors": ["Kourtney Kardashian", "Simone Kitchens"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/10/23/wiclw/23-wiclw-kourtney-kardashian.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
