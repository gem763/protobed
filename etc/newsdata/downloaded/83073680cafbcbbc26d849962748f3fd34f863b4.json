It petitioned the Turkish Constitutional Court in May 2017 after talks with Turkish officials and a challenge in lower courts failed. Wikipedia is also appealing the ban at the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nA group of five justices took up Wikipedia\u2019s case on Wednesday but decided to submit it to the high court\u2019s plenary assembly for deliberations. The court will decide whether the government\u2019s blanket blocking order on Wikipedia violates freedom of expression. It was not immediately clear when a decision would come.\n\n\u201cWe did not comply with the demand to remove the articles because we believed that the content in question was legally protected free expression and because we defend our volunteer editors\u2019 decisions about what information should be included on Wikipedia,\u201d said Samantha Lien, the communications manager for Wikimedia Foundation, which runs the website.\n\n\u201cDespite the block, the articles in question have continued to be edited and improved with more reliable sources from volunteers around the world,\u201d Lien told The Associated Press in an email.\n\nLast year, Wikipedia launched a social media campaign with the hashtag \u201cWeMissTurkey\u201d to press for the removal of the block.\n\n\u201cWikipedia is richer, more representative and more accurate when many people can contribute to its articles,\u201d Lien said. \u201cIf we lose one country, region, or culture\u2019s participation on Wikipedia, the entire world is poorer for it.\u201d\n\nTurkey has a poor record on censorship and suppression of free speech, which intensified following a failed military coup in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government. Tens of thousands of people were arrested or dismissed from government jobs and thousands of media organizations or civil society groups were shut in a clampdown in the aftermath of the coup attempt.\n\nThe Turkish Journalists Syndicate says a total of 131 journalists or other media workers are currently in jail.\n\nAccess from Turkey to tens of thousands of other websites is also blocked. In 2008, Turkey prevented access to YouTube for two years over videos insulting the Turkish republic\u2019s founding leader. Twitter, meanwhile, says it receives more requests for content removal from Turkey than from other countries.\n\nMany Turks have found ways to circumvent the ban on Wikipedia and other blocked websites, including the use of Virtual Private Network and mirror websites.\n\nCurrently, Wikipedia is also blocked in China.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Turkey's highest court on Wednesday began considering an appeal by Wikipedia aiming to reverse the Turkish government's more than two-year ban on the online encyclopedia.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Suzan Fraser"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
