In January 2018, Carrie Gracie, the organization\u2019s China editor at the time, resigned from her post in protest of pay inequality with her male colleagues, which she called \u201csecretive and illegal.\u201d\n\nGracie also weighed in on the debate prompted by the company\u2019s treatment of Munchetty.\n\n\u201cUnease among #BBC journalists for whom \u2018go back\u2019 = racist,\u201d Gracie wrote on Twitter. \u201cExplain @BBCNaga reprimand please.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company", "description": "LONDON -- The BBC's director general has reversed the findings of a commission that ruled that Naga Munchetty, a veteran BBC news anchor, breached the company's editorial guidelines when she criticized President Donald Trump for saying that four female U.S. lawmakers should return to the \"", "authors": ["Iliana Magra"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png"}
