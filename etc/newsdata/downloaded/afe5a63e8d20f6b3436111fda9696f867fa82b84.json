From the war to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait through the agonized response of the West to the genocides in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, the American-led countries of the West showed during the 1990s that they were losing the capacity to think strategically apart from moral concerns regarding the treatment of citizens within sovereign nations. It was in this period that the idea of fighting wars out of a \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d victims of injustice within countries first took strong hold in the minds of policymakers.\n\nBut it was only after the spectacular terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, that this humanitarian impulse fully united with thinking about America\u2019s national interests. Now foreign policy analysts across the center-right and center-left thought and spoke in terms of vast tautologies that equated what was good for America with what was good for the West, good for Israel and the rest of the Middle East, and good for humanity everywhere. To disagree with America\u2019s actions in the world was to make oneself an enemy of civilization itself. You were either with us or with the nihilistic terrorists.\n\nThis mode of thinking reached an apex of sorts in George W. Bush\u2019s second inaugural address, which defended his own militaristic foreign policy as motived by nothing less than the goal of \u201cending tyranny in our world\u201d and explicitly asserted that \u201cAmerica\u2019s vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Damon Linker", "Theweek.Com Articles Does-America-Have-Moral-Imperative-Stay-Afghanistan-Forever"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
