Indeed the former Cowboy, who won two premierships, bought just 50m from where the family have called home for the past six years.\n\nThey have spent $850,000 in Townsville\u2019s Rowes Bay securing a three-bedroom, original 1960s home that had last been advertised as a $260-a-week rental in 2017. Their own house cost $1.2 million.\n\nThurston\u2019s portfolio of six investment properties that cost $2.95 million does include an apartment in Leichhardt, bought when he was at the Bulldogs.
