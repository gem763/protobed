He lamented how roads \"are opposite\" in Europe.\n\nThe world leader added: \"I believe it was going down the wrong way because that happens in Europe.\n\n\"You go to Europe and the roads are opposite.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"It's very tough, if you're from the United States you do make that decision to make a right turn where you're supposed to make a left turn, the roads are opposite.\n\n\"She said that's what happened.\n\n\"That happens to a lot of people, by the way.\"\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nSacoolas has said she is \"disappointed\" not to have met the family today.\n\nA statement issued by Anne Sacoolas' lawyer Amy Jeffress said: \"We are trying to handle the matter privately and look forward to hearing from the family or their representatives.\n\n\"Anne accepted the invitation to the White House with the hope that the family would meet and was disappointed.\"", "description": "Harry Dunn's grieving parents stood up to Donald Trump at the White House in latest discussions about Anne Sacoolas", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20636772.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_President-Trump-Hosts-Italian-President-Sergio-Mattarella-At-The-White-House.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
