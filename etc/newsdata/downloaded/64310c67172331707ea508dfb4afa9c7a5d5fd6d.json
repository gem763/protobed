It\u2019s also inevitable that if there is a baby on my flight, it will be seated within a couple of metres of me.\n\nAnd that\u2019s fine! Babies have to fly too. I imagine parents travelling with babies have enough to worry about without arseholes giving them stink-eyes. So I just accept whatever damage is happening to my eardrums.\n\nBut if I ever fly Japan Airlines (JAL) or All Nippon Airways, I can counteract fate and book a seat that isn\u2019t near a toddler.\n\nJAL recently announced it now uses a booking tool that displays where children aged two and younger are sitting. The Guardian reports that All Nippon Airways has already had this feature.\n\nThank you, @JAL_Official_jp for warnings me about where babies plan to scream and yell during a 13 hour trip. This really ought to be mandatory across the board. Please take note, @qatarairways: I had 3 screaming babies next to me on my JFK-DOH flight two weeks ago. pic.twitter.com/kQYQFIqqCD \u2014 Rahat Ahmed (@dequinix) September 24, 2019\n\nThe feature may not work if parents book through third-party services. JAL notes on its site the baby icons might not show a flight is changed right before departure.\n\nHopefully, airlines in the West will start adopting this tool. Though I imagine if this catches on, carriers will use it as a way to charge more for certain seats.", "description": "At least two airlines have adopted the brilliant idea of allowing passengers to try to sit as far away as possible from auditory powder kegs \u2014 babies on aeroplanes....", "authors": ["James Whitbrook", "Elizabeth Blackstock"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/zgi2gcbk35kc6a7sqa0s.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
