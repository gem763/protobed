The authorities' cruel treatment adds to their suffering and victimizes them further,\" he said.\n\nBecker conceded the country was facing \"formidable challenges from the Boko Haram insurgency, but detaining thousands of children is not the answer\".\n\nHe said children affected by the conflict need rehabilitation and schooling, not prison.\n\nThe decade-long insurgency in northeast Nigeria by Boko Haram has killed more than 27 000 people, displaced some two million, and spilt over into neighbouring countries, sparking a dire humanitarian crisis in the region.\n\nSign UN protocol\n\nHRW asked the Nigerian government to sign a UN protocol that would ensure the transfer of the affected children to child protection authorities for rehabilitation, family reunification, and community reintegration.\n\n\"If military or intelligence authorities have credible evidence of criminal offences by children, they should transfer them to civilian judicial authorities to be treated in accordance with national and international juvenile justice standards,\" it said.\n\nIt said that in June it interviewed 32 children detained at Giwa barracks who said they were not taken to court, as required by law.\n\n\"None were aware of any charges against them. One was detained when he was only 5 years old,\" it said.\n\nIt said the children were arrested during military operations, security sweeps, screening procedures for internally displaced people, and based on information from informants.\n\n\"Many of the children said they were arrested after fleeing Boko Haram attacks on their village or while seeking refuge at camps for internally displaced people,\" it added.\n\n\"One said he was arrested and detained for more than two years for allegedly selling yams to Boko Haram members,\" it said, adding that several abducted girls were also forced to marry Boko Haram fighters.\n\n\"Approximately one-third of the children interviewed said security forces beat them during interrogation after their arrest at Giwa barracks.\n\nOne girl who was forced to marry a Boko Haram member, said that after soldiers captured her, \"the soldiers were beating us with their belts, calling us names and telling us they will deal with us because we are Boko Haram wives\".\n\nOthers said they were beaten if they denied association with Boko Haram, the report said.\n\nLocal and international rights bodies have accused Nigerian security forces of arbitrary arrests, detention and summary executions of Boko Haram suspects.\n\nThe security forces have repeatedly denied the charges.", "description": "Human Rights Watch urged Nigeria to release thousands of children detained by the military over suspected links with Boko Haram.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9338/368b1759368d4147b8dad8b5641e07bd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
