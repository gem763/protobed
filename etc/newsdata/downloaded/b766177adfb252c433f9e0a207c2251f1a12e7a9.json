A team of federal officials visited Los Angeles Tuesday on a fact-finding mission, a spokesman for the administration said, a week before Mr. Trump visits the state on a fundraising trip.\n\n\u201cThe spike in homelessness we are seeing in places like L.A. and San Francisco is alarming,\u201d a spokesman for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. \u201cWhile there are many state and local issues at play here, we\u2019re looking at a range of options available to us at HUD\u2014as well as other agencies\u2014for possible federal action, if and where appropriate,\u201d a spokeswoman said.\n\nThe administration didn\u2019t make clear what types of action it is considering. Nor is it clear what type of measures the administration legally can take.\n\nAlex Comisar, a spokesman for Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, a Democrat, said the mayor\u2019s office hosted the delegation of federal officials in an attempt to show them \u201cour work to confront this humanitarian emergency.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe learned very recently of their plans to learn about our strategies,\u201d Mr. Comisar said. \u201cWe welcomed them.\u201d\n\nThe homeless population has risen this year in major California cities despite efforts by local and state governments to deploy billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded efforts. California hasn\u2019t built enough apartments and homes to keep up with population growth, and many critics say regulations should be eased to spur construction. Paying for outreach programs and new affordable housing simply isn\u2019t enough to match decades of underbuilding, they argue.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a state budget in June investing $1.75 billion in efforts to spur new housing and about $1 billion aimed at helping cities and counties combat homelessness.\n\nHomelessness jumped 12% and 16% from a year ago in the county and city of Los Angeles, respectively, according to figures released this summer based on a count conducted in January. Other localities in California saw substantial increases compared with 2017, when they last conducted a count. In San Francisco, the number rose 17%, while Alameda County, which includes Oakland, saw a 43% increase.\n\nBoth Los Angeles and San Francisco have struggled with efforts to build housing for the homeless, with residents objecting to facilities being built in their neighborhoods. San Francisco Mayor London Breed blamed part of the problem on a decline in federal resources.\n\n\u201cWe need federal support and resources to build more housing for people living on our streets,\u201d she said. \u201cBut simply cracking down on homelessness without providing the housing that people need is not a real solution and will likely only make the situation worse.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to the White House, Mr. Garcetti asked Mr. Trump to step up funding for affordable housing, mental-health programs and the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nMr. Deere noted that the president signed an executive order aimed at affordable housing in June and said he has asked aides to \u201cdevelop a range of policy options for consideration to deal with this tragedy.\u201d Mr. Trump has suggested that California policies are to blame for the crisis, in keeping with his broader clash with Democratic leaders in the state on issues such as immigration and climate change.\n\nIn an interview Tuesday before Mr. Trump\u2019s administration announced its plans, Mr. Newsom rejected criticism that California\u2019s policies were the cause of homelessness.\n\n\u201cPeople are right to criticize the homeless crisis in the state, it\u2019s unacceptable. They\u2019re right to criticize the affordability issue, it is unacceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m deeply searching for strategies and solutions\u2026for our critics, please offer constructive criticism as opposed to ideological critique.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump will make a swing through California Sept. 17-18, with donor events scheduled in the Bay Area, Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, and San Diego. The White House hasn\u2019t announced any nonpolitical events during the trip.\n\n\u2014Alex Leary and Catherine Lucey contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Alejandro Lazo at alejandro.lazo@wsj.com", "description": "The Trump administration said it may try to help get homeless people in California off the streets, a move that followed earlier criticism of the state\u2019s cities for their handling of the growing problem.", "authors": ["Alejandro Lazo", "Alejandro.Lazo Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105959/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
