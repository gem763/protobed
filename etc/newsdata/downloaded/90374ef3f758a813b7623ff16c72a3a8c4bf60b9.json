So I will keep you all posted.\n\nShe also made mention of the trolls who sent her death threats after Dev Griffin and Dianne Buswell were axed from the show, contrasting them with the positive messages she's received from fans wishing her well in the hospital.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nShirley added: \"I just really want to thank all the positive people that direct messaged me to wish me luck, such beautiful messages.\n\n\"I know in this world we live in people go off on one and don't really think often before they speak. On Twitter , to do with this and that.\n\n\"But to receive so many beautiful messages was really touching. So thank you everybody, and I will be keeping you posted.\"\n\n(Image: Mike Marsland/WireImage)\n\nEarlier in the night, Shirley addressed her legions of fans: \"We're getting ready for Pride of Britain, and we'll be leaving in a little while and returning early to get ready for tomorrow morning's surgery.\n\n\"Other than that, all's good and sending everybody a hug.\"\n\nShirley isn't the only Strictly star to ditch the implants - leader board-topping Michelle Visage got rid of hers recently and has since seen an improvement in her neurological condition.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nChatting with Lorraine Kelly yesterday morning, Michelle revealed that rigorously training with pro partner Giovanni Pernice has helped the healing process.\n\n\"When I took control of my health by removing my breast implants,\" Michelle said, \"I started to feel better and thought, 'What better way to have a second chance at life than Strictly?'\n\n\"It took a good six weeks for me to get on my feet to the point where I thought, 'How am I going to be able to dacne, I can't even got to the ladies' room by myself.'\n\n\"Each time I sweat, each time I'm pushing through an eight-hour rehearsal, I'm thinking, 'I'm healing, I'm healing, I'm healing,' and that's what pushes it through.\"\n\nThe Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Awards, in partnership with TSB, will broadcast on ITV on 5th November at 8pm.", "description": "Shirley told he Instagram followers that she would be heading home early from last night's Pride of Britain Awards so she's well rested for today's surgery", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Instagram", "Mike Marsland Wireimage", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20748965.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Pride-Of-Britain-Awards-2019-Red-Carpet-Arrivals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
