She may have a stack of receipts to claim on expenses. A credit card for collecting air miles. Building entry passes, an Oyster card, a driving license, and let\u2019s not forget loyalty cards for coffee shops and nail bars.\n\nBut as we move towards an increasingly cashless society, is the coin pocket redundant? Do we even need a sleeve for bank notes? And aren\u2019t most receipts digital now? How we organise this facet of our lives is important.\n\nWe tested a range of women\u2019s wallets to find the best around, getting some very very strange looks in the process as we stuffed our own cards, receipts, loose change and even phones into the seemingly endless options in stores.\n\nWe worked to a strict criteria: would it survive being knocked about in a handbag? How many cards fit into each slot? Is the lining going to tear? Here are the carriers that made the cut.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

There are a mammoth 12 card slots, a zipped coin pocket and additional slots roomy enough to hold an iPhone. Plus 50 per cent of the brand\u2019s profits go to charity.\n\nBuy now\n\nComme des Garcons super fluorescent half-zip leather wallet: \u00a370, Selfridges\n\nThis looks a little like one of those books of fluorescent Post-It notes, in a good way because Day-Glo hues are a major fashion story. This versatile little wallet from cult Japanese brand Comme des Garcons packs a punch both in colour and performance. The orange interior section is a simple and effective way to organise cards, cash and receipts, while the half zip keeps the shape sleek and the contents safe.\n\nBuy now\n\nAccessorize leopard leather wallet: \u00a329, Accessorize\n\nIn our opinion, leopard is a neutral \u2013 it goes with almost everything, but especially black leather, the combination featured in this fold-out wallet from Accessorize. It\u2019s perfect for those with a lot of kit to carry with eight card slots, two zipped pockets and two further slots for notes, receipts and other paper paraphernalia. It\u2019s an affordable buy that will work as hard as you do.\n\nBuy now\n\nArket leather card holder: \u00a325, Arket\n\nFor those who prefer to travel light, or live a relatively cash-free life, a simple card holder is the perfect solution. Arket uses premium, naturally-tanned leather for this silver version, which has four card slots plus, critically, a central pocket for storing receipts, notes and the occasional coin.\n\nBuy now\n\nAnya Hindmarch patent leather wallet: \u00a3147, The Outnet\n\nHow cute is Anya Hindmarch\u2019s winky face motif? It\u2019s still a grown-up wallet though \u2013 the grande dame of handbags makes very good accessories and this roomy version has dedicated card slots and coin pockets, plus space for all the loyalty cards and other paraphernalia we accumulate. Typically they cost around \u00a3300, but this one is a relative bargain at 50 per cent off at The Outnet.\n\nBuy now\n\nChlo\u00e9 colour-block leather card holder: \u00a3160, Net-a-Porter\n\nYes, this is technically a card holder, but we couldn\u2019t resist: it is small but perfectly formed. The three complementary shades of leather and curved card slots make your essentials look like a work of art. The central pocket can be used for receipts and bills. It\u2019s expensive but a hero piece that won\u2019t date as quickly as more obvious designer buys.\n\nBuy now\n\nMango flamingo print cardholder: \u00a36.99, Mango\n\nThis is a great compromise between a card holder and a traditional wallet. The outer card pockets make bank cards and entry passes easy to tap, while the long zipped section can hold money and receipts. The flamingo print faux leather is fun without being twee, and the price makes it a total bargain.\n\nBuy now\n\nUterque crocodile print wallet: \u00a369, Uterque\n\nZara\u2019s under-the-radar sister brand is a favourite with Spanish women for beautiful clothes and accessories that you won\u2019t see on anyone else. This midi-size purse is an elegant greenish brown that looks rather expensive in croc-embossed leather. The cotton-lined interior opens like a book to reveal seven card slots, a zipped section and a compartment for notes.\n\nBuy now\n\nHerschel tyler wallet in \u2018ash rose\u2019: \u00a325, Herschel\n\nHerschel is about more than just backpacks. This small but mighty purse can accommodate plenty of cards even though there are just two inside slots, as well as coins and cash, plus it has an radio-frequency identification (RFID) blocking layer for those worried about data being skimmed from cards with the relevant chips. We love the contrasting striped lining and useful outer card sleeve too.\n\nBuy now\n\nBellroy pocket: \u00a365, Bellroy\n\nThe simple moniker of Bellroy\u2019s mid-size purse belies its clever design. The central divider floats so you can arrange the interior in a way that suits you, plus it can even fit a small iPhone. The leather is of beautiful quality and the sunny lemon yellow is a colour that makes us smile, plus it comes with a three-year warranty.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Women\u2019s wallets and purses\n\nIronically, you get what you pay for with wallets. There\u2019s no reason not to go for a budget buy that suits your style and needs, but the more high-end pieces tend to be more intelligently designed and better made. Elvis & Kresse\u2019s roomy wallet ticked all the boxes in terms of style, craftsmanship, sustainability and values, and for that reason it\u2019s our winner.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
