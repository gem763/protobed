The three nations also said they\u2019ll try to deter people from other countries who want to cross their territory en route to the U.S.\n\nFor example, under a deal with Guatemala, migrants from further south who traverse Guatemala and eventually reach the U.S. to claim asylum could be sent back to Guatemala to make their asylum claims there.\n\nThe theory, U.S. officials say, is that Guatemala is a safe country so legitimate asylum-seekers fleeing from other countries can find safety there. If they continue on to the U.S., it\u2019s an indication they are regular illegal migrants rather than bona fide asylum-seekers, the administration says.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reported that the new decision Wednesday will apply to about $150 million, or a third of the money that was cut off earlier this year.\n\nDemocrats said the springtime decision to halt funding was \u201ccounterproductive,\u201d wounding America\u2019s standing with the Central American countries and creating an opening for China and Russia to try to win influence in the region.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why there has been a complete bipartisan rejection of this effort,\u201d said Rep. Eliot Engel, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nHe said he will battle the administration to release all of the money that was halted.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
