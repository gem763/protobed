The company also faces a $3 billion fine in the United States for illegally marketing Suboxone.\n\nOn Tuesday, Indivior said it intends to cease production of its authorised Suboxone generic to cut losses from a change in rebating policy in the United States and instead focus on its newer injectable treatment, Sublocade.\n\nThe drugmaker reported revenue of over $1 billion last year - generated largely from the United States and from sales of Suboxone.\n\nIndivior now expects full-year net revenue to be in the range of $750 million to $790 million, compared with the prior forecast of $670 million to $720 million. It also expects to report higher profit than the prior expectation.\n\nThe company tightened its forecast for Sublocade revenue to be between $60 million and $70 million.\n\nShares in Indivior were up 12.4% at 55.5 pence as of 0723 GMT.\n\n(Reporting by Aakash Jagadeesh Babu and Pushkala Aripaka in Bengaluru; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu)", "description": "(Reuters) - Indivior Plc on Tuesday raised its full-year forecasts  as the embattled British drugmaker's best-selling opioid addiction drug Suboxone fared better than expected in the face of competition from copycats.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
