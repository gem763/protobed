Well, they have been for a while. And now it just makes matters worse.\u201d\n\nThe comments come days after Ms Pelosi, who had previously resisted calls for impeachment, announced that the House would now start impeachment proceedings against Mr Trump.\n\nHer decision was sparked by a whistleblower complaint regarding a July phone call between Mr Trump and Mr Zelensky, in which the president asked the Ukrainian to investigate Mr Biden \u2014 a potential 2020 rival \u2014 as a \u201cfavour\u201d, after discussing aid to the former Soviet country.\n\nThose allegations have been corroborated by a rough transcript of the phone call, which the White House released earlier this week.\n\nDemocrats now appear to be moving quickly on impeachment, saying that they will focus tightly on the Ukrainian issue, in spite of other concerns that have been raised during Mr Trump\u2019s nearly three-year presidency.\n\nThe House intelligence committee is leading the charge, with representative Adam Schiff, the committee\u2019s chairman, saying on Thursday that the whistleblower complaint provided a clear \u201croad map\u201d for investigators in the coming weeks. He also said that the committee would work through a two-week recess that is slated to start on Friday.\n\nEarly indications suggest that articles of impeachment may be filed by the end of October.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump rants nonsensically about his own spelling mistake\n\nTrump lashes out at 'spies' behind Ukraine complaint\n\nRudy Giuliani furiously defends involvement in Ukraine scandal", "description": "Just days after announcing a formal impeachment inquiry, Nancy Pelosi says that attorney general William Barr has \u201cgone rogue\u201d to protect Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.Ms Pelosi, the speaker of the House and the highest ranking Democrat in Congress, made the accusation during an appearance on MSNBC\u2019s Morning", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2HlcZ5mwnX42nPFTchy7yg--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/45e9a04249b8344bafd91496d1dd9155", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
