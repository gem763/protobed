They favoured the centre-left SLD/Lewica and the right-wing to far-right KON (NI) more than the average voter. #wybory2019 #wybory pic.twitter.com/401uiD1878 \u2014 Europe Elects (@EuropeElects) October 13, 2019\n\nWhile Poland has enjoyed strong growth under Law and Justice and become the first post-communist state to achieve \u201cdeveloped market\u201d status, party lawmaker Dominik Tarczy\u0144ski told Breitbart News that it had not followed the traditional \u201cit\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d strategy in its election campaign, preferring to focus on \u201cidentity\u201d and \u201csafety\u201d \u2014 particulary with respect to border security and the migrant crisis, which may be set to reintensify.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want Poland to be just a piece of land. We don\u2019t want any other country to be just a piece of land, and a mark on the map,\u201d Tarczy\u0144ski said, defending the party\u2019s decision to increase support for mothers and eliminate income tax for young people rather than pursue economic growth via mass migration.\n\n\u201cPoland is much more than land itself. Poland is us. We are Poland, and we have to cherish it, we have to fight for it, we have to care about it, we have to think about the future,\u201d he insisted.\n\nEXCLUSIVE \u2013 It\u2019s Not (Just) the Economy, Stupid: Poland MP Says Elections Are About \u2018Identity, Safety\u2019 https://t.co/50YxejW1bq \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 13, 2019\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "description": "Poland's Law and Justice Party (PiS) increased its vote share in national elections, despite being hounded by the EU and the global left.", "authors": ["Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Poland-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
