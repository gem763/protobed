What I would say is that the younger kids could practise technique with a soft plastic ball.\n\n'One of the biggest problems they had in days gone by was that there was a lot of practice heading sessions.'\n\nHowever, he added: 'I don't believe it should be taken out of the game. I think it's very much part of the game, like tackling.\n\n'It's a special aspect of it and I want to keep that in football but we should take into account the danger for kids.'\n\nHenry McLeish, who played for East Fife, and now chairs the elite academy in the area, said he endorsed Gordon Smith's view about children heading balls.\n\nThe Jeff Astle gates outside West Brom's Hawthorns stadium: Astle died from dementia, a disease that was ruled to have been caused by repetitively heading leather footballs\n\nHe said: 'If there are risks then we need to discuss them in an informed, open and constructive manner.'\n\nFormer England midfielder Ryan Mason previously called for children to be banned from heading balls to prevent them suffering brain injuries.\n\nThe player's career was cut short at the age of 26 after he fractured his skull in a clash with another player.\n\nThe landmark dementia study, of 7,680 Scottish professionals born between 1900 and 1976, was published in the respected New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe FA-funded research found ex-players were five times as likely to have died with Alzheimer\u2019s - the most common form of dementia - than the general population.\n\nThe research also found footballers had a four-fold increased risk of dying of motor neurone disease and a two-fold increase for Parkinson\u2019s.\n\nOther experts pointed out the players assessed used much heavier footballers than in the modern game, so the risks may not be as great as the study suggests.\n\nResponding to the University of Glasgow study, FA chairman Greg Clarke said there are 'many questions that still need to be answered'.\n\nThe study was launched after years of campaigning by the family of former West Brom and England star Jeff Astle, who died aged of 59 with severe brain damage.\n\nAstle, who was known as a great header of the ball, died in 2002 after a career in which he scored 174 goals in 361 games.\n\nHis inquest heard his neurological disorder - chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) - had been caused by the repeated impact of heading footballs.\n\nThe progressive, degenerative brain disease is often found in individuals with a history of head injury, such as professional boxers and American footballers.\n\nDr James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, said the study does not say 'anything about the risk of a Saturday kick about in the park'.\n\nAlan Shearer (pictured) underwent tests on his brain as part of a documentary on the risks of dementia associated with the long-term effects of heading footballs back in 2017", "description": "Ex-Rangers player Gordon Smith wants youngsters to practice with soft plastic balls.
