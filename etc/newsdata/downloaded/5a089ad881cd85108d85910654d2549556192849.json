She had never revealed the recipe to anyone, which strained some friendships.\n\nThe day I learned to make chicken relleno, my lola laid out two cutting boards and a set of battered but carefully sharpened knives. Wearing a shower cap over her head, she deboned the chicken with her tiny hands so fast, I had to double-check what parts were left. Her embutido \u2014 the pork and sausage stuffing to be sewn up inside the chicken \u2014 required the technical precision of a French farce (finely pur\u00e9ed meat) . Later, at a culinary conference, I watched a demonstration by the French chef Jacques P\u00e9pin and realized that my lola was making galantine .\n\nThat was the first time I took a real look at the mechanics behind the food of my childhood. My mom emailed me her recipe archive , a 40-page document that included multiple takes on single dishes, culled from her sisters and my lola. Not all of them were complete or correct as written \u2014 certain ingredients and methods simply went unmentioned, taken for granted, part of the heritage of life in the Philippines, where those details would\u2019ve been communal knowledge.\n\nWhen The Times asked me for 10 recipes that speak to the heart of Filipino cuisine, I went back through my mom\u2019s collection and consulted old cookbooks drawing from other regions of the Philippines. Like generations of Filipino cooks before me, I\u2019ve adapted these recipes to my taste, knowing that not everyone may approve. My lola looked slightly askance at the chicken relleno I made for Mission Chinese Food \u2014 but she was tickled that I called it Josefina\u2019s House Special Chicken and sold it for $75.\n\nThere sadly isn\u2019t room here to include some of my favorite comfort foods, like monggo, a mung-bean stew lush with melted pork fat, or the deep-fried meatballs called bola-bola that I used to make for my roommates when I was nostalgic for home. Truly, this list is just a beginning, for me as much as for you: The Philippines is an archipelago of more than 7,600 islands, and each region has a claim to culinary glory.\n\nIt might surprise you how familiar some of the ingredients are. Filipino food is a centuries-long tangle of Eastern and Western traditions, from early exchanges with Chinese traders to the reign of the Spanish conquistadors. Given our colonial past, we share as much culinary kinship with Latin America as with our Southeast Asian neighbors. Butter and cheese are happily and amply applied. So is ketchup, although we add our own twist: bananas. (It\u2019s magic.)\n\nMy parents\u2019 story, like that of many Filipino immigrants, also unites East and West. My dad is from Batangas, but my mom met him halfway across the world, in the Netherlands, where she was on tour with the Filipino national folk dance troupe . He\u2019d hitchhiked across Europe and ended up a pageboy at the Philippine Embassy at The Hague .", "description": "The creative director for food and culture at the Standard hotels and former Mission Chinese Food chef chooses the dishes that define the cuisine for her.", "authors": ["Angela Dimayuga", "Ligaya Mishan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/dining/08Filipino14/08Filipino14-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
