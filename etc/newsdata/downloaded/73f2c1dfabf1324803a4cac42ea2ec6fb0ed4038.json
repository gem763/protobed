These recommendations are usually risk/reward commodities meant to be used in large-field tournaments. Typically, blending these low-owned hidden gems with well-aligned staples contributes to a viable GPP strategy.\n\nKeep in mind that the following player write-ups were constructed earlier in the day, and sometimes injury/rest situations can alter the fantasy landscape. Monitoring our MLB News & Headlines Feed throughout the day will keep you in the loop while giving you the subsequent DFS consequences of each information piece.\n\nWe will be looking at the 12-game main slate beginning at 7:05 ET.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPITCHER\n\nSandy Alcantara - Miami (at Pittsburgh)\n\nAlcantara hasn\u2019t been as sharp through the second half of the season, but he\u2019s beginning to right the ship with three quality starts over his last four outings. The Miami righty is a sleeper candidate to post a respectable fantasy return on his bargain-basement salary within tonight\u2019s slate. The matchup at Pittsburgh looks encouraging, as the Pirates rank below average in most major hitting categories. The pitcher-friendly atmosphere of PNC Park doesn\u2019t hurt either.\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nMiguel Cabrera - Detroit (at Kansas City)\n\nA good share of DFS enthusiasts will consider Kansas City LHP Mike Montgomery against this lowly Tigers\u2019 offense. However, we can\u2019t forget about Cabrera, who is swinging a confident bat with five hits, one homer, three runs, and two RBIs over his past three games. The future Hall-of-Famer could jump on the platoon advantage in this battle of veteran players.\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nGavin Lux - LA Dodgers (vs. Colorado)\n\nStory continues\n\nLux made quite the impression in his major league debut yesterday, going 2-5 with a double and three runs. He could rack up more production tonight, assuming he\u2019s granted another start. The matchup looks great against Colorado RHP Chi Chi Gonzalez, who carries a vulnerable .441 wOBA split to left-handed bats. The rookie\u2019s near-minimum salary blends very favorably into all lineup formats as well.\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nKyle Seager - Seattle (at Chicago Cubs)\n\nMost people will shy away from the lefty/lefty matchup here, but Cubs\u2019 LHP Jon Lester owns an inflated .359 wOBA split to left-handed bats over the past two seasons. Seager has a strong history against the Chicago southpaw, making him an interesting GPP Pivot away from the popular third baseman. Seager has been a fantasy beast over the past month, and he certainly carries a fair amount of upside in his back pocket.\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nAdalberto Mondesi - Kansas City (vs. Detroit)\n\nI\u2019m hoping most people forgot about this guy, as Mondesi has been on the shelf since July 16. He made his return yesterday with a sweet 4-5 showing with two runs and three steals. Mondesi can contribute in every category (hits, homers, runs, RBIs, steals), presenting massive fantasy upside on any given night. The matchup is definitely favorable against Detroit LHP Daniel Norris and a patchwork Tigers\u2019 bullpen.\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nKhris Davis - Oakland (vs. LA Angels)\n\nDavis is having a down season, and most people have probably written him off for fantasy purposes. However, I\u2019m viewing this as a nice buy-low opportunity for the Oakland slugger, as he\u2019ll step into a promising draw against Angels\u2019 RHP Jaime Barria\u2019s .372 wOBA split to right-handed bats. He came back nicely from a small break (paternity leave) with a 2-3 performance yesterday in New York. Perhaps some of that momentum will carry into this favorable matchup.\n\nTommy Edman - St. Louis (vs. San Francisco)\n\nEdman is no stranger to this column, and I really like him as a sleeper outfielder tonight. San Francisco RHP Dereck Rodriguez has really struggled lately, allowing 11 earned runs and 14 hits through nine innings over his last two starts. There\u2019s a good chance those problems will persist while facing a red-hot St. Louis team on the road. The rookie switch-hitter, Edman, is an affordable option within that. There\u2019s certainly upside in his profile after registering a trio of three-hit performances over his last eight games.", "description": "Spencer Limbach finds some sneaky-good MLB GPP Pivots away from the popular picks for Tuesday, September 3.
