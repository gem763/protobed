Shout out Laura: I\u2019m on The View and you\u2019re not!\u201d\n\nIn March 2009, Ingraham took to her radio show to take a personal dig at McCain. After McCain had appeared on MSNBC\u2019s The Rachel Maddow Show to bemoan extreme partisanship, Ingraham employed a stereotypical Valley Girl-like voice to ridicule McCain.\n\n\u201cI was really hoping that I was going to get that role in the Real World, but then I realized that, well, they don\u2019t like plus-sized models,\u201d Ingraham said. \u201cThey only like the women who look a certain way.\u201d\n\nMcCain would later respond to Ingraham\u2019s remarks by saying \u201ckiss my fat ass.\u201d Somewhat ironically, following these comments a decade ago, both Ingraham and McCain would later become colleagues at Fox News.\n\nThe conservative View host would go on to point out that she\u2019s \u201cfat-shamed every day\u201d as critics are constantly telling her she\u2019s too fat to be on The View before dinging Maher for not understanding all the issues surrounding obesity.\n\n\u201cI think we need to have compassion towards people who are struggling in life in general, and as you said, so much about obesity in this country is about poverty and access to health care,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cBut I\u2019m conflicted because I wouldn\u2019t have met my husband if he weren\u2019t a guest on Bill Maher, so I always have a tiny little place in my heart for Bill Maher.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI want to say if I weren\u2019t fat-shamed, I wouldn\u2019t have a career,\u201d she declared. \u201cLaura Ingraham said I was too \u2018plus-sized\u2019 to be on TV.\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568650679/view_61_rih8p4", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
