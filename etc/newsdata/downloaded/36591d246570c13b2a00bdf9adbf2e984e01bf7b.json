The province\u2019s credit rating is lower than Quebec, Nova Scotia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia, noted the annual report by the office, which provides independent analysis of the province\u2019s finances and trends in its economy.\n\n\u201cOntario\u2019s economic outlook has weakened over the past year, leading to lower expectations for revenue growth,\u201d the FAO said. \u201cThe province\u2019s credit rating would face downward pressure if economic growth was weaker than expected.\u201d\n\nBudget deficits every year since 2008-09 with continued projected deficits until 2022-23 add risk to the outlooks by ratings companies along with challenges for spending targets because of population growth and previous fiscal constraint, the FAO said.\n\nAn economic downturn or a significant departure from current spending plans could lead to a deterioration in Ontario\u2019s credit health\n\nThere are also structural barriers to Ontario\u2019s revenue growth such as heavily indebted households and an uncertain trade and investment climate that could limit the government\u2019s flexibility on tax policies, according to the report.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s budget plan depends heavily on sustained economic growth and success in limiting spending,\u201d the FAO said. \u201cAn economic downturn or a significant departure from current spending plans could lead to a deterioration in Ontario\u2019s credit health.\u201d\n\nIt referred to how in December, Moody\u2019s had downgraded its credit rating to AA-, the fourth highest investment grade level, from AA and revised its outlook to stable from negative. Fitch Ratings Co. kept its AA- rating and also upgraded its outlook to stable from negative.\n\nDBRS has the same rating and outlook while Standard & Poor\u2019s has an A+ rating, the fifth highest investment grade level, and a stable outlook.\n\nThe province has benefitted from low interest rates as the Bank of Canada has stalled on increases this year to leave the benchmark rate at 1.75 per cent, partially easing pressure on loan repayments by Queen\u2019s Park.\n\n\u201cHowever, there is the risk that large borrowing requirements in the next few years combined with a steeper-than-expected increase in interest rates could accelerate the accumulation in debt and put downward pressure on the province\u2019s credit rating,\u201d the FAO said.\n\n\u2022 Email: cmcclelland@postmedia.com", "description": "Net debt stands at $338 billion for fiscal 2018-19, the most debt for a sub-national borrower in the world", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ford.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
