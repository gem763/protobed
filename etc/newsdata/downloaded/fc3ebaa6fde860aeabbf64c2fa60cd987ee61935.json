Our goal is a tournament victory,\" said Satoshi Sekihata, 33, a dentist from Chiba prefecture, who played rugby in college.\n\nAt the Tokyo fanzone, supporters erupted in thunderous roars every time the Japanese players threatened the Springbok line -- mirroring the tens of thousands of Brave Blossom fans at Tokyo Stadium.\n\nSpectators stood on tip-toe to catch a glimpse of the giant screens and even those who could barely see a thing were belting out loud cheers anyway.\n\n\"I cannot believe how the whole of Japan has gone rugby-mad,\" said Takuya Okumura, a 30-year-old businessman who lives in Brazil but was on a business trip to his home land this month.\n\n\"It's like football. If the national team does well, then fans follow,\" he said.\n\n\"Tokyo will host the summer Olympics next year. Maybe this is an opportunity for the popularity of rugby to rise.\"\n\nWorld Rugby brought the tournament to Japan -- the first time the global showcase has featured in Asia -- to tap into a new audience and some education has definitely been required in the finer points of the game.\n\nEver since the tournament started, national television networks have aired special programmes to explain the rules, techniques and strategies of rugby.\n\nNewspapers have used elaborate graphics to do the same, with top selling daily Yomiuri Shimbun using its Sunday morning edition to warn the Brave Blossoms about \"kicks to the heavens\", referring to South African scrumhalf Faf de Klerk's high box kicks.\n\nThe Nikkei business daily warned readers ahead of the game that the Springboks have their guards high \"unlike the last tournament\" four years ago when Japan famously upset the two-time champions.\n\nPhrasing it in a way Japanese readers can relate to, the paper said: \"It will be like an enormous yokozuna (sumo grand champion) charging head-on,\" the paper said.\n\nThis turned out to be a fair analogy as some of the hits the Springboks put on their Japanese counterparts must have felt like a sumo clash.\n\nMany fans were keen to look to the future and Rintaro Watanabe, an 18-year-old who plays on the wing for his high-school team, said Japan's historic run should encourage more young athletes to try the sport.\n\n\"With the new-found popularity, we will see more children playing rugby,\" he predicted.\n\nSouth Africa coach Rassie Erasmus was quick to pay tribute to the Japanese team and the fans, saying they should be proud of the way they have hosted the 2019 World Cup.\n\nAnd they seem to have made some fans even among opposition supporters.\n\n\"They (Japan) are a force to be reckoned with,\" said South African native Michael Raats, 33, adding that Japan seemed to have got better as the tournament progressed.", "description": "Japan's rugby fans had nothing but praise for their team's fairytale march to the World Cup quarter-finals that came crashing down with a 26-3 defeat to South Africa.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9491/11b5bef1b759442587bc25f7869b81b9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
