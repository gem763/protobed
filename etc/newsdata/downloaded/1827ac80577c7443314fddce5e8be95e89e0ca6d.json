REUTERS/Rodi Said/File Photo\n\n\u201cWe feel betrayed, we feel angry,\u201d said Antar, a 26-year-old student, during at a meeting to plan a Saturday rally in New York City decrying Turkey\u2019s strikes, which sparked international criticism and fears of a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nTurkey attacked after U.S. President Donald Trump decided to withdraw U.S. troops who had been fighting alongside Kurdish forces against Islamic State militants.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been helping the U.S. Like, 11,000 people died for this,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it because I\u2019m Kurd that I have to be killed?\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau has estimated there are about 21,000 people of Kurdish ancestry in America. Hundreds on Friday protested in front of the federal courthouse in Nashville, home to the largest U.S. concentration of Kurds.\n\nKurdish-American demonstrators carried signs with messages including \u201cU.S. protect us. Stand by your word\u201d and \u201cIf you don\u2019t want refugees, stop creating them.\u201d More rallies were planned in the coming days in New York, Washington and Dallas.\n\nKurds have long played a role in U.S. military action in the Middle East, from the first Gulf War in the early 1990s to the latest fights against Islamic State militants.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to just let this go in silence,\u201d said Jotyar Hussein, a 34-year-old construction worker that attended the rally with his 5-year-old son. \u201cWe stand side-by-side with the U.S. Army and fight the ISIS. They do air, we do the ground. We both do our job. Now this is what the Kurdish people get as a reward?\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump all of a sudden forgot that Kurds were fighting shoulder-and-shoulder with American soldiers,\u201d said Tabeer Sindi, 34, secretary of the Tennessee Kurdish Community Council in Nashville and a rally organizer.\n\n\u201cKurds were the only main force on the ground, the only boots on the ground. We sacrificed thousands of lives.\u201d\n\nSindi, a married father of four boys whose family came from northern Iraq 24 years ago, said his father, Ismail, was a Peshmarga commander killed in a mustard gas attack while fighting Saddam Hussein\u2019s forces in 1988.\n\nEven some of Trump\u2019s closest allies blasted the move, announced on Sunday. Twenty-nine of his fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives on Thursday said they would announce sanctions against Turkey over the attacks, a day after similar legislation was announced in the Senate.\n\n\u2018STAND BY YOUR WORD\u2019\n\nSindi said people in Nashville\u2019s Kurdish community have been getting news from Syria through social media and media outlets but also personal contacts and family members.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of Trump supporters in our community, but even they are mad. They are unhappy about this decision,\u201d Sindi said, adding that he also blames Congress and other U.S. allies for allowing the attack to begin.\n\n\u201cWhere are all the other countries? The whole world has been silent about this.\u201d\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said the purpose of the assault is to defeat the Kurdish YPG militia which has links to insurgents in Turkey.\n\nKurdish activists in the United States said they planned to call congressional representatives.\n\n\u201cI hear the senators \u2014 Republican and Democrats \u2014 talking about sanctions, but that that\u2019s not going to stop Erdogan,\u201d said Shyar Antar, a 24-year-old cousin of Lava Antar, from Qamishli City in northeast Syria, at the same New York meeting.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump should send back the troops to the border so that Turkey would stop the bombing. But I don\u2019t think after what has happened that Trump will go back,\u201d Antar said. \u201cSo I think right now the only hope is in Congress, try and implement a no fly zone.\u201d", "description": "Like many Kurds living in the United States, Lava Antar has had a hard time sleeping this week, waking often to check reports of Turkish jets and artillery pounding her northeast Syria homeland and learning her former neighbor's 30-year-old son was killed.", "authors": ["Tim Ghianni", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439862017&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A27P", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
