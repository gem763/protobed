But the dollar demand from importers and oil refiners at the firmer levels of the rupee lifted the currency to trade lower and ending the day at 70.85. It seems quite possible for the rupee to test the stiff resistance at 70.50 but the breach of that level may remain unsustainable. A successful breach of 70.50 level, quite unexpected as of now, shall take the rupee higher to test the 69.80 level. At close to 70.60 level, we strongly advise the importers to hedge their month-wise payables up to 3-month maturities and the average forward cover rate will be lower than the 71 levels.\n\nThe posted a huge gain of 582 points (1.48% gain) in line with other Asian markets as optimism for a US-China trade deal and hopes of fresh policy stimulus from the Federal Reserve, buoyed market sentiment. The stock market is expecting the existing structure of LTCG, STT and DTT will be reviewed by the Government and shall take more steps to cheer markets by announcing huge tax cuts. If the tax cuts materialize, the foreign investors\u2019 inflows shall significantly increase to take the BSE Sensex to a level higher than 41,000 points which could support the rupee to strengthen toward the 70.00 level.\n\nDue to the strengthening of rupee against the dollar and a rate cut of 25 bps anticipated from Fed in their FOMC meeting on Wednesday, the forwards drifted lower across the maturities. The paying interest in the market is significantly reduced and the receiving interest up to 6-month maturities was clearly seen in the swap market. This led to a sharp reduction in 3-month forward dollar premium to 3.52% per annum and the 6-month forward dollar premium drifted lower to trade at 3.98% per annum. If the rupee\u2019s stable trend continues in the 70.50-71.30 range, it is quite possible for the 6-month forward dollar premium to gradually drop to 3.75% per annum in the next 2 weeks timeframe. The RBI policy meeting on 5-12-19 is keenly awaited and if the outcome of the policy meeting results in a reduction in the repo rate to less than 5%, the forwards across all the maturities shall gain momentum to drift lower from the current levels.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Dipesh Gori covering: BSE Sensex 30.
