In the clip, the supermodel appears to trip over her partner\u2019s foot during a turn, sending her tumbling to the ground.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you what I see. I don\u2019t see a wrist and a shoulder being fractured. But that was real cute,\u201d Williams continued. \u201cHere\u2019s my thought: Dancing with the Stars called Christie Brinkley \u2026 and she said yes. After she got off the phone, that\u2019s when she plotted her schedule. \u2026 In my opinion, I think what Christie did was she signed up for Dancing with the Stars knowing that she\u2019d put her daughter Sailor in there.\u201d\n\nEXCLUSIVE ballroom bombshell! @SeaBrinkley is out of @DancingABC before the season begins. She tells @Ginger_Zee about her injury and the moment she called her daughter Sailor to ask her to step in for mom coming up on @GMA! #DWTS https://t.co/vCu1GI9DWR pic.twitter.com/SBDoWy84Aq \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) September 16, 2019\n\nRELATED: Christie Brinkley Is \u2018Devastated\u2019 over DWTS Injury but \u2018Excited\u2019 for Daughter Sailor to Compete\n\nBrinkley denied Williams\u2019 theory in an exclusive interview with PEOPLE. \u201cI\u2019m totally shocked, because I have been there for Wendy Williams. That is so weird,\u201d she said, bursting into tears. \u201cI have to give her a call \u2026 I\u2019m really stunned.\u201d\n\nIn a statement issued to GMA before Williams\u2019 remarks, Brinkley joked, \u201cShowbiz is all about getting a break, and Sailor and I both got one on Dancing with the Stars this season. Sailor joined the cast when I got mine \u2026 ouch somebody stop me, it hurts to laugh!\u201d\n\nBBC Studios and ABC said in a statement to PEOPLE that Brinkley \u201csuffered injuries which required surgery to her wrist and arm.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wish Christie a full and speedy recovery and look forward to seeing her in the audience, whenever possible, proudly supporting Sailor,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nSantiago Felipe/Getty; Sean Zanni/Patrick McMullan via Getty More\n\nWilliams \u2014 whose talk show has just been renewed though 2022 \u2014 speculated that Brinkley had faked the injury in order to get her 21-year-old daughter, who is also a model, cast on DWTS.\n\n\u201cNow, you know, Sailor is beautiful,\u201d Williams said. \u201cShe\u2019s a Sports Illustrated model, but that\u2019s not as big as being a Kendall Jenner. In order for girls to get this leg up, it takes more than beauty, you have to have cache. And that Dancing with the Stars has got a lot of eyeballs watching, and Christie really doesn\u2019t need that. You know who she is. She doesn\u2019t have to dance with the stars for you to know who she is. So my thought is that she said, \u2018Look, Sailor, here\u2019s what we we\u2019re going to do. I\u2019m going to go to a few of these practices, I\u2019m going to go on Good Morning America, get all the press and stuff, I\u2019m going to walk around looking hot and sexy, and then I\u2019m going to play like I broke something.\u2019 And she did break something, allegedly. Although Christie, I must tell you, there wasn\u2019t a believing person in my entire bureau meeting this morning.\u201d", "description": "Wendy Williams Thinks Christie Brinkley Faked Her DWTS Injury", "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/COc18h9QUBjHIH7yJNIi_w--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/ec650a2eff0636501952ac4f787602dd", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
