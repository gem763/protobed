They also set up places for tourists to enjoy local culture and purchase special local products.\n\nDuring the holiday, institutions in Chaozhou, including schools and government organs, provided 2,149 parking spaces.\n\nQuzhou also provided spaces for about 3,500 cars, which helped alleviate traffic pressure during the holiday, according to Beijing News.\n\nThe Yangzhou city government opened its internal parking lots and canteen for free during the three statutory holidays in China: Qingming Festival in April, May Day holiday in May and National Day holiday in October.\n\nMeng Qingguo, a professor at the School of Public Policy and Management at Tsinghua University, said that allowing the public to use government facilities is a critical manifestation of the openness of government services.\n\nHe said government departments should allow the public to make use of their resources as long as doing so does not have an impact on the operation of administrative organs.\n\nThe government is providing more services to society because of the improvements in high-quality development and openness in past years, he said.", "description": "An increasing number of government institutions are opening up their parking spaces and facilities free to tourists during holidays.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/10/5d9e7309a310cf3e97a05ed5.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
