But the dual role has rattled third-party sellers on its platform and drawn antitrust scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nOne of Amazon\u2019s businesses that regulators are looking into is the e-commerce giant's expanding private-label products, as third-party sellers \u2014 who are essentially business partners of Amazon's and generating over half of its sales \u2014 have long worried that Amazon uses their own sales data to compete against them. Two former employees at Amazon revealed to Yahoo Finance that the team used information from third-party sellers to develop Amazon private label products, including AmazonBasics, one of its most successful private labels. They also raised questions about Amazon\u2019s lax control over employees\u2019 access to marketplace data.\n\nThe former employees say the internal data are much more sophisticated than the information available in the public domain, or any third-party tools built for sellers. Employees can view aggregated data such as search interest and also pull reports from Amazon\u2019s data warehouse on specific products to help them decide what Amazon should make, according to those employees, who asked for anonymity because they have signed non-disclosure agreements or fear retribution from Amazon.\n\nBy putting search inquiries in the data warehouse, the employees said they were able to analyze various datasets from the marketplaces, including the list of top-selling and trending products in certain categories, pricing points, return data and reviews.\n\nAmazon Basics, a private label brand of Amazon providing low-cost, basic technology and other home products, has achieved major success.

They worked with the sourcing team, who are usually based in China, to find a manufacturer.\n\nIn a statement to Yahoo Finance, an Amazon spokesperson said the company has policies in place and specifically forbids employees from the above behavior. Amazon wouldn't confirm if employees who work on developing its private label products can look up third-party sellers\u2019 data. In June, Amazon's CEO Worldwide Consumer Jeff Wilke said the company doesn't allow anyone to have access to individual sellers\u2019 data in order to build a private-label product.\n\n\u201cWe train employees extensively on it, have technical controls in place, and audit compliance vigorously. Any employee in violation of this policy would face severe consequences,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nWilke also said the data Amazon uses is \u201cjust the best-seller list\u201d that is \u201cfairly available to anybody. So the things that we end up making in private labels are the things that sell the most that are at the top of search results,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a letter to the House Judiciary Committee in July, the company reiterated it prohibits the use of data related specifically to individual sellers in its private-label strategy. \u201cLike other retailers, we use aggregated store data (e.g., total sales) and customer shopping behavior (e.g., search volume) to identify the categories and products with high customer demand over a given time period,\u201d it wrote. Former employees said the use of data doesn\u2019t target individual sellers\u2014but they looked at specific products and categories.\n\n\u2018Free-for-all\u2019 access to data\n\nThe team at Amazon who works to develop private labels falls under the retail team, which is a separate department from Amazon Marketplace. Two teams operate individually, with different management and financial goals. But they share the same access to the data warehouse, which makes it possible for the retail team to use the data from marketplace sellers to develop private labels, according to former employees.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Former Amazon employees confirm third-party sellers' concern on how their data are used.
