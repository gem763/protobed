For us, really looking at what Elsa\u2019s journey is, it was her need to understand her powers.\u201d\n\nLee and Buck have said that two of the driving questions for \u201cFrozen 2\u201d were where did Elsa\u2019s powers come from, and why doesn\u2019t Anna have any?\n\nRead more: 3 unanswered questions from the first \u2018Frozen\u2019 movie the new sequel will address\n\n\u201cWe got a lot of feedback from each other while talking about [the story] and the pressure Elsa feels [as] a mythic character,\u201d Lee said. \u201cShe carries the weight of the world on her shoulders and that struggle of being pushed to her limit.\u201d\n\nElsa\u2019s bond with her sister Anna takes precedent over romance, and Lee says the queen isn\u2019t \u2018ready for relationships\u2019\n\ncaption Anna and Elsa\u2019s sisterhood was the love story of \u201cFrozen\u201d \u2014 not their romantic lives. source Walt Disney Animation Studios/YouTube\n\nThe first \u201cFrozen\u201d film was a subversion of Disney\u2019s previously typical \u201cgirl falls in love with prince and gets married and lives happily ever after\u201d trope. Anna\u2019s prince charming wound up being the villain, and the \u201cact of true love\u201d that saved Anna\u2019s life was saving her sister, Elsa.\n\nAnna did wind up falling in love with Kristoff in the B-plot of the movie, and the sequel will deal with their relationship as Kristoff tries (and fails) to propose to Anna early in the movie.\n\nLee says the core of the story was always about two sisters, and romance just wasn\u2019t where they were with Elsa as they wrote the sequel.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t change that from the outside because it wouldn\u2019t be authentic,\u201d Lee said. \u201cSo we didn\u2019t build Elsa a romantic story line. We weren\u2019t making a statement about it, we were just building from where she is now and felt like we needed to stay true.\u201d\n\ncaption \u201cFrozen 2\u201d takes place three years after the first movie, and Elsa is having a tough time. source Walt Disney Animation\n\nIn a scene screened for press at the Walt Disney Animation Studios, Elsa participates in family game night with Anna, Kristoff, Olaf, and Sven. But when it comes time for her to act out prompts in charades, Elsa balks.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very shy,\u201d Lee said of Elsa. \u201cRight now she\u2019s not ready for relationships. We knew she\u2019s still struggling. It\u2019s enough that her sister is getting her out of her shell, right? You saw how charades took a lot for her. But she has this incredible power inside her and she\u2019s wrestling with that. I\u2019m excited about where she gets to at the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrozen 2\u201d arrives in theaters on November 22.", "description": "Business Insider - Director Jennifer Lee told Insider that the character isn't ready for romance and how the team decided they couldn't take outside theories into consideration..
