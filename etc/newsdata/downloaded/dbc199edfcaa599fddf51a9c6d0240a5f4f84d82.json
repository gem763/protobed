Despite this effort, a quick Google search of \"product flops\" says it all: watermelon-flavored Oreos, purple EZ-Squirt ketchup, and even Google Glass.\n\nSo why is it so hard to understand consumers and what they want? Can't we just ask? Well, yes, but asking is only the first step.\n\nCustomers are (not) always right. What we, as customers, say we want is often different than what we actually want. Truly understanding customers requires listening, but also careful observation and product testing.\n\nBefore joining Lightspeed, I led several user research projects for startups including Thumbtack, BetterUp, Fundbox, and a pre-launch Indian beauty brand. Time and time again, I noticed that customers would say one thing, but mean another. When they said they wanted more choice, they actually meant they wanted fewer, yet more curated choices. When they said they wanted to be inspired, they first wanted to be educated.\n\nAshley Braiser. Courtesy of Lightspeed Venture Partners\n\nOver time, I've curated a set of techniques to help me better understand customers \u2014 in aggregate, a way to triangulate what consumers really need. In the same way a founder can triangulate total addressable market or projected growth rate, I believe a founder can also triangulate customer need. Listening, observation, and product testing techniques form the foundation of this approach.\n\nBelow I've included some example techniques for each \u2014 listen, observe, test. Think of this list as a menu. For any research project, you can select the most appropriate techniques based on what you're trying to learn and level of effort required.\n\nI've also included some real-life anecdotes.", "description": "Turns out, customers don't always know the full story of what they want, writes Ashley Braiser, a growth strategy and startup expert.", "authors": ["Ashley Brasier", "Lightspeed Venture Partners"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7954a72e22af05710a8c08-320-160.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
