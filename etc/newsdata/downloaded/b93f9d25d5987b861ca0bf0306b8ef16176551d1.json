After staring into the abyss, we have crawled back to a situation where our key objective has been achieved: there will be no hard Border.\"\n\nImage copyright IRISH INDEPENDENT Image caption Mr Johnson must \"achieve 'the impossible' one more time\"\n\n'Triumph of common sense'\n\n\"Pragmatism and mutual trust have prevailed,\" says a commentary in Germany's Tageszeitung. \"Johnson's opponents in the House of Commons... must now think twice about what they're doing.\"\n\nSpiegel Online agrees there has been an \"eventual triumph of common sense\".\n\n\"So no British economic tiger will roar off the shores of the continent. For many in the EU, that is a relief,\" it adds.\n\nImage copyright BILD Image caption \"The mood was extremely happy and relaxed\" Bild says of the atmosphere in Brussels\n\nBut is Mr Johnson \"happy too soon?\" wonders the Bild tabloid. The House of Commons vote on Saturday will be a real \"test of fire\", it says.\n\nIn France, Le Monde's Brussels correspondent C\u00e9cile Ducourtieux also wonders if the \"Brussels miracle\" can be repeated.\n\nIt's the \"last chance for a friendly Brexit\", says France's Le Figaro, noting that Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, whose numbers are crucial for a government majority, are \"standing by their rejection\" of the agreement.\n\n\"The tail is wagging the dog,\" says Hungarian newspaper Napi.\n\n\"If we look only at numbers ahead of the vote in Westminster tomorrow, this looks like a political suicide rather than gambling,\" says Italy's Il Giornale.\n\nAnd it's not just Northern Ireland that may prove a headache to Mr Johnson.\n\n\"Scotland voted to remain in the EU, and the autonomous government in Edinburgh intends to maintain close ties with Europe,\" says Italy's business daily Il Sole 24 Ore.\n\nJohnson 'surrendered to Brussels'\n\nSeveral commentators think the UK has accepted a worse deal than it had before.\n\n\"Johnson, despite all his tough talk, surrendered to Brussels in almost everything,\" says Slovakia's Dennik N. \"The changes concerning the Irish backstop are only cosmetic.\"\n\nImage copyright DENNIK N Image caption The new agreement \"has not resolved old disputes\"\n\n\"The UK prime minister received a bad deal in a nicer package. And maybe a friendly pinch on the cheek. Juncker's speciality,\" says one analysis in Greece's Protagon website.\n\n\"The Irish representatives' statements clearly show that Johnson suffered another defeat with the new agreement. Elegantly packaged of course, but still defeat,\" agrees Croatia's Novi List.\n\nDespite all that, there is optimism Mr Johnson will continue to champion it.\n\n\"The essential thing is certainly not that MPs vote for the deal,\" says France's Lib\u00e9ration. \"The important thing is that he should be able to present himself before Parliament, and above all, his future electorate, with something concrete in his hands.\"\n\n\"The leader of the Conservative Party will launch into a general election by presenting himself as the person who saved Brexit - an election for which he will hold all the cards,\" adds Belgium's La Libre.\n\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.
