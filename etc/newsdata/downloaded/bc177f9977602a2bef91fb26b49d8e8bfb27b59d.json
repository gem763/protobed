According to excerpts of the book obtained by Variety, the ex-NBC staffer Brooke Nevils claimed Lauer had raped her in a Sochi hotel room during the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\n\u201cI feel like we owe it to our viewers to pause for a moment,\u201d said Guthrie. \u201cThis is shocking and appalling, and I honestly don\u2019t even know what to say about it. I want to say that I know it wasn\u2019t easy for our colleague Brooke to come forward then. It\u2019s not easy now. And we support her and any women who come forward with claims. It\u2019s just very painful for all of us at NBC and at the Today show, and it\u2019s very, very difficult.\u201d\n\nMatt Lauer Blames His Accuser: \u2018She Certainly Did Not Cry\u2019\n\nKotb said she was having a flashback to two years ago when the women sat together on air to tell viewers about Lauer\u2019s firing.\n\nThe women had prayed upstairs before today\u2019s show, Kotb said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you feel like you\u2019ve known someone for 12 years... and all of a sudden a door opens up and it\u2019s a part of them you didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe allegations were not of an affair, emphasized Kotb, but \u201cof a crime. That\u2019s shocking to all of us who have sat with Matt for many, many years.\u201d\n\nKotb said that they would \u201ccontinue to process this part of this horrific story... Our thoughts are with Brooke. It\u2019s not easy, what she did, to come forward, it\u2019s not easy at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I speak for all of us: We are disturbed to our core,\u201d added Guthrie.\n\nGuthrie ended the segment by saying that they would \u201ccontinue to keep viewers informed\u201d as the story developed.\n\nIn a statement, NBC News said: \u201cMatt Lauer\u2019s conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time. That\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague.\u201d\n\nIn a somber opening to the Today show\u2019s third hour, both Al Roker and Craig Melvin also reacted to the news.\n\n\u201cIt's a really sad, sad day,\u201d Roker told viewers about what he called \u201chorrific allegations\u201d against Lauer. \u201cWe feel really badly for Brooke Nevils. Our heart goes out to her.\u201d\n\nMelvin, meanwhile, praised, Nevils for the \u201ccourage it takes to come forward, knowing that this is the kind of accusation that stays with you for years to come\u2014that\u2019s a special kind of bravery.\"\n\nDylan Dreyer lamented that Nevils and her colleagues at NBC \u201chave to re-live this all again.\u201d\n\nLater in the morning, Lauer responded to the fresh allegations with a stunning letter in which he said his involvement with Nevils was with her explicit consent during what he said was a mutual encounter in Sochi.\n\nHe accused Nevils of being a liar, and saying the story she tells \u201cis filled with false details intended only to create the impression this was an abusive encounter.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing could be further from the truth,\u201d he writes. \u201cThere was absolutely nothing aggressive about that encounter. Brooke did not do or say anything to object. She certainly did not cry.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
