Age is one of the biggest differences in the 2020 presidential race.\n\nMore than a generation separates the oldest and youngest candidates on the Democratic side. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard are 40 years younger than Sen. Bernie Sanders and 39 years younger than former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nOn the Republican side, President Donald Trump, the oldest first-term president, and former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld would also be in their mid-70s on Inauguration Day.\n\nOf course, age has little to do with a president\u2019s success. John F. Kennedy (the youngest elected president) and Ronald Reagan (the oldest) rank among the top 15 of U.S. presidents, according to Siena College's annual poll.\n\nJoe Biden: No plans to limit himself to one-term in the White House\n\nMore: The oldest, youngest presidential candidates in history\n\nStill, age is a lens that colors our view of the world.
