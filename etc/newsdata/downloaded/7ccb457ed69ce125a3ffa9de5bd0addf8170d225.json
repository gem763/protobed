Supermarket giant Woolworths in July took a stake in home meal kits group Marley Spoon, giving it extra grunt in a race against rivals such as HelloFresh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the business-to-business sector had been under-utilised, and the rising focus on health and well-being had been a strong catalyst.\n\n\"Healthy food has helped us gain a lot of traction,'' he said. Investors in the start-up in Singapore had included executives from Amazon, Netflix, Airbnb and Dell.\n\nHe said the Sydney operations of DishDash had reached a break-even point after 10 months, while in Melbourne it was even faster at seven months.\n\nThe company is set to raise $US6 million ($8.8 million) to help fund expansion to other cities like Dublin, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong.\n\nHe said the company was closely scrutinising the volatile situation in Hong Kong where pro-democracy protesters and police have been clashing for months.\n\n\"We're monitoring the situation obviously,'' Mr Schneider said.\n\nThe company was also eyeing expansion in Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth.\n\nSome of the expansion plans had been driven by international and national companies wanting to offer the same service to employees in other cities of their national networks.", "description": "A corporate food business with blue-chip clients like Google, Uber and BCG is raising $9m to fuel offshore expansion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_67/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/61d5ffcce3947ceea4149bbbd038c9004f7dc77c", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
