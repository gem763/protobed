We will continue to negotiate on behalf of you, your families and all workers in our country.\"\n\nPHOTO: John Kirk, right, a 20-year-employee, pickets with co-workers outside the General Motors Fabrication Division, Oct. 4, 2019, in Parma, Ohio. (Tony Dejak/AP) More\n\nDittes told workers that the UAW's bargaining committee along with UAW international staff presented a new proposal to GM on Saturday afternoon that addressed numerous issues, including wage hikes, job security and profit-sharing.\n\n\"The Company\u2019s response did not address our extensive package provided last evening. They reverted back to their last rejected proposal and made little change,\" Dittes wrote in his letter. \"The Company\u2019s response did nothing to advance a whole host of issues that are important to you and your families! It did nothing to provide job security during the term of this Agreement.\"\n\nDittes said union negotiators \"could not be more disappointed\" with GM's refusal to \"recognize the experience and talent of our Membership who make their world-class products and billions of dollars in profits.\"\n\nIn a response to Dittes' letter, GM officials issued a statement on Sunday saying that they \u201ccontinue to negotiate in good faith with very good proposals that benefit employees today and builds a stronger future for all of us.\"\n\n\"We are committed to continuing discussions around the clock to reach a resolution,\u201d GM's statement reads.\n\n(MORE: More than 49,000 UAW members go on strike against General Motors)\n\nThe apparent setback in the negotiations came just two days after Dittes told UAW members that they were making \"good progress regarding the issues of health care and a path for temporary employees becoming seniority members.\"\n\nPHOTO: Charles Cooke, a 20-year employee, pickets outside the General Motors Fabrication Division, Oct. 4, 2019, in Parma, Ohio.

In August, GM reported solid second-quarter earnings with income up $2.4 billion, an increase of 1.6% over the previous year.\n\n(MORE: GM agrees to resume covering health insurance costs for striking workers)\n\nThe strike comes nearly a year after GM announced it was laying off 15 percent of its salaried workers and shuttering five plants in North America. At the time, the company said it was \"transforming its global workforce to ensure it has the right skillsets for today and the future, while driving efficiencies through the utilization of best-in-class tools.\"", "description": "Negotiations to end a nationwide strike by 49,000 General Motors workers have \"taken a turn for the worse\" after union leaders said their latest proposal to end the walkout was brushed off by the company.  \"These negotiations have taken a turn for the worse,\" Terry Dittes, vice president", "authors": ["Bill Hutchinson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KmZ9IFcf_azwywp7x_1NoQ--~B/aD01NTg7dz05OTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/gma/us.abcnews.go.com/gm-ap-er-191006_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
