So, why not try a Yoga or Pilates class?\n\nThe classes are not as vigorous as other forms of exercise, yet they still improve strength and flexibility.\n\nWhilst there will be other people taking part in the class, you do have your own mat which you can place in a space you feel most comfortable.\n\nLuke Hughes, CEO of Origym, explained: 'Most Yoga and Pilates classes are also very welcoming and relaxed in nature, so individuals should have no trouble fitting in and feeling comfortable'.\n\nBARRE\n\nWhen taking part in a barre class, you work on ballet moves, but within your own space.\n\nFounder of Xtend Barre London, Catie Miller, said: 'Although barre is a great class to express yourself and be vocal if you wish, it is also a space well suited to someone who prefers to channel their energy inwards or have little interaction.\n\n'We work on ourselves in barre and despite the good energy in class, it can also feel like you're the only one in the room.'\n\n'Classes are often smaller in capacity than other exercise classes too and much of the instruction can be based at the barre, which might appeal to someone who prefers their own space or a more intimate environment.'\n\n'The famous burn from barre comes from repetitions of ballet-inspired movements and isometric strength training, so whatever happens, you'll be sure to challenge your body!'\n\nCLASSES FOR EXTROVERTS\n\nBOOT CAMP\n\nAccording to YouGov, over half (51%) of extroverts say they seek out challenging situations.\n\nBoot Camp requires teamwork and offers a variety of challenging exercises that change every session.\n\n'Extroverted individuals can bounce off others to push each other and ensure they both get optimal results,' explained Tom Jenane.\n\nExperts said how those with an extrovert type of personality would excel at dance as it's more of a 'social' activity\n\n'For this reason, bootcamp workouts are brilliant, as you can ensure you're all pushing each other to your maximum limit and minimising breaks.'\n\nWith the added pressure of working out with others, this means you are less likely to back out early, until the session has completely finished.'\n\nDANCE\n\nExtroverts would do well in dance classes, such as Zumba, as these are very social, with a huge focus on having fun whilst working out with others.\n\n'If you're looking for a group exercise that isn't gym-based, a dance class is a great option to consider,' said Luke Hughes.\n\nDance class attendees feed off the high-energy environment that is created when they all come together, which only makes them push harder and most importantly, enjoy themselves!'\n\nUNIQUE CLASSES\n\nOver half (52%) of extroverts claim they're not afraid of taking risks and seeking out challenging situations.\n\nTherefore, extroverts are more likely to try new exercise classes, even if they have never attempted them before.\n\nFor this reason, they're the perfect candidate for new exercise concepts such as aerial yoga and pole fitness.\n\nShara Tochia, co-founder of DOSE commented: 'Consumers are always looking to use their time more efficiently when working out combined with keeping their attention during their sessions.\n\nCombination workouts can be the best way to satisfy that demand, especially for those who fit the more 'extroverted' personality file.\n\nWhy do a boxing and yoga session when you can do a boxing yoga class at Total Boxer in Hornsey or strength and cardio class when you can do both in a signature class at Grow Fitness?!'\n\nCommenting on the research, a spokesperson from MINDBODY, added: 'While people have different fitness levels, it's also important to remember that people have different personality traits too, and these can impact the way we work out.\n\n'If you're struggling with motivation, or you're simply just not enjoying your workouts, then it's important to understand whether you're an introvert or an extrovert to determine what type of fitness plan/class will work best for you.\n\n'Whilst it's important to stay fit and active, it's just as important to enjoy yourself whilst working out too!'", "description": "A range of experts have advised six classes to try based one your personality-type - including HIIT, yoga and barre for introverts, and boot camp, dance and zumba for extroverts.", "authors": ["Chloe Morgan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/12/19359914-0-image-a-62_1570362070558.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
