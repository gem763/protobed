Elizabeth Warren speaks at the 2019 Iowa Federation of Labor Convention in Altoona, Iowa, August 21, 2019. (Gage Skidmore)\n\nEarlier this week, Elizabeth Warren launched an attack on Facebook. Her grievance? She\u2019s attacking the tech giant for allowing the Trump campaign to run an ad that contains misleading claims about Joe Biden. Yes, the ad is misleading \u2014 implying a tie between Joe Biden\u2019s demand that Ukraine fire its chief prosecutor and his son\u2019s business activities when we have no evidence that American and allied desires to oust the prosecutor had any relationship to Hunter Biden. But misleading ads are hardly new in American politics, and the answer for a bad ad is a better ad, one that rips the president for misleading America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacebook refused to remove the ad, citing a policy against policing the content of political advertising. Facebook\u2019s Katie Harbath wrote the Biden campaign and said the company\u2019s policy was \u201cgrounded in Facebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is.\u201d\n\nWarren was not pleased:\n\nFacebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. Now, they're deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people. This is a serious threat to our democracy. We need transparency and accountability from Facebook. https://t.co/anu0pWSqS5 \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 9, 2019\n\nBut Warren is wrong, and Facebook is right. Asking tech companies to police the truth of paid political ads opens a Pandora\u2019s Box of potential bias and censorship. Moreover, it\u2019s completely inconsistent with the general practice of television and radio advertising. As NBC\u2019s Dylan Byers pointed out, the ad has also run on NBC, ABC, CBS, Google, YouTube, and Twitter. Asking corporations \u2014 including corporations who attempt to outsource fact-checking to independent fact-checkers \u2014 to referee the contents of political ads would result in an increased corporate thumb on the scales of American politics. It\u2019s also inconsistent with American constitutional principles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, I know that Facebook is a private corporation and not subject to constitutional restraint, but I\u2019ve long argued that tech companies should voluntarily adopt policies that are informed by First Amendment values, and Facebook\u2019s policy is completely consistent with the First Amendment. For example, in 2016, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a permanent injunction against enforcement of Ohio\u2019s political false-statements law, and \u2014 as the court noted \u2014 similar political false-statement laws have been struck down time and again. Indeed, in United States v. Alvarez, the Supreme Court declared that it \u201chas never endorsed the categorical rule . . . that false statements receive no First Amendment protection.\u201d\n\nSo, who does Warren believe should police a politician\u2019s access to social media? She doesn\u2019t trust Facebook. And while independent fact-checkers vary wildly in quality, there is no conceivable American consensus around identifying any single political referee. Even if Warren did get her way, and fact-checkers ruled, she might not like the results. Her own campaign rhetoric is often false and misleading. Remember when she ignored an Obama Department of Justice report and falsely claimed that Michael Brown was murdered? That statement earned her four Pinocchios from the Washington Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler, one of the most rigorous fact-checkers in America. Craft an ad based on that rhetoric, and her campaign would have to support its own censorship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne final note \u2014 I\u2019m always intrigued at the level of fury applied to social media ads (especially ads on Facebook) over and above the fury applied to television and radio advertising. It\u2019s as if people attribute near-mystical powers to Facebook ad targeting mechanisms. Don\u2019t make that mistake. Facebook ads matter \u2014 like all ads matter \u2014 but they are not the magic keys that unlock the gates of the White House. There is no need to depart from the longstanding practice of dealing with campaign rhetoric through debate rather than censorship to face the challenge of false or misleading speech in online ads.", "description": "Even if Elizabeth Warren did get her way, and fact-checkers ruled, she might not like the results.
