Biden said the central point of a story he\u2019s told about traveling overseas to honor a war hero who refused a medal is correct, after a report suggested the 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner combined details about separate events into one incorrect narrative.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re talking about, but the central point is it was absolutely accurate what I said,\u201d Mr. Biden told the Post and Courier in South Carolina on Thursday.\n\nThe Washington Post had reported that it appeared Mr. Biden \u201cjumbled elements of at least three actual events into one story of bravery, compassion and regret that never happened.\u201d\n\nHe had relayed a story that a four-star general asked Mr. Biden, when he was vice president, to travel to Afghanistan to recognize the heroism of a Navy captain, who Mr. Biden said had rappelled down a 60-foot ravine under fire to retrieve the body of a fallen soldier.\n\nMr. Biden said the captain refused to be honored.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Sir, I don\u2019t want the damn thing!\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden said in the story. \u201c\u2018Do not pin it on me, Sir! Please, Sir. Do not do that! He died. He died!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the God\u2019s truth,\u201d Mr. Biden had said. \u201cMy word as a Biden.\u201d\n\nBut The Post reported that Mr. Biden had visited the area in question in 2008 as a U.S. senator, the service member was a younger Army specialist, and that the soldier in question \u2014 ultimately given the Medal of Honor by President Barack Obama \u2014 never had a medal pinned on him by Mr. Biden.\n\nThe report said that in 2011, Mr. Biden did pin a medal on a different soldier who felt he didn\u2019t deserve the award.\n\n\u201cI was making the point how courageous these people are, how incredible they are, this generation of warriors, these fallen angels we\u2019ve lost,\u201d he also told The Post after the story first published. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the problem is. What is it that I said wrong?\u201d\n\nHe told the Post and Courier that there were \u201ctwo stories\u201d \u2014 one that related to an operating base in Afghanistan and a separate one \u201cwhere I went on the streets of Afghanistan where a young man pulled someone from a burning humvee.\u201d\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t think he was conflating the two stories.\n\n\u201cThe story was that he refused the medal because the fella he tried to save and risked his life saving died,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the beginning, middle and end. The rest of you guys can take it and do what you want with it.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden has a noted history of verbal missteps that has continued into his 2020 bid for the White House.\n\nHe recently confused Vermont with neighboring New Hampshire and told attendees at the Iowa State Fair that \u201cwe choose truth over facts,\u201d in addition to the war story and other verbal miscues.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
