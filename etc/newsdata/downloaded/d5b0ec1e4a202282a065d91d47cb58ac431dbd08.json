Probably not, but in case you're looking to branch out \u2013 or possibly just to celebrate International Podcast Day \u2013 it's actually pretty easy to get started.\n\nYou can record a podcast on your phone, laptop or desktop, add some theme music and do a quick edit, and be up on Spotify and other platforms within minutes.\n\nIt could cost you anywhere from $50 on up to buy gear to record your show, but the tools for distribution, which used to be costly, are now free, thanks to Spotify's 2019 purchase of the podcasting app and website Anchor.\n\nAnchor podcasts (Photo: Anchor)\n\nThe family plan: Spotify upgrades Family plan subscription, rolls out parental controls for music service\n\nApple Arcade: This is what will make the subscription service a winner\n\nMore on that in a minute. Before we get into gear, we want to start at the end, with publishing, because that's what's changed dramatically, for the better.\n\nIn the early days of podcasting, to get a show onto major podcast platforms like Apple Podcasts required an laborious method of submitting, including going out and finding a place to \"host,\" or store the recording of, your show.\n\nLibsyn, for instance, charges $5 monthly and allows 50 megabytes of storage, which is the amount of new content you can upload each calendar month. Libsyn says the average one-hour show works out to 30 MB, so you'd be able to post one episode per month under this plan.\n\nAnchor is free. No hosting or storage charges. And like Libsyn, Art19 and other distributors, it will take your podcast and push it out to other platforms, like Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts and Stitcher.\n\n(Rob Welch, the vice-president of podcaster relations at Libsyn, points out that Anchor will not get your show to other outlets like iHeartRadio, Radio.com, Deezer and Pandora. \"So their distribution is more limited then with Libsyn.\")\n\nAnchor has its place but there are concerns. Namely you don't own your own Apple feed without jumping through some hoops. I did interview the CEO last year when the first controversies came up.https://t.co/hHnGiYIPOb \u2014 Unstructured (@unstructuredp) October 2, 2019\n\nAs a really quick test, I pulled a quick audio interview with my mom, posted it to Anchor and, within a few days, had the podcast on Spotify, Breaker, Google, RadioPublic and Breaker.\n\nThe entire process took just a few minutes. First, I titled the podcast \"The Jefferson Graham Interview\" (I already do USA TODAY's Talking Tech podcast) and created a 600-by-600 pixel image in Photoshop to use as cover art.\n\nFor those without access to Photoshop, free programs like GIMP and Pixlr Editor can also be used. Additionally, Anchor has tools to use on its premade templates.\n\nAfter uploading the art and audio file, I wrote a headline and description and found, to my surprise, that the show was available on Anchor and Spotify instantly.\n\nSpotify, in honor of Podcast day, announced that it will not let you combine music and podcasts to playlists.\n\nNow let's go backward.\n\nYour first podcast\n\nMost first podcasts are interview programs because talking into the microphone by yourself for hours on end just isn't something most of us can do. Plus, who wants to listen to us to rant?\n\nIf you're feeling more ambitious and want to do a news/documentary series, a live talk show with multiple guests or a historical look back at the history of music, you're reading the wrong article. Those will take multiple people to be involved in the production, more elaborate gear, access to tape libraries, legal clearances and the like.\n\nMicrophones\n\nIf you're on a low budget, pick up two USB mics (of different manufacturers) to go directly into your computer, or get one and have your guest sit very close to you, so that you are sharing the mic.\n\nThe Blue Microphones $50 USB Snowball mic is great, and so is the Samson Q2U, which is just under $60. The website ThePodcastHost recommends the Samson as it can be used for both USB and the more professional-oriented XLR, which means it can plug into cameras and higher-end audio recorders. That's something most USB mics can't do.\n\nSoftware\n\nFor a simple interview, you can record directly into the computer, using programs like Audacity on Windows or Garage Band on Macs.\n\nIf you want to do a talk show\n\nIf you're looking to have multiple guests, you'll need a mixer for the various voices. On the low end, you could pick up a Yamaha MG10, which sells for just over $150. On the high end, if you've got $600 to spare, the Rode Procaster is the best mixer we've come across. It has inputs for 4 XLR microphones, can also connect to Bluetooth and record smartphone conversations in the midst of a podcast. You can plug the unit directly into your laptop and record the sound that way, or directly onto a micro-USB memory card in the unit. And the sound is stellar.\n\nReaders: any questions about podcasting? We're here to help.
