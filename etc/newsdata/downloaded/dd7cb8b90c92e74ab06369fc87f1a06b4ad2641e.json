But the decision triggered an immediate backlash from different political parties, who objected to the use of \"dog-whistle\" phrase used by the far-right, calling it an \"insult\" and \"not acceptable.\"\n\nIn a highly unusual intervention before von der Leyen has formally taken over at the Berlaymont, Juncker told Euronews he objected to the move and predicted it would be reversed.\n\n\"I don't like the idea that the European way of life is opposed to migration. Accepting those that come from far away is part of the European way of life,\" said the outgoing Commission president. The \"European Way of Life\" meant merging main talents and energies, and respecting others irrespectively of their color and origin, Juncker said.\n\nHe added that the job title didn't correspond with the values of Schinas, who had been his chief spokesperson during the past five years.\n\nSenior Renew Europe MEP Pascal Canfin said Wednesday his group would demand von der Leyen change the portfolio title.\n\nCommission spokesperson Mina Andreeva said Thursday she had \u201cno name change or any changes to announce,\u201d adding that \u201cat the moment, there\u2019s clearly no quick decision.\u201d", "description": "The outgoing Commission president said he did not like the implication that accepting migrants is against European values.", "authors": ["Hans Von Der Burchard"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1157409873-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
