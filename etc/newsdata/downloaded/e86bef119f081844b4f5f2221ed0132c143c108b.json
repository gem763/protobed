He blamed the products for the \u201cnew epidemic of critically sickened youth,\" including a 17-year-old from the Bronx who died of a vaping-related illness on Oct. 4.\n\nState and city officials are investigating, and have not disclosed what products the teen was vaping. One published report said he was using cartridges containing THC, a main ingredient in marijuana.\n\n\u201cI love kids. As the statement says, this is particularly bad for children,\u201d Dinkins said in a follow-up interview Monday. \u201cWhat made me get involved? That\u2019s what.\u201d\n\nHe said he couldn\u2019t recall if anyone asked for his support, which provides political cover for Council Speaker Corey Johnson and others concerned about opposition to the proposed menthol ban from Al Sharpton, one of the country\u2019s most outspoken black activists. \u201cI don\u2019t remember. When you get to be my age, you won\u2019t remember,\u201d Dinkins said.\n\nHe plans to submit his written statement ahead of the rally, which coincides with the 10-year anniversary of a citywide ban on flavored tobacco. It\u2019s being hosted by Flavors Hook Kids NYC, a campaign spearheaded by a national anti-tobacco outfit that receives much of its funding from another former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg.\n\nSharpton has said the Council\u2019s proposed ban on menthol cigarettes would criminalize a product popular amongst black people. In an interview Monday, he invoked the NYPD killing of an unarmed black man, Eric Garner, who was selling loose cigarettes on Staten Island at the time of his death in 2014.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not addressing the issue that we raised,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the ban. The issue is, where in the bills do we deal with the criminal justice fallout and that we don\u2019t end up with another Eric Garner? And they avoid that issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s asking Corey about stop and frisk, and enforcement, and why they\u2019re supporting legalizing marijuana,\u201d he added. \u201cYou try to go into First Baptist Church and say, \u2018Grandma you can\u2019t smoke your Newport anymore but junior can smoke a joint.\u2019 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to sell in the churches I go to.\u201d\n\nDinkins said he agrees with Sharpton\u2019s concerns, but is more worried about health consequences.\n\nAs of last Tuesday, 1,299 vaping-related lung injury cases have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has confirmed 26 deaths in 21 states from patients with a history of using e-cigarettes or other vaping products. The matter led President Donald Trump to break with many conservatives in his party and announce a ban on all non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo also moved to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, but he initially excluded menthol, which Dinkins called \u201cthe greatest weapon in special interest tobacco\u2019s war against our health\u201d because \u201cthey are easy to start smoking and harder to quit.\u201d Cuomo has since said he intends to add menthol to the regulation, though the emergency ban has been blocked in court.\n\nDinkins said he smoked menthol and non-menthol cigarettes alike after joining the Marines in the 1940s, and quit several years later.\n\nMenthol cigarettes were exempt from a national ban on flavored cigarettes in 2009.\n\n\u201cNew York City cannot wait any longer for Congress or New York State to close the deadly menthol loophole,\u201d Dinkins said in his statement. \u201cThe well-being of our most vulnerable New Yorkers hinges on leaders taking a stand against special interest tobacco at this critical moment.\u201d\n\nOne Council bill would ban all flavored e-cigarettes, including menthol. So far it has 26 sponsors, the minimum needed to pass. Another measure, which has 32 backers, would prohibit regular menthol cigarettes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned the hard lesson about the danger of leaving menthol on the market,\u201d e-cigarette bill sponsor Mark Levine said. \u201cEven the Trump administration includes this flavor in its proposed vaping ban. But waiting for an unreliable and unstable president to act is not an option.\u201d\n\nJohnson, who plans to run for mayor in 2021, has openly talked about using a mint-flavored Juul to wean himself off of cigarettes this year. Nevertheless, last month he declared his support for outlawing flavored e-cigarettes because he said they \u201care being targeted towards children in a way that it becomes a gateway to real cigarettes if you\u2019re young enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not proud of my Juul, but, you know, it\u2019s a bridge hopefully for me to ultimately be totally nicotine free,\u201d he said.\n\nMonths after Sharpton made his opposition known, the menthol ban received the backing of Hazel Dukes of the NAACP, who wrote Johnson a letter in September urging him to support it.\n\n\u201cEvery day the menthol loophole is left open, dozens more addicts are made in our city \u2014 and they\u2019re mostly black and brown,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Johnson is concerned about the health impacts of menthol flavors in tobacco products and is working diligently with stakeholders to best address this major problem,\u201d his spokesperson Jennifer Fermino said. \u201cHe has been meeting with the NAACP along with other stakeholders and expects to announce something soon.\u201d", "description": "The 92-year-old former mayor will announce his support for two City Council bills to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes and regular menthol cigarettes.", "authors": ["Sally Goldenberg"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/63/de/412d6a2d492e991519d58e1668d5/former-mayor-david-dinkins.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
