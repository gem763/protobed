'Johnson &Johnson and (subsidiary) Janssen chose billions over children.'\n\nJ&J said the award was 'grossly disproportionate with the initial compensatory award in this case, and the company is confident it will be overturned.' It added that the jury in the case had not been allowed to hear evidence of Risperdal's benefits.\n\nThe lawsuit is one of thousands claiming that the antipsychotic drug Risperdal causes young men to grow breasts, and that drugmaker Johnson & Johnson failed to properly warn them\n\nProfessor Carl Tobias of the University of Richmond School of Law said he expects the punitive damages to be lowered on appeal, citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision which found that 'few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.'\n\nTobias said the verdict was about sending a message.\n\n'A jury, if it's outrageous enough conduct, will award a big number and let the lawyers and judges work it out,' he said.\n\nTobias added that the verdict could be a sign that J&J will face more large damages awards in other Risperdal cases.\n\n'The kind of evidence in this trial may persuade another jury or judge to do something similar,' he said.\n\nMurray, like other male plaintiffs in the mass tort litigation over Risperdal, alleges that he developed breasts after being prescribed the medicine when he was a minor.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug in late 1993 for treating schizophrenia and episodes of bipolar mania in adults.\n\nA Johnson & Johnson building is shown in Irvine, California in a file photo\n\nPlaintiffs claim that J&J failed to warn of the risk of gynecomastia, the development of enlarged breasts in males, associated with Risperdal, which they say the company marketed for unapproved uses with children.\n\nIn his lawsuit, Murray, now 26, alleged that he developed breasts after his doctors began prescribing him Risperdal off-label in 2003 after a psychologist diagnosed him with autism spectrum disorder.\n\nDoctors are allowed to prescribe medicines as they see fit, while companies are only allowed to promote their drugs for approved uses.\n\nA jury in 2015 awarded Murray $1.75 million after finding J&J was negligent in failing to warn of the risk of gynecomastia.\n\nA state appeals court upheld the verdict in February 2018 but reduced it to $680,000.\n\nPlaintiffs in the mass tort litigation had been barred from seeking punitive damages since 2014, when a state court judge ruled that the law of New Jersey, which prohibits punitive damages and is J&J's home state, should be applied globally to the cases.\n\nBut a Pennsylvania Superior Court ruling in 2018 cleared the way for punitive damages awards, holding that the law of each plaintiff's state should instead apply.", "description": "A Philadelphia jury ruled ruled in favor of Nicholas Murray on Tuesday, awarding $8 billion in punitive damages to the man who previously won $680,000 over his claim about Risperdal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/05/19474962-0-image-a-33_1570596528094.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
