Blame how close the r is to the T.\n\nCan you see it? (Picture: Facebook)\n\nDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not imagining things \u2013 thousands of people on social media see the swear word, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the good news is that most of those who\u2019ve seen it far prefer the idea of a \u2018f*** off\u2019 cake. Look at those rude little ghosts.\n\n\u2018Absolutely love it, the f-word makes it better,\u2019 said one commenter.\n\nAnother said: \u201910/10 I love this cake for all the reasons it is a fail.\u2019\n\nThe good news for the baker (whoever they may be): there\u2019s no need to start from scratch. Either play the insult off as a deliberate trick or sneakily ditch the topper entirely.
