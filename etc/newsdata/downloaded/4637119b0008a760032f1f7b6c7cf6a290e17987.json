REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\n\nBritain\u2019s Wetherspoon, like most restaurant chains in the country, has been battling increased costs due to a minimum wage hike, higher property prices and power bills. It has also been investing in its more labour-intensive food and coffee business.\n\nIt has however still managed to attract patrons to its more than 900 pubs in Britain and Ireland as it keeps drinks prices low, providing a cheaper alternatives for Britons who often face high costs to drink in pubs, restaurants and clubs.\n\nPretax profit after exceptional items rose to 95.4 million pounds ($118.5 million) for the year ended July 28 from 89 million pounds a year earlier, although before exceptional items, it fell 4.5% to 102.5 million pounds.\n\n\u201cCosts were quite high as we invest in the business and gardens and kitchens and people,\u201d Chairman Tim Martin, a vocal Brexiteer, told Reuters.\n\nInitially called Martin\u2019s Free House, Wetherspoon has also been spending to upgrade facilities at its older pubs.\n\nTotal sales rose 7.4% to 1.82 billion pounds, while like-for-like sales rose by 6.8%, with a jump in bar and food sales.\n\nSenior market analyst Fiona Cincotta at Cityindex said the company had fared a lot better than many of its rivals.\n\nShe warned however that the rate of sales growth had slowed, putting more pressure on the company\u2019s already-thin margins.\n\n\u201cJ D Wetherspoon may be attracting plenty of people into its pubs but it\u2019s luring them with such cheap prices that its margins have deteriorated,\u201d she said.\n\nRival Greene King (GNK.L) said earlier this year that a wet summer and poor sentiment had hurt its sales in its new financial year.\n\nPINK GIN WITH STRAWBERRIES\n\nWetherspoon\u2019s like-for-like sales rose 5.9% for the six weeks to Sept. 8. Martin said growth recently and in the full year had come from the sale of coffee, real ale and also gin.\n\n\u201cEveryone is drinking gin. Even the guys from the building sites down the road are drinking pink gin with strawberries. It is quite a revolution,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company\u2019s performance comes at a time when the UK\u2019s pub sector is brimming with deals.\n\nGreene King is set to be bought by Hong-Kong\u2019s Ck Asset (1113.HK) for 4.6 billion pounds, while Slug and Lettuce pub chain owner Stonegate has agreed to buy Ei Group (EIGE.L) for 1.27 billion pounds.\n\n($1 = 0.8048 pounds)", "description": "J D Wetherspoon's pretax profit rose in the full year as its \"cheap and cheerful\" pubs pulled in customers seeking pink gin and coffee as well as traditional beer even as Brexit worries hurt overall consumer confidence and spending.", "authors": ["Noor Zainab Hussain", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429376993&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0NL", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
