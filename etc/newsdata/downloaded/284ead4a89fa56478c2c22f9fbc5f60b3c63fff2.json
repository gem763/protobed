An added incentive is that in some regions, there has seen an uptick in luxury rentals as buyers stay on the sidelines and sellers opt to hold out for a better market.\n\n\n\nIn New York, for example, consumers may be looking to wait out the market for a lower price or, alternatively, keep their assets to invest elsewhere. And they have more options for luxury rentals, as developers of those buildings are creating the same amenities that people have come to expect in luxury condominiums.\n\n\n\nSome areas of London have seen double-digit rent inflation, and with sales prices so low, investors are set to take advantage, according to a report Thursday by Home.co.uk, an online property portal. Neighborhoods, like Haringey, have already seen prices grow, and the real estate website predicts median sales prices will start to stabilize as a result.\n\n\n\nMore: For a Safer Bet in a Tough Luxury Market, Consider the Penthouse\n\nInvestors often look to cities with high rates of tourism for deals, so Miami is also seeing increased interest, said Stephanie Anton, president of Luxury Portfolio International. And she noted that consumers in smaller southern towns, such as Charleston, North Carolina, and Austin, Texas, are also picking up properties with intentions of short- or long-term rentals.\n\n\n\nAlthough some may be tempted to wait for further cuts, prices are low enough for buyers to take the plunge, agents said. And, for potential buyers who plan to rent their properties out, getting in now means they can take advantage of high rents.\n\nMore: Amid Political Changes, Buyers Would Be Wise to Consider Prime Central London\ufeff\n\n\n\nNew York\n\n\n\nIn New York, rents are up across the board, with luxury units up almost 4% in August since this time last year, according to a Douglas Elliman report released earlier this week. The median rental price for luxury apartments, defined by Elliman as the top 10% of leases, was $8,000 a month in August, up 3.9% compared to $7,700 the previous year.\n\n\n\nDemand is high for apartments, partially because people are renting instead of buying, said Hal Gavzie, executive manager of leasing for Douglas Elliman. Worries about a potential recession and other uncertainties have sidelined some buyers, while others may be waiting for falling sales prices in the luxury sector to hit rock bottom.\n\n\n\nAnd prices are still slipping. The median sales prices dropped 6.2% to $6.15 million in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $6.56 million for the same time period in 2018, another Elliman report found.\n\nMore: Forget Perfectly Timing the Market and Focus on What You Can Do Instead\ufeff\n\n\n\nSo, for sellers who don\u2019t need to cash in right away, renting out their property now might mean getting a better price in the future.\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause the market is not a seller\u2019s market, if the seller is in a position where they don\u2019t need the income right away, it might make sense to wait,\u201d said Vickey Barron, an agent with Compass in Manhattan.\n\n\n\nAnd she has plenty of clients ready to rent out these same luxury properties.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the luxury market, people are looking for quality and a certain lifestyle,\u201d Ms. Barron explained. \u201cIt\u2019s more about finding that than the price.\u201d\n\nMore: When Renovating to Sell, Focus on Kitchen Modernization, But Don\u2019t Go Overboard\ufeff\n\n\n\nAlthough New York City has always had a healthy supply of rentals, developers have found an enthusiastic audience for luxury buildings with top-of-the-line amenities.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an increasing interest in rentals that offer the luxury and lifestyle you\u2019d find in an upscale condo,\u201d said Richard Cantor, a principal at the real estate agency Cantor Pecorella.\n\n\n\nThe firm is handling sales at the Alyn, a 20-story rental tower on the Upper East Side slated for completion at the end of the year. It boasts a fitness center created by Homage, a fitness design company, four levels of parking and a playroom designed by the children\u2019s architecture firm Silver Hill Atelier. Rents there are between $10,000 and $35,000 a month, and the project is already over 80% leased, Mr. Cantor said.\n\n\n\nHis clients range from empty nesters to new New Yorkers still getting a feel for the city. Others want to invest their assets in the stock market, where they may get better returns, he added.\n\nFrom Penta: Future Returns: Investing in the \u2018Food Revolution\u2019\ufeff\n\n\n\nCantor Pecorella also handles sales, and is currently representing Celeste Gramercy, a mid-market project. There, Mr. Cantor is seeing some investors purchasing homes they intend to rent, as well as parents buying homes for their children.\n\n\n\nMs. Barron said it\u2019s an \u201cexcellent time to buy,\u201d noting low interest rates and good deals in the city.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople always think they can get a better deal, but they can wait too long and miss the curve,\u201d she said.\n\nMore: A Fed Rate Cut Could Be Good News for Some Luxury Housing Market Sectors\n\nLondon\n\nConcerns over Brexit have shaken consumer confidence in London, and sales in the city have been in a tailspin as uncertainty continues. But as prices have plummeted, investors are taking advantage.\n\n\n\nNow, a dearth of available rental property and much reduced asking prices has brought investors back into the London market, despite government measures increasing taxes on landlords, the Home.co.uk report found.\n\n\n\n\u201cLondon takes the spotlight this month as soaring rents tempt investors back into the capital\u2019s letting market,\u201d the report said. \u201cRock-bottom sales and rental stock levels are initiating a revitalization of the London sales market, led by several key boroughs.\u201d\n\n\n\nInventory is down, and six London boroughs\u2014Wandsworth, Hackney, Haringey, Hammersmith and Fulham, Southwark and Islington\u2014have seen significant rent increases. Competition from buyers for limited product is stabilizing sales prices, the report found.\n\nMore: Development Pipeline Is a Weather Vane for Home Prices\n\n\u201cSales stock levels in the central London boroughs haven\u2019t been this low for several years and prices look set to surge accordingly as demand picks up,\u201d Doug Shephard, director at Home.co.uk, said in the report.\n\n\n\nRenewed investor interest is in spite of a 3% increase to the stamp duty tax in 2016 for those who own more than one property, as well as the phasing out of a mortgage interest deduction on buy-to-let properties in 2017. The deduction has been lowered by 25% each year since and will be eliminated in 2020.\n\n\n\nKnight Frank\u2019s August Prime London Lettings Index found the number of new prospective tenants increased by 22% year over year compared to July 2018. At the same time, the number of new lettings listings grew by 1%.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis growing imbalance between supply and demand will continue to exert upward pressure on rental values,\u201d the report said.\n\nMore: As the Market Produces \u2018New\u2019 Neighborhoods, Who Decides How Much a Name is Worth?\n\nIn addition, would-be buyers in London have looked to rent, as uncertainty in the sales market continues. Super-prime leases, those more than \u00a32,000 (US$2,466) a week, signed in the second quarter of 2019 was 40, the highest figure for the second quarter in more than five years, according to the report.\n\n\n\nAnd like prime sellers in New York, many have opted to rent rather than sell until price inflation returns.\n\n\n\nMiami and Other Southern U.S. Locales\n\n\n\nRents were up in Miami in August in all sectors, and the average was $1,729 a month in August, an increase of 4% year over year, the real estate website RentCafe reported.\n\n\n\nMs. Anton said Miami is one place investors look for second-homes they intend to rent, largely because its year-round warm weather and proximity to beaches attracts so many visitors.\n\nMore: Whisper Listings are Most Effective When a Home is Truly Unique\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening in markets where we know that there is a tourist population,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they want to rent, they can do long-term, but also short-term.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s happening in places like her home city of Austin, as well, Ms. Anton noted. Some buyers may forgo a luxury property for two or more mid-level properties they can easily rent, she added.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's a big part of the population, and part of the people who are buying property to rent it out,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have a home and they are staying there and then maybe investing in mid-tier properties to rent out.\u201d\n\nClick for More In-Depth Analysis of Luxury Lifestyle News\ufeff\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["V.L.
