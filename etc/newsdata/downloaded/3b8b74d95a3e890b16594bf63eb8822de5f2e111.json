Cardinals manager Mike Shildt was forced to add offensive punch to his lineup in exchange for defense \u2014 a strategy that backfired early.\n\nHudson lasted just 15 pitches and faced only eight batters before he was replaced by veteran right-hander Adam Wainwright.\n\nYadier Molina hit a homer for St. Louis in the fourth to make it 7-1. The Cardinals scored three in the fifth, highlighted by a two-run double by Jose Martinez to trim the margin to 7-4.\n\nHard-throwing Tanner Rainey came on to pitch for the Nationals and retired all three batters to halt the momentum. Sean Doolittle pitched a scoreless seventh and came back out to start eighth.\n\nThe Nationals allowed just six runs in the series against the Cardinals.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
