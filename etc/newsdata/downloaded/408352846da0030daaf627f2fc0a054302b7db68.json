That picture you posted last night of you in the hospital was brave.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaddy is then unsure whether or not to open up about his own disability, but decides to in the end.\n\nGeorgina in hospital bed (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nHe continues: \u2018I know how hard it is to talk about your condition when people ask. I know this because I have cerebral palsy in my legs. I haven\u2019t told people yet but felt I could trust you with this.\u2019\n\nGeorgina is taken aback by the revelation, as Paddy hasn\u2019t previously chosen to share any photos clearly showing his cerebral palsy to the group.\n\nThey both start crying.\n\nShe messages back: \u2018May I ask why you feel you want to hide it from the group? It can remain our secret, but I don\u2019t want you to feel like it\u2019s something that you have to keep quiet.\u2019\n\nPaddy responds: \u2018It\u2019s not that I\u2019m ashamed or scared. It\u2019s that I wanted to feel what it would be like for once to just be me and not be \u201cthat disabled guy\u201d\u2018.\n\nThat was such a powerful conversation!\n\n*Sends Paddy and Georgina a virtual hug* #TheCircle pic.twitter.com/NWRe3pSmki \u2014 The Circle (@C4TheCircle) October 6, 2019\n\nFans immediately took to social media to share how emotional watching the scene made them.\n\nOne tweeted: \u2018I cried when he told Georgina about his disability. When are humans gonna stop labelling each other and just see everyone as equal humans?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile another wrote: \u2018Absolutely loved that chat between Georgina and Paddy, and the reason why this show is so different from Big Brother. When you are not face to face, it can lead to the best conversations because you are genuinely being yourselves.\u2019\n\nThen another tweeted: \u2018Genuinely powerful discussion of the Patient Experience of Georgina\u2019s Crohns & Paddy\u2019s Cerebral Palsy.\u2019\n\nThe Circle continues Monday at 10pm on Channel 4.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
