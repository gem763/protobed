Our forces are working there with the coalition forces,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nThe US troops that had been deployed near the Turkish boder have pulled back to areas not affected by the invasion but have not yet left the country.\n\n\u201cWe want there to be a role for America in Syria, not only Russia and others monopolising the scene,\u201d said Abdi, whose forces turned to the Moscow-backed regime of President Bashar al-Assad for protection when US troops pulled back.\n\n\u201cIt is in our interest that the American forces remain to maintain balance in Syria.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish advance and chaos that ensued sparked concerns that thousands of IS suspects and their family members in Kurdish custody could break out and bring about a resurgence of the extremist group.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Strategic nightmare\u2019 \u2013\n\nUS Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell called Trump\u2019s decision \u201ca strategic nightmare\u201d.\n\n\u201cWithdrawing US forces from Syria is a grave strategic mistake,\u201d McConnell wrote in The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cIt will leave the American people and homeland less safe, embolden our enemies, and weaken important alliances.\u201d\n\nThe suspension of hostilities has looked designed to help Turkey achieve its main territorial goals without fighting.\n\nThe Kurds have little leverage left other than the custody of thousands of wanted jihadists of more than 50 different nationalities.\n\nThe autonomous Kurdish administration is now counting on Syrian government forces to keep Turkey and its proxies at bay along the border.", "description": "Ras al-Ain (Syria) (AFP) \u2013 Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan fired off a fresh warning Saturday to \u201ccrush\u201d Kurdish forces as", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/6e7d04_turkish-offensive-has-killed-dozens-civilians-on-kurdish-turkey-kurds-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
