She told us the other day about doing another \u201clistening tour.\u201d\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton made listening tours famous, using them to build buzz for her New York Senate and presidential campaigns. Now, she\u2019s on another. In an email to supporters, the 2008 and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate said, \u201cI\u2019d like to hear what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d While she isn\u2019t talking about running for president a third time, Clinton said that she has been talking to people about key issues, including immigration reform and electing Democrats \u201cat all levels\u201d in 2020.\n\nRead the rest here.\n\nWe\u2019re supposed to believe that the consummate narcissist and grifter isn\u2019t contemplating a re-run against President Trump in 2020? Let\u2019s check out a couple of her recent statements. Here\u2019s a laughable one.\n\nHillary Clinton said Tuesday that she believes the \u201cgutsiest\u201d thing she ever did outside of public life was deciding to stay married to former President Bill Clinton.\n\nRead the rest of her ridiculousness here. She\u2019s also called President Trump an \u201cillegitimate president\u201d and a \u201ccorrupt human tornado.\u201d And just the other day, she claimed during a PBS interview that she \u201ccould beat Trump again\u201d in 2020 (plus other nonsense):\n\nAsked about Trump\u2019s tweet earlier in the day, which mockingly suggested she join the race and again bemoaned her missing emails, the former first lady and secretary of state expressed wonder at what she called Trump\u2019s obsession with her. \u201cYou know, it truly is remarkable how obsessed he remains with me. But this latest tweet is so typical of him. Nothing has been more examined and looked at than my emails. We all know that. So he\u2019s either lying or delusional, or both,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no subpoena, as he says in a tweet this morning. So maybe there does need to be a rematch. Obviously, I can beat him again,\u201d she continued, before suggesting she was making the comment in jest.\n\nRead the rest here.\n\nThe woman\u2019s narcissism and hubris are insufferable, especially given that she is guilty of many crimes and has been enabled by federal law enforcement throughout her entire \u201ccareer.\u201d As a life-long grifter, she has always been about the money and has used her political station to accrue money via elaborate pay-for-play activities and/or just plain corruption. Whether it was cattle futures or foreign contributions laundered through the Clinton Foundation while she was Secretary of State, she has always been about accumulating the wealth to which she believes she \u2013 as a typical liberal elitist \u2013 is entitled. Hers was a classic coattails career \u2013 she was elected to the US Senate in New York not on her own merits but rather solely because she was the wife of a US president. It is perhaps the biggest joke there is to think that she is actually \u201csmart.\u201d The reality is quite the contrary.\n\nShe used the Clintons\u2019 accumulated wealth to corruptly leverage and control various Democrats and apparatchiks during her run for the presidency in 2008. The notion that she was \u201cowed\u201d the nomination because she saved Bill\u2019s presidency is humorous to contemplate but probably exactly what she thought. She has always been cursed (or blessed from my point of view) with a political tin ear which has been evident for all to see. A horrible and boring candidate capable of only spouting poll-tested platitudes, she was easily swamped by Obama during the 2008 Democrat primary.\n\nI have always suspected that Obama was blackmailed by the Clintons into appointing her as his first Secretary of State. The Clintons could have made much mischief for Obama had Hillary not received that sinecure. Their purpose to see her made Secretary of State was two-fold: to give her some foreign policy credentials that she lacked for her next run for the Oval Office, and more importantly to have the US State Dept serve as a nexus for their foreign pay-for-play schemes.\n\nLost among the dross of the \u201cmuh Russia hoax\u201d over the past 2.5 years is the fact that the Clintons received MILLIONS from\u2026.wait for it\u2026.the RUSSIANS courtesy of the Uranium One deal. And we\u2019re supposed to just \u2018fuhgeddaboudit\u201d because \u201cOrange Man Bad\u201d? It\u2019s one thing for her to have gotten away scot free with her pay-for-play schemes while supposedly \u201cserving the people\u201d while Secretary of State (she probably got a good laugh about twisting that phrase into \u201cserving herself\u201d). It\u2019s quite another to have almost certainly traded some of the nation\u2019s most precious secrets for some of that foreign cash. (They\u2019ve been doing that for years. How do you think the Chinese jumpstarted their satellite and nuclear first strike capabilities?)\n\nEven the Obama-appointed IC IG at the time (who now just happens to be a lawyer for the Ukraine leaker!) disclosed that Hillary\u2019s server contained at least 22 Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) emails on it, as well as dozens of lesser-classified emails \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t include who knows how many other highly classified emails conveniently \u201cdestroyed\u201d by her team of crooks in the early stages of the Mid-Year Examination (the FBI\u2019s name for their faux investigation of her server).\n\nWhile Loretta Lynch and James Comey effectively squelched the investigation of her server in 2016, largely thanks to Judicial Watch, there have been periodic new revelations that have cracked the fa\u00e7ade carefully constructed by the Clinton Democrats and their media allies. For example, we learned some weeks ago that nearly 130 State Dept employees are likely to lose their security clearances (and may be subject to other well-deserved disciplinary actions?) because they knew about that illegal server and didn\u2019t report it. Here is a report by RedState\u2019s \u201cstreiff\u201d toward that end. And the latest revelation is that Judicial Watch is likely to finally force depositions under oath by Hillary Clinton and her trusted aides after all this time:\n\nOn August 22, 2019, the court then ruled that Clinton and Mills had 30 days to oppose being questioned in person under oath by Judicial Watch related to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. Additionally, Judicial Watch was granted seven new depositions, three interrogatories and four document requests. In granting the additional discovery, U.S. District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth commented: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything they\u2019ve discovered in this period raises serious questions about what the hell the State Department\u2019s doing here.\u201d\n\nRead the rest here.\n\nWhat makes me most furious about her crimes is not that she\u2019s a life-long grifter and has been enabled throughout her grifting career by federal law enforcement who have looked the other way at every step of her journey. What is possibly even worse are her periodic in-your-face comments about her various crimes, e.g., the infamous \u201cwhat difference at this point does it make\u201d comment when under questioning during the Benghazi hearings. Or that the destroyed 30K+ emails only contained \u201cyoga and wedding plans for Chelsea.\u201d Or that she didn\u2019t have any classified information on her email server at all! Let\u2019s face it: the woman is a bald-faced liar \u2013 and is not very good at it, given her tin ear and body language.\n\nJudicial Watch has been peeling back the onion that is Hillary\u2019s shifting defense against going to jail for violating the Espionage Act and the statutes governing mishandling classified information. The tortured excuse offered by Comey to let her off the hook, i.e., there was no \u201cintent\u201d to disclose the classified information was a double lie, in my opinion. First of all, \u201cintent\u201d is nowhere in the statute; simple negligence resulting in the compromise of TS/SCI information is entirely actionable \u2013 there is no defense or escape (for average people). Second, I believe there was in fact intent on the part of Hillary and her minions, as some of those classified emails were purposely sold to our adversaries as part of her pay-for-play scheme. The woman had access to advanced technology secrets, information about US spies operating overseas, and other highly classified information, and we\u2019re supposed to believe that someone who sold American uranium to the Russians would somehow not also sell those secrets? I suspect that what has been covered up about her pay-for-play scheme would shock the nation if all of the details were ever made public. The fact that \u2013 so far \u2013 only a few administrative acts have been taken against all of the perps is a travesty!\n\nWhat also galls me, as a recently-retired long-time national security professional, is the insistence by her supporters \u2013 including those in the legacy media such as the Democrat hacks that now infest Fox News Channel \u2013 that she was thoroughly investigated and \u201cexonerated\u201d by Comey. First of all, they don\u2019t understand the personal obligations of ANYONE with access to TS/SCI information. Second, they don\u2019t understand that those accessing that information were required to sign nondisclosure agreements (NDA) that incur lifelong obligations. Third, each disclosure of a classified email is a separate instance that is punishable. The felonious actions don\u2019t just get bundled together as a single felony. Fourth, anyone granted access (which means being cleared and also determined to have the \u201cneed to know\u201d the specific info) is trained in the handling of \u2013 and the penalties for mishandling \u2013 classified information. Fifth, that training and the signed NDA obligate to report any known compromises of classified information, whether inadvertent or purposeful, including by anyone else. By the way, this is precisely why those State Department employees are losing their clearances; they did NOT report known/observed violations by Hillary and her immediate staff.\n\nFor all of these reasons, it should be remembered that ANYONE who claims that Hillary was \u201cexonerated\u201d is a bald-faced liar who either has no understanding of the governance, statutes, and obligations surrounding the handling of classified information or else actually understands the requirements and is simply lying for political purposes. Either way, that person is a complete liar on the subject.\n\nI remain convinced that those 30K+ \u201clost\u201d emails are in fact still available for analysis and subsequent legal action. The fact that Judicial Watch may finally force a real deposition under oath from Hillary and her lawyers is a promising sign that justice \u2013 although delayed \u2013 may finally be served. Believe me when I tell you this: Hillary, Cheryl Mills, Heather Samuelson, and the rest KNOW they\u2019re guilty as sin and have to be sweating bullets about being forced to testify before officers of the court who haven\u2019t been bought and paid for by the Clintons.\n\nI have always wondered how the Clintons were seemingly always able to escape the hoosegow when the evidence of their corruption in the public record alone would have been more than enough to convict \u201cregular people.\u201d Given the corruption uncovered in DoJ and the FBI since President Trump was inaugurated, we know exactly how they have avoided the hangman over the years: they bought and paid for DoJ/FBI insiders to hijack and falsify investigations. They also bought and paid for a virtual army of media sycophants to spin things favorably to the Clintons and undermine investigations. True, some of these people, as sympathetic ideological allies to the Clintons, worked for \u201cfree.\u201d Or rather for future consideration for jobs in a Hillary White House or elsewhere in a new Clinton administration). Until Hillary\u2019s email server was uncovered by Judicial Watch and others, Loretta Lynch was on the path to becoming a USSC judge. Sally Yates was likely to become Hillary\u2019s Attorney General for \u201cservices rendered,\u201d and \u201cAndy\u201d McCabe would have probably relieved Comey as the FBI director. Just imagine the damage these lying corrupt-ocrats would have done in a Hillary administration!\n\nI can assure you that the ONLY way Hillary and the others were let off the hook was through corruption, as they are all guilty of multiple counts of violating classified information handling statutes, as well as breaking their life-long NDAs. Those of us who have held TS/SCI clearances and understand the consequences of mishandling classified information are NOT going to let this subject go away until Hillary and the others are in jail. I pray that that smug look of that supremely insufferable woman will one day be wiped off her evil face!\n\nThe end.\n\n[Note: a future article here at Red State will be a short tutorial on classified information that explains what classified information is, how it is to be protected, the obligations of everyone granted access to classified information, and the rules governing its handling under all circumstances.]", "description": "On the Insufferable Hillary Clinton", "authors": ["Stu Cvrk", "Brandon Morse", "Sarah Lee", "Seton Motley", "Sister Toldjah", "Joe Cunningham", "Wrongthink Radio", "Nick Arama", "Elizabeth Vaughn", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/i-can-again-preview.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
