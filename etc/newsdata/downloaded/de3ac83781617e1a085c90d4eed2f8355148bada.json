Due to the recent drop, HSBC made the unusual move of lowering its price targets for the companies while simultaneously upgrading it ratings. HSBC took its price target for Uber to $44 a share from $49 a share and Lyft to $62 a shares from $67 a share.\n\nOverall, HSBC thinks that the ride-sharing business and food delivery service can become profitable for both companies. The firm cited two foreign companies as examples, pointing to Russian ride-sharing company Yandex Taxi and Chinese food delivery service Meituan Dianping as profitable ventures.\n\n\"We think the ridehailing businesses of Uber and Lyft can reach profitability if both pull back on sales & marketing and leverage the fixed cost base,\" Kahn said. \"In ride-hailing and food delivery globally we see room for only two large players and expect more consolidation in both sectors.\"\n\nDespite the upside potential, HSBC continues to see headwinds in the form of \"higher regulatory risks and a lower longer-term growth outlook for their Rides businesses,\" Kahn said.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.", "description": "While upgrading both stocks, HSBC made the unusual move of lowering its price targets for the companies.", "authors": ["Michael Sheetz"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105948061-1559653155102ap_301652267577.jpg?v=1559653289", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
