We can maybe get something from them but not $62 billion. It\u2019s an opportunity we have lost.\u201d\n\nNigeria has been fighting for the cash under a 1990s law that states it can revisit production-sharing contracts on oil output if crude prices exceed $20 a barrel.\n\nSylva said talks about recouping some money from oil majors, such as Shell, Chevron, ENI and ExxonMobil, were ongoing.\n\nThe companies received individual requests for cash in February, with one telling Reuters its bill was nearly $10 billion. Shell and Chevron are fighting the cases in court, according to scheduled cases seen by Reuters.\n\nSylva said the government must quickly pass amendments to the underlying law to ensure it did not miss out on more revenue.\n\n\u201cWe have to ensure that this bill is passed. With this bill now, there will be some adjustments in the fiscal regime and we believe that the government will get a lot from the oil companies, especially their deep shore exploration activities.\u201d\n\nThe senate passed amendments to the bill on Tuesday. Last week, President Muhammadu Buhari said the government could get an additional $500 million in 2020 and $1 billion in 2021 by revising the law.\n\nThe government in Africa\u2019s largest oil exporter relies on oil for some 90% of foreign exchange. Oil prices rose to more than $100 a barrel in 2014 before a sharp drop that triggered a 2016 recession in Nigeria, leaving the government struggling to fund its budgets.", "description": "Oil minister Timipre Sylva said Nigeria knows it cannot recover $62 billion from oil majors despite ongoing cases against the companies for money the government believes it is owed.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
