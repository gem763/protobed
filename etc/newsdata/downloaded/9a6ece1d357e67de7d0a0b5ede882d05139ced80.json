REUTERS/Mike Blake/Illustration\n\nMaking new shows is part of a larger strategy that will be revealed in the near future, a spokeswoman told Reuters, declining to elaborate on the plans. The source familiar with the production said it is Tinder\u2019s first foray into creating an online platform for scripted video content.\n\nThe multi-episode series centers on an \u201capocalyptic\u201d storyline and includes a relationship sub plot but is not directly connected to Tinder\u2019s core dating app business, the source said. It was filmed in Mexico City in late August.\n\nTinder\u2019s move should not be a big surprise given its ownership. Parent company Match is majority owned by IAC, founded by Hollywood legend and IAC Chairman Barry Diller.\n\nLast October, Tinder launched a lifestyle website called Swipe Life to publish original content including articles and videos about dating and relationships.\n\nOffering original content is an increasingly popular strategy for the mostly U.S.-based technology and retail industries that have already attracted millions of devoted users. Walmart Inc is working with MGM to boost Walmart\u2019s Vudu video service. Costco Wholesale Corp has also considered video plans to keep customers interested in the brand.\n\nThe strategy seeks to engage users on a deeper level even when they are not using the service. That could help Match hold on to its rapidly growing customers. Its shares have risen more than 75% this year as it continues to add subscribers.\n\nReuters reported in April that Airbnb Inc, the start-up for booking home rentals around the world, has ambitions to develop a slate of original shows to whet customers\u2019 appetite for travel.\n\nFor several years, Airbnb has considered various ideas for creating or licensing mini-series and documentaries about travel, and shows featuring Airbnb homes, guests and hosts, according to the Reuters story.\n\nIt was not clear when Tinder\u2019s first series will launch or how Match Group will promote it.", "description": "Popular dating app Tinder has\u00a0wrapped filming on its first television series, as owner Match Group Inc seeks to dive deeper into creating original content,\u00a0people with direct knowledge of the project told Reuters.", "authors": ["David Alire Garcia", "Angela Moon", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430546949&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1E2-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
