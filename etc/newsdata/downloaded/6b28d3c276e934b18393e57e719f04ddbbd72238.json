The latest example is the Asus ZenFone 6, which you may have seen, thanks to its unique gimmick: a rear camera that flips up to become the selfie camera. It\u2019s one of the many clever ways phone companies are trying to make a truly edge-to-edge screen, and you\u2019re virtually guaranteed to get a reaction when you show it off.\n\nThe ZenFone 6 is a $499 phone \u2014 $599 if you want upgraded RAM and storage \u2014 and the bar for phones at that price point is significantly higher than it used to be. It\u2019s not enough anymore for even a \u201cbudget\u201d phone to nail the basics. It has to have something that sets it apart and above the slew of other sub-$600 phones. You probably think the ZenFone 6\u2019s camera-flipping trick is its main feature, but that\u2019s not my favorite thing about this phone.\n\nThe best thing about the ZenFone 6 is the battery life, which is astronomically good.\n\nOur review of Asus Zenfone 6 Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Incredible battery life\n\nFast\n\nGood selfie camera Bad Stuff Big and heavy\n\nLCD screen not great in sunlight\n\nPoor low-light camera performance Buy for $499.99 from B&H\n\nThe ZenFone 6 is a big, thick phone. It has a 6.4-inch screen, but thanks to minimal bezels, it\u2019s not quite as chunky as it might otherwise be. I found it hard to use one-handed and was surprised to see that it weighs less than an iPhone XS Max because it feels way heavier.\n\nBut the benefit of making a big phone means that Asus could fit extra stuff inside. There are all of the mechanics required to get the entire camera module to flip out from the back to the front. There\u2019s a 5,000mAh battery that will last forever; I\u2019m getting two days of pretty heavy use with no problem. (That\u2019s eight to nine hours of screen time, as Android counts it, including hours of network- and processor-intensive games.) Brute force may not be the most elegant solution to extending battery life, but until battery technologies improve, it\u2019s certainly the most effective.\n\nAsus ZenFone 6 specs Processor: Snapdragon 855\n\nRAM: 6GB or 8GB\n\nStorage: 64GB, 128GB, or 256GB, expandable\n\nScreen: 6.4 inches, 2340 x 1080 LCD\n\nMain camera: Sony IMX586 48-megapixel image sensor, f/1.79\n\nWide angle camera: 13 megapixels, 125-degree field of view\n\nBattery: 5,000mAh\n\nAudio: dual speakers, headphone jack\n\nAll that space also means there is a headphone jack, which is increasingly rare but apparently still considered necessary on midrange and lower-end phones. Asus couldn\u2019t fit wireless charging in there, but that might be more of a cost decision than a space problem. Besides, charging a 5,000mAh battery at wireless charging speeds sounds like a nightmare. Apparently, Asus could have chosen a smaller battery with faster wired charging speeds than the 18W it supported, but it opted to go with the bigger battery instead.\n\nI\u2019m glad Asus decided to make that trade-off. In fact, I\u2019m glad about a lot of the trade-offs that Asus made with the ZenFone 6.\n\nThe screen is a perfect example. It\u2019s huge, but it\u2019s only 1080 x 2340, so it\u2019s not as tack-sharp as screens on other phones. It\u2019s also an LCD instead of OLED, which means the blacks are less black and it\u2019s difficult to see outdoors, but both choices mean that the ZenFone 6 can be less expensive. The lower-resolution screen also means that the phone needs to push fewer pixels, which is a significant boon to the battery life.\n\nAsus pushed the screen out close to the edge of the phone, yet there\u2019s still a bezel because getting rid of those last few millimeters means adding a few hundred dollars to the cost. But for all that, the screen still looks impressive because it\u2019s big, the bezels are small, and there\u2019s no notch or camera cutout.\n\nAsus cut costs without making it feel like a cut-rate phone. There\u2019s a fingerprint sensor on the back, which is glass but feels almost like metal. The phone feels good and solid, but you can definitely find the seams between the different parts that make up the body. Compared to the $479 Pixel 3A XL, the ZenFone 6 is a huge upgrade in every way but one: the camera.\n\nAll right, I\u2019ve made you wait long enough: let\u2019s talk about that wild camera. It flips! There\u2019s a 48-megapixel main sensor paired with a 13-megapixel wide angle lens. Flipping it around means you get the high-quality cameras for your selfies instead of whatever tiny little thing can fit above or inside the screen on other phones. Plus \u2014 and I cannot emphasize this enough \u2014 it flips.\n\nObviously, I can\u2019t speak to its durability over time, but it seems solid after a week of use, and Asus has given the usual promises that it\u2019ll hold up. The phone doesn\u2019t have a rated dust or water resistance IP number, so I\u2019d avoid letting either get anywhere near the mechanism. It\u2019ll also auto-flip back to its home position if it detects a fall.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t move as quickly as you want, taking maybe a second to do its thing, but that\u2019s only a half-second longer than many camera apps take to switch over to the selfie camera anyway.\n\nBeyond showing off the flip to your friends, you can also move it manually using the volume keys. That means you can hold the phone in different positions to get your shot. One thing I figured out early on is that it can be a little creepy. You look like you\u2019re holding your phone to text, but really, the camera has subtly flipped out so you can take a photo, like so:\n\nThe rule for budget phones used to be that no matter how nice everything else was, the camera was crap. The Pixel 3A broke that trend, and while I think the 3A is better than the ZenFone 6\u2019s dual-camera setup, it\u2019s not by much. The ZenFone 6 kicks out 12-megapixel images by default that are surprisingly good for a phone in this price range.\n\nIts photos are not as contrasty as the Pixel or as impressive as the OnePlus 7 Pro, but in decent lighting, it was sometimes more of a matter of preference than quality between these phones. One thing to know is that, in dim lighting, the ZenFone\u2019s camera falls down, at least when compared to the Pixel.\n\nBut with selfies, well, the ZenFone stacks the deck by using its main sensors, so those photos are consistently better than what you\u2019re probably used to. I\u2019ll also note that I like Asus\u2019 camera software \u2014 including the easy-to-understand beauty modes \u2014 but knowing what results you\u2019ll get between \u201cAuto HDR+\u201d and \u201cHDR++\u201d modes is a bit of a crapshoot.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the reasons this felt like such a surprise is because it didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. It came from Asus, which has a mediocre track record with phones. But it has cleaned up its act with the ZenFone 6, significantly changing its software philosophy to focus on less intrusive features. Like Motorola, Asus has made its version of Android feel very close to the vanilla version that you get on a Google Pixel, with extra features tucked away in unobtrusive places if you want them.\n\nThere\u2019s a game mode, but it doesn\u2019t bother you if you don\u2019t want it. You can choose between a few different core navigation features. There\u2019s wacky stuff for making duplicate versions of apps, using AI to optimize memory usage, and a bunch of other stuff that you may never use. (But at least they\u2019re buried in settings instead of in your face.)\n\nI really love the wonderfully programmable extra button that you can set to do lots of different things. Sadly, Asus put it at the top-right of the phone, so it\u2019s nearly impossible to reach.\n\nThe Asus ZenFone 6 is the best option at 500 bucks \u2014 as long as you don\u2019t mind a big phone.\n\nYou can get a better camera or a nicer screen for a couple hundred dollars more with the OnePlus 7 Pro. You can spend a couple hundred dollars more than that to get phones that are genuinely luxurious, like the iPhone XS or the Samsung Galaxy Note 10. You can spend way less and get a slower processor or a smaller phone. Even though it seems like your phone choices are dwindling, that\u2019s not really true. There are tons of options.\n\nIt can be hard for a phone to justify its existence among so many options, but the Asus ZenFone 6 totally has. It is a battery champion for not too much money that doesn\u2019t sacrifice the stuff phones usually have to, like screen size, the camera, or speed.\n\nThe flippy camera is a neat trick, but the real magic is getting the things people actually want into a $500 phone.\n\nVox Media has affiliate partnerships.
