Add in the fact that most had flown more than 11 hours to be at this conference in Tokyo for just a few nights, and the \u201cflight shame\u201d feelings were skyrocketing.\n\nBut this is not just an uncomfortable truth for those in the industry, it\u2019s one that many of us back home don\u2019t want to hear either \u2013 myself being one of them.\n\nLet me say first that I believe that the privilege of travel has enormous cultural, mental and physical benefits for those who can afford it, as well as huge economic advantages for communities that thrive off, and depend on, tourism. Were people to start travelling less, the world would be far worse off and that\u2019s not an exaggeration. But yes, if I\u2019m really honest with myself, my prime reason for continuing to travel is that I\u2019m a selfish millennial who\u2019s become used to this way of life and I don\u2019t want to see the back of it.\n\nWith a father in California and a mother in England (and now a sister in Australia), I\u2019ve grown up crossing the globe multiple times a year and I can\u2019t see a future where I don\u2019t do that. Some of my best memories are holidays with friends, and I\u2019m also a travel writer for this very paper and have been on several short trips to long-haul destinations.\n\nIs four nights in South Africa really worth the carbon footprint of 24 hours in the air round-trip? Credit: Ben1183/Ben1183\n\nThe high I get from going somewhere new means I hardly ever return from some far-flung place without something else in the pipeline: but is four nights in South Africa really worth the carbon footprint of 24 hours in the air round-trip? It\u2019s something I\u2019m increasingly finding harder to defend.\n\nThe good news from Tim Williamson was that he doesn\u2019t think we need to completely cut out flying. He advised that one out of every four flights should go, as well as introducing a Green Flying Duty that would raise fares by 10 per cent, putting the extra money into R&D for developing sustainable aviation faster. My most important takeaway from what he said though, and the easiest for anyone worried about their green credentials to implement, was that we need to stop the short flings abroad and bring back the traditional two-week holiday.\n\nWith the ever-expanding rise of low-cost airlines over the past 30 years, the quickie weekend city break has become a regular fixture for many, meaning many more flights per person per year. Instead of hopping to a new city for a couple of nights each time the weather becomes too grim to bear in Blighty, we need to revert to longer, more thoughtful holidays. In short, it\u2019s time to really think about making our flights count.\n\nUpgrade your long weekend in Barcelona for two weeks exploring Catalonia's coast Credit: george clerk\n\nThe maths is simple, turn three long weekends in Barcelona, Vienna and Rome into one two-week holiday to Catalonia and you\u2019ve already cut your emissions by a third. What makes it easier to do this is that a two-week holiday isn\u2019t just green, it actually makes for a better holiday. You\u2019ll have more time to properly switch off from your day-to-day and more time to travel further away from the overtouristed airport hubs to off-the-radar spots.\n\nSome of my other colleagues have pledged to cut out flying entirely, but I\u2019m not ready to take that extreme step and I don\u2019t think you need to either \u2013 partly because I think the benefits of travel outweigh the negatives of the carbon emissions for the time being. I admit we can\u2019t continue on the trajectory as it is and there needs to be a change, but I\u2019ll try anything that means I can keep my habit going. Combining a few of the shorter breaks I would usually take for one long one seems like an easy first step.\n\nWhat do you think? Do we need to swap multiple shorter trips for longer, more thoughtful holidays?
