Her fellow panellists are former Treasury official Michael Callaghan and Future Fund director Carolyn Kay.\n\nThe inquiry will naturally consider the cost of the age pension to the budget and stray into even more controversial areas, such as whether super might even be made voluntary for low-income workers. But as Ralston points out, there are glaring problems at the top end too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The tax concessions for these funds are a cost to government revenue and, indeed, tax savings for those on balances over $3.2 million exceed the costs of supporting an individual on a full age pension,\" she wrote.\n\nAccording to the Actuaries Institute, the full age pension is worth about $800,000 for a couple in their 60s and about $500,000 for a single person.\n\nWhat Ralston is saying is that the tax breaks for couples with more than $3.2 million in super (the limit is $1.6 million each) are potentially worth much more than that received by a couple on the age pension.\n\nYet much of the focus is on the \"burden\" of the age pension.\n\nActuarial firm Rice Warner previously proposed that super savers could be forced to transfer \"excessive\" amounts of money out of super when they reached a certain age, say 65. The firm suggested a threshold of perhaps $3.2 million.\n\n\"While such large funds are unlikely to be achieved under current caps, we would support an upper limit on super accounts, in the interests of limiting the use of tax concessions, and in the interests of intergenerational equity,\" Ralston said.\n\nLabor went to the last federal election with a plan to ban excess franking credits, a policy that would have been especially disadvantageous for SMSFs. Labor argued the generous cash rebates available to retirees via dividend imputation were also a matter of intergenerational inequity. Ralston, on behalf of the SMSF Association, campaigned hard against the proposed changes and Labor was defeated.\n\nA paper published last October by researchers at the Australian National University found that the value of imputation credits to retirees is large \u2013 potentially increasing their balance by 8 to 9 per cent and lifting their spending capacity by 5 to 6 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe researchers also estimated the net cost to the government of providing access to imputation credits for retirees, taking account of potential offsets via reduced age pension payments.\n\n\"For example, expected net cost per individual over the course of their retirement is about $20,000 for retirees that retire with a $100,000 balance, then rising to around $130,000 for those retiring with a balance of $1.6 million, in 2017-18 dollars,\" said the paper, entitled What dividend imputation means for retirement savers.\n\n\"To the extent that imputation credits supplement income in retirement, the loss of tax credits could have exacerbated the problem of the adequacy of superannuation balances for supporting a reasonable level of retirement spending,\" the paper also said.\n\n\"For future retirees, access to imputation credits in retirement might be seen as an alternative to making higher super contributions while at work.\"\n\nOf course, Labor's franking credit policy is likely to end up in the bin along with some of its other controversial tax plans. And it would be a brave government that would seek to make changes to dividend imputation.\n\nBut Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has not prohibited the inquiry from examining any issue pertinent to the retirement income system, which puts mega balances in the frame. Given the findings of the ANU study, franking credits will presumably be considered too.", "description": "SMSF members with account balances of more than $2 million drew down a whopping $11.7 billion in total tax-free income in 2016-17.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/baa21f15a85bd0b93242b125ef0c4f4a719b53d0", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
