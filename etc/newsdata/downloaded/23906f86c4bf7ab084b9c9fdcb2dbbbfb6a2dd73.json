Alibaba Can\u2019t Even Conquer Vietnam.", "language": "en", "text": "An employee at online retailer Lazada, owned by Alibaba, fills an order at the company's warehouse in Jakarta, Indonesia.\n\nLast year, Alibaba\u2019s Vietnam operation put together a plan to win big in toilet paper.\n\nIn the company\u2019s home base of China, toilet paper is a popular online purchase and volumes are typically huge. Staff bought hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth and offered it online at low prices, say people familiar with what happened.\n\nBut Vietnam\u2019s nascent e-commerce market wasn\u2019t like China\u2019s. Shoppers didn\u2019t rush to buy as much as projected, and Alibaba\u2019s local subsidiary, Lazada, sold a fraction of the original targets, the people say.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd. has long ruled the world\u2019s biggest online shopping market in China\u2014and many expected it to have conquered other markets by now. Instead, Alibaba, like many Chinese tech giants, has found how hard it is to translate domestic domination into international success.\n\nAlibaba handles more business on its shopping sites than any other company in the world. In its most recent fiscal year, ending March, its 654 million Chinese customers bought $853 billion of goods\u2014more than Amazon.com Inc. and eBay Inc. sell annually on their platforms combined.\n\nThe company had $56.2 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year, with $36.9 billion, or 66%, of that coming from its Chinese retail business.\n\nThe company made globalization a priority after going public in 2014, in the world\u2019s largest initial public offering. Despite investing more than $5 billion in places such as Singapore and India, it has struggled to gain traction. It got $2.9 billion, or 5% of its revenue, from its international retail business last fiscal year.\n\nThis is becoming a crucial issue for Daniel Zhang, who is taking the reins from founder Jack Ma as executive chairman on Tuesday. Mr. Zhang, Alibaba\u2019s chief executive since 2015, has personally overseen many of the company\u2019s international businesses. Unlike the flamboyant Mr. Ma, who relishes public speaking and radical ideas, Alibaba employees describe Mr. Zhang as a quieter leader who steeps himself in the details of company operations.\n\nMr. Ma told investors in 2016 that Alibaba needed another at least 1.2 billion people outside China to reach its goal of serving two billion customers.\n\nSome initiatives have shown promise, such as the performance of Alibaba\u2019s global shopping site AliExpress in Russia and Brazil, both large markets with price-conscious customers. Yet its bigger bets, including in Southeast Asia, have lagged behind competitors in growth or size, while bleeding money.\n\nAlibaba has had trouble navigating workforces and markets different from its own, at times employing a hard-charging, top-down management style that worked in China but not as well in other markets, say people familiar with the business.\n\nAn Alibaba spokesman said the company is committed to becoming a global player. \u201cSoutheast Asia is a market of high potential, and unlike our rivals, who focus on short-term, slash-and-burn gains, we play the long game,\u201d he said.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Why do Chinese companies struggle to expand in overseas markets? Join the conversation below.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s challenges abroad reflect the hurdles China\u2019s giants face in competing with Amazon, Google and other Western rivals globally. Many Chinese tech companies thrived at home with the help of staff willing to work punishing hours. Government policies have also limited foreign competition\u2014an advantage companies can\u2019t count on overseas.\n\nChinese tech companies including Tencent Holdings Ltd. , JD.com Inc. and Baidu Inc. have led $85 billion of deals overseas since 2014, according to data tracker Dealogic. There have been a few hits, such as Bytedance Ltd.\u2019s TikTok app, which has caught fire in the U.S. Many others are designed as long-term plays, making it too early to gauge their success.\n\nSo far none have managed to reach the scale and clout of their Western counterparts. Often, Chinese executives assume smaller markets will be a snap, only to learn otherwise, said James Chan, a Singaporean entrepreneur and investor who has worked with Chinese businesses in Southeast Asia.\n\nDaniel Zhang, chief executive officer of Alibaba, is its next chairman.

It doesn\u2019t feel pressure to win in all its international markets now and is laying the groundwork to reach a goal of two billion customers by 2036, a person familiar with company said.\n\nAnalysts say that with its deep purse, technological edge and hard-driving culture, Alibaba may yet win in many overseas markets. Last year, it acquired an e-commerce company in Pakistan and bought a stake in another in Turkey.\n\nSince 2015, Alibaba and its financial-services affiliate Ant Financial have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Indian online payments company Paytm and its e-commerce arm. The payments business has made significant inroads but the e-commerce business is far behind sites run by Amazon and Walmart Inc. unit Flipkart.\n\nSoutheast Asia seemed like a logical step for Alibaba when it bought a controlling stake in Singapore-based Lazada, at the time the region\u2019s largest e-commerce firm, for $1 billion in 2016. It added another $1 billion the next year and $2 billion more in 2018.\n\nE-commerce in the region, with 650 million people, was growing quickly, doubling in size to $23 billion last year, a study by Google and Singaporean state investment fund Temasek found. Many countries there are culturally and economically close to China.\n\nThree and a half years later, Lazada has lost share in key markets, and its No. 1 spot regionwide is being challenged by Shopee, a unit of Singapore-based Sea Group, according to data from app tracker App Annie and people familiar with the companies\u2019 sales. In Indonesia, the region\u2019s biggest market, Lazada last year ranked fourth among e-commerce companies, behind global unknowns Shopee, Tokopedia and Bukalapak.\n\nA Lazada spokesperson said e-commerce is at an early stage in Southeast Asia, adding that the company has the \u201cstrategic confidence and perseverance to do this as Alibaba Group\u2019s flagship e-commerce platform in this region.\u201d\n\nInitially, Lazada\u2019s executives\u2014mostly Europeans brought in by the company\u2019s founder, Rocket Internet of Germany\u2014were delighted by the Alibaba purchase, according to people close to the company. They admired the Chinese giant\u2019s Silicon Valley-like campus in Hangzhou, where employees zoom around on bikes and workers typically toil from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week\u2014the infamous \u201c996\u201d schedule of Chinese internet businesses.\n\nWorkers at a delivery distribution center in China during an annual Alibaba shopping promotion day.

It built Lazada a new technology platform in Hangzhou and shifted Lazada\u2019s business from focusing heavily on selling its own products to operating more like a giant marketplace, like Alibaba\u2019s sites in China or eBay in the U.S.\n\nIt encouraged more Chinese merchants to sell on Lazada and tried to reduce costly spending on discounts or advertising to attract customers. It sent veterans from Hangzhou, some of whom didn\u2019t speak much English, to help run Lazada\u2019s operations.\n\nSome Lazada executives felt overrun, even when they agreed with the changes. \u201cThey move very fast, very violently, which causes a significant rift\u201d with the local team, said one former Lazada executive.\n\nAlibaba executives told Lazada managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term market share, people familiar with the matter say. Lazada has publicly cited strong order growth as a sign its business is improving there.\n\nIn Thailand, one of Lazada\u2019s strongest markets, shoppers have grown suspicious of new Chinese merchants on the site offering inexpensive goods alongside descriptions that seemed translated by machine into the local language.\n\nThe product descriptions are \u201cnot what Thai people say,\u201d said 26-year-old customer-service employee Chanapa Kamawithee, who has shopped on Lazada for years and started noticing the change a few months ago. Ms. Chanapa said she now shops more on rival Shopee.\n\nBy the end of 2018, nearly all the senior executives from Lazada\u2019s pre-Alibaba days had gone\u2014many replaced by Alibaba managers.\n\nOne of them was Max Zhang, who was sent to run Lazada Vietnam last year. He had been a deputy of Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang (no relation), who hired him after he built one of the top-selling fashion brands on Alibaba in China.\n\nMr. Zhang, the new Vietnam chief, had never lived abroad or spent significant time in Vietnam, and was far more comfortable chatting with compatriots in Chinese than with local managers in English, said people close to the company\u2019s operations.\n\nHe was a relatively raw manager with little experience leading a company, say people who knew him. At one early town hall, Mr. Zhang said how lucky Vietnam was to have him, remarking that he was more famous in China than Lazada\u2019s then-CEO.\n\nMr. Zhang had a top-down management style that frustrated employees used to Lazada\u2019s flatter, more Western style of operating, people close to the business say. He seldom explained decisions and expected to be obeyed without question, they said.\n\nMr. Zhang wanted to wean Lazada Vietnam off discounts and other spending it had been using to boost results, the people said. He would often criticize the local team, saying, \u201cYou guys spend money like stupid,\u201d one of them recalls.\n\nHe abruptly halted most free shipping\u2014a move that pummeled sales as customers moved to other platforms like Shopee that were still subsidizing.\n\nThe move upset merchants in Vietnam, who were already perplexed by elements of Lazada\u2019s tech overhaul, and many moved to rival sites, said a person familiar with what happened.\n\nMr. Zhang tried to bring in customers by buying items\u2014such as toilet paper\u2014in bulk and bargaining for a good price. But Vietnam\u2019s relatively small online-shopping market didn\u2019t have enough buyers to purchase the goods.\n\nLazada delivery motorcyle in Thailand.

A Lazada spokesman said, \u201cIntegrating two distinct companies is a work in progress, and we are on a good track.\u201d\n\nMr. Zhang\u2019s efforts did cut down on customer subsidies and make Lazada\u2019s Vietnam unit healthier financially, said a person familiar with the operations. But sales and traffic sagged, and it ceded its No. 1 spot to Shopee.\n\nBy June 2019, Mr. Zhang had returned to China and the CEO of Lazada\u2019s Thai operations took over Vietnam as well.\n\nTwo months later, Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang made a visit to a town hall in Ho Chi Minh City. One message, posted on Lazada\u2019s Vietnam recruitment page on Facebook : \u201cIt\u2019s not about Taobao, it\u2019s not about Tmall. We need our own Lazada, in Vietnam, in Thailand, in Asean markets. We have to localize our business.\u201d\n\n\u2014Wilawan Watcharasakwet contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Phred Dvorak at phred.dvorak@wsj.com and Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com", "description": "The Chinese juggernaut handles more business on its shopping sites than any other company in the world.
