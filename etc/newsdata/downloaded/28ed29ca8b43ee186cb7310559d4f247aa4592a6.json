Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. I generally like to see some degree of insider ownership, even if only a little. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb said, 'Don\u2019t tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio.'\n\nDateline Resources is not a large company by global standards. It has a market capitalization of AU$24m, which means it wouldn't have the attention of many institutional investors. In the chart below below, we can see that institutional investors have not yet purchased shares. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholder can tell us about DTR.\n\nView our latest analysis for Dateline Resources\n\nASX:DTR Ownership Summary, September 18th 2019 More\n\nWhat Does The Lack Of Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Dateline Resources?\n\nInstitutional investors often avoid companies that are too small, too illiquid or too risky for their tastes. But it's unusual to see larger companies without any institutional investors.\n\nThere are many reasons why a company might not have any institutions on the share registry. It may be hard for institutions to buy large amounts of shares, if liquidity (the amount of shares traded each day) is low. If the company has not needed to raise capital, institutions might lack the opportunity to build a position. Alternatively, there might be something about the company that has kept institutional investors away. Dateline Resources's earnings and revenue track record (below) may not be compelling to institutional investors -- or they simply might not have looked at the business closely.\n\nASX:DTR Income Statement, September 18th 2019 More\n\nWe note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Dateline Resources. Our information suggests that there isn't any analyst coverage of the stock, so it is probably little known.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Dateline Resources\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nStory continues", "description": "A look at the shareholders of Dateline Resources Limited (ASX:DTR) can tell us which group is most powerful...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3YxKtBK.1rGRXPdECXsaGQ--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/3069b3cbfdab8fead8ef3548020a3b8d", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
