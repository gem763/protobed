Medicare For All is a pipe dream", "language": "en", "text": "Now that Rahm Emanuel doesn\u2019t need to worry about running for reelection as the Mayor of Chicago or grooming any Clintons for the White House, he has time on his hands and the freedom to say things that may be unpopular in his own party. This weekend he took full advantage of his unfettered position with an op-ed in the Washington Post where he takes his party to task for their obsession with Medicare For All.\n\nBy the time I finished reading the piece I was seriously surprised. This is some clear-eyed thinking that will see him burned to the ground among supporters of Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and the rest of the significantly more socialist 2020 hopefuls. But this one section of the essay should really inject a dose of reality into the Democratic debates, assuming anyone is willing to listen.\n\nMedicare-for-all is guaranteed to frighten many among the vast majority of Americans who already have health coverage. It would require a disastrously unpopular tax increase on the middle class. And it would unite a world of the special interests against us. This dog just won\u2019t hunt. Perhaps worse, we cannot afford to try and then fail. Losing on health care will make it more difficult for us to make progress on education, the environment or other social justice issues. We need to chart a different path. So let\u2019s use history and context as a guide. I\u2019m mystified as to why, at a moment when 90 percent of Americans already have insurance, our presidential debates are focused so exclusively on expanding coverage rather than containing costs. That\u2019s the challenge that bedevils most families constructing their monthly budgets at the kitchen table.\n\nRahm\u2019s full explanation of a better approach for Democrats on the issue of healthcare sounds dangerously sensible and I hope they don\u2019t listen to him. He\u2019s laying out a strategy that could wind up being very palatable to rank and file voters. We currently have a larger percentage of Americans with health care coverage than virtually ever before. Emanuel suggests targeted programs to get the remaining few covered rather than upending the entire apple cart and changing the health care system for the entire country.\n\nHe also lays out a list of the craziest items on the Democrats\u2019 agenda that will cost them an enormous amount of political capital. These include rewriting the entire tax code, \u201cdecriminalizing\u201d the border, giving everyone free college and eliminating fossil fuels with the Green New Deal. That\u2019s twenty pounds of crazy in a five-pound bag, as Rahm apparently realizes. With that in mind, he asks if Democrats should \u201cbe strategic on at least one big-ticket item.\u201d\n\nIf the eventual Democratic nominee runs on Medicare For All, Trump should be able to tear them apart on the debate stage and make their presidency a very frightening prospect for most middle-class voters who currently have health care coverage through their employers. (You\u2019ll notice that Biden is avoiding it like the plague.) The same goes for the Green New Deal. Some of the other \u201cfree stuff for everyone\u201d proposals might gain some traction, but those two are the real killers.\n\nYou can disagree with virtually everything Rahm Emanuel stands for (I know I certainly do), but he didn\u2019t survive for decades in the swamp and the Chicago Daley machine environment without knowing his way around electoral strategy questions. But as I said above, we can still hope that the 2020 candidates won\u2019t listen to him. If they do, Donald Trump could be in trouble next year.", "description": "Free to share opinions", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Taylor Millard"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/RahmEmmanuel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
