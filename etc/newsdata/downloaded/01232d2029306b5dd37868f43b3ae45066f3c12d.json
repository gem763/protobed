Other objects of desire are a little more taste-based. What\u2019s the next status water bottle or hand wash, for instance? Chris Black (he\u2019s a partner at brand consultancy Public Announcement) is here to help, in the form of a regular column. If you have a burning question about the next fanny pack or Noah rugby shirt, drop us an email with the subject line \u201cAsk Chris\u201d at strategist@nymag.com.\n\nWith the temperature cooling, I\u2019m looking to invest in a new throw blanket for my couch. Have any recommendations for a (roughly) $300 budget?\n\nI assume you keep your Herm\u00e8s cashmere blankets on the PJ? You want something a little more casual for your home \u2014 I get it!\n\nParachute Windowpane Alpaca Throw Parachute does one in a fluffy windowpane alpaca that is quite appealing. Warm, cozy, and very well-priced. $249 at Parachute Buy\n\nMissoni Sigmund Knit Throw The rest of my picks are a bit above your price range, but when has this column ever been about sticking to a budget?. This black-and-white lattice-inspired wool throw from Missoni will look great tossed casually on your vintage Ligne Roset microfiber Togo (or any sofa). It\u2019s art that keeps you warm. *Chef\u2019s kiss* $735 at Barneys New York Buy\n\nBarneys New York Double-Faced Cashmere Throw The double-faced cashmere throw from Barney\u2019s in-house brand also really speaks to me. The bright yellow will keep things cheerful in the gloomy winter months. It\u2019s the color of the sun! $895 at Barneys New York Buy\n\nLoro Piana Unito Fleecy Cashmere Throw And I have to include something from Loro Piana. [Future voice]: How could I not?! Nothing is more luxurious than gray cashmere. This will make watching Bill Maher on Friday nights much more comfortable. $1,900 at Barneys New York Buy\n\nYou gave some great sock picks to last week\u2019s color-curious reader. Wondering if you could suggest a few more stylish fall/winter pairs in more neutral/understated palettes?\n\nAs a known loafer enthusiast, I don\u2019t wear socks during the warmer months; I just find that it ~kills~ my look. But with temperatures dropping, it\u2019s time to wrap your lower extremities in luxurious fabrics.\n\nCharvet Ribbed Cotton Socks A ribbed cotton pair from Charvet in a seasonally appropriate shade of Army green would work well with almost any outfit. $50 at Mr Porter Buy\n\nAnonymous Ism Three-pack M\u00e9lange Knitted Socks If you want understated, this trio from Japan\u2019s sock gods Anonymous Ism should do the trick. Three different shades of gray to complement all of your introspective fall moods. $55 at Mr Porter Buy\n\nKapital Smiley Leopard-Jacquard Cotton-Blend Socks I know you asked for understated, but I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t share this incredible leopard pair from Kapital (leopard, for some, is a neutral after all). The heel features the brand\u2019s signature smiley face, which I find incredibly charming. I actually have a few pairs, and honestly, the secret smiley puts some pep in my step! $65 at Mr Porter Buy\n\nCorgi Men's Luxury Hand Knitted Cable Pure Cashmere Socks Nothing says pure luxury like a handmade pair of cashmere socks from Wales. This cable-knit version from Corgi \u2014 which supplies members of the royal family with their socks \u2014 comes in a plethora of colors in addition to this neutral oatmeal, and is meant to be worn around the (country) house. Snuggle up by the fire with a cup of tea and the newest episode of Below Deck. Pure bliss. $165 at Corgi Buy\n\nI just had to start wearing glasses recently. I want to look stylish, but feel overwhelmed by the options, so I would love to see a rundown of the most important eyeglasses for right now and 2020, as well as where to get them.\n\nWelcome the Four Eyes Club\u2122. My name is Chris, I will be your guide. I have worn glasses since I was in middle school, I have years and years of relevant experience. You are in good hands.\n\nCutler and Gross 1313-02 Crystal Optical Glasses I am loyal to Cutler and Gross. The customer service at the New York location on Mercer Street is second to none, and the product is outstanding. To start, maybe you want to try something round and clear \u2014 a statement, but not a crazy one. The 1313-02 Crystal would work. It\u2019s a modern look that says, \u201cYes, I am actually an architect.\u201d $440 at Cutler and Gross Buy\n\nMoscot Telena Moscot is another brand I have a soft spot for. Family-owned, steeped in history, and they make a great spectacle! The Telena is a new shape that looks very cool in classic tortoiseshell. It\u2019s a little bold, but will give you the \u201cprofessor who wears old Celine\u201d look that you desperately crave. $280 at Moscot Buy\n\nMatsuda Silver Titanium 10189H Glasses The fully round wire-frame look is SO CHIC. My head is too big to pull it off, but it looks great on most people. This pair from Japanese brand Matsuda is perfectly delicate and will inspire you to read a tattered copy of Slaughterhouse Five fireside in the Bowery Hotel lobby. Perfection. If you like the look but want to spend less, Moscot also makes a round wire-frame pair that\u2019s only $320. $475 at SSENSE Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
