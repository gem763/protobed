Maybe they\u2019re going to change their tune now, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nTrump has come under criticism from allies including Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and his former United Nations ambassador, Nikki Haley, for his announcement late Sunday that the U.S. wouldn\u2019t stand in the way of the Turkish incursion.\n\nThe White House statement was read around the world as Trump abandoning U.S. policy that Kurdish allies would be protected from Turkish aggression in exchange for their help in defeating Islamic State.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, who is among the top Democratic contenders to challenge Trump\u2019s re-election in 2020, said in a statement that \u201conce again, an impulsive and erratic president has abandoned friends of the United States with a late-night tweet.\u201d\n\nAmerican officials didn\u2019t immediately explain the president\u2019s change in position on Syria.\n\nTrump\u2019s order to remove about 50 U.S. troops from a Syria border region Turkey intends to invade doesn\u2019t represent a green light for the incursion, the U.S. official said. The official added that Trump had discussed the decision with officials at the State Department and Pentagon before the White House announcement, and that the agencies should not have been surprised.\n\nThe U.S. had successfully dissuaded Turkey from an invasion for two years, but if Erdogan orders an operation, the U.S. doesn\u2019t want its soldiers endangered or caught in the crossfire, the official said.\n\nI\u2019ve told President Erdogan, I hope he\u2019s going to treat everybody with great respect,\u201d Trump said at the meeting with military leaders. Earlier, he told reporters at the White House: \u201cI have consulted with everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fully understand both sides of it but I campaigned on the fact I was going to bring our soldiers home,\u201d he said.\n\nThe administration official did not say that any U.S. soldiers would be brought home as a result of the withdrawal. The troops moved from the border region, mostly special forces soldiers, would be re-positioned at different U.S. bases in Syria, the official said.\n\n(Updates with more Trump remarks, beginning in fourth paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Josh Wingrove in Washington at jwingrove4@bloomberg.net;Justin Sink in Washington at jsink1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Wayne at awayne3@bloomberg.net, John Harney\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t endorsed a Turkish incursion into Syria, a senior administration official said, deepening confusion around his policy after an uproar from Republicans that he planned to abandon U.S. Kurdish allies.The official said Trump has cautioned Turkish President Recep", "authors": ["Josh Wingrove", "Justin Sink"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
