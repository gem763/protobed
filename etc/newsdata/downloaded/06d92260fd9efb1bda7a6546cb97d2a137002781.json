He called for deepening negative interest rates at a rate review in July but did not put the proposal to a vote.\n\nIn a footnote of the text of his speech released on Wednesday, Mr Kataoka said cutting the short-term rate target would help change the shape of the yield curve to a more accommodative one. He did not elaborate on how this could happen.\n\n\"At present, there is a gap between our inflation target and actual price moves. As such, it's necessary to strengthen monetary easing,\" Mr Kataoka said.\n\nThe board is currently split between reflationist-minded members like Mr Kataoka, who sees room to ramp up stimulus, and those who are more worried about the rising cost of prolonged easing such as the strain it inflicts on financial institutions.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [HAKODATE, Japan] Bank of Japan board member Goushi Kataoka advocated a pre-emptive further easing in monetary policy, warning of risks to the inflation outlook and the pain spreading through the economy from the bitter US-China trade war. .
