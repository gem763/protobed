ModCloth is being sold to brand investment platform Go Global Retail in a deal that's expected to close later this year, per CNBC. The sale is likely related to ModCloth's reportedeconomic issues as Walmart is looking to improve the profitability of its e-commerce portfolio.\n\nThe retailer is also looking to spin off its personal shopping startup Jetblack, which launched in May 2018 after being developed by its tech incubator. Jetblack uses personal shoppers and AI to quickly fulfill consumers' orders and had approximately 600 active users this summer, but it's losing $15,000 per consumer annually, The Wall Street Journal reports. These issues, which may be difficult to overcome since they're driven by the combination of Jetblack's promise of fast delivery and low prices, have led Walmart to talk to potential partners and investors \u2014 including Microsoft and UPS \u2014 about investing in the service. The talks, which were first reported in September, are ongoing, but if Walmart does spin off Jetblack, it's expected to keep a stake in the service.\n\nThese moves signify a shift in Walmart's e-commerce strategy as it looks to develop more offerings and improve its profitability. The retailer intends to create brands on its own, differing from the acquisition strategy that brought in ModCloth, Bonobos, Eloquii, and more. This could be a more profitable effort for Walmart since it'll control how the brands operate from creation and can sell their products through any of its channels since it won't have to worry about preexisting brand images.\n\nIt's also launched its own grocery delivery subscription service, which could be expensive to operate, like Jetblack, but because it incentivizes shopping with Walmart it could generate more revenue and prove less costly. As Walmart moves away from ModCloth and Jetblack, it's making new efforts to offer similar value, but with a potentially greater chance to be profitable.\n\nDespite their economic issues and Walmart's interest in moving on from them, acquiring ModCloth and developing Jetblack may have given Walmart information and experience that set it up for future success. Prior to acquiring ModCloth and other digital brands, Walmart had limited experience running a digitally native brand, so its two-plus years of operating ModCloth could've taught it a great deal that might benefit its future efforts. And Jetblack's use of AI, personal shopping, and text-ordering could inform Walmart's use of the same technologies going forward, helping it launch additional innovative services.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
