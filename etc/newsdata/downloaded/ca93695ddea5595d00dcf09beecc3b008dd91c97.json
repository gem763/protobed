His foes couldn\u2019t pry him loose.", "language": "en", "text": "Former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden. | Olivier Douliery/Getty Images 2020 Democratic debates Biden bear-hugged Obama. His foes couldn\u2019t pry him loose. The former VP got one big thing right on the debate stage. And that may be all that mattered.\n\nHistorically, when a former vice president runs for a promotion to the top job, he struggles with the legacy of his former boss. George H. W. Bush was caricatured as a wimp as he tried to step out of Ronald Reagan\u2019s shadow. Al Gore was paralyzed as he tried to embrace Bill Clinton\u2019s popular policies while distancing himself from the sex scandal that led to Clinton\u2019s impeachment. Hillary Clinton faced a similar dynamic in 2008 and 2016, when the former first lady treated her husband\u2019s administration like a buffet, endorsing some of his policies and discarding others.\n\nSo far Biden has had it easier. Barack Obama is the most popular figure in the Democratic Party and Biden embraces the man and his legacy with the kind of affection he previously reserved only for Amtrak or Corvettes. Biden\u2019s campaign message, as a popular joke goes, is often little more than a subject, a verb and Obama\u2019s name. There is none of the psychodrama that consumed Gore. There is none of the picking and choosing that defined Hillary Clinton.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOn Thursday night, when Biden momentarily seemed to slip and suggest that he was less than full-throated in his embrace of Obamaism, specifically about their record on immigration, Julian Castro pounced.\n\n\u201cMy problem with Vice President Biden -- and Cory pointed this out last time -- is every time something good about Barack Obama comes up,\u201d said Castro, who began to mimic Biden, \u201cHe says, \u2018Oh, I was there, I was there, I was there, that's me too!\u2019 And then every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of, he says, \u2018Well, that was the president.\u2019 I mean, he wants to take credit for Obama's work, but not have to answer to any questions.\u201d\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/25/a1/ce1dee70451ab229deac77900923/compilation.png\" true\n\nBiden took the attack as an opportunity to clarify that his loyalty to Obama is unconditional: \u201cI stand with Barack Obama all eight years\u2014good, bad and indifferent.\u201d That might as well be the Biden campaign slogan.\n\nThis strategy, which is often mocked, of hugging Obama like a life preserver through the rapids of the primary has carried Biden far. And Thursday night suggested that trying to break loose Biden\u2019s grip from his Obama raft is still surprisingly difficult for his opponents.\n\nBefore the debate, one top Biden adviser predicted gleefully that there was little percentage for the other candidates in trying to attack aspects of the Obama legacy, even the parts where many on the left believe he wasn\u2019t bold enough. \u201cPeople started down the road where they were going to separate themselves from Obama,\u201d he told me, \u201cand they immediately understood that that is a dead end in the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nThe Houston debate offered a great deal of support for this view. None of the candidates has figured out a way to praise Obama and attack Biden.\n\nIt started with healthcare. Biden himself brought up the issue. \u201cI know that the senator says she's for Bernie,\u201d he said about Elizabeth Warren\u2019s support for Sanders\u2019s Medicare for All proposal. \u201cWell, I'm for Barack. I think Obamacare worked.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/2607/1155968404_6085815684001_6085813667001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nIn response Warren, notably, did not say that Obama wasn\u2019t bold enough when it came to healthcare, an argument that Sanders supporters and others on the left often make. Instead, she argued that she just wanted to build on Obama\u2019s good work.\n\n\u201cWe all owe a huge debt to President Obama,\u201d Warren said, polishing the former president\u2019s halo in Biden-like fashion, \u201cwho fundamentally transformed health care in America and committed this country to health care for every human being. And now the question is: How best can we improve on it?\u201d\n\nHarris said much of the same thing. \u201cI want to give credit to Barack Obama for bringing us this far,\u201d she gushed. \u201cWe wouldn't be here if he didn't have the courage, the talent to see us this far.\u201d\n\nJulian Castro took it a step further, trying to steal for himself the mantle of Obama on the issue by arguing that Biden\u2019s views on healthcare are actually a betrayal of Saint Obama.\n\n\u201cBarack Obama's vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered,\u201d Castro said. \u201cHe wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not. I\u2019m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and you're not.\u201d\n\nBiden, who was sharper and more energetic than the listless person who showed up in the first two debates, had a stinging retort that highlighted the fact that he knows the former president better than anyone else on the stage: \u201cThat will be a surprise to him.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3263/1155968404_6085827928001_6085823265001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nJulian\u2019s brother, Congressman Joaquin Castro, told me after the debate that despite his popularity, Democrats needed to be realistic about Obama\u2019s legacy. \u201cAll of us agree that President Obama was a great president,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can't make our presidents into flawless heroes.\u201d So far this is a minority view.\n\n\u201cPeople are being very careful,\u201d David Axelrod, Obama\u2019s former chief strategist, texted me during an exchange about trade when I asked about the seeming prohibition on attacking Obama.\n\nBy the end of the night, nobody on stage had figured out how to pick the Obama-Biden lock.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama is a towering force in the Democratic Party precisely because of the contrast he provides to Trump, who serves as a constant reminder of the strengths of Obama to every Democrat in the country,\u201d said Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress and a former Clinton and Obama official. \u201cAttacks on Obama backfired in the second debate and I think candidates were wary of delivering them again precisely because they engendered such anger before. While primary opponents can take on Biden's particular record during his service in the Obama administration, it then provides Biden the opportunity to remind people that Obama trusted Biden and he was a partner in the administration. So there are a lot of pitfalls and few rewards for any Democrat to criticize the Obama administration and its record.\u201d\n\nJohn Favreau, Obama\u2019s longtime speechwriter, told me he didn\u2019t think it should be such a challenge. \u201cI\u2019m a hopelessly biased defender of my former boss, but I thought the narrative that the candidates were trashing Obama\u2019s legacy in the last debate was way overblown,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any problem at all with candidates saying, \u2018I think Obama was the best president of our lifetime, but I disagreed with how he handled deportations,\u2019 or \u2018I didn\u2019t support the TPP\u2019 or whatever. And I\u2019m still waiting for one of the Medicare for All candidates to point out that one person who called their plan a good idea was \u2026 Barack Obama! (in 2018).\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSo yeah, it seems like a struggle, but I\u2019m not sure why it should be.\u201d\n\nBut it was. Kamala Harris seemed to sum up the view of the non-Biden candidates on this topic. When asked how her views on trade differed from Obama\u2019s, she was clear and succinct that she had no interest in messing with him.\n\n\u201cI have no criticism of that,\u201d she said.", "description": "The former VP got one big thing right on the debate stage.
