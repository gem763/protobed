For Tuesday, Cramer was bullish on Mastercard (MA) .\n\nIn this daily bar chart of MA, below, we can see that prices have been trading sideways the past five months. MA has spent a fair amount of time the past two months below the declining 50-day moving average line but a downtrend has not taken hold. The rising 200-day moving average is still bullish and below the price action.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has drifted slightly lower the past two months or so telling us there has been some selling.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is just slightly below the zero line but it has crossed to the upside for a cover shorts buy signal. Strength above $280 will probably strengthen this picture.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of MA, below, we can see that prices have not quite tripled over the past three years. Very impressive. MA is trading above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line shows a slight decline over the past two months but it is still not far from making a new high for the move up.\n\nThe weekly MACD oscillator has been in a take profits sell mode from early August.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of MA, below, we can see a strong uptrend and a much higher price target.\n\nBottom line strategy: MA has tested the $260 area several times and prices have not broken lower, telling us that the path of least resistance is probably going to be up. Approach MA from the long side.", "description": "Let's review the charts to see if the 'chip' will be up or down....MA", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Mastercard Refuses To Break To The Downside So Get Ready For Higher Prices", "Let'S Review The Charts To See If The 'Chip' Will Be Up Or Down.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Eric Jhonsa", "Jim Cramer", "Bob Lang", "Gary Berman"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/mastercardcircles.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
