REUTERS/Florence Lo\n\nYi Gang, the governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, said in a statement to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s steering committee that Beijing is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d in the IMF\u2019s failure to realign its shareholding structure to recognise the rising influence of China and other fast-growing economies.\n\nYi pushed back against the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Aug. 5 designation of China as a currency manipulator after China\u2019s yuan fell below the psychologically important level of 7 to the dollar.\n\nHis statement said that the depreciation in the yuan since the beginning of August has been driven by market forces, including volatility prompted by escalating trade tensions. Yi added that there was \u201cgrowing market acceptance for two-way exchange rate fluctuations\u201d in the yuan, also known as the renminbi or RMB.\n\n\u201cJudging both from economic fundamentals and from market supply and demand, the RMB exchange rate is at an appropriate level,\u201d Yi said.\n\nIn a dig at the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d trade stance, Yi said: \u201cthe wave of populism and protectionism in some countries has undermined mutual trust, reducing their willingness to cooperate on a multilateral basis.\u201d\n\nYi\u2019s statement did not mention the \u201cPhase 1\u201d trade deal that U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Oct. 11, but warned of the problems that trade tensions have caused for the global economy.\n\n\u201cSigns of disruptions have emerged in global trade and in global industry chains, supply chains, and value chains,\u201d he said. \u201cTrade tensions have dampened market confidence, which may amplify financial market volatility and drag down economic growth.\u201d\n\nOn IMF quotas, Yi said that IMF members needed to honour previous commitments to adjust the IMF\u2019s shareholding to reflect the growing power of dynamic emerging market economies and said that China supported an adequately resourced IMF based on quota resources, not temporary lending arrangements.\n\nThe IMF on Friday announced that members had agreed to keep IMF lending resources at $1 trillion, through extension and a doubling of its crisis lending fund and a corresponding reduction in bilateral borrowing arrangements. But in a move that preserves U.S. veto power over major Fund decisions for four more years, IMF members delayed the next quota review until December 2023.\n\n\u201cThe failure to adjust quota shares undermines the representation, governance, and legitimacy of the IMF,\u201d Yi said. \u201cChina will, along with the other parties, continue to push for reforms of the IMF\u2019s quotas that will strengthen the voice and representation of emerging market economies.\u201d", "description": "China's top central banker said on Saturday that potential escalation of trade tensions and policy uncertainty were the major risk factors facing the world economy, and market forces were keeping China's yuan at an appropriate level.", "authors": ["David Lawder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1442828805&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0MW", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
