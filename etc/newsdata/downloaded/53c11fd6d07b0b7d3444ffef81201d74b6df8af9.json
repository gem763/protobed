Earlier Mr Trump called the protests \"riots\" that were a matter for China to deal with.\n\nThe vandalism started in the evening. Police have responded to violence over 14 weeks with water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas.\n\nRiot police cleared the Central MTR metro station, near Sunday's march, where activists smashed a long glass panel at a station entrance and other windows and daubed graffiti on the walls outside. Several arrests were made.\n\nActivists dug up bricks from pathways to break windows and set fires from cardboard boxes on the streets, building barricades with metal fencing.\n\nHundreds of others milled about surrounding streets lined with banks, jewellery shops and top-brand shopping arcades.\n\nMTR stations have been attacked recently because of televised scenes of police beating protesters on a train on Aug 31 as they cowered on the floor. Protesters are demanding the MTR hands over CCTV footage of the beatings.\n\n\"With the US locked in a trade war with China at this point in time, it's a good opportunity for us to show (the United States) how the pro-China groups are also violating human rights in Hong Kong and allowing police brutality,\" said Cherry, 26, who works in the financial industry, as protesters marched towards the nearby US Consulate.\n\n\"We want the US administration to help protect human rights in Hong Kong.\"\n\nHong Kong returned to China under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland. Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding that autonomy.\n\nChina denies the accusation of meddling and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests, accusing the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest, and warned of the damage to the economy.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced concessions this week aimed at ending the protests, including formally scrapping a hugely unpopular extradition bill, which ignited the unrest in June. Many protesters said it was too little, too late.\n\nThe bill would have allowed the extradition of people to mainland China to stand trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party. Hong Kong has an independent judiciary dating back to British rule.\n\nBut the demonstrations have long since broadened into calls for democracy.\n\nUS legislation addressing China's actions in Hong Kong will be among the top priorities pushed by Senate Democrats when Congress returns to work after a recess next week, their leader, Senator Chuck Schumer, said on Thursday.\n\nMr Schumer urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican who sets the floor agenda, to bring up a bipartisan bill that would require an annual justification of the special treatment afforded by Washington to Hong Kong, including special trade and business privileges, under the US Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992.\n\nThe legislation, called the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, would also mandate that officials in China and Hong Kong who have undermined the city's autonomy are vulnerable to sanctions.\n\nProtesters, in their petition, urged that it be passed in full.\n\nJoshua Wong, one of the leaders of the pro-democracy \"Umbrella\" movement five years ago, was re-arrested at the airport on Sunday on return from Germany and the United States for breaching bail conditions, he said.\n\nHe had been charged with inciting and participating in an unauthorised assembly outside police headquarters on June 21 and released on bail.\n\n\"Preliminary legal advice suggested that the court had acknowledged and approved my trips to Germany and the US when it granted bail on Aug 30,\" he said in a statement. \"Therefore, it is believed that there are some mistakes have been made on the bail certificate.\"\n\nHe said he thought he would be freed on Monday.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [HONG KONG] Thousands of Hong Kong protesters on Sunday sang the Star Spangled Banner and called on US President Donald Trump to \"liberate\" the Chinese-ruled city, the latest in a series of sometimes violent protests to rock the territory. .
