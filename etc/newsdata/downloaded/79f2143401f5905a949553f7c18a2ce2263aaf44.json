There was a non-tropical swirl of clouds well east of Bermuda and a weak, broad area of showers and thunderstorms over the western Caribbean Sea. (NOAA/GOES-East)\n\nOne such area is a storm located southeast of the New England coast, which has strengthened some Thursday night. Should it continue to gather tropical characteristics into Saturday, it could briefly become a subtropical storm.\n\nMore long-term, meteorologists are also watching areas in the Caribbean and off the coast of Africa over the next week for possible tropical trouble.\n\nTropical disturbances, or tropical waves, continue to move westward off the coast of Africa every three days or so.\n\nThese waves make up the Cabo Verde season, which is named for the disturbances that originate near the Cabo Verde Islands just off the west coast of Africa.\n\nEven though we are past the peak of the Cabo Verde season and the hurricane season in general, these disturbances and other areas can still evolve into tropical depressions, storms and hurricanes over time.\n\n\"A somewhat stronger tropical wave is forecast to move off the Africa coast this weekend and move westward,\" Kottlowski said.\n\n\"There is a low chance this becomes an organized system next week,\" he added.\n\nThere remains a broad area of weak counterclockwise winds over the western Caribbean and Central America. This feature is called a gyre.\n\nOccasionally, as tropical waves move into this gyre, they have a greater chance at becoming a tropical depression or storm, since there is extra moisture in place and there already is a weak circulation to begin with.\n\n\"As a result, the area from the western Caribbean to Central America, including adjacent eastern Pacific waters, could give birth to a tropical system or two through next week,\" Kottlowski said.\n\n\"However, the chance of tropical storm formation is probably significantly higher on the Pacific side as opposed to the Caribbean side,\" Kottlowski added.\n\nHurricane season continues until the end of November, and Kottlowski feels there will be another named system or two over the Atlantic Ocean before the season comes to a close.\n\nDownload the free AccuWeather app to see the exact forecast for your area.
