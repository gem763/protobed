different sort of motivation.\u201d\n\nJohnson-Thompson, nominated for the IAAF World Athlete of the Year award, is bidding to become the third British Olympic heptathlon champion.\n\nShe hopes to follow in the footsteps of 2000 winner Denise Lewis and Jessica Ennis-Hill, who won at London 2012, and admitted the two former champions have been major influences on her progress.\n\n\u201cBoth Jess and Denise have been vital in my development and motivation and inspiration to do those performances,\u201d said Johnson-Thompson.\n\n\u201cDenise travelled to France when I was looking for a coach in 2016, we travelled to different countries trying to find a coach together.\n\n\u201cAnd obviously with Jess, I was there in 2012 when she got that British record. That inspired me beyond belief.\n\n\u201cI was only 19 years old at the time and to see that happen first-hand was a huge inspiration, I was like, \u2018I want that in the future,\u2019 and I\u2019m just happy and grateful that I was able to put those results down on the track.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Great Britain\u2019s world heptathlon champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson has played down the notion that she is favourite for Olympic gold at Tokyo 2020.", "authors": ["Alex Pattle"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/04/07/Katarina-Johnson-Thompson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
