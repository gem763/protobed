REUTERS/Thilo Schmuelgen\n\nUniper and Fortum have had a strained relationship since the Finnish state-owned company launched a takeover bid for the German group in 2017 which Uniper opposed.\n\nIn October, state-controlled Finnish utility Fortum agreed to buy a stake of more than 20.5% in Uniper, which would bring its total holding to more than 70.5%.\n\nBut the purchase is subject to Russian regulatory approval due to a strategic water license operated by the German group\u2019s Russian subsidiary Unipro (UPRO.MM).\n\n\u201cThe company registered water supply activities at Surgutskaya GRES-2 as a natural monopoly on (its) own initiative after we announced our offer to buy Uniper shares,\u201d Lundmark told Kommersant.\n\nLundmark said Fortum had discussed the issue with the Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia, and the regulator is considering Fortum\u2019s application to buy the stake.\n\nUniper declined to comment.\n\nUniper\u2019s Russian business Unipro considers classifying further assets in Russia as strategic, Interfax cited a Unipro official as saying on Thursday.\n\nUnipro sees obstacles to a Fortum acquisition at all of its five power stations in Russia, the Unipro official said.\n\nFortum said in a separate statement it expected to close the deal by the end of the first quarter in 2020. Lundmark also said Fortum would seek to chair Uniper\u2019s supervisory board once the deal closed.\n\nUniper said earlier this month that Fortum had yet to address a range of questions about its intentions in the takeover talks to get management support for any deal.", "description": "Uniper deliberately obstructed Fortum's proposed purchase of a stake in the German utility by registering assets in Russia as strategic, Kommersant daily quoted Fortum CEO Pekka Lundmark as saying on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444446286&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0R3", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
