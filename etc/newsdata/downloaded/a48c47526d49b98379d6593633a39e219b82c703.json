Reproductive cloning of animals transplants nuclei from body cells into eggs that have had their nucleus removed. That egg is then stimulated to divide using an electrical charge and is implanted into the uterus of a female.\n\nTherapeutic Cloning is the process where nuclear transplantation of a patient's own cells makes an oocyte from which immune-compatible cells (especially is the process where nuclear transplantation of a patient's own cells makes an oocyte from which immune-compatible cells (especially stem cells ) can be derived for transplant. These cells are stimulated to divide and are grown in a Petri dish rather than in the uterus.\n\nGene Cloning creates copies of genes or DNA fragments. Gene cloning is the most common form of cloning performed by researches at the National Human Genome Research Institute. Genes are cloned for scientists to study in a laboratory setting.\n\nTimeline:\n\n1952 - Scientists demonstrate they can remove the nucleus from a frog's egg, replace it with the nucleus of an embryonic frog cell, and get the egg to develop into a tadpole.", "description": "Read CNN's Cloning Fast Facts and learn more about the process of creating a genetically identical copy of an original.", "authors": ["Cnn Library"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130717152632-famous-pregnancies-dolly-story-top.jpg"}
