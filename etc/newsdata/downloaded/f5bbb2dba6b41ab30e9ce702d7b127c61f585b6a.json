I\u2019m a combat veteran and a former Army pilot who flew missions in Iraq.\n\nAnyone who\u2019s ever served in this region can tell you the beyond catastrophic consequences that are sure to arise if the bond between the U.S. and our local partners is broken.\n\nOver the past five years, American troops stood shoulder to shoulder with the Kurds, retaking ISIS\u2019 caliphate inch by inch, foot by foot, town by town.\n\nAnd in the process, they became our brothers and sisters in arms.\n\nThey bled for us.\n\nThey died for us.\n\nThey did the unimaginable on-the-ground work of fighting ISIS face-to-face\u2014work that no one else in the world wanted to do.\n\nYet now\u2026 maybe because of cowardice, maybe because of corruption, maybe both\u2026 Trump has broken America\u2019s solemn promise to those who\u2019ve sacrificed so much on our behalf, choosing to pander to an autocrat and clear the way for a Turkish offensive that has already left more of our allies dead and destabilized the entire region.\n\nAnd as the situation on the ground continues to deteriorate with every passing hour, he keeps lying to the American people.\n\nHe keeps trying to minimize and hide the true horrors of what he has let happen.\n\nSo let me tell you the truth:\n\nIn the days since Trump\u2019s decision, Bashar al-Assad has consolidated his brutal rule over swaths of northern Syria, while Russia has strode back into the region, filling the power vacuum we left behind.\n\nOur own troops have been shelled by Turkey, while we\u2019ve likely lost the trust of any human intelligence assets in the region who once would\u2019ve worked with the United States.\n\nMore than 100 ISIS fighters have broken out of prisons that Trump all but physically unlocked\u2026 leading to real fears of a resurgent ISIS and greater odds that we\u2019ll have to send troops back into northern Iraq to re-wage war over feet of sand that we\u2019d previously won\u2026 trying to beat back the resurgent group along with newly-emboldened Iranian proxies.\n\nAll of this happened in just the past couple of weeks\u2026 and all of it is because of Trump\u2019s reckless decision to abandon our Kurdish allies.\n\nNone of these outcomes puts America first.\n\nNone of these outcomes makes America great again.\n\nThey all weaken our standing on the global stage\u2014and worse than that, they make our nation less safe.\n\nThe list of consequences for our nation goes on and on, just as the list of fatalities will, as anyone who\u2019s ever commanded a military unit will tell you that troops beyond Syria will be in graver danger as well because of the president\u2019s incompetence.\n\nAfter all, who would want to partner with us now that they know that one phone call could convince Trump to sell them out to their enemies?\n\nWho would want to follow in the Kurds\u2019 footsteps, losing thousands of their bravest, only to be betrayed\u2014left to die without a second thought?\n\nIf I were a Division Commander or Special Operations Commander right now, I would have spent the past few days brushing off my operational plans\u2026 because with no ally around to help shoulder our burden, we\u2019ll have no choice but to send more American troops when ISIS regroups and raises their black-and-white yet flag once again.\n\nWith one decision\u2026 without any clear reason why\u2026 without any plan to deal with the fallout\u2026 Trump shredded our credibility, wrecked our foreign policy and endangered both today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s troops.\n\nSo now, we\u2019re at a turning point.\n\nThe stakes are climbing higher every day, with more Kurds dying, more ISIS prisoners escaping, more children fleeing, and Russia and Iran gaining more power with each tick of the clock.\n\nBipartisan congressional majorities have spent the past two weeks pleading with President Trump to reverse the course he\u2019s set us on. But it\u2019s up to the president to stop trying to justify his bad decision and simply do the right thing.\n\nHe needs to set aside his ego and actually work with Congress, our allies and the players in the region to come up with a long-term solution to piece back together the equilibrium he chose to shatter.\n\nBecause I\u2019m tired of Trump wrapping himself in the flag in the morning then abandoning our troops and our values by the afternoon.\n\nHe has put our country, and the world, at a crossroads.\n\nSo in this moment, he\u2019d do well to show even an ounce of the bravery that our Kurdish partners have shown and start protecting American interests rather than ceding them to whichever autocrat calls him next.\u201d", "description": "During Friday's Democratic Weekly Address, Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) stated that \"maybe because of cowardice, maybe because of corruption, maybe | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Duckworth-1025-Thumbnail-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
