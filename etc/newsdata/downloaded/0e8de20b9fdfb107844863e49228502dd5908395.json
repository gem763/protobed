That's probably good for the economy \u2014 but there are some serious downsides, too.\n\nMachines are expected to displace about 20 million manufacturing jobs across the world over the next decade, according to a report released Wednesday by Oxford Economics , a global forecasting and quantitative analysis firm.\n\nThat means about 8.5% of the global manufacturing workforce could be displaced by robots. The report also notes that the move to robots tends to generate new jobs as fast as it automates them, however it could contribute to income inequality.\n\nThe use of robots is on the rise: At this point, every new robot that is installed displaces 1.6 manufacturing workers on average, according to the Oxford Economics model.\n\nAutomation isn't a new trend in manufacturing, of course. The automotive industry, for example, used 43% of the robots in the world in 2016.\n\nRead More", "description": "Robots are getting better at doing human jobs.
