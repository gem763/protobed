He was rushed to a hospital where he later died, said Marcus Jones, the acting Montgomery County Police chief, at a news conference.\n\nJones identified the officer as Thomas J. Bomba, 38, a 13-year veteran of the department who was assigned to the 3rd District.\n\n\"Officer Bomba was a very dedicated officer who worked in downtown Silver Spring,\" Jones said. \"We have typically been made aware of many different types of crimes that occur in downtown and Officer Bomba always been actively involved on patrol and addressing a lot of the concerns that have occurred in downtown Silver Spring.\"\n\nOFFICERS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY IN 2019\n\nThe incident spawned a massive police response in Silver Spring, with aerial images showing dozens of police vehicles in the parking garage where the shooting unfolded.\n\nTactical teams and officers also were seen sweeping different levels of the garage. No suspects have been detained and no descriptions of possible suspects were available, Jones said.\n\nAt an earlier media briefing, Montgomery County Police Captain Thomas Jordan said, \"to describe this as an all-hands-on-deck operation would be an understatement.\"\n\nJones said the case was being investigated as a homicide, but he also said there was no indication of an \"ongoing\" public safety threat.\n\nHe said Bomba was wearing a body camera at the time of the shooting but was not sure if it had been activated. The officer's weapon turned up at the scene but it was not clear if he returned fire, Jones told reporters.\n\nInvestigators were working with nearby businesses with surveillance cameras to see if any recorded the shooting, Jones said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSome roads in the area were closed to traffic and students at several schools were sheltering in place earlier Monday, Fox 5 reported.\n\nBomba left behind a wife and two children.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A police officer in Maryland\u00a0died\u00a0Monday morning after he was discovered shot in a parking garage just outside the nation's capital, officials said.", "authors": ["Travis Fedschun", "Travis Fedschun Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
