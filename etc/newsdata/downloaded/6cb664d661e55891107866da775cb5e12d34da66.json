We only win when we are together,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nUnlike Xhaka Chelsea\u2019s Christian Pulisic enjoyed a memorable weekend in the best senses of the term scoring a hat-trick \u2014 his first goals for the club and a small initial repayment on the \u00a358 million they paid Borussia Dortmund for him.\n\nIt was only his second start for the club since his arrival in August and the 21-year-old United States star should get another run out on Wednesday against Manchester United.\n\nAnd that is certainly something he would relish.\n\n\u201c(Frank Lampard the Chelsea manager) believes in me and he\u2019s told me that,\u201d said Pulisic.\n\n\u201cYou have to keep working hard in training and earn my spot, that\u2019s how it is at the highest level.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to continue to do so. This is hopefully just the start.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Never show our faces\u2019 \u2013\n\nLampard, who succeeded Maurizio Sarri as manager after just one season with Derby County in the second tier Championship, is delighted with the form of the team but warned his players not to get all comfortable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just really pleased where we\u2019ve got to,\u201d Lampard told the club website.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working hard, but we have to be aware we can improve and if we get overconfident in this moment and start making crazy expectations on ourselves from within \u2013- let everyone else talk.\u201d\n\nManchester United have for them hit a rich vein of form beginning with the 1-1 draw with Liverpool the weekend before last \u2014 the only club to take points form the leaders this term.\n\nTwo rare away wins have followed with Sunday\u2019s 3-1 victory over Norwich their first in the Premier League in eight months.\n\nChelsea represents a far tougher challenge away from home but United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says they go to Stamford Bridge armed with two priceless qualities.\n\n\u201cIt gives the players confidence and momentum,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\nOn Tuesday Southampton meanwhile will bid to redeem themselves after their 9-0 humiliation by Leicester.\n\nThe only problem for the Saints is the obstacle they must overcome are the holders Manchester City.\n\n\u201cWe can put quotes out, apologise and say something, but the only thing that\u2019s the real deal now is actions,\u201d Saints captain Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg said according to the Southern Daily Echo.\n\n\u201cActions that are nowhere near what they were against Leicester. We can never show our faces like this again.\u201d\n\npi/cw", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Arsenal would probably have preferred an easier League Cup opponent than Premier League leaders Liverpool as they bid to regroup", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/6aeb4c_liverpool-entertain-an-arsenal-undergoing-bit-crisis-in-fourth-league-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
