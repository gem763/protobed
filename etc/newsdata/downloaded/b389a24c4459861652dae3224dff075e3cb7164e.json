It\u2019s not even a question at this point. It\u2019s just a fact. For the greatest artist in human existence to put a red hat on was God\u2019s practical joke to all liberals.\u201d\n\nDespite the album\u2019s so-called \u201clukewarm\u201d reception, it seems the rapper\u2019s pivot to gospel music has done little to deter his fans. Multiple tracks from the 11-track album have sat within the U.S. Spotify chart\u2019s top 10 in the days following its release, and \u201cFollow God\u201d has topped the U.S. charts every day since its release.\n\nTwitter users were less than impressed by Trump Jr.\u2019s interest in reviewing music:\n\nPretty sad that only people with rich parents can afford to do music criticism these days. https://t.co/kvb02pAxqw \u2014 Steven Hyden (@Steven_Hyden) October 29, 2019\n\nMos Def taught us about state surveillance, Dead Prez warned us about American greed, Kweli rapped about police brutality, Killer Mike told us about Reagan, Immortal Technique gave us a blueprint for the revolution...\n\n\n\nKanye West said slavery was a choice.\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udd21 https://t.co/tYSBMoT65f \u2014 Ryan McKinnell (@RyanMcKinnell) October 29, 2019\n\njust gonna leave this right here in case this still the hill y'all wanna die on https://t.co/b3auTRHKcV \u2014 ian (@GALDYTRON) October 29, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s praise for Kanye\u2019s album is a great reminder to pay attention to who is hyping your work.
