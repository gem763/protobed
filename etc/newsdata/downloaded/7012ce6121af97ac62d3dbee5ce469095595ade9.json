The company brushed off the offer in an email Sunday, saying that selling the assets to the city wouldn\u2019t be \u201cin the best interests of our customers and stakeholders.\u201d The company is, meanwhile, due to file a restructuring plan in bankruptcy court by Monday.\n\nThe proposal, which the city had been weighing for months, may complicate PG&E\u2019s efforts to line up financing and craft a plan that would allow it to exit the largest utility bankruptcy in U.S. history by next year. The company was forced to file for Chapter 11 in January to deal with an estimated $30 billion in liabilities tied to devastating wildfires that its equipment ignited in 2017 and 2018.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to solve a big financing gap, and this could help them do that,\u201d said Barbara Hale, assistant general manager for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission.\n\nPG&E has been floating a plan that would instead have it raising billions of dollars in debt and equity to cover its wildfire liabilities. But its efforts are already facing setbacks. On Friday, the company\u2019s bid to get tax-free, state bonds to help cover its liabilities failed in the state legislature.\n\nPG&E and San Francisco, meanwhile, have a long history of disputes, with the city accusing the utility of hampering the development of several infrastructure projects. Breed and San Francisco\u2019s city attorney had a meeting scheduled with PG&E Chief Executive Officer Bill Johnson later this month to discuss their issues, and Breed plans to discuss the offer, too, according to her letter, which was reported earlier by the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nPG&E said in its statement that it would \u201cremain open to communication\u201d on the offer but cast doubt on the prospects of a sale. It marked the second time in a week that the company appeared to rebuff an offer for some of its equipment. A rural irrigation district that has tried for years to obtain PG&E\u2019s local wires on Monday offered the company $116 million. The company dismissed it as too low.\n\nSan Francisco estimated that its offer is 35 times PG&E\u2019s estimated 2019 earnings for the assets and described it as \u201ca very attractive premium valuation\u201d considering the company\u2019s bankruptcy and other recent utility takeovers. The city said it would issue power revenue bonds through the utility commission and expand the agency\u2019s operations to include the assets.\n\nA labor union representing PG&E workers has opposed any public takeover of private utilities, saying it would harm employee pensions and other benefits.\n\nLabor Woes\n\n\u201cWe oppose San Francisco\u2019s offer for that reason,\u201d Tom Dalzell, business manager for the union\u2019s local unit, said by email. \u201cIt is our opinion that the offer is extremely low, that San Francisco is probably not capable of running a complex network, and that the city has many pressing problems that should take priority over buying electric system.\u201d\n\nHale, in turn, said the city has been talking with unions in an effort to ease their fears. \u201cWe know that they have knowledge and skills unique to operating this system,\u201d she said. San Francisco would recruit PG&E employees.\n\nThe city said it believes it could finance the deal and run the system for the next 30 years at rates equal to, or less than, PG&E\u2019s current rates.\n\nThe city has hired several advisers including Jefferies LLC, MRW & Associates and Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP.\n\n(Updates with bonds setback in fifth paragraph)\n\n--With assistance from Jim Silver.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: David R.
