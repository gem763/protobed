(@Dhruv7491/Twitter)\n\nThe TSB also singled out Enbridge's use of polyethylene tape on its pipelines, writing \"this type of coating has a tendency to separate (disbond) from the pipeline, allowing moisture present in the soil to contact the pipe surface.\"\n\nThe cause of the explosion itself has not been released.\n\nA spokesperson for the Transportation Safety Board said a full report into the explosion \u2014 along with recommendations \u2014 will be published by early January 2020.\n\nEnbridge increases inspections\n\nIn an emailed response to CBC, Enbridge said it has increased the frequency of its pipeline inspections and has already conducted system-wide checks for other corrosion.\n\n\"By November 2019, we will have nearly doubled the number of dig inspections undertaken in a typical maintenance year,\" the email reads. \"This work goes well beyond industry standards.\"\n\nLawyer Malcolm Macpherson is representing Lheidli T'enneh in the lawsuit against Enbridge. (Andrew Kurjata/CBC)\n\nLheidli T'enneh pursuing legal action\n\nMeanwhile, the Lheidli T'enneh First Nation is pursuing legal action against Enbridge, seeking financial compensation for damages, nuisance and trespass.\n\nIn its notice of civil claim, the Nation says the explosion caused \"serious and constant distress and anguish\" for Lheidli T'enneh members and that Enbridge has failed to adequately communicate the cause of the explosion and its aftermath.\n\nThe notice also argues Lheidli T'enneh never gave the company permission to build on its unceded land, and asks for a permanent injunction preventing Enbridge from operating on their territory and reserves, and to immediately dismantle and remove existing pipeline infrastructure.\n\nPhyllis Seymour, a member of the Lheidli T'enneh First Nation, described witnessing the pipeline explosion as 'traumatic.' (Rafferty Baker/CBC)\n\nIn legal documents filed in response to the Lheidli T'enneh lawsuit, Enbridge says the civil claim \"lacks merit\" and \"is an abuse of process and collateral attack.\" The company says it \"acted in good faith to accommodate and support Lheidli T'enneh\" following the explosion and the First Nation should not be entitled to damages or compensation.\n\nIn an emailed response to CBC, Enbridge said that the natural gas pipeline \u2014 which is a major supplier to customers in the Lower Mainland \u2014 is a critical piece of provincial infrastructure, used to heat homes, hospitals, schools, businesses and industry, and that it has operated safely for more than 60 years.\n\nThe company says that it has been open with the Lheidli T'enneh about the process, and that it is \"always interested in strengthening our relationship with Indigenous communities.\"\n\n\"At Enbridge, no incident is ever acceptable,\" the email says. \"Our goal is to continually improve the safety of our pipeline systems.\"\n\nListen to an interview with Malcolm Macpherson, the lawyer representing Lheidli T'enneh:\n\nIt was one year ago today that a natural gas pipeline exploded near Prince George. Now, the people who live near that pipeline are still waiting for answers about what went wrong, and the Lheidli T'enneh First Nation is taking legal action against Enbridge. 9:05\n\nSubscribe to Daybreak North on CBC Listen or your favourite podcast app, and connect with CBC Northern British Columbia on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.", "description": "It was Oct. 9, 2018, when an orange fireball was seen shooting into the air near Prince George, rocking homes on nearby Lheidli T'enneh reserve land.
