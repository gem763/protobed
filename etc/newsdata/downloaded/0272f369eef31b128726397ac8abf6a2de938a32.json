Benji Travis\n\n1. Figure out what value your videos will provide\n\nThe first thing creators should do is know what value they're going to offer the audience and start small. Focus on the first 1,000 people you're going to reach. That'll create a niche audience. For example, if you were going to start a gardening channel, you might narrow in on first-time homeowners.\n\nNext, decide on the length of your content. Will they be short tutorials or deeper dives?\n\n2. Decide on a frequency and stick to it\n\nLike a TV show, you want to be consistent so you establish a connection with your audience. Travis said he recommended people publish at least once a week \u2014 with the caveat that they shouldn't sacrifice quality for quantity.\n\n\"You've got to commit to something, and consistency is key,\" he said.\n\nTravis and his wife vlog their daily lives on their YouTube channel ItsJudysLife. Benji Travis\n\n3. Study the data and learn from your results\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes people make is not continually improving their videos, Travis said. He recommends looking at metrics like comments, likes, views, retention, and click-through rates, a measure of how many people see your video thumbnail and click on it.\n\nIf you put out a 10-minute video, how much of that video is the average audience looking at? Travis said 70% was a good figure to strive for.\n\n\"What you want to do is try to hold your audience's attention for as long as possible,\" he said.\n\nThe Video Influencers YouTube channel has 532,000 subscribers. Video Influencers/YouTube\n\n4. Sweat the details\n\nGetting people to watch and return for more means focusing on the details.\n\n\"You're always trying to deliver more value in each video you upload,\" he said.\n\nThis could mean buying a good camera and improving things like the lighting, title, and thumbnail, the image people see when they come across your video, he said. Your title should be compelling and represent what's in your video. Free websites like PicMonkey can create an image that will make people want to click through.\n\nFor more on how influencers are profiting from their success online, according to industry professionals and creators, check out these Business Insider Prime posts:", "description": "Benji Travis shares four tips on how to get enough subscribers to become eligible for YouTube's ad-monetization program.", "authors": ["Amanda Perelli"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8e72c82e22af27166d0662?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
