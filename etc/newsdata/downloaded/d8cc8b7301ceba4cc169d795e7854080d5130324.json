II", "language": "en", "text": "TAC commenters are the best commenters. Thank you for all of you who offered thoughtful input and commentary on my last piece regarding the church and declining attendance.\n\nHere are some responses to those comments\u2014because they offered excellent food for thought, and I wanted to give some deeper thought to them. 1,000-or-so-word blog posts aren\u2019t adequate to address the depth and complexity of the issues the U.S. church is facing, and it\u2019s worth considering these issues in greater detail. So without further ado, here\u2019s a look at some of the main objections I received Wednesday:\n\nIt\u2019s About Catechesis, Not Community\n\nThis is true to some extent: don\u2019t go to a heretical church, even if it\u2019s just across the street. Don\u2019t abandon doctrine or orthodoxy in your efforts to connect with a body of believers. When referring to \u201cdenominational difference\u201d in the original piece, I was referring more to minor issues of worship or layout than core doctrinal considerations. If we\u2019re considering two churches that are both Bible-preaching and doctrinally sound, then choosing between them becomes a matter of other, more gray issues: such as location, size, and communal integration.\n\nBecause we\u2019re discussing this issue in the public sphere, and because logistics are what people pinpoint as keeping them from church on Sundays, I think it\u2019s important not to simply say, \u201cThe right doctrine and sound preaching will keep people in the pews.\u201d It should\u2014that\u2019s true. We would hope that, as one commenter points out, \u201cthe Church that preaches repentance and hope\u201d would draw and keep a congregation. It\u2019s about the Gospel, first and foremost.\n\nBut if people say that they are \u201ctoo busy, have a crazy work schedule,\u201d or are \u201ctoo lazy\u201d to attend church, it could also be that they need physical checks and balances (such as church proximity and member connectedness) to get them out the front door on Sundays. This isn\u2019t unspiritual or belittling of doctrine: it\u2019s an acknowledgment of the sinful proclivities of our nature, and the need for support and accountability.\n\nIn her book Got Religion?, Naomi Schaefer Riley considers millennials\u2019 abdication of church (as well as the synagogue and mosque, which have also seen a decline in attendance). Many of the deterrents she pinpoints are social and communal: if a young person\u2019s friends leave the church, they are likely to leave, as well. \u201cWhen a group of friends who are coreligionists starts to dissipate, the religious observance starts to fall off,\u201d writes Riley. \u201cPracticing a faith does not, on its surface, seem like a team sport. There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t go to synagogue or church alone. But people don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThankfully, this isn\u2019t a temptation for everyone. One commenter said, \u201cWe attend a Church that is 40+ miles from our home, passing roughly eight others on our way. It takes up approximately 4-5 hours of any Sunday. It\u2019s where we feel the focus is where it should be and the liturgy is delivered in it\u2019s purest form.\u201d\n\nWhen you have the conviction and church allegiance necessary to attend church 40 or 50 miles away, that becomes a salutary and acceptable practice. Geographic and logistical concerns are more important for people who find it difficult to \u201cstick\u201d with a church, and need some extra accountability.\n\nThis plays into the \u201ccommunal\u201d aspect of a church, as well. Fruit is important\u2014as so many commenters pointed out, there are a lot of Christian churches out there that have produced bad fruit, and it\u2019s debilitated or decimated the faith of many. But let\u2019s not forget that church isn\u2019t a social club or humanitarian nonprofit: it is, first and foremost, the church. We should not become so focused on the political or social (or geographical) facets of our faith, that we lose sight of the deeper philosophical and theological truths necessary for a church to thrive. \u201cChurch shopping\u201d is symptomatic of someone looking for a laundry list of experiences or services that they think it ought to provide. But church is meant to be more serious, more metaphysical than this: church is meant to delve into the deepest subjects, the ones that have to do not just with this world, but with the next.\n\nDon\u2019t Pick On The Megachurches\n\nOne commenter said: \u201cMany megachurches actually do the \u2018personal, communal\u2019 thing better that smaller churches by having really good small group ministry. Sunday morning becomes a kind of modern version of big, cathedral Christianity with small groups filling the need for smaller, communal groups (many of which are often geographically-centered) during the week.\u201d\n\nI hadn\u2019t thought of it this way: perhaps the \u201cmegachurch\u201d is the best evangelical response to an absence of the awe-inspiring beauty and reverent ethos offered by a cathedral. It gives members that sense of collective solidarity, along with an impression of towering greatness and beauty. That said, it seems that without the ancient, embodied rituals of the cathedral, a megachurch cannot offer the same depth and lasting reverence that a cathedral can. It may be able to foster some emotional goods via its inspiring service, but whether these responses will blossom into lasting devotion and discipleship is difficult to know.\n\nIt isn\u2019t fair to disparage all megachurches. But there are some interesting findings worth considering for people who want to worship there: the Hartford Institute for Religious Research reports that people who attend megachurches are most often younger, single, wealthier, and have a higher level of education. Most attending a megachurch have been doing so for five years or less, and 45 percent of the church\u2019s members never volunteer. While social and communal outreach programs exist, the Hartford Institute found that these are largely set up to help members \u201ccraft unique, customized spiritual experiences\u201d by providing a \u201cmultitude of ministry choices and diverse avenues for involvement.\u201d\n\nThese words\u2014a \u201cunique, customized spiritual experience\u201d\u2014are symptomatic of, I would argue, one of the biggest problems with modern Christianity. They\u2019re indicative of a consumer church, one that\u2019s set up more like a Build-a-Bear Workshop than as a body of united and serious believers. Members are likely to fall prey to what Rod Dreher has called \u201cMoralistic Therapeutic Deism\u201d: asking what their church will do for them, how it will appeal to their needs and wants and desires, and not really committing themselves to the truths of the Gospel or the demands of Christ.\n\nIn January, Jonathan Aigner shared some of his reasons for disliking megachurch worship services. Focused on the experiential and personal, he said, they do little to foster the unity of their congregants or the longevity of their faith. Worship, he argued, is \u201cabout unity, not choice. It\u2019s about Holy Scripture, not self-help. It\u2019s about theology, not experience. It\u2019s about participation, not consumption. It\u2019s about liturgy, not jesusy entertainment.\u201d\n\nA megachurch that accomplishes the former without falling prey to the latter is defying the stereotypes and tendencies of its brand, and will (hopefully) overcome the difficulties of size and potential alienation to build a strong, healthy membership.\n\nThe Damage of Scandal\n\nAs one commenter put it,\n\nPeople who call themselves Christians and publicly proclaim their love for the Lamb of God and Prince of Peace and then treat defenseless kids with stern cruelty are not a good advertisement for their beliefs. People who spend millions of dollars to make themselves more comfortable for an hour or so each Sunday and no money on local people who might need help are not a good advertisement for their beliefs. People who act as church leaders and commit crimes or cover up for others who commit them are not a good advertisement for their beliefs. \u2026 These people either have never read the Sermon on the Mount or, if they have read it, they have rejected it.\n\nThis is so true, and such an enormous problem to face. Rod Dreher has written well on this subject before, as he spent a lot of time researching and writing about the Catholic church\u2019s child sex abuse crisis. He knows firsthand how faith-crushing such horrific evil can be.\n\nThis is why I did emphasize a loving, serving church in my first post: because we need to see fruit. We need to know that the truth of the Gospel is being acted out, that loving service is happening in the body of Christ. The only way healing can come to those wounded and marred by poor doctrine and cruelty, is by the true, real Gospel being administered to the hurt and wounded.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s another important point worth mentioning here. No church is perfect, and it\u2019s important that we differentiate between scandalous, evil behavior and the everyday pitfalls and weaknesses of a body that has yet to be sanctified. A worship service that is less than perfect, a message from the pulpit that rubs you the wrong way, a couple of congregants who gossip after church\u2014these are issues that need to be sanctified, but are not necessarily grounds to run away from the church. Here are some thoughts from an article I wrote on this subject a couple years ago:", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/shutterstock_288328859.jpg", "published_at": "2016-08-26"}
