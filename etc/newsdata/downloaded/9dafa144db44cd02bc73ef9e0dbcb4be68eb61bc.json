With first state primaries rapidly approaching, her many challengers have dwindling opportunities to emerge as powerful alternatives to the progressive agenda she\u2019s championing.\n\nThe night\u2019s confrontations were mostly fought on familiar terrain for the Democrats, who have spent months sparring over the future of health care with former Vice President Joe Biden and other moderates pressing for a measured approach while Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders call for a dramatic, government-funded overhaul of the insurance market. Still, unlike Sanders, Warren refused to say whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for a Medicare for All universal health insurance plan \u2014 a stance that\u2019s increasingly difficult to maintain given her more prominent status.\n\nHer rivals seized on the opportunity to pounce.\n\n\u201cI appreciate Elizabeth\u2019s work but, again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done,\u201d said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar.\n\nPete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, added: \u201cWe heard it tonight. A \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 question that didn\u2019t get a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 answer.\u201d\n\nWarren insisted that she has \u201cmade clear what my principles are here,\u201d arguing that lower premiums would mean that overall costs would go down for most Americans.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris tried to get in on the action on another subject, scolding Warren for not echoing her calls for Twitter to suspend Trump\u2019s account. Warren responded, \u201cI don\u2019t just want to push Trump off of Twitter. I want to push him out of the White House.\u201d\n\nFeaturing a dozen candidates, the debate sponsored by CNN and The New York Times was the largest in modern history. It was the first time the White House hopefuls gathered in a little more than a month. In that time, the political landscape has changed with Trump facing an impeachment inquiry in the House centered on his quest to get Ukraine to dig up unflattering details about Biden, another front-runner among the Democrats hoping to unseat the president.\n\nThe debate also served as Sanders\u2019 return to the campaign trail following a heart attack earlier this month. The Vermont senator failed to show all the fire of previous debates but made his points with force. He was applauded when he thanked supporters and rivals for their good wishes and declared, \u201cI\u2019m feeling great.\u201d\n\nThe debate touched on foreign policy, too, a subject that has dominated the news in recent weeks as Trump said he was withdrawing most U.S. forces from Syria and then Turkey invaded the northern part of the country to attack Kurdish fighters.\n\nHawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who served in Iraq with the Army, questioned the need for U.S. involvement in \u201cregime change\u201d conflicts in the Middle East. That prompted Buttigieg, himself a veteran, to respond: \u201cWhat we are doing or what we were doing in Syria was keeping our word.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have a hard time today looking an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there,\u201d said Buttigieg, who served in Afghanistan. \u201cIt is undermining the honor of our soldiers. You take away the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next.\u201d\n\nBiden has faced the sharpest criticism from rivals in previous debates. But fewer candidates engaged with him on Tuesday as they trained their focus on Warren.\n\nStill, he struggled to fully explain why his newly promised ethics plan to prevent conflicts of interest involving his relatives wasn\u2019t applied to his son Hunter when he was hired in 2014 as a director for a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nThat relationship has become a focal point of Trump\u2019s push for a Ukrainian government probe of the Bidens \u2014 an effort that was a major factor leading to the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nOn Sunday, Biden had vowed that \u201cno one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in on meetings as if they\u2019re a Cabinet member, will in fact have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country.\u201d\n\nCNN anchor Anderson Cooper asked, \u201cIf it\u2019s not OK for a president\u2019s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it OK for your son when you were vice president?\u201d\n\nBiden faltered some before offering, \u201cMy son did nothing wrong, I did nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nToward the end, Biden was more confident when he accused Warren and Sanders of \u201cbeing vague\u201d on the true costs of Medicare for All.\n\n\u201cTell people what it\u2019s going to cost, how you\u2019re going to do it and why you\u2019re going to do it,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders responded by criticizing the former vice president\u2019s record, including his support for what Sanders called the \u201cdisastrous war in Iraq.\u201d Warren also accused Biden of not doing enough as vice president to empower a consumer financial protection agency she helped set up in the wake of the national financial crisis.\n\n\u201cI went on the floor and got you votes,\u201d Biden responded, waving his finger at Warren.\n\nWarren answered that she was \u201cdeeply grateful\u201d that then-President Barack Obama supported her efforts, implying that Biden didn\u2019t help.\n\nShe swatted back at criticism of her sweeping plan to tax wealth Americans to pay for her domestic agenda. Klobuchar said she wanted to provide a \u201creality check\u201d on the issue while former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke suggested it was \u201cpunitive.\u201d\n\nWarren framed the measure as part of the ambitious agenda she\u2019s pitching to fundamentally reshape the economic and political system.\n\n\u201cLook, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,\u201d Warren answered.\n\nThough Warren fielded much of the criticism on Tuesday, other rivalries emerged.\n\nO\u2019Rourke and Buttigieg argued about gun control, with the mayor saying the Texan himself wasn\u2019t even sure how the mandatory federal buyback of assault weapons he\u2019s called for would work. That touched off a stretch where both candidates talked over one another.\n\nAt one point, Buttigieg told O\u2019Rourke: \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.\u201d\n\nAlso debating were New York entrepreneur Andrew Yang, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Obama housing chief Juli\u00e1n Castro and billionaire activist Tom Steyer.\n\n___\n\nWeissert and Superville reported from Washington.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren repeatedly came under attack during Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate as rivals accused the Massachusetts senator of ducking", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/15/6f729b_aptopix-election-2020-debate-69824-elizabeth-warren-joe-biden-pete-buttigieg-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
