That's why I didn't stop.\"\n\n(Image: BPM MEDIA)\n\nThe Fiesta, which was being driven by 34-year-old Paskin without a licence or insurance, failed to stop for police.\n\nA short time later it was found crashed into the Volkswagen.\n\nThree people travelling in the Volkswagen suffered minor injuries in the collision.\n\nMs Handley, from West Bromwich, was taken to hospital after the crash where she later died.\n\nPaskin had evaded police by running red lights at up to 70mph during two high-speed chases within hours of each other on August 17 this year.\n\nAliya Rashid, prosecuting, said Paskin's Fiesta was made the subject of a police marker after failing to stop in the early hours for a police patrol, which abandoned the pursuit in the Ladywood area of Birmingham.\n\nMs Rashid told the court: \"His speeds on that occasion went up to 90mph in 30-40mph roads.\"\n\nPaskin, who was wearing a mask during the first pursuit, was then spotted by police at 9.30pm on the M6 near Walsall, and was tracked to junction 1 of the M5 at West Bromwich.\n\nThe heroin and cocaine user, who has previous convictions for 67 offences including 10 of driving while disqualified, then drove on a pavement to try to escape from police.\n\n(Image: BPM MEDIA)\n\nHe crashed less than a minute after officers again called off efforts to pursue the Fiesta due to safety fears.\n\nPaskin, who had no lights on, was said by witnesses to be driving at around 100mph when he crashed into a Volkswagen Golf carrying a family-of-three.\n\nThe serial criminal then pulled his hood up and ran off, leaving Sarah Handley on his rear seat with a fatal head injury.\n\nAfter CCTV footage of the crash scene was shown in court, a family victim impact statement was read paying tribute to Miss Handley and describing her loved one's pain.\n\nPassing sentence, Judge Melbourne Inman QC said Paskin - who was jailed for dangerous driving in 2007 and 2015 and was four times over the drug-driving limit - had a truly appalling record of previous offending.\n\nThe judge told Paskin: \"Your behaviour in this court during the sentencing hearing, when the victim personal statements of Sarah's parents were being read out, was utterly deplorable.\n\n(Image: BPM MEDIA)\n\n\"I don't punish you for that but it's clearly beyond doubt that you appear to have no remorse. Your only concern appears to be yourself and nobody else, including sadly Sarah and her family.\"\n\nPaskin, who handed himself in at Oldbury police station six hours after the fatal crash, was also sentenced to a driving ban of 12 years and eight months.\n\nHe pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to dangerous driving, causing death by dangerous driving, having no insurance, and driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence.\n\nPaying tribute to Ms Handley after her death, her family said in a statement: \"We are devastated to have lost Sarah who was a loved mother, daughter, sister and aunty.\"", "description": "Adrian Paskin has been jailed at Birmingham Crown Courtafter earlier pleading guilty to causing the death of Sarah Handley by dangerous driving", "authors": ["Talia Shadwell", "Image", "Pa", "Bpm Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20074424.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Sarah-Handley-death.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
