Hulu is also facing more competition from the likes of Disney and Apple that are prepping ad-free streaming services as they all try to keep up with (also ad-free) Netflix.\n\nHulu said 40% of its users binge-watch at least one show a month.

It historically has run fewer ads than traditional TV and has given viewers choices about the kinds of ads they see. Earlier this year it introduced \"pause\" ads, a format that appears when a viewer presses pause while watching a show.\n\nHulu has a few dozen data scientists who tackle various problems in areas from video streaming to marketing to content, Kolhatkar said.\n\nAI has become a sexy term these days. At the same time, Kolhatkar said, it's raised some concerns at the company about the role it will play in creating video content. She said in the best case scenario, AI will augment, not replace, creators.\n\n\"There's a lot of fear about what AI can do,\" she said. \"That's not where this is going.\"", "description": "Hulu has a history of introducing new ad types, and the hope is that these formats will retain viewers who are fleeing linear TV's heavy ad loads.", "authors": ["Lucia Moses"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8a68812e22af1129397433?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
