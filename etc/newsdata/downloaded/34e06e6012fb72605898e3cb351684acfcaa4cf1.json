He and President Donald Trump see eye to eye in their hard-line views on immigration.\n\nBut there\u2019s a problem: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has no use for Mr. Cuccinelli, and that could make him unconfirmable by the Senate. The former attorney general of Virginia used to lead a group focused on challenging incumbent Republican senators from the right, including Senator McConnell.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Wednesday at a Monitor Breakfast, Mr. Cuccinelli made clear that he wants to be judged on his current job performance, not his past political activities.\n\n\u201cI led the Senate Conservatives Fund, not one of his favorite organizations, which may be the understatement of the breakfast so far,\u201d Mr. Cuccinelli said of Senator McConnell. \u201cBut his concerns were political. And I don\u2019t know how he would answer, but I think an objective observer would note that I haven\u2019t engaged in any of that political realm since I\u2019ve taken this role.\u201d\n\nThe current acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Kevin McAleenan, announced his resignation last Friday, the latest departure from an administration known for record-high turnover. The immigration issue, in particular, is a high-stakes, high-stress realm in the Trump era.\n\nMr. Cuccinelli revealed that he met with senators Tuesday and expected to talk to more Wednesday, but not Mr. McConnell.\n\n\u201cIn terms of pursuing the president\u2019s agenda, we\u2019ve been doing a good job at USCIS,\u201d Mr. Cuccinelli said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I would ask those folks to be judging me on.\u201d\n\nUSCIS deals with legal immigration, and has stirred controversy with new rules that would limit access to visas and legal residency permits known as green cards. One rule, issued in August, expanded the definition of \u201cpublic charge\u201d - that is, forms of public assistance that could exclude an applicant from receiving a green card. That rule was due to go into effect Oct. 15, but was blocked temporarily Oct. 11 by federal judges.\n\n\u201cTo a certain extent, we intended to send the message that we expect self-sufficiency among family and employment immigrants,\u201d Mr. Cuccinelli said. \u201cIt doesn't apply in the humanitarian space to refugees and asylees and so forth.\u201d\n\nThe USCIS chief saw a clear political agenda in the injunctions.\n\n\u201cIt is telling to see some of the language of some of the judges,\u201d Mr. Cuccinelli said. \u201cI mean, it reads more like a hotly written op-ed by a political activist than a legal decision by a neutral arbiter.\u201d\n\nThe C-SPAN video of the breakfast can be viewed here.\n\nOther topics at the breakfast included \u201cbirthright citizenship,\u201d the future of young undocumented immigrants protected during the Obama administration, and why the administration is restricting legal immigration at a time when the U.S. economy needs workers. Here are excerpts:\n\nOn changing birthright citizenship, or automatic citizenship for almost anyone born in the U.S., as enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution:\n\n\u201cI do not think you need an amendment to the Constitution. I think the question is, do you need congressional action or can the executive act on their own?\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has focused on the issue periodically, but Mr. Cuccinelli said it hasn\u2019t come up much in his work at USCIS.\n\nOn beneficiaries of the Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the focus of a Supreme Court case to be heard Nov. 12:\n\n\u201cPresuming that that law is found to be as illegal as President Obama said it was over 20 times before he signed it, then it departs the legal world. And those people will be in the position as they are today. They're here illegally under whatever circumstances they may have come. They will join the ranks of millions of people in that circumstance.\n\n\u201cBut I rather expect to see some discussion at the congressional-presidential level over that. I think the president has already sort of publicly signaled that he's willing to do that, as have members of Congress on both sides of the aisle.\u201d\n\nOn what happens to DACA recipients if Congress and White House can\u2019t reach a deal:", "description": "At a Monitor Breakfast, acting USCIS Director Ken Cuccinelli said, 'The question is, do you need congressional action or can the executive act on their own?'", "authors": ["Linda Feldmann"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hJ.mO5OMISqrm2a1oK_ryw--~B/aD02MDA7dz05MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/csmonitor.com/9dc899df61a49385d4b1b1c4275a47f1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
