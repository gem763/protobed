I\u2019ve been blessed to have been doing this this long. That\u2019s what it means.\u201d Bochy said.\n\nFans who stuck around Fenway Park were chanting Bochy\u2019s name at the end and Boston manager Alex Cora saluted from the opposite dugout, knowing the significance of what Bochy has achieved in 25 years of managing.\n\n\u201cThat number just represents so many people, more than anybody are those players. Hopefully when they hear that number, they realize what a big part they had to do with it. It doesn\u2019t happen without them.\u201d\n\nThe Giants broke out champagne in the clubhouse for a postgame celebration, which included a few understated remarks from their beloved skipper.\n\n\u201cIt was actually pretty relaxed and very Boch-esque. Just gave a little speech and said what he always says \u2014 how much he appreciates the guys. And we know that, so that\u2019s why we play so hard for him,\u201d said Jeff Samardija, who took a no-hitter into the sixth on Bochy\u2019s big night. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to let him down. When you have that respect for a manager, the team shows up every night and is always competing.\u201d\n\nBochy won 951 games while managing the San Diego Padres over 12 seasons and is 1,049-1,047 in 13 years with San Francisco, which won three World Series titles with Bochy at the helm.\n\nCora opened his postgame remarks by congratulating Bochy.\n\n\u201cAt this level that\u2019s kind of like unreal. I think everybody that gets to do this job wish they could last that long and be able to do what he has done throughout his career,\u201d Cora, who is wrapping up just his second season as a manager in the majors. \u201cThe way he\u2019s gone about the business. I mean, he\u2019s been amazing, so congratulations.\u201d\n\nThe Giants helped Bochy reach 2,000 with just 10 games remaining in the season. The 10 other managers to win 2,000 are all Hall of Famers and Bochy is sure to follow.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a players\u2019 coach, which I think is the ultimate compliment,\u201d Samardzija said. \u201cHe understands the sacrifices we make. He understands the grind we go through. He hasn\u2019t forgotten that.\u201d\n\nSamardzija didn\u2019t allow a hit until the sixth inning and the Giants gave him plenty of offense, tagging eight Boston pitchers for 15 hits while winning for the second straight night at Fenway Park. San Francisco blew the game open with two runs in the eighth and five more in the ninth and will try and complete a three-game sweep of the interleague series Thursday afternoon.\n\nRafael Devers hit his 30th home run and Jackie Bradley Jr. homered for the second straight night for the Red Sox.\n\nStephen Vogt hit a two-run homer in the first and finished with four RBIs for the Giants. Samardzija (11-12) pitched six innings, holding Boston to one run on two hits and four walks. He struck out two.\n\nWILD NIGHT\n\nThe Giants capitalized quickly on control issues by Boston starter Jhoulys Chac\u00edn, who was tagged for three runs in the first inning and didn\u2019t make it through the third despite striking out six.\n\nChac\u00edn (3-11) was in trouble from the start with a walk to leadoff batter Mike Yastrzremski, followed by a Brandon Belt\u2019s double to left-center. Kevin Pillar drove in Yastzremski on a fielder\u2019s choice and Vogt lined a two-out homer off the Pesky Pole to give the Giants a 3-0 lead.\n\nBrandon Crawford\u2019s RBI double in the third put San Francisco up 4-0, which was plenty of cushion for Samardzija, who didn\u2019t allow a hit until Devers\u2019 homer with two outs in the sixth.\n\nEnderson Franco made his major-league debut when he started the ninth for San Francisco. He allowed Bradley\u2019s homer, which bounced off the top of the Green Monster and was initially ruled a triple before being overturned after a video review.\n\nMORE YAZ\n\nYastrzemski hit an RBI single in the ninth, one night after homering in his first game at Fenway, where his Hall of Fame grandfather, Carl, played 23 seasons with the Red Sox. Carl Yastrzemski, Boston\u2019s beloved \u201cYaz,\u201d threw out the ceremonial first pitch Wednesday night.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nGiants: C Buster Posey (back, hip) could return to the lineup Thursday, Bochy said.\n\nRed Sox: Cora said LHP David Price (cyst left wrist), who hasn\u2019t pitched since Sept. 1, will have surgery on his left wrist and is done for the season. \u201cWe\u2019re going to shut him down,\u201d Cora said. \u201cIt\u2019s a head start to next year and a smart thing to do.\u201d . OF Mookie Betts missed his fourth straight game with inflammation in his left foot. Cora said Betts could return as DH this weekend when the Red Sox visit Tampa Bay. . IF Sam Travis was under the concussion protocol after getting hit in the head by a throw while sliding into third Tuesday night.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLHP Madison Bumgarner (9-8, 3.73 ERA) starts for the Giants in the series finale Thursday afternoon against Red Sox LHP Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez (17-6, 3.64).\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The San Francisco Giants helped manager Bruce Bochy reach yet another milestone before his retirement at the end of the season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Doug Alden"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/giants_red_sox_baseball_02305_c23-0-2540-1468_s1770x1032.jpg?85599e616423230217187bdaa1eaaab66600e3a9", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
