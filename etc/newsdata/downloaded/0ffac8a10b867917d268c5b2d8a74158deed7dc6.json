That's about all these algae need to enable them to consume the pollutants and grow.\n\nThis self-sufficient process can produce as much as 20kg of dry spirulina per day.\n\nThe green powder can then be sold to produce cosmetics, fertilizers, animal feed, or even material for 3D printing. An opportunity for manufacturers wanting to benefit from their wastewater.\n\nFree Oxygen\n\nA full-scale test was carried out at the KOTO factory in Ljubljana, Slovenia which specialises in collecting animal hides.\n\nThe water coming out of its warehouse is three times more saline than the sea, making it very expensive to treat with conventional methods, which require a lot of oxygen.\n\nBut an algae culture has been installed at the factory which produces oxygen for free and in a sustainable way.\n\nThe algae are mixed with bacteria, absorbing the carbon dioxide it produces and turning it into oxygen.\n\nTechnical manager at Saltgae, Robert Reinhardt, says they are saving approximately 50 to 70% of the energy used in wastewater treatment:\n\n\"There is less energy consumption, less carbon dioxide emissions and another important point is that with more uptake of nutrients into the biomass, we have fewer problems with eutrophication, we can recycle nutrients instead of releasing them in the environment producing bad effects in the environment.\"\n\nSo, for now, the work continues to test various species of algae, and install cultures near European factories, and pave the way towards a more circular economy.", "description": "Researchers for the European  'Saltgae' project are demonstrating how algae can cut the costs of treating polluted water- and do it in a sustainable way.", "authors": ["Cyril Fourneris"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/99/70/12/1000x563_cmsv2_c319a803-fbc9-574a-8ef7-18753b71c9fe-3997012.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-26"}
