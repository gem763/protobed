I was able to unite these two tribes to play football, and good football,\u201d he said in a 2013 BBC interview of the mixed Rwandan team of Hutu and Tutsi players.\n\nHis last national job was at Samoa in 2003 but he still yearned to manage teams deep into this eighties.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just your typical cheery soul from the Rhineland,\u201d the European soccer governing body UEFA quoted him as saying in 2015.\n\n\u201cWhen I kick the bucket, I want my life to have been worth it. That\u2019s why I enjoyed taking the biggest risks.\u201d", "description": "Rudi Gutendorf, the tireless soccer manager who guided a world record 55 teams, including 18 national sides, has died at 93, German media reported.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
