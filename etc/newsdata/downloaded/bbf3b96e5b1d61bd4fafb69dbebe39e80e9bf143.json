The cause of death was listed as smoke inhalation; Awan sustained no injuries from the crash.\n\nThe fire allegedly originated from the batteries, which in a Tesla are below the floor.\n\n\u201cFire engulfed the car and burned Dr. Awan beyond recognition \u2014 all because the Model S has inaccessible door handles, no other way to open the doors, and an unreasonably dangerous fire risk,\u201d according to the suit.\n\nThe handles are supposed to extend when it senses the key fob in the driver\u2019s hands, but it doesn\u2019t always go so smoothly.
