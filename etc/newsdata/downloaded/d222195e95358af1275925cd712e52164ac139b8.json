After Trump advertised himself as \u201can extremely good arbitrator,\" a foreign reporter suggested that should Trump successfully broker peace, he would \u201cvery likely and definitely\u201d receive the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nTrump then offered up former President Barack Obama as an example of the prize being unfairly awarded.\n\n\u201cThey gave one to Obama immediately upon his ascent to the presidency and he had no idea why he got it,\u201d Trump said, joking: \u201cYou know what? That was the only thing I agreed with him on.\u201d\n\nObama received the famed award in 2009, less than nine months into his term in the White House for what the Nobel Committee said were \u201cextraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy\u201d and his calls for nuclear nonproliferation. The honor drew confusion at the time from some in the international community who questioned what he could have done so soon in his presidency to merit such an achievement, especially with wars in the Middle East still raging. Even some in the White House expressed surprise at the win.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Prior to that, South Korean President Moon Jae-in reportedly said last April that Trump deserved the Nobel Prize for his work to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, remarks Trump called \u201cvery generous\u201d at the time.\n\nAsked during a Cabinet meeting at the time whether he thought he deserved the honor, Trump told reporters: \u201cEveryone thinks so, but I would never say it.\"\n\nNo such peace has occurred on the peninsula, and Trump\u2019s last meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ended without a deal on denuclearization. Trump has downplayed the North Koreans\u2019 recent short-range missile tests, and has suggested he could meet with Kim again prior to next year\u2019s election.\n\nThe president has also yet to produce his administration's plan to broker peace between Israel and Palestine, which Trump has said would be the \"deal of the century.\" Nor has he been able to entice Iran back to the table to negotiate fixes to the 2015 nuclear deal that he unilaterally withdrew from last year.\n\nAnd earlier this month, he scrapped talks with the Taliban at the last minute after U.S. negotiators said they reached a deal in principle to bring an end to the war in Afghanistan.\n\nWinners for the six Nobel prizes are expected to be announced sometime next month.\n\n\n\nCORRECTION: This article has been updated to show that Trump is trying to broker peace between Israel and Palestine.", "description": "Trump has repeatedly floated the idea that he deserves the peace prize for his efforts to bring peace to the Korean peninsula.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3088/1155968404_6088808475001_6088807363001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
