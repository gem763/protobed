That means the patent held by Charlotte's Web gives it legal protection from a competitor growing that specific cultivar from a clone.\n\nCharlotte's Web may have also been awarded a Utility patent as well, but that isn't available to the public until after a waiting period of 18 months. The basic difference between the two is a Utility patent also covers seeds and the various chemical compositions of the plant. A Utility patent gives a plant a wider range of protections.\n\nAs for the characteristics of the plant itself, it would yield a significant amount of dry weight CBD which would be then extracted and sold to consumers. It also appears to have the ability to be grown in a number of different environments, providing more flexibility on the production side of the equation.\n\nWith a number of U.S. hemp farmers struggling at times to keep their hemp from getting hot, which means from exceeding the legal 0.3% THC threshold, the low amount of THC in CW2A would provide a wide margin of safety.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a hemp patent, not a cannabis patent. There have been a number of cannabis patents that have been applied for and approved of.\n\nThe difference between hemp and cannabis isn't botanical, but legal. Hemp is identified legally as having no more than 0.3% THC in it.\n\nSignificance of the patent\n\nI've been saying for some time the long-term profitability in the cannabis sector is going to eventually come to those companies that are able to develop various strains or research-backed characteristics that differentiate themselves from competitors.\n\nIn the short term recreational pot will continue to be the biggest generator or revenue, but CBD and medical pot are eventually going to be the products that generate the widest margins and strongest earnings.\n\nAs for this hemp patent and Charlotte's Web, this could be a huge competitive advantage for the company. It's interesting that the company didn't tout the patent, which suggests to me it either is waiting for a Utility patent to be revealed, or for those of us that discover it and report on its potential.\n\nWith the well-known Charlotte's Web strain, and the Stanley brothers adding a hemp patent to their arsenal, it could be a tremendous branding and marketing opportunity for the company, which could be more important than the hemp patent and the accompanying positive characteristics.\n\nThe Stanley brothers, the founders and operators of Charlotte's Web Holdings, are excellent at branding and marketing. It's easy to see how they could leverage this to take a commanding lead in the CBD market.\n\nThat's why it's puzzling as to why they didn't go public with their achievement. It's also why I think there's more to come, by which I mean a potential Utility patent to be revealed.\n\nStory continues", "description": "It was recently discovered that Charlotte's Web Holdings (CWBHF) has been awarded what appears to be the first U.S. patent for a hemp strain, according to US Patent and Trademark Office filings.A report from Leafly noted that the related \"documents describe CW2A as a hardy plant, resistant to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NN9ZWTuwi7Lb5WX58El5xw--~B/aD00ODA7dz0xNTA1O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/tipranks_452/1eec3e495b6eb2f2bc07cf9885c15329", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
