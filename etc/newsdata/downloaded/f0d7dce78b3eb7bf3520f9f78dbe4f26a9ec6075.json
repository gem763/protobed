Trump, had clinched the Republican nomination for president, Esquire magazine ran a story entitled \u201cJared Kushner\u2019s Second Act.\u201d It was written by veteran journalist Vicky Ward and exposed a number of less-than-flattering details about the then 35-year-old head of his family\u2019s real estate firm, Kushner Companies.\n\nWard\u2019s profile depicted a young, entitled scion who was at turns arrogant and vindictive. In one sense, the story emasculated Kushner, portraying him as a subservient son-in-law. This was certainly not the image of her husband that Ivanka Trump wanted presented to the world in the glossy pages of a popular men\u2019s magazine.\n\nSo she did what any rich, New York City media-connected, powerful spouse would do\u2014and then took it up a couple of notches: Ivanka, according to Ward, called Esquire\u2019s editor-in-chief at the time, Jay Fielden, and literally started crying, pleading with him to take down the story. Firing on all cylinders, Ivanka also texted Ward and said she did not recognize her husband in the Esquire piece. Fielden, Ward told me, instantly saw through Ivanka\u2019s \u201ccrocodile tears.\u201d Jared and Ivanka\u2019s side leveled against Ward for falsifying the story. But the piece remained online and was published in the October print issue; no substantive changes or retractions were made to Ward\u2019s reporting. (The White House did not respond to a request for comment from Ivanka on the Esquire incident.)\n\nWhile Jared and Ivanka might not go full Harvey Weinstein on reporters\u2014the former movie executive hired ex-Mossad agents to track journalists and intimidate sources\u2014there is no question, Ward says, that Jared and Ivanka have no compunction going to the head of news outlets to interfere with pieces they deem unflattering. \u201cEvery reporter knows they will be on the phone to Rupert Murdoch. Their guiding credo is PR above everything else. Ivanka thinks she is brilliant at public relations,\u201d said Ward, the author of Kushner, Inc., and a senior reporter at CNN.\n\nThat might explain, in part, why Hunter Biden has gone through a media inquisition about his dealings in Ukraine and China, while Ivanka received virtually no additional press scrutiny after The New Yorker detailed her work on a real estate project in Azerbaijan with local partners who had alleged ties to the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a designated terrorist organization. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee subsequently called on the Justice Department and the Treasury Department to investigate the deal for possibly violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\nThen there was Ivanka\u2019s very close brush with a criminal indictment for inflating condo sales to potential buyers at the Trump Soho, a development project she helped oversee. And remember it was Ivanka, among others, who advocated for the hiring of Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn. (A spokesperson for a prominent Washington think tank told me it was \u201cmalpractice\u201d by congressional Democrats that Ivanka hasn\u2019t been subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee.) Somehow, though, none of these poor judgement calls have made it into the dominant media narrative about the first daughter.\n\nWhile some may see this as business as usual\u2014everyone in politics wants glowing coverage and it wasn\u2019t like the Obama administration was a cakewalk for journalists, either\u2014Ivanka, who along with her husband is an unpaid adviser to the President of the United States, is a whole other press animal. To start, she has spent \u201cthe near-entirety of her adult life working the media,\u201d as The Financial Times noted in a 2017 profile. She also is that rarest of trifectas serving in the West Wing: a celebrity, a social media star, and a child of the sitting president. This status gives her unprecedented power to wield in the media arena, and wield it she does.\n\nIvanka doesn\u2019t blast the press as the enemy of the people, like her father does. Rather, she sees the news media as her personal enrichment and image-enhancement tool\u2014which was, for many years, very much the case when she was a socialite living on the Upper East Side, fawned over by the lifestyle and fashion press. One editor who has worked for three leading national publications told me that she thought that Ivanka is the hardest Washington beat to cover. \u201cWith Donald, it\u2019s all out there. By contrast, Ivanka is secretive, cryptic, controlled, and poised,\u201d the editor said speaking on the condition of anonymity.", "description": "Photo Illustration by Kristen Hazzard/The Daily Beast/Photos GettyOn August 16, 2016, just a few weeks after his father-in-law, Donald J.
