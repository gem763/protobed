Both are currently available for pre-order as 7\u201d vinyl singles on Frank\u2019s website along with videos of them being DJ\u2019d in remix form.\n\nDoes DHL feature clues about Frank\u2019s new album?\n\nLast month, Frank revealed that his new music is inspired by a club sound which will make for a departure from his trademark R&B.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been interested in club, and the many different iterations of nightlife for music and songs. And so the things I look at now have a lot to do with those scenes: Detroit, Chicago, techno, house, French electronic,\u2019 Frank told W magazine.\n\nThe singer\u2019s new music is inspired by the club scene (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018The expectation for artists to be vulnerable and truthful is a lot, you know?\u2014when it\u2019s no longer a choice. Like, in order for me to satisfy expectations, there needs to be an outpouring of my heart or my experiences in a very truthful, vulnerable way. I\u2019m more interested in lies than that. Like, give me a full motion-picture fantasy.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrank, 31, is at the centre of controversy after he announced a New York City club night PrEP+, which is named after an HIV prevention drug.\n\nDefending the name, Frank wrote on his Tumblr page: \u2018I decided to name, what was otherwise going to be a night of lights and music inspired by an era of clubbing that I loved PrEP+ because\u2026\n\n\u2018I started to imagine in an era where so many lives were lost and so much promise was lost forever along with them, what would it have been like if something, anything had existed that in all probability would\u2019ve saved thousands and thousands of lives.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
