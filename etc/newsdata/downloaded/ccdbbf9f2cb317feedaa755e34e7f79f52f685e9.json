They seemed meant to tamp down questions about Mr. Giuliani\u2019s status with a client famous for distancing himself from advisers when they encounter legal problems of their own.\n\nMr. Trump, during a Saturday night appearance on Fox News, called Mr. Giuliani \u201ca great gentleman\u201d and said he is still his lawyer. \u201cI know nothing about him being under investigation. I can\u2019t imagine it,\u201d he told the host Jeanine Pirro.\n\nBefore the lunch, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump spoke on the phone, according to two people familiar with the discussions. Also beforehand, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Giuliani on Twitter as a \u201clegendary \u2018crime buster\u2019 and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC.\u201d\n\nMr. Giuliani \u201cmay seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer,\u201d the president\u2019s tweet continued.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Trump-Giuliani-Lunch.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
