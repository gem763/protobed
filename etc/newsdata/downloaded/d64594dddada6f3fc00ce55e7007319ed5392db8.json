But mostly it\u2019s because, in director Hugo Medrano\u2019s production \u2014 performed in Spanish, with English surtitles \u2014 the role is played with range and naturalness by Soraya Padrao. Whether she\u2019s wielding a sword or sinking to the floor beneath the weight of emotion or cannily manipulating an adversary while fluttering a deceptively flirtatious fan, this Rosaura is an appealing figure who seems fully alive in the world of the play.\n\nHer spontaneity contrasts with the rather calcified proceedings around her: Medrano, GALA\u2019s producing artistic director, hasn\u2019t succeeded in integrating an extemporaneous vibe into the play\u2019s scenes, which tell of rebellion, romantic intrigue and dizzying philosophical soul-searching in the realm of Basilio (Timothy Andr\u00e9s Pabon). Alarmed by a prophecy that his son will be a tyrant and usurper, Basilio has kept Segismundo (Daniel Alonso de Santos) locked away in a cell since infancy. When the king belatedly attempts to test the prediction by releasing the adult prince, all hell breaks loose \u2014 but is nature or nurture at fault? And when Segismundo is told that his previous experience was a dream, might this assertion contain truth?\n\nCalder\u00f3n\u2019s play careens through the world of ideas \u2014 pondering such matters as fate, free will, ethical choice, gender roles and the nature of duty \u2014 but in the GALA production, the physical storytelling is more cramped. The blocking is formal, with the actors often in stand-and-speechify mode. Adding to the aura of artifice are some stage-y performances \u2014 particularly Pabon\u2019s Basilio; Mel Rocher\u2019s version of Clotaldo, Segismundo\u2019s jailer; and Delbis Cardona\u2019s \u00adhyper-broad-stroked clowning as the servant Clar\u00edn.\n\nWhile Alonso de Santos is none too convincing when Segismundo turns wrathful or virtuous, the actor does ace moments of pathos, when the prince huddles twitchily in his jail cell, fidgeting with his chains. Peter Pereyra infuses some warmth and authenticity into Astolfo, a contender for the Polish throne. But Padrao is still the cast standout as Rosaura, who\u2019s in pursuit of a man who has wronged her. A scene of steely, yearning-flecked dalliance between Astolfo and Rosaura is the highlight of the play.\n\nThe production benefits hugely from Jes\u00fas D\u00edaz Cort\u00e9s\u2019s gorgeous, often gold-steeped lighting, which heightens the narrative\u2019s fable-like aspects and underscores the motif of dreams. Moyenda Kulemeka and Eric J. Davis designed the pretty ye-olde-Slavonic costumes.\n\nMilagros Ponce de Le\u00f3n\u2019s spare set, with its stark staircases, suits the play\u2019s awareness of vertiginous existential depths. Is Segismundo dreaming? Are we all? Can we ever know anything for certain? Rosaura is at least sure about one thing. When Clotaldo asks her whom she can depend upon, she answers, \u201cMyself.\u201d\n\nLife Is a Dream (La Vida Es Sue\u00f1o), by Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca, adapted by Nando L\u00f3pez.
