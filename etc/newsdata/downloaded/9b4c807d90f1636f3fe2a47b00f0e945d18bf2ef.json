Beijing did not specify the value of the goods that face higher tariffs from Sunday.\n\nThe extra tariffs of 5% and 10% were levied on 1,717 items of a total of 5,078 products originating from the United States. Beijing will start collecting additional tariffs on the rest from 15 December.\n\nThe new round of tariffs promises more volatility when stock markets resume trading on Monday, although Wall Street is closed for the Labor day holiday.\n\nIndependent Australian market strategist, Greg McKenna, said that market concerns had been repeatedly soothed by conciliatory words from Beijing and Washington.\n\nBut he said reality could begin to bite with Sunday\u2019s new round of tariffs.\n\n\u201cAll the while the tariffs are actually being imposed and the global growth, earnings, and interest rate cycles are pointing down again,\u201d he said. \u201cOn top of that, the inverted US yield curve suggests to many that at best the US economy is slowing materially and at worst that the recession count down has begun.\u201d\n\nThe trade tariffs on China have contributed a slowing of the Chinese economy, as well as other countries\u2019 economies in the region.\n\nA snapshot of the country\u2019s giant manufacturing sector released on Saturday showed that activity contracted for the fourth month in succession in August.\n\nThe Chinese yuan has also come under pressure and fell to an 11-year low against the US dollar last week. South Korea said on Sunday that its exports had fallen for the ninth month in a row.\n\nBut Chinese state media struck a defiant note on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe United States should learn how to behave like a responsible global power and stop acting as a \u2018school bully\u2019,\u201d the official Xinhua news agency said.\n\n\u201cAs the world\u2019s only superpower, it needs to shoulder its due responsibility, and join other countries in making this world a better and more prosperous place. Only then can America become great again.\u201d\n\nTariffs could not impede China\u2019s development, said the official People\u2019s Daily of the ruling Communist Party.\n\nWhite House insists Trump not having second thoughts on China trade war Read more\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s booming economy has made China a fertile ground for investment that foreign companies cannot ignore,\u201d it said, in a commentary under the name Zhong Sheng, or \u201cVoice of China\u201d, which is often used to state its view on foreign policy issues.\n\nLast month, Donald Trump said he was imposing tariffs on $300bn worth of Chinese imports previously spared in the trade dispute.\n\nSome of the tariffs were later delayed until December in a concession to US retailers. Tariffs of 15% on cellphones, laptop computers, toys and clothing are to take effect on December 15.\n\nThe president has also announced that existing 25% tariffs on a separate group of $250 billion of Chinese imports will increase to 30% on 1 October.\n\nOnce all the measures have taken effect by December, nearly all of China\u2019s $540bn worth of exports to the US will be subject to the levies.\n\nThe US trade representative\u2019s office said on Thursday it would collect public comments until 20 September on a planned tariff increase to 30% on a $250bn list of goods already hit with a 25% tariff.\n\nTrade teams from China and the United States continue to talk and will meet this month, but tariff hikes on Chinese goods set to go in place on Sunday will not be delayed, Trump has said.\n\nFor two years, the Trump administration has sought to pressure China to make sweeping changes to its policies on intellectual property protection, forced transfers of technology to Chinese firms, industrial subsidies and market access.\n\nChina has consistently denied Washington\u2019s accusations that it engages in unfair trade practices, vowing to fight back in kind and criticising US measures as protectionist.\n\nReuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Chinese exports worth $125bn will face new taxes from 1 September, while China places levy on oil as agreement becomes more distant", "authors": ["Martin Farrer"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f67a65928ca89589cd154e1a161dcb4b3c8e587/0_123_3605_2162/master/3605.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2eaa176b26665bf499d3169de635ec91"}
