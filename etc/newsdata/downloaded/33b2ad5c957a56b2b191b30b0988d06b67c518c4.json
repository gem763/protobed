REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\n\nBob Foresman faced a civil fraud lawsuit filed by Yukos\u2019 former managers that alleged the American banker, then vice president of Moscow investment bank Renaissance Capital, conspired with Russian state officials to pre-agree the sale of Yukos Finance BV to a consortium of foreign investors at a fixed price range.\n\nA judge this week dismissed the lawsuit saying there was \u201cno smoking gun\u201d that showed Foresman, acting with four other foreign executives named in the lawsuit, entered into any \u201cunlawful agreement\u201d with Russian state oil company, Rosneft, to pre-arrange the auction in the consortium\u2019s favour.\n\nLawyers for the former Yukos management had based their case on a cache of emails from Renaissance Capital. Foresman had written a memo to three other senior executives at Renaissance Capital pointing to the Kremlin-run Yukos asset auctions as \u201cthe trade of our lives.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit followed the Russian government\u2019s levying of \u201cenormous retrospective tax assessments requiring immediate payment\u201d which led to Yukos\u2019 break-up and sale in a series of state-run auctions, Judge Michael Burton said.\n\nRussian state oil champion Rosneft acquired most of Yukos\u2019 assets. But senior executives at Renaissance Capital formed a consortium of foreign investors to acquire Yukos Finance BV, which held Yukos\u2019 Dutch assets, through a bidding vehicle previously owned by Rosneft, at an August 15, 2007 auction.\n\nThe sale was soon overturned by a Dutch court which ruled the transaction invalid. The Dutch unit held up to $1.5bn in cash reserves, of which $650m was net of debt, while it also held a 49 per cent stake in a strategically important Slovakian pipeline operator, Transpetrol.\n\nThe foreign consortium had signed an internal investment agreement between themselves that said the group would not be willing to bid more than $310m for the asset, should there be more than one participant in the auction, the court ruling said.\n\nThe judge found that the agreement setting an \u201cexpress limit on the consortium\u2019s bid\u201d to be \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the suggestion that the price had been rigged.\n\n\u201cThis very powerful judgement is a complete vindication for Mr Foresman who has been living with these very serious charges hanging over him for many years,\u201d Mark Dawkins, the lead lawyer for Foresman said in a statement.\n\nForesman was not able to respond immediately to a request for comment.", "description": "A London judge has cleared a vice-chairman at UBS investment bank of claims he knowingly took part in a rigged auction in 2007 during the Russian state's breakup of Mikhail Khodorkovsky's Yukos oil major.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439778907&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1RO", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
