[My sister Mandi] will be there to pick me up and tell me to ignore it.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll be in bed really upset and she\u2019ll sit on my bed with me and talk to me about it. No normal person does that, sits and insults someone like that.\u2019\n\nThe former pharmacist \u2013 who has no intention of returning to her former career \u2013 previously said she felt like she got targeted more than the other Islanders.\n\n\u2018The thing I love about black communities is that they stick together, but Middle Easterns \u2026 they don\u2019t have that support,\u2019 she claimed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018When I\u2019m getting DMs like \u201cyou Arab ****\u201d, \u201cyou terrorist\u201d, stuff like that is a sensitive topic and people were getting at me about that.\u2019\n\nAnna was targeted more than the other Islanders while on the show (Picture: ITV)\n\nThe sisters are very close (Picture: Simmi London)\n\nWe all recently found out that the Love Island group chat is \u2018dead\u2019 and got collectively upset about it.\n\nBut then, Curtis chimed in to say the group chat apparently wasn\u2019t dead, people were just \u2018busy\u2019.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t say everyone hates each other,\u2019 she said. \u2018Just that there are people who don\u2019t get along. I don\u2019t know what Curtis is talking about. It\u2019s dead.\u2019\n\nAlthough the group chat is no longer a thing, Anna and her sister are too busy securing the bag to care.\n\nThe two are releasing an edit with Essex-based footwear brand Simmi, and are showcasing their favourite styles.\n\nLooks like Anna is bringing her sister Mandi along for the ride.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
