(NOAA/GOES-East)\n\nThe large storm - more typical of November - is unleashing drenching rain, thunderstorms, snow and cold air, and it will produce a high wind zone spanning 900 miles over the north-central United States.\n\nStiff east-to-southeasterly breezes were already present over the central and western Great Lakes region on Monday.\n\nHowever, the strongest winds, blowing from the north and west, will charge across the Plains into Tuesday.\n\n\"Frequent gusts between 40 and 50 mph are in store with an AccuWeather Local StormMax\u2122 of 60 mph,\" Eric Leister, AccuWeather senior meteorologist, said.\n\n\"Gusts that strong can break tree limbs, cause localized power outages and inhibit travel,\" Leister said.\n\nAirline passengers should expect flight delays and cancellations, especially from Nebraska and the Dakotas to Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. As the gusty winds affect the major airports of Chicago, Detroit and Minneapolis, ripple-effect delays can occur elsewhere across the nation.\n\nWinds over this same zone can also be very troublesome for high-profile vehicles such as trucks, campers and buses. With no mountain ranges and only limited forests in the region, there is little to stop the winds blowing across the highways.\n\nWhere winds blow across the Great Lakes, shoreline areas that face the wind can be subject to overwash and flooding.\n\nThe storm producing the strong winds will also cause a batch of rain and embedded thunderstorms to spiral eastward into the Carolinas, mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Tuesday.\n\nAlthough some snow fell in South Dakota and western Nebraska from Sunday into Monday, amounts were minuscule when compared to a storm from earlier this month.\n\nThis storm produced up to 4 inches of snow in the Black Hills of South Dakota with 2-3 inches falling on Rapid City, South Dakota, during Sunday evening.\n\nDownload the free AccuWeather app to see the latest forecast and advisories for your region.
