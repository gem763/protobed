REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha/File Photo\n\nLast year\u2019s growth for Southeast Asia\u2019s second-biggest economy was 4.1%.\n\nThe growth projections came in a report released in Washington on Monday about an Article IV consultation in Thailand by the IMF\u2019s executive board.\n\nAccording to the report, there are different views among directors on whether Thailand has scope for further policy easing.\n\nThe IMF said it welcomed the August rate cut by the Bank of Thailand - its first since April 2015 - and added that \u201cgoing forward, a number of directors saw scope for further monetary easing to help steer inflation back to target\u201d.\n\nIt also said \u201cmany\u201d other directors considered the current monetary stance to be sufficiently accommodative, and noted that monetary policy should be calibrated based on assessment of financial stability risks.\n\nFor September, Thailand reported an annual inflation rate of 0.32%. The central bank\u2019s target range is 1-4%, and it has projected an 0.8% rate for 2019.\n\nRisks to the growth outlook are tilted to the downside stemming from the impact of the global economic slowdown, current trade tensions and weak domestic demand, the IMF said.\n\n\u201cDirectors encouraged an expansionary policy mix to support domestic demand, and structural reforms to promote inclusive and sustainable growth,\u201d the fund said.\n\nOn Sept. 25, the BOT left its benchmark interest rate THCBIR=ECI unchanged at 1.50% after August\u2019s surprise easing. The rate is 25 basis points above the record low.\n\nBOT Governor Veerathai Santiprabhob told Reuters on Friday that the bank was ready to review monetary policy if the global economic condition deteriorated much further.\n\nHe said the central bank planned to further relax rules on capital outflows by the end of the year to help balance flows, as the baht THB=TH climbed.\n\nThe baht is Asia\u2019s best performing currency this year, appreciating nearly 7% against the dollar, driven by the country\u2019 hefty current account surplus and foreign inflows.\n\nThe IMF said many directors considered that Thailand\u2019s external position remained substantially stronger than warranted by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies.\n\n\u201cDirectors emphasized the importance of exchange rate flexibility, with foreign exchange intervention limited to avoiding disorderly market conditions,\u201d it said.\n\nFor the full IMF report, click on bit.ly/2IwqNB8", "description": "Thailand's economic growth rate could slow to 2.9% this year and be 3.0% in 2020, reflecting external and domestic headwinds, the International Monetary Fund said.", "authors": ["Orathai Sriring", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438348025&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970DE", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
