The House Financial Services Committee announced on Wednesday that Facebook's founder and CEO will be making a second appearance before Congress\u2014his second trip to the nation's capital in two months\u2014this time to defend his company's plans for its own global cryptocurrency known as Libra.\n\nThe hearing is set for October 23 and will examine Facebook's potential influence on financial services and housing. But with congressional cameos from major tech CEOs as rare as they are\u2014they generally send product leads or lawyers to represent them in questioning\u2014Zuck\u2019s grilling is likely to cover a range of issues, from Facebook's bad habit of buying up competitors to its supposed anti-conservative bias, a favorite pet topic of House Republicans.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson told The Daily Beast that \u201cMark looks forward to testifying before the House Financial Services Committee and responding to lawmakers\u2019 questions.\u201d\n\nThe hearing is likely to be another high-profile spectacle in which a tech titan does their best to appear nominally cooperative, while divulging new no information and fending off the often meme-worthy moments from tech\u2019s legitimate critics and impossibly tech-inept members of Congress alike.\n\nHouse Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) has made her position on Facebook's proposed digital currency master plan clear from day one. This summer, Waters called for a \u201cmoratorium\u201d on Facebook's plans\u2014a strong position to stake out, even as Facebook continues to absorb threats from regulators across federal agencies and states. She also cited the company's \u201ctroubled past\u201d on consumer privacy, denouncing Facebook's \u201cunchecked expansion\u201d into users' lives.\n\nFacebook's Libra project has suffered a few high-profile setbacks in recent days. News broke this week that PayPal would withdraw from the project, a move that's likely to inspire more fallout from institutional financial partners. And the Libra Association\u2019s Head of Product Sam Morris, a lead in the Facebook-affiliated governing body set to oversee the cryptocurrency, reportedly left the project in August.\n\nZuckerberg's willingness to head back into such hostile territory suggests that the company is starting to take the ominous tone emanating from Congress seriously. It's also a sign that Facebook's cryptocurrency plans, set to launch in 2020, are a life-or-death matter for the company as it charts a path forward\u2014and out of an unrelenting cascade of scandals that's unlikely to quiet down as the 2020 election draws near.", "description": "With Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency under fire, Mark Zuckerberg agrees to head back to Washington for another cameo at the Capitol.", "authors": ["Taylor Hatmaker", "Senior Technology Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3375,w_6000,x_0,y_412/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570647051/191009-hatmaker-zuckerberg_lw4za8", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
