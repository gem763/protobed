Paxton believes this has to do with how the way Google operates in that market.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re literally operating as a buyer, seller, and exchange in all of these transactions related to advertising, which makes it difficult for any competition to be a part of,\u201d said Paxton.\n\nThe attorneys general antitrust probe announcement comes just days after the tech giant confirmed the Justice Department has requested records related to its prior antitrust investigations. Paxton said their probe is independent from the federal agency, and they mean business.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t many other investigations that involves especially this scope and magnitude that involves 50 different attorney general,\u201d he said.\n\nYahoo Finance's All Markets Summit, Oct. 10 More\n\n\n\n\n\nGrete Suarez is producer at Yahoo Finance for YFi PM and The Ticker.
