Under House rules, Speaker Nancy Pelosi would have power to appoint not only the chair of a select committee but its members, as well.\n\nBut the move also comes with some risks. Among them, it is unclear who might be the chair of a special committee\u2014but it would not necessarily be Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY), whose committee has historically wielded Congress\u2019 authority to impeach. Nadler would likely fight any effort to limit his jurisdiction, of which a select committee would be one.\n\nSelect committees on impeachment have been used differently through history; they may investigate impeachment and then also draft articles, or they may only do one of those things. Establishing a select committee is not a necessary part of the impeachment process, however.", "description": "", "authors": ["Stein", "Thedailybeast.Com Trump-Impeachment-House-Dems-Are-Discussing-A-Select-Panel-To-Handle-The-Task"], "top_image": ""}
