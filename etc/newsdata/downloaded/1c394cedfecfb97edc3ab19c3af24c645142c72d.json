Detroit police chief calls out Rep. Rashida Tlaib for \u2018racism\u2019 double standard", "language": "en", "text": "Back in September, Rep. Rashida Tlaib made her problems with the city of Detroit\u2019s use of facial recognition technology fully known:\n\n.@detroitpolice You should probably rethink this whole facial recognition bulls**t.https://t.co/ZvHEEQxzWB \u2014 Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) August 20, 2019\n\nAnd the Detroit PD responded with an invitation:\n\n@RashidaTlaib Before you criticize the software, come to our Real Time Crime Center to see how we @detroitpolice responsibly use it in efforts to identify criminals involved in violent crimes. Let\u2019s set a date. https://t.co/aR7DOjQe2a \u2014 Detroit Police Dept. (@detroitpolice) August 20, 2019\n\nRep. Tlaib was invited to check out the technology she had questions about, and after doing so, she came to a conclusion:\n\nU.S. Rep Rashida Tlaib told Detroit Police Chief James Craig he should only employ black people as analysts on his facial recognition team because \u201cnon-African Americans think African Americans all look the same.\u201dhttps://t.co/qrG27El3AZ \u2014 The Detroit News (@detroitnews) October 2, 2019\n\nYep, that\u2019s what she told the Detroit PD chief and others. From the Detroit News:\n\nThe tour, which lasted more than an hour, was often tense, with Tlaib and Craig wrangling over how the department uses the software, privacy issues, and concerns that the technology misidentifies a disproportionate number of darker-skinned people. A major point of contention: whether only black civilians should work in the crime center analyzing photos flagged by the software. \u201cAnalysts need to be African Americans, not people that are not,\u201d Tlaib told Craig. \u201cI think non-African Americans think African Americans all look the same. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it even on the House floor: People calling Elijah Cummings \u2018John Lewis,\u2019 and John Lewis \u2018Elijah Cummings,\u2019 and they\u2019re totally different people,\u201d Tlaib said, referring to the two longtime Democratic congressmen. \u201cI see it all the time, and I love them because they go along with it.\u201d Craig replied: \u201cI trust people who are trained, regardless of race; regardless of gender. It\u2019s about the training.\u201d\n\nDPD Chief James Craig let Rep. Tlaib know what would happen if he did what she wanted:\n\nRep. @RashidaTlaib said facial recognition techs need to be African-American because \"non-African Americans\" think all black people look alike. Detroit Police Chief James Craig said if he had said that, people would be demanding he resign.https://t.co/JxaJqiwDzO pic.twitter.com/JKXuydfLVd \u2014 Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) October 3, 2019\n\nApparently racism in hiring practices are OK with Rep. Tlaib, as long as the desired end is liberal-approved:\n\nDemocrat Rep. Rashida Tlaib goes full-racist, demands Detroit Police only hire blacks to operate facial recognition software because \"non-African Americans\" think all blacks look alike DP Chief James Craig says that if he said that he would have to resignpic.twitter.com/X9Nux2ZOIG \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 3, 2019\n\nHere are his remarkspic.twitter.com/b0xqCnDmyG \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 3, 2019\n\nDetroit Police Chief James Craig asked if her making that statement with no backlash was a \"double standard.\" Tlaib insisted her comments were fine, saying that facial recognition technology is \"broken,\" despite being shown how it's used.https://t.co/JxaJqiwDzO pic.twitter.com/oshlHwPl0K \u2014 Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) October 3, 2019\n\nWow.\n\nI love the guy standing next to her. He isn't having it. \u2014 Ian Miles Cheong (@stillgray) October 3, 2019\n\nNope, not at all.\n\nwhen you have to say \"I am just saying\" you know that what your spouting is so ridiculous that everyone around you is uncomfortable! This is the democrats always talking about RACE \u2014 Becca (@becca_bk) October 3, 2019\n\nDoubling and tripling down on her ignorance. Good for the police chief calling her out for those statements. https://t.co/Yi2TZXSwRn \u2014 Jessica Fletcher (@heckyessica) October 3, 2019\n\nMy cringe is stuck. Abort Rashida. Abort! \u2014 Jaclyn Taylor (@JackIsAGirl) October 3, 2019\n\nThis was wrong of Tlaib. And I will give respect to police chief Craig for his measured and reasonable reaction to this. https://t.co/AlEnnBlq0Q \u2014 Mitch (@mitdont) October 3, 2019\n\nSo basically Talib is insinuating that only blacks commit crimes in Detroit so they only need black employees identifying them. Sounds a wee bit racist to me. https://t.co/VDV70leMqD \u2014 Nurse Patriot (@LABeachGal1) October 3, 2019\n\nIsn\u2019t it ironic?\n\nholy hell, this is a racist ass statement by @RashidaTlaib . https://t.co/yiYFdpEIGV \u2014 B. Kollinger (@bronk34) October 3, 2019\n\nUnbelievable. BRAVO, Detroit Police Chief, James Craig, with attempts to provide credible education on application and analyst\u2019s training on facial recognition software with US Rep Tliab. https://t.co/E3ZkqWEwqy \u2014 MeLeah (@Smoky158764) October 2, 2019\n\nShe kept looking at the black cop to extort confirmation of her very real racism. \u2014 @heuristic_light (@heuristic_light) October 3, 2019\n\nTlaib (and the rest of the \u201cSquad\u201d for that matter) won\u2019t see the irony.\n\n***\n\nRelated:\n\nWhen can we expect an apology from Rashida Tlaib for her tweet about girl who lied about being assaulted at Karen Pence\u2019s school?", "description": "\"I trust people who are trained, regardless of race.\"", "authors": ["Doug P.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/rashida-tlaib-ap-close-up.jpg"}
