The details of the discussion along with the price offered for the jewelry brand have not been disclosed.\n\nTiffany has a market capitalization of nearly $12 billion after its shares rose 22 percent this year, making the potential acquisition LVMH\u2019s biggest ever and one of the largest deals by a European firm in 2019.\n\nRead more\n\nWhile Tiffany has hired advisers to review the offer, it has not yet responded and there is no guarantee that the sides will reach an agreement, reports said. The fact that the French company\u2019s interest has been made public could shatter the deal, according to the Financial Times, citing a person familiar with the matter.\n\nParis-headquartered LVMH owns multiple luxury brands including Fendi, Hublot watches, Sephora and Givenchy, as well as Hennessy cognac and Dom Perignon champagne. In 2017, fashion house Christian Dior became the latest addition to the luxury empire.\n\nWhen it comes to high-end jewelry, the company has space to expand.
