To test their hypothesis, scientists went looking for the fluid source\u2019s geochemical signature in ancient subducted oceanic crust located on the Greek island of Sifnos.\n\nOxidizing fluids influence the iron isotope composition found large garnet crystals, and because garnet crystals feature rings of growth like a tree, researchers can plot geochemical changes across hundreds of thousands of years of crystal growth.\n\n\u201cGarnet chemical and iron isotope zonation supports the idea that these rocks released oxidizing fluids during subduction,\u201d Ethan Baxter, professor of earth and environmental sciences, said in a news release. \u201cWe have chemically \u2018fingerprinted\u2019 a source of these oxidizing fluids in subduction zones.\u201d\n\nThe measurements suggest an influx of oxidizing fluid from subducted oceanic crust fueled the oxidation of rocks produced by an arc of volcanoes some 45 million years ago.\n\nScientists hope that in followup studies they can figure out what caused the fluids to be oxidizing.\n\n\u201cThese oxidizing fluids carry certain agents capable of oxidizing rocks they enter,\u201d Baxter said. \u201cThe most familiar example would be the way that oxidizing fluids can cause iron-bearing materials to rust as they weather. Based on the garnet chemical zonation, we know the fluids liberated from our samples are oxidizing, but we don\u2019t know why they are oxidizing or what the oxidizing agents are.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 28 (UPI) \u2014 Geologists have linked ancient volcanic activity with a unique geochemical signature measured in rock samples recovered from the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
