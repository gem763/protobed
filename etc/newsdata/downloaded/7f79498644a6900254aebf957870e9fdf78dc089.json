The project works in partnership with London's Horniman Museum and Gardens to create coral spawn, or large egg deposits, in a lab.\n\nScientists checking on the coral in the greenhouse.\n\n\"It's pure excitement to be the first to achieve a breakthrough in the world,\" CEO of the Florida Aquarium Roger Germann told CNN. \"Our team of experts cracked the code...that gives hope to coral in the Florida Reef Tract and to coral in the Caribbean and Atlantic Oceans.\"\n\nGenerating a spawn has never been done for corals native to the Atlantic, so the system was set up to see if it could work. According to Germann, many coral experts even doubted that the aquarium's efforts would produce successful results.\n\nRead More", "description": "The Florida Aquarium in Tampa, Florida, says they've made scientific history as a group of coral has successfully reproduced two days in a row for the first time in a lab setting.", "authors": ["Lauren M.
