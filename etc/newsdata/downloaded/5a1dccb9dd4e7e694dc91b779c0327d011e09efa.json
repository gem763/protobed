The Dealmaster returns today with new deals to share. Topping our list today are two of our current favorite dash cams: you can get the Anker Roav Duo dash cam for $109.99 and the Garmin Dash Cam Mini for $99.99.\n\nAnker's Roav Duo tops our dash cam list because it's an excellent dual-camera unit with most of the features most users would ever need. Using Sony sensors and F1.8 lenses, the Roav Duo records crisp 1080p video both inside and outside your car. While some may not be keen on a dash cam recording their driving habits, it could help back up your story in the case of an accident.\n\nThe front camera's 155-degree field of view should capture all things important happening around your car when you're on the road. The dash cam also has a built-in GPS to tag footage with your location and speed, and the device can run 24/7 if you connect it to an optional parking kit. Like when you're on the road, the Roav Duo will detect impacts when your car is parked and record footage of the incident even when you're not around and while the car is off.\n\nThe biggest downside to the Roav Duo is that it doesn't have a companion mobile app, but that's a small drawback on what's otherwise a great dash cam now at an even better price of $109.99. By contrast, Garmin's minuscule Dash Cam Mini does have a mobile app that you can connect to while near the dash cam to view and download footage. This key-sized dash cam disappears behind your rear-view mirror and records 1080p video of the road ahead with its 140-degree field of view. It's the dash cam to get if you want a device that's barely noticeable on your windshield.\n\nIf dash cams aren't your thing, we also have deals on Chromebooks, headphones, portable chargers, and much more.
