Research by the Andy Warhol Foundation last year finally identified all but one of the 14. They included prominent figures such as Marsha \u201cPay It No Mind\u201d Johnson, who played a key role in the Stonewall uprising of 1969 and co-founded the community group Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR).\n\nTate curators said the paintings were created at time of growing public interest in gender fluidity. \u201cIt is a really amazing portrait of a community in New York at a particular time where trans people would and still do face a lot of injustice and harassment,\u201d said Moran.\n\nFrances Morris, director of Tate Modern, said Warhol was an \u201cartist who feels more relevant and influential today than ever. In today\u2019s climate, it feels important to take a more human and more personal look at somebody who was a very familiar artist.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Self Portrait, 1986.

He grew up in Pittsburgh to Carpatho-Rusyn parents who had emigrated from a small village in what is now Slovakia.\n\nMuir said the journey of Warhol\u2019s father to Hamburg then Ellis Island and then Pittsburgh was an extraordinary one. \u201cThe Warhol story is connected to a range of ideas which are perhaps under question, more than ever.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition will feature over 100 works including key ones from the pop period including Marilyn Diptych, 1962; Elvis I and II, 1963-64; and Race Riot, 1964.\n\nThe exhibition will also include some of Warhol\u2019s wigs \u2013 almost works of art in their own right, said Muir.\n\nSixty Last Suppers, one of his final works before his death in 1987, is one of several in the show that illustrate how themes of faith and mortality recur in his work. It will be displayed in a chapel-like atmosphere.\n\n\u2022 Andy Warhol at Tate Modern, 12 March to 6 September.", "description": "Exhibition will feature one of artist\u2019s biggest \u2018but probably least known\u2019 series of works", "authors": ["Mark Brown"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d94054238a86b801cb6d69bc602cbbe7937e8d76/0_1070_2722_1633/master/2722.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7e71f9d3032552ba6d2841e23c53ae0a", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
