Is that the best way to beat Biden?", "language": "en", "text": "Welcome to 2020 Vision, the Yahoo News column covering the presidential race with one smart, fast takeaway every weekday and a deeper roundup every weekend. Reminder: There are 143 days until the Iowa caucuses and 417 days until the 2020 election.\n\nThe most revelatory moment of Thursday\u2019s debate was a small one. About a half-hour in, during a dizzying discussion of the various candidates\u2019 various health care plans, Juli\u00e0n Castro cut in and said the quiet part out loud.\n\nHe said, in effect, that Joe Biden is old \u2014 too old, perhaps, to beat Donald Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the former vice president is a septuagenarian. If elected in 2020, Biden would become, at 78, the oldest president in U.S. history \u2014 eight years (or two full terms older) than the former record holder, Trump, when he took office.\n\nBut while some of Biden\u2019s rivals have tiptoed around the age question before \u2014 Pete Buttigieg, for instance, talks constantly about \u201cgenerational\u201d change \u2014 none of them has made it explicit.\n\nOnstage in Houston, Castro, 44, finally did.\n\n\u201cThe difference between [the health care plan] I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require [Americans] to opt in, and I would not require them to opt in,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThey would automatically be enrolled. They wouldn't have a buy-in.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do not have to buy in,\u201d Biden interrupted. \u201cThey do not have to buy in.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just said that,\u201d Castro snapped. \u201cYou just said that two minutes ago. You just said two minutes ago that they would have to buy in.\u201d\n\nBiden continued to defend his health care proposal, arguing that if Castro\u2019s grandmother \u201cqualifies for Medicaid, she would automatically be enrolled\u201d in Biden\u2019s version of a \u201cpublic option.\u201d\n\nJuli\u00e0n Castro interviewed after the debate in Houston. (Photo: Jonathan Bachman/Reuters) More\n\nSuddenly, a light bulb seemed to go off for Castro. Whether or not his next line was preplanned \u2014 a strategy to deploy if and when the opportunity presented itself \u2014 is impossible to say. But his message was unmistakable.\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro shouted. \u201cAre you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I mean, I can't believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you're saying they don't have to buy in. You're forgetting that.\u201d\n\nIn other words: The senior citizen might be losing his memory. (For the record, Castro denied this after the debate. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he told reporters when asked if he was implying anything about Biden\u2019s age or mental acuity. \u201cI was going after the difference that we have in health care policy and what he just said on the stage.\u201d)\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, other candidates distanced themselves as well, mainly by calling for unity. \u201cA house divided cannot stand,\u201d said Amy Klobuchar, kind of quoting Abraham Lincoln (who was himself quoting Jesus). Reporters went on to note that Castro\u2019s facts were actually a little fuzzy and that maybe it was he who was \u201cforgetting\u201d: Minutes earlier Biden had said that while most people who lose their jobs would have to \u201cbuy into\u201d his public option, \u201canyone who can't afford it gets automatically enrolled.\u201d As a result, the postshow pundits declared Castro\u2019s assault opportunistic and unfair \u2014 a self-inflicted wound.\n\nThey\u2019re probably right. It\u2019s unlikely Castro will climb in the polls from his current perch at 1 percent just because he called Biden old, and it\u2019s unlikely Biden will plummet from his league-leading position at 27 percent.\n\nBut Castro\u2019s gambit was still telling. Biden\u2019s biggest advantage is his perceived \u201celectability\u201d: the fact that Democratic voters think (by a three-to-one margin) he\u2019s the candidate most likely to beat Trump at the same time they overwhelmingly agree that beating Trump is their No. 1 priority.", "description": "At the Democratic debate in Houston, Juli\u00e0n Castro suggested, in effect, that Joe Biden is old \u2014 too old, perhaps, to beat Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Andrew Romano", "West Coast Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/n4or8Gdh8oQZtrm5Bv7lRw--~B/aD0yMjkzO3c9MzUxMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/9a5e2100-d63d-11e9-bffe-9d466561ee2d", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
