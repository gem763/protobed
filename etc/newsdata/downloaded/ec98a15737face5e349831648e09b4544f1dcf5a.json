Now she\u2019s on life support.", "language": "en", "text": "She had decided that day to put down the vaping device, but it was already too late.\n\nAfter vaping for two years as an alternative to smoking cigarettes, 17-year-old Whitney Livingston came down with a fever that landed her on life support, her mother told Fox4News.com.\n\n\u201cShe could have almost died,\u201d Jennifer Audas told Fox4News about her daughter. \u201cAnd her oxygen had already dropped all the way. There was pneumonia in both lungs. The doctor said that it looked like no pneumonia he\u2019d ever seen.\u201d\n\nLivingston\u2019s illness comes as health officials scramble to understand a wave of serious lung diseases afflicting more than 450 otherwise healthy people who use e-cigarettes, which mimic smoking by heating liquids with substances such as nicotine or marijuana. Six deaths have been attributed to vaping, and the Trump administration on Wednesday said it would move to ban most flavored e-cigarettes.\n\n[What we know about the mysterious vaping-linked illness and deaths]\n\nLivingston, a high school senior who works as a restaurant hostess, is being treated at a hospital in Dallas after she became sick about two weeks ago, Fox4News reported. At first, the report says, her symptoms resembled those of a stomach virus: a fever, a cough and rapid breathing.\n\nShe immediately knew what was happening. Livingston had read about a spate of vaping-related illnesses and deaths across the country, Fox4News reported, and she understood the risks of using the e-cigarettes. Doctors, however, are not sure that vaping caused Livingston\u2019s illness, CBS Dallas/Fort Worth reported.\n\nAudas told Fox4News that when her daughter revealed she had been smoking cigarettes, Audas had thought vaping would be a better alternative.\n\n\u201cYou think: cigarettes, you\u2019re going to get cancer, so this is much healthier,\u201d Audas told Fox4News. \u201cBecause that\u2019s the way it\u2019s portrayed.\u201d\n\nLivingston\u2019s health is improving, the news station reported, but the family is unsure of what lies ahead for her.\n\n[Trump moves to ban flavored e-cigarettes]\n\nAlthough e-cigarettes have been on the market for more than a decade, reports of illnesses accelerated this year after patients reported coughing, chest pain or shortness of breath. Many people have been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome, a life-threatening condition in which fluid builds up in the lungs.\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Hannah Knowles previously reported:\n\nOfficials are still trying to figure out what, exactly, is causing people to fall ill. They think chemicals are to blame. \u201cThe focus of our investigation is narrowing, and that is great news, but we are still faced with complex questions in this outbreak that will take time to answer,\u201d said Ileana Arias, CDC acting deputy director for noninfectious diseases. The nationwide investigation has found no particular vaping devices or products linked to all cases and is looking into potential contamination or counterfeit, as many victims report buying marijuana on the street rather than from a store.\n\nThe popularity of vaping has soared in recent years as young people in particular take to the practice. More than half of users are younger than 35 years old, according to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nUnder the Trump administration\u2019s proposal, the Food and Drug Administration would require companies to stop selling most flavored e-cigarettes until the FDA potentially approves them. Manufacturers of tobacco-flavored vaping devices would not have to come off the market and would have until May to file for approval.\n\nMichigan last week became the first state to ban flavored vaping devices, and New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) has promised to introduce a similar bill.\n\nRead more:\n\nA woman has been in a coma for weeks after using mercury-tainted skin cream\n\nSixth person dies of vaping-related illness\n\nOpioid crackdown forces pain patients to taper off drugs they say they need\n\nNew York to subpoena firms selling substances linked to illicit vaping products", "description": "The sudden decline in the Dallas teenager's health comes as health officials investigate more than 450 vaping-related illnesses nationwide.", "authors": ["Marisa Iati", "General Assignment", "Metro Reporter", "September At Am", "Marisa Iati Is A Reporter For The General Assignment News Desk", "The Metro Desk.
