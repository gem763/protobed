(AP) - A new law barring teenagers in Maryland from buying tobacco products like cigarettes and electronic cigarettes goes into effect Tuesday.\n\nNews outlets report the law will raise the age to purchase cigarettes, cigars and vaping products from 18 to 21 for all residents except active-duty military members. The bill passed this year, and lawmakers say it\u2019s an effort to prevent young people from getting hooked on nicotine. Fourteen other states have similar legislation.\n\nThe law goes into effect as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigates a mysterious lung illness among vapers, and the federal government moves to ban certain flavors that appeal to young people.\n\nThe Baltimore Sun reports enforcement will focus on sellers, not underage people who own the products. Retailers that break the law face fines.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A new law barring teenagers in Maryland from buying tobacco products like cigarettes and electronic cigarettes goes into effect Tuesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
