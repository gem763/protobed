But after he and his wife bought a house in Kensington in 1991, they noticed that trick or treating had become confined to Halloween night itself.\n\nWrote Andy: \u201cAt what point did trick or treating move back to the 31st? Did it happen gradually, or was there some sort of official decree that mandated the change?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nI wish I had a specific answer. Perhaps readers will share their memories. What I did find when I consulted old newspapers is a gradual evolution of the holiday and a slow erosion of the term Beggar\u2019s Night.\n\nAD\n\nA story in the Evening Star on Oct. 31, 1945, felt the need to explain what was going on: \u201cMany youngsters here and in nearby areas were active last night \u2014 \u2018beggar\u2019s night\u2019 to pranksters. A ring of the doorbell is followed by the warning of \u2018trick or treat.\u2019 The idea is that they must be given some kind of edible treat, else they will return tonight for devilment.\u201d\n\nStories in the \u201940s included admonitions from police against anything other than \u201cmild\u201d vandalism. The Bureau of Standards even released a statement on how to clean soap off windshields.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1998, The Post printed a letter from Mary Page Cobb of Fairfax, who noted that when she was young \u2014 she was born in 1929 \u2014 Beggar\u2019s Night was for treats.\n\n\u201cIf we did not receive one, on the next night, Halloween, we would \u2018trick\u2019 that household,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAll very innocent \u2014 moving lawn furniture a block down the street, soaping windows, leaving stink bombs on porches (homemade, nonchemical, nonexplosive types) and moving outhouses.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBeggar\u2019s Night seemed to be a regional thing, a fixture in Washington and such cities as Des Moines. At some point, the days merged into one. The pranks subsided while the candy-acquisition grew.\n\nWhat hasn\u2019t changed is the irritation some adults feel about Halloween. As far back as the 1940s there were lively arguments in newspapers\u2019 letters sections about the suitability of Beggar\u2019s Night/Halloween.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the threat involved in the youngsters\u2019 begging,\u201d wrote Mrs. B.W. of Kensington to the Evening Star in 1948.\n\nAs late as 1967, a writer to the Star \u2014 Mrs. C.C.B. \u2014 was saying that before moving to Washington she\u2019d never heard of trick or treat, adding, \u201cDoes anyone else feel as I do that we are encouraging our children to expect something for nothing out of life?\u201d\n\nMrs. F.G.L. of Lanham wrote to say she, too, deplored Halloween: \u201cMy husband and I have never allowed our children to go out begging, but we try to make it a special night in the home.\u201d That included donning costumes and carving jack o\u2019 lanterns.\n\nAD\n\nI bet the kids were thrilled.\n\nAD\n\nNot everyone was down on Halloween. A reader who signed herself \u201cGrandmother\u201d wrote: \u201cDear Mrs. C.C.B. \u2014 What\u2019s an old witch like you doing at home on Halloween? You should be out on your broom making a clean sweep of the neighborhood.\u201d\n\nA pumpkin prank\n\nIn 2015 I wrote about a WSSC water tower near Georgia Avenue just inside the Beltway. It was big, round and painted in orange primer. On Oct. 29, 1969, the words \u201cTHE GREAT PUMPKIN\u201d mysteriously appeared on its side. Even after it was repainted light blue, the letters were visible \u2014 and still are today, if you look closely.\n\nWho did it? Well, the other day I heard from Wayne Powell, executive director of the National Fire Heritage Center in Emmitsburg, Md., and a historian of firefighting in Silver Spring. He reminded me that Station 19 is a block from the water tower. He didn\u2019t need to remind me that since buildings spend most of their time not on fire, firefighters have a lot of down time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWayne said that one night, Preston Wheeler, the station\u2019s captain, directed the firemen to cut three-foot-high letters out of black construction paper. Then they boarded their American LaFrance truck \u2014 with its 100-foot ladder \u2014 and headed to the water tank.\n\n\u201cRather than doing an evening drill, they decided to make that the drill,\u201d Wayne said. \u201cIt was used basically as a training exercise.\u201d\n\nThe prank made the news. WSSC peeled off the letters when it put its final coat on the tank, but the glue continues to make the words legible.\n\nNow if someone would just cop to painting \u201cSurrender Dorothy\u201d on the nearby CSX bridge.\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.\n\nAD", "description": "The annual celebration of juvenile extortion used to be spread over two days.", "authors": ["John Kelly", "Local Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xxWVR0rIyDyf2iUmlg6WvRL-YTM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KEVPDJH3GQI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
