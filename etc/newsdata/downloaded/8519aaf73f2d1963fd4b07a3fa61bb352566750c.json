Registration for the lottery must be completed by 5 p.m. Friday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWinners of the ticket purchase opportunity drawing will be notified on or about Saturday, October 19 with a purchase link and password that can be used to purchase up to two (2) tickets for each possible 2019 World Series game at Nationals Park,\u201d the email read.\n\nFans who purchased at least one ticket to any of the Nationals\u2019 home games in the National League Championship Series \u2014 including Game 5, which wasn\u2019t necessary \u2014 through the team will be given the opportunity to purchase up to two single-game tickets for each World Series home game in a presale Friday at 10 a.m. Those fans will receive an email with detailed purchase instructions Friday morning, and all tickets are subject to availability.\n\nAdditionally, a limited number of World Series tickets, at discounted plan-holder prices, are available to fans who purchase a new 2020 Nats Plus full- or half-season plan. The cheapest half-season Nats Plus plan for 2020 is $840.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSeason ticket holders who renewed for the 2020 season were previously given the opportunity to purchase the number of tickets in their plan for the entire postseason. On Tuesday, Nats Plus members were emailed a link to a presale with the opportunity to purchase up to four additional single-game tickets for each of the Nationals\u2019 three possible World Series home games, again subject to availability. As was the case with last year\u2019s All-Star Game at Nationals Park, some of the ticket inventory for the World Series goes to Major League Baseball \u2014 about 20 percent, according to an MLB spokesman. Participating teams choose how to distribute their World Series tickets. More information is available on the Nationals\u2019 website.\n\nPlan-holder prices for World Series tickets range from $155 for upper gallery seats to $470 for DeltaSky360 front-row seats. Box office (presale) prices for the same sections range from $285 to $660, according to materials the Nationals sent to plan holders, while standing-room-only tickets are priced at $269. The Nationals have not announced plans to make any additional World Series tickets available to the general public beyond this week\u2019s presales and the lottery.\n\nGiven the limited number of tickets the Nationals have made available to those who aren\u2019t plan holders \u2014 and the fact that D.C. hasn\u2019t hosted a World Series since 1933 \u2014 the asking price for tickets on the secondary market is exorbitant. As of Thursday afternoon, the cheapest standing-room-only tickets to Game 3 on StubHub and SeatGeek were $819 and $725, respectively. Those prices probably will come down over the next week, especially if the Nationals face the Astros instead of the Yankees. By comparison, the cheapest tickets on the secondary market for potential Game 1s in New York and Houston were roughly $680 and $400, respectively, as of Thursday afternoon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 subreddit features a useful thread about this topic, and one user created a shared Google Sheet for buying, selling and trading World Series tickets.\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nAD", "description": "Fans need to register by Friday afternoon for a random drawing for the opportunity to purchase World Series tickets.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
