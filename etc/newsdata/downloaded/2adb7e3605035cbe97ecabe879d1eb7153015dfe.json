You only have to win three on the trot and before you know it, you\u2019re back in the top-four race and that\u2019s what they\u2019re in.\u201d", "description": "Manchester United currently find themselves seven points behind Chelsea, who occupy the final Champions League qualification spot", "authors": ["Alex Harris", "Image", "Joe Toth Bpi Rex", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14130277.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Paul-Merson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
