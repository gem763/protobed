Months later her parents learned why.", "language": "en", "text": "To distract her, Jeannette opened the door of the family\u2019s truck. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get in and buckle up,\u201d she remembers saying. Tiana took particular delight in clambering into her car seat and fastening her seat belt.\n\nNot this time.\n\nThe little girl seemed rooted to the ground, impervious to her mother's encouragement. \"It wasn't that she wouldn't [comply],\" Jeannette recalled of the 2015 incident. \"I could tell she just couldn't.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLater that afternoon, she mentioned Tiana's difficulties to the physical therapist who had been working with the little girl for more than a year to try to overcome her significant, unexplained developmental delays.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t normal, to regress after so many months of therapy,\u201d Jeannette, now 37, remembers the therapist telling her. She mentioned a disorder Jeannette had never heard of and suggested it might be the cause.\n\nJeannette did a quick search, dismissed the possibility and said she \u201cforgot about it.\u201d\n\nBut the first anguished words she blurted out nearly a half-year later on that shattering day in the specialist\u2019s office when she learned what was wrong, was that the therapist had been right.\n\nAD\n\nNonstop crying\n\nWithin weeks following Tiana\u2019s normal birth in May 2013, it was clear that she would not be as easy to care for as her sister, Aliyah, who is two years older.\n\nAD\n\nThe toughest part was her incessant crying. Jeannette and her husband, Victor, a communications technology engineer, tried everything: white noise machines, co-sleeping, colic remedies, swaddling, a vibration device. Nothing worked. Tiana rarely slept more than two hours at a stretch.\n\nJeannette remembers crying herself as she held up the phone so that Victor, who traveled often for work, could hear their daughter shrieking.\n\nShe relied on weekly emails from a popular website that ticked off developmental milestones and noticed that Tiana was slow to reach them.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTiana was rarely on schedule,\u201d she recalled. \u201cOr she would hit them and then lose them.\u201d The toddler spoke late and only a few simple words such as \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cbye.\u201d Then she inexplicably stopped talking.\n\nJeannette said she didn\u2019t worry about the regressions. \u201cI assumed if she did it once, she would do it again,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nVictor counseled patience. \u201cI thought, \u2018Well, some kids are a little slower. She\u2019ll catch up.\u2019 \u201d The Vegas say their pediatrician in nearby Huntsville didn\u2019t seem alarmed.\n\nBut after Tiana proved to be months late learning to sit without assistance, Jeannette took a friend\u2019s advice and enrolled the 13-month-old in Alabama\u2019s early intervention program. The in-home program provides speech, occupational and physical therapy for developmentally delayed and disabled children.\n\nAD\n\nTiana improved \u2014 but very slowly. Sometime after she turned 2 she began to walk, an accomplishment her parents celebrated.\n\n\u201cIt made us feel like everything is going to be okay and that she was catching up,\u201d her mother said.\n\nBut several disturbing occurrences belied what seemed like progress.\n\nPuzzling regression\n\nAround the time Tiana was unable to climb into her car seat, the Vegas noticed that the little girl was grinding her teeth. She also appeared to have brief staring spells, which might signal epilepsy. Her pediatrician referred her to Martina Bebin, a pediatric neurologist in Huntsville and a professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe came with a nondescript presentation,\u201d Bebin recalled. Tiana had no diagnosis and Bebin suspected that as many as 15 disparate conditions, including epilepsy or autism might be the cause. Brain scans, genetic screens and chromosomal analysis failed to pinpoint what was wrong.\n\nBut the Vegas\u2019 timing turned out to be fortuitous.\n\nBebin was an integral part of a newly launched collaboration between the University of Alabama and the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville, a nonprofit that conducts genetic research. The goal of the project, known as CSER, (short for Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research) was to determine whether whole genome sequencing could identify disorders in children with neurological difficulties who had no diagnosis. The Alabama site, which enrolled about 500 children and their parents, uncovered a diagnosis in more than 150 children. CSER is funded by the National Institutes of Health; HudsonAlpha is one of several sites around the country.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe can very rapidly winnow down a possible cause, particularly in children with de novo [spontaneous] genetic variants,\u201d said Greg Cooper, a Stanford-trained geneticist and HudsonAlpha scientist who headed its CSER effort. Blood samples from both parents and the affected child can yield information about genetic variations that are not inherited.\n\nThe Vegas enrolled, then waited for the results.\n\nDuring the nearly six-month hiatus, the couple decided to take their daughter to a psychologist for evaluation. Maybe, they thought, she could make a diagnosis.\n\nVictor said he suspected by then that his daughter might be autistic. He had relatives with autism, and Tiana had recently developed repetitive and purposeless hand movements similar to those he had seen in some people with the disorder. He and Jeannette began talking to parents of autistic children in an attempt to prepare themselves.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey also decided to move back to Orlando, where their families live.\n\nDevastating news\n\nIn early December 2015, the day before their move to Florida, the couple met with Cooper and other members of the HudsonAlpha team to get Tiana\u2019s results. Only a day earlier, the psychologist had told the Vegas she believed Tiana had autism.\n\nBut the team\u2019s news was deeply shocking \u2014 and far worse than either expected.\n\nCooper explained that genetic sequencing had revealed a mutation in the MECP2 gene, which is necessary for brain function. The mutation is associated with Rett Syndrome, a degenerative and incurable neurodevelopmental disorder that almost exclusively affects girls.\n\nAD\n\nIt was the malady her physical therapist had, months earlier, speculated might be the cause of the little girl\u2019s difficulties.\n\nFirst described in 1966 by Austrian physician Andreas Rett, the gene associated with Rett, which impairs brain development, was identified in 1999. The x-linked mutation, which occurs randomly, is estimated to affect roughly 1 in 10,000 girls in the United States. (Affected boys are rare and seldom survive infancy.) The syndrome is characterized by regressions in speech and motor coordination, often during the first 18 months of life. Cognitive functioning can be hard to assess because of the inability to speak or gesture. Many girls with Rett develop stereotypical \u201chandwashing\u201d movements.\n\nAD\n\nAlthough Rett can be diagnosed based on symptoms, Cooper said that a genetic test offers \u201cclosure and certainty.\u201d Because it is caused by a spontaneous mutation, scientists believe that the chance of future children having Rett is extremely small.\n\nGirls with Rett appear to have a reduced life span, although they may live into their 40s and beyond. Treatment is largely supportive and focuses on managing problems such as difficulty eating, the loss of muscle control and the inability to speak.\n\nFor Jeannette, the news seemed to foretell a future that sounded inexpressibly bleak. \u201cI spent the first 24 to 48 hours vomiting and crying,\u201d she recalled.\n\nThe diagnosis was equally leveling for Victor, who said he particularly appreciated the HudsonAlpha team\u2019s kindness as they patiently answered questions from the stunned couple and provided guidance and valuable referrals.\n\nAD\n\nAt first, he said, his frequent business trips were \u201ca good distraction. But then I started losing it in hotel rooms.\u201d He remembers nights spent lying on the floor weeping inconsolably and feeling utterly unable to protect his family.\n\nBut in time, having a definitive diagnosis and connecting to resources including pediatric neurologist Alan Percy, one of the world\u2019s preeminent Rett experts at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, helped the couple move forward.\n\n\u201cI give the family a lot of credit. They were really proactive and are extremely resilient. And they\u2019ve tapped into what\u2019s going on in terms of research,\u201d Bebin said.\n\n\u201cThe genetics counselor getting us connected to other families who have Rett \u2014 it was life-changing,\u201d Jeannette said.\n\nAfter 18 months in Orlando, the Vegas moved back to Madison, in part because of the proximity to care for Tiana and the support of other families.\n\nVictor said he particularly tries to reach out to affected fathers. \u201cIt can feel lonely when you feel like you\u2019re going through this all by yourself.\u201d\n\nIn the past few years, life seems to have stabilized, Jeannette said.\n\nTiana is attending a local elementary school with a full-time aide. Because of her significant difficulty eating, she now has a feeding tube that has enabled her to gain weight, and improved her strength and energy. She sleeps through the night and uses an eye gaze communication device, which permits people to communicate by tracking eye movements. She seems happy, her mother says, and loves roller coasters and riding her adaptive tricycle.\n\nAlthough grateful for a diagnosis, Jeannette says she does not wish Tiana had been diagnosed earlier.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine with when we got the diagnosis,\u201d she said. \u201cFinding an answer was a huge help, but I feel like those days would have been 10 times harder if we had known.\u201d", "description": "A toddler\u2019s puzzling regressions foreshadowed a devastating diagnosis.", "authors": ["Sandra G.
