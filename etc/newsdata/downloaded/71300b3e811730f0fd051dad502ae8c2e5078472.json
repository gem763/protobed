Some helpful tips on how to navigate through life when you loose someone close to you.\n\nHow to deal with grief and the loss of a loved one 00:20:39\n\nThe last morning Karen would ever spend with her kids started like any other.\n\nMorgan, a nine-year-old who suffered from severe epileptic seizures, and Logan, who was eight, had to be up early - even though it was the last day of school before the Thanksgiving holiday in November 2011.\n\nThe American mum-of-three let her youngest son Luke, a six-year-old who was autistic, stay in bed because he was already on holidays.\n\nKaren remembers sitting on his bed and telling him he would be spending the holiday with his dad \u2013 who would fly a plane to collect them later.\n\n\u201cUnclothed, he jumped up and down cheerfully announcing, \u2018Yeah I LOVE THANKSGIVING!\u2019,\u201d Karen first wrote on Still Standing Magazine.\n\n\u201cI said goodbye to them all later that day.\n\n\u201cLogan almost went out that night without saying goodbye. I told him to get back in the house and give me a hug and kiss, with no knowledge of what was yet to come.\u201d\n\nKaren with her three kids - Logan, Morgan and Luke. Source: Supplied\n\n\"It was a pitch-black night\"\n\nAs Karen, who suffers from endometriosis, wasn\u2019t feeling well, her nanny Jaleesa drove the three kids to a nearby private airport where her ex-husband Shawn was waiting in the small plane.\n\nBoth Karen and Shawn had worked for years as commercial pilots \u2013 it was where they had first met.\n\nShawn now worked for an aviation fire fighting company - and would be flying down in a small plane to collect the kids for the weekend.\n\nAs Karen would later watch in security footage, her kids greeted their dad around 6pm that night as the plane refuelled.\n\n\u201cWhile boarding the plane, Morgan created a scene and did not want to get on onboard,\u201d Karen said.\n\n\u201cShawn, to calm her, sat in the back of the aircraft with the children. They took off. It was a pitch-black night with no moon or visible horizon.\u201d\n\nThe three kids were the most important thing in Karen's life. Source: Supplied\n\n\"Karen, there has been a plane crash!\u201d\n\nKaren woke up about an hour later, wondering why the kids hadn\u2019t texted her to let her know that they had arrived like they normally did.\n\nShe sent a short text to Shawn to ask if everyone was OK but didn\u2019t get a response.\n\nThe next thing Karen knew the phone was ringing off the hook.\n\nNo one ever used the house phone so she ignored it \u2013 but the person kept calling back.\n\n\u201cI was annoyed because I was trying to rest \u2013 what could possibly be that important?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt was my nanny, Jaleesa. She was crying.\n\n\u201cKaren, there has been a plane crash!\n\n\u201cI was thinking to myself, 'OK, so planes crash every day, why are you telling me this?'\u201d\n\nThe kids were spending the Thanksgiving holiday with their dad. Source: Supplied\n\n\"This has to be some kind of mistake\"\n\nIt took Karen a few minutes to piece together the fact that her kids and ex had been on the plane that crashed.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t make sense of the fact that no one had contacted her to let her know what was going on.\n\n\"I stumbled out of bed, dizzy and stunned,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be true, I thought. It just can\u2019t be. This has to be some kind of mistake.\n\n\u201cThe ceiling seemed to swirl around my head, and the news hit me like ten thousand bullets.\n\n\u201cMy only thought was 'MY KIDS ARE DEAD!'\u201d\n\nWithin six minutes, Karen lost her entire family. Source: Supplied\n\n\"Just six minutes after take-off\"\n\nAbout an hour later, people started showing up at Karen\u2019s house.\n\nThrough the crowd, Karen led the police into her living room.\n\nThey informed her that they were currently searching for survivors in the plane wreck \u2013 it had crashed just six minutes after take-off.\n\n\u201cThey asked me lots of questions,\u201d Karen said.\n\n\u201cI explained the custody arrangement that Shawn and I had.\n\n\u201cHe would get the children every other weekend. Usually, he would fly to Mesa, from Safford, to pick up the kids and then would drive them home on Sunday.\u201d\n\nTragically, no one survived the crash. Source: Supplied\n\n\u201cI knew it was Morgan\"\n\nKaren and Shawn\u2019s divorce and custody battle had not been easy.\n\nHe had bitterly fought to take custody of the kids \u2013 and had been disappointed by the arrangement that only let me see them every other weekend.\n\nPolice prepared Karen to face the possibility that her ex had intentionally crashed the plane as a result.\n\nBut before she could able to process this \u2013 a child was confirmed dead in the crash.\n\n\u201cWhat was Morgan wearing?\u201d Karen recalled being asked.\n\n\u201cThey said that the dead child was possibly a female about nine years old. I knew it was Morgan.\n\n\u201cHours later it was confirmed that the bodies of all six had been accounted for, and there were NO SURVIVORS.\u201d\n\nJust hours earlier the kids had all been at Karen's house. Source: Supplied\n\n\"I am not equipped to deal with this\"\n\nKaren sat in the living room that just hours ago had been filled with the activity of her three kids.\n\nTheir bags and shoes lay scattered by the door, the jacket she asked Logan to take was still on the shoe rack.\n\nIt seemed impossible that they were gone.\n\n\u201cSo many times, I would ask God, \u2018Why me? I am not equipped to deal with this\u2019,\u201d Karen said.\n\n\u201cI was dazed, confused, and could barely move because it felt as though cement had been poured all over my body.\n\n\u201cAll I have left of my children are my memories and three small black boxes of ashes perched on a shelf in my bedroom closet.\u201d\n\nNow Karen had to plan her precious kids' funerals.
