What do they accomplish that existing laws don\u2019t already do? What concerns should law-abiding Americans have about them?\n\nThese are the types of questions that must be explored in depth, with reasoned analysis and absent knee-jerk conclusions.\n\nQ: What are red flag laws?\n\nA: The specifics of red flag laws vary by jurisdiction, and no two red flag laws are identical. As a general rule, these laws allow non-state actors (family members, teachers, etc.) to request that a hearing be held on whether someone close to them should have his or her right to possess firearms temporarily revoked because he or she is an extreme risk of danger to self or others.\n\nSome states only allow those private individuals to ask law enforcement officers to investigate and file petitions with courts, while other states allow them to petition the courts directly.\n\nThe goal of these laws is to better identify individuals who are becoming increasing dangerous and take steps to temporarily disarm (and, if appropriate, treat) them before they can harm themselves or anyone else.\n\nThese laws have become increasingly popular since the February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, even though the first such law was enacted by Connecticut in 1999. Today, 17 states plus the District of Columbia have passed some form of red flag legislation.\n\nQ: What\u2019s wrong with current laws?\n\nA: Federal law currently prohibits individuals from possessing firearms if they have been convicted of a felony or domestic-violence misdemeanor, have an active restraining order against them, or have been committed to a mental health institution.\n\nThe problem is that very few mass public shooters have disqualifying criminal convictions or mental health histories that prevent them from legally purchasing firearms, even though they often display many signs of being a serious risk of danger to themselves or others.\n\nFurther, not all mass public shooters have a diagnosable mental illness, and therefore can\u2019t be disarmed through civil commitment procedures.\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s a gap in existing laws where objectively dangerous people are still permitted to lawfully purchase and possess guns because they have not yet reached a mental health crisis or committed an atrocity.\n\nPart of the problem is that civil commitments are a legally intensive process with serious (and often lifelong) implications for the person being committed. They are, therefore, often reserved as a last resort when all else has failed.\n\nRed flag laws can provide an intermediate \u201cgap-filler\u201d option for situations where someone is clearly becoming a serious threat to himself or the public, but has not yet committed a serious crime or falls outside the scope of existing laws.\n\nMoreover, red flag laws can allow non-state actors to play a more significant role in alerting law enforcement officials and courts to the dangers posed by individuals who may otherwise \u201cfly under the radar.\u201d\n\nFriends, family members, and co-workers are often well-positioned to recognize when an individual is becoming an extreme risk of danger and have been instrumental in preventing mass public attacks.\n\nQ: What about the Second Amendment?\n\nA: The Second Amendment protects the right of law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms commonly used for lawful purposes. This right is fundamental to our \u201cscheme of ordered liberty\u201d and antithetical to broad prohibitions on civilian firearm access or the imposition of significant burdens on the exercise of the right.\n\nLike all other enumerated rights, however, the right to keep and bear arms is not unlimited. No one would seriously suggest that violent criminals maintain a Second Amendment right while serving their sentence of imprisonment, or that individuals involuntarily committed to psychiatric facilities must be permitted to keep firearms in their hospital rooms.\n\nAs the Supreme Court has inferred, certain prohibitions on possessing firearms are \u201cpresumptively lawful\u201d for convicted felons or the mentally ill.\n\nThe Supreme Court has not further explained the reason for why these prohibitions are presumptively lawful, but the text, history, and tradition of the Second Amendment do support a narrow premise for the temporary disarmament of dangerous individuals.\n\nWhere the facts and circumstances give specific reason to believe that a person is likely to cause imminent unlawful harm to himself or others, the person may be disarmed until he can reassure the community that he does not pose a violent threat.\n\nOf course, the Constitution also demands that such individuals receive meaningful due process protections prior to the restriction of their rights, and great pains should be taken to ensure that individuals cannot be punished for merely holding offensive views or engaging in objectionable, but nonviolent, behaviors.\n\nThe danger of abuse, however, is not unique to red flag laws. All laws\u2014including criminal laws, civil commitment laws, and laws allowing for the imposition of restraining orders\u2014can be misused or misapplied to harass disfavored groups.\n\nThe proper solution to the risk of laws being improperly applied is not to avoid laws altogether, but to craft laws narrowly, to afford effective oversight and accountability, and to provide meaningful remedies in cases of abuse.\n\nAll of this can be accomplished in a red flag framework.\n\nQ: Could red flag laws have stopped previous shootings?\n\nA: Unlike other commonly proposed gun control measures, red-flag laws could have been used to prevent many high-profile mass public shootings without broadly infringing on the rights of all lawful gun owners.\n\nFor example, the parents of the man who killed six people and wounded 13 in Tucson, Arizona, in 2011 were so worried about his mental health, they disabled his car and tried to hide his firearms. They tried unsuccessfully to get him mental health treatment.\n\nA red flag law would have given these parents a means to petition a court for help without relying on county attorneys, and their son could have been disarmed and steered toward treatment before he reached a breaking point.\n\nSimilarly, red flag laws could have prevented the Parkland, Florida, shooting by allowing the family with whom the shooter was staying to petition a court for disarmament after local law enforcement and school officials refused to take action, despite repeated indications that the shooter was dangerous.\n\nNo one seriously suggests that any one piece of legislation could provide an easy fix to all mass public shootings, and red flag laws are certainly not a complete answer.\n\nThey are, however, a potentially important tool in the broader toolbox for combating gun-related violence in the United States, and can be paired with other important measures, such as those addressing untreated mental health issues or increasing the ability of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves in public places.\n\nQ: What makes a good red-flag law?\n\nA: Laws that restrict an individual\u2019s right to keep and bear arms, even temporarily, must follow some important guidelines.\n\nTo be unobjectionable, red flag laws should, among other considerations:\n\nUse narrow definitions of \u201cdangerousness\u201d that are based on objective criteria and that don\u2019t treat factors such as lawful firearm ownership or political affiliation as presumptively suspicious;\n\nBe temporary in nature, limited only to the period of time the person remains a danger to himself or others, and provide for the prompt restoration of firearms and corresponding rights when the danger no longer exists;\n\nAfford strong due process protections, including high burdens of proof (i.e., \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d), cross-examination rights, and the right to counsel.\n\nProvide meaningful remedies for those who are maliciously and falsely accused, and expunge any records of petitions that are not granted;\n\nBe integrated with existing mental health and addiction systems to ensure that people who are deemed to be dangerous because of underlying factors receive the treatment they need.\n\nResearch is limited, but what we do have shows that red flag laws are not used as sweeping gun-confiscation measures. Rather, they effectively target a small class of individuals who are dangerous but can\u2019t otherwise be reached under existing mental health or criminal laws.\n\nImportantly, the available evidence suggests that judges do not merely rubber-stamp petitions, especially when adequate due process protections are implemented.\n\nStudies of red flag laws in Connecticut and Maryland show that in a significant percentage of cases, petitions are either not granted in the first place, or petitions that were initially granted are rescinded upon further review, and the person\u2019s firearms are returned.\n\nQ: Aren\u2019t red flag laws dangerous for law enforcement?\n\nA: Certainly, law enforcement officers may face violent threats while serving red flag orders and seizing firearms from individuals determined to be dangerous under these laws.\n\nHowever, law enforcement officers often respond to dangerous situations during the normal course of their duties, and there\u2019s no practical difference between executing a red flag seizure, serving a normal arrest warrant, or taking someone into emergency protective custody when he or she is in the middle of a mental health crisis.\n\nIn fact, red flag laws may help reduce the overall risk to law enforcement by allowing mentally unstable or dangerous people to be identified and disarmed prior to the point where they are actively engaged in violent behaviors directed toward themselves or others.\n\nBy disarming these individuals and rerouting them toward proper treatment or other appropriate intervention before they reach a crisis stage, police officers and communities are ultimately safer from potentially volatile situations, not less safe.\n\nQ: Where can I find out more about red flag laws?\n\nA: The Heritage Foundation has previously written about red-flag laws here:", "description": "The national gun control conversation often sounds like a broken record, with the same advocates resorting to the same talking points about decades-old proposals, such as banning so-called \u201cassault weapons\u201d or imposing universal background checks.", "authors": ["Amy Swearer", "Senior Legal Policy Analyst", "Amy Is A Senior Legal Policy Analyst In The Meese Center For Legal", "Judicial Studies."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-09/Red%20flag.jpg?itok=x3iC5iVv"}
