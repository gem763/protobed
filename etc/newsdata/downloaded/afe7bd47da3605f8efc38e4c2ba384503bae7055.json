Strike Was the Best and the Worst of the Labor Movement", "language": "en", "text": "Robert Tancredi, who was a commercial printer in Philadelphia before joining the G.M. warehouse, told me that before the strike, workers on different shifts hardly knew one another. Nor did they have the time, or motivation, to mull the larger context of their labor: temps and \u201cpermalancers,\u201d unjust tiers of pay and benefits, automation, overcompensated executives and the elusiveness of \u201cmiddle class\u201d life.\n\nMr. Tancredi and his co-workers in Local 2177 debated these ideas, and not only with one another. People from the surrounding community, including young activists with the Democratic Socialists of America, came to the strike line every day to offer moral support, pizza, firewood and groceries for hard-up families. Caravans of fellow unionists, from teachers to construction workers, came too, from as far away as New York, recognizing that the issues being negotiated at G.M. affect us all.\n\nBeyond the final contract, a key measure of the strike\u2019s success will be the extent to which U.A.W. members build on the memory of this organizing \u2014 to demand more of G.M., to be sure, but also one another and the leaders of the union.\n\nWorkers once employed at the Lordstown plant vowed to fight the tentative agreement. Others, less sure, are meeting with their co-workers to go through the proposals carefully. \u201cAfter five weeks, both sides are ready to end this,\u201d Dave Greenhalgh, the union benefits representative for Local 2177, told me.\n\nWhile interviewing striking workers, I thought about how many of us in media and politics have rehearsed the same refrain since the election of 2016: that manufacturing jobs are the most wholesome, inviolable kind of work, a family-sustaining, career-making, nation-saving platonic ideal of labor.\n\nBut the employees on strike at G.M. haven\u2019t all had this experience. They operate robots and pick boxes off warehouse shelves. Some are temps and earn just above the minimum wage, while others, having joined the company decades ago, are entitled to someday collect pensions.\n\nAll of them know that their wages and benefits and the very fact of their jobs are subject to change. They are threatened by automation and constant offshoring, as well as a corporate structure that \u2014 without the union\u2019s counterbalance \u2014 would move money only upward into executive hands.\n\nTheir fight is one that all of us, regardless of the work we do, should claim as our own.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
