To access FX markets, savers will have to submit a sworn declaration stating they won\u2019t buy bonds within that timeframe.\n\nThe rule aims to curb arbitrage operations used by savers to profit from the return of capital controls, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The measures are expected to be published shortly, as central bank officials and officials from the securities regulator discuss the finer points, according to another person.\n\nThe move follows a decision to bring back capital controls, a drastic measure taken by President Mauricio Macri after his poor showing in a presidential primary vote sparked a plunge by the peso and a drop in government reserves along with it. Argentine savers, who can buy as much as $10,000 per month, soon found arbitrage opportunities in bond prices, which they called \u201cel rulo\u201d or \u201cthe curl.\u201d\n\nForeign investors, meanwhile, use bonds that trade locally and abroad to take their dollars abroad, through an operation known as the \u201cblue-chip swap rate.\u201d\n\nThe central bank also conducted exchange house inspections Wednesday to ensure they comply with the new currency rules, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ignacio Olivera Doll in Buenos Aires at ioliveradoll@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Carolina Millan at cmillanronch@bloomberg.net, ;Daniel Cancel at dcancel@bloomberg.net, Robert Jameson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Argentina\u2019s central bank is adding measures to curb trades aimed at profiting from capital controls.Argentina\u2019s central bank will require individual investors who buy dollars to hold those greenbacks for at least five days before they can buy bonds in the secondary market, according to", "authors": ["Ignacio Olivera Doll"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Japga34P8YkbjZaCrrc4YQ--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/83af78f3016ed7b390ff1138348ced3e", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
