And what will happen to our staff? We must now come to our senses and wake from this two decades-long bad dream,\u201d Rensburg said.\n\nCity Press has also seen a submission from the National Education, Health and Allied Workers\u2019 Union (Nehawu) to Pityana.\n\nZide and Hlapolose were sent emails requesting their submissions, but they had not responded at the time of writing.\n\nIn his submission to Pityana, which City Press has seen, the unwanted executive alleged he was acquitted.\n\n\u201cMy disciplinary hearing took place in July 2017, after Professor Zide had assumed duties as vice-chancellor,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAfter being acquitted, he alleged that the VUT wrote to his attorney, saying it would communicate further about his return to work.\n\n\u201cI was never called back to resume work until my contract expired on August 31 2017. It became clear to me that this was a ploy by Professor Zide that I should be kept off campus so that by the time my contract expired, I should still be off campus \u2013 as if my constitutional rights to fair labour practice would cease if I were to be kept off campus,\u201d said the executive.\n\nBut in his submission, he alleged that he had been on a month-to-month contract since them.\n\nThe other executive, also known to City Press, had been suspended for 18 months on full pay.\n\n\u201cI have noticed that the vice-chancellor and his group do not want me at the university since my disciplinary hearing is always postponed till to date [sic] (I can provide a video and emails to prove that they go around speaking that they don\u2019t want me to work at VUT),\u201d he wrote in his submission.\n\n\u201cMy intention is to resign from this university because I received an email from the chairperson of the union, threatening my life. To my surprise, he copied both the vice-chancellor and the chairperson of council, and nothing has been done to him. (I have the email.)\u201d\n\nThe executive added that he had evidence to back up his claims.\n\n\u201cMy intention is to give this process a chance to reveal nothing but the truth to the VUT community. But should the process fail us, I will be left with no choice but to contact the Hawks and expose everything in my possession.\u201d\n\nNehawu said in its submission that the then council was \u201cnonfunctional, factional and not progressive in addressing the academic agenda of the institution\u201d.\n\nIn his assessment briefing to the VUT community, Rensburg said the institution lacked a coherent strategic direction: \u201cIt is deeply faction-ridden, and this has enabled rogues to capture and to paralyse procurement, infrastructure projects and staff appointments. In many instances, recruitment policies had not been followed, resulting in people being appointed informally. Moreover, there are reported instances of people being hired in exchange for sexual favours.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Rensburg said, the VUT had become a last resort for prospective students, and success rates were in decline.\n\nSince his appointment, he said, he had approved the VUT\u2019s strategic plan, which in part identified actions to be implemented urgently, including:\n\nVUT\u2019s strategic plan, which in part identified actions to be implemented urgently Improving student success by implementing early warning and tracking systems;\n\nRehabilitating student residences;\n\nReviewing and phasing out unfeasible academic programmes;\n\nReviewing the viability of satellite campuses and responsible closure;\n\nFilling critical vacant posts; and\n\nInstituting disciplinary action against staff implicated in corruption and fraud in procurement and human resources.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Taxpayers have paid millions of rands for two \u201cunwanted\u201d executives at the Vaal University of Technology (VUT) who were allegedly forced by the university to stay at home.", "authors": ["Msindisi Fengu"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9200/7674150b98be432fa00cbe0a6b84369f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
