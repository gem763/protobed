Getty\n\nA court in southern Bangladesh sentenced 16 people to death on Thursday for the killing of a young woman in a horrific attack earlier this year. Nusrat Jahan Rafi, 19, was set on fire on April 6 after she and her family refused to withdraw sexual harassment charges against the principal of the Islamic school she attended.\n\nShe died of her injuries four days later, sparking widespread protests across the South Asian nation and prompting Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to promise speedy justice.\n\nThe principal of the seminary, Siraj Ud Doula, against whom Rafi filed the criminal harassment complaint, was among the people sentenced to death by the special court in Feni, about 100 miles southeast of Bangladesh's capital Dhaka.\n\nPolice said Doula ordered the murder from prison, where he was being held after his arrest on Rafi's complaint.\n\nTwo politicians of the ruling Awami League, Ruhul Amin and Maksud Alam, were also among those sentenced to death. The others were two teachers and 11 students \u2014 two of them female \u2014 at the Islamic school, or madrasa.\n\nBangladeshi media said there was anger and wailing in the courtroom when the verdict was delivered. All 16 of the accused and their family members were present in the court, which was surrounded by police.\n\n\"The verdict proves that nobody will get away with murder in Bangladesh. We have the rule of law,\" prosecutor Hafez Ahmed said after the ruling was announced.\n\nThe convicted murderers were expected to appeal their sentences to a higher court in the country.\n\nA brutal murder\n\nRafi registered a police complaint against the principal in March, alleging that he had called her into his office and touched her inappropriately.

She was then tied up with a scarf, doused in kerosene and set on fire.\n\n\"The plan was to pass the incident off as a suicide. But it fell through after Rafi managed to come downstairs while on fire because the scarf burned and freed her hands and feet,\" Iqbal told AFP.\n\nIn a video statement recorded by her brother as she was driven to the hospital, Rafi is heard saying, \"The teacher touched me inappropriately. I will fight this crime till my last breath.\" She named some of her attackers in the video.\n\nRafi sustained burns over 80% of her body and died at Dhaka Medical College Hospital on April 10.\n\nBangladeshi women hold banners and photographs of Nusrat Jahan Rafi at a protest in Dhaka, Bangladesh, April 12, 2019, following her murder after she had reported a sexual assault.
