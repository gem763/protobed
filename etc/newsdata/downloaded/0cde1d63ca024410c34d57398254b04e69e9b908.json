They include:\n\nNational Gallery of Canada (Ottawa)\n\nCanadian Museum of History (Gatineau, Que.)\n\nCanadian War Museum (Ottawa)\n\nCanadian Museum of Nature (Ottawa)\n\nCanadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 (Halifax, N.S.)\n\nCanadian Museum for Human Rights (Winnipeg, Man.)\n\nCanada Science and Technology Museum (Ottawa)\n\nCanada Aviation and Space Museum (Ottawa)\n\nCanada Agriculture Museum (Ottawa)\n\nThe Parliamentary Budget Officer says eliminating these facilities' admission fees would cost about $20 million in 2020-2021 and rise to $22 million a decade from now.\n\nScheer also is promising to designate the RCMP Heritage Centre in Regina, which celebrates the history of the national police force, as a national museum and offer free admission.\n\nSaskatchewan MP and Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale already has promised to upgrade the heritage centre to a national museum.\n\nA Conservative government also would designate the gravesites of former prime ministers and Governors General as national historic sites, said Scheer.\n\n\"Because I believe Canada's history should always be celebrated. Is it perfect? Of course not. But we must never allow political correctness to erase what made us who we are,\" he said.\n\n\"We should celebrate the giants of our history, like Macdonald, Mackenzie-King and Laurier.\"\n\nLearning from past mistakes\n\nScheer said the nation's museums and memorial installations help Canadians examine their country's past, acknowledge and learn from its mistakes and celebrate its achievements.\n\n\"If we look back on our history and our leaders and see only the blemishes, we miss out on a beautiful story of a country that has progressed into one of the safest, freest and most prosperous in the world,\" he said.\n\nOver the last few years, statues and other memorials dedicated to controversial figures from Canadian history have been subjected to greater scrutiny \u2014 and even removal \u2014 due to greater awareness of the roles they played in causing harm to First Nations, Metis and Inuit.\n\nTwo years ago, the Liberal government led by Justin Trudeau renamed Langevin Block, a building that sits across from Parliament Hill, out of respect for Indigenous Peoples. Hector-Louis Langevin was a father of Confederation and an architect of the residential school system.\n\nThe building is now called the Office of the Prime Minister and the Privy Council.\n\nReconciliation gestures\n\nIn January 2018, the City of Halifax took down a statue of Edward Cornwallis, who founded the city in 1749. The removal was considered an act of reconciliation acknowledging the proclamation Cornwallis made offering a bounty to anyone who killed a Mi'kmaq person.\n\nAlso in 2018, a statue of Macdonald was removed from the steps in front of Victoria City Hall as a reconciliation gesture over Macdonald's part in creating and defending the residential school system in Canada.\n\nMonuments and memorials to Confederate heroes also have been removed in the United States, partly driven by the belief that they glorify white supremacy.\n\nThe Liberals are offering a $200 \"culture pass\" to every child turning 12 to cover the cost of theatres, museums, art galleries and other cultural venues.", "description": "The Conservatives are promising to give Canadians free admission to the country's national museums if they form government this election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5311436.1570447676!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-conservatives-20191005.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
