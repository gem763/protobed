Posted by Triple M Newcastle on Sunday, 27 October 2019\n\n\u201cAnything involving electricity, they will not touch,\u201d Mr Bath told Triple M Newcastle this morning.\n\n\u201cSo any time that we need \u2014 and we do a whole heap of work where we want Ausgrid to come in and actually turn something off essentially, like a telegraph pole so it can be relocated \u2014 Ausgrid say \u2018Sorry, we can\u2019t do it at the moment\u2019.\n\n\u201cSo our choices are we either do no work or we have to stage work such as what you\u2019re seeing in Foundry St.\u201d\n\nI'm reporting on @RNBreakfast from Newcastle today, where the top story is the local council moved the kerb at an intersection in Wickham before @ausgrid shifted the power pole - and let me tell you folks this story is lighting up @CoxDan and @jen_marchant's switchboard. pic.twitter.com/DymlytvHah \u2014 Matt Bevan \ud83c\udf99 (@MatthewBevan) October 27, 2019\n\nMr Bath said it was \u201cincredibly frustrating\u201d and the council would be asking Ausgrid to \u201ctemporarily overlook\u201d the ban on live works to relocate the pole.\n\nThe council boss was quizzed over the sudden appearance of the barricades that are missing in some photographs taken of the scene.\n\nHe said they were always there but locals called the council over the weekend to say they had disappeared.\n\n\u201cWe went out there and put the barricades back,\u201d he told the radio station on Monday.\n\nAusgrid and the council have been contacted by news.com.au for comment.\n\nThe ban on \u201clive works\u201d was put into place after Robert Nicholls, 39, was rushed to Sydney\u2019s Royal North Shore Hospital in a critical condition in April where he later died, according to the Electrical Trades Union.\n\nHe had been part of an Ausgrid crew replacing a low-voltage power pole in Lane Cove when he was electrocuted.\n\nAccording to an update provided by Ausgrid in September, the process to assess the recommencement of live work was ongoing.\n\nA number of tasks were expected to resume including maintenance and replacement of street lighting assets, connection and disconnection of service connectors, and work on or near extra low-voltage exposed conductors.", "description": "Pole position is usually sought after \u2014 but not on this inner Newcastle street.", "authors": ["Sarah Mcphee"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/683c5d9be7e8ed20eddeb6f8547f52fa?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
