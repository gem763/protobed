This is a children's park! Stop!'\n\nShe tries to push one of girls off the swing, before the group insists they are still young enough to be playing on the equipment.\n\n'No, you're f**king not!' Eley shouts back.\n\n'You're not a f**king child \u2013 13 or younger!' she continues.\n\nEley then claims she's a police officer, before she demands: 'Get the f**k out of here now if you're not here to play as a child. Read the f**king sign!'\n\nThe verbal attack doesn't appear to be racially motivated, as the woman was later filmed harassing parents in a separate section of Dream Park.\n\nIn the second video, Eley appears to push in front of other parents in order to have her child use the play equipment.\n\nOne of the teens captured the encounter and posted the video to Twitter, where it went viral\n\n'A sign over there says you can't be over the age of six, is your daughter over the age of six?' she aggressively yells at another mother who takes issue with the fact she has cut the line.\n\n'She's seven,' the woman replies.\n\n'So... she's over the age of six!' Eley snaps back, before she sensationally declares that she 'owns' the park.\n\nHowever, she is soon left red-faced when other parents inform her that the sign says the play equipment is for children aged between five and 12.\n\n'So you built the park, you own it, and you don't know the age range?' one parent then sarcastically asks.\n\n'Yeah... um, maybe I don't. Maybe I need to be more advice,' she stammers nonsensically before wandering off.\n\nDream Park is an 'inclusive park that accommodates children of all ages regardless of physical or mental challenges' and was completed with '$3.1million of privately raised funds'\n\nContrary to Eley's claims, Dream Park is an 'inclusive park that accommodates children of all ages regardless of physical or mental challenges' and was completed with '$3.1million of privately raised funds', The Star Telegram reports.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dallas Forth Worth Police Department later released a statement refuting Eley's claim that she was an officer.", "description": "Samantha Eley, 38, of Fort Worth, was charged on Wednesday with one count of impersonating a public servant following an incident at an all-ages park near Trinity River.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber", "Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/14/20180986-0-image-a-4_1572009997384.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
