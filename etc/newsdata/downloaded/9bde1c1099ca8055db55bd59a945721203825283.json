He went viral in February for a \u201cPatriot Act\u201d segment that laid out the confusion many parents and students face in navigating student loan repayment plans. He said that student debt was one of the most requested topics that fans of his show want to see covered.\n\nRelated: Comedian Hasan Minhaj on student debt: \u2018This system has become broken\u2019\n\nIn fact, when Minhaj polled his live studio audience of about 200 people during that February show, he found their collective student loan debt was more than $6 million \u2014 more expensive than the \u201cPatriot Act\u201d set.\n\n\u201cNow granted, our audience is mainly unemployed poli-sci majors, but that\u2019s still a lot of money,\u201d he told the congressional committee on Tuesday.\n\nHe also pointed out that the committee had graduated from college about 33 years ago and paid an inflation-adjusted tuition of $11,690 a year on average. Yet currently, tuition at those same schools is almost $25,000 \u2014 a 110% increase on today\u2019s students, while wages have only increased 16% during those three decades.\n\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t making more money, and college is objectively way more expensive,\u201d said Minhaj. \u201cAnd yet many borrowers are still treated like deadbeats because the government has put their financial futures in the hands of predatory for-profit loan servicing companies.\u201d\n\n\u2018Many borrowers are still treated like deadbeats because the government has put their financial futures in the hands of predatory for-profit loan servicing companies.\u2019 Hasan Minhaj\n\nPresidential candidates including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have both proposed clearing some or all of the nation\u2019s student loan debt as a platform in their campaigns. Researchers have also suggested that canceling some or all of the nation\u2019s outstanding student debt could potentially boost the nation\u2019s gross domestic product and shrink the racial wealth gap.\n\nRelated: How wiping out $1.5 trillion in student debt would boost the economy\n\nMinhaj closed by asking Congress why it doesn\u2019t treat student borrowers the way it treats U.S. banks. \u201cBecause 44 million Americans, that is too big to fail,\u201d he said.", "description": "The Netflix \u201cPatriot Act\u201d host has been vocal about the $1.6 trillion debt crisis.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR068_HasanM_ZG_20190911092604.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
