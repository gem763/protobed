They work by taking a URL a user is trying to access and checking it against a database of known bad sites.\n\nFor years, Apple has used Google's Safe Browsing API inside Safari to check for bad links. Starting earlier this year, Apple also added Tencent's safe browsing system to Apple as well.\n\nBut this update has been misinterpreted by several news outlets over the weekend under scary headlines of \"Apple sends users' web browsing history to China,\" amid a recent rise in Chinese anti-sentiment and fearmongering triggered by the recent Hong Kong protests and the US-Sino trade war.\n\nHowever, the reality is that this is not how modern safe browsing mechanisms work.\n\nIt's true that early versions of safe browsing mechanisms did rely on sending a URL over the internet to a \"safe browsing provider\" where the link was checked against a remote database of malicious sites.\n\nBut, nowadays, most safe browsing mechanisms, such as those managed by Google and Tencent, work by sending a copy of the database to a user's browser and letting the browser check the URL against this local database.\n\nAccording to Apple, this is also how Apple developers have implemented Safari's safe browsing mechanism -- to never send the user's internet browsing traffic to safe browsing providers.\n\nTencent's safe browsing used only for devices with Chinese locale\n\n\n\nFurthermore, as several developers have also pointed out over the weekend, Tencent is not the default safe browsing provider. Tencent is only used on devices where the Chinese locale is enabled [1, 2, 3].\n\nThe reasoning behind supporting Tencent is quite simple -- the Chinese government bans Google domains inside China; hence, Safari users in China wouldn't be able to receive Google's database of malicious links and subsequent updates.\n\nApple added support for Tencent as an alternative safe browsing provider specifically for Chinese users. It did so in order to keep its Chinese userbase safe, similar to everyone else, and show alerts whenever one of them might end up wandering off and landing on a bad site.\n\nBelow is Apple's full statement:", "description": "Apple explains how Safari's recent Safe Browsing update works -- following a slew of misleading media reports.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/08/12/d5708236-8400-4426-bd25-7071ecac6f85/thumbnail/770x578/c45410abee6523c4438b7f2c7088f8d1/10-safari-browser-geralt-zdnet-eileen-brown.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
