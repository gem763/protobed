After being a zombie fund since June, staggering onward but without any investor money able to flow in or out, time has been called on Woodford Equity Income.\n\nIt never seemed likely this story would have a happy ending but the news it will be wound up in January still arrived with a jolt this morning.\n\nIn a way it could be seen as act of mercy by administrator Link. It puts an end to some of the uncertainty that investors have been living with since June and gives them a timeframe when they will get some money back, at least.\n\nIt also relieves the man himself from being what looked a lot like somebody engaged in a hopeless task akin to holding back the tides of the sea.\n\nFallen fund manager Neil Woodford pictured outside his Oxfordshire office\n\nWoodford had been making a limited amount of progress in selling down his positions to raise the cash needed to meet the inevitable rush of demands for money if his fund reopened.\n\nThe reality is that it was nowhere near enough. Certainly not to meet the December target he had rather optimistically been set.\n\nEverybody Woodford will have been trying to sell shares to will have known he was desperate. Not a good basis to do deals.\n\nMany may have concluded that if they simply waited, they could buy at a cheaper price when the fund was eventually liquidated. He also hasn't been helped by further unfavourable movements in the share prices of some of the companies that he has bought for investors.\n\nThe most obvious victims in this sorry tale are the people who have money trapped in the doomed fund. They will all face financial losses, the degree of which is yet to be determined.\n\nWithin this group there is also an important distinction to be made between those who can afford the loss and those who really can't.\n\nFirstly, there will be those wealthy enough to lose money through Woodford's fund - or have investments that are a small part of their portfolios - and see no real effect on their lives. The rest of their money held in bank accounts and across various other investment vehicles will be more than enough to buy them anything they may need.\n\nThere are plenty of Woodford's investors though who will have been counting on the money they have in the fund to pay for something important and have few other investments.\n\nTheir retirement plans may be dependent on the money. Perhaps it is needed for a deposit on a house or a wedding. Even the new car they have set their heart on.\n\nThese people are where our deepest sympathies should lie and their plight should motivate the City, its regulators and the media to do whatever can be done to stop a similar catastrophe occurring with another big fund.\n\nThe only good thing to jump out from this episode is that British investors have had the most powerful of lessons in the need to diversify their assets and it seems far fewer will ever throw all or most of their money behind one person again, regardless of how well he has done in the past.\n\nWoodford in better times - A publicity shot issued shortly before the launch of his firm in 2014\n\nThis brings me to the far bigger group that could potentially be hit by what has happened with Woodford. The entire British population, and maybe some in other nations too.\n\nIf rather than seeing what happened as a lesson in the need for diversification, a large number of people take it as a reason to avoid investing all together that would be a far wider and longer lasting loss than the money lost specifically in Woodford Equity Income.\n\nSensibly investing in shares through a wide range of funds held for five years or more, whether through active or passive options, is perhaps the surest way to meet financial goals and build wealth.\n\nTurning a significant proportion of the public off investing for their future through the stock market entirely would be a terrible legacy for Britain's most famous fund manager.\n\nThere is a real risk of this, given how high profile Woodford is and how hard and costly the fall has been.\n\nEverybody should do what they can to make sure this doesn't happen and the public's trust in the investment industry is rebuilt. Not for the sake of Woodford or the City, but for society as a whole.", "description": "It never seemed likely the Woodford story would have a happy ending but the news it will be wound up in January still arrived with a jolt this morning.", "authors": ["Alex Sebastian For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
