(AP) - A Yellowstone National Park visitor has been hospitalized with severe burns and could face charges after falling into a thermal pool at Old Faithful Geyser, park officials said Monday.\n\nCade Edmond Siemers, 48, told rangers he was walking near the famous geyser late Sunday night without a flashlight when he tripped into a hot spring, park spokeswoman Morgan Warthin said. He was able to get back to his hotel to call for help, and Warthin said rangers who interviewed him suspected he\u2019d been drinking alcohol.\n\nRangers later found Siemers\u2019 shoe, a hat and a beer can near the geyser. They also found footprints going to and from the scene and blood on a nearby boardwalk.\n\nSiemers, a U.S. citizen who had been living in India, was taken by ambulance to West Yellowstone and airlifted to a burn center at the Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center in Idaho Falls for treatment.\n\nHe was in critical condition on Monday and unavailable for comment, hospital spokeswoman Coleen Niemann said.\n\nThe temperature of the water at the pool where Siemers was injured measured almost 150 degrees Fahrenheit (66 Celsius) when it was tested in August, Warthin said.\n\nIt is illegal to leave the boardwalks around Old Faithful, punishable by up to six months in prison and a $5,000 fine. The results of an investigation into the accident will be forwarded to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for a decision on whether criminal charges will be filed.\n\nSo far in 2019, about three dozen people have been cited by rangers for walking away from boardwalks in thermal areas. That\u2019s an increase from the number of citations in 2018, Warthin said.\n\nIn 2016, a 23-year-old Oregon man died after falling into a Yellowstone hot spring.\n\nSome Yellowstone thermal areas can reach 199 degrees Fahrenheit (93 Celsius), the boiling point for water at the park\u2019s high elevation.\n\nAt least 22 people are known to have died from hot spring-related injuries in and around Yellowstone since 1890, park officials have said. Most of the deaths have been accidents, although at least two people had been trying to swim in a hot spring.\n\nWalking off boardwalks also can damage thermal areas.\n\nThe thin crust that makes up the ground in parts of Yellowstone is formed when minerals underground are dissolved by the high-temperature water, then redeposited on or near the surface.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Yellowstone National Park visitor has been hospitalized with severe burns and could face charges after falling into a thermal pool at Old Faithful Geyser, park officials said Monday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Matthew Brown"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
