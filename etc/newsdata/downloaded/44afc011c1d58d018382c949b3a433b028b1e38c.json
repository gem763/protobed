It is great to feel loved by the fans.\n\n\u201cWhilst the song is not offensive to me, it would be great to hear a new family version of the song so all of the young supporters in the stadium can join in too.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com 'I don't feel there's any racism in it': Football ace Raheem Sterling defends teammate Bernardo Silva's controversial tweet\n\nToney arrived at the club from Newcastle United last year and has found his scoring form this season. The hitman has netted 11 goals in 17 games for Peterborough United so far as he has helped fire The Posh to third in the League 1 table.\n\nHis goals have also made Peterborough the highest-scoring team in the division, with 36 goals scored in their 15 league games played to date.\n\nNow Toney hopes the fans will respect his wishes and tone down their chants for him to help include the club's younger fans.\n\nThe chant is similar to one Manchester United fans sang for Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku back in 2017. At the time, the anti-discrimination group Kick It Out contacted the club telling United the chant's words were \u201coffensive and discriminatory\u201d.\n\n\u201cRacist stereotypes are never acceptable, irrespective of any intention to show support for a player,\u201d said the organization.", "description": "English League 1 striker Ivan Toney has asked his team's fans to tone down a chant referring to the size of his penis, saying he'd love them to chant something even kids can join in with during matches.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5db979712030273c3538fc16.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
