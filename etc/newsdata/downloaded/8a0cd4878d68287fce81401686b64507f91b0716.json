Its AirPods, released in 2016, currently dominate the category with a 53% share of the 27 million \u201chearables\" sold globally from April-June this year, according to data gathered by Counterpoint Research.\n\n\"Apple will keep leading the market for the time being thanks to its loyal base of hardware users and its sticky ecosystem of devices and software,\u201d said Counterpoint Research senior analyst Liz Lee.\n\n\"It will also release new ear buds with a major overhaul to the design expected in late 2020 and refresh the market again. We expect that Apple\u2019s share will be around 40%-50% this year and a bit lower next year, but still, it will be the biggest player.\"\n\nWhile AirPods appear to be simply a wireless version of the headphones Apple has sold for a decade now, the firm considers them to be something far more strategic: its best opportunity to get consumers interacting with devices using voice.\n\nThey do little to address Apple\u2019s main problem right now, which is that once people get home, they\u2019re more likely - if they have a smart speaker - to talk to an assistant from Amazon or Google than they are to Siri.\n\nAmazon\u2019s problem is the other way round. The success of its Alexa assistant has it leading the smart-speaker market in our homes, according to Canalys research, but the firm\u2019s disastrous attempt to break into smartphones means Alexa has mostly been stuck indoors.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Apple's AirPods are the beachhead in a fight for the attention of consumers\n\nOn Wednesday, Amazon took significant steps it hopes will change that with the announcement of Echo Buds, wireless ear buds with Alexa built in - the most straightforward way yet to take Alexa out of the home. The device is cheaper than AirPods - $129 v $199 - and has the added selling point of including noise cancellation, something AirPods lack.\n\n\"It is apparent that access to Alexa could be more appealing for some people than access to Siri, as Alexa can be used to order goods from Amazon directly and Amazon's ecosystem is more open than Apple\u2019s,\u201d said Ms Lee.\n\n\"Amazon could also take aggressive markdowns including offering its new gadget in Prime deals and bundles for cheap during the Black Friday sales to increase market share.\u201d\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Amazon is keen to get its Alexa technology into lots of different devices\n\nMore in-ear players will soon emerge. Next week, Microsoft is expected to announce its own smart wireless ear buds too. And Google, with its own assistant and a range of voice-powered software (such as auto language translation), could offer another strong device, improving on the Pixel Buds that were launched in 2017. The company is holding its hardware launch event on 11 October.\n\nThe eyes have it\n\nAmazon is also hoping to turn heads - though not too quickly - with Echo Frames. These are glasses with Alexa relatively discreetly built into the titanium frames. Paired to a smartphone, they vibrate when a notification is received and, like the Echo Pods, allow for voice commands to be given to Alexa via two microphones.\n\nIt\u2019s being seen as a modest first step en route to the real goal: smart glasses containing augmented reality (AR), digitally created imagery laid over the real world.\n\nJust as Amazon was talking about Echo Frames at its HQ in Seattle, Facebook was busy sharing its own aspirations for AR at its Oculus Connect developers\u2019 conference in San Jose.\n\nAndrew Bosworth, Facebook\u2019s head of virtual reality and AR, said the firm was building AR glasses. A demonstration video showed how pop-ups could appear in your vision, alerting you to movie times or directions. This product isn\u2019t imminent - Facebook has a lot of work to do to make the tech a reality.\n\nAnd the firm is currently lacking a full-featured voice assistant of its own (though it has been working on one as part of its Portal video chat range).\n\nThere are credible rumours that Apple is preparing to release its own AR wearable device too. According to Wired, those who keep a close eye on the code contained in Apple\u2019s operating system, iOS, noticed that deep inside recent updates was code that looked almost certain to be related to some kind of future AR device.\n\nTaiwanese analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has predicted an Apple AR device could be ready as early as the middle of next year.\n\nLooking foolish\n\nGetting these devices to work well is just one hurdle to overcome, however. There are also the issues of style and trust.\n\nYou\u2019ll remember Google Glass, released in 2013, that as well as suffering from technological shortcomings was also held back by the fact it made the wearer look rather foolish (no offence, Rory).\n\nNewer technologies are bulky and cumbersome. Microsoft\u2019s Hololens and Magic Leap\u2019s goggles sit heavy on either the head or hip.\n\nAnd these technologies make other people uncomfortable. Famously, one woman was attacked for wearing Google Glass in a San Francisco bar.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Google Glass was not a good look\n\nAR glasses will need to use outward-facing cameras to detect objects around them, and it is likely that tech firms will consider video recording, and calling, to be a selling point. Ear buds, similarly, will need to capture some amount of audio from the world around them in order to work.\n\nThe wearer might be fine with that, yes, but what of those around them who may not want to be captured and analysed by companies that have already lost our confidence?\n\nThat\u2019s what makes this latest tech race different. Anyone buying these devices will spend time considering not just which company has the best technology, but also the best intentions.\n\n_____\n\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\n\nDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?
