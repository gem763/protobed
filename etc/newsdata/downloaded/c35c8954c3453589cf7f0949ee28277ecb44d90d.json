Click here to find out how.\n\n\n\nFriday looks GOOD! Breezes near the top-end of criteria but we'll take it.\n\nToday (Friday): Refreshing! Riding on some gusty north breezes, perhaps near 25 mph, the air becomes comfortably dry (dew points in the 40s) by day\u2019s end. Any early clouds should clear, with sun dominating. Enjoy low to mid-70s, beautifully average temperatures for this time of year \u2014 revel in October! Confidence: High\n\nTonight: With high pressure settling in, breezes (slowly) calm and skies remain clear. Without any atmospheric insulation by clouds or stirring around by much wind, heat escapes from the ground quickly. Low temperatures around 50 degrees are possible downtown. The rest of the region, outside of the Beltway, bottoms out around dawn in the 40s. Confidence: High\n\nFollow us on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for the latest updates.

Keep reading for the forecast into next week...\n\n\n\nSaturday has lower breezes and temperatures near low-end of our Nice Day range, but still GOOD!\n\nTomorrow (Saturday): Wonderfully fall-like and, whoa, below-average temperatures in the mid- to upper 60s. It may be a slightest of shocks to our bodies having come from 98 degrees on Wednesday. Easterly breezes remain light to moderate, with clouds only slowly increasing near sunset. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTomorrow night: Some of the calmest winds of this forecast, perhaps, with only the slightest of breezes. Clouds continue to slowly increase. A raindrop or two can\u2019t be ruled out, nearer dawn. We only bottom out around 60 degrees downtown while mid- to upper 50s are likely away from the city. Confidence: Medium\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nSunday: Despite some clouds and the chance for a couple of showers, we should still head into the 70s. It may feel slightly humid for this time of year by day\u2019s end, as dew points rise to near 60 degrees. We\u2019ve got a cold front slowly approaching the region from the west, drawing up moderate southerly breezes to warm (and slightly humidify) us. Confidence: Medium\n\nSunday night: A few more hit-or-miss showers mill about the region overnight. Muggier low temperatures for the entire region, only \u201ccooling\u201d off into the 60s. Confidence: Medium\n\nIt remains mild enough but somewhat cloudier with the potential for showers Monday and Tuesday. Stay tuned as we get closer and home in on precipitation and temperature range. It looks like Monday should get into at least the low to mid-70s, with some breeze. Tuesday, perhaps cooler mid-60s to low 70s. We\u2019ll watch whether we see a couple of periods of steadier rain. Slight mugginess and breezes Monday (dew points in the low 60s) should wane, followed by slightly calmer and more comfortable air (dew points around 50 degrees) on Tuesday. Forecast tweaks are likely as we close in. Confidence: Low-Medium", "description": "Fall weather is here. It even feels a little cool by tomorrow.", "authors": ["A.
