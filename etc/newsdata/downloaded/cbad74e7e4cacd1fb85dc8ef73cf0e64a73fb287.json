AMC\u2019s next spinoff of The Walking Dead, which does not yet have a title, picks up a decade after the zombiepocalypse when a walled city of about 9,000 people has formed within the undead chaos. It\u2019s not like a Negan-run dictatorship. It\u2019s a seemingly functional society that\u2019s trying to approximate life before the fall, and a handful of our primary heroes are kids (a generation dubbed Endlings) who, for some reason, want to go beyond the gates and explore the great unknown. \u201cI came out here to see what the world is, start to finish,\u201d a boy in a pretentious suit says. \u201cI don\u2019t intend to finish before I start.\u201d That\u2019s cute and all, kiddo, but didn\u2019t anyone tell you the world is still filled with flesh-eating monsters? You\u2019re not even dressed to fight the zombies! What were you going to do? Invite them to a posh lunch so you can talk through your problems? Anyway, Nico Tortorella also stars in this new Dead world where some will \u201cbecome heroes\u201d while others \u201cbecome villains,\u201d but \u201cin the end, all of them will be changed forever.\u201d And some will surely be changed into zombies! Look for it in spring of next year.\n\nRelated", "description": "Watch the trailer for the next spinoff series in The Walking Dead universe, which does not have a title yet, but it does have plenty of dead that are walking.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/07/07-the-walking-dead-universe.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
