Photo: Cengiz Yar/Getty Images\n\nHe might be at the center of an impeachment inquiry in Washington, D.C., but that\u2019s not stopping President Trump from waging a petty dispute 1,100 miles away. His target is Jacob Frey, the 37-year-old mayor of Minneapolis, whom Trump and his campaign are accusing of extortion related to a \u201cKeep America Great\u201d rally scheduled for Thursday.\n\nTrump\u2019s complaints start with the cost of the rally. City officials have attempted to pass the bill for Trump\u2019s visit \u2014 which they say will total $530,000 \u2014 on to the Target Center, the downtown arena where the rally is to be held. AEG Management, which owns the arena, tried to secure payment from the Trump campaign, saying the event could not be held unless the bill was paid up front. The campaign called this extortion, claiming a refusal to allow the rally to go ahead would be breach of contract. In a letter to AEG Management, the Trump campaign\u2019s legal team said it \u201cwill aggressively pursue all remedies available to it in law or equity.\u201d\n\nIn need of someone to blame, Trump and his campaign have chosen Frey, who said last month that he couldn\u2019t keep Trump from coming to town but assured locals that the president\u2019s \u201cmessage of hatred will never be welcome in Minneapolis.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet Monday, Trump\u2019s campaign manager Brad Parscale wrote: \u201cThe radical Mayor of Minneapolis, @Jacob_Frey, is abusing his power in an attempt to block the President\u2019s supporters from seeing him speak on Thursday.\u201d Trump retweeted Parscale Tuesday and added a well-worn insult, calling Frey a \u201clightweight.\u201d Frey replied:\n\nYawn... Welcome to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors. https://t.co/v1cXvoD9uR \u2014 Jacob Frey (@Jacob_Frey) October 8, 2019\n\nThe rally has also caused internal controversy in Minneapolis, where there\u2019s a new policy forbidding local police from wearing uniforms to political functions while off duty. The head of the local police union said he was told of the policy change the day after Trump\u2019s rally was announced, but the police department said the policy had been under consideration for months.\n\nUnable to wear their uniforms to the rally, many members of the Minneapolis police will instead wear custom shirts that say \u201cCops for Trump.\u201d Union head Bob Kroll went on Fox News last week to promote the shirts and explain his problem with the new policy. \u201cMy members are outraged,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of them want to be there; they want to be in the backdrop, have an opportunity to meet him. He\u2019s shown that he\u2019s a very pro-law-enforcement president.\u201d\n\nTrump gave Kroll a shout-out Tuesday, tweeting, \u201cThank you to Lt. Bob Kroll of the great Minneapolis Police Department for your kind words on @foxandfriends. The Police are fighting the Radical Left Mayor, and his ridiculous Uniform Ban. Actually, I LOVE the Cops for Trump shirts. Want to bring some home. I am with you 100%!!!!\u201d\n\nTrump has previously clashed with local governments over the cost of hosting his mega MAGA rallies. As of June, Trump still owed at least ten cities hundreds of thousands of dollars for rallies held since early 2016, according to the Center for Public Integrity. The biggest outstanding bill is from El Paso, Texas, where Trump held a rally in February to whip up fear of migrants. As of last week, the campaign still owed El Paso $560,000 after the city \u201cprovided security, some aviation assistance and busing,\u201d the El Paso Times reports. Also last week, the Trump campaign and the RNC reported raising $125 million in the third quarter of 2019.", "description": "After a Minneapolis arena tried to pass a half-million-dollar security bill for a MAGA rally on to the campaign, Team Trump threatened to sue and attacked Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis.", "authors": ["Adam K.
