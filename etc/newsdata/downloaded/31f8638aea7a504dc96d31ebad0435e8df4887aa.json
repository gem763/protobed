It\u2019ll premiere on November 4th on HBO and a day earlier (on November 3rd) on BBC One in the UK.\n\nThere\u2019s not a new trailer to accompany the release date announcement, but the date does mean that fans will only have to wait a few short weeks before jumping back into the world of Lyra Belacqua (played by Logan star Dafne Keen). His Dark Materials is set in an alternate world where parts of people\u2019s souls manifest as external animals called daemons. Lyra faces off against the Church, a powerful religious group that looks to understand the nature of the universe. (Things escalate considerably from there.)\n\nUnlike Game of Thrones, His Dark Materials isn\u2019t being directly produced by the network. Instead, it\u2019s a co-production between the BBC and HBO along with New Line Cinema; HBO is handling the distribution for the show outside of the UK.\n\nStill, the series is likely to be a big deal for the premium cable service, which is looking to fill a notably Thrones-shaped hole in its lineup going forward. While Pullman\u2019s series may skew a little more family-friendly than Game of Thrones, the epic, worlds-spanning scope of the story could help draw in fans of HBO\u2019s premiere dragon series. HBO and the BBC are certainly betting big on it: the second season has already begun production.\n\nThe TV series won\u2019t be the first attempt to adapt Pullman\u2019s fantasy trilogy. An ill-fated film adaptation called The Golden Compass was released in 2007, but it wasn\u2019t successful, and any plans for sequels were canned. Pullman has recently returned to the world of the series with a new trilogy called The Book of Dust. The second book in that trilogy, The Secret Commonwealth, is set to arrive on October 3rd.", "description": "After months of teasers and trailers, HBO has finally announced a release date for its upcoming His Dark Materials TV series, which is adapted from the popular fantasy book series by Philip Pullman.
