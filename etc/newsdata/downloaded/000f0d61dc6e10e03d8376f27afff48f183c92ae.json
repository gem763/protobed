Meteors burning up through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is what gives the impression of shooting stars.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHow impressive the spectacle is depends on a variety of factors, including how close Earth passes inside the comet\u2019s orbit.\n\nThe most spectacular October Draconids took place in 1933 and 1946, when thousands of meteors were visible each hour.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
