Soon after, they began planning how they would start a family together.\n\nCourtesy George Arison\n\nThe couple knew they wanted their children to be related to each other and were hopeful they could each have a genetic link to the children also. As two gay men, they saw the reality that it would be a winding road to parenthood, adoption included, and decided to look into surrogacy.\n\nArison and Luo also knew they would need a woman to help them, which turned into three women.\n\nThey chose their egg donor -- a woman who will remain anonymous until much later if both the woman and Luka and Emilia want to meet -- and fertilized one egg with Arison's sperm and one with Luo's sperm.\n\nThey then settled in for the search for two surrogates, which proved to be a months-long process. Arison and Luo needed two surrogates because their fertility clinic would only implant one embryo in a surrogate at a time, a standard practice to reduce the risk of complications.\n\nThe couple also wanted to ideally find surrogates close to their lives in San Francisco so they could maintain close ties during the pregnancies.\n\nThey ended up finding, with the help of an agency, two women willing to carry their babies who lived in California but more than 300 miles apart.\n\nCourtesy George Arison\n\nLate last year, the two women met each other and Luo and Arison for the first time when they came together in San Francisco for the embryo transfers.\n\n\"They don't know this but, from the lab, when they came in, we were able to see [Luo and Arison] giving gifts to [the] women and hugging [the] women,\" said Dr. Peter Klatsky, the couple's fertility doctor and director of fertility preservation at Spring Fertility. \"It was a really meaningful and special day for all involved.\"\n\nIn what Arison described as an \"unexpected\" but very welcome outcome, the embryo transfers in each women were successful that day. Luo and Arison spent the next nine months looking after their two pregnancies.\n\n\"Robert attended nearly every ultrasound the surrogates had,\" said Arison, whose company, Shift, is a startup. \"I joke that I started a company and Robert started another company, our children.\"\n\nThe couple also recorded themselves reading children's books throughout the pregnancies and sent the recordings to each surrogate to play for their children. Arison recorded some of the books in his native Georgian language.\n\nCourtesy George Arison\n\nOne of the books they read aloud, \"And Tango Makes Three,\" is one they plan to keep reading to their kids as they grow. The book tells the true story of two penguins at the Central Park Zoo who create a nontraditional family with the help of others.\n\n\"We're going to tell [Luka and Emilia] there were very nice women who were willing to carry [you] in her tummy,\" Arison said. \"We\u2019ll never be able to say enough thank yous to our surrogates.\"\n\nThe surrogate carrying Luka went into labor earlier this month. On Sept. 2 she gave birth to him, a healthy 9 pounds, 4 ounces boy.\n\nLuo and Arison were there for the delivery and as they celebrated the birth of their first child, got word the surrogate carrying Emilia was having contractions.\n\nThey rushed to her hometown and after a few days of agonizing waiting -- leaving Luka behind with his surrogate -- Emilia was born on Sept. 11, weighing 7 pounds, 11 ounces.\n\nLuo was even able to scrub in and help with the delivery of Emilia, according to Arison.\n\nCourtesy George Arison\n\n\"I cried when the embryos were transferred and I cried when Luka was [born] and I cried when Robert helped deliver Emilia,\" he said. \"It was incredible.\"\n\nThe new dads are now home with both babies in San Francisco, relishing in the fact that their dreams of becoming parents came true.\n\nArison said he does not take for granted the fact that he and Luo live in California, a state where surrogacy is legal and where the two dads had their names placed on their kids' birth certificates immediately without a legal fight.\n\n\"The fact that we can do this makes me feel really good about the world we live in,\" Arison said. \"We are massively relieved and grateful.\"", "description": "George Arison and Robert Luo's journey to parenthood ended with two babies.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/dads-3-ht-er-190918_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
