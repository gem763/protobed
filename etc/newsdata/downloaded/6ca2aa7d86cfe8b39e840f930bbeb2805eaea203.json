The information she provides to lawmakers is likely to be key to House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into whether the President abused the power of his office to compel Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election. Her testimony comes as new details reveal how Trump\u2019s allies inside and outside the administration pushed for her ouster in May, amid efforts by Trump allies to persuade the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. The career diplomat with three decades of experience was recalled from her post in Kiev two months early. Having seen this year\u2019s events in Ukraine up close, Democrats hope she can provide Congress with new information about the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to pressure officials there to open several investigations that Trump critics allege were politically motivated.\n\nYovanovitch was expected to tell congressional investigators that she was alarmed by Rudy Giuliani\u2019s activities in Ukraine because Trump\u2019s personal lawyer \u201croutinely bypassed\u201d all the normal policy procedures, including the National Security Council and the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, one person familiar with her thinking said Thursday evening.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Mike Quigley.\n\nAccording to a federal indictment made public on Thursday, two associates of Giuliani\u2019s pressed a sitting U.S. congressman to ask for Yovanovitch\u2019s removal last year. A review of campaign finance filings and his own public statements identify that Congressman as former Texas representative Pete Sessions.\n\nOn May 9, 2018, Sessions sent a private letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in which he cited \u201cconcrete evidence from close companions that Ambassador Yovanovitch has spoken privately and repeatedly about her disdain for the current administration.\u201d Sessions\u2019 letter has since been made public.\n\nIn a deleted Facebook post also from May 9, 2018, Lev Parnas, one of the two businessmen charged with campaign finance violations on Thursday, posted two photos of himself with Sessions on Capitol Hill with the caption \u201cHard at work!!\u201d\n\nSessions is not charged with any wrongdoing, and was not named in the indictment.\n\nParnas and his business partner, Igor Fruman, had \u201ccommitted to raise $20,000 or more for a then-sitting U.S. Congressman,\u201d the indictment says.\n\nSessions campaign finance disclosures show that he received $2,700 contributions from both Parnas and Fruman in 2018, as well as just over $3 million from the pro-Trump Super PAC America First Action, to which the two businessmen contributed $325,000 in the name of a company they had set up.\n\nSessions has not disputed that he is \u201cCongressman-1.\u201d On Thursday, he denied that these meetings were connected to his letter to Pompeo, which he said came \u201cafter several congressional colleagues reported to me that the current US Ambassador to Ukraine was disparaging President Trump to others as part of those official duties.\u201d\n\nLast week, Sessions acknowledged meeting with the two businessmen. \u201cThis was during the campaign, early in the campaign, and they did come by my office and I did meet them and I did meet them off the Hill and they did become contributors,\u201d Sessions said in a local television interview on Oct. 4, before Parnas and Fruman were arrested. \u201cThat is not unusual for you to meet people who then become contributors.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch allies say the allegations in the indictment nonetheless provide evidence of how inappropriate political pressure led to her dismissal. The Trump administration found her \u201cinsufficiently loyal to the President and not committed to carrying out his foreign policy,\u201d a U.S. official familiar with her dismissal previously told TIME.\n\nYovanovitch told lawmakers that she was abruptly told to come back to Washington \u201con the next plane\u201d in April this year, where the Deputy Secretary of State informed her that she would have to leave her post two months early due to \u201ca concerted campaign\u201d against her. \u201cThe Department had been under pressure from the President to remove me since the Summer of 2018,\u201d she said.\n\nTwo months after Yovanovitch\u2019s premature departure, Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that \u201cthe former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news.\u201d Zelensky said he agreed \u201c100%.\u201d\n\nBut within the diplomatic community, many remain outraged at the abrupt dismissal of the veteran diplomat following what they say is a political smear campaign.\n\nYovanivitch, who was sworn in as ambassador to Ukraine in August 2016, had served in ambassadorships under three administrations. \u201cHer early recall raises questions about whether you put the personal interests of the President above the Department\u2019s career personnel or U.S. foreign policy,\u201d ten Democratic Senators wrote in a letter to Pompeo on Thursday, seeking more details about Yovanovitch\u2019s dismissal. Multiple State Department officials have complained to TIME that Pompeo is failing to defend the professionals in the department he leads.\n\nFiona Hill, Trump\u2019s former Russia adviser at the White House who resigned in August, is expected to testify on Monday. A person familiar with her thinking told TIME that Yovanovitch\u2019s ouster had affected Hill. \u201cThat sent a shiver through the whole Foreign Service, which was already shivering about how Trump was treating them and Pompeo wasn\u2019t defending them,\u201d the person said.\n\nYovanovitch\u2019s reputation in the diplomatic corps and with foreign officials with whom she\u2019s dealt in her three-decade career does not square with Trump\u2019s characterization of her as \u201cbad news.\u201d \u201cIf anything, she is no news. She always avoided attention because she thought it interfered with quiet diplomacy,\u201d one U.S. diplomat who worked with her earlier in her career said earlier this week.\n\nAnother U.S. official, who worked for her in Kyiv and discussed a domestic political issue only on the condition of anonymity and without authorization, could \u201cnot recall any occasion on which she spoke ill of this or any other president or politician.\u201d A current Foreign Service Officer who served with her at another post said she made it clear to her subordinates that they owed their loyalty to the United States, not to whomever was president at the time. \u201cI think that\u2019s what got her in trouble,\u201d said this official, who also requested anonymity to discuss a domestic political matter.\n\nYovanovitch did not respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment, and has shunned the news media as the Ukraine scandal has escalated. This fall, she is teaching a course titled \u201cUkraine: Policy Issues\u201d in the Georgetown\u2019s School of Foreign Service.\n\n\u2013with reporting by Simon Shuster/Berlin and Alana Abramson/Washington\n\nWrite to Alana Abramson at Alana.Abramson@time.com.", "description": "America's former ambassador to Ukraine is expected to testify in a closed session on Friday, officials working on the inquiry tell TIME.", "authors": ["Vera Bergengruen", "John Walcott", "Alana Abramson"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/marie-yovanovitch-1.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
