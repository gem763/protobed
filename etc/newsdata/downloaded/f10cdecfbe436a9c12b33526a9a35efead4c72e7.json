They say they can\u2019t galvanize world support for their view unless they can draw a clear link back to Tehran, which has denied any role in the attacks.\n\nThe GPS systems could allow investigators to trace the drones and missiles back to their runways and launchers, which Saudi and American officials believe were in Iran. Inspectors from around the world\u2014including the U.S., France and the United Nations\u2014are scrutinizing pieces of the weapons from the attacks, which temporarily knocked out half of Saudi oil production and rattled the global economy.\n\nThe GPS examination is part of a more expansive investigation that includes efforts to trace serial numbers of the weapons used in the attacks back to their origin. The probe is going forward as Washington and Riyadh weigh a response to the attack.\n\nAn expanded version of this report can be found at WSJ.com:\n\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\n\nUnder AI\u2019s Watchful Eye, China Wants to Raise Smarter Students\n\nAugust\u2019s hot recession trade is cooling", "description": "Officials in Riyadh and Washington have blamed Iran for the attacks on Saudi oil facilities and are searching for \u201csmoking gun\u201d evidence.", "authors": ["Dion Nissenbaum"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR333_aramco_ZG_20190915232025.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
