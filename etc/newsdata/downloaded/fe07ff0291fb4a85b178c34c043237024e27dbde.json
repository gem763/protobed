He signed a nine-year contract extension two years ago which contained a release clause of \u20ac150m.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaul is, according to the Daily Mail, on United\u2019s transfer short list which also contains the likes of James Maddison, the 22-year-old Leicester playmaker who has earned England recognition since his move from Norwich approaching 18 months ago.\n\nIn the short-term, Solskjaer will remain reliant on the likes of Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard to supply the ammunition for the likes of Marcus Rashford and he has urged his more creative players to be braver on the ball ahead of Sunday\u2019s showdown with Liverpool.\n\n\u2018The coaching here is excellent and we are just waiting for that to flourish,\u2019 said Solskjaer.\n\n\u2018You can see loads of it, the defensive part, which is giving us a platform to play from. That last bit is going to come because we have players with that flair.\n\n\u2018Maybe young players want to play safe but you have to take risks at this club, you can\u2019t play safe.\n\n\u2018One of my big philosophies is you attack quickly. You want to win the ball in great positions to attack from, but teams are so quickly back into shape these days you lose that moment of transition in one or two less positive passes.\u2019\n\nMORE: Juventus set price for Manchester United to sign former Liverpool star Emre Can\n\nMORE: Manchester United star Paul Pogba posts fresh injury update after Liverpool blow", "description": "Manchester United are monitoring Atletico Madrid midfielder Saul Niguez ahead of an intended \u00a3300million summer rebuild.
