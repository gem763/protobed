GM, -0.35% For the next 15 years, UAW strikes were relatively common and extremely successful, culminating in the Treaty of Detroit in 1950, which shaped management-labor relations for decades. Even today, worker strikes in most industries are still generally considered an effective tactic.\n\nSo when UAW on Sept. 15 began its first nationwide strike against GM in more than a decade \u2014 for, among other things, higher wages and an end to its two-tiered salary system \u2014 you might think workers stood a reasonable chance to win the concessions they sought.\n\nMy research into the history of the U.S. auto industry, however, suggests that the strike is likely doomed to fail.\n\nWhy past strikes succeeded\n\nIn \u201cWrecked: How the American Automobile Industry Destroyed Its Capacity to Compete,\u201d sociologist Michael Schwartz and I looked at the history of labor relations and production systems in the U.S. and Japanese auto industry to better understand the decline of the \u201cBig Three\u201d auto makers \u2014 General Motors, Ford F, -0.11% and Fiat Chrysler FCAU, -0.81%.\n\nIn the process of our research we also gained an understanding of what makes an auto strike successful. Essentially, for a strike to achieve its aims, workers need sufficient leverage over production to be able to disrupt normal functioning for long enough that it would be cheaper for the company to offer the concessions. Put another way, workers have to cause the auto maker enough pain to make it cry uncle.\n\nThe longer and more disruptive a strike is, the larger the concessions. Higher levels of what we call structural leverage mean that a relatively small number of workers can cause maximal disruption.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, General Motors produced cars using a just-in-time delivery system called \u201cflexible production.\u201d The auto maker carried no stockpiles of inventory; it ordered vehicle components as it needed them. It also clustered its suppliers \u2014 which were often the sole source of key parts \u2014 around its American plants, where virtually all of its cars were built at the time.\n\nThis made it easy for striking workers to cause the disruption they needed to extract major concessions from GM. For example, the Flint strike in 1936 and 1937 resulted in the closure of key plants, which shut down 75% of GM\u2019s production.\n\nThis high level of structural leverage helped UAW strikes to be consistently successful, whether they were national strikes or small wildcat strikes conducted by workers against the will of leadership.\n\nLosing leverage\n\nThings look different today.\n\nGM and other U.S. auto companies abandoned flexible production during the 1950s and \u201860s to weaken labor\u2019s leverage, as we learned in our research. Today GM carries large stockpiles of inventory, and its suppliers and assembly plants are located all over the world. Just 28% of its workforce is in the U.S., and its cars don\u2019t rank high on an index measuring how much of a car is made in the United States.\n\nThe result of the current production structure is that while a national strike shuts down U.S. production, that is only a minor part of GM\u2019s total capacity.\n\nFurther, the strike\u2019s expected costs to GM are a drop in its bucket. Some analysts are estimating that the strike will cost GM $50 million to $100 million per day. Even if the strike lasts a month, that\u2019s a tiny fraction of GM\u2019s $147 billion in 2018 sales.\n\nFinally, union leadership hampered the strike\u2019s effectiveness before it even began by publicly announcing their plan. This gave GM extra time to prepare by stocking up on inventory.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that it\u2019s impossible for auto workers to launch a successful strike in today\u2019s environment. It\u2019s just that it\u2019ll take a lot longer. And this matters because striking workers suffer during strikes. Their pay goes from $16 to $38 per hour to about $1.25 per hour, which they get out of the union\u2019s strike fund.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not impossible that workers will wait out GM and win major concessions, but given the structure they are operating in, it is unlikely.\n\nNow read Tim Mullaney: GM can\u2019t afford to give those striking workers what they want\n\nJoshua Murray is an assistant professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University.
