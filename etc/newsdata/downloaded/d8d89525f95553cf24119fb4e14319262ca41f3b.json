That hasn\u2019t happened. In fact, it looks like it probably won\u2019t happen.\n\nDorian is going to curb stomp parts of the Caribbean and then head north but stay at sea paralleling the US coastline.\n\nHere is today's incredible full day 1-min GOES-16 animation of #Hurricane #Dorian. Its structure has remained remarkably consistent today with no signs of an eyewall replacement cycle imminent. pic.twitter.com/nWMclrd7Za \u2014 Philippe Papin (@pppapin) August 31, 2019\n\nThe most recent storm track shows it paralleling the coast and dying out somewhere off North Carolina late next week.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/NHC_Atlantic/status/1168549103564779520\n\nWhile it sucks to be in the vicinity of the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos, we should thank our guardian angels that the storm is not going to come ashore in the United States.\n\nHaving said that, the storm generated some of the most highly-charged stupidity in recent memory. A former Canadian (naturally) prime minister was cheering for the hurricane to hit Trump\u2019s Mar-A-Lago estate (see this from Sister Toldjah). She wasn\u2019t alone among the blue-check Twitter fellatistas who were hoping for billions of dollars in property damage and hundreds, if not thousands, of deaths to be able to get their OrangeManBad on.\n\nHurricane Dorian is now projected to grow into a Cat. 4 storm. One of the most accurate storm predictions, the European Model expects a track that would strike a full frontal blow on Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida.#ThursdayThoughts pic.twitter.com/x7y7HfPVsP \u2014 Grant Stern (@grantstern) August 29, 2019\n\nAnd, of course, some tied it to anthropogenic global warning, the apparent religion of the less-than-bright left.\n\nTrump: Climate change is a hoax. Earth \ud83c\udf0d: Here\u2019s a Category 4 hurricane with 130+ mph winds aimed right at Mar-a-Lago, with my compliments. pic.twitter.com/NDkSzJB0sh \u2014 David Leavitt (@David_Leavitt) August 29, 2019\n\nBut since he said it, consider this. We know a great deal about hurricanes because they cause a large amount of property damage and loss of life. Trying to understand hurricanes has had significant interest since the 18th century when the Royal Navy in the Caribbean would change its base of operation to Halifax, Nova Scotia, each June to avoid hurricane season. By trying to understand them, we can avoid or mitigate potentially catastrophic evens. Friday, this storm was going to hit Florida on Saturday morning. It didn\u2019t and won\u2019t. But the same lackwits bleating about global warming want us to believe that their models, which are wildly inaccurate even in retrospective analysis, are able to predict net changes in the earth\u2019s temperature within a fraction of a degree some decades into the future. You really can\u2019t have both of these things existing. If you can\u2019t accurately forecast a highly studied and localized phenomenon you certainly can\u2019t forecast with any accuracy macro- and micro-climate changes decades in the future.\n\n#Dorian updated track around the holiday and what to expect. pic.twitter.com/BOFDHeAAL5 \u2014 thestoreyofbrooke (@storeyofbrooke) September 2, 2019\n\n=========\n\n=========\n\nLike what you see?
