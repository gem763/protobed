Well, according to his pastor, that is.\n\nAdam Tyson, the pastor at Placerita Bible Church, sat down recently with Apologia \u2013 a Christian radio and podcast, which proudly has an anti-abortion poster in its podcast studio (????) \u2013 to chat about his life as a God-serving man, and what it was like when Kanye West stepped into his church back in May.\n\n\u201cOne time he told me he wasn\u2019t going to rap,\u201d Tyson said.\n\nI said \u2018why not?\u2019 and he said \u201cWell that\u2019s the Devil\u2019s music\u201d and I said \u2018Hey man, rap is a genre. You can rap for God\u2019 I think he was already thinking about it a little bit, but I just definitely said \u2018Hey bro, I think you need to use your talents that God\u2019s given you, and use that platform for God.\u2019 I think he was definitely thinking about that and I\u2019m not going to take any credit for it but I definitely said \u2018Hey man, have you heard of Lecrae?\u2019 and he said \u201cNo.\u201d \u2018Ya heard of Flame?\u2019 \u201cNo.\u201d \u2018Tedashi?\u2019 \u201cNo.\u201d \u2018Trip Lee?\u2019 \u201cNope.\u201d He hadn\u2019t heard of any of those guys.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s more alarming here, that Kanye very nearly quit rap for good because he didn\u2019t want to piss off God with his rhymes, or the fact that he doesn\u2019t know anything about other Christian rappers \u2013 who even I, a very white woman in Melbourne, know about.\n\nI guess all we have to do is give big thanks to Pastor Adam showing Kanye the way to the light, and by \u2018light\u2019 I mean \u2018Kirk Franklin\u2019s greatest hits\u2019 and like, literally every rapper with a vague interest in the Big Beat Man upstairs.", "description": "Adam Tyson, the pastor at Kanye's home church, spoke about his relationship with Kanye and how he taught him about other prominent Christian rappers.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/kanye-met-gala-2019-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
