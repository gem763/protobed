It marks the seventh consecutive year Apple and Google took the top positions.\n\nApple\u2019s brand was valued at $234,241m, Google\u2019s at $167,713m, and Amazon\u2019s $125,263m. Apple\u2019s brand value grew by 9% on last year, while Google\u2019s grew by 8%.\n\nHowever, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook (FB) slipped out of the top 10 after a difficult year for the company marred by privacy scandals and a multibillion dollar fine from US regulators. Facebook was ranked ninth most valued brand in the world in 2018 but slipped to fourteenth in 2019. Facebook\u2019s brand value has fallen by 11.8% since last year, Interbrand estimate.\n\nFacebook first entered the ranking at number 69 in 2012. At its peak in 2017, Facebook was ranked eighth with a brand value of $48,188m.\n\nInterbrand bases its valuations on: the financial performance of the branded products or services; the role the brand plays in purchase decisions; and the brand\u2019s competitive strength and ability to create loyalty. Brand value is therefore different to a company\u2019s market value, although this is taken into account.\n\nREAD MORE: Apple's iPhone 11 is the best phone Apple has ever produced\n\nThe rise in brand values for top performers was driven in part by surging share prices. Amazon\u2019s stock has jumped by 424% in the last five years, and Apple and Google\u2019s share price has rise over 100% in the same period.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) ($108,847m), Coca-Cola (KO) ($63,365m), Samsung ($61,098m), Toyota ($56,246m), Mercedes-Benz ($50,832m), McDonald\u2019s ($45,362m) and Disney (DIS) ($44,352) filled out the top 10.\n\nREAD MORE: Five excellent ETFs under $20\n\nTop 10 most valuable brands in the world\n\nApple ($234,241m) Google ($167,713m) Amazon ($125,263m) Microsoft ($108,847m) Coca-Cola ($63,365m) Samsung ($61,098m) Toyota ($56,246m) Mercedes-Benz ($50,832m) McDonald\u2019s ($45,362m) Disney ($44,352)\n\nUber made the Best Global Brands rankings for the first time this year at number 87, with a value of $5,714m. LinkedIn also entered the list at number 98. The professional social networking site\u2019s brand was valued at $4,836m.\n\nThe report revealed the top growing sector for brands in 2019 was luxury. This sector had the highest average brand value change against last year\u2019s figures, rising from $105,783 to $117,785 \u2013 a growth rate of 11%.\n\nMastercard was the leading growth brand, shifting eight places to number 62 as a result of a quarter increase in brand value to $9,430m.\n\nA comparison of the top 10 brands in the world, as ranked by brand Value, today and in 2000.
