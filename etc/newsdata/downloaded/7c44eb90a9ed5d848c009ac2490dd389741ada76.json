Yovanovitch is currently a diplomat in residence at Georgetown University.\n\nRead the prepared remarks here:\n\n\n\nCover: Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, center, arrives on Capitol Hill, Friday, Oct. 11, 2019, in Washington, as she is scheduled to testify before congressional lawmakers on Friday as part of the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.
