We'll be out working and making sure we maintain our sharpness throughout the tournament.\"\n\nCole squirmed a little when asked about life under Jones, whose abrasive style has ruffled feathers wherever the Australian has gone.\n\n\"It's never easy because he sets such high demands,\" admitted Cole. \"Eddie pushes the team hard but if you want to be successful you've got to be pushed hard and the boys have responded to that.\"\n\n\"Eddie has won World Cups before and been in World Cup finals. He has the experience and has been there before and done it. He has a plan and he's never satisfied with what's happened before -- Eddie brings that ability to make sure everybody is aligned.\"\n\nDefense coach John Mitchell also denied that England were concerned about weather disruptions as Typhoon Hagibis nears, also putting this week's Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka at risk.\n\n\"We don't let that kind of noise deter our preparation,\" he said about alarmist weather reports.\n\n\"We pride ourselves on being adaptable and flexible for anything that's thrown at us,\" added Mitchell, who confirmed that England are likely to rest Billy Vunipola's sore ankle until the quarterfinals. \"Ultimately if there are factors outside of our control, we'll find other ways to prepare.\"\n\nMitchell brushed off suggestions that England's 44-8 Six Nations thrashing of France at Twickenham earlier this year would give them a psychological advantage this weekend.\n\n\"That really hasn't come into our thinking,\" said the New Zealander.\n\n\"World Cup rugby is a totally different beast -- it's a one-off and has its different pressures. As you can see from some of the big games in this tournament, the pressure is immense.\"\n\nEngland, still the only northern hemisphere side to lift the World Cup after Jonny Wilkinson's extra-time drop goal floored Jones' Australia in the 2003 final, are unbeaten in Pool C after wins over Tonga (35-3), the United States (45-7) and Argentina (39-10).\n\nBut Cole conceded that the English -- who have minor injury concerns over Joe Marler (back) and Jack Nowell (hamstring) -- have yet to hit top gear.\n\n\"We want to keep the momentum going that we've built in the first three games,\" said the Leicester prop. \"We haven't played our best game of rugby yet -- that's evident from the first three games, but we're still building and still getting better.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "England will not suffer from any loss of momentum if this weekend's Rugby World Cup clash with France is cancelled due to violent weather, prop Dan Cole insisted Wednesday.
