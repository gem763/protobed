That's unacceptable.'\n\nThe hanger features clips for hanging skirts and a central bar over which you can drape trousers or long dresses.\n\nAsked what makes it a viable alternative, Roland said: 'It's fully sustainable. In strength it's strong, I think it's stronger than a normal hanger.\n\n'The colour, the grey which is the normal colour of marine plastic, the blue of the hook, and the logo on the back of it that it's a sustainable hanger.\n\nThe UK fashion industry uses 1.5billion plastic hangers every year, according to figures from Mainetti, global manufacturers of garment hangers\n\n'The moment you break it, it's completely recyclable. Something that becomes so circular that nothing goes back to the sea.'\n\nAsked whether fast fashion in itself is sustainable, Roland replied: 'One of the trends of the 90s was the must-have. And the must-have was treated as an addiction.\n\n'Fast fashion creates the same trend; every time, if you don't buy it, you're going to be unhappy, and at the moment, if you buy it you can throw it away.\n\n'We thought it will carry on, it fell apart, it's falling apart now and that's why we have to make a change.'\n\nAt last month's London Fashion Week, Roland offered 300 of his new hangers for free to most designers, but only around 20 per cent accepted them.\n\nRoland has teamed up with Dutch company Arch and Hook to produce a hanger with a much longer shelf life, using 80 per cent marine plastic found floating in the ocean, and 20 per cent recyclable plastic, with aluminium blue hooks\n\nAn investigation by the Mail On Sunday in August established plastic coat hangers are an environmental menace so serious they could soon outstrip the damage caused by plastic bags, straws and bottles.\n\nBird and marine life is already affected, with discarded hangers seen lodged around the necks and legs of animals across the world.\n\nThere is growing support for a war on plastic hangers, with politicians, campaign groups and even the hanger industry itself demanding a compulsory 5p charge, similar to the successful levy on plastic bags.\n\nThe hanger mountain has been described as a scandal 'hidden in plain sight'.\n\nAt last month's London Fashion Week, Roland offered 300 of his new hangers for free to most designers, but only around 20 per cent accepted them\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex, pictured while pregnant in January wearing a sparkling Roland Mouret gown at the premiere of Cirque du Soleil's Totem in support of Sentebale at the Royal Albert Hall\n\n'Most clothes can be sold and stored by simply folding them,' said Louise Edge, of Greenpeace.\n\n'Too many big retailers are handing out plastic hangers to customers for free when they\u2019re often just pointless packaging. How many people hang their undies in a wardrobe?'\n\nAllison Ogden-Newton, chief executive of environmental charity Keep Britain Tidy, said: 'It is a scandal that billions of coat hangers every year are simply being dumped in landfill. It\u2019s just another example of a society that is trashing our planet with plastic. Retailers should stop giving them away. And consumers should refuse them at the shop if they don\u2019t plan to reuse them.'", "description": "French fashion designer Roland Mouret, 58, claims garment hangers are as bad for the environment as plastic straws and has helped to develop\u00a0what he believes is the world's only sustainable version.", "authors": ["Hayley Richardson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/18/20340544-0-image-a-68_1572372314790.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
