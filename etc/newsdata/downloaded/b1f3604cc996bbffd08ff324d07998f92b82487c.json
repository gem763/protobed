He is not on social media, he said, \u201cso I don\u2019t experience the Twitter rage except through the accounts of a couple of friends who have not learned that they shouldn\u2019t tell me about these things\u201d.\n\nJonathan Franzen\u2019s right: you need to pick your battles | Oliver Burkeman Read more\n\nFranzen said that he found it \u201csurprising, if not disheartening, to learn that the messenger was being attacked even if the facts of the message were not being challenged \u2026 In the context of a threatened social order, the kind of polarisation and hysteria and real hate speech that is occurring primarily on the internet, much less often face to face, is part of the problem.\u201d\n\nIn his September New Yorker article, Franzen shared his belief that a climate apocalypse is unavoidable and so it is \u201cimportant to fight smaller, more local battles that you have some realistic hope of winning\u201d. Among his critics were scientists, who particularly objected to his statement that \u201cconsensus among scientists and policymakers is that we\u2019ll pass this point of no return if the global mean temperature rises by more than two degrees Celsius\u201d.\n\nFranzen admitted that his claim about warming could have been expressed more clearly.\n\n\u201cThat remark about things spiralling out of control past the two degree point was in the context of saying we should have as substantial and immediate reductions in carbon emissions as we possibly can \u2013 not only because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but because it will at least, if nothing else, somewhat slow the pace of change and give us time to prepare and adapt and become more resilient. Obviously, a world of two degrees is better than a world of seven degrees,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the New Yorker, he urged readers to \u201csave what you love specifically \u2013 a community, an institution, a wild place, a species that\u2019s in trouble \u2013 and take heart in your small successes\u201d. Franzen is on the board of American Bird Conservancy, and has written extensively about the need to protect birds.\n\n\u201cI feel like all I do is fail, but every once in a while we have some little success and that was really the ultimate message of my New Yorker piece,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to probably save anything permanently but, to save something for a while, to watch a formerly wrecked place recover ecologically, to see a species that you care about whose population was declining rebounding \u2013 I have hope for those places, and I have hope for those species. In the context of the larger failure, that is not nothing.\u201d\n\nFranzen supports Extinction Rebellion, which is in the middle of two weeks of protests in London. \u201cIt\u2019s different from some of the earlier climate activist organisations over here. I appreciate that and I\u2019m all for it,\u201d he told the activists\u2019 podcast.", "description": "In an interview with Extinction Rebellion, the novelist said he found the negative response to his writing about the climate crisis \u2018surprising, if not disheartening\u2019", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8817d81a7b11c2677512dcc1496691c3db12da47/0_876_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=049c164e7dfcbe3e6ca2cf8ee66dbde3", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
