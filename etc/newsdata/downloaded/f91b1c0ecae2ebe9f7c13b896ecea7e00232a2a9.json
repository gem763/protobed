(Nate Gaskin via AP)\n\nBy LEANNE ITALIE\n\nWhile trying to lose weight, Becky Beach found assistance in an unlikely place: thousands of online videos featuring people binging on massive amounts of ramen, burgers, chicken wings and seafood boils brimming with crab and lobster.\n\nThe South Korea-rooted video trend is known as \u201cmukbang,\u201d and it has spread to the U.S. and around the globe on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.\n\n\u201cI watch one whenever I feel like eating sweets or bad foods,\u201d said Beach, a Dallas-based product designer for a Fortune 500 company. She has lost 10 pounds and views up to three mukbang videos a day. \u201cIt\u2019s just satisfying to watch.\u201d\n\nAshley Cobb, a math teacher in Washington, D.C., is also a fan after one of her eighth-graders turned her on to the videos.\n\nCobb said it\u2019s \u201cfun and soothing\u201d to watch people dip food in sauce and \u201ceat with so much enjoyment.\u201d The footage transports her to \u201ca different place\u201d and \u201chas a way of making you leave reality for a second, sort of like a good book.\u201d\n\nSuch glowing feedback is pure gold to top creators like Bethany Gaskin in suburban Cincinnati. The 44-year-old, who has 2.2 million subscribers to her Bloveslife channel on YouTube, is a top earner, clearing more than $1 million in ad money as she eats her way through seafood boils, ginormous servings of barbecue ribs and other drool-worthy spreads.\n\nShe recently put out a Cajun butter dipping sauce, Bloves Smackalicious, and counts Cardi B and Amber Rose among her 1.1 million followers on Instagram.\n\n\u201cI started off trying to cook in videos,\u201d Gaskin said. \u201cI cook really well, then people wanted to see me eat. I unapologetically eat whatever I want, however I want, food dripping down my chin.\u201d\n\nGaskin has some advice for critics who say the excess of mukbang promotes an unhealthy lifestyle: \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t watch.\u201d\n\nThe word mukbang is a mashup of the Korean words for \u201ceating\u201d and \u201cbroadcast,\u201d translating in English to \u201ceatcast.\u201d Livestreams in South Korea started sprouting up around 2009. It didn\u2019t take long for fans to catch on and YouTubers to cash in.\n\n\u201cThe core principle behind mukbang is that eating is a social activity,\u201d said Victor Chang, marketing manager for the South Korea-based fried chicken restaurant chain Bonchon. It\u2019s \u201ca way of connecting people through meals even when they are miles apart.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s wings appear frequently in videos.\n\nThe mukbang phenomena is not focused on fancy food. It\u2019s \u201cmore about the `treat yourself\u2019 moment and the simple joy of casual conversation over a no-frills, delicious meal,\u201d Chang said.\n\nSome mukbangers avoid speaking in their videos, using specialized microphones to heighten the crunches and slurps. Others like Gaskin are in it for the chatter. Visiting with Gaskin on YouTube as she talks, dips and eats feels like catching up with a neighbor over the backyard fence.\n\nAt 4-foot-11 and about 130 pounds, Gaskin said she\u2019s able to put away the amounts of food that she devours on camera due in part to her high metabolism. During a 30-minute video, she said she may actually eat for only 11 to 15 minutes.\n\nGaskin, who grew up poor in Chicago, was making circuit boards for the military in January 2017, when she put up her first mukbang video. She retired from her day job that May. Her husband, Nate Gaskin, retired after 20 years at General Electric to help manage her mukbang career, which is packed with speaking engagements, Make-a-Wish visits with sick kids and brand deals.\n\nTo round out the family affair, their two sons the youngest is 18 are also earning incomes from mukbang.\n\nSo does Nicholas Perry, 27. He\u2019s a classically trained violinist who gave up that career struggle for mukbang in 2016. He started with videos focused on the vegan lifestyle he followed for about five years. Then he gave up veganism for junk food-fueled mukbangs that go deep into his personal life. He messily answers viewer questions, burps and chows down with regular \u201cmmm, mmm, mmmmms.\u201d\n\nPerry has three mukbang channels under the handle Nikocado Avocado, with 1.72 million subscribers on the largest. He would not reveal how much money he earns.\n\n\u201cOne of my friends told me to try it out,\u201d he said from his home outside Philadelphia. \u201cI thought she was crazy. I said to myself, \u2018Who on Earth is going to watch me eat food? Sure enough, my very first mukbang got like 50,000 views in a couple of weeks, which was a lot for me at the time, and everybody was asking, when\u2019s the next mukbang?\u201d\n\nAfter gaining weight, Perry tries to counter all the fast food with exercise and nutrition off screen.\n\n\u201cI just want to do this for a couple more years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt IS very unhealthy.\u201d\n\nBrittany Marsicek, 28, a dancer, actor and YouTuber, has a 2-year-old Mukbang Monday channel with Chantal Plamondon, 27. The two focus on vegan food, but Marsicek eats and chats her way through non-vegan videos on some Wednesdays when she goes solo or teams up with her boyfriend.\n\nMarsicek and Plamondon often film in their cars while munching from food containers, rather than making videos featuring a spread of food and people who mostly \u201cjust gorge,\u201d Marsicek said.\n\nConsumer psychologist Michal Strahilevitz, an associate professor of marketing at Saint Mary\u2019s College of California, said mukbang \u201cmay seem crazy\u201d at first, but \u201cwatching people binge eat is a whole lot healthier than binge eating yourself.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cOf course, there's also the risk that this is modeling bad behavior and making it socially acceptable, particularly with younger viewers.\u201d\n\nBeach\u2019s assessment? At least as it applies to her weight-loss goals: \u201cIt\u2019s weird, but it works!\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
