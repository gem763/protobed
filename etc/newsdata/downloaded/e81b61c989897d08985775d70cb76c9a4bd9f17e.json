The police officer then told me to take everything off, including my underwear,' she told the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission.\n\nThe girl said at an inquiry that she felt 'completely humiliated' by the experience and 'couldn't stop crying' as she was forced to strip naked in front of authorities (pictured: sniffer dogs at a music festival)\n\n'At that point, I realised I was going to have to get naked in front of this police officer. I could not believe that this was happening to me. I could not stop crying.'\n\nThe schoolgirl said she had a pantyliner in her underwear.\n\nShe was told to remove it and hand it to police to inspect.\n\nAfter being told to squat, she said the police officer also squatted down and looked underneath her.\n\nAfter the search produced no results, the officer told her to get dressed and head back to the festival.\n\n'I was extremely upset. I was sobbing. I sat with my friend trying to calm down. I did not stop crying.'\n\nAfter being told to squat, she said the police officer also squatted down and looked underneath her (pictured: a sniffer dog)\n\nThe girl shared her shock, claiming she was scared to make eye contact with a police officer at the festival for the remaining three days of the festival.\n\nShe described how difficult it would be for her to report an actual issue to police at the festival if necessary.\n\nUnder NSW law, police are not allowed to carry out a field strip search unless the situation is classified as urgent.\n\nIf a strip search is conducted on a minor, a parent or guardian must be present unless it's necessary to protect the person.\n\nThe inquiry revealed seven minors were strip searched at the 2018 all-ages event.\n\nOf the 143 strip searches conducted on festival goers, 90 per cent were false detections.\n\nThe inquiry continues.", "description": "The teenager, then 16, attended the Splendour in the Grass music festival in Byron Bay, New South Wales, last year when she was flagged by police sniffer dogs at the festival entrance.", "authors": ["Charlotte Karp For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/12/19988560-0-image-a-18_1571658202673.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
