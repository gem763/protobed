Previously listed as temporary directors for legal reasons, lead communications secretary Sara Latham and former civil service commissioner Natalie Campbell were both removed from the list of officers at Sussex Royal, according to The Express.\n\nAccording to The Daily Mail, they've been replaced by Stefan Allesch-Taylor, a \"coffee tycoon\" and entrepreneurship professor of King's College London, and Steven Cooper, former Barclays businessman and CEO of the U.K.'s oldest privately owned bank, C. Hoare & Co.\n\nThe Sussex Royal Foundation was set up when the Fab Four's joint Royal Foundation split up in June, with Harry and Meghan establishing their own vehicle for their charitable work. The two couples had headed up the joint venture since Markle joined the royal family upon her marriage to Harry. Before that, the Royal Foundation was led by Harry and William, with Kate added when she married William in 2011.\n\nAllesch-Taylor is an owner and operator of at least three London-based coffee brands, The Department of Coffee and Social Affairs, Nordic Bakery and Baker & Spice (aka, plenty of caffeine choices for the duke and duchess as they travel around Africa with their 4-month-old baby, Archie) and was named one of London's most influential people in both 2017 and 2018 by the London Evening Standard. He also holds the \"CBE\" (Commander of the British Empire) distinction and served as judge at the 2016 BAFTA awards. He's executive produced 25 short films since 2010.\n\nThe coffee founder and professor is also founder of the Afri-CAN Children's Charity based in Malawi and South Africa, which builds preschools and helps provide free school breakfasts to more than 3,000 children in vulnerable areas near Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nDoes his work with Afri-CAN help with the Sussexes' upcoming itinerary for their Royal Tour of Africa? We guess we'll have to wait and see\u2026\n\nRELATED: Prince Harry Steps Out to Celebrate a Very Special Anniversary\u2026Without Meghan", "description": "America might run on Dunkin', but Meghan and Harry run on fancy schmancy coffee (and their new choice of directors proves it).Less than two weeks after Meghan and Prince Harry removed two names from their...", "authors": ["Editor Purewow.Com", "Purewow"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mRL2lsz7jEO6DOIXV9ksKw--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xMTkwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/purewow_185/172f05c014432ca36fe3423c7f4d8a5f", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
