But Elton\u2019s older half-brother Geoff argues that wasn\u2019t the case and claims Stanley was actually \u2018proud\u2019 of the singer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking to The Mirror, Geoff said: \u2018I don\u2019t understand because my mum, my dad and me, we all went to see him as his guests in Liverpool.\n\n\u2018That was definitely a concert, my dad was definitely there, he was definitely playing and we definitely watched it. I was five.\u2019\n\nThe 53-year-old said of Elton: \u2018Either he has got massive memory loss and he genuinely thinks his dad hasn\u2019t seen him in concert or maybe he wants to believe that.\u2019\n\nMe: Elton John is released 15 October.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
