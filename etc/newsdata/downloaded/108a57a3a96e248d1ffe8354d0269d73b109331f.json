Yes, please!", "language": "en", "text": "Overview\n\nThis nourishing bowl is like the cashmere throw of soups \u2014 cozy and comforting, in the most luxurious, stylish way. Made with cauliflower that gets simmered with shallots and potato, in broth, until softened, and then blended until smooth, the soup is ultra-creamy and filling. (The potato gives it an extra layer of satisfying body.)\n\nThat lovely off-white puree becomes the canvas for a spray of toppings, which amplify its earthy, nutty flavors, while contrasting its creaminess: an exciting mix of meaty sauteed mushrooms, kissed with sherry vinegar and tossed with crunchy toasted hazelnuts and fresh parsley.\n\nThe resulting warm bowl of goodness is a first-class upgrade from your basic pureed vegetable soup.\n\n[10 plant-based soup recipes to warm your body and soul]\n\nNote: If possible, purchase hazelnuts that have already had their skins removed. If they are not available, once you have toasted and cooled the nuts, place them on one side of a clean kitchen towel, fold the towel over the nuts and rub vigorously to remove any loose skins. It is okay if some skins remain.\n\nMake ahead: The soup and topping (minus the hazelnuts) may both be made up to 4 days ahead and stored in separate airtight containers in the refrigerator. (Add the hazelnuts to the topping just before serving to keep them crunchy.)\n\nStorage: The soup can be refrigerated, tightly covered, for up to 4 days.\n\nIngredients\n\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n\n1/2 cup chopped shallots (about 4 medium shallots)\n\n1 medium head cauliflower, cored and cut into 1-inch florets (about 6 cups)\n\nOne (6-ounce) Yukon Gold potato, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces\n\n4 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth\n\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\n1/2 cup hazelnuts (see note)\n\n4 ounces mixed mushrooms, such as cremini, shiitake and chanterelles, stemmed, sliced and coarsely chopped\n\n1 tablespoon sherry vinegar\n\n2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley\n\nSteps\n\nStep 1\n\nIn a large pot over medium heat, warm 1 tablespoon of oil until shimmering. Add the shallots and cook, stirring, until they have softened a bit but have not browned, about 1 minute. Add the cauliflower, potato, broth, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and bring to a boil.\n\nStep 2\n\nReduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until the cauliflower and potato are very tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Using an immersion blender, puree until smooth, or let cool slightly and puree in 3 to 4 batches in a regular blender.\n\nStep 3\n\nWhile the soup cooks, make the topping: Place the hazelnuts in a dry medium skillet over medium heat and toast, shaking the pan frequently, until the nuts are fragrant and lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the nuts to a bowl and let cool. Remove the skins if necessary (see note), then coarsely chop.\n\nStep 4\n\nWipe the skillet clean with a paper towel. Return the pan to the heat and warm 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until they release their liquid and start to brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vinegar. Stir in the hazelnuts, parsley, the remaining tablespoon of oil and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper.\n\nTo serve, ladle about a cup of soup into each bowl and top each with about 2 heaping tablespoons of the topping.\n\nFrom nutritionist and cookbook author Ellie Krieger, a registered dietitian nutritionist and author who hosts public television\u2019s \u201cEllie\u2019s Real Good Food.\u201d Her new cookbook \u201cWhole in One: Complete Healthy Meals in a Single Pot, Sheet Pan or Skillet\u201d was recently released.
