Authorities publicized a photo of him Saturday and asked for help locating him as a person considered \u201carmed and dangerous.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHis father, in an interview Wednesday, said that his 25-year-old son spoke of visiting the shop over the repair issue and also that his son has been using the synthetic marijuana often known as K2. Court documents also state the younger man has tested positive for synthetic cannabinoids.\n\nD.C. police arrested Moises Alexander Delcid after spotting him sitting on a concrete wall at K and 19th streets NW. An arrest affidavit says he fled on a bicycle, yelling \u201cDon\u2019t chase \u2014 I\u2019ll shoot you,\u201d and was caught a block away. A police report says he had a loaded Mossberg .22-caliber pistol, similar to a Tec-9, in his backpack, and an additional 195 rounds of ammunition.\n\nA federal grand jury Wednesday indicted Delcid on a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm. He has a felony conviction in Virginia for grand larceny and was on probation, court files show.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn court Thursday, Delcid entered a plea of not guilty through his attorney, Assistant Federal Defender Michelle Peterson. He will remain held pending a detention hearing in two weeks while seeking fast-tracked plea talks with prosecutors, Peterson told U.S. Magistrate Deborah A. Robinson of the District.\n\nDelcid did not speak during the hearing and appeared in an orange prison uniform with his right arm in a blue sling. Delcid nodded and gave a short wave to his father, who sat in courtroom.\n\nPeterson declined to comment after the hearing.\n\nFederal prosecutors wrote in court documents that Delcid had repeatedly failed to comply with court-ordered supervision in the Virginia case and after a D.C. conviction for driving under the influence, and said there is a \u201cdanger to any person or the community posed by the defendant\u2019s release.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe elder Delcid described his son as troubled but said he doesn\u2019t believe he posed a threat. \u201cBut of course he is my son, and I\u2019m going to say he\u2019s not capable of the things the police think he was going to do. I just speak as a father,\u201d he said.\n\nThe elder Delcid said his son is a mechanic who grew up in the District and has a young son and daughter. He said his son used to work in the shop he allegedly targeted and had recently bought a dirt bike there for $2,000 but grew frustrated by repairs it needed.\n\nAn employee at the store confirmed in an interview Wednesday that the younger Delcid had worked there for about one month before the incident. The employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing concerns about safety, confirmed that Delcid had been upset about a motorcycle purchased at the shop, but he said he also had other personal problems that created conflict.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPrince George\u2019s police said the younger Delcid visited the store Oct. 3, \u201cdemanded service\u201d and threatened an employee. Police said he returned three hours later wearing a military-style, bullet-\n\nresistant vest and armed with what they described as the assault-style weapon.\n\nAuthorities said he went back a third time Oct. 4 and pointed a gun. Delcid\u2019s father said his son told him it was a pellet gun.\n\nThe elder Delcid said he talked to his son a few hours before his arrest and noted his son had said he would be returning to the District. \u201cI told him, \u2018Why did you do that?\u2019 \u201d referring to the alleged threats at the store. \u201cI told him that\u2019s going to be a big problem.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Police said he fired a shot in the air from an assault-style firearm.
