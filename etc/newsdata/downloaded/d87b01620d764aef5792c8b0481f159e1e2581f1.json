Interest on public debts paid by the Treasury in 2019 rose nearly 10 percent to $572.8 billion.\n\nThat handily surpassed the $409.4 billion in federal spending on Medicaid, the health insurance program covering scores of millions of low-income Americans.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 America\u2019s budget deficit soared to nearly $1 trillion in the 2019 fiscal year as government borrowing swelled, the US", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/85b9b4_stacks-president-donald-trump-fy2018-budget-proposal-in-may-2017-us-budget-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
