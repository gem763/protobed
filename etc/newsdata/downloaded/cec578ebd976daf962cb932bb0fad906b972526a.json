Prices are in a large sideways pattern but below the rising 40-week moving average line. The $230-$250 area should act as resistance and the $180-$160 area as support.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is neutral but the MACD oscillator has moved below the zero line for an outright sell.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of PANW, below, we can see a potential downside price target of $163.\n\nBottom line strategy: The charts are indicators of PANW leaning towards the downside ahead of earnings.
