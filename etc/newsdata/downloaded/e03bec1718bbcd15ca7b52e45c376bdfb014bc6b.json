REUTERS/Jason Lee/Illustration/File Photo\n\nSterling also pulled back from its highest in five months against the euro as investors took profit and prepared for a make-or-break summit between Britain and the EU on Thursday and Friday.\n\nU.S.-China ties came into focus again as the yuan fell after Beijing criticized new U.S. legislation seen as supportive of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\nIn global currency markets, traders nervously await the latest developments from a last-ditch effort to see whether Britain and the EU can draft an agreement on Brexit before the summit.\n\nReports the two sides were approaching an agreement boosted sterling overnight, though traders said the currency could swing wildly because it is still unclear if Britain can avoid postponing its departure beyond Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cEven if the two sides can agree something, it is unclear if they can stick with the exit deadline,\u201d said Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cWhether Britain\u2019s parliament will approve whatever has been agreed is another big uncertainty. Sterling had a good run-up, but some investors are lightening their positions.\u201d\n\nThe pound GBP=D3 fell 0.24% to $1.2757, pulling back from a five-month high of $1.2800 reached on Tuesday.\n\nAgainst the euro EURGBP=D3, the British currency fell around 0.2% to 86.48 pence. On Tuesday, sterling hit 86.25 pence per euro, the strongest since May 10.\n\nThe pound on Tuesday jumped after Bloomberg News reported that negotiators hoped an agreement would be reached by midnight on Tuesday in Europe, but a lack of news in Asia about the talks helped push the currency lower, traders said.\n\nWithout a Brexit deal, trade from Britain that previously flowed unhindered across the EU\u2019s single market would be subject to customs tariffs and safety inspections, which many fear would cause economic turmoil.\n\nIn Asia, the fresh U.S.-China strains over Hong Kong pushed the safe-haven yen higher, helping it claw back earlier losses, as worries about relations between the economic superpowers and disappointment with efforts to end their trade war marred sentiment.\n\nIn the onshore market, the yuan CNY=CFXS fell around 0.22% to 7.0973 per dollar. In the offshore market, the yuan CNH=D3 was off more than 0.2% to 7.1028 versus the dollar.\n\nA bruising trade war between the United States and China that has dragged on for more than a year has already placed incredible strains on relations between the two countries.\n\nHong Kong has been rocked by months of often violent protests against China\u2019s rule of the former British colony.\n\nAny signs of support from U.S. lawmakers for the protest movement is likely to draw Beijing\u2019s ire and make a resolution to the trade war less likely.\n\nReports of a \u201cPhase 1\u201d trade deal between the United Statesand China last week initially cheered markets but the dearth of details around the agreement has since curbed anyenthusiasm.\n\nThe yen JPY=EBS rose slightly to 108.66 per dollar, pulling away from a two-month low. The yen also rose around 0.4% versus the pound GBPJPY= and around 0.5% against the Australian dollar AUDJPY=.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY against a basket of six currencies rose slightly by 0.04% to 98.323.", "description": "The pound pulled back from its highest level in almost five months versus the dollar on Wednesday, erasing some of the rally sparked by signs Britain is closing in on a deal to leave the European Union.", "authors": ["Stanley White", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441362695&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0BV", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
