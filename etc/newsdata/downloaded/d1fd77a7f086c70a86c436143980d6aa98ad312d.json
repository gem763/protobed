Owner Jerry Jones also immediately turned the attention to Quinn when asked about a possible Charlton trade.\n\n\"I know there is some discussion. We don't get into that,\" Jones said in Week 2, per Jori Epstein of USA Today. \"I am really exciting about getting Robert Quinn back. That is really big for us.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Cowboys used a variety of other players on the defensive line, including Pro Bowler DeMarcus Lawrence, Dorance Armstrong and rookie fifth-round pick Joe Jackson.\n\nIt showed Charlton was low on the depth chart despite starting seven of 11 games played in 2018. The latest transaction likely won't affect Dallas' rotation on the defensive line either this season or going forward.\n\nOn the other hand, the 24-year-old should get a chance at a fresh start with a new team after a disappointing few years with the Cowboys. He could also provide some great value for an organization willing to take a chance on him.\n\nCharlton only totaled four sacks over his first two seasons, but he was able to get quick pressure when given the opportunity as a rookie:\n\nHe also played well against the run in 2018, including his five tackles for a loss. Considering his production at the college level with 10 sacks his senior season at Michigan, there are still high hopes for the young player.\n\nLawrence didn't break out until his fourth year, so you don't want to give up on pass-rushing talent.\n\nIf he gets more snaps with whatever team picks him up, Charlton has a chance to finally reach his potential in the NFL.", "description": "The  Dallas Cowboys  have  announced  they released defensive end  Taco Charlton  after less than three years with the team on Wednesday.
