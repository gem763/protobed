Adam Schiff (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nRepresentatives Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) and Jerry Nadler (D., N.Y.) criticized the Justice Department late Thursday after the DOJ upgraded its inquiry into the origins of the Russia probe into a criminal investigation.\n\nThe investigation, which is expected to delve into the origins of the counterintelligence probe of the Trump campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia, is led by U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut John Durham, and was opened by U.S. Attorney General William Barr.\n\n\u201cThese reports, if true, raise profound new concerns that the Department of Justice under AG Barr has lost its independence and become a vehicle for President Trump\u2019s political revenge,\u201d Nadler and Schiff posted on Nadler\u2019s Twitter account in a joint statement.\n\n\u201cIf the Department of Justice may be used as a tool of political retribution, or to help the President with a political narrative for the next election,\u201d the statement continued, \u201cthe rule of law will suffer new and irreparable damage.\u201d\n\nSchiff heads the House Intelligence Committee, while Nadler is chair of the House Judiciary Committee. Both are heavily involved in the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump.\n\nRepresentative Doug Collins (R., Ga.), the ranking Republican member on the Judiciary Committee defended on Friday the DOJ decision to upgrade its investigation to a criminal probe.\n\n\u201cIf Durham finds crimes were committed, I\u2019m confident he\u2019ll pursue justice and help restore America\u2019s confidence in our premier law enforcement agency,\u201d Collins wrote on Twitter. \u201cChairman Nadler is wrong to suggest this investigation is anything less than an effort to deliver truth and accountability.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Barr opened the investigation to determine whether an FBI probe into the 2016 Trump campaign was politically motivated. At the time, the Trump campaign was accused of collaborating with Russian government officials to win the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nBarr is reportedly looking into the FBI\u2019s use of a FISA warrant against former Trump campaign national security adviser Carter Page, as well as allegations that the agency based its probe on dubious intelligence provided in the Steele dossier.", "description": "Their statement warned against the Department of Justice being used as a tool of political retribution.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Ilya Shapiro", "Mairead Mcardle", "Kevin D.
