That\u2019s the promise of nuclear fusion. So, why are we still relying on fossil fuels?\n\nFor decades, scientists have viewed nuclear fusion as the Holy Grail for clean, abundant and sustainable power. Based on the same principle that powers the stars, including our own sun, a couple of nuclear reactors running on small pellets could power our planet without the risk of a catastrophic meltdown and zero greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nStill, we depend on fossil fuels for 80% of our energy needs.\n\nSo, what\u2019s stopping us from building these reactors everywhere?\n\nAfter all, scientists have been working on nuclear fusion technology since the 1950s and have always been optimistic that the final breakthrough is not far away. Yet, milestones have fallen time and again and now the running joke is that a practical nuclear fusion power plant could still be decades away.\n\nWell, you can blame some kinky laws of physics for this sad state of affairs.\n\nNuclear More\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nExtreme challenge\n\nIt turns out that the conditions necessary for nuclear fusion to take place present an extreme challenge for us earthlings.\n\nFusion works on the basic concept of forging lighter elements into heavier ones. When two hydrogen atoms are smashed together hard enough, they fuse to form helium. The new atom is less massive than the sum of its parts, with the balance converted to energy in the E=MC2 mass-energy equivalence.\n\nOk, that\u2019s a bit simplistic since hydrogen atoms do not fuse together directly but rather in a multi-step reaction. Anyway, the long and short of it is that nuclear fusion produces net energy only at extreme temperatures - in the order of hundreds of millions of degrees celsius. That\u2019s hotter than the sun\u2019s core and far too hot for any known material on earth to withstand.\n\nRelated: There\u2019s Tremendous Room For Growth In Offshore Oil & Gas\n\nTo get around this quagmire, scientists use powerful magnetic fields to contain the hot plasma and prevent it from coming into contact with the walls of the nuclear reactor. That uses a lot of power.\n\nStars have it easy in this regard because their ludicrously powerful gravitational fields hold everything together.\n\nUnfortunately, every fusion experiment so far has been energy negative, taking in more energy than it generates thus making it useless as a form of electricity generation.\n\nGetting the initial fusion reaction is not a problem - keeping it going is, not to mention that building nuclear reactors takes some extremely sophisticated feats of engineering.\n\nInternational megaproject\n\nBut now scientists are confident that they are close to building a nuclear reactor that will produce more energy than it consumes.\n\nThe Saint-Paul-les-Durance, France-based upcoming International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is the world\u2019s largest fusion reaction facility that aims to develop commercially viable fusion reactors.\n\nFunded by six nations including the US, Russia, China, Japan, South Korea and India, ITER plans to build the world\u2019s largest tokamak fusion device, a donut-shaped cage that will produce 500 ME of thermal fusion energy.\n\nThe device will cost ~$24 billion with a delivery date set at 2035. The giant machine - the biggest fusion machine ever built - will weigh in at an impressive 23,000 tonnes and will be housed in a building 60 meters high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: ITER.org", "description": "Nuclear fusion, the holy grail of energy, finally looks like it might become a reality as two projects aim to do what many observers had long since deemed impossible", "authors": ["Alex Kimani"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BBiXVvkV7QzdVkuhUN.xsw--~B/aD0yNTM7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/oilprice.com/f672bf6bc8363d80968536eec49adae4", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
