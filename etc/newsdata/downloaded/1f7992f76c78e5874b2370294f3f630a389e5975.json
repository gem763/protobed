What is your response?' Cox prompted the progressive lawmaker vying for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.\n\n'Well, I'm going to assume it's a guy who said that,' Warren responded of the hypothetical situation, inciting laughter.\n\n'And I'm going to say: 'Then just marry one woman,' she quipped and received a slew of laughter and applause from the audience that lasted almost 20 seconds.\n\n'I'm cool with that,' she continued. 'Assuming you could find one.'\n\nHer zinger, which went viral, was part of marathon CNN town hall where a half dozen top-tier candidates turned out to discuss issues facing the LGBT community.\n\nCox was introduced by moderator Chris Cuomo who said he is part of a 'real estate investment firm in Dallas, Texas. Records indicate, according to the Free Beacon, that Cox has donated to the Human Rights Campaign as well as Democratic congressional candidates Gin Ortiz of Texas, Jennifer Wexton of Virginia, Nancy Soderberg of Florida and Annie Craig of Minnesota.\n\nIt does not appear that he has contributed to any other 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nCNN was also chastised in February for failing to disclose the Democratic Party ties of town hall participants who asked Bernie Sanders, a progressive candidate that could threaten establishment Democrats, harsh questions.\n\nThe network identified Baltimore County Democratic Party chairwoman as a 'former biology professor,' and CNN admitted in a statement it 'should have been more fully identified as any political affiliations.'\n\nCNN did not identify Coz as a Warren donor during his question at the town hall. He asked Warren what she would say to someone that says they believes 'marriage is between one man and one woman.' Warren responded: 'Then just marry one woman. I'm cool with that. Assuming you could find one'\n\nLater during the town hall last Thursday, Warren \u2013 who has recently emerged as the frontrunner candidate it some polls \u2013 more seriously reflected on how faith influences many people's beliefs regarding LGBT issues.\n\n'They are yellow, black and white. They are precious in his sight. Jesus loves all the children of the world,' Warren sang on stage. 'That was the basis of the faith I grew up in.'\n\n'It truly is about the preciousness of each and every life. It is about the worth of every human being,' she continued.\n\nWarren went on to say that while her exposure to the LGBT community was 'gradual' as not many people were out 'in those days' in Oklahoma \u2013 where she grew up \u2013 she was always shocked by the hatefulness towards the community, especially from people of faith.\n\n'I think the whole foundation (of faith) is the worth of every single human being,' Warren said. 'I get people may make decisions for themselves that are different than the decisions other people make. But, by golly, those are decisions about you. They are not decisions that tell other people what they can and cannot do.'\n\nFellow 2020 candidate Pete Buttigieg was also a participant in the town hall. He is the first openly gay man running in a major party's presidential primary race, and if he were to win the whole thing in 2020, he would be the first openly gay president in the White House.\n\nEarlier in the day on Thursday, the South Bend, Indiana mayor released an LGBTQ policy plan that promised banning conversion therapy, supporting the Equality Act and balancing religious liberties with LGBT rights.\n\n'The right to religious freedom ends where religion is being used as an excuse to harm other people,' he said.\n\nBoth Warren and Buttigieg are set to take the stage in Westerville, Ohio Tuesday night alongside 10 other Democratic primary candidates as part of the fourth debate of the 2020 election cycle.\n\nThis is the largest ever Democratic primary debate in modern history.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren's most memorable answer from CNN's LGBT town hall last week was queried by a donor who gave the federal maximum to her 2018 Massachusetts Senate campaign.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/19/19754370-0-image-a-7_1571163569768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
