Just four miles of the planned border wall in Texas is on federal land \u2014 the other 162 lie on private property.\n\nFaced with intense pressure to meet Trump\u2019s 500-mile campaign pledge, administration officials have instead prioritized the lowest-hanging fruit of the barrier project, accelerating construction along hundreds of miles of flat desert terrain under federal control in Western states where the giant steel structure can be erected with relative ease.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat has deferred the tougher work of adding miles of fencing along the zigzagging course of the lower Rio Grande Valley in South Texas, the nation\u2019s busiest corridor for illegal crossings. There, along the winding river\u2019s edge, the land is almost all privately held, and the government would need to obtain it \u2014 either via purchases or eminent domain land grabs \u2014 before any construction begins.\n\nThe government has just started to contact dozens of landowners for permission to visit their farms and ranches for survey work along major stretches of the Texas border.\n\nDavid Acevedo, a rancher and businessman with a 180-acre property south of Laredo, said he does not want to lose land his grandfather purchased more than a century ago. He has granted Border Patrol agents access to his property, but he does not want a giant steel structure on it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI want border security. Put up more cameras, sensors, send more agents and give them drones,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t need a wall.\u201d\n\nThe administration has not had to rely on eminent domain authority to take any private land in South Texas thus far, according to a Department of Homeland Security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to publicly discuss the project.\n\n\u201cSouth Texas brings unique challenges when it comes to land acquisition and construction,\u201d the official said. \u201cAnd we have a river to contend with.\u201d\n\nThe official acknowledged that litigation challenging the use of military funds for the barrier has also hampered the government\u2019s ability to acquire private land in Texas, but crews are still seeking access to properties for survey work.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to move forward with everything we can legally do to get as close to the construction start dates as possible,\u201d the official said.\n\nAs of mid-October, the Trump administration has completed 75 miles of new barrier, but that has gone to replace smaller, older fencing in western states on land the government already controls.\n\nThe president, who ran on a promise to make Mexico pay for the barrier, has obtained nearly $10 billion in U.S. taxpayer funds for the project since 2017, according to the latest project data, including $3.6 billion in diverted military construction funds and $2.5 billion in reprogrammed counternarcotics money. A federal court in El Paso ruled this month that the diversion of the funds to the barrier project was unlawful, a ruling that could put a crimp in the administration\u2019s land acquisition plans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement Friday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said 158 miles of barrier are under construction, while another 276 miles are in a \u201cpreconstruction phase.\u201d Senior CBP officials say they remain on pace to complete 450 miles of barrier by the end of 2020. At rallies, the president has told supporters it will be more. CBP officials declined to comment.\n\nA senior U.S. official with knowledge of the construction plans said there are at least 100 landowners in Texas who will need to give up property for the project, and a small fraction so far have been sent offer letters. Many have yet to receive \u201cright of entry\u201d requests for the government to begin surveying. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the risk of losing their job.\n\nTrump, who has demanded frequent updates on the pace of construction, has been warned by staff that building the barrier on private property in Texas will be difficult. The president has waved off those worries, telling aides to \u201ctake the land.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn recent weeks, the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and other White House officials have met with Homeland Security leaders and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff to map out a strategy for acquiring private land as quickly as possible. Federal officials have also begun meeting with small groups of property owners and their legal representatives to gauge their willingness to grant access to surveyors and work crews.\n\nA few property owners have said publicly they do not want to sell, worried that the fence will limit access to the waterway that is the lifeblood of their crops and cattle. Others own parcels controlled jointly among multiple heirs and family members with conflicting views on whether to cede to the government.\n\nMany in the Laredo area say the barrier project represents a threat to the riparian ecosystem and the cultural heritage of ranchers, farmers and property owners along the Rio Grande. Community members insist they also value border security and the rule of law \u2014 which is why they allow Border Patrol to access their land as part of their enforcement efforts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Rio Grande creates a natural barrier along nearly two-thirds of the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border, and its looping bends and circuitous course make it nearly impossible to build a lineal barrier along the international boundary.\n\nInstead, much fencing will be set atop the earthen levees, many built decades ago, that were installed to control seasonal flooding. Because the distance between the levees and the banks of the Rio Grande can be a half-mile or more in some areas, landowners have expressed concern that a barrier would create large swaths of \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d where privately held land will be walled off between the barrier and the river. Such land is likely to be devalued and in other cases could become useless to owners.\n\nIn New Mexico, Arizona and California, border authorities are able to use a 60-foot-wide ribbon of land known as the \u201cRoosevelt Reservation,\u201d federal property that affords the government access to the international boundary and facilitates barrier construction. But no such easement exists in Texas, where river access is highly valuable.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLandowners who refuse to sell or attempt to hold out for a better price face the risk that the government will seize their property, citing U.S. national security needs.\n\nIlya Somin, an expert on eminent domain at George Mason University\u2019s Antonin Scalia Law School, said the government has broad powers to condemn land and even to begin construction work on property it seizes before compensating the owner.\n\nIf the government and a property owner cannot agree on the amount, a court can establish the property\u2019s fair market value, but \u201ca common problem is people don\u2019t get as much money as the law says they should,\u201d Somin said.\n\nThe government tends to seek to acquire more land than it actually needs, he said, often trying to \u201clowball\u201d property owners because it knows they are wary of a drawn-out legal fight.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe disputes can drag on for years. Some property the U.S. government took for barrier construction after the Secure Fence Act of 2006 remains in litigation, Somin said.\n\nDespite the president\u2019s take-the-land directives, Somin said there are legal obstacles to the administration\u2019s ability to quickly seize large amounts of private land in Texas over the coming months.\n\nIn addition to the recent ruling on the diversion of military funds, the government faces limits in its ability to use eminent domain authority for a project with funding tied up in litigation.\n\n\u201cIt would be a major challenge for them to get all that property quickly given the serious legal arguments that they don\u2019t have the right to use eminent domain,\u201d Somin said.\n\nAnd the government has made little or no progress on several key stretches of Texas riverfront where it plans to build. One segment, known as Laredo 7, calls for 52 miles of barrier between Laredo and Eagle Pass, Tex., but that project is zero percent complete, the latest records show, and its funding is now tied up in a legal fight.\n\nThe barrier could upend ranching operations for some of the largest landowners in Texas. Many properties with water rights rely on a system of 20th century pumps built into the river\u2019s edge that require constant maintenance and monitoring to keep water flowing to crops and fields. A wall, they said, would compromise access to the river for not only the pumps but also cattle grazing and recreation. It also probably would impact property values.\n\nAt an Oct. 17 meeting Acevedo attended with officials from CBP and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the government told landowners that it plans to install gates at every mile along the barrier to preserve rancher and farmer access to the river. Property owners said that access would be far too limiting, attendees said.\n\nSeveral landowners also met one on one with federal officials and received site plans and maps of proposed acreage needed for the wall. Acevedo said he and others were frustrated that the officials lacked clear answers for many of their questions about the barrier\u2019s potential impact.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to realize the complexity this wall will introduce,\u201d Acevedo said.\n\nGovernment officials asked landowners to sign right-of-entry documents at the end of the meetings to allow government engineers to begin surveying their land. Meeting attendees said federal officials told them they did not yet have the funds to start construction but wanted to begin evaluating the land.\n\nBecky Jones, whose family owns a 700-acre farm in the McAllen area farther down the river, said she has been through what the Laredo-area landowners are facing. Jones attended a similar meeting earlier this year when engineers from the Army Corps asked for permission to enter her property for survey work.\n\nShe said other property owners in the area \u201cfeel powerless with regards to the federal government.\u201d\n\nJones said the project will cleave her highly productive farm in two \u2014 350 acres north and south of the proposed barrier, she said.\n\n\u201cWe are locked in a no-win situation,\u201d she said. \u201cBorder Patrol is the security force here, and we don\u2019t want to alienate them either.\u201d\n\nAcevedo estimated that the government is seeking to acquire about 20 percent of his land, based on the site plans CBP provided this month.\n\n\u201cI am one of 16 that own that land,\u201d he said, referring to the family members with whom he shares ownership. \u201cWe are going to have to take a look and get some legal advice.\u201d", "description": "With president promising 500 miles of barriers by next year, construction priorities have been on desert land already under federal control.", "authors": ["Nick Miroff", "Reporter Covering Immigration Enforcement", "The Department Of Homeland Security", "Arelis R.
