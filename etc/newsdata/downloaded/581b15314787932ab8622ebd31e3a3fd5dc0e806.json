REUTERS/Jussi Rosendahl/File Photo\n\nWidely seen as a likely bidder for German industrial group Thyssenkrupp\u2019s elevators division, there have been reports that Kone has offered around 15 billion euros for it.\n\n\u201cWe have said that we are very interested,\u201d Ehrnrooth said when asked by Reuters in an interview whether Kone had made an offer for the Thyssenkrupp business.\n\n\u201cWe believe we would be the best partner for Thyssenkrupp,\u201d Ehrnrooth added after Kone reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt would be an ideal match. Thyssenkrupp\u2019s elevators and Kone would be the best two partners, Ehrnrooth said, listing their different geographic coverage, synergies from overlapping operations and the industry\u2019s digital transformation needs.\n\n\u201cThe main reason why we are doing this is geographic coverage and to obtain more growth,\u201d he added.\n\nEhrnrooth declined to say what synergies Kone calculates it could squeeze out of merging the two businesses.\n\n\u201cWe believe the synergies would be quite remarkable,\u201d he said, adding they would \u201cmean staff cuts in some places but our type of business is geographically very dispersed\u201d.\n\nIn Europe, Kone was more concerned about the continent\u2019s shortage of skilled labor.\n\nRelated Coverage Thyssenkrupp should keep high stake in elevator unit: foundation\n\nAn acquisition would need approval by European competition authorities, but Ehrnrooth said discussions with them would only begin once there was \u201ca real case on their table\u201d.\n\nHe pointed out that the two companies dominate in different geographies, with Kone being strong in Asia while Thyssenkrupp\u2019s best markets are in the Americas.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t discussed selling any of our own assets,\u201d he said, adding \u201cit could well be that we would have to give up some parts of Thyssenkrupp (lift business)\u201d.", "description": "Kone signaled its interest in buying Thyssenkrupp's elevator business on Wednesday, with the Finnish firm's CEO Henrik Ehrnrooth saying it was an \"ideal match\".", "authors": ["Anne Kauranen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444137567&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1BQ", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
