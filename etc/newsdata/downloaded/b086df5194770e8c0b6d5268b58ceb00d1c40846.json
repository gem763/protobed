Borrowers in the program are expected to make 120 payments via specific repayment plans, among other requirements, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office.\n\nINVESTIGATION UNDERWAY AFTER EDUCATION DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEE'S 'FIGURINES AND PICTURES' DAMAGED\n\nThe report comes after the American Federation of Teachers sued Education Secretary Betsy DeVos over the Education Department's handling of its student loan forgiveness program in July.\n\nCongress had set aside $700 million in 2018 to temporarily expand the PSLF program with the goal to forgive the loans of students who didn't initially qualify. Just $27 million of the amount has been used.\n\nThere were 54,184 applications completed between May 2018 and May 2019 for the TEPSLF program and only 661 were approved. Steps were \"not clear to borrowers,\" with many not aware they had to apply for the original PSLF program, even if they knew they didn't qualify, according to the report.\n\nA bulk of all applications -- 71 percent-- were considered ineligible for the program because they hadn't submitted a PSLF application, with the report labeling the process as \"confusing for borrowers.\"\n\nMIT MEDIA LAB DIRECTOR RESIGNS AFTER REPORT ON FINANCIAL TIES TO JEFFREY EPSTEIN\n\n\"As a result, some eligible borrowers may miss the opportunity to have their loans forgiven,\" the report said.\n\nThree percent of borrowers were denied because they had yet to make 120 payments, while 4 percent were denied because they had no qualifying federal loans.\n\nWhat makes it difficult for borrowers is that some of the Department of Education's key resources for students didn't include information on the expanded program and they don't require federal loan services to include TEPSLF information on their websites, according to the report. A Department of Education official did say they will have a new online portal this fall that could include a simplified application process, \"if they had sufficient resources and time.\"\n\nRight now they don't have any specific plans to do so.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDonald Trump recently signed an executive order on Aug. 21., forgiving all student loan debt for any permanently disabled U.S. military veteran.", "description": "The U.S. Department of Education accepted just one percent of applications in the first year of a revamped student loan forgiveness program, according to a government watchdog report.", "authors": ["David Aaro", "David Aaro Is A Freelance Reporter At Fox News Digital Based In New York City."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/DeVos-Loans.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
