The United States, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- work against terrorism financing, according to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n\n\u201cThe TFTC\u2019s coordinated disruption of the financial networks used by the Iranian regime to fund terrorism is a powerful demonstration of Gulf unity,\" Mnuchin said. \"This action demonstrates the unified position of the Gulf nations and the United States that Iran will not be allowed to escalate its malign activity in the region.\"\n\nThis designation is the group's largest to date, the department said, and is focused on entities that support the IRGC and Hezbollah.\n\nSUSPECTED HEZBOLLAH SPY SCOUTED TARGETS IN NEW YORK, OTHER MAJOR CITIES: PROSECUTORS\n\n\"Several of the businesses targeted in this action are providing financial support to the Basij Resistance Force [Basij], a paramilitary force subordinate to the IRGC that have long been used as shock troops by the regime to oppress domestic opposition with brutal displays of violence, while also recruiting, training and deploying fighters to fight in IRGC-fueled conflicts across the region,\" according to the Treasury Department.\n\nAll but four of the sanctioned targets support the Iran-based network Bonyad Taavon Basij, or \u201cBasij Cooperative Foundation,\u201d which \"employs shell companies and other measures to mask Basij ownership and control over a variety of multibillion-dollar business interests in Iran\u2019s automotive, mining, metals and banking industries, many of which have significant international dealings across the Middle East and Europe,\" the Treasury said.\n\nUS LABELS LEBANON BANK WITH HEZBOLLAH TIES A 'GLOBAL TERRORIST,' SANCTIONS IRANIAN NETWORKS LINKED TO REGIME\n\nThe other four designated targets are linked to Hezbollah-affiliated individuals \"who lead and coordinate the group\u2019s operational, intelligence and financial activities in Iraq,\" the department said.\n\n\"These designations again highlight the degree to which Hezbollah operates as a clandestine, terrorist arm of the Iranian regime by smuggling oil for Iran, raising funds for Hezbollah, and sending fighters to Syria for the IRGC-Qods Force on behalf of [IRGC General] Qasem Soleimani,\" the department said.\n\nThe entities and individuals were designated in 2018 as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs), according to the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWe are proud to join forces with our TFTC partners to expose and condemn the Iranian regime\u2019s gross and repeated violations of international norms, from attacking critical oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia to fomenting strife in neighboring countries through regional proxies such as Hezbollah,\" Mnuchin added. \"This coordinated action is a concrete step towards denying the Iranian regime the ability to undermine the stability of the region.\"", "description": "The Treasury Department and six Persian\u00a0Gulf nations announced\u00a0Wednesday that they had jointly sanctioned 25 individuals, corporations and banks\u00a0they say are affiliated with Iran's terror-supporting networks.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon", "Melissa Leon Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
